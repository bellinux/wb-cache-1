40|$|Destination {{memory is}} the ability to {{remember}} the receiver of transmitted information. By means of a destination memory directed forgetting task, we investigated whether participants with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) were able to suppress irrelevant information in destination memory. Twenty-six AD participants and 30 healthy elderly subjects were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> tell 10 different proverbs to 10 different celebrities (List 1). Afterwards, half of the participants were instructed to forget the destinations (i. e., the celebrities) whereas the other half were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> keep them in mind.

Subsequently, all the participants were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> remember the destinations of List 1 and List 2, regardless of the forget or remember instructions. The results show similar destination memory in AD participants who were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> forget the destinations of List 1 and those who were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> retain them. These findings are attributed to inhibitory deficits, by which AD participants have difficulties to suppress irrelevant information in destination memory...|$|R
