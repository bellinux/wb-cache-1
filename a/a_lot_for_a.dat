[...] "here are no plot holes at all, and scrutiny reveals the plot to be air tight." [...] says Rossio. [...] "We had years to think of all this and work it out." [...] It was felt there were many misunderstandings that Scott's take on the plot introduced into the film. In his own defense, Scott cited in an interview with Iain Blair of BNET that only nineteen weeks were provided for the production of the film, which [...] "isn't <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> film like Déjà Vu." ...|$|E

But there's nothing reckless about him; he don't drink, and he don't gamble, and it says <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> young fellow in New Orleans that he don't do one or the other. And he can fight, he can; there ain't no doubt about that. Why, I saw him give the biggest kind of a thrashing to the bully of a lumber camp, where we moored up alongside one night, as ever you seed. The chap {{was big enough to}} eat him, but he didn't have no kind of show. The young un just hit him where he liked, and in five minutes that chap's face was a thing to see, and the lad never got so much as a scratch. I wouldn't have thought as a man could have used his hands like that if I hadn't been thar. I shall be right-down sorry to lose him." ...|$|E

The redskin thinks it just as {{wonderful}} that the white man {{should be able to}} take up a piece of paper covered with black marks, and to read off sense out of them, as you do that {{he should be able to}} read every mark and sign of the wood. He can see, as plain as if the man was still standing on it, the mark of a footprint, and can tell you if it was made by a warrior or a squaw, and how long they have passed by, and whether they were walking fast or slow; while the ordinary white man might go down on his hands and knees, and stare at the ground, and wouldn't be able to see the slightest sign or mark. For a white man, my eyes are good, but they are not a patch on a redskin's. I have lived among the woods since I was a boy; but even now, a redskin lad can pick up a trail and follow it when, look as I will, I can't see as a blade of grass has been bruised. No; these things is partly natur and partly practice. Practice will do <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> white man; but it won't take him up to redskin natur." ...|$|E

In each of the grants, he stipulated the reservation of <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Anglican church, and one for himself. Ultimately, this scheme led to a great deal of contention between New York, Massachusetts, and the settlers in Vermont. The dispute outlived Wentworth's administration, lasting until Vermont was admitted as a state in 1791.|$|R
