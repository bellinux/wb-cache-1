25|$|At this point, Baghdad {{was ruled}} by the Ilkhanate, a {{breakaway}} state of the Mongol Empire, ruling from Iran. In 1401, Baghdad was again sacked, by the Central Asian Turkic conqueror Timur ("Tamerlane"). When his forces took Baghdad, he spared <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> <b>one,</b> and ordered that each of his soldiers bring back two severed human heads. It became a provincial capital controlled by the Mongol Jalayirid (1400–1411), Turkic Kara Koyunlu (1411–1469), Turkic Ak Koyunlu (1469–1508), and the Iranian Safavid (1508–1534) dynasties.|$|E

The military governor of al-Ahwaz {{at the time was}} Sa'id ibn Yaksin, who had a contingent of troops at his disposal. Sa'id, however, decided to withdraw from the city, taking his soldiers with him, and the residents of al-Ahwaz also fled. Consequently, when the Zanj army reached Suq al-Ahwaz they were able to enter and occupy the city, with <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> offering resistance. The fiscal governor Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn al-Mudabbir, who had remained in Suq al-Ahwaz with his pages and servants, was captured by the rebels, and his money, furnishings and slaves were seized.|$|E

25|$|The United States' {{entry into}} World War II impeded Baldwin's Diesel {{development}} program when the War Production Board dictated that Alco and Baldwin produce only steamers and Diesel-electric yard switching engines. Electro-Motive Division (EMD) was assigned {{the task of}} producing road freight Diesels (namely, the FT series). EMD's distinct advantage over its competitors in that product line {{in the years that}} followed World War II, due to the head start in diesel R and production, is beyond doubt, however, assigning it solely to WPB directives is questionable. Longtime GM chairman Alfred P. Sloan presented a timeline in his memoir that belies this assumption, saying that GM's diesel-engine R efforts of the 1920s and 1930s, and its application of model design standardization (yielding lower unit costs) and marketing lessons learned in the automotive industry, were the principal reason for EMD's competitive advantage in the late 1940s and afterward (clearly implying that the wartime production assignments were merely nails in a coffin that Baldwin and Lima had already built for themselves before the war). In his telling, the R needed to adapt earlier Diesels (best suited to marine and stationary use) to locomotive use (smaller; higher power-to-weight ratio; more reliable given more vibration and less maintenance) was a capital-intensive project that <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> among the railroad owners or locomotive builders was willing (latter) or able (former) to invest in during the 1920s and 1930s, save the people of Winton, Electro-Motive, and Charles F. Kettering of the GM Research Corporation.|$|E

[...] The batting cage was destroyed; the bases were pulled up and stolen. Among those taking the field was 21-year-old aspiring actor Michael Clarke Duncan; during the melee, Duncan slid into third base, had a silver belt buckle stolen, and went home with a bat from the dugout. As Bill Veeck stood with a microphone near where home plate had been, begging people to return to the stands, a bonfire raged in center field.|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 1840s, the Audit Office was {{questioning}} the amount spent on Pistrucci. In 1844, the Master of the Mint, William Gladstone restored Pistrucci's salary {{to the full}} £350 and offered him £400 to complete the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci moved his residence from the Mint on Tower Hill to Fine Arts Cottage, Old Windsor, and set to work in full earnest. [...] He was slowed by injuries from a fall, {{and it was not}} until the beginning of 1849 that he submitted the matrices of the medal, and was paid the remaining balance of £1,500. The matrices were so large no one at the Royal Mint was willing to take the risk of hardening them and possibly ruining three decades' work. So only soft impressions were taken, with no medals in gold, silver and bronze as intended, though replicas have since been minted from other dies. Even if the government had struck the medals, there was <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> to present them to, for of the intended recipients, all were dead but the Duke of Wellington.|$|E

A review in The Guardian praised Taran Mansukhani's direction and writing, calling it a [...] "a straight victory for gay comedy": [...] "India's convoluted attitude to gayness finally has its cinematic manifestation in Dostana, one of the gayest films ever made in any country but in which <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> is actually gay.

[...] Describing the film as a [...] "decent-hearted comedy", Rachel Saltz of The New York Times wrote: [...] "Dostana deserves credit. It irreverently normalizes a topic that has been virtually absent from screens in India, and does so using contemporary Bollywood’s best not-so-secret weapon: star power."

50|$|In general, {{cultured pearls}} are less {{valuable}} than natural pearls, whereas imitation pearls have <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> value. <b>One</b> way that jewelers can {{determine whether a}} pearl is cultured or natural {{is to have a}} gemlab perform an X-ray examination of the pearl. If X-rays reveals a nucleus, the pearl is likely a bead-nucleated saltwater pearl. If no nucleus is present, but irregular and small dark inner spots indicating a cavity are visible, combined with concentric rings of organic substance, the pearl is likely a cultured freshwater. Cultured freshwater pearls can often be confused for natural pearls which present as homogeneous pictures which continuously darken toward the surface of the pearl. Natural pearls will often show larger cavities where organic matter has dried out and decomposed.|$|R

Foreman was considered one of the hardest punchers in heavyweight history. In assessing the fight, analysts pointed out that Joe Frazier and Ken Norton—who had given Ali four tough battles and won two of them—had been both devastated by Foreman in second-round knockouts. Ali was 32 years old, and had clearly lost speed and reflexes since his twenties.

2500|$|Historian David Stannard {{writes that}} by the year 1769, the {{destruction}} of the American aboriginal population down to just one-third of one percent of the total American population of 76 million was the most massive genocide in world history, and [...] "there was, at last, <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> left to kill." [...] According to anthropologist Russell Thornton, for the American Indians [...] "the arrival of the Europeans marked the beginning of a long holocaust, although it came not in ovens, as it did for the Jews.

[...] David Quammen likened colonial American practices toward Native Americans to those of Australia toward its aboriginal populations, calling both genocide. Some authors, including Holocaust scholar David Cesarani, have argued that United States government policies in furtherance of its so-called Manifest Destiny constituted genocide.|$|E
2500|$|While the CBS color {{broadcasting}} schedule gradually expanded to twelve {{hours per week}} (but never into prime time), and the color network expanded to eleven affiliates as far west as Chicago, its commercial success was doomed {{by the lack of}} color receivers necessary to watch the programs, the refusal of television manufacturers to create adapter mechanisms for their existing black-and-white sets, and the unwillingness of advertisers to sponsor broadcasts seen by <b>almost</b> <b>no</b> <b>one.</b> CBS had bought a television manufacturer in April, and in September 1951, production began on the only CBS-Columbia color television model, with the first color sets reaching retail stores on September 28.

Only 200 sets had been shipped, and only 100 sold, when CBS discontinued its color television system on October 20, 1951, ostensibly by request of the National Production Authority {{for the duration of the}} Korean War, and bought back all the CBS color sets it could to prevent lawsuits by disappointed customers.
