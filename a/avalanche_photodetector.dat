50|$|Optical {{networks}} using existing telecommunication fiber can {{be implemented}} using hardware similar to existing telecommunication equipment. At the sender, a single photon source can be created by heavily attenuating a standard telecommunication laser such that {{the mean number of}} photons per pulse is less than 1. For receiving, an <b>avalanche</b> <b>photodetector</b> can be used. Various methods of phase or polarization control can be used such as interferometers and beam splitters. In the case of entanglement based protocols, entangled photons can be generated through spontaneous parametric down-conversion. In both cases, the telecom fiber can be multiplexed to send non-quantum timing and control signals.|$|E
40|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made recently in demonstrating that silicon photonics is a promising technology for low-cost optical detectors, modulators and light sources 1 – 12. It has often been assumed, however, that their performance is inferior to InP-based devices.

The essential principle is that photon-counting pulses are converted to an analogue signal that is continuously proportional to the number of detected photons during the last integration time. The integration time should be approximately equal to the time an object is illuminated in the flow chamber. In this way, the photon burst due to real events is measured correctly and discriminated from the background pulses (fluorescence and Raman).
