5|$|Christians {{from many}} traditions were critical, saying the {{movement}} was hyper-emotional, misused Scripture and lost focus on Christ by overemphasizing the Holy Spirit. Within a short time ministers were warning their congregations {{to stay away from}} the Azusa Street Mission. Some called the police <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the building shut down.|$|E
5|$|Earp was {{a lifelong}} gambler {{and was always}} looking for a quick way to make money. After leaving Tombstone, Earp went to San Francisco, where he reunited with Josephine Earp. She became his common-law wife. They joined a gold rush to Eagle City, Idaho, where they owned mining {{interests}} and a saloon. They left there to race horses and open a saloon during a real estate boom in San Diego, California. Back in San Francisco, Wyatt raced horses again, but his reputation suffered irreparably when he refereed the Fitzsimmons–Sharkey boxing match and called a foul that led many to believe that he fixed the fight. They moved briefly to Yuma, Arizona, before joining the Nome Gold Rush in 1899. In partnership with Charlie Hoxie, they opened a two-story saloon called the Dexter and made an estimated $80,000 (about $2 million in 2017 dollars). Returning to the lower 48, they opened another saloon in Tonopah, Nevada, the site of a new gold find. Around 1911, Earp began working several mining claims in Vidal, California, retiring in the hot summers with Josephine to Los Angeles. Earp made friends among early Western actors in Hollywood <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> his story told. He was portrayed in film only once before he died, and very briefly, in the 1923 film Wild Bill Hickok.|$|E

25|$|He {{started his}} cricket {{career as a}} wicket-keeper and had been a {{promising}} junior cricketer, captaining the Queensland Colts in 1949 and 1950. With Queenslander Don Tallon keeping wicket for Australia and future Test player Wally Grout the new state gloveman, Sanders was at best the third choice wicket-keeper for Queensland. As a result he gave up the glovework <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> state selection as a specialist batsman.|$|E
25|$|On 7 February 1919, the Royal Navy {{formally}} transferred H15 and {{her sister}} H14 to the Royal Canadian Navy. The two boats, both in Bermuda still, had lain unused since December. However, even though United Kingdom had gifted the two submarines, Canada was expected to find crews to move the boats from Bermuda. The Royal Canadian Navy did not want them <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the Admiralty to take them back.|$|E

25|$|At {{the age of}} 21, Bishop {{fatally shot}} her 18-year-old brother, Seth Bishop, on December 6, 1986, at their home in Braintree, Massachusetts. Bishop fired two shots from a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun (one into her bedroom wall, then one into her brother's chest {{while they were in}} the kitchen with their mother). Later she pointed the weapon at a moving vehicle on the {{adjacent}} road <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into the vehicle.

He became obsessed with getting to know her. She fell for his charming and fascinating personality, partly due to his immense financial status.

25|$|Moore made a {{stand before}} the old Roman town of Lugo on 6 January and offered battle but, initially, Soult's forces were too strung out. Over two days Soult {{concentrated}} his troops <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Ney to send a division from Villa Franca del Bierzo but Ney sent few troops. By the 8th Soult was prepared for battle, but Moore, imagining Ney was outflanking him, slipped away that night, shooting 500 foundered horses and destroying artillery caissons and food stores. Now realizing {{he could not get}} to Vigo and fearing his army would disintegrate on the way, he ordered the transports to Betanzos Bay between Corunna and Ferrol and he headed for Corunna.|$|E
25|$|The {{second time}} it tells of Froda and Ingeld is in Book 7, but here Hrothgar is {{replaced}} by a Harald and Halga by a Haldanus. It is the Scandinavian version of the feud, similar to the one told in the Skjöldunga saga, Bjarkarímur and Hrólfr Kraki's saga, where the Heaðobards are forgotten and the feud with Froda and Ingeld has become a family feud. The main plot is that Ingeld had the sons Frodo (Froda) and Harald (corresponds to Healfdene). The relationship between Ingeld and Froda was thus reversed, a reversal also found in the Skjöldunga saga and in the Bjarkarímur. Froda killed his brother <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of his nephews Harald (corresponds to Hrothgar) and Haldanus (corresponds to Halga). After some adventures, the two brothers burnt their uncle to death inside his house and avenged their father.|$|E
25|$|Blackmore {{was very}} {{concerned}} with Protestantism. He joined the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in America in 1704. He wrote Just Prejudices against the Arian Hypothesis, putatively against Deism and Unitarianism in 1721 and then, to help matters, wrote Modern Arians Unmasked in the same year. He also produced A New Version of the Psalms of David in 1721 <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the Church of England to accept them as canonical translations. The next year, he resigned his governing position in the College of Physicians, and he also continued his campaign against supposed Arians with Redemption. In 1724, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel was set to publish Blackmore's Psalms as official for America, but the Bishop of London, Edmund Gibson (a conservative, but a Whig), opposed the project and kept it from coming to fruition.|$|E

25|$|Newkirk {{helped her}} mother {{out in the}} leper colony—packing pills and rolling bandages, {{stuffing}} toys for orphans, and feeding strays—and says that this informed her view that anyone in need, including animals, was worthy of concern, along with her mother's advice that it doesn't matter who suffers, but how. She {{tells the story of}} an early experience of trying to rescue an animal, when she heard laughter in the alleyway behind the family home in New Delhi. A group of people had bound a dog's legs, muzzled him, then lowered him into a muddy ditch, laughing as they watched him try to escape. Newkirk asked her servant to bring the dog to her, <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him to drink some water, but someone had packed his throat with mud, and he died in her arms. She told the Financial Times that it was a turning point.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, Hotelito Desconocido {{planned to}} make a large {{expansion}} on the beach <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> two concessions from the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) to do the constructions. The first request was to expand the hotel on the beach by 5,577.1 m2 (60,031.4 sq ft) on one part, and 5,330.9 m2 (57,381.3 sq ft) on another. The petition passed through the Tomatlán Customs Agency without many problems. It {{then went to the}} SEMARNAT offices in Jalisco, where it was reviewed and passed after they considered that Hotelito Desconocido met the required regulations. The following year, however, the National Commission of Protected Natural Areas (CONANP) federal agency analyzed the expansion project and rejected it after considering that the natural reserve area Playón De Mismaloya would be affected by the construction. It specifically mentioned that the endangered turtle and bird species were not guaranteed to be protected if the construction took place.|$|E

25|$|In June, Gravano was {{approached}} by Ruggiero and, supposedly at Gotti's behest, given orders to murder capo Robert DiBernardo for making negative remarks about Gotti's leadership. Gravano was friendly with DiBernardo <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the murder called off until {{he had a chance}} to speak with Gotti after his trial. Ruggiero claimed to have met again with Gotti and told Gravano that the boss wanted DiBernardo killed right away. Gravano arranged a meeting with DiBernardo where Joe Paruta, a member of Gravano's crew, shot DiBernardo twice in the back of the head as the underboss watched. Gravano later learned that Ruggiero was $250,000 in debt to DiBernardo and realized Ruggiero may have fabricated the orders from Gotti or simply lied to Gotti about what DiBernardo was accused of saying in order to erase the debt and improve his own standing in the family. In any event, DiBernardo's death proved profitable for Gravano, as he took over the deceased man's control of Teamsters Local 282.|$|E
25|$|This {{reflects}} {{the idea that}} workers {{have a vested interest}} in their own well-being, and do not benefit from working above the defined rate of work when it will not increase their remuneration. He therefore proposed that the work practice that had been developed in most work environments was crafted, intentionally or unintentionally, to be very inefficient in its execution. He posited that time and motion studies combined with rational analysis and synthesis could uncover one best method for performing any particular task, and that prevailing methods were seldom equal to these best methods. Crucially, Taylor himself prominently acknowledged that if each employee's compensation was linked to their output, their productivity would go up. Thus his compensation plans usually included piece rates. In contrast, some later adopters of time and motion studies ignored this aspect <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> large productivity gains while passing little or no compensation gains to the workforce, which contributed to resentment against the system.|$|E
25|$|On 19 November the Red Army began {{a counter}} offensive, named Operation Uranus. Within days, the Soviets had encircled some 300,000 German, Italian, Romanian and Hungarian {{soldiers}} {{in the city of}} Stalingrad. It was decided by Hitler and the OKL to supply the Axis forces by air. Richthofen was horrified. He telephoned Berchtesgaden <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through to Hitler, but none of his aides would put him through. He tried to convince Göring that his air fleet did not have the resources to sustain an air lift, and that the best option would be to attempt a breakout before the Soviet forces entrenched. He flew to Manstein's headquarters, and the Field Marshal agreed a breakout must take place. With the Sixth Army preserved, the initiative could be regained later. He made this request to Hitler. The Soviet divisions were smaller than their German counterparts: but they had 97. Holding Stalingrad was now impossible.|$|E
