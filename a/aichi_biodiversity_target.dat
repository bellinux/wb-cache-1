In the intervening period much {{action has been}} taken on creating protected areas as the key route to delivering area-based conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Rather less {{attention has been paid}} to OECMs due in part to a lack of guidance on what areas should or should not be included under this label. An IUCN World Conservation Congress Resolution in 2012 called on IUCN 2 ̆ 7 s World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA) to assist the CBD by providing technical guidance on interpretation of the wording in <b>Aichi</b> <b>Biodiversity</b> <b>Target</b> 11. IUCN WCPA established a Task Force in 2015 to provide guidance on OECMs, in terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats. This Task Force has already met several times and has a global membership of more than 100 experts. The official call made by the CBD in 2016 for guidance explicitly recognizes the role of the IUCN Task Force in fulfilling this guidance need. This paper provides the background to OECMs and an initial analysis on the type and nature of measures that may qualify as OECMs under Aichi Target 11. Successful implementation will be dependent on clear principles and guidance, but also on a far better awareness among conservationists and other sectors on the purpose and scope of all 20 Aichi Targets. The paper will also be of value to discussions and implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 on the ocean. Some generic examples of areas likely to qualify as OECMs in the ocean are identified, along with an analysis of how OECMs complement and supplement fisheries and other management measures to promote more sustainable use. Greater recognition and reporting is needed on fisheries measures under Aichi Target 6.

40|$|ABSTRACTIn {{the tenth}} Conference of Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) held in Nagoya in 2010, {{it was decided}} that 17 % of {{terrestrial}} and 10 % of marine areas should be protected globally by 2020. It was also stated that conservation decision-making should be based on sound science. Here, we review how recent scientific literature about spatial conservation prioritization analyses and macro-ecology corresponds to the information needs posed by the <b>Aichi</b> <b>Biodiversity</b> <b>Target</b> 11. A literature search was performed in Web of Science to identify potentially relevant research articles published in 2010 - 2012. Additionally, we searched all articles published since 2000 in five high-profile scientific journals. The studies were classified by extent and resolution, and we evaluated the type and breadth of data that was utilized (This information is included in a supplementary table to facilitate further research). Implementation of the Aichi Targets would best be supported by broad-extent, high-resolution, and data-rich studies that can directly support realistic decision-making about allocation of conservation efforts at sub-continental to global extents. When looking at all evaluation criteria simultaneously, we found little research that directly supports the analytical needs of the CBD. There are many narrow- extent, low-resolution, narrow-scope, or theoretically-aimed studies that are important in developing theory and local practices, but which are not adequate for guiding conservation management at a continental scale. Even national analyses are missing for many countries. Global-extent, high-resolution analyses using broad biodiversity and anthropogenic data are needed in order to inform decision making under the CBD resolutions. © 2014 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação.

40|$|Protected Areas (PAs) are {{a central}} part of {{biodiversity}} conservation strategies around the world. Today, PAs cover c 15 % of the Earth’s land mass and c 3 % of the global oceans. These numbers are expected to grow rapidly to meet the Convention on Biological Diversity’s <b>Aichi</b> <b>Biodiversity</b> <b>target</b> 11, which aims to see 17 % and 10 % of terrestrial and marine biomes protected, respectively, by 2020. This target also requires countries to ensure that PAs protect an “ecologically representative” sample of their biodiversity. At present, there is no clear definition of what desirable ecological representation looks like, or guidelines of how to standardize its assessment as the PA estate grows. We propose a systematic approach to measure ecological representation in PA networks using the Protection Equality (PE) metric, which measures how equally ecological features, such as habitats, within a country’s borders are protected. Extending research in Barr et al. (2011), we present an R package and two Protection Equality (PE) measures; proportional to area PE, and fixed area PE, which measure the representativeness of a country’s PA network. We illustrate the PE metrics with two case studies: coral reef protection across countries and ecoregions in the Coral Triangle, and representation of ecoregions of six of the largest countries in the world. Our results provide repeatable transparency to the issue of representation in PA networks and provide a starting point for further discussion, evaluation and testing of representation metrics. They also highlight clear shortcomings in current PA networks, particularly where they are biased towards certain assemblage types or habitats. Our proposed metrics should be used to report on measuring progress towards the representation component of Aichi Target 11. The PE metrics can be used to measure the representation of any kind of ecological feature including: species, ecoregions, processes or habitats...|$|E

According to the <b>Aichi</b> <b>Biodiversity</b> <b>Target</b> 11 adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity, the protected area network should be expanded to at least 17 % of the terrestrial world by 2020 ([URL] To maximize conservation outcomes, it is crucial to identify the best expansion areas. Here we show that there is a very high potential to increase protection of ecoregions and vertebrate species by expanding the protected area network, but also identify considerable risk of ineffective outcomes due to land-use change and uncoordinated actions between countries. We use distribution data for 24, 757 terrestrial vertebrates assessed under the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) 'red list of threatened species, and terrestrial ecoregions 10 (827), modified by land-use models for the present and 2040, and introduce techniques for global and balanced spatial conservation prioritization.

Second, if projected land-use change by 2040 (ref. 11) takes place, it becomes infeasible to reach the currently possible protection levels, and over 1, 000 threatened species would lose more than 50 % of their present effective rangesworldwide.

40|$|Although {{many people}} have {{expressed}} alarm that we are witnessing a mass extinction, few projections have been quantified, owing to limited availability of time-series data on threatened organisms, especially plants. To quantify the risk of extinction, we need to monitor changes in population size over time for as many species as possible. Here, we present the world's first quantitative projection of plant species loss at a national level, with stochastic simulations {{based on the results}} of population censuses of 1618 threatened plant taxa in 3574 map cells of ca. 100 km 2. More than 500 lay botanists helped monitor those taxa in 1994 - 1995 and in 2003 - 2004. We projected that between 370 and 561 vascular plant taxa will go extinct in Japan during the next century if past trends of population decline continue. This extinction rate is approximately two to three times the global rate. Using time-series data, we show that existing national protected areas (PAs) covering ca. 7 % of Japan will not adequately prevent population declines: even core PAs can protect at best < 60 % of local populations from decline. Thus, the <b>Aichi</b> <b>Biodiversity</b> <b>Target</b> to expand PAs to 17 % of land (and inland water) areas, as committed to by many national governments, is not enough: only 29. 2 % of currently threatened species will become non-threatened under the assumption that probability of protection success by PAs is 0. 5, which our assessment shows is realistic.

40|$|Assessment of the {{progress}} of the <b>Aichi</b> <b>Biodiversity</b> <b>Targets</b> set by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the safeguarding of ecosystems from the perverse negative impacts caused by Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Plus (REDD+) requires the development of spatiotemporally robust and sensitive indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem health. Recently, it has been proposed that tree-community composition based on count-plot surveys could serve as a robust, sensitive, and cost-effective indicator for forest intactness in Bornean logged-over rain forests. In this study, we developed an algorithm to map tree-community composition across the entire landscape based on Landsat imagery. We targeted six forest management units (FMUs), each of which ranged from 50, 000 to 100, 000 ha in area, covering a broad geographic range spanning the most area of Borneo. Approximately fifty 20 m-radius circular plots were established in each FMU, and the differences in tree-community composition at a genus level among plots were examined for trees with diameter at breast height ≥ 10 cm using an ordination with non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS). Subsequently, we developed a linear regression model based on Landsat metrics (e. g., reflectance value, vegetation indices and textures) to explain the nMDS axis- 1 scores of the plots, and extrapolated the model to the landscape to establish a tree-community composition map in each FMU. The adjusted R 2 values based on a cross-validation approach between the predicted and observed nMDS axis- 1 scores indicated a close correlation, ranging from 0. 54 to 0. 69. Histograms of the frequency distributions of extrapolated nMDS axis- 1 scores were derived from each map and used to quantitatively diagnose the forest intactness of the FMUs. Our study indicated that tree-community composition, which was reported as a robust indicator of forest intactness, could be mapped at a landscape level to quantitatively assess the spatial patterns of intactness in Bornean rain forests.

One of the Targets (Target 17) called for each country to revise its National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plan (NBSAP) in accordance with the <b>Aichi</b> <b>Biodiversity</b> <b>Targets.</b> From 2010 to November 2016, virtually all countries have revised, or are currently completing the revision of, their NBSAP. As of November 2016, 123 countries (76 of them eligible for official development assistance) have submitted post- 2010 NBSAPs. At the same time, the world {{agreed to an}} ambitious set of 17 Goals and 169 Targets in 2015, called the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).   The absence of a widely accepted taxonomy for describing NBSAP actions makes any systematic and cross-cutting analysis of NBSAPs difficult. Moreover, the collective contribution of specific NBSAP actions to SDGs has not yet been studied. The purpose of this report is to systematically understand the breadth and depth of actions proposed across all NBSAPs, to propose a common framework for analysis, and to understand the relationship between NBSAPs and the SDGs The data in this report comes from more than 6000 actions included in NBSAPs of 60 countries. These NBSAPs have all been submitted to the Secretariat of the CBD after 2010, and all are from countries eligible to received funding from the Global Environmental Facility.   The researchers tagged each of the actions in this analysis not only by the thematic categories and generic actions of this taxonomy, but also by the associated primary and secondary SDGs and their associated targets (as well as by <b>Aichi</b> <b>Biodiversity</b> <b>Targets).</b> In doing so, the collective impact of the contribution of NBSAPs toward fulfilling the SDGs is beginning to emerge. The data from this analysis are far richer and more complex than this interim report can convey. However, it is clear from this preliminary analysis that the impact of NBSAP actions extends far beyond Goal 14 (Life Below Water) and Goal 15 (Life on Land). The NBSAP examples of actions provided under each of the categories illustrate how a single action can contribute to multiple goals. The actions included across all NBSAPs would, if fully implemented, catalyze progress in national food security, water security, livelihoods, economic growth, disaster risk reduction, health, gender and climate resilience, among other goals. Furthermore, because NBSAPs are adopted as policy instruments, they provide a ready pathway for fast implementation of national sustainable development goals. Investing in biodiversity and ecosystems through NBSAP actions also ensures that no one is left behind in the implementation of the SDGs. Nature provides a safety net to billions of people around the world: 1. 6 billion people depend on forests for jobs, livelihoods, food and fuel; one out of eight people depend on fisheries for their livelihoods; and more than 4 billion people depend on medicines derived from forests for their health.   Investing in nature helps ensure that the most vulnerable people in society, especially the more than 800 million people living in poverty, have a durable safety net. The recommendations included {{at the end of this}} report highlight the potential need for targeted support to countries to implement key thematic areas. The authors hope that this preliminary analysis will enable governments, and the organizations that support them, to focus their efforts on supporting those thematic areas that will have the most impact in accelerating progress in implementing NBSAP actions. They also hope this report will encourage donor organizations to consider supporting the implementation of NBSAP actions that have direct SDG outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Human {{pressure}} on ecosystems {{is among the}} major drivers of biodiversity loss. As biodiversity {{plays a key role}} in supporting the human enterprise, its decline puts the well-being of human societies at risk. Halting biodiversity loss is therefore a key policy priority, as reflected in the 2020 <b>Aichi</b> <b>Biodiversity</b> <b>Targets</b> under strategic goal A. The Ecological Footprint has become a widely used metric for natural capital and ecosystem accounting, and is frequently cited in the sustainability debate, where it is often used for tracking human-induced pressures on ecosystems and biodiversity. Given its potential role as an indirect metric for biodiversity-related policies, this paper breaks down the Ecological Footprint into its components and analyzes resource and ecosystem service flows at an international level. We discuss its usefulness in tracking the underlying drivers of habitat impacts and biodiversity loss. We find that: China is a major net importer of all biomass biocapacity components; the largest net exporters of forest biocapacity are not low-income countries; a very high proportion of the Ecological Footprint of fishing grounds is traded internationally; Singapore and at least three Middle East countries are almost wholly reliant on net imports for the cropland biocapacity they consume...|$|R
40|$|In Euro-Mediterranean coastal areas, {{particularly}} {{along the}} coastal zones of Spain, France and Italy, high biodiversity values - derived {{not only from}} natural, but also from human factors, such as grazing and agricultural activities - are coupled with traditionally intense tourist flows, related to mass seaside tourism. Since the 1950 s, this type of tourism, and two major socio-economic processes associated with itâ€”â€˜litoralization' and abandonment of grazing and agricultural activities in inland areasâ€”has been causing significant losses of biodiversity, along the coast and in the hinterland. Considering this critical situation, this paper investigates how tourism {{and some of its}} "threats" can be turned into an opportunity for reaching the <b>Aichi</b> <b>Biodiversity</b> <b>Targets</b> (Target 5, in particular) within the context of Euro- Mediterranean coastal areas. To this aim, some examples of policies developed within three coastal protected areas (â€˜Protected Landscapes', IUCN Category V: the Parque Natural de la Albufera de Valencia, Spain, the Parc Naturel RÃ©gional de la Narbonnaise en MÃ©diterranÃ©e, France, and the Parco Naturale Regionale del Conero, Italy) for overcoming the tourism-biodiversity conflicts are analysed. These parks can be regarded as experimental laboratories for policies relating to unprotected coastal areas as well...|$|R
