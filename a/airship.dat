5|$|The article {{explains}} {{the sequence of}} events of this August 4 New York City demonstration flight of 1895. When the reporter was all positioned and ready in the sky-cycle he gave word to the ground crew {{to let go of the}} ropes that held the hydrogen balloon back and it immediately lifted the sky-cycle into the air. The <b>airship</b> drifted up slowly at first, going towards the factory roof peaks. The driver-reporter immediately dropped one of the sandbag weights and the sky-cycle <b>airship</b> rose up sharply, avoiding the building roofs. When the <b>airship</b> was about a thousand feet high the attached balloon propeller revolved and the sky-cycle <b>airship</b> flew over the East River. The steamships and tugs that spotted the sky-cycle floating above tooted their whistles.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the Hindenburg <b>airship</b> was a notorious example of hydrogen combustion and the cause is still debated. The visible orange flames in that incident {{were the result of}} a rich mixture of hydrogen to oxygen combined with carbon compounds from the <b>airship</b> skin.|$|E
5|$|<b>Airship</b> Industries {{managed a}} major {{marketing}} coup with {{the inclusion of}} their Skyship 500 series blimp in the film. At the time <b>Airship</b> Industries were producing a fleet of blimps which were recognisable over many capitals of the world offering tours, or advertising sponsorship deals. As all Bond films have included the most current technology, this included the lighter than air interest.|$|E
25|$|Solar ships {{can refer}} to solar powered <b>airships</b> or hybrid <b>airships.</b>|$|R
25|$|French inventors {{have built}} man-powered <b>airships</b> and {{balloons}}. Solar balloons and solar <b>airships</b> are {{new types of}} balloons and <b>airships.</b> Because lift is supplied through buoyancy, human power can be devoted to thrust.|$|R
50|$|A-NSE, a French company, {{manufactures}} {{and operates}} <b>airships</b> and aerostats. For 2 years, A-NSE has been testing its <b>airships</b> for the French Army. <b>Airships</b> and aerostats are operated to provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support. Their <b>airships</b> include many innovative {{features such as}} water ballast take-off and landing systems, variable geometry envelopes and thrust-vectoring systems.|$|R
5|$|Myers {{designed}} {{a new type}} balloon vessel based on Carlotta's discoveries of aerodynamics and how <b>airship</b> bodies acted in the sky. Carlotta {{was the first woman}} to use a maneuverable <b>airship.</b> She used a cloth screw-sail and also a cloth rudder for controlling the steering of her aeroplane platform. The platform car device weighted 11 pounds. This {{was the first time that}} an ordinary spherical balloon could be controlled by a person. Myers then incorporated new features into balloons based on Carlotta's findings. For a more efficient steerable <b>airship</b> vessel he made his next balloon gas bag bottom flat so that it would act like an inclined plane.|$|E
5|$|On 10 January 1994 a press {{reception}} {{to announce}} The Division Bell and world tour {{was held at}} a former US Naval Air Station in North Carolina, in the US. A purpose-built Skyship 600 <b>airship,</b> manufactured in the UK, toured the US until it returned to Weeksville, and was destroyed by a thunderstorm on 27 June. Pieces of the aircraft were sold as souvenirs. The band held another reception, in the UK, on 21 March. This time they used an A60 <b>airship,</b> translucent, and painted {{to look like a}} fish, which took journalists on a tour of London. The <b>airship,</b> which was lit internally so it glowed in the night sky, was also flown in northern Europe.|$|E
5|$|On 5 April, Princess Matoika {{carried a}} group of 18 men and three {{officers}} of the U.S. Navy who were to attempt a transatlantic flight in the rigid <b>airship</b> R38, being built in England for the Navy. Several {{of the group that}} traveled on the Matoika were among the 45men killed when the <b>airship</b> crashed on 24August 1921.|$|E
50|$|Rigid <b>airships</b> {{consist of}} a {{structural}} framework usually covered in doped fabric containing a number of gasbags or cells containing a lifting gas. In the majority of <b>airships</b> constructed before World War II highly flammable hydrogen was used for this purpose, resulting in many <b>airships</b> such as the British R101 and the German Hindenburg being lost in catastrophic fires. The inert gas helium was used by American <b>airships</b> in the 1920s and '30s and is used in all modern <b>airships.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Thermal <b>airships</b> {{have the}} {{advantage}} of being much less expensive than helium-based <b>airships.</b> They are also routinely deflated after each flight and can be readily packed for storage and/or transport, making them [...] blimps rather than rigid <b>airships.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Non-rigid <b>airships</b> {{are often}} called [...] "Blimps". Most, but not all, of the American Goodyear <b>airships</b> have been blimps.|$|R
5|$|The Lebaudy Patrie was a {{semi-rigid}} <b>airship</b> {{built for}} the French army in Moisson, France, by sugar producers Lebaudy Fr√®res. Designed by Henri Julliot, Lebaudy's chief engineer, the Patrie was completed in November 1906 and {{handed over to the}} military the following month. The Patrie bears the distinction of being the first <b>airship</b> ordered for military service by the French army.|$|E
5|$|The sky-cycle <b>airship</b> {{continued}} {{to climb to}} about two thousand feet and then traveled north using the East River as a landmark and went to East Sixtieth Street. The reporter then steered the sky-cycle to One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Street. There he crossed the East River again and then hovered over Greenpoint. The reporter flew the sky-cycle until almost dark and landed safely at the property of P. B. Gupther in Yonkers. Gupther helped the reporter deflate the balloon and pack the <b>airship</b> down {{to the size of}} a flat carpet bag. He then drove the reporter with his sky-cycle <b>airship</b> to the railroad station so he could get back to his place of origin.|$|E
5|$|Zorin, who {{had escaped}} in his <b>airship</b> with Scarpine and Mortner, abducts Sutton, but Bond {{grabs hold of}} the airship's mooring rope. Zorin tries to knock Bond off the rope, but Bond manages to moor the <b>airship</b> to the {{framework}} of the Golden Gate Bridge. Sutton attacks Zorin, and in the fracas, Mortner and Scarpine are temporarily knocked out. Sutton flees and joins Bond out on the bridge, but Zorin pursues them with an axe. The ensuing fight between Zorin and Bond culminates with Zorin falling to his death in the waters of San Francisco Bay. An enraged Mortner attacks Bond using sticks of dynamite, but Bond cuts the <b>airship</b> cable free, which causes Mortner to drop the dynamite in the cabin. The dynamite explodes, killing Mortner and Scarpine and destroying the <b>airship.</b> General Gogol awards Bond the Order of Lenin for foiling Zorin's strategy. Afterwards, Bond and Sutton make love in the shower of the Sutton home.|$|E
25|$|There {{were strong}} gales {{at the end}} of September 1918 causing {{difficulties}} landing the <b>airships</b> returning to the base. The extreme conditions resulted in four of the <b>airships</b> having to be 'ripped' once they had been maneuvered into the shelter of the hangars. Ripped is the term used when the rip cord attached to the control car is deliberately pulled to deflate panels sited on the <b>airships.</b> The <b>airships</b> ripped included a C10A and a SSZ65.|$|R
40|$|Technological {{developments}} and environmental concerns are among several {{reasons that are}} bringing up once again the concept of new air transportation vehicles like the <b>airships.</b> Nowadays <b>airships</b> have several applications such as: heavy cargo and point-to-point transportation, advertising, observation, patrolling and monitoring, research, and tourism. This work examines the technological improvements in this particular sector of aviation and shows the feasibility of <b>airships</b> in certain market niches. Key-words: <b>Airships,</b> Cargo and Passenger Air Transportation, Market Niche...|$|R
50|$|The Royal Navy {{continued}} {{development of}} rigid <b>airships</b> {{until the end}} of the war. Eight rigid <b>airships</b> had been completed by the armistice, (No. 9r, four 23 Class, two R23X Class and one R31 Class), although several more were in an advanced state of completion by the war's end.Both France and Italy continued to use <b>airships</b> throughout the war. France preferred the nonrigid type, whereas Italy flew 49 semirigid <b>airships</b> in both the scouting and bombing roles.|$|R
5|$|Cliff {{flies to}} the rendezvous, where Sinclair demands that Cliff {{give him the}} rocket pack. Cliff divulges to the mobsters that the actor is a Nazi; Valentine's gang turn their weapons on Sinclair and Lothar, but Sinclair summons sixty heavily armed Nazi S.A. commandos hidden at the observatory. The Nazi rigid <b>airship</b> Luxembourg appears {{overhead}} to evacuate Sinclair. FBI agents suddenly announce their presence, having secretly surrounded the area; they and the mobsters join forces to battle the Nazis. Sinclair and Lothar escape, dragging Jenny with them aboard the <b>airship.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{their next}} mission, {{the party is}} sent to the city of Bafsk to prevent the {{construction}} of a large <b>airship</b> known as the Dreadnought; however, it takes off just as they arrive. After retrieving the Sunfire, a weapon which can blow up the Dreadnought, they watch helplessly as an <b>airship</b> with Hilda on board is captured by the Dreadnought. When the Dreadnought lands to stock up on supplies, the party rescues Hilda and throws the Sunfire into the airship's engine. Before escaping from the explosion, the party encounters a dark knight whom Maria thinks she recognizes as Leon.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 {{he settled}} {{with his family}} at Bramdean House in Alresford, and was {{appointed}} Commander of the Balloon Sections, based at Aldershot {{under the command of}} Col James Templer. In 1906, having briefly become the Balloon Companies, the organisation became the School of Ballooning with Capper as its Commandant. At about the same time the Balloon Factory was split off and moved to a new site nearby at Farnborough and, on Templer's retirement, Capper also became its Superintendent and was given the brevet rank of full colonel. Templer was retained at the factory under Capper to complete the development Britain's first military <b>airship,</b> the Nulli Secundus ("second to none") in a purpose-built <b>airship</b> shed.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} nations {{operated}} <b>airships</b> {{between the two}} world wars. Britain, the United States and Germany were the only constructors of rigid <b>airships,</b> with Italy and France making limited use of Zeppelins handed over as war reparations. Italy, the Soviet Union, the United States and Japan mainly operated semirigid <b>airships.</b>|$|R
50|$|Notable <b>airships</b> {{include the}} American sister ships USS Akron and USS Macon, and the German Hindenburg class <b>airship's</b> Hindenburg and Graf Zeppelin II.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Sokka, Toph, and Suki hijack a Fire Nation <b>airship,</b> {{and use it}} {{to destroy}} Ozai's <b>airship</b> fleet, {{crippling}} his forces before they can burn down the Erath Kingdom. In Ba Sing Se, the Order of the White Lotus, led by Iroh, lays siege to the Fire Nation forces within the city, with the intention of re-conquering it {{in the name of the}} Earth Kingdom. Aang reappears and begins to duel the Phoenix King. When Aang refuses to kill Ozai despite given the opportunity, Ozai begins to gain an advantage in the fight.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{was already}} {{concerned}} in 1891 that Europe {{was much more}} advanced in balloon technology than the United States. He sent a letter of concern to the national newspapers claiming that {{if any of the}} European military powers wanted to they could annihilate New York City or any major city in northeastern United States. Newspapers printed his concerns that the next big war would be fought in the sky. Myers pointed out that Germany, France, England, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Russia, Italy and China all had aeronautical apparatus, schools of practice, and secret experimental construction plants making state-of-the-art propeller power driven airships for war. He pointed out as early as October 1890 Commandant Charles Renard was in possession of a motor that could drive La France dirigible <b>airship</b> twenty-eight miles an hour and such an <b>airship</b> or a war <b>airship</b> twice that size traveling at forty-five miles an hour could totally destroy any major city in America without difficulty because of its speed. He was encouraging the government to recognize this and to prepare properly against this potential threat.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the items}} from the expedition, {{including}} the balloon-silk boat and the tent, are {{on display at the}} Andr√©eexpeditionen Polar Centre at Grenna Museum, Sweden. The expedition is also featured in the Spitsbergen <b>Airship</b> Museum in Longyearbyen, Svalbard.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} decade of the twentieth century, {{semi-rigid}} <b>airships</b> were considered more suitable for military use because, unlike rigid <b>airships,</b> they could be deflated, stored and transported by land or by sea. Non-rigid <b>airships</b> had a limited lifting capacity due to the strength limitations of the envelope and rigging materials then in use.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the age of}} {{the great}} <b>airships,</b> the United States built two rigid <b>airships,</b> [...] and , with onboard hangars able to house a number of Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk biplane fighters. These {{airborne}} aircraft carriers operated successfully for several years. These <b>airships</b> utilized an internal hangar bay using a [...] "trapeze" [...] to hold the aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The {{most famous}} <b>airships</b> today are the passenger-carrying rigid <b>airships</b> {{made by the}} German Zeppelin company, {{especially}} the Graf Zeppelin of 1928 and the Hindenburg of 1936.|$|R
5|$|The Patries {{design as}} a {{semi-rigid}} <b>airship</b> {{required that the}} pressure of both the lifting gas in the gas-bag and {{the air in the}} ballonet be sufficient to maintain the airship's overall shape. Sufficient hydrogen was pumped into the gas-bag to enable the <b>airship</b> to ascend to its intended maximum operating altitude of , at which height the ballonet would occupy approximately one-fifth of the total gas-bag volume. Descent was made by releasing hydrogen from the gas-bag and then pumping air into the ballonet to take up the volume of the released gas, a process which was repeated incrementally until the desired rate of descent or altitude had been achieved.|$|E
5|$|The <b>airship</b> had tumultuous {{times at}} the start. Professor A. W. Bernard of Nashville, Tennessee took claim to his {{invention}} in 1897. Myers sent telegrams to editors of newspapers {{in the month of}} May of that year explaining that he was the inventor of the world's first 'sky-cycle' <b>airship</b> in spite of what Bernard and others said. Myers explained to the newspapers that his invention had already been displayed in front of a group of people in New York City in August 1895. Myers showed to them that the basic principles of the controllable <b>airship</b> were already patented by him and his wife on May 26, 1885. He further explained that the only 'sky-cycle' patent ever issued to anybody was granted to him on April 20, 1897. Bernard was trying to stake claim that it was his invention and had really just made a duplicate of Myers' previous recorded patents.|$|E
5|$|Another {{departure}} from the gameplay of Final Fantasy X is in its world navigation system: players can visit almost every location in Spira from early in the game, transported via the <b>airship</b> Celsius. This is a deviation from the overall Final Fantasy series, where the most efficient means of transportation is typically not obtained {{until late in the}} game.|$|E
5000|$|Streamlined Parsifal-shaped rigid (or semirigid) <b>airships</b> {{are usually}} {{referred}} to as [...] "Zeppelin", because of the fame that this company has acquired due {{to the number of}} <b>airships</b> it produced.|$|R
50|$|One of the ZPG-2 <b>airships</b> {{was built}} or {{modified}} with external engines to test {{systems for the}} follow on ZPG-3W <b>airships</b> and is some times {{referred to as a}} ZPG-2 1/2.|$|R
50|$|In 2003 OSKBES MAI {{started to}} work on {{different}} aircraft, <b>airships</b> and autogyros. It designed and produced gondolas, nacelles, fly-by-wire power plant controls and empennages of NPO ‚ÄúRosAeroSystems‚Äù <b>airships</b> Au-30 and Au-12M.|$|R
