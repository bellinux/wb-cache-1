50|$|Mining {{can have}} {{adverse effects on}} {{surrounding}} surface and groundwater if protective measures are not taken. The result can be unnaturally high concentrations of some chemicals, such as arsenic, sulfuric acid, and mercury over a significant area of surface or subsurface. Runoff of mere soil or rock debris -although non-toxic- also devastates the surrounding vegetation. The dumping of the runoff in surface waters or in forests is the worst option here. Submarine tailings disposal {{is regarded as a}} better option (if the soil is pumped to a great depth). Mere land storage and refilling of the mine after it has been depleted is even better, if no forests need to be cleared for the storage of the debris. There is potential for massive contamination of the area surrounding mines due to the various chemicals used in the mining process as well as the potentially damaging compounds and metals removed from the ground with the ore. Large amounts of water produced from mine drainage, mine cooling, <b>aqueous</b> <b>extraction</b> and other mining processes increases the potential for these chemicals to contaminate ground and surface water. In well-regulated mines, hydrologists and geologists take careful measurements of water and soil to exclude any type of water contamination that could be caused by the mine's operations. The reducing or eliminating of environmental degradation is enforced in modern American mining by federal and state law, by restricting operators to meet standards for protecting surface and ground water from contamination. This is best done through the use of non-toxic extraction processes as bioleaching. If the project site becomes nonetheless polluted, mitigation techniques such as acid mine drainage (AMD) need to be performed.|$|E

For the <b>aqueous</b> <b>extraction</b> stage, the oil yield depended on the operating conditions including screw rotation speed, screw profile, and inlet flow rates of press cakes and water. Liquid/solid separation required the addition of a lignocellulosic residue (wheat straw), upstream from the filtration zone.

The higher mortality of D. speciosa adults as well as a smaller leaf consumption area were observed after treatments with increasing dosages of different C. rotundus extracts generated by alcoholic extraction (55 % of mortality and 28 % leaf consumption). Therefore, the alcoholic extract of the C. rotundus foliage is an option for the control of D. speciosa in agroecologic systems. The {{objective of}} this work was to evaluate the insecticidal effect or repellency of Cyperus rotundus, an important weed plant, through alternative methods of extraction, on Diabrotica speciosa, a pest that affects several plant species. The experimental design was completely casual, and consisted of five repetitions. The C. rotundus extracts were prepared using leaves and roots by alcoholic <b>extraction,</b> <b>aqueous</b> (hot water) <b>extraction</b> and <b>aqueous</b> (cold water) <b>extraction</b> and diluted to four different concentrations (0, 5, 10, and 15 % of the volume of each extract). These dilutions were then tested and compared with a control. The higher mortality of D. speciosa adults as well as a smaller leaf consumption area were observed after treatments with increasing dosages of different C. rotundus extracts generated by alcoholic extraction (55 % of mortality and 28 % leaf consumption). Therefore, the alcoholic extract of the C. rotundus foliage is an option for the control of D. speciosa in agroecologic systems...|$|R
40|$|<b>Aqueous</b> biphasic <b>extraction</b> (ABE) {{processes}} {{offer the}} potential for low-cost, highly selective separations. This countercurrent extraction technique involves selective partitioning of either dissolved solutes or ultrafine particulates between two immiscible <b>aqueous</b> phases. The <b>extraction</b> systems that the authors have studied are generated by combining an aqueous salt solution with an aqueous polymer solution. They have examined {{a wide range of}} applications for ABE, including the treatment of solid and liquid nuclear wastes, decontamination of soils, and processing of mineral ores. They have also conducted fundamental studies of solution microstructure using small angle neutron scattering (SANS). In this report they review the physicochemical fundamentals of aqueous biphase formation and discuss the development and scaleup of ABE processes for environmental remediation...|$|R

The processes comprise the use {{of one or more}} enzyme activities including phospholipase and protease activity. The processes are useful for improving the extraction of oil from oilseeds, as well as for obtaining more desirable proteins from those oilseeds...|$|R
