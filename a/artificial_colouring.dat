The author seldoms avails himself of any artificial ornaments [...] Though we feel ourselves compelled to make these observations, it is hardly necessary to add, that upon the whole we think very highly of this performance." [...] The review continues by comparing Madoc to Paradise Lost: [...] "were the style adorned by a little <b>artificial</b> <b>colouring,</b> and enriched with all the allowable decorations of poetry, Madoc would hardly yield to Paradise Lost. As it stands, it is certainly the second heroic production in the English language. Its leading characteristics are not fire and sublimity, but tenderness and humanity. Milton astonishes the head—Southey touches the heart. The first we may admire—the last we can love." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many modern absinthes are {{produced}} using a cold mix process. This inexpensive {{method of production}} does not involve distillation, and is regarded as inferior {{in the same way}} that cheaper compound gin is regarded as inferior to distilled gin. [...] The cold mixing process involves the simple blending of flavouring essences and <b>artificial</b> <b>colouring</b> in commercial alcohol, in similar fashion to most flavoured vodkas and inexpensive liqueurs and cordials. Some modern cold mixed absinthes have been bottled at strengths approaching 90% ABV. Others are presented simply as a bottle of plain alcohol with a small amount of powdered herbs suspended within it.|$|E

50|$|In 1986, Libby's {{removed all}} <b>artificial</b> <b>colouring,</b> {{sweeteners}} and preservatives from Um Bongo, {{replacing them with}} natural colouring. Citric acid was also taken out and replaced with lemon juice. Since 2011, citric acid has again been in use.|$|E
50|$|Any Dutch brandy is {{supposed}} to contain at least 35% of alcohol, and not more than 20 grammes of sugar per litre.

5000|$|The term painted fish {{refers to}} {{ornamental}} aquarium fish {{which have been}} artificially coloured to appeal to consumers. This <b>artificial</b> <b>colouring,</b> also known as juicing, is achieved {{by a number of}} methods, such as injecting the fish with a hypodermic syringe containing bright fluorescent colour dye, dipping the fish into a dye solution, or feeding the fish dyed food.|$|E
5000|$|The effervescence, {{when the}} powder dissolves {{as it is}} stirred into water, {{is due to the}} {{reaction}} of the citric and tartaric acids with sodium bicarbonate, forming carbon dioxide gas. These weak organic [...] "fruit" [...] acids also provide the sharp taste. The addition of stabiliser and saponaceaous foaming agent extends the life of the bubbles. The <b>artificial</b> <b>colouring</b> and flavouring, plus the fruit acids, give the illusion of a fruity base, although the recipe is essentially synthetic.|$|E
50|$|The {{contained}} beverage is a juice {{drink in}} a variety of fruity flavours - usually orange, raspberry, strawberry, or blackcurrant. Most brands contain no <b>artificial</b> <b>colours</b> or flavouring, are pasteurized, and are often sugar free.|$|R

5000|$|The {{technique}} {{relies on}} the fact that some black-and-white film recordings contain the original PAL colour sub-carrier recorded on each film frame as a pattern of fine [...] "chroma dots" [...] and the software is able to decode these back to colour. This process is completely different from the <b>artificial</b> <b>colouring</b> technique that was applied to some black-and-white films during the 1980s — with The Guardian describing the group's new descrambling process as [...] "akin to turning an omelette back into an egg".|$|E
50|$|Distilled absinthe {{employs a}} method of {{production}} {{similar to that of}} high quality gin. Botanicals are initially macerated in distilled base alcohol before being redistilled to exclude bitter principles, and impart the desired complexity and texture to the spirit.The distillation of absinthe first yields a colourless distillate that leaves the alembic at around 72% ABV.

50|$|Once {{the outline}} is complete, the artist {{may choose to}} {{illuminate}} it with colour, again using either wet or dry ingredients like paints, coloured rice-water, gypsum powder, coloured sand or dry pigments. The artist might also choose unprocessed materials like seeds, grains, spices, leaves or flower petals to achieve lifelike hues. Modern materials like crayons, dyes or dyed fabrics, acrylic paints and <b>artificial</b> <b>colouring</b> agents are also becoming common, allowing for brilliant and vibrant colour choices. A newer but less artificial method involves using cement coloured with marble powder. This rather precise method requires training, but beautiful portraits can be drawn in this medium.|$|E
5000|$|The latest 2009 {{modification}} mainly {{breaks down}} to an addition of <b>artificial</b> <b>colouring</b> and substances whose hypothetical function is either as detergents (i.e., cleaning substances) or stabilisers (i.e., product longevity enhancers). However, even the pre-2009 formula {{was a far cry}} from the original one. The latter was completely free of industrial cleaners, free of synthetic colours and (apparently) free of synthetic odorants, whose place was occupied by natural herbal fragrances. However, one unknown in the original formula is the [...] "Pears fragrance essence": because of it, the customer cannot be certain whether the [...] "new" [...] fragrant compounds are indeed all new—or simply formerly unlisted items.|$|E

5000|$|Yan Chim Kee (甄沾記) is a {{well known}} {{confectionery}} and foodstuffs manufacturer in Hong Kong with a history that dates back at least a century. Established in Guangzhou by Yan Lung Lap (甄倫立) in 1915, [...] its coconut candy is an acknowledged traditional classic. The packaging of Yan Chim Kee Coconut Candy were eyecatching shades of red, green and yellow with a distinctive logo. It is available in multiple flavors and textures to suit local preferences. The firm insists upon strict quality control and maintain that their products do not contain preservatives or <b>artificial</b> <b>colouring.</b> The only ingredients permitted were fresh coconut milk, liquid glucose and sugar. Typical price for the candy was only 5 cents back in the 1900s - [...] this was in fact quite a sum in the old days. The firm was considered a pillar in the local food manufacturing scene during the 1950s to the 1970s - older Hong Kong residents have fond memories of their coconut based candies, juices and ice cream products.|$|E
5000|$|Cassia tora {{has many}} uses. The whole plant {{as well as}} {{specific}} parts such as roots, leaves and seeds {{have been widely used}} in traditional Indian and South Asian medicine. The plant and seeds are edible. The edible part of the plant varies from 30 to 40 percent. Young leaves can be cooked as a vegetable while the roasted seeds are a good substitute for coffee. In Sri Lanka, its flowers are added to food. It is used as a natural pesticide in organic farms and its powder is most commonly used in the pet food industry. Alternatively, it is mixed with guar gum for use in mining and other industrial applications. The seeds and leaves are also used to treat skin disease and its seeds can be utilized as a laxative. This weed could also become a reliable cheap source of nutritious feed for the Grass Carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella. Cassia tora tea is a herbal, pure, natural and non-polluted green health beverage. In the Republic of Korea, it is believed to rejuvenate human vision. Additionally, the tea has created a new term “coffee-tea”, because of its mysterious but very rich taste and its coffee aroma. It is made from 100 percent Cassia tora, with no <b>artificial</b> <b>colouring</b> and no caffeine, and could be a healthier substitute for coffee and sodas. Since Cassia tora has an external germicide and antiparasitic character, it has been used for treating skin diseases such as leprosy, ringworm, itching and psoriasis and also for snakebites. Other medicinal provisions from plant parts include balm for arthritis using leaves of Cassia tora. Cassia tora is one of the recognized plants that contain the organic compound anthraquinone and is used in Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine. This herb is used in Ayurveda for treatment of swellings. Nutritional Information A natural gelling agent that has industrial and food benefits is made from the seed. The primary chemical constituents of the seed include cinnamaldehyde, gum, tannins, mannitol, coumarins and essential oils (aldehydes, eugenol and pinene). The seeds also contain sugars, resins and mucilage, among other elements.|$|E
40|$|Dielectric {{metamaterials}} {{are widely}} explored as low-loss alternative to their plasmonic counterparts, which suffer from substantial Ohmic losses at optical frequencies. Here we demonstrate that organometallic perovskites, emerging solution-processable materials with outstanding optoelectronic properties and high index of refraction, provide {{a platform for}} all-dielectric metamaterials operating at visible frequencies. We show organolead halide perovskite metasurfaces with structural colouring tunable across the visible spectrum through sub-wavelength structuring. Moreover, we demonstrate that nanostructured perovskite films exhibit enhanced photoluminescence. We observed a three-fold increase of the luminescence yield and comparable reduction of luminescence decay time in comparison with unstructured perovskites films. We argue that nanostructured, solution processable organometallic perovskites metamaterials prepared by nanoimprint could be a low cost solution for photovoltaic energy conversion, large-area light-emitting devices, and <b>artificial</b> <b>colouring</b> for display applications...|$|E
