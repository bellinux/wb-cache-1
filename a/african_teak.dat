40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the silvicultural performance of four forest species introduced in a setting for integrated livestock forest (ILF) in a pasture in Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The species included were the Australian red cedar (seminal and clonal), <b>African</b> mahogany, <b>teak,</b> and guanandi. A split plot scheme with a randomized complete block design comprising four replicates and 48 plants per plot, was used in the following arrangement: (3 (3 x 2) + 7 x 2) m. The evaluation times (12, 18, 31, 36, and 43 months after planting) corresponded to the subplots. Performances of all four species were evaluated on the basis of their survival rate, height (H) and diameter at breast height (DBH). Based on the performance of the species with regard to these parameters, the clonal Australian red cedar showed a greater growth in DBH and height in the ILF setting as compared to the other species, which indicates it to be a suitable species for the region of Lavras, MG as long as its survival control occurs in the implantation phase...|$|R

50|$|Pericopsis elata, the <b>African</b> <b>teak,</b> afromosia, or afrormosia, is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the legume family, Fabaceae, which is native to moist, semi-deciduous African forests. It is a tall tree that produces timber of high commercial value.|$|E
50|$|<b>African</b> <b>teak</b> {{is common}} {{over much of}} its wide range. When forests are felled, {{isolated}} trees are often left standing and the tree regenerates easily. Fresh seed germinates readily but it loses viability in storage. Some populations, especially plantations, are attacked by a gall mite.|$|E
50|$|Milicia excelsa (commonly {{known as}} <b>African</b> <b>teak,</b> mvule or iroko) is a tree species from {{tropical}} Africa. It {{is one of}} two tree species yielding timber known as iroko, the other being Milicia regia. It is threatened by habitat loss. The seed is mainly dispersed by bats.|$|E
50|$|Hardwoods include woods such as <b>African</b> <b>Teak</b> from Ghana and the Ivory Coast; {{domestic}} Ash, Basswood, Cherry, Red Oak, White Oak, Poplar, Cedar, Cypress, Chestnut, Walnut, and Willow; {{along with}} African Mahogany and Mahogany from both Honduras and the Philippines; plus African Walnut, Rosewood from Brazil, and Teak from Thailand.|$|E
50|$|Use of dugout canoes has {{declined}} somewhat except in more remote locations, {{due to a}} relative shortage of good <b>African</b> <b>Teak</b> trees, and competition from timber plank, aluminium and glass-fibre boats. The use of outboard motors remains relatively low due to {{the high cost of}} fuel and lack of maintenance services.|$|E
50|$|In West Africa, <b>African</b> <b>teak</b> is {{considered}} to be a sacred tree. It is often protected when the surrounding bush is cleared, ritual sacrifices take place underneath it and gifts are given to it. Fertility and birth are associated with it and its timber is used to make ceremonial drums and coffins.|$|E
50|$|Pterocarpus angolensis (<b>African</b> <b>teak,</b> wild teak, Kiaat, Morôtô, Mokwa, Mutondo, Mukwa, Mubvamaropa, Umvangazi) is {{a species}} of Pterocarpus native to {{southern}} Africa, in Angola, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zaire, Zimbabwe,and Zambia. It is a protected tree in South Africa. The name Kiaat, although Afrikaans, is sometimes used outside South Africa as well. In Zimbabwe, depending on what region you are in, it is known as Mukwa or Mubvamaropa.|$|E
50|$|<b>African</b> <b>teak</b> {{has strong}} dark brown hardwood, {{resistant}} to termites {{and is used}} for construction, furniture, joinery, panelling, floors and boats. The tree {{can be used in}} the control of erosion. It makes a good shade tree and is useful as a roadside tree in urban areas. It grows rapidly, can be coppiced and is ready for cutting after about fifty years. The tree is nitrogen fixing and the leaves are used for mulching.|$|E

50|$|Dioecious {{species have}} {{the male and}} female {{reproductive}} structures on separate plants.The meaning of male and female in the context of plants is different from that used in animal groups and the usage is not strictly correct. This issue is discussed below in the Alternation of generations section. About 6 percent of angiosperm species are entirely dioecious and about 7% of angiosperm genera contain some dioecious species. Examples of dioecious plant species include ginkgos, willows, cannabis and <b>African</b> <b>teak.</b> More examples of dioecious plants {{can be found in the}} Wikipedia category, Dioecious plants.|$|E
50|$|The straw-coloured {{fruit bat}} {{is a highly}} social species. The bats tend to live in groups of over 100,000 and at times that number may {{increase}} to almost one million. At night the bats leave the roost in smaller groups to find food by sight and smell. They have also been seen chewing on soft wood for moisture. These bats can also pollinate flowers and disperse seeds through the forests. They are the main agents of seed dispersal for the increasingly rare and economically significant <b>African</b> <b>teak</b> tree Milicia excelsa.|$|E
50|$|<b>African</b> <b>teak</b> is {{distributed}} across tropical central Africa. Its range extends from Guinea-Bissau {{in the west}} to Mozambique in the east. It is found in Angola, Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda and Zimbabwe. Its natural habitat is in wet savannah, rainforest, riverine and low-altitude evergreen forests. It can tolerate an annual rainfall of less than 70 cm or six months of drought {{as long as there is}} a stream or a ground water source nearby.|$|E
50|$|The {{techniques}} of making temporary boats or rafts by weaving together bundles of buoyant reeds {{were known to}} African people living near the many rivers, lakes, lagoons and swamps {{of what is now}} Zambia. The coming of the Iron Age introduced tools such as the adze which facilitates the construction of dugout canoes, especially from <b>African</b> <b>teak</b> (Pterocarpus angolensis or 'mulombwa' in Chibemba, 'mulombe' in Chilozi, 'mukwa' in Chishona) which has a long life even when constantly immersed. The dugout then took over as the principal means of fishing and travel by boat, whether paddled in deeper water, or punted in shallow water like makoros in neighbouring Botswana.|$|E

SOTEXKI, the Textile Society of Kisangani produces fabrics and manufactures clothing, while Bralima produces beverages, REGIDESO treats and supplies water to the population, SORGERIE (Société de Gestion, de Gérance et d'Investissement), produces soaps, vegetable oils and other cosmetic products. Compagnie Forestière de Transformation (CFT) is the firm that process and exports <b>African</b> <b>teak.</b> Pharmaceuticals, printed material, food processing, telecommunications, textile and clothing manufacturing, tobacco and transportation, also play major roles in the city's economy. The service sector is strong and includes civil, mechanical and process engineering, finance, higher education, and also research and development.|$|E
50|$|MacCormac {{first arrived}} in West Africa {{by the age of}} {{eighteen}} and originally settled in the Gold Coast. MacCormac settled permanently in Sierra Leone in 1814 and by 1816 he introduced the timber trade to Sierra Leone by shipping a type of timber called <b>African</b> <b>Teak,</b> which was really African Oak, from the estuary of the Rokel River to England. He built himself a home and a timber yard on Timbo Island. He contracted a workforce of Temne labourers as well as Black colonists from the Sierra Leone some of whom also acted as overseers of the timber production process. He also built a large stone house in the Sierra Leone hinterland and a spacious mansion worth £10,000 on the corner of Rawdon and Oxford Streets.|$|E
5000|$|The Congo {{forest is}} an {{important}} biodiversity hotspot. It is home to okapi, bonobo and the Congo peafowl, but {{is also an important}} source of <b>African</b> <b>teak,</b> used for building furniture and flooring. An estimated 40 million people depend on these woodlands, surviving on traditional livelihoods. At a global level, Congo's forests act as the planet's second lung, counterpart to the rapidly dwindling Amazon. They are a huge [...] "carbon sink," [...] trapping carbon that could otherwise become carbon dioxide, the main cause of global warming. The Congo Basin holds roughly 8 percent of the world's forest-based carbon. These forests also affect rainfall across the North Atlantic. In other words, these distant forests are crucial to the future of climate stability, a bulwark against runaway climate change.|$|E
50|$|The Dufuna canoe from Nigeria is an 8000-year-old dugout, {{the oldest}} boat {{discovered}} in Africa, and the third-oldest worldwide.The well-watered tropical rainforest and woodland regions of sub-Saharan Africa provide both the waterways {{and the trees}} for dugout canoes, which are commonplace from the Limpopo River basin in the south through East and Central Africa and across to West Africa. <b>African</b> <b>Teak</b> is the timber favoured for their construction, though this comprises {{a number of different}} species, and is in short supply in some areas. Dugouts are paddled across deep lakes and rivers or punted through channels in swamps (see makoro) or in shallow areas, and are used for transport, fishing and hunting, including, in the past, the very dangerous hunting of hippopotamus. Dugouts are called pirogues in Francophone areas of Africa.|$|E
5000|$|Spence’s {{design for}} St Paul’s is quite simple {{although}} this is not obvious at first glance. The church is basically two brick walls joined by a shallow barrel vault roof strengthened by diagonal steel bracing. The ends of the church consist almost entirely of glass with Spence integrating some the ideas he had used at St Oswald’s, Tile Hill in 1957. To {{the front of the}} church is a 15 metre high campanile consisting of just two brick walls with concrete ties in between. There is a six-metre cross on top of the campanile. The church hall stands just to the north within the church grounds. The interior has a balcony reached by steps on which the organ stands. While the altar is screened to give it some privacy from the big end window by a hardwood panel made from <b>African</b> <b>Teak</b> [...] Spence’s personal gift for the church were the altar ornaments which are made from hammered iron.|$|E
50|$|<b>African</b> <b>teak</b> {{is a large}} {{deciduous}} tree {{growing up}} to 50 m high. The trunk is bare lower down with the first branch usually at least 20 m above the ground. It often has several short buttress roots at the base. The bark is pale or dark grey, thick but little fissured, and if it gets damaged it oozes milky latex. There are a few thick branches in the crown all fairly horizontal giving an umbrella shape. The smaller branches hang down in female trees and curve up in male trees. The leaves are 5 to 10 cm long, ovate or elliptical with a finely toothed edge, green and smooth above and slightly downy beneath. Older leaves turn yellow, {{and all of the}} leaves have a prominent rectangular mesh of veins visible on the underside. The trees are dioecious. Male trees have white catkins that extend 15 to 20 cm and dangle from twigs at the axils of the leaves. Female trees have flower spikes measuring 5 to 6 cm long by 2 cm wide, green with prominent styles. The fruit are long, wrinkled and fleshy with the small seeds embedded in the pulp.|$|E
5000|$|Iroko {{is a large}} {{hardwood}} tree from {{the west coast of}} tropical Africa that can live up to 500 years. [...] The tree is known to the Yoruba as ìrókò, logo or loko and is believed to have supernatural properties. [...] Iroko is known to the Igbo people as oji wood. [...] It is one of the woods sometimes referred to as <b>African</b> <b>teak,</b> although it is unrelated to the teak family. The wood colour is initially yellow but darkens to a richer reddish brown over time.It is yielded mostly (probably) by Milicia excelsa. In much of the literature on this timber the names of the trees that yields it are given as Chlorophora excelsa and Chlorophora regia.The tree is feared in some cultures where it originates and hence is shunned or revered with offerings. Yoruba people believe that the tree is inhabited by a spirit, and anybody who sees the Iroko-man face to face becomes insane and speedily dies. According to the Yoruba, any man who cuts down any Iroko tree causes devastating misfortune on himself and all of his family, although if they need to cut down the tree they can make a prayer afterwards to protect themselves. [...] They also claim that the spirit of the Iroko can be heard in houses which use Iroko wood, as the spirit of the Iroko is trapped in the wood. In Nigeria the iroko wood is of much lower quality due to soil conditions as well as root-rot. [...] Some Westerners refer to the wood as [...] "poor man's teak".|$|E
5000|$|Carpenter house, built 1890, {{extensively}} renovated in the 1920s, is {{a colonial}} revival with two and one half stories. It has six bedrooms with a formal front staircase {{on the west}} made of quarter-sawn oak and rectilinear panels with square stair spokes. The library has oak built in bookcases, wall panels and dentil cove molding all of quarter-sawn oak. The living room is 17 feet by 33 feet with an oak colonial revival fireplace on the north. The fireplace has matte green Grueby like three inch square tiles. The ceiling of the great room or living room is molded plaster tiles identical to {{the ceiling of the}} historic Hoyt Sherman House. [...] Florence Carpenter, a member of the Des Moines Women's club, was on the Hoyt-Sherman building committee in 1923 when the club auditorium was first dedicated. [...] The formal dining room also has wood wall panels and cove molding all of <b>African</b> <b>Teak</b> wood. A servant's call button was present {{in the middle of the}} dining room but has since been covered by a brass plate. There is a servant's staircase on the east. After a fire nearly claimed the Carpenters' collection in the 1920s, a fireproof art room was constructed on the North. The room is separated from the house by about three feet of concrete and a double bank vault door. The 17 by 13 foot art room with 11 foot ceilings has 10 inch concrete floors and ceiling. Two windows on the North had bars that were removed at an unknown date, after the carpenter occupation. On humid days, with a strong Northeast wind, the smell of charred wood is present in the second story. The estate was 13 acres during the Carpenter period. [...] The original address of Summit street was changed to 1525 East 33rd street and again changed by development to 3320 Kinsey Avenue. The property was placed on the National Historic Register in 1998 and declared a local Des Moines Landmark by the Des Moines City Council ordinance 2001.|$|E
