Does the child <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> the changes in their {{environment}} easily, or is the child resistant? A child who adjusts easily may be quick to settle into a new routine, whereas a resistant child may take a long time <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> the situation.|$|R

5|$|Kickers {{experience}} further disadvantages when attempting {{field goals}} at CenturyLink Field. Both the stadium's proximity to Puget Sound {{and the open}} north end create winds that are challenging to gauge.

5|$|Regarding the {{significant}} increases detected, {{it is worthwhile}} to consider {{that the number of}} pharmaceuticals dispensed for legitimate therapeutic uses may be increasing over time, and DAWN estimates are not <b>adjusted</b> <b>to</b> take such increases into account.

50|$|Although {{motion and}} images are {{extremely}} important regarding adaptation, {{the most important}} adaptation is <b>adjusting</b> <b>to</b> brightness levels. When one goes into a dark room, {{it takes a while}} <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> the darkness and much is the same when one goes from a dark room to a very bright setting. <b>Adjusting</b> <b>to</b> brightness levels allows mammals to detect changes in their surrounding.

5|$|Also in {{the early}} 1960s, the carrier {{provided}} some initial aviation support to the Ethiopia-United States Mapping Mission in its operation to acquire topographic maps of Ethiopia. The firm changed from a corporation to a share company in 1965, and changed its name from Ethiopian Air Lines to Ethiopian Airlines. By 1966, the contractual relationship with TWA was <b>adjusted</b> <b>to</b> reflect the transfer of management with the appointment of an Ethiopian deputy general manager. Two Boeing 720s were in operation and a Boeing 707-320C was due to be phased in by , when the carrier ordered a second -320C.|$|E
5|$|Commissioned by Queen Victoria in 1858, Garrard & Co. made a set {{of three}} large bow {{brooches}} containing more than 506 diamonds. There is no record of Queen Victoria ever wearing them; Queen Alexandra, Queen Mary, the Queen Mother and Elizabeth were seen wearing them frequently. The brooches are often <b>adjusted</b> <b>to</b> contain a large pearl or emerald diamond drop. Queen Mary was pictured {{on more than one}} occasion with the smaller Cullinan diamonds as the drops.|$|E
5|$|Durran's costumes {{also helped}} emphasise social {{rank among the}} {{different}} characters; Caroline Bingley for instance is introduced in an empire silhouetted dress, clothing that would have then been {{at the height of}} fashion. During her interview, Durran opined that all the women wear white at the Netherfield Ball due to its contemporary popularity, an idea that Wright credits as his reason for hiring her. All of the costumes were handmade, as clothing was at the time. However, costumes and hairstyles were <b>adjusted</b> <b>to</b> appeal to contemporary audiences, sacrificing historical accuracy.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes the {{suggestion}} is, that a price category fully replaces a value category, {{at other times}} both categories always co-exist, and require each other, so that production prices can <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> product-values but product-values can also <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> production prices.|$|R
50|$|The first {{subsystem}} {{is sensitive}} to green light, one of the colours in the visible spectrum. This sensitivity helps the backswimmer see in dimmer light or at night. The second subsystem allows the backswimmer to see in bright light and when in flight. Notonecta glauca pupil (acone) take a different amount of time <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> light. It takes the N. glauca approximately 40 minutes for the pupil <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> daylight and approximately 50 minutes <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>to</b> the light at night.|$|R

5|$|In 1964 the {{guidelines}} were changed to allow individual conventions to create additional categories, which was codified as {{up to two}} categories for that year. These additional awards were officially designated as Hugo Awards, but {{were not required to}} be repeated by future conventions. This was later <b>adjusted</b> <b>to</b> only allow one additional category; while these extra Hugo Awards have been given out in several categories, only a few were ever awarded for more than one year.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} during Amenhotep I's reign the first water clock was invented. Amenhotep's court {{astronomer}} Amenemheb took credit for creating this device in his tomb biography, although the oldest surviving mechanism {{dates to the}} reign of Amenhotep III. This invention was of great benefit for timekeeping, because the Egyptian hour was not a fixed amount of time, but was measured as 1/12 of the night. When the nights were shorter in the summer, these waterclocks could be <b>adjusted</b> <b>to</b> measure the shorter hours accurately.|$|E
5|$|Large {{sections}} of the game feature a car which resembles a gutted-and-rebuilt 1969 Dodge Charger. It {{appears to have been}} tuned for performance. A radar system is installed later in the game, allowing the player to locate Rebel supply caches. In the final battle, a rear-mounted storage rack for Magnusson Devices is added and the radar is <b>adjusted</b> <b>to</b> track enemies and Magnusson Device dispensers. A homing unit is also installed so the player can quickly locate the car in the chaos of the final battle via a readout in the Hazardous Environment suit.|$|E

5|$|M-70 {{was a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan. In the 1920s, the highway originally connected Sterling in southwest Arenac County with Prescott in southeast Ogemaw County. The route was later <b>adjusted</b> <b>to</b> run from M-76 near Sterling along a convoluted route through Maple Ridge and Prescott to end at M-55 in Nester's Corners. The highway was still a gravel road when the designation was removed by 1960.|$|E
5|$|Magic, {{like many}} other games, {{combines}} chance and skill. One frequent complaint about the game involves {{the notion that there}} is too much luck involved, especially concerning possessing too many or too few lands. Early in the game especially, too many or too few lands could ruin a player's chance at victory without the player having made a mistake. This in-game statistical variance can be minimized by proper deck construction, as an appropriate land count can reduce mana problems. In Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012, the land count is automatically <b>adjusted</b> <b>to</b> 40% of the total deck size.|$|E
5|$|Moving {{from the}} PlayStation Portable to the PlayStation 3 allowed the {{development}} team {{to add more}} details to the character designs, additional atmospheric sounds, as well as slightly tweak the gameplay system, now allowing camera control with the right analog stick. In addition, the Mirage Arena (a multiplayer component from the original game) has been reworked to only be a single-player experience. Yasue said enemy strengths and AI in the arena were <b>adjusted</b> <b>to</b> account for this. The inclusion of the Final Mix version in the collection {{marked the first time}} for this version to be released outside Japan.|$|E

The old genus Dendroica was then deleted. Within the genus, it appears to have no particularly close relatives.|$|E
