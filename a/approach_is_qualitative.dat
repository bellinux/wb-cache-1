As a result we present a categorization of the service co-development interventions’ effects. Our findings indicate that the effects occur on two levels: thinking and practice. Furthermore, we argue that especially the use of visual boundary objects is crucial for the effectiveness of the interventions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} the vision for public participation in water resources management embedded in Kenya's 2002 Water Act, as it relates to pastoralists. The Act envisions that responsibility for management of water resources at the local level will be devolved to community-level bodies. Our <b>approach</b> <b>was</b> <b>qualitative</b> and included interviews with government officials and Gabra pastoralists, observation of and participation in traditional Gabra korra meetings and focus group discussions. We conclude that the 'institutional model' of participation being pursued through the creation of Water Resource User Associations is particularly problematic for mobile pastoralists such as the Gabra, and we suggest an alternative strategy that would focus on the fostering of deliberation processes.
