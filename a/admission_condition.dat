40|$|The {{current study}} investigates {{the sources of}} loss inside a mixed flow, double entry {{turbocharger}} turbine under steady inlet conditions in both full and partial admission. Under normal on-engine operation, {{it is likely that}} both limbs in adouble entry device will be fed by exhaust pulsations which are out of phase meaning that the turbine will spend most or all of the time with unbalanced flow through each limb. In the extreme case one limb will be flowing whilst the other is stagnant, this is the partial <b>admission</b> <b>condition.</b> Even under steady state inlet conditions, unequal admission is an important effect to study on the way to fully understanding pulsed operation of adouble entry device. This paper presents 3 D computational analyses of the flow inside adouble entry turbine under both full and partial admission. The computational results are compared to experimental results of Copeland (2009) and Copeland et al. (2010). The distribution of loss within the turbine is evaluated for each computational condition by means of entropy production. In the full admission case the most significant area of loss was found to be in the tip region. Under the partial <b>admission</b> <b>condition</b> the flow regime is very different. In this case the rotor wheel was found to be acting in a fully unsteady manner, with the flow being unable to reach a fully developed state throughout the flowing section of the volute. The most significant area of entropy generation in the partial admission case was associated with interaction of the flows in each sector of the volute, this occurred in the interspace between the nozzle exit and the rotor passage inlet...|$|E

The admission control and bandwidth allocation are devised from the optimal solution of maximizing aggregate social welfare of the network. We define a utility function to capture network user’s demand for guaranteed bandwidth requirements with a price charged by a network service provider {{at the edge of}} the network. A fairness criterion is introduced for network links to allocate bandwidths. We first consider global <b>admission</b> <b>conditions,</b> which are deduced from the social welfare maximization problem, and then present distributed <b>admission</b> <b>conditions,</b> which can be used by each network link to make admission decisions locally. The bandwidth allocation resulted from the distributed <b>admission</b> <b>conditions</b> is asymptotically optimal with respect to the bandwidth allocation resulted from the global <b>admission</b> <b>conditions.</b> We show that the admission control framework can provide guidance for network service providers to charge users that require guaranteed bandwidths for data transmissions. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper gives {{a summary}} of the DMI and EDFI {{real-time}} scheduling algorithms, first presented by P. G. Jansen. During this discussion a number of imperfections in the existing theory are corrected. Several additions to the existing theory are presented as well, including a dynamic task <b>admission</b> <b>condition,</b> support for non-preemptable nested critical sections and multi-use resources. Both the DMI and EDFI schedulers together with their accompanying admission control mechanisms have been implemented in the RT-Linux operating system. The DMI and EDFI scheduler organisation has been adapted to work within the existing RT-Linux scheduler framework. Special care has been taken during the implementation of the schedulers to keep their worst case overhead behavior as low possible. The implementation has been verified for its correctness using several tools that we developed. A variety of tests have been executed to get an indication of the scheduler performance under various conditions. Results show that the scheduling overhead is relatively low, less than one percent for a task set that could arguably resemble a real-life situation. i Samenvattin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – In this paper, the {{performance}} of the twin-entry radial flow turbine under steady state and partial admission conditions is modeled. The method, which is developed here, is based on one-dimensional performance prediction. In one-dimensional modeling, the flow properties are assumed constant on a plane normal to the flow direction. This assumption is in contrast with the flow at the rotor entry of a twin-entry turbine under partial <b>admission</b> <b>condition.</b> In this study the one-dimensional performance prediction method for a single-entry turbine is modified to analyze the twin-entry turbine. In particular, the loss coefficients due to friction, clearance and blade loading, which are already developed for single-entry turbines, are modified. Also, additional losses in the rotor are considered because of twin-entry rotor inlet conditions and the rotor-mixing losses. Indeed, in a single-entry turbine with symmetric volute, the flow tends to move toward the shroud. A correlation for the radial velocity profile at the rotor entry for this case is obtained and is considered to be optimum. Then the rotor mixing loss is estimated. Finally a model based on the above mentioned matters is developed. The results obtained from the model are compared with the experimental results and good agreements are obtained. In this paper, special behaviors of the flow in the twin-entry turbine are also investigated and some physical interpretations are presented...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{overview}} of the Canadian provincial regulations and the accreditation process of foreign trained lawyers and Québec lawyers performed by the National Committee on Accreditation. The procedure to transform a law graduate into a lawyer is examined for each province in terms of general <b>admission</b> <b>conditions,</b> such as education, articling and bar admission course, and special <b>admission</b> <b>conditions,</b> such as minimum age required and Canadian citizenship or permanent residence. Further, there are problems with the Canadian accreditation system that could be remedied with minor modifications and a more cooperative approach. To become a lawyer in Canada, one must be admitted {{as a member of the}} law society where she or he intends to practice. A foreign trained lawyer or a lawyer who achieved her or his civil law degree in Québec must be accredited by the National Committee on Accreditation administered by the Federation of the Law Societies of Canada from Ottawa before applying to any of the commonlaw society admission programs. Therefore, this paper presents a critical analysis of the provincial differences in terms of how new members are admitted in the law societies and analyses side effects of maintaining disunified provincial regulations across Canada. Despite differences, all law societies are focused on teaching law graduates how to apply their theoretical knowledge and practice law with professionalism and responsibility. This paper reveals how a disunified system of regulations is inequitable and unjust. Finally, this paper offers recommendations to improve the process of recruiting new lawyers, presents concrete ways to improve the accreditation process of foreign trained lawyers, and suggests a more equitable process of accreditation for lawyers who have obtained a civil law degree in Québec and intend to practice in a common-law jurisdiction. Ideas are presented that will enhance a more cooperative partnership between members of the National Committee on Accreditation, Canadian law societies, and law schools.

40|$|Objective: {{to improve}} {{pregnancy}} outcomes in severe gestosis. Subjects and methods: Sixty-five women with incomplete pregnancy in presence of severe gestosis were examined {{and the status}} of 65 neonatal babies was evaluated in the early neonatal period. The women were allocated into 3 groups: 1) 19 pregnant women were urgently operated on for severe <b>admission</b> <b>condition</b> (preeclampsia); 2) 22 pregnant women received standard therapy for gestosis; 3) 24 had standard therapy for gestosis in combination with 6 % solution of the hydroxyethyl starch Stabisol®. Results. During gestosis therapy, pregnancy prolongation was 4. 5 ± 1. 2 bed/days in Group 2 and averaged 7. 6 ± 1. 6 bed/days in Group 3. The rate of neonatal referral to an intensive care unit was 63. 1, 50. 0, and 37. 5 % in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

30|$|The {{main reason}} for using CAC is to {{guarantee}} QoS parameters such as signal quality, call dropping probability (DP), packet-level parameters, and transmission rate [27]. In an 802.11 WLAN, APs are incapable of maintaining signal quality due to the movement of MNs and various interferences. Furthermore, WiFi is a contention-oriented wireless access technology. Thus, to guarantee packet-level parameters and transmission rate is almost impossible for current APs. Consequently, call DP is the only QoS parameter that could be regulated by current APs. Since users perceive dropping an ongoing call as more disruptive than blocking a new call, CAC is employed to reduce the handoff call DP. CAC could be implemented by reserving resources for handoff calls. The admission criterion can be the user count, resource availability, or an estimated DP. Whatever the admission criterion, handoff calls receive less stringent <b>admission</b> <b>conditions</b> than does a new call, which might increase new call blocking probability (BP). The following subsections investigate three current CAC policies [28]: guard channel policy (GCP), fractional guard channel policy (FGCP), and limited fractional guard channel policy (LFGCP).|$|R

40|$|Most {{boosting}} {{systems in}} internal combustion engines utilize `pulse turbocharging' {{to maximize the}} energy extraction by the turbine. An internal combustion engine with more than four cylinders has a significant overlap between the exhaust pulses which, unless isolated, can decrease the overall pulse energy and increase the engine pumping loss. Thus, it is advantageous to isolate a set of cylinders and introduce the exhaust gases into two or more turbine entries separately. There are two main types of multiple entry turbines depending on the method of flow division: the twin-entry and the double-entry turbine. In the twin-entry design, each inlet feeds the entire circumference of the rotor leading edge regardless of inlet conditions. In contrast, the double-entry design introduces the flow from each gas inlet into the rotor leading edge through two distinct sectors of the nozzle.

When the fluid mass flow is low, the impulse kind {{of one or two}} stages supersonic turbine is employed. To prevent losses due to low blade aspect ratio and issues related to manufacturing and industrial problems, the turbine is used in partial <b>admission</b> <b>conditions.</b> Studies show that the turbine efficiency is highly dependent on the amount of partial admission coefficient. The turbine efficiency in full admission is high, but the use of partial admission lowers the additional losses. Therefore, there will be a degree of partial admission in which the turbine will have the highest efficiency. The aim of this work is to achieve the optimum partial admission for a special impulse turbine as a case study. Therefore, in the beginning, an appropriate model of losses is presented. Then, using a nonlinear design optimization code, the partial admission of an impulse supersonic turbine is optimized. This code is written using a genetic algorithm. Then, using three-dimensional numerical analysis, the optimal model will be selected. In the optimization problem, the turbine efficiency is the objective function.
