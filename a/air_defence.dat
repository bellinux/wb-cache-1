5|$|The Luftwaffes <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> {{organisation}} {{went through}} a number of changes in the first months of the war. The defence of the northern German ports and vital strategic targets was given to the local or nearest Luftverteidigungskommando (<b>Air</b> <b>Defence</b> Command). In this case the unit responsible for the protection of German warships of the Kriegsmarine was the Luftverteidigungskommando Hamburg (<b>Air</b> <b>Defence</b> Command Hamburg).|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} in which the air strikes were conducted, a force of 25 Wildcat and Supermarine Seafire fighters from 801, 842 and 880 Naval Air Squadrons {{provided}} <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> for the Home Fleet. Nine Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers, which were also operated by 842 Naval Air Squadron, conducted anti-submarine patrols. No threat to the fleet developed, and Corsairs took over <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> duties {{at the conclusion of the}} two attacks.|$|E
5|$|In this time, the Swiss Air Force {{also tested}} a few from the Swiss industry-developed Ground to <b>Air</b> <b>Defence</b> Systems but didn't {{introduce}} {{any of them}} into service (see: 35 mm anti aircraft tank B22L, RSD 58 and RSE Kriens (Missile)). Also a Mobile Ground to <b>Air</b> <b>Defence</b> System based on the Swiss wheeled APC Mowag Shark equipped with the French Crotale (missile) was not bought for the Swiss Air Force.|$|E

5|$|In May 1982, three Phantoms from 29 Squadron were forward {{deployed}} to RAF Wideawake on Ascension Island to provide air {{cover for the}} RAF's operations during the Falklands War, replacing Harriers of 1 Squadron, which were transiting to the war zone. In August 1982, {{following the end of}} the conflict and the reconstruction of the runway, 29 Squadron detached a number of its aircraft to RAF Stanley to provide <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> for the Falkland Islands. Late the following year, 23 Squadron took up the role, remaining stationed there until October 1988, when they were replaced by 1435 Flight. To make up for the loss of an entire squadron from the UK <b>Air</b> <b>Defence</b> Region, the RAF procured 15 second-hand F-4J Phantoms that had previously been used by the US Navy. These aircraft were operated by 74 Squadron from 1984 until 1991, when they were replaced by FGR.2 Phantoms that had been released by other squadrons following their conversion to the Tornado. Initially, it was intended that Phantoms and Tornados serve alongside each other. A total of 152 Tornado F.3s were ordered for the RAF, enough to convert four squadrons of Phantoms and two of Lightnings, but insufficient to completely convert every <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> squadron. Both 23 and 29 Squadrons converted from the Phantom FGR.2 to the Tornado between 1987 and 1988, alongside the conversion of the final two remaining Lightning squadrons. The intention was to retain a pair of UK based Phantom squadrons at RAF Wattisham, alongside a pair of Tornado units at RAF Coningsby to provide <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> cover for the southern half of the UK <b>Air</b> <b>Defence</b> Region. Another two squadrons stationed in Germany would also be retained. The end of the Cold War however led to a more rapid withdrawal of Phantom units than had originally been planned; under the Options for Change defence review the Phantom was to be withdrawn from service, with the two Germany based units disbanded as part of the gradual run down of the RAF's presence, and a {{reduction in the number of}} <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> squadrons leading to the two UK based units being disbanded in late 1992. However, just prior to the final withdrawal of the Phantom, it was recalled operationally as a result of Operation Granby, the UK's participation in the First Gulf War, when a total of six aircraft from 19 and 92 Squadrons were forward {{deployed to}} provide <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> cover at RAF Akrotiri; this was to replace the Tornados that had been originally deployed there on exercise, and were subsequently sent to the Gulf region. Following their final withdrawal from service, with a few exceptions, the bulk of the RAF's FGR.2 fleet was scrapped. Over its service life, 37 FGR.2s were lost to crashes.|$|E
5|$|On 20 December 1961, No.410 Squadron became Canada's first {{operational}} CF-101 Voodoo squadron. The Voodoo was an all-weather interceptor aircraft; {{its primary}} armament was the nuclear-tipped AIR-2A Genie unguided air-to-air rockets, {{and was used}} as Canada's primary means of <b>air</b> <b>defence.</b>|$|E

50|$|Finally, an {{accelerated}} timetable caused coordination issues. The Third Infantry Division moved ahead of schedule, causing {{the mission to}} be pushed up 24 hours. Suppression of enemy <b>air</b> <b>defences</b> occurred to the accelerated schedule even though the Apaches were not yet ready. The Apaches arrived only after a three-hour delay; the fighter-bombers had left the area by then and the helicopters were without support. The three-hour interval allowed Iraqi <b>air</b> <b>defences</b> to recover.|$|R
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{became a}} fighter unit in 1948, flying the de Havilland Vampire, having already flown the aircraft {{for two years}} in an <b>Air</b> <b>Defence</b> role.|$|E
5|$|The {{system was}} impractical. The Hamburg <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> {{district}} controlled both air and ground defences, but each was geographically {{in no position}} to help the other. There was no combined arms synthesis, meaning that the FlaK arm did not directly support the German defences thereby forming one mass defence. Instead, fighter units protecting the coast were held there, with Kriegsmarine FlaK units, while the Hamburg <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> artillery was held too far inland. The Luftwaffe fighters and FlaK units were located too far apart to coordinate.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{there was}} a {{worldwide}} disbandment of British forts as advances in <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> systems caused them to become obsolete. Today, the ruins of coastal fortifications are still visible at Labrador Battery, Mount Faber, Fort Siloso and Fort Canning that serve as a lasting reminder of their wartime legacy in Fortress Singapore.|$|E

5|$|Australian aircrew {{supported}} the fighting on 6 June. No.453 Squadron {{was one of}} 36 Allied squadrons that provided low-altitude <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> for the invasion fleet and landing force. Many of the squadron's pilots flew several sorties during the day, though they did not encounter any German aircraft. No.456 Squadron also formed part of the force that provided <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> for the invasion area at night. In addition, about 200 Australian pilots were spread across the dozens of RAF fighter and fighter-bomber units that {{supported the}} landings. A small number of Australian aircrew also served in RAF reconnaissance units and 2TAF's light bomber squadrons, which also saw combat over France on D-Day. The three Australian squadrons assigned to Coastal Command flew {{only a small number}} of sorties on 6 June as few German submarines or E-boats put to sea.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker had {{approved}} plans {{to join the}} United States in {{what became known as}} NORAD, an integrated <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> system, in mid-1957.

5|$|During the Suez Crisis of 1956, Hunters of No. 1 and No. 34 Squadrons {{based at}} RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus flew escort for English Electric Canberra bombers on {{offensive}} missions into Egypt.

5|$|Fighter pilots {{received}} no instrument training until very {{late in the}} war, after the training course had already been curtailed because of fuel shortages {{and the need to}} produce pilots more quickly to replace losses. Galland also did not make sure all-weather flying was incorporated into pilot training, which was of decisive importance in an effective <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> force.|$|E

5|$|If {{most of the}} Sea Harriers {{had been}} lost, the GR.3s would have {{replaced}} them in air patrol duties, even though the Harrier GR.3 was not designed for <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> operations; as such the GR.3s quickly had their outboard weapons pylons modified to take air-to-air Sidewinder missiles. From 10 to 24 May 1982, prior to British forces landing in the Falklands, a detachment of three GR.3s provided <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> for Ascension Island until three F-4 Phantom IIs arrived {{to take on this}} responsibility. During the Falklands War, the greatest threats to the Harriers were deemed to be surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and small arms fire from the ground. In total, four Harrier GR.3s and six Sea Harriers were lost to ground fire, accidents, or mechanical failure. More than 2,000 Harrier sorties were conducted during the conflict—equivalent to six sorties per day per aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three years the Combined Bomber Offensive had forced the Luftwaffe to invest heavily in <b>air</b> <b>defence.</b> In the {{campaign}} against the RAF, the German <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> system, named the Kammhuber Line, had become increasingly sophisticated. In 1942 the introduction of Lichtenstein radar, despite its early teething difficulties, and greater improvements in the armament and capability of German night fighters produced a force capable of inflicting heavy losses on British bomber streams. Though British losses rarely reached more than ten percent of a raid—considered a minimum target to irreparably damage British combat power—the night fighter force grew in size and potency. British losses in the Battle of the Ruhr (March–July 1943) and most notably in the Battle of Berlin (November 1943 – March 1944) reached an all-time high; 569 bombers in the latter campaign.|$|E
5|$|RAAF Hornets {{have also}} {{provided}} <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> for several high-profile events in Australia since the 11 September attacks. In 2002, Hornets patrolled over the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) at Coolum Beach, Queensland; {{this was the}} first time RAAF aircraft had flown <b>air</b> <b>defence</b> sorties over Australia since World War II. On 22 and 23 October that year a detachment of Hornets patrolled over Canberra during US President George W. Bush's visit to the city. A detachment of aircraft from No.77 Squadron was deployed to RAAF Base East Sale in March 2006 to protect the Commonwealth Games, which were being held in Melbourne. In September 2007, Hornets patrolled over Sydney during the APEC leaders meeting there. Eight Hornets were also deployed from Williamstown to RAAF Base Pearce in October 2011 to protect the CHOGM meeting in nearby Perth. On 16 and 17 November that year, Hornets operated over Canberra and Darwin while President Barack Obama was present.|$|E
