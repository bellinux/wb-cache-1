Wesley helps to release one man wounded under a heavy pipe, and tries to coax the other man to leave the burning room, but the man refuses. Wesley is forced to leave the scared man inside and drags the other man to safety. Outside the room, he soon realizes this was the psychological test. Eventually, the cadets are told of the results, and Mordock is granted admission into Starfleet Academy, while Wesley is encouraged to try <b>again</b> <b>next</b> <b>year.</b> Mordock thanks Wesley for his help and wishes him future success. After Wesley returns to the Enterprise, Picard confides in him that he also failed the examination the first time.|$|E

500|$|After {{returning}} from Moncton, Schmirler felt physically well, but suffered a setback when a CAT scan revealed spots around her lungs. The {{decision was made}} not to proceed with further chemotherapy, but she continued with the orthomolecular therapy. She {{had been scheduled to}} work the 2000 Scott Tournament of Hearts, but was unable to do so. She faxed a statement from the hospital, which was read by TSN's Vic Rauter. [...] "I'm still fighting hard and I still hope {{to make it to the}} Brier, not playing but talking. For Saskatchewan, I was hoping to be in your green shoes (at the Scott). But keep things in perspective. There are other things in life besides curling, which I have found. But I hope to be on the curling trail <b>again</b> <b>next</b> <b>year.</b> And I'll see you all in Sudbury (the next Scott site) in 2001. Your curling friend, Sandra." [...] However, the optimism in her statement belied the seriousness of her condition. She had been moved to palliative care. She died in her sleep at the Pasqua Hospital Palliative Care Unit on the morning of March 2, 2000 at age 36.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1991, McCall signed for Scottish club Rangers for £1.2 million. Rangers had just won their third {{successive}} Scottish Premier Division title. Under newly appointed manager Walter Smith, McCall ended up playing in the final six of the club's nine successive Scottish league titles. In his first season at Ibrox, Rangers won the league and cup double, before they achieved greater success in 1992–93, winning both cups 2–1 against Aberdeen and coming nine points ahead of Aberdeen in the league. McCall also enjoyed European success that season when the Glasgow club narrowly missed out on an appearance in the UEFA Champions League 1992–93 final, coming second in the semi-final group stage to eventual winners Olympique de Marseille. Citing the reason for their success as the spirit which Smith instilled in the team, McCall later said: [...] "It was an incredible season. We won the domestic Treble, we went 44 games unbeaten {{and we did not}} lose a single game in Europe. And, though we said we would do it <b>again</b> <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> we all knew it was unrepeatable." [...] In 1993–94, Rangers added another Scottish League Cup title along with the league championship, but lost 1–0 in the final of the Scottish Cup to Dundee United, surprisingly being denied a second successive treble. The following season saw Rangers win the league by their greatest margin as they finished 15 points ahead of Motherwell, but they failed to reach the final of either of the domestic cups. Although their winning margin was reduced to four points, from city rivals Celtic, in 1995–96, Rangers' points tally of 87 was a record-high total. McCall played in his fourth Scottish Cup final as Rangers defeated Hearts 5–1. His Rangers side again pushed Celtic into second place in 1996–97 and defeated Hearts 4–3 in the Scottish League Cup. But with the club chasing an unprecedented 10th straight title in 1997–98 they had to settle for the runners-up position, with Celtic winning the league by two points {{on the final day of}} the season. McCall was substituted in the Scottish Cup final defeat to Hearts as Rangers went the season without picking up a single title for the first season in McCall's time at the club.|$|E

Her second attempt to win the Irish contest was a success. Then on Saturday 21 March 1970, the eighteen-year-old schoolgirl performed the song at the Eurovision finals held in the Amsterdam RAI Exhibition and Convention Centre, before an estimated viewing audience of two hundred million. Perched on a stool while wearing an embroidered white mini-dress, she was the last of twelve contestants to perform that night. After the voting had finished she was declared the winner with 32 points, beating the favourite, UK's Mary Hopkin, with 26 and Germany's Katja Ebstein with 12. Spain's Julio Iglesias came equal fourth with Guy Bonnet of France and Henri Dès of Switzerland. This was Ireland's first of a record seven successes in the contest.|$|E
2500|$|Later in 1842, Pasteur {{took the}} {{entrance}} {{test for the}} École Normale Supérieure. He passed {{the first set of}} tests, but because his ranking was low, Pasteur decided not to continue and try <b>again</b> <b>next</b> <b>year.</b> He went back to the Pension Barbet to prepare for the test. He also attended classes at the Lycée Saint-Louis and lectures of Jean-Baptiste Dumas at the Sorbonne. In 1843, he passed the test with a high ranking and entered the École Normale Supérieure. In 1845 he received the licencié ès sciences (Master of Science) degree. In 1846, he was appointed professor of physics at the Collège de Tournon (now called [...] ) in Ardèche, but the chemist Antoine Jérôme Balard wanted him back at the École Normale Supérieure as a graduate laboratory assistant (agrégé préparateur). He joined Balard and simultaneously started his research in crystallography and in 1847, he submitted his two theses, one in chemistry and the other in physics.|$|E
2500|$|At the 2006 U.S. Open, {{played on}} the West course of the Winged Foot Golf Club, Montgomerie had yet another chance to win his first major championship. He {{stood in the middle}} of the 18th fairway in the final round having sunk a 50-foot birdie putt on the 17th green, which put him in the joint lead with Phil Mickelson. While waiting in {{position}} on the 18th fairway for the group in front to finish, Montgomerie switched his club from a 6-iron to a 7-iron, assuming adrenaline would kick in. Once the wait was over, he hit the approach shot poorly, ending up short and right of the green, in thick rough. He pitched onto the green, and then three-putted from 30 feet to lose the tournament by one stroke. After the loss, Montgomerie said, [...] "At my age I've got to think positively. I'm 43 next week, and it's nice I can come back to this tournament and do well again, and I look forward to coming back here <b>again</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> and trying another U.S. Open disaster."

60|$|To dispute this triumph, back came King Edward <b>again,</b> <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> {{landing at}} Ravenspur, {{coming on to}} York, causing all his men to cry 'Long live King Henry!' and {{swearing}} on the altar, without a blush, that he came to lay no claim to the crown. Now was {{the time for the}} Duke of Clarence, who ordered his men to assume the White Rose, and declare for his brother. The Marquis of Montague, though the Earl of Warwick's brother, also declining to fight against King Edward, he went on successfully to London, where the Archbishop of York let him into the City, and where the people made great demonstrations in his favour. For this they had four reasons. Firstly, there were great numbers of the King's adherents hiding in the City and ready to break out; secondly, the King owed them a great deal of money, which they could never hope to get if he were unsuccessful; thirdly, there was a young prince to inherit the crown; and fourthly, the King was gay and handsome, and more popular than a better man might have been with the City ladies. After a stay of only two days with these worthy supporters, the King marched out to Barnet Common, to give the Earl of Warwick battle. And now it was to be seen, for the last time, whether the King or the King-Maker was to carry the day.|$|E

I have no daughters to marry off, no personal interest in the comedy, so I look on and like it, and enjoy my home during the other nine months all the better for having been away. We do not often come abroad. I suppose now these railways are being made everywhere there will be a great deal more travelling about, but I don't think we should often come. You talk of the bustle of life in London, it is nothing to the bustle of travelling. As soon as one gets settled down at an hotel it is time to be going on. If I come out <b>again</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> I shall persuade my husband to take a little châlet high up on the hill there, where one can rest and take one's fill of the view of those mountains.
