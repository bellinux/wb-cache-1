50|$|Scientists {{suggest that}} the {{different}} levels <b>of</b> <b>alliances</b> in bottlenose dolphins have risen from different evolutionary contexts. Inclusive fitness is suggested as {{the driving force behind}} first order <b>alliances</b> <b>of</b> related individuals. However, first order <b>alliances</b> composed <b>of</b> unrelated individuals as well as second <b>alliances</b> <b>of</b> unrelated individuals also occur, indicating that there may be another mechanism favoring the formation <b>of</b> male <b>alliances.</b> Additionally, congruent research also supports earlier predictions of high female promiscuity, which would decrease the value <b>of</b> male <b>alliances.</b> There are also potential mutualistic benefits for individuals involved in the alliance 3. Such benefits may include more effective female guarding which in turn further enhances the reproductive success <b>of</b> <b>alliance</b> members. These findings further demonstrate that the formation <b>of</b> male <b>alliances</b> is highly variable and context dependent.|$|R
