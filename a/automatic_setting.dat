500|$|In 1965, the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps' primary {{machine guns}} were the M2 Browning and M60. The M2 was a large-caliber heavy machine gun, usually mounted on {{vehicles}} or in fixed emplacements. The M60 {{was a more}} mobile medium machine gun intended to be carried with the troops to provide heavy automatic fire. Both were very heavy weapons and usually required a crew {{of at least two}} to operate efficiently. The Browning automatic rifle, the army's main individual machine gun since its introduction in World War I, was phased out in 1957 with the introduction of the M14 rifle, which had a fully automatic mode. [...] "Designated riflemen" [...] in every squad were ordered to use their weapons on the fully <b>automatic</b> <b>setting,</b> while other troops were required to use their rifle's semi-automatic mode on most occasions to increase accuracy and conserve ammunition. Because the M14 and M16 rifles had not been designed with sustained automatic fire in mind, they often overheated or jammed. The 20-round and 30-round magazines of these weapons limited their sustained automatic effectiveness when compared to belt-fed weapons.|$|E

5000|$|The {{action was}} also modified, {{replacing}} the fully <b>automatic</b> <b>setting</b> with a three-round burst setting. When using a fully automatic weapon, inexperienced troops often {{hold down the}} trigger and [...] "spray" [...] when under fire. The U.S. Army concluded that three-shot groups provide an optimum combination of ammunition conservation, accuracy, and firepower. [...] The USMC has retired the M16A2 in favour of the newer M16A4, although a few M16A2s are still in use by the United States Marine Corps today. Many M16A2s remain in service with the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard.|$|E
50|$|The MP5A4 (fixed stock) and MP5A5 (sliding stock) models, {{which were}} {{introduced}} in 1974, are available with four-position trigger groups. The pistol grips are straight, lacking the contoured grip and thumb groove of the MP5A1, MP5A2, and MP5A3. The selector lever stops are marked with bullet pictograms rather than letters or numbers (each symbol represents the number of bullets that will be fired when the trigger is pulled and held rearward with a full magazine inserted in the weapon) and are fully ambidextrous (the selector lever is present {{on each side of}} the trigger housing). The additional setting of the fire selector, one place before the fully <b>automatic</b> <b>setting,</b> enables a two or three-shot burst firing mode.|$|E
50|$|The Colt/Diemaco weapon {{can trace}} its lineage {{back to a}} number of weapons {{developed}} both at Colt and by the US military. These weapons were all designed to fill the role of the Browning Automatic Rifle. The BAR was originally planned to have been replaced by the M15. The BAR was ultimately replaced by the M16A1; one rifleman was supposed to use this weapon's fully <b>automatic</b> <b>setting</b> {{while the rest of the}} squad used semi-automatic. Throughout the period between the introduction of the M16 and the introduction of the M249 as a purpose-built squad automatic weapon at the end of the SAW trials, interim weapons were developed and tested in order to fill the gap.|$|E

The Uzi carbine is fitted with a 16 in barrel (400mm), to meet the minimum rifle barrel length requirement for civilian sales in the United States. A small number of Uzi carbines were produced with the standard length barrel for special markets. It fires from a closed-bolt position in semi-automatic mode only and uses a floating firing pin {{as opposed to a}} fixed firing pin. The FS-style selector switch has two positions (the <b>automatic</b> <b>setting</b> was blocked): [...] "F" [...] for [...] "fire" [...] (semi-auto) and [...] "S" [...] for [...] "safe".

5000|$|During the 1980s Colt {{decided to}} expand on the basic ideas that had been exposed in the WAK and BRL guns.

An angled foregrip was added to the handguard to improve handling as an automatic rifle.
