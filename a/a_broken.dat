5|$|The game {{features}} no heads-up display. Instead, {{condition of}} the player character is relayed through the sound cues of his heartbeat and breathing, which become more pronounced when wounded, and color draining from the screen with loss of blood and strength. Specific injuries are also indicated visually and aurally: for example, <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> leg causes the character to limp while making appropriate noises, while <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> arm makes aiming more difficult. The health system {{was designed as a}} more realistic take on character injury than other games of its genre in that different wounds, including poisoning and bleeding, require different remedies, such as a splint for <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> leg. The inventory screen shows the character's injuries (displayed on his character model) and all carried items.|$|E
