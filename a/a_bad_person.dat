Magwayan, the soul ferry god, carries the souls of the Yligueynes to the abode of the dead called Solad. But when <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>person</b> dies, the diwata Pandakesita brings him to the place of punishment in the abode of the dead, where his soul will wait {{to move on to the}} Ologan or heaven. While the dead is undergoing punishment, his family could help him by asking the priests or priestesses to offer ceremonies and prayers so that he might go to the place of rest in heaven.|$|E

[...] Although Dylan becomes a murderer {{at the beginning of the}} story, Brubaker hopes the character's plight is sympathetic enough that readers will root for him. Dylan's arrangement with the demon has been interpreted as commentary on the War on Terror and the racially motivated violence publicised in the US in the two years prior to the book's publication.|$|E
50|$|This sort of {{confusion}} between the Good and pleasurealso arises when we confuse {{the concepts of}} good versus evil with the concepts of good versus bad. The good, when contrasted with the bad, is really just pleasure. But {{this is not the}} case with the good, in the sense of morally good. A morally good person may suffer from <b>a</b> painful disease (<b>bad),</b> but he does not therefore become <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> (evil) <b>person.</b> If <b>a</b> morally <b>bad</b> <b>person</b> is punished for his crimes, it may be bad (painful) for him, but good and just in the moral sense.|$|R

The entry was Amann's fourth episode written for the series, after season seven's [...] "Rush" [...] and [...] "Chimera" [...] and season eight's [...] "Invocation". Executive producer John Shiban later explained that, since Doggett and Reyes were {{in control of the}} X-Files, the producers needed to give one of them a drive. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz was interested in taking Annabeth Gish's character into a darker area. According to Mat Hurwitz and Chris Knowles in their book The Complete X-Files, the episode deals with themes of [...] "reincarnation and the idea of karmic justice." [...] Shiban noted that the conceit of the episode was whether Reyes was [...] "a good person or <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>person?</b> Did she fight evil, or did she let evil happen." [...] It has been noted that the episode's plot is similar to mythology surrounding the Aztec agriculture god Xipe Totec.

Struthers was particularly saddened by the fact that her character steals food from the same starving children she had been working to help. Parker and Stone were slightly remorseful when they learned of her reaction and have said they did not have anything against Struthers personally. Nevertheless, Struthers was portrayed in an even less flattering way in the third season episode [...] "Starvin' Marvin in Space" [...] as a Jabba the Hutt-like creature.

Talking to the Daily Mirror shortly after appearing on-screen {{for the first time in}} April, Oberman declared, [...] "Chrissie is the sort of woman I'd really like to be friends with... She's an Essex girl who was brought up in a family of brothers, so she knows how to work men. She understands that what they say is not always what they mean." [...] In her official character profile, Chrissie is portrayed as someone [...] "happy to play mind games" [...] and [...] "often two steps ahead of her husband", being described as [...] "the type of person to be your best friend. But if you cross her, she'll get her own back in the end." [...] Her strong-willed persona has led reviewers to label the character as [...] "venomous", [...] "sinister" [...] "devious", and [...] "hard as nails" [...] in [...] "the grand tradition of landladies of the Queen Vic", manipulating others to ensure matters go her way. As the [...] "scheming" [...] figure of the show, she was described as a [...] "witch" [...] and [...] "super-bitch", but was also represented as [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "clever" [...] woman. Executive producer Kate Harwood characterised Chrissie as a survivor, someone who [...] "thinks on her feet" [...] whatever the situation.

2500|$|Self-esteem is {{attractive}} {{as a social}} psychological construct because researchers have conceptualized it as an influential predictor of certain outcomes, such as academic achievement, happiness, satisfaction in marriage and relationships, and criminal behaviour.

2500|$|During Escrivá's beatification process, Monsignor Vladimir Felzmann, who {{had been}} Escrivá's {{personal}} assistant before Felzmann quit Opus Dei and became a priest of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Westminster and an aide to Cardinal Basil Hume, sent several letters to Fr.

[...] Felzmann later explained that those remarks should be regarded in the context of Catholic anti-communism in Spain, emphasizing that during 1941 all of the male members of Opus Dei (who then numbered about fifty) offered to join the [...] "Blue Division", a group of Spaniard volunteers who joined the German forces in their fight against the Soviet Army, along the eastern front.

Participants higher in religiosity engaged in greater immanent justice reasoning when the victim was bad, but not when he was good.

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>bad</b> {{reputation}} can persistently affect {{judgments of}} an individual even when {{it turns out to}} be invalid and ought to be disregarded. Such indelible distrust may reflect that the negative evaluation elicited by <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> reputation transfers to a person. Consequently, the person him/herself may come to activate this negative evaluation irrespective of the accuracy of the reputation. If this theoretical model is correct, an evaluation-related brain region will be activated when witnessing <b>a</b> <b>person</b> whose <b>bad</b> reputation one has learned about, regardless of whether the reputation is deemed valid or not. Here we tested this neural hypothesis with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants memorized faces paired with either a good or <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> reputation. Next, they viewed the faces alone and inferred whether each person was likely to cooperate, first while retrieving the reputations, and then while trying to disregard them as false. A region of the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, which may be involved in negative evaluation, was activated by faces previously paired with bad reputations, irrespective of whether participants attempted to retrieve or disregard these reputations. Furthermore, participants showing greater activity of the left ventrolateral prefrontal region in response to the faces with bad reputations were more likely to infer that these individuals would not cooperate. Thus, once associated with <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> reputation, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> may elicit evaluation-related brain responses on their own, thereby evoking distrust independently of their reputation...|$|R
30|$|Because not all {{decisions}} are merely rational calculations, {{the theory of}} self-concept maintenance (Mazar et al. 2008) expands this view by adding a further decision criterion: {{the maintenance of a}} person’s self-concept, notably as <b>a</b> good or <b>bad</b> <b>person.</b> According to this approach, people cope with situations, including deviant behavior that generally would negatively impact their self-concept, for instance, by re-categorizing the situation. This means that if the deviant behavior falls below a certain limit, people will deviate without compromising their self-concept in a negative way (Mazar et al. 2008). Transferred to the design of a code, a code of conduct, which defines its regulations in a clear-cut way, for instance by setting forth specific values of accepting and granting gifts, constitutes clear behavioral limits. Such a clear and straightforward code makes it more difficult for people to ‘bend’ the regulations of the code by leaving little to no room for interpretation. Thus, when violating a code’s norm, {{it is more likely that}} a person’s self-concept is negatively affected. As persons strive for maintaining a self-concept as a moral person (Mazar et al. 2008), it is more likely that they abide by the code.|$|R
