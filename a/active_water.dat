25|$|Plants {{demonstrate}} {{best the}} great {{value of the}} exceptional preservation of the Rhynie chert. The presence of soft tissue, including parenchyma, is not observed elsewhere in the fossil record until the advent of amber in the Triassic. This allows the study of structures such as the air spaces behind stomata, whereas the conventional record at its best allows {{no more than the}} counting of stomata. It has also enabled paleobotanists to firmly deduce that plants such as Aglaophyton were not aquatic, as once believed. Further, as plants are preserved in situ, the study of exactly how and why the branching patterns of the early plants emerged is possible, whereas typical fossils only show that branching was present. The analysis of rhizomes and rhizoids makes it possible to discern which plants had an <b>active</b> <b>water</b> uptake system (e.g. Horneophyton), and which were likely to have colonised waterlogged surfaces (Asteroxylon). In some cases, it is possible to see different mechanisms of repairing wounds, and to deduce that they were caused by fungal or bacterial infection.|$|E

2500|$|Jet blast {{deflectors}} aboard {{aircraft carriers}} {{are placed in}} very {{close proximity to the}} [...] temperatures of modern jet fighter exhaust. The non-skid decking surface of the deflector suffers heat damage and requires frequent maintenance or replacement. Additionally, the hot deflector surface cannot be used as normal decking until it has cooled enough to allow aircraft tires to roll over it. To mitigate the heat problem, active cooling systems were installed in the 1970s, tapping the fire mains (fire suppression water systems) to use seawater circulating through water lines within the deflector panel. However, the water cooling system adds more complexity and failure points, and requires additional maintenance. The most recent method tried by the United States Navy for solving the heat problem was introduced in 2008 with USS George H.W. Bush which uses heavy-duty metal panels covered in heat-dissipating ceramic tiles similar to those used on the Space Shuttle. The tiled panels can be changed quickly and easily—the ship carries a large replacement supply. Without <b>active</b> <b>water</b> lines, the passively-tiled deflector is expected to require much less maintenance.|$|E

50|$|Active {{absorption}} {{refers to}} the absorption of water by roots {{with the help of}} ATP, generated by the root respiration: as the root cells actively take part in the process, it is called active absorption. According to Renner, active absorption takes place in low transpiring and well-watered plants, and 4% of total water absorption is carried out in this process. The active absorption is carried out by two theories; <b>active</b> osmotic <b>water</b> absorption and <b>Active</b> non-osmotic <b>water</b> absorption. In this process energy is required.|$|R

40|$|Aristolochene synthase (ATAS) is a high-fidelity terpenoid cyclase that {{converts}} farnesyl diphosphate exclusively into the bicyclic hydrocarbon aristolochene. Previously-determined crystal structures of ATAS complexes revealed trapped <b>active</b> site <b>water</b> molecules {{that could potentially}} interact with catalytic intermediates: water "w" hydrogen bonds with S 303 and N 299, water molecules "w 1 " and "w 2 " hydrogen bond with Q 151, and a fourth water molecule is coordinated to the Mg 2 +C ion. There is no obvious role for water in the ATAS mechanism, since the enzyme exclusively generates a hydrocarbon product. Thus, these water molecules are tightly controlled so that they cannot react with carbocation intermediates. Steady-state kinetics and product distribution analyses of eight ATAS mutants designed to perturb interactions with <b>active</b> site <b>water</b> molecules (S 303 A, S 303 H, S 303 D, N 299 A, N 299 L, N 299 A/S 303 A, Q 151 H, and Q 151 E) indicate relatively modest effects on catalysis but significant effects on sesquiterpene product distributions. X-ray crystal structures of S 303 A, N 299 A, N 299 A/S 303 A, and Q 151 H mutants reveal minimal perturbation of active site solvent structure. Seven of the eight mutants generate farnesol and nerolidol, possibly resulting from addition of the Mg 2 +C-bound water molecule to the initially formed farnesyl cation, but no products are generated that would suggest enhanced reactivity of other <b>active</b> site <b>water</b> molecules. However, intermediate germacrene A tends to accumulate in these mutants. Thus, apart from the possible reactivity of Mg 2 +C-bound <b>water,</b> <b>active</b> site <b>water</b> molecules in ATAS are not {{directly involved in the}} chemistry of catalysis, but instead contribute to the template that governs the conformation of the flexible substrate and carbocation intermediates...|$|R
