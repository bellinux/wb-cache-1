5|$|His final {{re-election}} campaign came in 1990 against businessman Harry Lonsdale. Lonsdale aggressively went after Hatfield with television attack ads that attacked Hatfield {{as out of}} touch {{on issues such as}} abortion and timber management and accused the incumbent of being too closely allied with special interest groups in Washington. Lonsdale's tactics moved him even with, and then ahead of Hatfield in some polls. Hatfield, who had typically stayed <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>fray</b> of negative campaigning, was forced to respond in kind with attack ads of his own. He raised $1million in a single month after trailing Lonsdale in the polls before the November election. He defeated the Democrat with 590,095 (53.7percent) votes to 507,743 (46.2percent) votes.|$|E
5|$|Nixon's agenda {{had been}} impeded {{by the fact}} that Congress was {{controlled}} by Democrats and he hoped {{to take control of the}} Senate in the 1970 midterm elections. Worried that Agnew was too divisive a figure, Nixon and his aides initially planned to restrict Agnew's role to fundraising and the giving of a standard stump speech that would avoid personal attacks. The president believed that appealing to white, middle- and lower-class voters on social issues would lead to Republican victories in November. He planned not to do any active campaigning, but to remain <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>fray</b> and let Agnew campaign as spokesman for the Silent Majority.|$|E

5000|$|The Liberal Party had {{undergone}} a revival {{under the leadership of}} Jeremy Thorpe, winning a string of by-elections in 1972 and 1973. It had begun to appeal to disaffected Conservative voters, and continued to do so throughout the campaign. Thorpe came across as young and charismatic, often attempting to appear <b>above</b> <b>the</b> two-party <b>fray.</b> Their manifesto [...] "You can Change the Face of Britain" [...] promised voting reform and devolution, although Sandbrook has described their economic policy as [...] "impossibly vague".|$|R
40|$|Analysts who act as {{employees}} or advisors in agencies that make public policy {{may find themselves}} operating in any of several different roles. They may see themselves as objective technicians, <b>above</b> <b>the</b> political <b>fray,</b> or as advocates of causes of their own choosing, or as unquestioning proponents of the positions adopted by their employers. Their choice of roles will differ, according to some systematic characteristics found in the environment. Any serious effort to develop a code for the behavior of policy analysts must take these differences into account. ...|$|R
25|$|Bergson {{responds}} {{by saying}} that the antinomies are the result of analysis, not intuition. An example of this is Duration itself, which Bergson maintains isn’t a multiplicity or a unity. Depending on the viewpoint from which one begins, he will either reconstruct the absolute Duration as a unity or a multiplicity. Hence the antinomy of substance pluralism and substance monism, which can only be resolved through showing they are two representations of the same thing via a simple act of intuition. Thus real philosophy consists in placing oneself <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>fray</b> of oppositional schools of thought.|$|E
25|$|On 4 April 1918, Richthofen was {{assigned}} to Jagdgeschwader 1, commanded by his cousin Manfred von Richthofen. On 21 April, Wolfram flew his first mission. As he was a new pilot, Manfred instructed him to avoid the fighting. When the squadron became engaged in a dogfight, Wolfram climbed and circled <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>fray.</b> Lieutenant Wilfred May also a new pilot was also circling above the dogfight. He attacked and pursued Richtofen. Seeing this Manfred pursued May, and was in turn pursued by Captain Roy Brown, a former school friend of May. It was in this pursuit that Manfred was killed in action.|$|E
500|$|On October 14, 1969, the {{day before}} the anti-war Moratorium, North Vietnamese premier Pham Van Dong {{released}} a letter supporting demonstrations in the United States. Nixon resented this, but on the advice of his aides, thought it best to say nothing, and instead had Agnew give a press conference at the White House, calling upon the Moratorium protesters to disavow the support of the North Vietnamese. Agnew handled the task well, and Nixon tasked Agnew with attacking the Democrats generally, while remaining <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>fray</b> himself. This was analogous to the role Nixon had performed as vice president in the Eisenhower White House, thus Agnew was dubbed [...] "Nixon's Nixon". Agnew had finally found a role in the Nixon administration, one he enjoyed very much.|$|E

5000|$|After the Nazis {{seized power}} in Germany in 1933, Hauptmann signed a loyalty oath of the German Academy of Literature, {{a section of}} the Prussian Academy of Arts. In the summer of the same year, {{according}} to writer and historian Ernst Klee, he applied for membership in the Nazi party but his application was denied by the regional party office. His copy of Mein Kampf, which can now be found in the Hauptmann collection at the Berlin State Library, was also heavily annotated. However, in his self-image Hauptmann remained a poet, <b>above</b> <b>the</b> political <b>fray</b> and nothing from the Nazi ideology was incorporated into his works. However, he had earlier been {{a founding member of the}} eugenics organization the German Society for Racial Hygiene, in Berlin in 1905, and his play Before Sunrise is deeply concerned with hereditary alcoholism, a popular idea with eugenicists, and the main character rejects his fiancee due to concerns about his potential children's genetics. Nevertheless, a report from the Amt Rosenberg, the Nazi culture policy body, from 1942 stated: [...] "With all recognition of Hauptmann's artistic creative power, the ideological stance of most of his works is, from a national-socialist perspective, to be regarded very critically." ...|$|R

2500|$|As a well-funded incumbent, Packwood was {{expected}} to have a fairly easy road to re-election and led by double digit margins in most early polls. Packwood chose defense spending as his key issue in the campaign while Kulongoski focused on the economy and unemployment. Nathan hammered at core Libertarian principles of limited government, with a goal of 5% of votes which would keep the party as a valid minor party. The three candidates agreed to three debates, to be held across the state in the summer of 1980. As the challenger, Kulongoski aggressively attempted to engage Packwood in the debates, but the debate format did not allow the candidates to ask follow-up questions or rebut each other's statements and Packwood was largely able to avoid confrontation and stay <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>fray.</b> As the campaign wore on, Kulongoski grew more confident and tried to appeal to Oregonians' independent values by saying that Packwood's enormous cash advantage was due to [...] "eastern" [...] money.|$|E
