40|$|In {{county of}} Cluj the major causes of <b>arsons</b> are {{represented}} by the unattended fires (especially by tourist {{but also by the}} agricultural or sylvicultural workers) and because are light up meadows and the fire could not be controlled. The major overwhelming forest fires (more than 90 %) happened during spring time (after the snow melt down and before the vegetation started) and during autumn (after the leaves falls and before snowing). To localize and to extinguish fires is very difficult when winds are more or less intense. Another factor is represented by the situation of erbacee vegetation or shrubs and bushes which are directly proportioned with their drying grade. The high humidity of soil might stop or to reduce the propagation of forest <b>arsons.</b> Through studied area was made a real situation of damages produced by <b>arsons</b> in period of 2000 – 2005 (table 1) Table 1 Situation of forest <b>arsons</b> recorded in Cluj county in period of 2000 - 2005 Number of <b>arsons</b> The cause of fire Nr crt Year to ta l be llo...|$|R

5000|$|Church burnings: A wave {{of church}} burnings in Norway during the 1990s {{has been cited}} {{as an act of}} neo-pagan terrorism. The <b>arsons</b> coincided with a {{resurgence}} in the popularity of European black metal. This genre of music featured the imagery and ideas of neo-paganism, Satanism, and nationalism. The targets were Christian churches, and up to 28 churches were targeted during this period. Popular black metal musician Varg Vikernes, a noted neo-pagan and nationalist, was convicted of three of these <b>arsons</b> and charged with a fourth attempt.|$|R
5|$|Section 1(3) of the 1971 Act {{specifies}} that offences {{under section}} 1, where the destruction or damage {{is caused by}} fire, shall be charged as <b>arson.</b> It would seem that courts adopt a purposive view {{in relation to the}} lawful excuse defence in relation to <b>arson,</b> as in R v. Hunt (1977). The defendant, wishing to highlight the lack of fire defences in an old people's home, set fire to it to demonstrate the risks. He claimed an honest belief in that by doing this, he had a lawful excuse within section 5(2). It was held, however, that he had not actually been acting so as to protect property. Although the court assumed that his belief was honest, it ruled that his intention was to draw attention to faulty fire defences rather than to defend the property itself.|$|E

5000|$|Officials {{have said}} the fires {{do not appear to}} follow a clear pattern. Coatesville Police Chief William Matthews has said more than one person appears to be {{involved}} in the <b>arsons,</b> based on the large number of fires and the fact that many had occurred within minutes of one another. Some of the fires are believed to have been copycats, especially since the <b>arsons</b> continued after three people were arrested in December; Coatesville city manager Harry Walker said of the <b>arsons,</b> [...] "The more we caught them, the more fires were set." [...] Police have also said they believe the fires may be part of a gang initiation, but have declined to provide media outlets more information about the theory. Chester County District Attorney Joseph Carroll has suggested the arsonists may have a gripe against the local government because they are striking almost entirely within the city limits, despite the intense investigation that has continued to take place there.|$|R

Cesario and Rosenbloom decided to enter plea agreements since Sherman had already implicated Arrow. All three entered guilty pleas and while Sherman named the high-profile activist Arrow as the mastermind behind the <b>arsons,</b> Cesario and Rosenbloom disputed this and testified that Jacob himself was the mastermind.|$|R
