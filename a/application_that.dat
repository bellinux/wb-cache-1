5|$|V7 {{consists}} of four integrated elements. The user typically interacts with V7's open-source GUI, named FAHControl. This has Novice, Advanced, and Expert user interface modes, and {{has the ability to}} monitor, configure, and control many remote folding clients from one computer. FAHControl directs FAHClient, a back-end <b>application</b> <b>that</b> in turn manages each FAHSlot (or slot). Each slot acts as replacement for the formerly distinct Folding@home v6 uniprocessor, SMP, or GPU computer clients, as it can download, process, and upload work units independently. The FAHViewer function, modeled after the PS3's viewer, displays a real-time 3-D rendering, if available, of the protein currently being processed.|$|E

5|$|According to the New England Historical Genealogical Society, {{several members}} of Warren's {{maternal}} family claim Cherokee heritage; the Society found a family newsletter that alluded to a marriage license <b>application</b> <b>that</b> listed Elizabeth Warren’s great-great-great grandmother as a Cherokee, but {{could not find the}} primary document and found no proof of Warren's Native American heritage. The Oklahoma Historical Society stated that finding a definitive answer about Native American heritage can be difficult because of intermarriage and deliberate avoidance of registration. Some members of the Cherokee Nation protested her claim to Native American ancestry and questioned whether she benefitted from it. Former colleagues and supervisors at the universities where she had worked (including Charles Fried, former Solicitor General under President Ronald Reagan) said Warren's ancestry was either not mentioned, or played no role in her hiring.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, it was {{announced}} SITA had plans to build another EfW plant adjacent to the current one, named the North East Energy Recovery Centre (NEERC).

Permission for the plant's construction was granted on 15 October 2008. On 17 September 2010, it {{was announced}} that SITA had signed a contract with the South Tyne and Wear Waste Management Partnership for their waste to be burned at NEERC once the plant was completed. Construction is expected to begin in early 2011, in time for a 2013 completion date.|$|E
5|$|Metallic lead beads {{dating back}} to 7000–6500 BCE {{have been found in}} Asia Minor and may {{represent}} the first example of metal smelting. At that time lead had few (if any) applications due to its softness and dull appearance. The major reason for the spread of lead production was its association with silver, which may be obtained by burning galena (a common lead mineral). The Ancient Egyptians were the first to use lead minerals in cosmetics, an <b>application</b> <b>that</b> spread to Ancient Greece and beyond; the Egyptians may have used lead for sinkers in fishing nets, glazes, glasses, enamels, and for ornaments. Various civilizations of the Fertile Crescent used lead as a writing material, as currency, and for construction. Lead was used in the Ancient Chinese royal court as a stimulant, as currency, and as a contraceptive; the Indus Valley civilization and the Mesoamericans used it for making amulets; and the eastern and southern African peoples used lead in wire drawing.|$|E

5|$|The campus fare-free bus {{transit system}} began in 1990 and runs {{throughout}} {{the campus and}} surrounding neighborhoods. In 2005 the university started testing Hybrid buses on the service's main route. The first hybrid bus on the system used a proprietary diesel-electric propulsion system, known as a Hybrid Booster Drive (HBD), and {{was developed by the}} Electric Vehicle Institute (EVI) within the BGSU College of Technology. The system is made up of four routes. It includes major stops at various residence halls, academic buildings and athletic buildings. The campus has a phone <b>application</b> <b>that</b> allows the students to track the location of the different buses around campus. This application also gives an estimated time on the buses arrival to the bus stops.|$|E
5|$|On September 19, 2012, iOS 6 was {{released}} to the iPhone 4S among other compatible iOS device as an over the air (OTA) upgrade package. According to Apple the update contains 200 new features and tweaks, which includes a new maps app, dubbed Apple Maps, Facebook integration and Passbook, an <b>application</b> <b>that</b> allows users to store their coupons, boarding passes and tickets digitally. On September 18, 2013, Apple released iOS 7 and the iPhone 4S is among other compatible iOS devices that also receive the update without any lagging issues compared to the iPhone 4. Although the device has improved performance over iOS 7, some newer features that were released to newer models such as AirDrop and CarPlay were not supported. The iPhone 4S can also run iOS 8, which {{was released}} on September 17, 2014. Given that the device was supported for more than 3 years, some newer features of the software such as Apple Pay were not supported. It is also unable to work with Apple Watch due to the relatively aged hardware. In fact, some users often reported that performance on the 4S is very slow, similar to how iOS 7 ran on the iPhone 4, and suggesting {{that they should not}} upgrade due to battery draining issues and hanging up on calls. Meanwhile, Apple released iOS 8.1.1, which brought slight improvements to the phone and the iPad 2, but it still did not run as fast as newer models.|$|E
