25|$|I {{grew up on}} the Jersey Shore, on {{a little}} barrier island. The Atlantic Ocean was on one side, the bay was on the other. Everyone there hunted and fished and clammed and got crabs out of the bay. And one day my brother told me someone had come down from the Bureau of Petty Harassment or {{something}} and they measured the temperature of the water and had decided it was a little too warm and a certain type of bacteria might incubate in it and there was a chance that might harm the clams. And so, from now on, no one was supposed to take clams out of the bay anymore. Which everyone ignored. And no one died. That was before the government got tenacious <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff.</b> So I thought that was pretty stupid right there.|$|E

When you hear that song — the whole bounce of the record and the way she's flipping it and the stuff she talking about ... I knew that record was gonna go just because you never heard Mariah talk <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff.</b> ... She's like, 'I packed up my Louis Vuitton.' She took it really on the ghetto side. I knew that was gonna strike people. Either it was gonna hit them in a wrong way or they was gonna love it.|$|E
500|$|Drummer Lars Ulrich {{achieved}} a unique sound on St. Anger by {{turning off the}} snares on his snare drum resulting in a drum tone with far more [...] "ring" [...] than is usual in rock and metal. This sound received much backlash from fans and critics alike. Ulrich said, [...] "One day I forgot to turn the snare on because I wasn't thinking <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff.</b> At the playbacks, I decided I was really liking what I was hearing—it had a different ambience. It sang back {{to me in a}} beautiful way." [...] Regarding the backlash about the sound, he stated, [...] "It's crazy, that kind of closed-mindedness." [...] Rock said, [...] "I would say I've only [...] this brutal [...] when I've done demos. It probably sounds heavier because it's Metallica, but really this was a 15-minutes-on-the-drum-sound type of thing." ...|$|E

Li Zhuang, a lawyer who was imprisoned as part of the [...] "Striking Black" [...] policy, said that [...] "the Chongqing model is problematic because the city's leaders do not follow the rule of law". According to Andrew J. Nathan, a political scientist at Columbia University, [...] "the risk for China is that this scandal could taint everyone in power and challenge the legitimacy of the regime". Furthermore, he said, “All the worst things you ever imagined are actually true” and “It’s not like nobody knew <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff,</b> but now they know that it really is true and it’s as bad as it can possibly be.” ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2013, Activision {{community}} manager Dan Amrich attempted {{to explain the}} acquisition history of the No One Lives Forever IP in a public video. This history includes the 2003 acquisition of NOLF publisher Fox Interactive by Vivendi Universal Games (who also owned Sierra Entertainment), {{as well as the}} 2008 merger between Vivendi Universal Games (VUG, which had since been renamed Vivendi Games) and video game publisher Activision, forming the Activision Blizzard holding company. After the merger, Activision decided to sell off some IPs and retain others. In order to find out the legal details behind NOLF, Amrich asked his colleagues, saying that [...] "he person that I normally talk to <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> does not believe that we [...] currently have the rights.

[...] Amrich also asked a friend of his who working at NOLF developer Monolith (since acquired by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment), who also did not know who the IP belonged to. Amrich concluded that [...] "at this time I do not believe that Activision has the rights to No One Lives Forever." ...|$|E
2500|$|Obama {{communications}} aide Robert Gibbs, who {{had worked}} for Kerry's campaign, recommended Favreau to Obama as an excellent writer, and in 2005 he began working for Barack Obama in his United States Senate office, before joining Obama's presidential campaign as chief speechwriter in 2006. His interview with Obama was on the Senator's first day. Uninterested in Favreau's résumé, Obama instead questioned Favreau on what motivated him to work in politics, and what his theory of writing was. He described this theory to Obama as, [...] "A speech can broaden the circle of people who care <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff.</b> How {{do you say to the}} average person that's been hurting: 'I hear you, I'm there?' Even though you've been so disappointed and cynical about politics in the past, and with good reason, we can move in the right direction. Just give me a chance." ...|$|E

500|$|Maulbetsch {{was said}} to run [...] "so low that he could dash under an {{ordinary}} table without losing his feet." [...] At a coaching conference in the 1920s, a coach doubted the table-ducking story and challenged Maulbetsch. [...] The doubter later recalled: [...] "I began ribbing him <b>about</b> <b>this</b> table-ducking <b>stuff</b> and finally offered to bet him he couldn’t do it. [...] Well, we got a table up in a room, Johnny tucked a water pitcher {{under his arm and}} backed against the wall. [...] Darned if he didn’t do it, the only thing, that water pitcher broke in a million pieces." [...] Asked about the incident, Maulbetsch said it was true, except one part. [...] Maulbetsch insisted there wasn’t a nick on the pitcher.|$|R
2500|$|In 2001, Bob Costas {{claimed that}} despite still loving the game, he now felt a certain {{alienation}} from the institution. By {{the time that}} NBC lost Major League Baseball {{for the second time}} in twelve years, the sport endured a strike, realignment, the introduction of the wild card round, and NBC's complete loss of the regular season Game of the Week. Costas would add that since NBC only did a few games each year and he lacked the forum that he would eventually have (on HBO's On the Record with Bob Costas, Inside the NFL and Costas Now as well as Costas on the Radio) to express his views, he to some extent, started editorializing in games. When asked about whether or not the fact that NBC no longer had the baseball rights was disappointing, Bob Costas said [...] "I'm a little disappointed to lose baseball, but that's the way the business is. And it's not nearly as disappointing as it was when we lost it at the end of the '80s. Because then it was like baseball was the birthright for NBC. ... (Baseball is) not going to affect any decision that I have in the future. It's nowhere near as devastating as a decade ago. Different circumstances, different time. I miss it a little bit but not a lot. I am very philosophical <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff.</b> I have had wonderful opportunities in my career and no one wants to hear me complain about anything." [...] In 2009, Costas would become a contributor and occasional play-by-play announcer for MLB Network.|$|E

5000|$|Quisp and the {{similarly}} marketed cereal Quake {{were originally}} released in 1965 in the United States by the Quaker Oats Company and generally advertised together (during the same commercial) with their character mascots competing against each other. The ads were cartoons created by Jay Ward, who also created the cartoon characters Rocky and Bullwinkle, Dudley Do-Right, and many others, and the Quisp ads {{used some of}} the same voice actors as the Rocky and Bullwinkle series, including Daws Butler as the voice of Quisp (an alien who was the Crown Prince of Planet Q and, like moon men Gidney and Cloyd of Rocky and Bullwinkle, was armed with a scrooch gun) and William Conrad as the voice of Quake (a miner). In an interview, Ward's creative partner Bill Scott described Ward's involvement in cereal advertising: [...] "When the cereal company approached Jay <b>about</b> doing <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> — I think it was in 1961 — he said, 'We’ll only do it as long as it’s fun.'" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{gave the}} {{helmsman}} the course, {{and going to}} the cabin, opened a tin box that held letters for England and manifests of cargo. He must copy these out on the bills of lading when he transshipped the goods and as he studied the lists he felt some surprise. Columbine did not carry much but her freight was valuable. Some had been put on board without his knowing and he thought it strange Wyndham had not talked about its cost. For example, there were small pearls. One found pearls at places on the Caribbean, but the fisheries were jealously guarded and none were near the lagoon. Then there was a packet of ambergris and Marston knew ambergris was worth much. Don Felix had said nothing <b>about</b> <b>this</b> curious <b>stuff,</b> which the cachalot whales throw up, and Marston wondered where Wyndham had got it.|$|R

According to court records, he allegedly told his coworkers, [...] "You cant write <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> all the time if you dont experience it." [...] Tinsley {{was found guilty of}} five counts of child molestation and sentenced to six years in prison although he only spent 23 months behind bars.

5000|$|The {{issue of}} youth {{violence}} is a matter close to the group. Foster was bullied in high school, while bassist Cubbie Fink has a cousin who survived the Columbine High School massacre in 1999. Fink said of his cousin's experience, [...] "She was actually in the library when everything went down, so I actually flew out {{to be with her}} the day after it happened and experienced the trauma surrounding it and saw how affected she was by it. She is as close as a sister, so obviously, it affected me deeply. So {{to be able to have}} a song to create a platform to talk <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> has been good for us." ...|$|E

Or some terrible, gross act of violence or whatever done right in front of you, I mean you'd react to it, no matter how many movies you've watched or how much gore metal you've listened to or whatever, I'm sure it's a completely different thing when it's right in front of you. Even though we've got crazy entertainment now, our social realities are actually a bit more civilized than they were back then, I mean we're not hanging people or whipping them in the street and I think that's positive improvement for any society in my opinion." ...|$|R

Danzig also has a long-standing interest in New World Order related conspiracies: [...] "Not only have I {{always been interested in}} the families that run the world forever, that people know now as the Bilderberg Group. But there’s an older book called The Committee of 300 which tells you all about it.

Well, it turns out it caused more controversy that way with everyone wanting to know who censored it." [...] An alternate version titled [...] "Born to Be Whipped" [...] was recorded with tamer lyrics.
