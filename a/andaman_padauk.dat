5000|$|Pterocarpus dalbergioides, the <b>Andaman</b> <b>padauk,</b> Andaman redwood or East Indian mahogany, is {{a species}} of legume in the Fabaceae family. It is {{sometimes}} called [...] "narra", {{but this is just}} a generic term used for any of several Pterocarpus species.|$|E

50|$|The padauk {{found most}} often is African Padauk from Pterocarpus soyauxii which, when freshly cut, {{is a very}} bright red/orange but when exposed to {{sunlight}} fades over time to a warm brown. Its colour makes it a favourite among woodworkers. Burmese Padauk (ပိတောက်) is Pterocarpus macrocarpus while <b>Andaman</b> <b>Padauk</b> is Pterocarpus dalbergioides. Padauks can be confused with rosewoods {{to which they are}} somewhat related, but as a general rule padauks are coarser and less decorative in figure. Like rosewood, padauk is sometimes used to make xylophone and marimba keys, and guitars. It is an important material in traditional Chinese furniture.|$|E
