40|$|It is well {{recognized}} that alopecia areata (Aa) may preferentially affect pigmented hair and may spare white hair, and that regrowing {{hair in the}} disease is often initially white. In addition, there is an association with vitiligo and ocular depigmentation. To date, the pathomechanisms of the melanocyte effects are unclear. We have studied 10 patients with untreated <b>acute</b> <b>alopecia</b> areata, and three normal patients without hair loss. Morphologic changes, studied by conventional light and electron microscopy, in the cytoplasm of affected melanocytes often predated nuclear hyperchromatism. Increased numbers of bizarre melanosomes were found in affected melanocytes compared with normal ones; such melanosomes had incomplete or “aborted” melanization, resulting in poor pigment deposition, and were disrupted, enlarged and rounded, with loss of normal ellipsoidal shape. An unusual outer root sheath (ORS) distribution of hair bulb melanocytes was seen. Other atypical melanosome effects included marked pigment displacement into peribulbar and DP melanophages. In the DP clumped melanin granules formed giant spherical complexes without discernible limiting membranes, which were sometimes associated with lymphocytes. These morphologic changes indicate an active involvement of hair bulb melanocytes in alopecia areata...|$|E
40|$|The scalp is {{a unique}} site {{of the human body}} that may exhibit some {{particular}} physiopathological reactions. A few manifestations are paroxysmal. The main ones are the acute pruritus of pediculosis, and the pruritus at onset of dandruff or seborrhoeic dermatitis. One must add the telogen effuvium after solar exposure or during the post-partum, and the anagen dystrophic alopecia following chemotherapy. Other paroxysmal events include <b>acute</b> canitia and <b>alopecia</b> areata. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 65 {{children}} with {{acute lymphoblastic leukaemia}} and seven {{with other types of}} acute leukaemia received treatment with a combination of vincristine and prednisone. In all 122 courses of treatment were given. Of 22 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who received this as their first treatment, all achieved complete remission. The complete remission rates were 82 % for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in their first relapse, 63 % in the second relapse, and much lower in subsequent relapses and in the patients with other types of <b>acute</b> leukaemia. <b>Alopecia</b> and gastrointestinal and neuromuscular toxicity occurred respectively in 51 %, 29 %, and 21 % of instances, only the last of these side-effects of vincristine being dose-related. Most of the complete remissions were obtained with a total dose of vincristine which carried only a low risk of neurotoxicity...|$|R
25|$|One-third of {{patients}} have their tumors discovered {{because they have}} an associated autoimmune disorder. As mentioned earlier, {{the most common of}} those conditions is myasthenia gravis (MG); 10–15% {{of patients}} with MG have a thymoma and, conversely, 30–45% of patients with thymomas have MG. Additional associated autoimmune conditions include thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity, pure red cell aplasia and Good syndrome (thymoma with combined immunodeficiency and hypogammaglobulinemia). Other reported disease associations are with <b>acute</b> pericarditis, agranulocytosis, <b>alopecia</b> areata, ulcerative colitis, Cushing's disease, hemolytic anemia, limbic encephalopathy, myocarditis, nephrotic syndrome, panhypopituitarism, pernicious anemia, polymyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, scleroderma, sensorimotor radiculopathy, stiff person syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and thyroiditis.|$|R
40|$|The <b>acute</b> {{phase of}} <b>alopecia</b> areata (AA) is {{characterized}} {{by an increase in}} CD 44 v 3 + and CD 44 v 10 + skin-infiltrating leucocytes (SkIL). Induction of a contact eczema, one of the therapeutic options in AA, can be mitigated strongly by a blockade of CD 44 v 10. The observation that induction of a delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction abrogates an autoimmune reaction, where both responses apparently use similar effector mechanisms, is surprising and prompted us to search for the underlying mechanisms. AA-affected C 3 H/HeJ mice were treated with the contact sensitizer SADBE (squaric acid dibutylester) and leucocyte subpopulations and their activation state was evaluated in SkIL and draining lymph nodes. AA-affected mice exhibited an increased number of SkIL with a predominance of T lymphocytes. After treatment with the contact sensitizer SADBE recovery of SkIL was reduced and monocytes predominated. However, a significantly increased number of leucocytes was recovered from draining lymph nodes. Draining lymph node cells from untreated and treated AA mice exhibited all signs of recent activation with high-level expression of co-stimulatory and accessory molecules and an increased percentage of CD 44 v 3 + and CD 44 v 10 + leucocytes. In contrast, SkIL of SADBE-treated AA mice contained relatively few activated T cells and reduced numbers of CD 44 v 3 + and CD 44 v 10 + cells. Thus, the activation state and the distribution of leucocyte subsets in SADBE-treated AA mice are consistent with a blockade of leucocyte extravasation. Accordingly, the therapeutic effect of long-term SADBE treatment may rely on impaired leucocyte traffic...|$|R
40|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{discovery}} of X-ray treatment in 1895 the new diagnostical and therapeutical possibilities were recognized and used as new aids. Parallel to the diagnostic use in human and veterinary medicine, the biological effect of the X-rays was researched and practiced. The first therapeutical X-ray treatment was practiced by Leopold Freund in 1896. The biological X-rays effects were research firstly on bacteria and protozoon. Richard Eberlein was the first veterinary surgeon who firstly used X-ray therapy on living animals in 1906. Before that, X-rays were only used for diagnosis and animal experiments. Shortly after the first diagnostical and therapeutical application of X-rays on human beings showed radiation damages, mostly skin damage and then later forms of ulcus, carcinoma, sterilization, growth-retarding, blood-changes upto acute radiation sickness were visible. Radiation damages which developped from diagnostical application from X-rays used on animal, were rare. The first radiation damages on veterinary and human staff were mainly <b>acute</b> radio-dermatitis and <b>alopecia,</b> chronical ulcera, deformed nails, leukemia and skin carcinoma which mostly ended lethal for the affected persons. At the outset of X-ray treatment, the consideration of X-ray protection was thought about after somatic damages. In 1927 Müller assessed out the qualitative hereditary damages caused by X-rays. After this discovery X-ray protection refered to genetic damages. Researches in the USA to chronical X-ray damages resulted in 1935 that the life expectancy of radiologists was 10 years lower than the normal population. Until 1944 the leukose rate was additionally 8 times higher on radiologists. Prominent scientists and radiologists died of chronical X-ray damages, for example veterinary surgeons like A. Pommer, E. Becker ect [...] Until 1945 the first X-ray protection measurements were to wear protective clothing and shields, design of the X-ray room, and further the development of X-ray machines and tools, like holders for cassettes or tripods. An important item {{for the development of}} X-ray protection was the use of new measuring instruments to determine the radiation dose. On account of progressive knowledge and technical possibilities, the International X-ray Protection Commission was founded. Today general illness caused by X-rays are very rare because of strict X-ray protection laws, instructions and inspections. However isolated lokal damages on the hands and alterations to the blood are still to be found today. In fact there is probably still a very high number of unreported cases from chronical X-ray damaged persons. At the outset there were very few reports from X-rays damages and protection in specialist literature. In veterinary textbooks for different animals you find very few or rather inexact or inaccurate reports about X-ray protection. Lots of basic english textbooks about X-ray diagnostics have a detailed chapter about the practical and technical X-ray protection. Since the seventies the risk of X-ray load during X-rays in veterinary practices were measured by "Dosimeter". Before 1973 the use of X-rays were not prescribed by law in Germany (BRD). The problems of X-ray protection are different between small and big animals. The reasons are the different mechanical fixations, technical working methods and technical X-ray equipment which must be used individualy. The main principle is the minimum, that says every unnecessary X-ray exposition must be avoided. In addition there is the principle that X-ray dosage to each person must be kept as low as reasonable achievable. When you compare the X-ray protection in GB and USA with german X-ray protection laws and rules, it is to be noted, that there was much earlier procedures. For example in individual federal states in the USA the presence of persons in the controlled area are outlawed. In this literature investigation which covers 100 years, the development of X-ray protection and continued X-ray damages were pursued. Because of careless relations with X-rays, which are not noticeable to our senses, there was time after time damages done to the body. We can find out these damages now but they go mostly undiscovered or unknown so that they don´t appear in public association statistics. The main objective of X-ray protection is to protect individuals and there descendants and the majority of people from harmful X-rays. In spite of this clear objective most veterinary surgeons think that protection is an annoying, unnecessary and time-consuming barrier. But it is clear, that because of the important benefits of using X-rays with justifiable X-ray dosage is obligatory. Through the passing of the new X-ray decree on 18. 06. 2002 X-ray protection became more significant. Through lowering the effective dosage from 15 mSv per year to 6 mSv per year are most of the safety devices like dosage measurement on medical checkups, for veterinary surgeons a controlled defined area. Many practices which don´t have a controlled area because of the small X-ray dosage shoud arrange for one. Further more there should be an specialised knowledge (proficiency certificate) required by law. It is necessary to visit an X-ray protection course every 5 years additional to the license. It is obvious that because of the further development of x-ray protection, the dangers of using X-rays are reduced to a minimum. <br /...|$|R
