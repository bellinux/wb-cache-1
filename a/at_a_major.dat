5|$|I-155 {{was created}} to replace Illinois Route 121 (abbreviated IL121). Prompted by safety {{concerns}} <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> intersection near Morton, state transportation officials replaced the entire route with a limited-access freeway. The interstate was built in several segments from 1970 to 1992, a period that included a ten-year delay due to a lawsuit over right-of-way. I-155 fully opened to traffic on October 29,1992.|$|E
5|$|Over the centuries, {{the book}} has been rebound several times. During an 18th-century rebinding, the pages were rather unsympathetically cropped, with small parts of some {{illustrations}} being lost. The book was also rebound in 1895, but that rebinding broke down quickly. By the late 1920s, several folios had detached completely and were kept separate from the main volume. In 1953, bookbinder Roger Powell rebound the manuscript in four volumes and stretched several pages that had developed bulges. Two volumes can normally be seen displayed at Trinity, one opened <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> decorated page, and one opened to show two text pages with smaller decorations.|$|E

In Verne's earlier works, knowledgeable heroes aim {{to use their}} skills {{to change the world}} for the better; in his later novels, by contrast, scientists and engineers often apply their knowledge toward morally reprehensible projects. The play, by exploring science in both positive and negative lights, shows Verne in transition between the two points of view.|$|E

5|$|After that junction, NY22 bends {{back to the}} north, {{paralleling}} I-684 as a narrow, shaded meandering two-lane rural {{route through}} the Westchester countryside of large wooded lots and houses well-screened from the road. In downtown Bedford, the first settlement since White Plains, the highway overlaps with NY172 for a few blocks, then intersects NY121 at its southern terminus. Route22 itself follows a due-north heading from the hamlet, passing the John Jay Homestead State Historic Site (the first National Historic Landmark along the highway), and Harvey School, before it briefly widens <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> intersection with NY35 near Katonah. Two miles north of that junction, NY22 becomes parallel to I-684 into the Town of Somers and the hamlet of Goldens Bridge. On {{the other side of}} the interstate, accessible via NY138, is the Goldens Bridge train station on Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line, which begins a long parallel alignment with NY22 at this point.|$|E
5|$|At the 2017 World Athletics Championships, Bolt won his heat uncomfortably after a {{slow start}} in 10.07, in his semi-final he {{improved}} to 9.98 but was beaten by Christian Coleman by 0.01. In his final individual race, in the final, Bolt won the Bronze medal in 9.95, 0.01 behind Silver medalist Coleman and 0.03 behind World Champion Justin Gatlin. It {{was the first time}} Bolt had been beaten <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> championship since the 4x100m relay of the 2007 World Athletics Championships. Also at the 2017 World Athletics Championships, Bolt participated as the anchor runner for Jamaica's 4x100-meter relay team. In what many expected would be his final race, Bolt collapsed to the track after an apparent hamstring injury. He refused to get in a wheelchair and crossed the finish line with the assistance of his teammates.|$|E
5|$|At the US Open, Murray {{entered a}} Grand Slam tournament as {{defending}} champion {{for the first}} time, and started strongly with a straight sets win against Michaël Llodra. He backed this up with wins over Leonardo Mayer, Florian Mayer and Denis Istomin to reach the quarterfinals <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> for the 11th straight tournament. In the last 8, Murray faced Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland, but lost in straight sets, ending Murray's streak of four consecutive major finals. Following his disappointing run of form on hard courts, Murray next joined the Great Britain Davis Cup team in their World Group Play-off tie on clay against Croatia, where he played in two singles and the doubles rubbers. After defeating 16-year-old Borna Ćorić in straight sets, Murray teamed up with Colin Fleming to defeat Croatian number 1 Ivan Dodig and Mate Pavić in the doubles, and take a 2–1 lead in the tie. Murray then sealed Britain's return to the World Group by defeating Dodig in straight sets.|$|E

5|$|City have {{previously}} worn three other badges on their shirts, {{prior to their}} current badge which was implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the current badge, inside a circle bearing {{the name of the}} club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced {{the lower half of the}} shield with the red rose of Lancashire. On occasions when Manchester City plays in a major cup final, the usual badge has not been used; instead shirts bearing a badge of the arms of the City of Manchester are used, as a symbol of pride in representing the city of Manchester <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> event. This practice originates from a time when the players' shirts did not normally bear a badge of any kind, but has continued throughout the history of the club. For the 2011 FA Cup Final, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on the back of players' shirts.|$|E
5|$|Djokovic is {{the only}} player besides Nadal to defeat Federer in {{consecutive}} Grand Slam tournaments (2010 US Open and 2011 Australian Open), and the only player besides Nadal and Murray who has double-figure career wins over Federer. Djokovic {{is one of four}} players currently on tour to have defeated Federer in straight sets <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Major</b> and the only player to do it three times. Between 2007–2011 they played a record five times at the US Open (tied with Lendl–McEnroe and Connors–Lendl), with Federer winning the first three and Djokovic the last two. This includes the 2010 and 2011 semifinals they contested, in both of which Djokovic saved two match points before going on to win the match. In contrast Federer {{is the only}} player beside Nadal to have achieved 20 career wins against Djokovic and ended Djokovic's 43-match winning streak and 41–0 start to the 2011 season, by defeating him in the French Open semifinals. These three matches have been classified among the greatest matches in tennis history by the ATP.|$|E
5|$|Federer triumphed in five sets {{despite being}} a break down {{early in the}} {{deciding}} 5th set. This {{was the first time}} Federer won a major since Wimbledon in 2012, the first time he defeated Nadal <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> since the Wimbledon final of 2007, and the first time that Federer defeated Nadal in a Grand Slam match outside the grass courts of Wimbledon. With this win, Federer increased his all-time record to 18 major titles, became the oldest man to win a Grand Slam tournament, at age 35, since Ken Rosewall at the Australian Open in 1972, and became the first ever man to win at least 5 singles majors in 3 different Grand Slam tournaments each.|$|E

At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London he threw 82.63 and finished sixth which became fifth several years later after disqualification of the original silver medalist Oleksandr Pyatnytsya for doping offence. Next year's World Championships at Moscow brought Thorkildsen a sixth place with a throw of 81.06 in {{what turned out to}} be his last appearance <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> championship competition. Injuries forced him to bring his 2014 season to a premature end before the European Championships. He later decided to sit out the entire 2015 season but aimed at comeback in 2016. However, in May 2016 Thorkildsen announced his retirement from sports.|$|E
5|$|Rajoelina's {{business}} affairs gradually {{drew him}} into the political arena. Shortly after Ravalomanana won the presidential elections in 2001, Rajoelina befriended the new president's daughter and continued to expand {{his relationship with the}} capital's political elite {{over the course of the}} Ravalomanana presidency. He assumed an increasingly political role after the policies of Ravalomanana's Tiako I Madagasikara (TIM)-dominated government increasingly obstructed the expansion of his business activities, such as requiring the removal of Antananarivo's first LED advertising panels, which Rajoelina had installed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> roundabout in the capital. In May 2007 he purchased the Ravinala television and radio stations, which he renamed Viva TV and Viva FM. The official launch of these newly acquired media channels on 27 May was attended by many of the capital's political and cultural elite, including Antananarivo mayor Hery Rafalimanana and Jacques Sylla, president of the TIM political party. Rajoelina used these media channels as outlets for voicing criticism of the Ravalomanana administration, quickly transforming his public image into that of an opposition leader.|$|E
5|$|Taonere Banda was {{the first}} Malawian Paralympic athlete to compete at the quadrennial event. She {{qualified}} for the games by using a wildcard because the country {{did not have any}} athletes who met the qualification standards. Banda spent the 60 days in the buildup to Rio training for the event, but amenities in Malawi were imperfect and she trained on a dusty, uneven running track without standard defined lanes. She stated that it had been her childhood ambition to represent Malawi <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> international sporting event and this was her sole opportunity to prove her athletic abilities in her event, the 1500 metres (T13). Banda was drawn in the first heat on 8 September. She attacked the first lap aggressively taking up a commanding lead, but her initial speed saw her tire in the latter stages and she lost the lead in the last 600 metres of the race to finish fourth. Banda was later disqualified when she was observed to leave her lane during the heat. Nevertheless, she said that when she returned to Malawi, she would encourage people with disabilities to work hard and participate in sporting events.|$|E

5|$|The 2012 US Open Men's singles final was the {{championship}} tennis match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 2012 US Open. It pitted then-world No. 3 Andy Murray against world No. 2 and defending champion Novak Djokovic in a Grand Slam tournament final {{for the second}} time. Murray defeated Djokovic in five sets to win the match. It was the equal-longest US Open men's final in history, lasting four hours and fifty-four minutes (equalling the 1988 US Open final played by Ivan Lendl and Mats Wilander), and the equal second-longest men's final in the Open era, only behind the aforementioned 2012 Australian Open final. By winning the 2012 US Open, Murray became the first British man since Fred Perry in 1936 to win a Grand Slam singles title, and the first British man in the Open Era to do so. This was the most famous match in the rivalry between the two players. It also marked a milestone for Murray, as it was his 100th match win <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Major.</b>|$|E
5|$|Thorpe began {{competition}} in 2002 at the Australian Championships in Brisbane in March, which {{were used to}} select the team for the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester and the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships. After his record six gold medals in Fukuoka, the meet was surrounded by further expectations of world records and speculation that he would match Spitz's seven gold medals. His winning time in the 400m was the second fastest in history, but such was the expectation on him that his failure to break a world record was the talking point. He claimed the 100m and 200m events in times outside his best, making {{it the first time}} that he had failed to break a world record <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> meet since 1999. He also experimented by adding the 100m backstroke to his repertoire, placing second. This earned him a Commonwealth spot in a seventh event, leading to further media speculation that he could match Spitz.|$|E
5|$|In the 2017 Rogers Cup, held in Montreal, Nadal had {{a chance}} to regain the ATP No. 1 ranking if he made the semi-finals; however, he lost in the 3rd round to Canadian {{teenager}} Denis Shapovalov. Federer progressed to the final, where he lost to Alexander Zverev and sustained an injury during the second set. Due to the renewed back injury, Federer then pulled out of the 2017 Cincinnati Masters, leaving Nadal as the only Big Four player competing there and allowing him to reclaim the ATP No. 1 ranking. In the 2017 Cincinnati Masters, Nadal was knocked out by Nick Kyrgios in the quarter-finals, breaking the streak of 42 consecutive Big Four appearances in Masters 1000 semi-finals and finals. At the US Open, Nadal was be seeded first (for the first time <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> since 2014), Murray second, and Federer, who is only 5 points behind Murray, third. The 2017 US Open would also be the first major Djokovic has missed after a streak of 51 consecutive appearances. Furthermore, Murray ultimately pulled out of the US Open, having not recovered from his hip injury suffered during Wimbledon, leaving just Nadal and Federer as the only Big Four players remaining in the draw. With this withdrawal, Murray would fall out of the top 2 {{for the first time since}} May 2016. Nadal made the semi-finals, while Federer lost in the quarter-finals to Juan Martin del Potro. This loss ended Federer's undefeated record in Grand Slam matches during 2017, and also marked the sixth time that both Federer and Nadal came within one match of meeting each other at the US Open, but did not do so due to one of them losing. This phenomenon previously occurred at the semi-finals of all US Opens between 2008 and 2011, and in the fourth round of the 2013 tournament. Nadal then defeated Del Potro to reach his first US Open final since 2013, and defeated Kevin Anderson in the final to win his third US Open title.|$|E
