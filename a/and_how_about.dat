500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, writing [...] "Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka {{may be a}} stone freak, but he is {{also one}} of Burton's classic crackpot conjurers, like Beetlejuice or Ed Wood." [...] Roger Ebert gave an overall {{positive}} review and enjoyed the film. He was primarily impressed by Tim Burton's direction of the younger cast members, but was disappointed with Depp's performance: [...] "What was Depp thinking of? In [...] he was famously channeling Keith Richards, which may have primed us to look for possible inspirations for this performance." [...] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle found Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Burton's [...] "best work in years. If all the laughs come from Depp, who gives Willy the mannerisms of a classic Hollywood diva, the film's heart comes from Highmore, a gifted young performer whose performance is sincere, deep and unforced in a way that's rare in a child actor." [...] Peter Travers wrote in Rolling Stone magazine that [...] "Depp's deliciously demented take on Willy Wonka demands to be seen. Depp goes deeper to find the bruises on Wonka's secret heart than what Gene Wilder did. Depp and Burton may fly too high on the vapors of pure imagination, but it's hard to not get hooked on something this tasty. <b>And</b> <b>how</b> <b>about</b> that army of Oompa-Loompas, all played by Deep Roy, in musical numbers that appear to have been choreographed by Busby Berkeley on crack." ...|$|E

However, if a bishop may lawfully crack a man's head, as an eggshell, I see not that blame can attach to me, a humble and most unworthy son of the church, if some slight harm should come to any man, from the use of so peaceful an instrument as a staff. <b>And</b> <b>how</b> <b>about</b> yourself, young master?" ...|$|E

I wondered at his sending me so suddenly, and, feeling uneasy, rode there post-haste, saw the steward last night, and started again on a fresh horse this morning. This accounts for it. He knew that if I were there nothing would have induced me to separate myself from him, while by sending me away he left it to me to do as I thought fit afterwards, trusting that when I found that he was already imprisoned I might follow the counsel he had urged upon me, to make my escape from the country. <b>And</b> <b>how</b> <b>about</b> the ladies, how about Marie?" ...|$|E
