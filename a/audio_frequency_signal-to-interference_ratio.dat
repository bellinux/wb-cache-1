30|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{considerable}} interest in the theory and design of filter bank transceivers due to their superior frequency response. In many applications, it is desired to have transceivers that can support multiple services with different incoming data rates and different quality-of-service requirements. To meet these requirements, we can either do resource allocation or design transceivers with a nonuniform bandwidth partition. In this paper, we propose a method {{for the design of}} nonuniform filter bank transceivers for frequency selective channels. Both <b>frequency</b> response and <b>signal-to-interference</b> <b>ratio</b> (SIR) can be incorporated in the transceiver design. Moreover, the technique can be extended to the case of nonuniform filter bank transceivers with rational sampling factors. Simulation results show that nonuniform filter bank transceivers with good filter responses as well as high SIR can be obtained by the proposed design method.|$|R

The {{cellular}} telephone success story prompts the wireless communications community to turn {{its attention to}} other information services, {{many of them in}} the category of “wireless data ” communications. One lesson of {{cellular telephone}} network operation is that effective power control is essential to promote system quality and efficiency. In recent we have applied microeconomic theories to power control taking into account notions of utility and pricing.
