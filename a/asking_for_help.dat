One day, van Kempen returns to the Netherlands, leaving Siti and their young mixed-race children behind. In the Netherlands he marries a young widow and takes her daughter, Ervine, as his step-daughter.

5|$|Anna Beauchamp {{joined her}} husband in his cell in the dungeon; the only entry was through a trap door {{at the top of}} the room. During their incarceration, they tried to bribe a guard into {{allowing}} them to escape. When that failed, they tried to pass a letter to Senator Beauchamp <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> to escape, an attempt which likewise failed. Both the senator and the younger Beauchamp asked for a pardon from Governor Desha, but to no avail. Beauchamp's final request to Desha for a stay of execution was rejected July 5, 1826. With the last hope exhausted, the couple attempted a double suicide by drinking a vial of laudanum which Anna had smuggled into the cell. Both survived. The following morning, Jereboam and Anna were put on suicide watch and threatened with separation.|$|E

As the virus spread, it affected not only humans, but other animals as well, and the environment deteriorated, turning cities into desolate landscapes and the wilderness into wastelands. The real Alice (from whom the clones are made) wanders the wastelands of the Southwestern U.S. She responds to a group <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> on the radio.

40|$|This paper studied whether {{threats to}} {{self-esteem}} and goal orientation affected an individual?s propensity to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>help.</b> Eighty-two undergraduate {{students from the}} University of Waterloo completed a self-esteem and goal orientation questionnaire in addition to completing two tests. One test {{was designed to be}} more self-relevant than the other, making that test more potentially threatening to an individual?s self-esteem. In each test, subjects were given the opportunity to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>help</b> on each question. The results show that the use of social comparison motivates individuals to engage in self-protection by reducing their willingness to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>help.</b> In situations where many others had <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>help,</b> help seeking behavior increased. These results extend other research in showing the impact of social comparison on individual behaviour...|$|R

Whitney and Carol argue over Connor, and Whitney feels she is not wanted by her family so decides to move out, and stays with Ryan's estranged wife Janine Malloy (Charlie Brooks). Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) offers Whitney a work trial at The Vic for a job, but catches her giving free drinks to Janine. Despite this, she lets Whitney off, telling her she is a natural, and works well at the till. When Kat catches her stealing again, she sacks Whitney, leaving Janine angry with Whitney. After Whitney sees Janine successfully pickpocket someone, she decides to try it herself, but ends up being hit in the face. A man called Rob Grayson (Jody Latham) helps her, buys her food and returns her to Albert Square, giving her his phone number. Whitney tries to kiss Max, causing her to fall out with Lauren. She also argues with Carol, rejects Ricky and is rejected by Liam, Tiffany and Morgan for ruining Ricky's birthday cake days earlier. Upset, Whitney contacts Rob and asks to stay with him, which he accepts. She throws her phone away and tells nobody that she is going. Janine lies about Whitney's whereabouts but when she admits she does not know where Whitney is, Lauren and Janine attempt to find her, and Lauren sees her in Dartford going into a club. Lauren goes back with her to her bedsit, but Whitney does not want to go, saying she and Rob are in love. Lauren is then thrown out by Rob. Whitney has sex with a man called Chris (Richard Simons) and it is revealed that Whitney has been having sex with Rob's friends to pay off his debts to them.

Whitney tells Rob she wants to leave, but he says to either be nice to his friends or he will hurt her. He locks her in a room so she breaks the window and escapes, stopping a car and <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>help,</b> while Rob shouts after her.|$|E

25|$|The line of British kings {{continues}} under Roman rule, {{and includes}} Lucius, Britain's first Christian king, and several Roman figures, including the emperor Constantine I, the usurper Allectus {{and the military}} commander Asclepiodotus.

In desperation the Britons send letters to the general of the Roman forces, <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>help,</b> but receive no reply (this passage borrows heavily from the corresponding section in Gildas' De Excidio Britanniae).|$|E

Another defense tactic involved Constantine blocking off the port so that the Ottoman army could not get ships into it. Mehmed had his people pave a path from oiled tree branches in order to bring eighty ships overland, and placed them into the gulf behind the enemy ships.

25|$|The same day, Colquhoun Grant's cavalry brigade {{consisting}} of the 10th, 15th, and 18th Hussar Regiments defeated a French cavalry force at Morales de Toro. The French mounted troops comprised the 16th and 21st Dragoon Regiments under Pierre Benoît Soult and their horses were in very bad condition. The 16th was virtually destroyed, with two officers and 308 troopers being made prisoners; of these 100 were wounded. British casualties in the clash were only 16 killed and wounded. On 3 June, Hill's wing joined Graham on the north bank of the Douro at Toro. At this time, Wellington had 90,000 troops concentrated while the French could only count 51,000 men.
