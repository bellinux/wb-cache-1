5|$|A 2016 {{systematic}} review examined antioxidant medications, such as <b>allopurinol</b> and acetylcysteine, as add on treatment for schizophrenia. Evidence was insufficient to determine benefits {{and there was}} potential for adverse effects.|$|E
5|$|Febuxostat is {{typically}} only recommended {{in those who}} cannot tolerate <b>allopurinol.</b> Probenecid appears to be less effective than <b>allopurinol</b> and is a second line agent. Probenecid may be used if undersecretion of uric acid is present (24-hour urine uric acid less than 800mg). It is, however, not recommended if a person {{has a history of}} kidney stones. Pegloticase is an option for the 3% of people who are intolerant to other medications. It is a third line agent. Pegloticase is administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks, and reduces uric acid levels. Pegloticase is useful decreasing tophi but has a high rate of side effects and many people develop resistance to it. In 2016 it was withdrawn from the European market.|$|E
5|$|In {{those who}} have had stones, {{prevention}} is by drinking fluids such that more than two liters of urine are produced per day. If this is not effective enough, thiazide diuretic, citrate, or <b>allopurinol</b> may be taken. It is recommended that soft drinks containing phosphoric acid (typically colas) be avoided.|$|E
5|$|Treatment with nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs), steroids, or colchicine improves symptoms. Once {{the acute}} attack subsides, levels of uric acid can be lowered via lifestyle changes {{and in those}} with frequent attacks, <b>allopurinol</b> or probenecid provides long-term prevention. Taking vitamin C and eating a diet high in low fat dairy products may be preventive.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{are useful for}} preventing further episodes of gout, including <b>allopurinol,</b> febuxostat, and probenecid. Long term medications are not recommended until a person has had two attacks of gout, unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or urate nephropathy exist. It is not until this point that medications are cost-effective. They are not usually started until one to two weeks after an acute flare has resolved, due to theoretical concerns of worsening the attack. They are often used in combination with either an NSAID or colchicine {{for the first three}} to six months.|$|E
5|$|The initial aim of {{treatment}} is {{to settle the}} symptoms of an acute attack. Repeated attacks can be prevented by medications that reduce serum uric acid levels. Tentative evidence supports the application of ice for 20 to 30 minutes {{several times a day}} to decrease pain. Options for acute treatment include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine and steroids. While steroids and NSAIDs work equally well, steroids may be safer. Options for prevention include <b>allopurinol,</b> febuxostat, and probenecid. Lowering uric acid levels can cure the disease. Treatment of associated health problems is also important. Lifestyle interventions have been poorly studied. It is unclear whether dietary supplements have an effect in people with gout.|$|E
5|$|The {{triggers}} for precipitation of {{uric acid}} {{are not well}} understood. While it may crystallize at normal levels, {{it is more likely}} to do so as levels increase. Other triggers believed to be important in acute episodes of arthritis include cool temperatures, rapid changes in uric acid levels, acidosis, articular hydration and extracellular matrix proteins, such as proteoglycans, collagens and chondroitin sulfate. The increased precipitation at low temperatures partly explains why the joints in the feet are most commonly affected. Rapid changes in uric acid may occur due to factors including trauma, surgery, chemotherapy, diuretics and stopping or starting <b>allopurinol.</b> Calcium channel blockers and losartan are associated with a lower risk of gout compared to other medications for hypertension.|$|E
25|$|It is {{essential}} that the overproduction of uric acid be controlled {{in order to reduce}} the risk of nephropathy, nephrolithiasis, and gouty arthritis. The drug <b>allopurinol</b> is utilized to stop the conversion of oxypurines into uric acid, and prevent the development of subsequent arthritic tophi (produced after having chronic gout), kidney stones, and nephropathy, the resulting kidney disease. <b>Allopurinol</b> is taken orally, at a typical dose of 3–20mg/kg per day. The dose is then adjusted to bring the uric acid level down into the normal range (<3nbsp&mg/dL). Most affected individuals can be treated with <b>allopurinol</b> all through life.|$|E
25|$|Other purine analogues such as <b>allopurinol</b> inhibit {{xanthine}} oxidase, {{the enzyme}} that breaks down azathioprine, thus increasing the toxicity of azathioprine. On the other hand, low doses of <b>allopurinol</b> {{have been shown}} to safely enhance the efficacy of azathioprine, especially in inflammatory bowel disease non-responders. This may still lead to lower lymphocyte counts and higher rates of infection, therefore the combination requires careful monitoring.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} {{caused by}} the buildup of uric acid (gout and renal symptoms) respond well to treatment with drugs such as <b>allopurinol</b> that reduce the levels of uric acid in the blood. Lesch Nyhan Syndrome does not respond to <b>allopurinol</b> treatment. The mental deficits and self-mutilating behavior do not respond well to treatment. There is no cure, but many patients live to adulthood. Several new experimental treatments may alleviate symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Heterozygous females can be {{difficult}} to diagnose. With the rise of sequencing techniques, molecular testing has become preferred, particularly when the disease causing mutations in the family are known. Historically, heterozygous females were often diagnosed using an <b>allopurinol</b> challenge. In a female with reduced enzyme activity, an oral dose of <b>allopurinol</b> would be metabolized to oxypurinol ribonucleotide, which blocks the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. When this induced enzymatic block is combined with reduced physiologic enzyme activity as seen in heterozygotes, the elevation of orotic acid could be used to differentiate heterozygotes from unaffected individuals. This test was not universally effective, as it had both false negative and false positive results.|$|E
25|$|Treatment for LNS is symptomatic. Gout can {{be treated}} with <b>allopurinol</b> to control {{excessive}} amounts of uric acid. Kidney stones may be treated with lithotripsy, a technique for breaking up kidney stones using shock waves or laser beams. There is no standard treatment for the neurological symptoms of LNS. Some may be relieved with the drugs carbidopa/levodopa, diazepam, phenobarbital, or haloperidol.|$|E
25|$|Although current {{treatments}} can {{be administered}} {{in a controlled}} hospital setting, many hospitals are ill-suited for a situation involving mass casualties among civilians. Inexpensive positive-pressure devices {{that can be used}} easily in a mass casualty situation, and drugs to prevent inflammation and pulmonary edema are needed. Several drugs that have been approved by the FDA for other indications hold promise for treating chemically induced pulmonary edema. These include β2-agonists, dopamine, insulin, <b>allopurinol,</b> and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen. Ibuprofen is particularly appealing because it has an established safety record and can be easily administered as an initial intervention. Inhaled and systemic forms of β2-agonists used in the treatment of asthma and other commonly used medications, such as insulin, dopamine, and <b>allopurinol</b> have also been effective in reducing pulmonary edema in animal models but require further study. A recent study documented in the AANA Journal discussed the use of volatile anesthetic agents, such as sevoflurane, {{to be used as a}} bronchodilator that lowered peak airway pressures and improved oxygenation. Other promising drugs in earlier stages of development act at various steps in the complex molecular pathways underlying pulmonary edema. Some of these potential drugs target the inflammatory response or the specific site(s) of injury. Others modulate the activity of ion channels that control fluid transport across lung membranes or target surfactant, a substance that lines the air sacs in the lungs and prevents them from collapsing. Mechanistic information based on toxicology, biochemistry, and physiology may be instrumental in determining new targets for therapy. Mechanistic studies may also aid in the development of new diagnostic approaches. Some chemicals generate metabolic byproducts that could be used for diagnosis, but detection of these byproducts may not be possible until many hours after initial exposure. Additional research must be directed at developing sensitive and specific tests to identify individuals quickly after they have been exposed to varying levels of chemicals toxic to the respiratory tract.|$|E
25|$|There has {{previously}} been no effective method of treatment for the neurobehavioral aspects of the disease. Even children treated from birth with <b>allopurinol</b> develop behavioral and neurologic problems, despite never having had high serum concentrations of uric acid. Self-injurious and other behaviors are best managed {{by a combination of}} medical, physical, and behavioral interventions. The self-mutilation is often reduced by using restraints. Sixty percent of individuals have their teeth extracted in order to avoid self-injury, which families have found to be an effective management technique. Because stress increases self-injury, behavioral management through aversive techniques (which would normally reduce self-injury) actually increases self-injury in individuals with LNS. Nearly all affected individuals need restraints to prevent self-injury, and are restrained more than 75% of the time. This is often at their own request, and occasionally involves restraints that would appear to be ineffective, as they do not physically prevent biting. Families report that affected individuals are more at ease when restrained.|$|E
25|$|Dupuytren's contracture, {{a disease}} of the fasciae in the palm and fingers that {{permanently}} bends the fingers (usually the little and ring fingers) toward the palm, was first noted to be highly prevalent in epileptic people in 1941 by a Dr. Lund, fourteen years before primidone was on the market. Lund also noted that it was equally prevalent in individuals with idiopathic and symptomatic epilepsy and that {{the severity of the}} epilepsy did not matter. However, only one quarter of the women were affected vs. half of the men. Thirty-five years later, Critcheley et al. reported a correlation between how long a patient had had epilepsy and his or her chance of getting Dupuytren's contracture. They suspected that this was due to phenobarbital therapy, and that the phenobarbital was stimulating peripheral tissue growth factors. Dupuytren's contracture is almost exclusively found in Caucasians, especially those of Viking descent, and highest rates are reported in Northern Scotland, Norway, Iceland, and Australia. It has also been associated with alcoholism, heavy smoking, diabetes mellitus, physical trauma (either penetrating in nature or due to manual labor), tuberculosis, and HIV. People with rheumatoid arthritis are less likely to get this, and Drs. Hart and Hooper speculate that this is also true of gout due to the use of <b>allopurinol</b> This is the only susceptibility factor that is generally agreed upon. Anticonvulsants do not seem to increase the incidence of Dupuytren's contracture in non-whites.|$|E
500|$|While {{historically}} it is {{not recommended}} to start <b>allopurinol</b> during an acute attack of gout, this practice appears okay. <b>Allopurinol</b> blocks uric acid production, and is {{the most commonly used}} agent. Long term therapy is safe and well tolerated, and can be used in people with renal impairment or urate stones, although hypersensitivity occurs in a small number of individuals.|$|E
500|$|Not all {{irreversible}} inhibitors form covalent adducts {{with their}} enzyme targets. Some reversible inhibitors bind so tightly to their target enzyme {{that they are}} essentially irreversible. These tight-binding inhibitors may show kinetics similar to covalent irreversible inhibitors. In these cases, some of these inhibitors rapidly bind to the enzyme in a low-affinity EI complex and this then undergoes a slower rearrangement to a very tightly bound EI* complex (see figure above). This kinetic behaviour is called slow-binding. This slow rearrangement after binding often involves a conformational change as the enzyme [...] "clamps down" [...] around the inhibitor molecule. Examples of slow-binding inhibitors include some important drugs, such methotrexate, <b>allopurinol,</b> and the activated form of acyclovir.|$|E

Clozapine users in the United States, Australia, Canada, and the UK must be nationally registered for monitoring of low WBC and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC).|$|E
50|$|<b>Allopurinol</b> {{inhibits}} xanthine oxidase, {{the enzyme}} that breaks down mercaptopurine. Those taking <b>allopurinol</b> (often {{used to prevent}} gout) {{are at risk for}} mercaptopurine toxicity. The dose should be reduced or <b>allopurinol</b> should be discontinued.Several published studies have demonstrated that the use of <b>allopurinol</b> in combination with low dose 6-MP helps reduce 6-MP levels, which are toxic to liver tissue, whilst increasing the therapeutic levels of 6-MP for some inflammatory conditions.|$|E
50|$|More rarely, <b>allopurinol</b> {{can also}} {{result in the}} {{depression}} of bone marrow elements, leading to cytopenias, as well as aplastic anemia. Moreover, <b>allopurinol</b> can also cause peripheral neuritis in some patients, although this is a rare side effect. Another side effect of <b>allopurinol</b> is interstitial nephritis.|$|E
5000|$|HLA-B*5801 is {{involved}} in <b>allopurinol</b> sensitive drug induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome. [...] <b>Allopurinol</b> is a frequent cause of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including drug-hypersensitivity syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN). The association with <b>allopurinol</b> sensitivity in JSJ/TEN was extremely strong in Asia, and somewhat less associated in Europeans.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>allopurinol</b> {{is not a}} uricosuric, {{it can be used}} {{in people}} with poor kidney function. However, <b>allopurinol</b> has two {{important}} disadvantages.|$|E
50|$|<b>Allopurinol</b> {{hypersensitivity}} syndrome typically occurs in persons with preexisting kidney failure. Weeks to months after <b>allopurinol</b> is begun, the patient develops a morbilliform eruption.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Allopurinol</b> {{has been}} marketed in the United States since August 19, 1966, {{when it was}} first {{approved}} by FDA under the trade name Zyloprim. [...] <b>Allopurinol</b> was marketed at the time by Burroughs-Wellcome. <b>Allopurinol</b> is now a generic drug sold under a variety of brand names, including Allohexal, Allosig, Milurit, Alloril, Progout, Ürikoliz, Zyloprim, Zyloric, Zyrik, and Aluron.|$|E
50|$|In the UK, NICE {{has found}} that febuxostat has a higher cost/benefit ratio than <b>allopurinol</b> and on that basis {{recommended}} febuxostat as a second-line drug for people who cannot use <b>allopurinol.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Allopurinol</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} and reported in 1956 by Roland K. Robins (1926-1992), {{in a search}} for antineoplastic agents. [...] Because <b>allopurinol</b> inhibits the breakdown (catabolism) of the thiopurine drug mercaptopurine, and it was later tested by Wayne Rundles, in collaboration with Gertrude Elion's lab at Wellcome Research Laboratories to see if it could improve treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia by enhancing the action of mercaptopurine. [...] However, no improvement in leukemia response was noted with mercaptopurine-allopurinol co-therapy, so that work turned to other compounds and the team then started testing <b>allopurinol</b> as a potential for gout. [...] <b>Allopurinol</b> was first marketed as a treatment for gout in 1966.|$|E
5000|$|Febuxostat is used {{to treat}} chronic gout and hyperuricemia. [...] National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence {{concluded}} that febuxostat {{is more effective than}} standard doses of <b>allopurinol,</b> but not more effective than higher doses of <b>allopurinol.</b>|$|E
50|$|A common {{misconception}} is that <b>allopurinol</b> is metabolized by its target, xanthine oxidase, {{but this}} action is principally {{carried out by}} aldehyde oxidase. The active metabolite of <b>allopurinol</b> is oxipurinol, which is also an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. <b>Allopurinol</b> is almost completely metabolized to oxipurinol within two hours of oral administration, whereas oxipurinol is slowly excreted by the kidneys over 18-30 hours. For this reason, oxipurinol is believed responsible {{for the majority of}} allopurinol's effect.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Allopurinol,</b> {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of chronic gout, can be synthesized starting with a Knoevenagel condensation with triethyl orthoformate; the condensation product is cyclized with hydrazine to give a substituted pyrazole and subsequently with formamide to <b>allopurinol,</b> a substituted pyrazolo-pyrimidine.|$|E

50|$|Because {{xanthine}} oxidase is a metabolic pathway for uric acid formation, the {{xanthine oxidase}} inhibitor <b>allopurinol</b> {{is used in}} the treatment of gout.
