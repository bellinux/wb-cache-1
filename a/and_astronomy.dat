5|$|In 1589, he was {{appointed}} to the chair of mathematics in Pisa. In 1591, his father died, and he was entrusted with the care of his younger brother Michelagnolo. In 1592, he moved to the University of Padua where he taught geometry, mechanics, <b>and</b> <b>astronomy</b> until 1610. During this period, Galileo made significant discoveries in both pure fundamental science (for example, kinematics of motion <b>and</b> <b>astronomy)</b> as well as practical applied science (for example, strength of materials and pioneering the telescope). His multiple interests included the study of astrology, which at the time was a discipline tied to the studies of mathematics <b>and</b> <b>astronomy.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{design for}} Stars was likely {{influenced}} by Escher's own interest in both geometry <b>and</b> <b>astronomy,</b> {{by a long}} history of using geometric forms to model the heavens, and by a drawing style used by Leonardo da Vinci. Commentators have interpreted the cage's compound shape as a reference to double and triple stars in astronomy, or to twinned crystals in crystallography. The image contrasts the celestial order of its polyhedral shapes with the more chaotic forms of biology.|$|E

In January 2016, in recognition that his actual name was Lipperhey (with Lippershey an error introduced in the 19th century), the exoplanet name was corrected to Lipperhey by the IAU and that name was submitted to the official sites that keep track of astronomical information.|$|E
5|$|Intellectually, Scott {{and figures}} like Thomas Carlyle {{played a part}} in the {{development}} of historiography and the idea of the historical imagination. Romanticism also influenced science, particularly the life sciences, geology, optics <b>and</b> <b>astronomy,</b> giving Scotland a prominence in these areas that continued into the late nineteenth century. Scottish philosophy was dominated by Scottish Common Sense Realism, which shared some characteristics with Romanticism and was a major influence on the development of Transcendentalism. Scott also played a major part in defining Scottish and British politics, helping to create a romanticised view of Scotland and the Highlands that fundamentally changed Scottish national identity.|$|E
