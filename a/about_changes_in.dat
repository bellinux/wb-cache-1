5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Reformation brought <b>about</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the {{governance}} of the cathedrals as discussed below. Some existent buildings became cathedrals at this time. Several of the buildings were structurally damaged or left incomplete because of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, 1537–40. Many of the large abbey churches, particularly those outside the towns, were robbed, burnt out and abandoned. The late 16th and early 17th centuries saw repairs to the fabric of many cathedrals and some new building and stained glass {{as well as many}} new fittings.|$|E
5|$|Ecology surged {{in popular}} and {{scientific}} interest during the 1960–1970s environmental movement. There are strong historical and scientific ties between ecology, environmental management, and protection. The historical emphasis and poetic naturalistic writings advocating {{the protection of}} wild places by notable ecologists {{in the history of}} conservation biology, such as Aldo Leopold and Arthur Tansley, have been seen as far removed from urban centres where, it is claimed, the concentration of pollution and environmental degradation is located. Palamar (2008) notes an overshadowing by mainstream environmentalism of pioneering women in the early 1900s who fought for urban health ecology (then called euthenics) and brought <b>about</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> environmental legislation. Women such as Ellen Swallow Richards and Julia Lathrop, among others, were precursors to the more popularized environmental movements after the 1950s.|$|E

Webb has stated that he tackled these subjects to stimulate discussion and engage people to bring <b>about</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> {{what he sees as}} some of the greatest problems the world is facing today. In order to broaden this discussion to people less inclined to purchase his album, beginning September 1, 2006, Webb offered Mockingbird for free on the website Free Derek Webb (no longer exists), where it was available for download until December 8, 2006. Over 80,000 free copies of the album were downloaded during this time.|$|E

There was only one good study comparing implanting implants in both ears at the same time, to implanting them sequentially; this study found that in the sequential approach, the 2nd implantation made no change, or made things worse.|$|E
25|$|The Mongols brought <b>about</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the {{economic}} power {{of states and}} overall trade. In the religious sphere, St. Paphnutius of Borovsk was the grandson of a Mongol baskak, or tax collector, while a nephew of Khan Bergai of the Golden Horde converted to Christianity and {{became known as the}} monk St. Peter Tsarevich of the Horde. In the judicial sphere, under Mongol influence capital punishment, which during the times of Kievan Rus' had only been applied to slaves, became widespread, and the use of torture became a regular part of criminal procedure. Specific punishments introduced in Moscow included beheading for alleged traitors and branding of thieves (with execution for a third arrest).|$|E

25|$|However, the {{reorganisation}} {{of states}} in India on linguistic basis removed Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam speaking regions from the Madras Presidency {{leaving behind a}} predominantly Tamil Madras State. Giving in to realities, Annadurai and his DMK changed the call of independent Dravida Nadu for Dravidians to independent Tamil Nadu for Tamils. Annadurai felt that remaining in the Indian Union meant accepting linguistic domination and economic backwardness. Nevertheless, the Sino-Indian war brought <b>about</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the Indian constitution. The Sixteenth Amendment (most popularly known as the Anti-Secessionist Amendment) banned any party with sectarian principles from participating in elections. When this amendment was presented in the Parliament of India, Annadurai was one of its members. He vehemently debated against the amendment, but eventually could not stop it from being passed. Faced with the new constitutional changes, Annadurai and his DMK left the call for an independent Tamil homeland on the back burner.|$|E
500|$|The speech {{received}} [...] "relatively little {{coverage from}} the media", Time magazine claimed 20 years later. John Kornblum, senior US diplomat in Berlin {{at the time}} of Reagan's speech, and US Ambassador to Germany from 1997 to 2001, said [...] " [...] wasn't really elevated to its current status until 1989, after the wall came down." [...] The muted response in the Western media contrasted with the reaction from the East: East German Politburo member Günter Schabowski considered the speech to be [...] "absurd", and the Soviet press agency TASS accused Reagan of giving an [...] "openly provocative, war-mongering speech." [...] Ironically, it was Schabowski who {{two and a half years}} later, on the 9th November 1989, became the person to open the wall by providing a slightly mistaken answer on a press conference <b>about</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> travel regulations for East German citizens.|$|E

It was not until eight months later that the naval high command recognized there were serious problems with the functioning of the torpedoes. [...] The Americans were still unaware of the range and power of Japanese torpedoes and the effectiveness of Japanese night battle tactics. [...] In fact, Wright claimed that his ships must have been fired on by submarines since the observed position of Tanaka's ships [...] "make it improbable that torpedoes with speed-distance characteristics similar to our own" [...] could have caused such damage, though Tanaka states that his torpedoes were fired at a range as short as three miles. [...] The Americans would not recognize the true capabilities of their Pacific adversary's torpedoes (particularly the surface-ship-fired Type 93 [...] "Long Lance") and night tactics until well into 1943. [...] After the war, Tanaka said of his victory at Tassafaronga, [...] "I have heard that US naval experts praised my command in that action. [...] I am not deserving of such honors. [...] It was the superb proficiency and devotion of the men who served me that produced the tactical victory for us." ...|$|E

[...] Jon Bershad of Mediaite commented, [...] "It’s as tense and exciting as expected." [...] Writing for TV Squad, Joel Keller analyzed Carter's comparison of Leno's legal contract with O'Brien's, and wrote that the author [...] "paints a picture of Leno and his producer, Debbie Vickers, as pragmatists and Conan as a cockeyed idealist". Joe Flint of Los Angeles Times commented <b>about</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the media industry since Carter's prior book The Late Shift, [...] "The only difference is that the media world has changed a lot then, and while [...] "The Late Shift" [...] had a lot of inside dirt and drama that was news to everyone but the most hardcore industry insiders, this time around the soap opera played out on TV and in the media." [...] James Poniewozik of Time wrote, [...] "There are lots of juicy bits, but the big takeaway: the guy with the best contract, wins", and called the book, [...] "Bill Carter's Jaypocalypse dirt-disher". Writing for ABC News, journalist Sheila Marikar commented, [...] "Bill Carter's new book, 'The War for Late Night,' reveals what happened behind the scenes, the expletives that were hurled during closed-door discussions, the roller coaster that O'Brien, Leno, and their cohorts rode during that tumultuous time." ...|$|E

2500|$|In pain {{research}} fMRS complements fMRI and PET techniques.

These fMRS studies are valuable because they show that some or all Glx compounds (glutamate, GABA and glutamine) increase during painful stimuli in the studied brain regions.|$|E
