5|$|Federal {{and state}} {{officials}} became concerned about ticket scalping and fraud related to sales of the tickets for the swearing-in ceremony. Senator Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, introduced legislation in mid-November 2008 to ban sales of tickets to the swearing-in ceremony. At the same time, the joint congressional committee contacted online auction operators, ticket resellers and classified listing services to block sales of the tickets. To address the committee's concerns, StubHub and eBay agreed to ban ticket sales for the swearing-in ceremony on all of its sites. Senator Feinstein re-introduced legislation in December 2008 to ban ticket sales for the swearing-in ceremony after <b>amending</b> <b>the</b> bill to exempt tickets issued by official presidential inaugural committees for inaugural event fundraising. The U.S.Senate failed to pass the final bill, which caused the bill {{to die in the}} closing days of the lame duck legislative session.|$|E
5|$|In 1860â€“61 the {{legislature}} started formal military {{training at the}} school with a law <b>amending</b> <b>the</b> original 1851 statute. During the Civil War, the seminary became The Florida Military and Collegiate Institute. Enrollment at the school increased to around 250 students with the school establishing itself as perhaps {{the largest and most}} respected educational institution in the state. Cadets from the school defeated Union forces at the Battle of Natural Bridge in 1865, leaving Tallahassee as the only Confederate capital east of the Mississippi River not to fall to Union forces. The students were trained by Valentine Mason Johnson, a graduate of Virginia Military Institute, who was a professor of mathematics and the chief administrator of the college. After the fall of the Confederacy, campus buildings were occupied by Union military forces for approximately four months and the West Florida Seminary reverted to its former academic purpose.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{returned}} to the Senate in January 1965, walking with a cane. He employed a stronger and more effective legislative staff. He took on President Lyndon B. Johnson and almost succeeded in <b>amending</b> <b>the</b> Voting Rights Act of 1965 to explicitly ban the poll tax {{at the state and}} local level (rather than just directing the Attorney General to challenge its constitutionality there), thereby gaining a reputation for legislative skill. He was a leader in pushing through the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which ended a quota system based upon national origin and which, despite Kennedy's predictions, would have a profound effect on the demographic makeup of the United States. He played a role in creation of the National Teachers Corps.|$|E

5|$|The Arab Spring began {{sweeping}} the Arab world in 2011, where large-scale protests erupted demanding {{economic and political}} reforms. However, many of these protests in some countries turned into civil wars and more instability. In Jordan, in response to domestic unrest, Abdullah replaced his prime minister and introduced a number of reforms including: <b>amending</b> <b>the</b> Constitution and establishing a number of governmental commissions. Proportional representation was re-introduced to the Jordanian parliament in the 2016 general election, a move which he said would eventually lead to establishing parliamentary governments. Although some local opposition groups called his reforms inadequate, other observers praised them. They took place amid unprecedented regional instability: an influx of 1.4 million Syrian refugees into the natural resources-lacking country {{and the emergence of}} the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} of 1159 {{and the subsequent}} schism shows the necessity of <b>amending</b> <b>the</b> rules concerning papal elections. The decree Licet de evitanda discordia issued by the Third Lateran Council in 1179 abolished the rule of unanimity in favour {{of the rule of}} the majority of two thirds. The decree confirmed also that all three orders of the College of Cardinals (bishops, priests and deacons) are equal in the papal elections. Although the practice allowing the participation of cardinal-priests and cardinal-deacons on equal rights with cardinal-bishops had been introduced no later than in the papal election, 1118, the decree In Nomine Domini (1059) conferring the special electoral rights on the cardinal-bishops had never been formally revoked up to that time.|$|E
5|$|Hawkins {{was officially}} {{selected}} by Geelong in the 2006 national draft under the fatherâ€“son rule. Whilst many pundits lauded {{him as the}} best key position prospect within the draft, and felt Hawkins' junior performances warranted possible selection with the top overall pick, the father-son rules at the time only required Geelong to use a middle-tier third round pick to draft him. The subsequent controversy over what was widely acknowledged as a bargain gain for the Cats led to the AFL <b>amending</b> <b>the</b> father-son ruling for future use. With {{a reputation as one}} of the finest young tall forwards in the land, Hawkins was immediately billed as the successor to the legendary Gary Ablett, whose retirement ten years earlier had left a gaping hole in Geelongs forward line. A stress reaction injury to his right leg, however, halted Hawkins' pre-season, forcing his much-awaited debut in Geelong colours to take place in the Victorian Football League (VFL) side.|$|E

5|$|The Egyptian {{identification}} card controversy {{began in the}} 1990s when the government modernized the electronic processing of identity documents, which introduced a de facto requirement that documents must list the person's religion as Muslim, Christian, or Jewish (the only three religions officially recognized by the government). Consequently, BahÃ¡'Ã­s were unable to obtain government identification documents (such as national {{identification card}}s, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, or passports) necessary to exercise their rights in their country unless they lied about their religion, which conflicts with BahÃ¡'Ã­ religious principle. Without documents, {{they could not be}} employed, educated, treated in hospitals, travel outside of the country, or vote, among other hardships. Following a protracted legal process culminating in a court ruling favorable to the BahÃ¡'Ã­s, the interior minister of Egypt released a decree on 14 April 2009, <b>amending</b> <b>the</b> law to allow Egyptians who are not Muslim, Christian, or Jewish to obtain identification documents that list a dash in place of one of the three recognized religions. The first identification cards were issued to two BahÃ¡'Ã­s under the new decree on 8 August 2009.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} checks and {{balances}} built into the state constitution that limit {{the power of the}} General Assembly. Other clauses allow the General Assembly to balance and limit the authority of the other branches of the government. Among these {{checks and balances}} is the governor's authority to veto any bill passed by the General Assembly. The General Assembly may in turn override his veto by simple majority vote in both houses. Bills passed by a super majority automatically become law without requiring the signature of the governor. Once the bill is made law, it can be challenged in the state courts which may rule the law to be unconstitutional, effectively repealing the law. The General Assembly could then override the court's decision by <b>amending</b> <b>the</b> state constitution to include the law. The General Assembly has historically been the most powerful branch of the state government, dominating a weak governor's office. Although the governor has gained more power in the past fifty years, the General Assembly still retains the power to remove much of that authority.|$|E
5|$|The State of Illinois {{wanted a}} {{commemorative}} coin {{to be issued}} for the centennial of its 1818 admission to the Union. A bill that would accomplish this, H.R. 8764, was introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives on January 16, 1918 by that state's Loren E. Wheeler. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, which held hearings on March 5. Wheeler told the committee (of which {{he was not a}} member) that the coins were desired for distribution during the celebrations in Illinois. He had been to see Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo and Mint Director Raymond T. Baker. Neither had any objection to the legislation, though McAdoo had explained that the problem with commemorative coins was that they did not sell as well as expected, and many were returned to the Mint for melting. After telling of his meeting with the officials, Wheeler explained to the committee that the coins would be purchased by the State Treasurer of Illinois and so there would be no returns. James L. Slayden of Texas asked what the cost to the federal government would be, but Wheeler did not know. Slayden asked what had been the cost for the 1916â€“1917 McKinley Birthplace Memorial dollar, and Ohio's William A. Ashbrook, the chairman of the committee, said that the cost of the dies had been borne by the group purchasing the coins from the government; Ashbrook proposed <b>amending</b> <b>the</b> bill to make this clear this would be an expense to be paid by Illinois. Wheeler had no objection, and stated that to avoid returns, it might be best if the issue was limited to 100,000 coins rather than the 200,000 in the original bill. Ashbrook then asked if the coins were to be sold at a premium by the centennial committee, and Wheeler denied this, indicating that they were to be circulated like any other half dollar. This concluded the public hearing on the bill, with the committee to take further action in executive session.|$|E
