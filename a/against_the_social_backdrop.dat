40|$|The {{theme of}} this paper is {{engagement}} in art as a stimulant to enterprise education with young people. Reflecting on their experiences of initiating and managing the case study outlined, the paper describes a process of arts intervention in a school based enterprise project. Set <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>backdrop</b> of urban renewal, the project outlined effectively establishes a voice for young people that counters the imposition of regeneration initiatives whilst maintaining the imperative of an art that is free from the absolute requirements of function.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the history of America 2 ̆ 7 s other {{peculiar}} institution: the elected judiciary. Elected judges are found virtually nowhere else in the world, but in America they are a fact of life in the considerable majority of states. The history of the elected judiciary is surprisingly little explored. This paper examines the post-Civil War trend away from Jacksonian populism and toward a more aristocratic view of the judiciary as a body set apart from the people. After the Civil War, many states, including New York, lengthened terms of office for their elected judges; some states even switched back to an appointive system. In New York, this reform was sparked by a perception of rampant corruption among New York City judges. The paper delves into the little-understood areas of how elected judges were nominated and how they campaigned in the late nineteenth century. The judicial elections process is set <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>backdrop</b> of massive immigration into New York City and the resulting rise of the Tweed Ring. The paper describes the Ring 2 ̆ 7 s corruption of key members of the judiciary, together with the ethnic rancor ignited by allegations of judicial corruption. Leading the judicial reform efforts were members of the elite bar. The paper discusses the backgrounds of elite lawyers and their role in lengthening judicial terms and in founding the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. The Association proved active in working to impeach the most notorious judges of the Tammany Hall Ring. For some time, many worried that the lack of a sound judiciary would cause New York 2 ̆ 7 s newly burgeoning economy to collapse, much like the difficulties a corrupt judiciary poses in developing countries today. In the end, New York was able to reform the judiciary sufficiently that persons and property were reasonably secure, and New York 2 ̆ 7 s rise to commercial prominence could continue...|$|E
40|$|It is <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>social</b> and {{cultural}} <b>backdrop</b> of South Africa that I investigate gender performativity in South African films {{with reference to}} Leon Schuster’s comedies; There’s a Zulu on my Stoep (1993), Mr Bones (2001); Mama Jack (2005) and Mad Buddies (2012). Leon Schuster {{is responsible for the}} most commercially successfully films produced in Africa. The significance of this research lends itself to the notion that the trends and tendencies of contemporary culture are defined by what is represented and learnt through constructed representations in mainstream media such as film. For the purpose of this study, gender representation and comedy within the framework of South African film are the main foci. There appears to be very little written on comedy and gender, specifically in a South African context. Judith Butler’s performativity theory forms the methodological foundation of analysis of the representation of gender in Schuster’s films. In addition, visual textual and constant comparison analysis are used as part of the methodological framework of this study. Due to the lack of literature on South African film comedy, the general understanding of comedy refers to the film genre as being a catalyst for transformation. It is also suggested that social control is reinforced and therefore, upholds societal {{and cultural}} ideologies in comedy. Satire is also found to postulate a preferred comedic mechanism to criticise ideologies in countries with repressive regimes. South African comedy is also understood to contribute towards tension relief in such countries through the means of facilitating laughter. In a general framework, as well as Schuster’s film comedies, gender representation and therefore that of gender performativity is found to conform to stereotypical conventions of males and females which ultimately maintains the ideals of the creators and the contextual ideologies they stand to represent and serve. By making representations of gender and that of gender performativity laughable, Schuster’s comedies can be said to raise awareness of the gender differences and inequalities in representations. The stereotypes which ultimately highlight gender inequality in the films, follows that of cultural, social and traditional norms.

2500|$|Wittgenstein {{argues that}} {{definitions}} emerge {{from what he}} termed [...] "forms of life", roughly the culture and society {{in which they are}} used. Wittgenstein stresses <b>the</b> <b>social</b> aspects of cognition; to see how language works for most cases, we have to see how it functions in a specific social situation. It is this emphasis on becoming attentive to <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>backdrop</b> <b>against</b> which language is rendered intelligible that explains Wittgenstein's elliptical comment that [...] "If a lion could talk, we could not understand him." [...] However, in proposing the thought experiment involving the fictional character, Robinson Crusoe, a captain shipwrecked on a desolate island [...] with no other inhabitant, Wittgenstein shows that language is not in all cases a social phenomenon (although, they are for most cases); instead the criterion for a language is grounded in a set of interrelated normative activities: teaching, explanations, techniques and criteria of correctness. In short, it is essential that a language is shareable, but this does not imply that for a language to function that it is in fact already shared.|$|R

Drawing upon 12 teacher narratives this presentation explores the intricate ways in individuals classified as ‘native-English speaker’ teachers attempt to negotiate and manage the real, imagined, dictated and desired dimensions of their identities from a variety of perspectives. Implications for foreign language education will be presented and participants will be invited to imagine and discuss the problematic position of being and defining the parameters of the ‘native-English speaker’ teacher status-label...|$|R
