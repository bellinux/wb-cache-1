5|$|Double hulls {{have become}} {{popular in the}} past ten years. Designing a vessel with double sides adds {{primarily}} to its breadth, since bulkers are already required to have double bottoms. One of the advantages of the double hull is to make room to place all the structural elements in the sides, removing them from the holds. This increases the volume of the holds, and simplifies their structure which helps in loading, unloading, and cleaning. Double sides <b>also</b> <b>improve</b> a ship's capacity for ballasting, which is useful when carrying light goods: the ship may have to increase its draft for stability or seakeeping reasons, which is done by adding ballast water.|$|E
5|$|In {{adopting}} Christianity as {{the state}} religion, Mieszko sought to achieve several personal goals. He saw Poland's baptism {{as a way of}} strengthening his hold on power, as well as using it as a unifying force for the Polish people. It replaced several smaller cults with a single, central one, clearly associated with the royal court. It would <b>also</b> <b>improve</b> the position and respectability of the Polish state on the international, European scene. The Church also helped to strengthen the monarch's authority, and brought to Poland much experience with regard to state administration. Thus, the Church organisation supported the state, and in return, bishops received important government titles (in the later era, they were members of the Senate of Poland).|$|E
5|$|Meredith had to {{deal with}} {{extremely}} physical defences, and was often boxed into the corner of the pitch by as many as four players. As his talents became widely regarded, more well organised defences would designate him with a man-marker, to try and isolate him from his teammates. This often left him reliant on an unselfish inside-right partner willing to fetch and carry the ball for him without expecting much in terms of goals or glory in return. A hard-working wing-half would <b>also</b> <b>improve</b> Meredith's effectiveness by winning the ball and sending him a pass down the flank. The best teams he played in also had a centre-forward able {{to make the most of}} his accurate crosses.|$|E
5000|$|Johansson <b>also</b> <b>improved</b> the {{adjustable}} spanner, patenting in 1891.|$|R
50|$|In 1903, {{the public}} {{education}} system was established with George Bohner {{as the first}} American teacher. Public health <b>also</b> <b>improved</b> when Dr. Pedro Malbas was appointed as the Public Health Officer in the 1920s and constructed sanitary toilets, deep wells and drainage canals. Public infrastructure was <b>also</b> <b>improved</b> by the Americans.|$|R

5|$|Pituitary tumors require {{treatment}} {{when they}} are causing specific symptoms, such as headaches, visual field defects or excessive hormone secretion. Transsphenoidal surgery (removal of the tumor by an operation through the nose and the sphenoidal sinuses) may, apart from addressing symptoms related to the tumor, <b>also</b> <b>improve</b> pituitary function, although the gland is sometimes damaged further {{as a result of}} the surgery. When the tumor is removed by craniotomy (opening the skull), recovery is less likely–but sometimes this is the only suitable way to approach the tumor. After surgery, it may take some time for hormone levels to change significantly. Retesting the pituitary hormone levels is therefore performed 2 to 3 months later.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Line has {{two primary}} goals. The {{first is to}} link Washington, D.C. by rail to Washington Dulles International Airport and the edge cities of Tysons Corner, Reston, Herndon, and Ashburn. The second is to spur urban {{development}} in Tysons Corner and reduce overall reliance on highway traffic in the business district, Virginia's largest and the 12th-largest in the country. The district's area is comparable in size to downtown Washington, D.C., but is rather insulated from its surrounding neighborhoods and has no existing grid pattern in its streets. The Silver Line would <b>also</b> <b>improve</b> public access to the Udvar-Hazy Center, an annex of National Air and Space Museum located near Dulles Airport; Virginia Regional Transit currently runs a shuttle bus {{from the airport to}} Udvar-Hazy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} and final season, Aang is unable to use the Avatar State. Although {{reluctant}} with the plan at first, Aang accepts to have everyone think he had died and his remaining allies attack the Fire Nation's capital, but are thwarted by Azula. However, Zuko has a change of heart, rebels against his father, and offers to teach Aang Firebending. Aang and Zuko <b>also</b> <b>improve</b> their Firebending powers with the help of their world's last two dragons. During the finale, finding himself on a strange island, Aang is reluctant to actually kill Fire Lord Ozai, despite his four previous past lives convincing him it is the only way. But upon learning that he was actually {{on the back of a}} Lion Turtle, one of four that made the first benders by manipulating humans' chi, Aang receives the Lion Turtles' Energybending ability. With this ability, as he regained his Avatar State, Aang removes Ozai's bending ability, rendering him harmless and ending the Hundred Year War. Later, in the Fire Nation capital, Aang is seen beside Zuko, the new Fire Lord. The series ends with Aang and his friends relaxing at Iroh's tea shop at Ba Sing Se, where Aang and Katara share a kiss.|$|E
50|$|The Branch Avenue (Maryland Route 5) Interchange was <b>also</b> <b>improved.</b>|$|R
30|$|AUC {{correction}} {{improves the}} peak agreement while <b>also</b> <b>improving</b> AUC agreement.|$|R
50|$|Mobile {{coverage}} is <b>also</b> <b>improving.</b> Water supply is ensured in all villages.|$|R
25|$|Anticoagulants can <b>also</b> <b>improve</b> blood flow. The use of {{warfarin}} {{has been}} proposed, but the extensive monitoring required makes it unsuitable in most cases.|$|E
25|$|The {{inhibition}} of the sodium pump may <b>also</b> <b>improve</b> baroreceptor sensitivity in HF and may {{explain some of}} the neurohormonal effects of digoxin. Digoxin also has important parasympathetic effects, particularly on the atrioventricular node.|$|E
25|$|A {{ceramic coating}} for the rims is {{available}} which may reduce wear and can <b>also</b> <b>improve</b> both {{wet and dry}} braking. It may also slightly reduce heat transfer {{to the inside of}} the rims because it is a thermal insulator.|$|E
50|$|Eperisone <b>also</b> <b>improves</b> {{dizziness}} and tinnitus {{associated with}} cerebrovascular disorders or cervical spondylosis.|$|R
50|$|Continual {{development}} {{to this day}} of the fuel injection mapping <b>also</b> <b>improves</b> the rideability.|$|R
25|$|Valée <b>also</b> <b>improved</b> {{the guns}} {{themselves}} slightly, {{by making them}} lighter, and with a longer range.|$|R
25|$|The {{results of}} {{reconciliation}} ecology can <b>also</b> <b>improve</b> human well-being. E. O. Wilson has hypothesized that humans have an innate {{desire to be}} close to nature (see Biophilia), and numerous studies have linked natural settings to decreased stress and faster recovery during hospital stays.|$|E
25|$|The runway {{reconfiguration}} at O'Hare will <b>also</b> <b>improve</b> {{the airport}} for future Airbus A380 service. On July 5, 2007 the runway previously designated 9R/27L became runway 10/28. On May 2, 2013, that same runway (10/28) became 10L/28R. On August 30, 2007, runway 9L/27R became 9R/27L.|$|E
25|$|Characters can <b>also</b> <b>improve</b> {{their life}} skills, which include Cooking, Tailoring, and First Aid. There are also music skills, {{including}} Playing Instrument and Composing. These skills can give players advantages {{to improve their}} battle experiences or {{can be used to}} improve their social experience within the game.|$|E
50|$|Another {{advantage}} {{is in the}} over-bored barrel design, which reduces muzzle jump and <b>also</b> <b>improves</b> shot-patterns.|$|R
50|$|Seacoral <b>also</b> <b>improved</b> {{handling}} at idling speeds {{by adding}} 3in {{to the length}} of the rudders.|$|R
50|$|Valée <b>also</b> <b>improved</b> {{the guns}} {{themselves}} slightly, {{by making them}} lighter, and with a longer range.|$|R
25|$|East Branch Clarion River Lake {{also serves}} {{recreational}} purposes. Controlled releases of water {{during the dry}} summer months help to improve water quality and quantity for industrial and domestic uses. These releases of the lake waters <b>also</b> <b>improve</b> navigation on the rivers and enhance aquatic life.|$|E
25|$|Data relay {{satellite}} (数据中继卫星) Tianlian I (天链一号), specially {{developed to}} decrease the communication time between the Shenzhou 7 spaceship and the ground; it will <b>also</b> <b>improve</b> the amount of data that can be transferred. The current orbit coverage of 12 percent will thus be increased {{to a total of}} about 60 percent.|$|E
25|$|Researchers at Yale University and the National Institute of Standards and Technology argue {{artificial}} cells {{could be}} built that not only replicate the electrical behavior of electric eel cells, but <b>also</b> <b>improve</b> on them. Artificial versions of the eel's electricity-generating cells could be developed as a power source for medical implants and other microscopic devices.|$|E

The weight distribution and turning circle were <b>also</b> <b>improved.</b> Top speed increased to 88 mi/h km/h and the fuel consumption was <b>also</b> <b>improved</b> at 28 mpgimp.|$|R
25|$|In {{the context}} of the European debt crisis, some {{observers}} noted that Spain and California, two troubled economies within Europe and the United States, and also Germany, the primary and politically most fragile supporter of a euro currency bailout would benefit from IMF recognition of their leadership in green technology, and directly from Green Fund–generated demand for their exports, which could <b>also</b> <b>improve</b> their credit ratings.|$|E
25|$|There is low to {{moderate}} quality evidence that when CIs are implanted in both ears {{at the same}} time, they improve hearing in noisy places for people with severe loss of hearing. There {{is some evidence that}} implanting CIs to improve hearing may <b>also</b> <b>improve</b> tinnitus but there is some risk that it may cause people who never had tinnitus to get it.|$|E
25|$|The {{world economy}} {{is going through a}} massive {{transition}} right now. The knowledge economy is the future. By bringing everyone online, we'll not only improve billions of lives, but we'll <b>also</b> <b>improve</b> our own as we benefit from the ideas and productivity they contribute to the world. Giving everyone the opportunity to connect is the foundation for enabling the knowledge economy. It is not the only thing we need to do, but it's a fundamental and necessary step.|$|E
50|$|OSShD <b>also</b> <b>improves</b> the technical, {{legal and}} tariff {{compatibility}} between OSShD members and transport systems in Europe.|$|R
