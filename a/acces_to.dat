The alumni have started an association (ACCES Alumni Association - AAA) which now sponsors secondary students through donations from its members. As of 2013, more than two million shillings has been raised and an endowment fund started with more than one million shillings to continue helping poor students to access higher education. ACCES also partners with the Ministry of Education to enhance primary schools in poor rural areas, including teacher training, learning and teaching materials, construction of classrooms and subsidies for poor families who cannot afford to access education for their children. ACCES also provides community development activities through its network of partnerships, such as the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute, Ministry of Agriculture, Kenya Environmental Research Program and many others. Using an integrated approach, ACCES brings income generation, agri-busimness, health, hygiene, clean water, gender equity, child rights, and governance to help communities become self-sufficient and sustainable. ACCES has as its chief operating principle the idea of “Kenyanization” whereby all of its programs are initiated, designed and implemented by a staff of Kenyans, working with local partners, government and institutions.

In this paper we extend the <b>ACCE</b> model <b>to</b> cover protocols with many different sub-protocols, capturing both multiple ciphersuites and multiple versions, and define a security notion for secure negotiation of the optimal sub-protocol.
