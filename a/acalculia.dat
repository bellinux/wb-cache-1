5000|$|<b>Acalculia</b> is an {{acquired}} impairment in which patients have difficulty performing simple mathematical tasks, such as adding, subtracting, multiplying and even simply stating which of two numbers is larger. <b>Acalculia</b> is distinguished from dyscalculia in that <b>acalculia</b> is acquired {{late in life}} due to neurological injury such as stroke, while dyscalculia is a specific developmental disorder first observed during the acquisition of mathematical knowledge. The name comes from the Greek [...] "a" [...] meaning [...] "not" [...] and Latin [...] "calculare", which means [...] "to count".|$|E
5000|$|Because <b>acalculia</b> is {{a symptom}} of the more {{commonly}} known Gerstmann's syndrome, {{it may be difficult to}} solely diagnose <b>acalculia.</b> Instead, it may be labeled as one of its symptoms, and lead to the eventual diagnosis of Gerstmann's syndrome. [...] "Provided that general mental impairment and significant aphasic disorder can be excluded as primary factors, the presentation of deficits such as agraphia, <b>acalculia,</b> and right-left confusion should alert the clinician to the possibility of focal posterior parietal lobe disease." [...] (Disorders) Structural and functional neuroimaging may be of further value in determining the existence of underlying neurologic abnormalities.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a strong}} link between <b>acalculia</b> and finger agnosia. Early in development, {{calculation}} begins with our fingers. The order that we use when we count with our finger is very specific and it is found {{in a variety of}} different cultures. The use of a base ten number system is also found in many cultures. Gerstmann believed that it was no coincidence the word digit means both a finger and any numeral.Rusconi et al. suggested that these two conditions co-occur because they are close in cortical territory. In their 2005 study with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), they noted both finger agnosia and <b>acalculia</b> in the test subjects when areas of the intraparietal sulcus were stimulated. They concluded that the areas underlying finger agnosia and <b>acalculia</b> are extremely close to one another, but distinct. These areas receive blood from the same branch of the middle cerebral artery. Any damage to that blood supply would cause symptoms of both <b>acalculia</b> and finger agnosia.|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{abilities}} {{are thought to}} rest on the integration of two distinct systems, a verbal system of number words and a non-symbolic representation of approximate quantities. This view has lead to the classification of <b>acalculias</b> into two broad categories depending on whether the deficit affects the verbal or the quantity system. Here, we test the association of deficits predicted by this theory, and particularly {{the presence or absence of}} impairments in non-symbolic quantity processing. We describe two acalculic patients, one with a focal lesion of the left parietal lobe and Gerstmann's syndrome and another with semantic dementia with predominantly left temporal hypometabolism. As predicted by a quantity deficit, the first patient was more impaired in subtraction than in multiplication, showed a severe slowness in approximation, and exhibited associated impairments in subitizing and numerical comparison tasks, both with Arabic digits and with arrays of dots. As predicted by a verbal deficit, the second patient was more impaired in multiplication than in subtraction, had intact approximation abilities, and showed preserved processing of non-symbolic numerosities...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Acalculia</b> is {{associated}} with lesions of the parietal lobe (especially the angular gyrus) and the frontal lobe and can be an early sign of dementia. <b>Acalculia</b> is sometimes observed as a [...] "pure" [...] deficit, but is commonly observed {{as one of a}} constellation of symptoms, including agraphia, finger agnosia and right-left confusion, after damage to the left angular gyrus, known as Gerstmann's syndrome.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "acalculia" [...] {{was coined}} by Henschen in 1925; {{it refers to}} the {{decrease}} in cognitive capacity for calculation that results from damage to the brain. Earlier, in 1908, researchers Lewandowsky and Stadelmann published the first report of an individual afflicted with calculation impairment due to brain damage. The individual had trouble performing calculations on paper and mentally. Further, he had difficulty recognizing arithmetic symbols. The report was key in that it established calculation disorders as separate from language disorders, as the two were formerly associated.Henshcen's research was consistent with Lewandowsky's and Stadelmann's finding. From his research, he was also able to propose that certain areas of the brain played particular roles involved in the understanding and execution of calculation. These areas include the third frontal convolution (pronunciation of numbers), the angular gyrus and the fissure interparietalis (reading of numbers), and the angular gyrus again for the writing of numbers.Shortly after Henshen's advances, Berger in 1926 distinguished between primary and secondary <b>acalculia.</b> Primary <b>acalculia</b> is a [...] "pure" [...] condition in which an individual can neither comprehend mathematical concepts nor perform mathematical operations. Secondary <b>acalculia</b> is a loss of calculation abilities that stems from other cognitive difficulties, such as memory. It has been questioned whether primary <b>acalculia</b> can exist independently of other cognitive impairments.In 1936, Lindquist proposed that lesions of different areas of the brain can cause different calculation defects, and that there are therefore several variations of acalculia.In 1940, Gerstmann claimed that <b>acalculia</b> is associated with aspects of Gerstmann's syndrome, which include right-left confusion, agraphia, and digital agnosia.In 1983, Boller and Grafman further concluded that calculation difficulties can also arise from various shortcomings, such as the inability to assign value to the name of a number.Little research has been done on <b>acalculia,</b> despite the fact the calculation is considered an essential, upper-level cognitive skill. However, calculation skills are assessed in neuropsychological exams such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). There exist no norms for <b>Acalculia</b> against which a person can be compared to assess his/her level of cognitive impairment with regards to calculation abilities.|$|E
5000|$|... "Gerstmann {{syndrome}} and similar posterior parietal symptom combinations (like <b>acalculia)</b> {{are usually the}} result of focal cerebrovascular disease in a posterior branch of the left middle cerebral artery or a broader zone infarct, usually involving the angular gyrus or subjacent white matter (Brodmann area 39). In rare cases, traumatic brain injury of an expanding neoplasm in this same region can cause all or elements (<b>acalculia</b> {{is one of four}} elements) of the symptoms of this syndrome".|$|E
5000|$|Damage done to parietal lobe, {{specifically}} in the left hemisphere, can produce difficulties in counting and other simple arithmetic. [...] Damage directly to the intraparietal sulcus {{has been shown to}} cause <b>acalculia,</b> a severe disorder in mathematical cognition. [...] Symptoms vary based the location of damage, but can include the inability to perform simple calculations or to decide that one number is larger than another. Gerstmann syndrome, a disease resulting in lesions in the left parietal and temporal lobes, results in <b>acalculia</b> symptoms and further confirms the importance of the parietal region in the ANS.|$|E
5000|$|Cognitive: <b>Acalculia,</b> paraphasia, anomic aphasia, recalling memories, [...] "going into a trance", [...] "out of this world", {{conduction}} aphasia, hemispatial neglect, alexia, déjà vu, reliving past experiences, agraphia, apraxia, etc.|$|E
50|$|Mathematical disabilities {{can occur}} {{as the result}} of some types of brain injury, in which case the proper term, <b>acalculia,</b> is to {{distinguish}} it from dyscalculia which is of innate, genetic or developmental origin.|$|E
5000|$|Common {{screening}} procedures for <b>acalculia</b> include asking {{the patient to}} answer questions about order, conducting memory tests to rule out the possibility of a mental disorder, confrontation naming (naming parts of objects), reading tests, writing tests, calculation tests, finger naming, clock drawing, and left/right orientation testing. The writing tests, spelling tests, finger naming, and left/right orientation are all tests to confirm the presence of Gerstmann's syndrome. <b>Acalculia</b> is one out of four defining components of Gerstmann's syndrome; the other three components are agraphia, finger agnosia, and right/left confusion. Typically, <b>acalculia</b> is present because of Gerstmann's syndrome or it is linked with other disorders. It is imperative to note that there is [...] "difficulty separating calculation disorders from disruptions in other domains". This is why testing functions besides calculation abilities is crucial for the screening of acalculia- so that other disorders can be ruled out. More extensive testing includes [...] "brain mapping techniques such as position emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and event related potentials (ERP), which have helped to illuminate some of the functional anatomical relationships for number processing".|$|E
50|$|Gerstmann {{syndrome}} and similar symptom combinations are outcomes, not diseases. Treatment, therefore, {{is dedicated to}} the underlying neurological abnormality. Cognitive rehabilitation may be useful for the symptoms that interfere with activities of daily life, such as agraphia and <b>acalculia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Individuals with <b>acalculia</b> {{generally}} live normal lives, {{unless there}} are other disabilities or traumatic injuries present that prevent normal living. Details from a case study published in 2003 described the condition of a 55-year-old woman living with <b>acalculia.</b> [...] "In addition to writing and calculation deficits, both spelling and reading had declined. Lapses of memory occurred occasionally. Despite these deficits, daily living activities remained intact". Another case study published in 1990 described the condition and management of a former female accountant who had [...] "suffered a small circumscribed left parietal subdural hematoma in an auto accident." [...] She was able to speak, read, and write normally, but {{she was unable to}} perform simple addition past the number ten. The case study reports that the patient also demonstrated [...] "severe finger agnosia, and in fact the finger agnosia appeared to be directly related to her inability to perform calculations." [...] The patient was somewhat able to manage her <b>acalculia</b> by visiting a therapist who worked with her specifically on finger recognition tasks, especially on finger calculations. This therapy raised her mathematical ability to a high school level after she received treatment for a number of months.|$|E
50|$|Damage to {{the left}} angular gyrus is known to cause {{computational}} difficulties like those associated with primary <b>acalculia</b> and anarithmetia. However, damage to various but not necessarily identified {{areas of the brain}} can cause computational difficulties, as various cognitive functions are necessary to execute mathematical calculations.|$|E
50|$|Damage to {{the left}} parietal lobe can result in what is called Gerstmann syndrome. It can include right-left confusion, a {{difficulty}} with writing Agraphia and a difficulty with mathematics <b>Acalculia.</b> In addition, it can also produce language deficiencies Aphasia and an inability to recognize objects normally Agnosia.|$|E
50|$|The angular gyrus is {{the part}} of the brain {{associated}} with complex language functions (i.e. reading, writing and interpretation of what is written). Lesion to this part of the brain shows symptoms of the Gerstmann syndrome: effects include finger tap agnosia, alexia (inability to read), <b>acalculia</b> (inability to use arithmetic operations), agraphia (inability to copy), and left-right confusion.|$|E
5000|$|In a case study, Rosselli and Ardila {{describe}} {{the rehabilitation of}} a 58-year-old woman with spatial alexia, agraphia, and <b>acalculia</b> associated to a vascular injury in the right hemisphere.

In a special test of written arithmetical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and initial score of 0/20 was obtained. She was observed to have mixed up the arithmetical procedures and inadequately oriented the columns in mathematical problems.The rehabilitation techniques implemented included the following: ...|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} ways in which {{rehabilitation}} of <b>acalculia</b> is carried out. Tsvetkova proposes using the [...] "number reconstruction" [...] method. It is started by incorporating certain [...] "visual elements (e.g., completing eight, starting from the number 3), looking for certain elements within a number (e.g., looking for the number 1 in the number 4), and finally, performing a verbal analysis of {{the similarities and differences}} that can be observed between numbers". At the same time that these number reconstruction technique is used, spatial orientation exercises, comprehension of the right-to-left relationship, and visual analysis of geometrical objects and forms should be developed.|$|E
50|$|The {{above-mentioned}} studies allow inferring {{the neural}} correlate of the numerical Stroop effect. However, {{they do not}} allow concluding whether parietal lobe function is critical for this effect. Brain stimulation studies that use techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation or transcranial direct current stimulation allow modulating parietal lobe function and inferring its role. These {{studies have suggested that}} the right parietal lobe in particular is necessary for the numerical Stroop effect, albeit stimulation of the right parietal lobe might affect other connected brain regions. Moreover, work with acquired <b>acalculia</b> suggested involvement of the left parietal lobe in the numerical Stroop effect. This effect is commonly reduced in cases of brain damage to the left intraparietal sulcus.|$|E
50|$|As {{calculation}} {{involves the}} integration of several cognitive skills, it is understood that an individual with <b>acalculia</b> (or calculation difficulties) is deficient {{in any of the}} following four realms: 1) understanding that every number represents a value and immediately registering this value, 2) recognizing a number's value with respect to other numbers, 3) knowing a number's location in series of numbers, and 4) association of a numerical symbol with its name, spoken verbally.Young schoolchildren are presented with mathematical concepts in a cumulative manner. Advancement requires the grasping of fundamental concepts before progressing to more difficult and involved concepts. There is a natural variation in the speed with which young schoolchildren grasp mathematical concepts, and those that have extreme difficulty retaining the foundations of mathematical concepts (such as global quantification or numerosity perception) are considered to have developmental dyscalculia.|$|E
50|$|Henik {{studies the}} {{building}} blocks of numerical cognition and developmental dyscalculia—a specific deficiency in arithmetic that is similar in nature and prevalence to dyslexia. Together with Joseph Tzelgov, Henik designed the numerical Stroop task and showed (a) the intimate relationship between sizes and numbers, and (b) the fact that numerical values are processed automatically even when completely irrelevant to the task. In subsequent years, it was found that performance in the numerical Stroop task depends on knowledge of the numerical system, involves specific brain areas (i.e., the cortical intraparietal sulcus), and is compromised in developmental dyscalculia and <b>acalculia.</b> In recent years Henik pointed out the importance of non-countable dimensions (e.g., which object is larger in size, how much water is in the glass) to numerical cognition. In recent publications, Henik and students suggested the existence of a magnitude sense rather than a number sense, with the former based on the ability to perceive and evaluate non-countable dimensions (e.g., size).|$|E
5000|$|Damage to the {{parietal lobe}} {{results in the}} {{syndrome}} ‘neglect' which is when patients treat part of their body or objects in their visual field as though it never existed. Damage {{to the left side}} of the parietal lobe can result in what is called Gerstmann syndrome. It includes right-left confusion, difficulty with writing (agraphia) and difficulty with mathematics (<b>acalculia).</b> It can also produce disorders of language (aphasia) and the inability to perceive objects. Damage to the right parietal lobe can result in neglecting part of the body or space (contralateral neglect), which can impair many self-care skills such as dressing and washing. Right side damage can also cause difficulty in making things (constructional apraxia), denial of deficits (anosognosia) and drawing ability. [...] Neglect syndrome tends to be more prevalent on the right side of the parietal lobe, because the right mediates attention to both the left and right fields. [...] Damage in the somatic sensory cortex results in loss of perception of bodily sensations, namely sense of touch.|$|E

40|$|Gerstmann’s {{syndrome}} {{includes the}} clinical tetrad of finger agnosia, agraphia, <b>acalculia,</b> and right–left confusion. Some disagreement remains {{with regard to}} the exact localization of the syndrome, but most probable it involves the left angular gyrus with a subcortical extension. Several authors have suggested that a defect in mental spatial rotations could simultaneously account for <b>acalculia,</b> right–left disorientation, and finger agnosia. It has been also suggested that semantic aphasia is always associated with acalculia; as a matter of fact, left angular gyrus has a significant involvement in semantic processing. In this paper, it is proposed that Gerstmann’s syndrome should include: <b>acalculia,</b> finger agnosia, right–left disorientation, and semantic aphasia, but not agraphia. When the pathology extends toward the superior parietal gyrus, agra-phia can be found.

40|$|A {{historical}} {{review of}} calculation abilities is presented. Counting, starting with finger sequencing, {{has been observed}} in different ancient and contemporary cultures, whereas number representation and arithmetic abilities are found only during the last 5000 – 6000 years. The rationale for selecting a base of ten in most numerical systems and the clinical association between <b>acalculia</b> and finger agnosia are analyzed. Finger agnosia (as a restricted form of autotopagnosia), right–left discrimination disturbances, semantic aphasia, and <b>acalculia</b> are proposed to comprise a single neuropsychological syndrome associated with left angular gyrus damage. A classification of calculation disturbances resulting from brain damage is presented. It is emphasized that using historical/anthropological analysis, it becomes evident that <b>acalculia,</b> finger agnosia, and disorders in right–left discrimination (as in general, {{in the use of}} spatial concepts) must constitute a single clinical syndrome, resulting from the disruption of some common brain activity and the impairment of common cognitive mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the case of}} a right-handed patient who presented a severe <b>acalculia</b> {{in the context of a}} pure Gerstmann syndrome following a subangular lesion that spared the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL). The patient showed impairments in Arabic and verbal codes, in number production and comprehension, as well as in numerical facts and problem solving. By using the EC 301 calculation battery, semantic and syntactic tasks in Arabic and verbal codes, we tested the different hypotheses raised by the cognitive neuropsychological models of <b>acalculia.</b> The patients' difficulties, which were not associated with a general intellectual deterioration, and those affecting number processing as a particular semantic class, were indicative of a "global acalculia". This deficit, which exceeded the anarithmetia usually described in Gerstmann syndrome following left IPL lesion, suggested that the isolation of this area may constitute a sufficient condition for producing such a global <b>acalculia.</b> These results are discussed in terms of a disorder in the manipulation of mental images of spatially related objects...|$|E

40|$|Some {{recent studies}} on <b>acalculia</b> raise the {{question}} of how people translate verbal numerals (e. g. three hundred and sixty five) into Arabic numerals (365). This ability can conveniently be tested by a dictation task: The experimenter presents a spoken verbal numeral which the subject must write down in Arabic digits. Two broad categories of dictation error have been observed in <b>acalculia</b> studies. First, the patient may select a wrong digit (“lexical“ error, e. g. 364); secondly, he may produce a numeral with the wrong overall structure, in particular by inserting the wrong number of zeros (“syntactic” error, e. g. 30065). The present study examines another source of evidence, the performance of children who {{are in the process of}} acquiring this ability (the crucial age is around 6 - 8 years). A total of 15 Italian children were given a graded dictation test for numbers below 1 million. In comparison with <b>acalculia</b> patients, the most striking result was the overwhelming preponderance of syntactic errors of 128 errors scored, 111 were classified as syntactic and only 3 as lexical. The most common syntactic error was the insertion of extra zeros (e. g. 30065 or 3065 instead of 365). A formal theory explaining such errors is proposed. According to the theory, the production of an Arabic numeral like 365 requires the combination of 300 and 65 by a string operation which we call “over-writing”; children who have not yet learned this operation tend to fall back on concatenation...|$|E
