40|$|AbstractMobile <b>apps</b> <b>development</b> {{has been}} gaining {{popularity}} in Malaysia over the past 3 years. An app usually refers to a software application or programme. Although the development of software applications {{have been around for}} decades, <b>app</b> <b>development</b> on mobile devices reached the shores of Malaysia, mainly due to the popularity of Apple's <b>App</b> Store. Software <b>development</b> and complex object-oriented programming have been the exclusive harbour of technology hobbyists, IT professionals and business executives for many years. The flourishing presence of Web applications and the over-whelming influence of social media has augmented our need for greater connectivity, sharing and online presence. These have allowed smartphones and gadgets to become mainstream. This paper looks at how a design institution in Malaysia provides the growth of mobile <b>apps</b> <b>development,</b> and <b>in</b> supporting the national agenda to drive the Malaysian web and mobile application development industry to global standards.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the integration of}} Bayesian non-parametric mixture models, massively parallel computing on GPUs and software <b>development</b> <b>in</b> <b>Python</b> to provide an extensible toolkit for automated statistical analysis in high-dimensional flow cytometry (FCM). The use of standard Bayesian non-parametric Dirichlet process mixture models allows the flexible density estimation of the posterior distribution (MCMC) or modes (EM) of high-dimensional FCM data, and provides a coherent statistical framework for data analysis and interpretation (1, 2, 3). By exploiting the massively parallel nature of GPUs to achieve greater than 100 fold speed-ups over serial code, it is now realistic to perform large scale data analysis using these methods (4). To facilitate dissemination to the computational cytometry community, the statistical and computational foundations have been wrapped into fcm (5), a Python library that makes it simple to design and implement analysis and visualization pipelines for FCM (6). Used interactively, Python is ideal for rapid prototyping and algorithm <b>development.</b> <b>In</b> addition, <b>Python</b> has robust support for databases, networking, XML processing, GUIs and web development, facilitating the development of full stack applications (7).

40|$|Contemporary {{approaches}} to cross-platform mobile application development, such as hybrid apps from PhoneGap and generated native apps from Xamarin, show promise <b>in</b> reducing <b>development</b> time towards Android, iOS and other platforms. At the same time, {{studies show that}} there are various problems associated with these approaches, including suffering user experiences and codebases {{that are difficult to}} maintain and test properly. In this thesis, a novel prototype framework called Building Blocks was developed with the purpose of investigating the feasibility of utilizing component-based software engineering in solving this problem. The prototype was developed towards Android along with a web interface that allowed users to assemble an Android app using software components. The report concludes that component-based software engineering can be – and already is – utilized successfully to improve cross-platform mobile <b>app</b> <b>development</b> with special regards to user experience. Qualitative data indicate that Building Blocks as a concept is flexible and shows promise for mobile <b>app</b> <b>development</b> <b>in</b> which functionality is often reused, such as enterprise apps. Rapid prototyping using the web-based visual editing tool was another promising area. However, future use of Building Blocks would require further work on the prototype to improve its ease of use. ...|$|R
