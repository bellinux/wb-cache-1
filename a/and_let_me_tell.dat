500|$|I'm {{proud of}} my service to this country. If you love your country, you serve her. During a time of war, {{during a time of}} {{economic}} hardship, when asked to serve your country in a sensitive position where you can actually bring a background to help your nation, I'm the kind of person who's going to stand up and do it, and I'll take that philosophy to my grave... In terms of the stimulus you talked about, it was failed. [...] <b>And</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you what I talked about with respect to the stimulus. I talked about the need for more tax cuts in the stimulus... We had done historic tax cuts. We created a flat tax in the state of Utah, exactly what needs to happen in this country. We got the economy moving. We became the number-one job creator in this nation and the best managed state. That's exactly what needs to happen in this nation. I am running on my record, and I am proud to run on my record.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "Obamacare" [...] was {{originally}} coined by opponents as a pejorative. The term emerged in March 2007 when healthcare lobbyist Jeanne Schulte Scott {{used it in}} a health industry journal, writing [...] "We will soon see a 'Giuliani-care' and 'Obama-care' {{to go along with}} 'McCain-care', 'Edwards-care', and a totally revamped and remodeled 'Hillary-care' from the 1990s". According to research by Elspeth Reeve, the expression was used in early 2007, generally by writers describing the candidate's proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured. It first appeared in a political campaign by Mitt Romney in May 2007 in Des Moines, Iowa. Romney said, [...] "In my state, I worked on healthcare for some time. We had half a million people without insurance, and I said, 'How can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over healthcare?' <b>And</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you, if we don't do it, the Democrats will. If the Democrats do it, it will be socialized medicine; it'll be government-managed care. It'll be what's known as Hillarycare or Barack Obamacare, {{or whatever you want to}} call it." ...|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{headed for}} a group of Japanese aircraft, and due to a {{combination}} of clouds and smoke, he unintentionally entered the middle of the formation of seven or eight A6M Zeros. A Japanese rear-gunner from a dive bomber fired at Taylor's aircraft and one of the bullets came within an inch of Taylor's head and exploded in the cockpit. One piece went through his left arm and shrapnel entered his leg. Taylor reflected on the injuries in a 2001 interview, saying [...] "It was of no consequence; it just {{scared the hell out of}} me for a minute." [...] A few years after the interview, Taylor received from his crew chief two other slugs that had been found behind his seat. Welch shot down the dive bomber aircraft that had injured Taylor, and Taylor damaged another aircraft (his second probable kill) before pulling away to assist Welch with a pursuing A6M Zero fighter. The Zero and the rest of its formation soon broke off the pursuit and left to return to their carriers as Taylor neared Welch. Taylor continued to fire on several Japanese aircraft until he ran out of ammunition. Both pilots headed back to Haleiwa. After landing and driving back to Wheeler, Taylor and Welch passed by their squadron commander, Major Gordon H. Austin, who noticed that they were wearing their tuxedo attire. Unaware of their earlier dogfights, he shouted at the two men, saying [...] "Get back to Haleiwa! You know there's a war on?" [...] The two pilots explained what they had done, and the commander thanked them. In a 2003 interview, Taylor reflected on his actions: [...] "I wasn't in the least bit terrified, <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you why: I was too young and too stupid to realize that I was in a lot of danger." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{her husband}} became president, Julia reconsidered surgery. [...] “I {{never had the}} courage to consent, but now that my husband had become so famous I really thought it behooved me to try to look as well as possible.” [...] Ulysses objected: “Did I not see you and fall in love with you with these same eyes? I like them just as they are, and now, remember, you are not to {{interfere}} with them. They are mine, <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you, Mrs. Grant, you had better not make any experiments, as I might not like you half so well with any other eyes.” ...|$|E
2500|$|After recovering, Packer donated {{a large sum}} to the Ambulance Service of New South Wales to pay for {{equipping}} all NSW ambulances with {{a portable}} defibrillator (now colloquially known as [...] "Packer Whackers"). He told Nick Greiner [...] "I'll go you 50/50", and the NSW State government paid {{the other half of}} the cost. [...] In a press conference he later remarked on his temporary oblivion [...] "I've been to the other side <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you, son, there's fucking nothing there...there's no one waiting there for you, there's no one to judge you so you can do what you bloody well like".|$|E
2500|$|Unarguably {{the most}} popular {{to emerge from the}} Padilla showbiz clan's third generation, Padilla is aware that he has {{inherited}} the trademark bad boy swagger of his elders. However, while he may look the part of a heartthrob oozing with self-confidence, Daniel has said he's not the arrogant teen others perceive him to be. People see the vibe Padilla gives like his uncle, Robin Padilla. Though flattered, he has said that he also wants to be known for being simply himself. Mariah Carey, during her Manila leg of the [...] "Me. I Am" [...] tour, commented on Padilla, [...] "Everyone was talking about this singer named Daniel Padilla, so I went to his concert <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you, that boy is fine." ...|$|E

2500|$|Judge also {{hated the}} poster that the studio created for Office Space (which portrayed an office worker {{completely}} covered in Post-it notes). He said, [...] "People were like, 'What is this? A big bird? A mummy? A beekeeper?' And the tagline 'Work Sucks'? It {{looked like an}} Office Depot ad. I just hated it. I hated the trailers, too and the TV ads especially". Fox Filmed Entertainment chairman Tom Rothman conceded that the marketing campaign did not work and said, [...] "Office Space isn't like American Pie. It doesn't {{have the kind of}} jokes you put in a 15-second television spot of somebody getting hit on the head with a frying pan. It's sly. <b>And</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you, sly is hard to sell".|$|E
2500|$|Schembechler {{thought so}} much of Revelli’s {{performance}} that he invited him back every year to teach the freshmen what Michigan tradition was about. [...] Schembechler recalled, “He was absolutely great, and the freshmen absolutely loved it. [...] <b>And</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you, {{every one of those}} freshmen came out of that session with Revelli knowing ‘The Victors.’ [...] They knew the words, they knew how to sing it, and they knew how to emphasize the right spots. [...] They flat out knew how to do it. [...] And it was only because he came over there with the idea that those guys were {{going to come out of}} that meeting room knowing how to sing this fight song the right way or else! [...] And they did. [...] That was Bill Revelli.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Subsequently, in the 2008 series, the Doctor's {{friendship}} with Donna Noble is strengthened, after the infatuations with Martha and Rose, {{by the knowledge}} that she has no romantic interest in him whatsoever. Davies' last clear allusion to the Doctor's romantic capacity occurs {{at the beginning of his}} last episode as showrunner, The End of Time. The Tenth Doctor claims to have married [...] "Good Queen Bess, <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you, her nickname is no longer... (clears throat)", a reference to Elizabeth I of England's nickname [...] "The Virgin Queen". The marriage, which is referred to as [...] "a mistake", explained Queen Elizabeth's reaction to seeing the Tenth Doctor in an earlier episode, [...] "The Shakespeare Code". Subsequent episodes have alluded to this romantic, possibly sexual relationship. This relationship, including the marriage and the [...] "mistake" [...] which led to it (a case of mistaken identity involving a Zygon commander in 1562), eventually unfolds on screen in [...] "The Day of the Doctor".|$|E
6000|$|... "It 's {{a million}} times better, but it knocked me worse than the other; {{kindness}} always does." [...] Tom stopped short there, and stood a minute turning the letter about in his hand as if it contained a sweet which neutralized the bitter in that smaller note, and touched him very much. Then he drew up an arm-chair, and beckoning Polly to take it, said in a sober, steady tone, that surprised her greatly, [...] "Whenever I was in a quandary, I used to go and consult grandma, and she always had something sensible or comfortable to say to me. She 's gone now, but somehow, Polly, you seem to take her place. Would you mind sitting in her chair, <b>and</b> <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you two or three things, as Will does?" ...|$|R

Not only you, {{but another}} also, whose {{judgement}} I care for, perhaps, more than yours; <b>and</b> that, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you, is saying a great deal. You do condemn me, Dr. Thorne, and I also condemn myself. It {{is not that}} I have done wrong, but the game is not worth the candle." ...|$|R

Your whole life, like a sandglass, will always be reversed and will ever run out again, - a long minute of time will elapse until all those conditions out of which you were evolved return in the wheel of the cosmic process. And then you will find every pain and every pleasure, every friend and every enemy, every hope and every error, every blade of grass and every ray of sunshine once more, and the whole fabric of things which make up your life. This ring in which you are but a grain will glitter afresh forever. And in every one of these cycles of human life there will be one hour where, for the first time one man, and then many, will perceive the mighty thought of the eternal recurrence of all things:- and for mankind this is always the hour of Noon".|$|E
