5|$|Declassified wartime {{documents}} show that Simonds, {{along with several}} others in the Allied high command, had likely been notified on July 23 of a massive German buildup on the ridge. Some historians, including David O'Keefe and David Bercuson, accused Simonds of being careless with {{the lives of his}} men. Terry Copp and John A. English, wrote that given the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> that all Allied commanders were under to break out from Normandy, Simonds probably had little choice in the decision he made.|$|E
5|$|In the semi-finals on 5 August, Phiri {{achieved}} a fifth-place finish in heat two {{with a time}} of 10:11 seconds, which was his best of the 2012 athletic season. He finished in front of Daniel Bailey from Antigua and Barbuda (10.12 seconds) in a heat won by eventual gold medallist Usain Bolt of Jamaica (9.87 seconds). Overall he finished 15th out of 75th athletes overall and was unable to progress further because his time was 0.09 seconds slower than the slowest competitor who advanced to the first round. After the event Phiri said he placed a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> onto himself but was not good enough in the event. Nevertheless, he thanked the people who supported him.|$|E
5|$|Although {{horse and}} ox-drawn carts and spoke-wheeled chariots had existed in China {{long before the}} Han dynasty, {{it was not until}} the 1st century BCE that {{literary}} evidence pointed to the invention of the wheelbarrow, while painted murals on Han tomb walls of the 2nd century CE show the wheelbarrow in use for hauling goods. While the 'throat-and-girth' harness was still in use throughout much of the ancient world (placing an excessive <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> on horses' necks), the Chinese were placing a wooden yoke across their horses' chests with traces to the chariot shaft by the 4th century BCE in the State of Chu (as seen on a Chu lacquerware). By Han times, the Chinese replaced this heavy yoke with a softer breast strap, as seen in Han stamped bricks and carved tomb reliefs. In the final stage of evolution, the modern horse collar was invented in China by the 5th century CE, during the Northern Wei period.|$|E
2500|$|Standardized tests put large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> on students. Some {{children}} who are considered {{at the top of}} their class choke when it comes to standardized tests such as the citywide.|$|R
50|$|Core shroud {{walls are}} {{relatively}} thin, ranging {{from three to}} five centimeters in thickness. This is because the core shroud is not built to withstand high <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> {{for long periods of}} time, so thicker walls would be unnecessary for the core shroud's function.|$|R
50|$|Viscous Deformation is when rocks behave and deform {{more like}} a fluid than a solid. This often occurs under great <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> and at very high temperatures. In viscous deformation, stress is {{proportional}} to the strain rate, and each rock sample has its own material property called its Viscosity. Unlike elastic deformation, viscous deformation is permanent even after the stress has been removed.|$|R
25|$|Pump: The pump in the ABS is used {{to restore}} the {{pressure}} to the hydraulic brakes after the valves have released it. A signal from the controller will release the valve at the detection of wheel slip. After a valve release the pressure supplied from the user, the pump {{is used to}} restore a desired <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> to the braking system. The controller will modulate the pumps status {{in order to provide}} the desired <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> and reduce slipping.|$|E
25|$|Slip joint â€“ Found most {{commonly}} on traditional pocket knives, the opened blade does not lock, but {{is held in}} place by a spring device that allows the blade to fold if a certain <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> is applied.|$|E
25|$|Automatic {{positive}} airway pressure (APAP) {{is a form}} of CPAP {{that automatically}} tunes the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> delivered to the patient to the minimum required to maintain an unobstructed airway on a breath-by-breath basis by measuring the resistance in the patient's breathing.|$|E
50|$|The {{carbonation}} {{of water}} is also reliant upon the behavior of supersaturated solutions. In this case, the solution is supersaturated with a gas. To create sodas and seltzer water, carbon dioxide gas is forced to dissolve in water beyond its saturation point. This is done by applying high <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> to the gas {{in the presence of}} water followed by sealing the system in an airtight manner.|$|R
50|$|Since Captain America and Falcon now possess both O.N.I.'s rogue {{agent and}} the last {{remaining}} sample of O.N.I.'s virus, O.N.I. begins to put increasing <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> on the heroes. Falcon is especially targeted - he had broken Leila out of Federal Custody, and his criminal history {{makes it easier for}} O.N.I. to create further false charges against him. Falcon soon finds himself on the run from O.N.I.|$|R
50|$|The third {{metacarpal}} styloid process {{enables the}} hand bone to lock into the wrist bones, allowing for greater <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> {{to be applied}} to the wrist and hand from a grasping thumb and fingers. It allows humans the dexterity and strength to make and use complex tools. This unique anatomical feature separates humans from apes and other nonhuman primates, and is not seen in human fossils older than 1.8 million years.|$|R
25|$|The initial {{prediction}} {{about the}} <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> needed was eventually {{shown to be}} too low. Since the first work by Wigner and Huntington, the more modern theoretical calculations were pointing toward higher but nonetheless potentially accessible metallization pressures of 100 GPa and higher.|$|E
25|$|The {{important}} spark {{characteristics are}} color, volume, {{nature of the}} spark, and length. Note that the length {{is dependent on the}} <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> applied to the grinding wheel, so this can be a poor comparison tool if the pressure is not exactly the same for the samples. Also, the grinding wheel must be dressed frequently to remove metallic build-up.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} these {{differences}} will be magnified or minimized based on the initial condition of the fruit after harvest (with moldy, damaged, sun-burnt or botryized grapes producing stark differences between free-run and pressed juice), the type of press used, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> involved and the overall amount of movement that the grapes are subject to that could impact how much the skins and seeds are scoured and torn.|$|E
5000|$|Devices {{that use}} SNP {{technology}} require specific <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> air <b>pressure</b> to be [...] "sipped" [...] or [...] "puffed" [...] by the user. These <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> are typically denoted as a hard sip/hard puff or soft sip/soft puff, however other terminologies might exist. Note {{that the words}} [...] "hard" [...] and [...] "soft" [...] are relative to the user and depend on their breathing abilities. Typically, air pressure levels pertaining to hard sips/puffs and soft sips/puffs are set through an initial calibration <b>of</b> the <b>pressure</b> sensor completed before the user starts to use their SNP device. With the assistance of an aid or technician, the user will program the SNP device to recognize their body's ability to produce hard sips/puffs and soft sips/puffs. Once this calibration process is complete, the SNP device will only recognize the user specific sips and puffs that have been saved into the SNP device.|$|R
50|$|Each key on a mechanical-switch {{keyboard}} {{contains a}} complete switch underneath. Each switch {{is composed of}} a base, a spring, and a stem. Switches come in three variants: linear with consistent resistance, and tactile with a non-audible bump, or tactile with an audible click. Depending on {{the resistance of the}} spring, the key requires different <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> to actuate. The shape of the stem varies the actuation distance and travel distance <b>of</b> the switch.The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> sound produced by actuation can also be changed. Mechanical keyboards allow for the removal and replacement of keycaps.|$|R

25|$|The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> in {{the boiler}} can be {{monitored}} by a gauge {{mounted in the}} cab and excessive steam pressure can be released manually by the driver or fireman. Alternatively, in conditions of high boiler pressure, a safety valve may be triggered to reduce pressure and prevent the boiler bursting violently, which had previously resulted in injuries and fatalities to nearby individuals, as well as extensive damage to the locomotive and nearby structures.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, Saudi blogger Raif Badawi's {{sentence}} was increased to 1000 lashes and 10 years imprisonment {{after he was}} accused of apostasy in 2012. The lashes were due to take place over 20 weeks. The first round (50) were administered on January 9, 2015, but the second round has been postponed due to medical problems. The case has been internationally condemned and has put a considerable <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> on the Saudi legal system.|$|E
25|$|Sleeping in the supine {{position}} {{is believed to}} make the sleeper more vulnerable to episodes of sleep paralysis because in this sleeping position {{it is possible for}} the soft palate to collapse and obstruct the airway. This is a possibility regardless of whether the individual has been diagnosed with sleep apnea or not. There may also be a greater rate of microarousals while sleeping in the {{supine position}} because there is a greater <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> being exerted on the lungs by gravity.|$|E
5000|$|To use the technique, the {{gradient}} coils in the MRI equipment need to {{be driven}} with special pulse sequences, designed for specific tissues, that [...] "tags" [...] deformation of the tissue, such that tissue that deforms more is brighter, or darker, as needed. Using a baseline measurement of normal deformation, the measurements can show unusual <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> a tissue is exposed to, or indicate that the tissue is unusually stiff or flexible, in either case potentially revealing a pathology.|$|R
30|$|Regarding low {{permeability}} in the full-bore DST, increasing the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> injected <b>pressure</b> due to increasing <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> injected rate is suggested; {{in respect of}} the way, these procedures need the appropriate studies owing to determining the formation fracture gradient.|$|R
50|$|Further to the {{outbreak}} of the Panama Papers, where the already mentioned Mizzi and Keith Schembri, the Chief of Staff within the Office of the Prime Minister were included as owners of a Panama company, together with an unnamed owner of a third company, the Maltese government was receiving copious <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> by civil society, spearheaded by blogger Daphne Caruana Galizia, but also by the Nationalist Party, especially Leader of the Opposition Simon Busuttil. Nexia BT, a Maltese audit firm, claimed ownership of Egrant.|$|R
25|$|Individuals {{who make}} their own bullets usually {{are not aware of}} {{available}} manual specialized equipment and dies required for swaging bullets, and thus choose to make cast bullets. To get high precision results, it is common to cast the bullets slightly oversized, then swage the resulting castings through a die to do the final forming. Since the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> required to size the bullet is far less than that required to form a bullet, a simple mechanical press can be used, often the same press used for handloading ammunition.|$|E
25|$|The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> applied (and speed) {{will depend}} on the winemakers {{preference}} with additional pressure increasing the likelihood that the skins and seeds of the grapes will be scoured and torn, releasing tannins and other phenolic compounds that could make the juice more astringent and bitter. Typically mechanized batch presses will begin at less than 1 bar (slightly less than 1 atm) of pressure and gradually increase to a maximum of 4 to 6 bars over a course of 1 to 2 hours. The slower that the pressure is applied and gradually increased, the more gentle the overall pressing will be.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{trade off}} between the high volume and {{throughput}} that continuous presses can manage versus {{the overall quality}} of the press juice compared to the potentially more delicate means of some batch presses. However, there are noticeable difference in the composition of the pressed juice from continuous presses that are taken {{from the beginning of the}} press (the 1st press section) with the least <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> and movement versus the fractions that come further down the path. Often winemakers will have separate press pans under each section that they will keep apart and vinify separately.|$|E
50|$|Dry-ice {{blasting}} {{technology can}} trace its roots to conventional abrasive blasting. The differences between an abrasive-blasting machine and a dry-ice blasting machine are {{in how they}} handle the blast media. Unlike sand or other media, dry ice is generally used at its sublimation temperature. This means that a pressurized hopper system could potentially build up dangerous <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> (see dry ice bomb). Other differences include systems for preventing the ice from forming snowball-like jams, and different materials to allow operation at very low temperatures.|$|R
50|$|Even though {{socially}} accepted {{children often}} {{have the most}} opportunities and the most positive experiences, research shows that social acceptance (being in the popular crowd) may {{increase the likelihood of}} engaging in risky behavior, depending on the norms in the group. Groups of popular children showed a propensity to increase risky, drug-related and delinquent behavior when this behavior was likely to receive approval in their groups. Peer pressure was greatest among more popular children because they were the children most attuned to the judgments of their peers, making them more susceptible to group pressures. Gender also has a clear effect on the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> peer <b>pressure</b> an adolescent experiences: girls report significantly higher pressures to conform to their groups in the form of clothing choices or speech patterns. Additionally, girls and boys reported facing differing <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressures</b> in different areas of their lives, perhaps reflecting a different set of values and priorities for each gender.|$|R
5000|$|Germany {{looked on}} Romania as an {{important}} supplier of war material, notably oil and grain. Looking to secure Romania as an ally, throughout {{the middle of the}} 1930s Germany placed increasing <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> on them in a variety of forms, best summed up as the [...] "carrot and stick" [...] approach. The carrot {{came in the form of}} generous trade agreements for a variety of products and by the late 1930s Germany formed about half of all of Romania's trade. The stick came in the form of Germany siding with Romania's enemies in various disputes.|$|R
25|$|Muscle strain {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{injuries}} in tennis. When an isolated large-energy appears during the muscle contraction and at the same time body weight apply huge <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> to the lengthened muscle which can result in the occurrence of muscle strain. Inflammation and bleeding are triggered when muscle strain occur which resulted in redness, pain and swelling. Overuse is also common in tennis players from all level. Muscle, cartilage, nerves, bursae, ligaments and tendons may be damaged from overuse. The repetitive use of a particular muscle without time for repair and recover in the most common case among the injury.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, Sonor drum company {{introduced}} its first single bass drum pedal. William F. Ludwig made the bass drum pedal workable in 1909, {{paving the way}} for the modern drum kit. A bass drum pedal operates much the same as the hi-hat control; a footplate is pressed to pull a chain, belt, or metal drive mechanism downward, bringing a beater or mallet forward into the drumhead. The beater head is usually made of either felt, wood, plastic, or rubber and is attached to a rod-shaped metal shaft. The pedal and beater system are mounted in a metal frame and like the hi-hat, a tension unit controls the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> needed to strike and the amount of recoil upon release.|$|E
25|$|In {{white wine}} production, {{pressing}} usually takes place immediately after crushing or/and before primary fermentation. In red wine production, the grapes are also crushed but pressing usually doesn't take place till after {{or near the}} end of fermentation with the time of skin contact between the juice and grapes leaching color, tannins and other phenolics from the skin. Approximately 60-70% of the available juice within the grape berry, the free-run juice, can be released by the crushing process and doesn't require the use of the press. The remaining 30-40% that comes from pressing can have higher pH levels, lower titratable acidity, potentially higher volatile acidity and higher phenolics than the free-run juice depending on the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> and tearing of the skins and will produce more astringent, bitter wine.|$|E

50|$|Imagine an overdense {{region of}} the {{primordial}} plasma. While this region of overdensity gravitationally attracts matter towards it, the heat of photon-matter interactions creates a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> outward <b>pressure.</b> These counteracting forces <b>of</b> gravity and <b>pressure</b> created oscillations, analogous to sound waves created in air by pressure differences.|$|R
