5|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, the {{development}} of antiviral drugs has increased rapidly, mainly driven by the <b>AIDS</b> <b>pandemic.</b> Antiviral drugs are often nucleoside analogues, which are molecules very similar, but not identical to DNA building blocks. When the replication of virus DNA begins, some of these fake building blocks are incorporated. As soon as that happens, replication stops prematurely—the fake building blocks lack the essential features that allow the addition of further building blocks. Thus, DNA production is halted, and the virus can no longer reproduce. Examples of nucleoside analogues are aciclovir for herpes virus infections and lamivudine for HIV and hepatitis B virus infections. Aciclovir {{is one of the}} oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs.|$|E
40|$|Influenza pandemics have {{occurred}} throughout history and {{were associated with}} substantial excess mortality and morbidity. Mathematical models of infectious diseases permit quantitative description of epidemic processes based on the underlying biological mechanisms. Mathematical models {{have been widely used}} in the past decade to <b>aid</b> <b>pandemic</b> planning by allowing detailed predictions of the speed of spread of an influenza pandemic and the likely effectiveness of alternative control strategies. During the initial waves of the 2009 influenza pandemic, mathematical models were used to track the spread of the virus, predict the time course of the pandemic and assess the likely impact of large-scale vaccination. While mathematical modeling has made substantial contributions to influenza pandemic preparedness, its use as a realtime tool for pandemic control is currently limited by the lack of essential surveillance information such as serological data. Mathematical modeling provided a useful framework for analyzing and interpreting surveillance data during the 2009 influenza pandemic, for highlighting limitations in existing pandemic surveillance systems, and for guiding how these systems should be strengthened in order to cope with future epidemics of influenza or other emerging infectious diseases. © 2011 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Vaccines {{that trigger}} an influenza-specific {{cytotoxic}} T cell (CTL) response may <b>aid</b> <b>pandemic</b> control {{by limiting the}} transmission of novel influenza A viruses (IAV). We consider interventions with hypothetical CTL-inducing vaccines {{in a range of}} epidemiologically plausible pandemic scenarios. We estimate the achievable reduction in the attack rate, and, by adopting a model linking epidemic progression to the emergence of IAV variants, the opportunity for antigenic drift. We demonstrate that CTL-inducing vaccines have limited utility for modifying population-level outcomes if influenza-specific T cells found widely in adults already suppress transmission and prove difficult to enhance. Administration of CTL-inducing vaccines that are efficacious in "influenza-experienced" and "influenza-naive" hosts can likely slow transmission sufficiently to mitigate a moderate IAV pandemic. However if neutralising cross-reactive antibody to an emerging IAV are common in influenza-experienced hosts, as for the swine-variant H 3 N 2 v, boosting CTL immunity may be ineffective at reducing population spread, indicating that CTL-inducing vaccines are best used against novel subtypes such as H 7 N 9. Unless vaccines cannot readily suppress transmission from infected hosts with naive T cell pools, targeting influenza-naive hosts is preferable. Such strategies are of enhanced benefit if naive hosts are typically intensively mixing children and when a subset of experienced hosts have pre-existing neutralising cross-reactive antibody. We show that CTL-inducing vaccination campaigns may have greater power to suppress antigenic drift than previously suggested, and targeting adults may be the optimal strategy to achieve this when the vaccination campaign does not have the power to curtail the attack rate. Our results highlight the need to design interventions based on pre-existing cellular immunity and knowledge of the host determinants of vaccine efficacy, and provide a framework for assessing the performance requirements of high-impact CTL-inducing vaccines.

40|$|Publicly {{available}} influenza modeling {{tools are}} of limited use to hospitals and local communities in {{planning for a}} severe pandemic. We developed Panalysis, a new tool to estimate the likely healthcare consequences of a <b>pandemic</b> and to <b>aid</b> hospitals {{in the development of}} mitigation and response strategies. By way of example, we demonstrate how Panalysis can be used to plan for a 1918 -like flu pandemic. We discuss potential future applications of this tool. EFFECTIVE PLANNING FOR AN influenza pandemic at the hospital or community level requires the ability to project the impact of an outbreak on available local medical resources, such as inpatient hospital beds and mechanical ventilators. To make such projections, the planner must (1) make assumptions about the specific nature of the outbreak (e. g., attack rate, severity, duration, and epidemiologic curve), and (2) gather or estimate relevant information about the hospital’s capacity, capabilities, and resources. Since the specifics of a future pandemic are unknown and could vary over a wide range, different scenarios must be considered. The projected number of patients must be matched, day-by-day or week-by-week, with the resources projected to be available. These projections require thousands of individual calculations. Therefore, effective planning is facilitated by use of a computerized modeling tool that can quickly and accurately calculate the consequences of different scenarios. In addition to projecting the effects of an outbreak, such a tool also could be used to evaluate potential mitigation strategies and to guide response. The value of this tool would be expected to increase with the number of users, by providing a common modeling platform with a uniform set of input and result fields. Users would be able to compare assumptions, data inputs, and results. In addition, if the tool were widely used, a future web-based central database of compiled anonymous data could enable the development and use of benchmarks to further <b>aid</b> <b>pandemic</b> planning...|$|R

40|$|Influenza HA is {{the primary}} target of {{neutralizing}} antibodies during infection, and its sequence undergoes genetic drift and shift in response to immune pressure. The receptor binding HA 1 subunit of HA shows much higher sequence variability relative to the metastable, fusion-active HA 2 subunit, presumably because neutralizing antibodies are primarily targeted against the former in natural infection. We have designed an HA 2 -based immunogen using a protein minimization approach that incorporates designed mutations to destabilize the low pH conformation of HA 2. The resulting construct (HA 6) was expressed in Escherichia coli and refolded from inclusion bodies. Biophysical studies and mutational analysis of the protein indicate that it is folded into the desired neutral pH conformation competent to bind the broadly neutralizing HA 2 directed monoclonal 12 D 1, not the low pH conformation observed in previous studies. HA 6 was highly immunogenic in mice and the mice were protected against lethal challenge by the homologous A/HK/ 68 mouse-adapted virus. An HA 6 -like construct from another H 3 strain (A/Phil/ 2 / 82) also protected mice against A/HK/ 68 challenge. Regions included in HA 6 are highly conserved within a subtype and are fairly well conserved within a clade. Targeting the highly conserved HA 2 subunit with a bacterially produced immunogen is a vaccine strategy that may <b>aid</b> in <b>pandemic</b> preparedness...|$|R
40|$|Influenza A viruses {{belong to}} the best studied viruses, however no {{effective}} prevention against influenza infection has been developed. The emerging of still new escape variants of influenza A viruses causing epidemics and periodic worldwide pandemics represents a threat for human population. Therefore, current, hot task of influenza virus research {{is to look for}} a way how to get us closer to a universal vaccine. Combination of chosen conserved antigens inducing cross-protective antibody response with epitopes activating also cross-protective cytotoxic T-cells would offer an attractive strategy for improving protection against drift variants of seasonal influenza viruses and reduces the impact of future pandemic strains. Antigenically conserved fusion-active subunit of hemagglutinin (HA 2 gp) and ectodomain of matrix protein 2 (eM 2) are promising candidates for preparation of broadly protective HA 2 - or eM 2 -based vaccine that may <b>aid</b> in <b>pandemic</b> preparedness. Overall protective effect could be achieved by contribution of epitopes recognized by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) that have been studied extensively to reach much broader control of influenza infection. In this review we present the state-of-art in this field. We describe known adaptive immune mechanisms mediated by influenza specific B- and T-cells involved in the anti-influenza immune defense together with the contribution of innate immunity. We discuss the mechanisms of neutralization of influenza infection mediated by antibodies, the role of CTL in viral elimination and new approaches to develop epitope based vaccine inducing cross-protective influenza virus-specific immune response...|$|R

25|$|LaRouche {{interpreted}} the <b>AIDS</b> <b>pandemic</b> as fulfillment of his 1973 prediction that an epidemic would strike humanity in the 1980s. According to Christopher Toumey, his subsequent campaign followed a familiar LaRouche pattern: challenging the scientific competence of government experts, and arguing that LaRouche had special scientific insights, {{and his own}} scientific associates were more competent than government scientists. LaRouche's view of AIDS agreed with orthodox medicine in that HIV caused AIDS, but differed from it in arguing that HIV spread like the cold virus or malaria, by way of casual contact and insect bites—which, if true, would make HIV-positive people extremely dangerous. He advocated testing anyone working in schools, restaurants, or healthcare, and quarantining those who tested positive. Some of LaRouche's views on AIDS were developed by John Seale, a British venereological physician who proposed that AIDS was created in a Soviet laboratory. Seale's highly speculative writings were published in three prestigious medical journals, lending these ideas some appearance of being hard science.|$|E
