30|$|Apparently, {{a degree}} of {{electric}} collectivization of separate nanobatteries into plasma-united <b>aerosol</b> electrochemical <b>generator</b> can depend {{on a lot of}} linked conditions (e.g., on the temperature of nanobatteries, their form and concentration, {{a degree of}} the plasma ionization and a presence of ionized alkaline impurity, on magnetic permeability of nanobatteries, their gassing, on the currents of nanobatteries etc.). As the degree of electrical connection of the nanobatteries inside different <b>aerosol</b> electrochemical <b>generators</b> can be very various, electric power of such <b>aerosol</b> <b>generators</b> can also be alternatively redistributed either to maximal currents of separate nanobatteries, or to maximal voltage of dynamic voltaic piles of plasma-connected nanobatteries, or to intermediate values of currents and voltages adequate to complete electric power of the <b>aerosol</b> electrochemical <b>generator.</b>|$|R

40|$|Inhalation therapy is one of the main {{therapeutic}} modalities {{in modern}} pulmonology. It {{allows for the}} use of smaller daily doses of various medications which exhibit potent local therapeutic effects and low systemic action. Moreover, adverse effects, particularly the general (systemic) ones are minimal. The use of medical aerosols enables the treatment of not only diseases of the airways, but also makes it possible to deliver medicinal products that have a systemic effect (insulin, hormones, pain relievers or vaccines). The deposition of therapeutic molecules depends on a variety of factors (such as breath frequency, intensity of breathing or tidal volume). The greater the intensity of breathing (short, abrupt inspiration or a series of rapid shallow breaths), the greater the filtration ability of the upper airways (nasopharynx, larynx). These effects of the respiratory physiology should be always kept in mind since they are of key importance for a deposited (therapeutic) dose. The most common <b>aerosol</b> <b>generators</b> are pressurized metered dose inhalers and dry powder inhalers as well as nebulisers (jet, ultrasonic and MESH). All of these devices differ from one another in producing aerosol clouds (different particle diameters, different way of particle generation). That is why they cannot be used in all patients. Inhaler selection is one of the most important decisions in inhalation therapy. Its course and success are determined by multiple factors (patient-generated air flow, skill and ability to use <b>aerosol</b> <b>generators).</b> Prior to making a decision concerning treatment, an algorithm proposed by Laube et al. should be used since it makes inhaler selection considerably easier...|$|R
40|$|Animal {{studies to}} {{demonstrate}} efficacy of medical countermeasures against respiratory disease or biodefense threats require exposure of animals to aerosolized viruses and bacteria. Prior {{studies have shown}} that the choice of culture media and relative humidity in the aerosol chamber can impact the dose of infectious agent delivered to animals. Most infectious aerosol studies have involved the use of Collison jet nebulizers which create a small, relatively monodisperse aerosol that targets the deep lung. Collison nebulizers require a relatively large volume of infectious agent and the jets that create the aerosol may damage the agent being aerosolized. Damage resulting from the nebulizer can impact agent infectivity and virulence as well as study reproducibility. We compared the Blaustein Atomizing Module (BLAM) and the Aeroneb, a vibrating-mesh nebulizer, to the existing ‘gold standard’ Collison nebulizer for generation of small particle aerosols containing either a bacterium, F. tularensis, or a virus, influenza or Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) in different exposure chambers. Aerosol performance was assessed by comparing the spray factor (the ratio between the aerosol concentration of an agent and the concentration of the agent in the nebulizer), the reduction in pathogen viability, and the aerosol efficiency (the ratio of the actual aerosol concentration to the theoretical aerosol concentration. In the NOT, the Collison had superior aerosol performance compared to the BLAM and the Aeroneb, while the Aeroneb had superior aerosol performance comparted to the Collison in the whole-body and head-only chambers. Regression analysis revealed increased humidity was associated with improved aerosol performance of F. tularensis, but no environmental factors were associated with improved aerosol performance of influenza or RVFV. This data demonstrates that there is no ‘one size fits all’ choice for <b>aerosol</b> <b>generators,</b> and that further characterization of <b>aerosol</b> <b>generators</b> and factors that affect aerosol performance are needed to improve selection of aerosol equipment. The public health significance of this research is to contribute to the characterization of available <b>aerosol</b> <b>generators</b> to optimize <b>aerosol</b> experiments for a more robust experimental design for developing animal models of respiratory infections and developing therapeutics and vaccines against potential biological weapons...|$|R

50|$|Route 1: The {{traditional}} aerosolization reaction utilizes curium metal as {{the starting}} material. While curium metal has been discovered to naturally exist as a mixture of 87.4% 244Cm, 8.4% 243Cm, 3.9% other curium isotopes, and ~0.3% of the daughter nuclide, plutonium, in most aerosolized syntheses of curium(III) oxide, curium metal is purified through solvent extraction of curium nitrate and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid in toluene to remove the plutonium. NH3OH is then added to the purified curium nitrate, and the resulting precipitate is collected and rinsed with deionized water. The precipitate (Cm2O3) is resuspended in solvent and aerosolized {{with some sort of}} high output <b>aerosol</b> <b>generator</b> (ex: Lovelace nebulizer).|$|E
50|$|The {{first part}} of the process is to create the colloid {{precursor}} which consists of the silica nanoparticles and the solvent. The initial silica nanoparticles are in an amorphous crystalline phase and the solvent is composed of trimethylsilyl chloride (TMCS) and ethyl alcohol. To synthesize hydrophobic nanostructured silica using this method, the colloid precursor containing the solvent and silica particles is sprayed by an <b>aerosol</b> <b>generator.</b> The droplets are then transported by a carrier gas to a furnace where they are heated. Upon entry into the furnace, the ethyl alcohol evaporates from the colloid precursor, allowing self-assembly to occur between the silica particles and the surface treating agent, TMCS.|$|E
50|$|The precursor, {{typically}} a single- or mixed-metal alkoxide, or carboxylate dissolved in ethanol at 1-10 wt% is {{introduced to the}} combustion chamber via twin, high-shear fluid (Bernoulli) aerosol generators with oxygen as the atomizing gas. The <b>aerosol</b> <b>generator</b> is composed of a precursor delivery tube oriented perpendicularly to a high-velocity oxygen flow tube. The twin aerosol generators provide high throughput of the precursor solution and stabilize the flame. Two methane pilot torches made of alumina are used to ignite the aerosol. The ensuing combustion results in flame temperatures of 1500-2000 °C, depending on the solvent, precursor loading, and rate of aerosolization. The precursor vaporizes on combustion and subsequently gets converted to nanoparticles in the flame. Temperatures drop to 300-500 °C over a 1.5 m length of the combustion chamber, which is equivalent to a 1000 °C quench in ≤ 100 ms. The process leads to kinetic products and nanopowders that are largely unaggregated.|$|E

5000|$|The solid {{compound}} {{found inside}} the <b>aerosol</b> <b>generator</b> units uses environment friendly, naturally occurring potassium salts to extinguish fire by inhibiting the chemical chain reactions in the flame on a molecular level. On activation, the compound {{is transformed into}} a condensed aerosol consisting mainly of (K2CO3), (...) (vapor), N2 and CO2. The gas-type properties of the aerosol facilitate its even distribution in the protected volume as well as its flow into the natural convection currents of combustion. The solid particles of potassium salts, which are of a few microns in size, are suspended in an inert gas that displays a high surface to reaction mass ratio. When the aerosol reacts with the flame, Potassium radicals (K*) are formed mainly from the disassociation of (K2CO3). The K*s bind to other flame free radicals (hydroxyls - OH-) forming stable products such as KOH. This action extinguishes fire without depleting the ambient oxygen content. KOH reacts further in the presence of CO2 and forms (K2CO3). It is a sustainable approach that challenges conventional firefighting technologies of cooling, starvation or smothering. The physical and chemical characteristics of the technology do not pose a threat to humans or the environment. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has listed FirePro technology in its Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) under the stratospheric ozone protection provisions of the Clean Air Act. The Green Label scheme recommends that they are ozone-friendly and do not contain CFC’s. The National Aerospace Laboratory concludes [...] "that the Electronics Instrumentation test objects exposed to the action of the fire extinguishing agent FirePro have not been affected by their combined exposure to the condensed aerosol medium and to the exposure to a temperature/ humidity variation cycles." ...|$|E

40|$|An inhaler adapter {{has been}} {{designed}} for the characterization of the aerosol clouds from medical <b>aerosol</b> <b>generators</b> such as nebulizers, dry powder inhalers (dpis) and metered dose inhalers (mdis) with laser diffraction technology. The adapter has a pre-separator, for separation of large particles (i. e. carrier crystals) from the aerosol cloud before it is exposed to the laser beam. It also has a fine particle collector for measuring the emitted mass fraction of fines by chemical detection methods after laser diffraction sizing. The closed system enables flow control through the <b>aerosol</b> <b>generators</b> and all test conditions, including ambient temperature and relative humidity, are automatically recorded. Counter flows minimize particle deposition onto the two windows for the laser beam, which make successive measurements without cleaning of these windows possible. The adapter has successfully been tested for nebulizers, mdis and dpis. In a comparative study with ten nebulizers {{it was found that}} these devices, differ considerably in droplet size (distribution) of the aerosol cloud for the same 10 % aqueous tobramycin solution (volume median diameters ranging from 1. 25 to 3. 25 mum) when they are used under the conditions recommended by the manufacturers. The droplet size distribution generated by the Sidestream (with PortaNeb compressor) is very constant during nebulization until dry running of the device. Comparative testing of dpis containing spherical pellet type of formulations for the drug (e. g. the AstraZeneca Turbuhaler) with the adapter is fast and simple. But also formulations containing larger carrier material could successfully be measured. Disintegration efficiency of a test inhaler with carrier retainment (acting as a pre-separator) could be measured quite accurately both for a colistin sulfate formulation with 16. 7 % of a lactose fraction 106 - 150 mum and for a budesonide formulation with a carrier mixture of Pharmatose 325 and 150 M. Therefore, it is concluded that, with this special adapter, laser diffraction may be a valuable tool for comparative inhaler evaluation, device development, powder formulation and quality control. Compared to cascade impactor analysis, laser diffraction is much faster. In addition to that, more detailed and also different information about the aerosol cloud is obtained.
