30|$|Operator {{dependence}} is also {{an important}} consideration for (non-tractographic) ROI analyses of DTI data. For example, Lilja et al. [20] showed that in quantitative DTI analyses of the optical tracts, results differ according to which ROI method (manual or semi-automatic) is applied. Similarly, Foeling et al. [21] reported high operator dependence associated with ROI analyses, after considering the importance of various factors like the ROI definition, atlas-based analyses, effects of motion, registration, and spatial normalisation. In a comparison of voxel-based and manual ROI-based analyses of DTI data in children and young adults, Snook et al. [22] observed good correlation between the FA values derived with automated and manual methods. However, they noted differences between the two methods in sensitivity to age effects in certain brain regions, thought to be due to the effects of spatial normalisation and smoothing in the <b>voxel-based</b> <b>analyses.</b> Based on the apparent differences in results between the methods they concluded that both manual (ROI-based) and <b>voxel-based</b> <b>analyses</b> offer complementary insight into neurodevelopment.|$|R

One widely reported finding is that women demonstrate higher cerebral perfusion than men, but the underlying cause of this difference in perfusion is not known. This study investigated the putative role of steroid hormones such as oestradiol, testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) as underlying factors influencing cerebral perfusion. We acquired arterial spin labelling perfusion images of 36 healthy adult subjects (16 men, 20 women). Analyses on average whole brain perfusion levels included a multiple regression analysis to test for the relative impact of each hormone on the global perfusion. Additionally, <b>voxel-based</b> <b>analyses</b> were performed to investigate the sex difference in regional perfusion as well as the correlations between local perfusion and serum oestradiol, testosterone, and DHEAS concentrations. Our results replicated the known sex difference in perfusion, with women showing significantly higher global and regional perfusion. For the global perfusion, DHEAS was the only significant predictor amongst the steroid hormones, showing a strong negative correlation with cerebral perfusion. The <b>voxel-based</b> <b>analyses</b> revealed modest sex-dependent correlations between local perfusion and testosterone, in addition to a strong modulatory effect of DHEAS in cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar regions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Epileptic syndromes with {{continuous}} spikes {{and waves}} during sleep (CSWS) represent {{a wide spectrum}} of epileptic conditions associated with cognitive dysfunctions that have the EEG pattern of CSWS as a common feature. Reported are the results of <b>voxel-based</b> <b>analyses</b> of brain glucose metabolism performed in a group of 18 children with CSWS. METHODS: <b>Voxel-based</b> <b>analyses</b> of cerebral glucose metabolism were performed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). First, each patient was compared with a control group and the influence of age, epileptic activity, and corticosteroid treatment on metabolic abnormalities was studied. Also, disease-related changes in the contribution of a brain area to the level of metabolic activity in another brain area were investigated using pathophysiologic interactions in groups of patients compared with the control group. RESULTS: Individual SPM analyses identified three metabolic patterns: association of hypermetabolic and hypometabolic areas, hypometabolic areas only, and normal pattern. Age and intensity of awake interictal spiking did not significantly differ in patients showing focal hypermetabolism compared with the other ones. Treatment with corticosteroids was associated with absence of focal hypermetabolism. In the group of patients with hypermetabolic areas, analyses of pathophysiologic interactions showed disease-related altered functional connectivity between the parietal and frontal cortices. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral metabolic patterns are heterogeneous among patients with CSWS. This metabolic heterogeneity could be related to the use of corticosteroid treatment before PET. The parietofrontal altered connectivity observed in patients with hypermetabolism is interpreted as a phenomenon of remote inhibition of the frontal lobes induced by highly epileptogenic and hypermetabolic posterior cortex.

Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of interference-related neural events using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and <b>voxel-based</b> <b>analyses</b> (SPM 8). Evoked magnetic fields (EMFs) were acquired in 12 right-handed healthy subjects performing a color-word Stroop task. Behavioral results disclosed a classic interference effect with longer mean reaction times for incongruent than congruent stimuli. At the group level, EMFs' differences between incongruent and congruent trials spanned from 380 to 700  ms post-stimulus onset. Underlying neural sources were identified in the left pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and in the left posterior parietal cortex (PPC) confirming the role of these regions in conflict processing.

40|$|Background: We {{investigated}} {{the interaction between}} exposure to noise and smoking in relation to prevalence of hearing loss among women. Methods: A sample of women aged 20 – 49 years (n¼ 1, 723) from a population-based cross-sectional study <b>arried</b> <b>out</b> in Brazil in 2006 was examined. Hearing loss was assessed using a yes–no validated question. Biological interaction was analyzed using the additive scale and measured with interaction contrast ratio (ICR) and assessment of dose–response relationship. Results: The combined effect of exposure to noise and cigarette smoking on hearing loss (adjusted prevalence ratio (PRadj) ¼ 3. 94, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 2. 81, 5. 52) was greater than expected based on the additive single effects of smoking (PRadj¼ 1. 39, 95 % CI: 1. 07, 1. 81) and noise (PRadj¼ 2. 66, 95 % CI: 1. 86, 3. 82). ICR estimates were not statistically significant. The prevalence of hearing loss among noise-exposed women increased with duration of smoking (P trend ¼ 0. 026), number of cigarettes smoked per day (Ptrend ¼ 0. 034), cumulative tobacco use (Ptrend¼ 0. 030), and early age at smoking initiation (P trend ¼ 0. 047). Conclusions: Noise and smoking may have a combined effect on hearing loss but fur- ther studies are still needed. A dose–response relation of smoking for the noise effect among women is suggested...|$|R
