The most common <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> were memory problems followed by headaches, restlessness, tiredness and depression. <b>Adverse</b> <b>effects</b> were significantly higher in females, with females with low educational levels having significantly higher rates.

40|$|The {{goals of}} {{epilepsy}} therapy are to achieve seizure freedom while minimizing <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> of treatment. However, producing seizure-freedom is often overemphasized, {{at the expense}} of inducing <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> of treatment. All antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have the potential to cause dose-related, “neurotoxic” <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> (i. e., drowsiness, fatigue, dizziness, blurry vision, and incoordination). Such <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> are common, especially when initiating AED therapy and with polytherapy. Dose-related <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> may be obviated in most patients by dose reduction of monotherapy, reduction or elimination of polytherapy, or substituting for a better tolerated AED. Additionally, all older and several newer AEDs have idiosyncratic <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> which usually require withdrawal in an affected patient, including serious rash (i. e., Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis), hematologic dyscrasias, hepatotoxicity, teratogenesis in women of child bearing potential, bone density loss, neuropathy, and severe gingival hyperplasia. Unfortunately, occurrence of idiosyncratic AED <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> cannot be predicted or, in most cases, prevented in susceptible patients. This article reviews a practical approach for the definition and identification of <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> of epilepsy therapies, and reviews the literature demonstrating that <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> result in detrimental quality of life in epilepsy patients. Strategies for minimizing AED <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> by reduction or elimination of AED polytherapy, appropriately employing drugsparing therapies, and optimally administering AEDs are outlined, including tenets of AED selection, titration, therapeutic AED laboratory monitoring, and avoidance of chronic idiosyncratic <b>adverse</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{evaluate}} tolerability {{and course}} of <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> of antidepressants in elderly patients and {{to study the}} association between number and severity of <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> and age, physical comorbidity, antidepressant dose. and depression severity. DESIGN Double-blind, randomized controlled trial followed by an open treatment phase of 3 years. SETTING Psychiatric hospital in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS Eighty-one elderly depressed inpatients. INTERVENTION Patients were treated with venlafaxine or nortriptyline. MEASUREMENTS Frequency and severity of 43 individual <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> were assessed using the Symptom, Sign, Side-Effect Checklist. Severity of depression was assessed using the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale. RESULTS Both antidepressants were tolerated well, with no differences in clinical effectiveness, and most <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> decreased with time. The number and severity of <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> {{was not related to}} age or physical comorbidities. There was a significant relationship between the severity of depression and the severity of <b>adverse</b> <b>effects,</b> although the relationship between the dose of the antidepressant and the severity of the <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> was of only borderline statistical significance.

Once the nests are harvested, they are cleaned and sold to restaurants. Over the past twenty years, the high demand for the nests of these Aerodramus species has had an <b>adverse</b> <b>effect</b> on their populations.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, {{aripiprazole}} has been proposed as a potentially useful medication for tics in patients with Tourette syndrome (TS).

This study assessed the prevalence and characteristics of <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> resulting from the use of aripiprazole in a retrospective chart review of 29 patients with TS. Six patients (20. 7 %) discontinued aripiprazole because of the severity of specific <b>adverse</b> <b>effects.</b> The most commonly reported <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> were sedation (n = 9, 30 %) and sleep problems (n = 5, 17 %). In the majority of cases, <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> were not severe. There were no differences in demographic or clinical variables between the patients who did or did not experience <b>adverse</b> <b>effects.</b> The discontinuation rate of 20. 7 % suggests that aripiprazole is safe and reasonably well tolerated for use in TS.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The use of {{antidepressant}} {{medications and}} the resulting costs have increased dramatically in recent years, {{partly because of the}} introduction of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). An assessment of the clinical and economic aspects of SSRIs compared with the older tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) was initiated to generate information for purchasers of these drugs as well as clinicians. One component of this study was an examination of the <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> {{associated with the use of}} these drugs. METHODS: Searches of bibliographic databases (for January 1980 through May 1996) and manual scanning of both peer-reviewed publications and other documents were used to identify double-blind, randomized controlled trials involving at least one SSRI and one TCA. For the study of <b>adverse</b> <b>effects,</b> only trials that had at least 20 patients in each trial arm and that reported rates of <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> in both arms were retained. In total 84 trials reporting on 18 <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> were available. Meta-analyses were undertaken to calculate pooled differences in rates of <b>adverse</b> <b>effects.</b> The question of whether the method of eliciting information from patients about <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> made a difference in the findings was also examined. Finally, differences in drop-out rates due to <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> were calculated. RESULTS: The crude rates of occurrence of <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> ranged from 4 % (palpitations) to 26 % (nausea) for SSRIs and from 4 % (diarrhea) to 27 % (dry mouth) for TCAs. The differences in the rates of <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> between the 2 types of drugs ranged from 14 % more with SSRIs (for nausea) to 11 % more with TCAs (for constipation). The results did not depend on the method of eliciting information from patients. There were no statistically significant differences between drug classes in terms of drop-outs due to <b>adverse</b> <b>effects.</b> INTERPRETATION: SSRIs and TCAs are both associated with <b>adverse</b> <b>effects,</b> although the key effects differ between the drug classes. Further explanation of the <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> and their relation to discontinuation of medication will require better studies involving prospective collection of quality-of-life data...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background We {{would expect}} {{information}} on adverse drug reactions in randomised clinical trials {{to be easily}} retrievable from specific searches of electronic databases. However, complete retrieval of such information may not be straightforward, for two reasons. First, not all clinical drug trials provide data on the frequency of <b>adverse</b> <b>effects.</b> Secondly, not all electronic records of trials include terms in the abstract or indexing fields that enable us to select those with <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> data. We have determined how often automated search methods, using indexing terms and/or textwords in the title or abstract, would fail to retrieve trials with <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> data. Methods We used a sample set of 107 trials known to report frequencies of <b>adverse</b> drug <b>effects,</b> and measured the proportion that (i) were not assigned the appropriate <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> indexing terms in the electronic databases, and (ii) did not contain identifiable <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> textwords in the title or abstract. Results Of the 81 trials with records on both MEDLINE and EMBASE, 25 were not indexed for <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> in either database. Twenty-six trials were indexed in one database but not the other. Only 66 of the 107 trials reporting <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> data mentioned this in the abstract or title of the paper. Simultaneous use of textword and indexing terms retrieved only 82 / 107 (77 %) papers. Conclusions Specific search strategies based on <b>adverse</b> <b>effects</b> textwords and indexing terms will fail to identify {{nearly a quarter of}} trials that report on the rate of drug <b>adverse</b> <b>effects.</b> </p...|$|R
