25|$|Rosemary {{leaves are}} used as a {{flavoring}} in foods such as stuffings <b>and</b> <b>roast</b> lamb, pork, chicken and turkey. Fresh or dried leaves are used in traditional Mediterranean cuisine. They have a bitter, astringent taste and a characteristic aroma which complements many cooked foods. Herbal tea {{can be made from}} the leaves. When roasted with meats or vegetables, the leaves impart a mustard-like aroma with an additional fragrance of charred wood compatible with barbecued foods.|$|E
25|$|Sangiovese's high acidity and {{moderate}} alcohol {{makes it a}} very food-friendly wine {{when it comes to}} food and wine pairings. One of the classic pairings in Italian cuisine is tomato-based pasta and pizza sauces with a Sangiovese-based Chianti. Varietal Sangiovese or those with a smaller proportion of the powerful, full-bodied Cabernet blended in, can accentuate the flavours of relatively bland dishes like meatloaf <b>and</b> <b>roast</b> chicken. Herb seasoning such as basil, thyme and sage play off the herbal notes of the grapes. Sangiovese that has been subject to more aggressive oak treatment pairs well with grilled and smoked food. If Cabernet, Merlot or Syrah plays a dominant role, the food pairing option should treat the Sangiovese blend as one of those fuller-bodied reds and pair with heavier dishes such as steak and thick soups like ribollita and puréed bean soup.|$|E
25|$|First {{proposed}} by Trier in the 1930s, semantic field theory proposes {{that a group}} of words with interrelated meanings can be categorized under a larger conceptual domain. This entire entity is thereby known as a semantic field. The words boil, bake, fry, <b>and</b> <b>roast,</b> for example, would fall under the larger semantic category of cooking. Semantic field theory asserts that lexical meaning cannot be fully understood by looking at a word in isolation, but by looking at a group of semantically related words. Semantic relations can refer to any relationship in meaning between lexemes, including synonymy (big and large), antonymy (big and small), hypernymy and hyponymy (rose and flower), converseness (buy and sell), and incompatibility. Semantic field theory does not have concrete guidelines that determine the extent of semantic relations between lexemes. The abstract validity of the theory is a subject of debate.|$|E

After cutting, the leaves of M. citrifolia are subjected to drying <b>and</b> <b>roasting</b> steps. The steps are standard procedures commonly applied in food production and do not give rise to concern. Compositional data on various batches of dried <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> M. citrifolia leaves from French Polynesia have been provided. The information presented does not indicate detrimental nutritional effects to be expected from the consumption of tea infusions made from dried <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> M. citrifolia leaves. Under the applied analytical conditions none of the anthraquinones rubiadin, alizarin and lucidin could be detected in dried <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> M. citrifolia leaves (detection limits 0. 25, 0. 025 and 0. 4 mg/kg) and in infusions (detection limits 1. 04, 0. 1 and 1. 67 µg/l), respectively. 5, 15 -Dimethylmorindol, an anthraquinone previously isolated from the fruits of M. citrifolia, was shown to be present in dried <b>and</b> <b>roasted</b> M. citrifolia leaves at concentrations ranging from 11. 3 to 42. 6 mg/kg.

25|$|The {{precursor}} of the Folger Coffee Company {{was founded in}} 1850 in San Francisco, California, U.S., as the Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. The owner, William H. Bovee, saw an opportunity to produce roasted and ground coffee ready for brewing. Before that, Californians had to purchase green coffee beans, <b>and</b> <b>roast</b> and grind them on their own. To help build his mill, Bovee hired James A. Folger as a carpenter. James had arrived from Nantucket Island {{at the age of}} 15 with his two older brothers during the California Gold Rush. In the 1850s, kerosene began to offer a cheaper alternative to whale oil, which had been Nantucket's life-blood, resulting in the re-purposing of many of its ships to bring coffee from South America to San Francisco. After working at Bovee’s mill for nearly a year, James had saved enough money to stake a claim in the company and headed out to mine for gold. He agreed to carry along samples of coffee and spices, taking orders from grocery stores along the way. Upon his return to San Francisco in 1865, James became a full partner of The Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills. In 1872, he bought out the other partners and renamed the company to J.A. Folger & Co.|$|E
500|$|Jemima is a {{domestic}} duck of the Aylesbury breed, whose eggs are routinely confiscated by the farmer's wife because she believes Jemima a poor sitter. Jemima searches {{for a place}} away from the farm where she can hatch her eggs without human interference, and naively confides her woes to a suave fox who invites her to nest in a shed at his home. Jemima accepts his invitation, little realising her danger: the fox plans to kill <b>and</b> <b>roast</b> her. Kep, a collie on the farm, discovers Jemima's whereabouts and rescues her just in time. Potter indicated the tale was a revision of [...] "Little Red Riding Hood" [...] with Jemima, the fox, and the dog parallels to the fairy tale's heroine, wolf, and woodcutter.

The preparatory kykeon or mixed drink of the initiates, prepared from barley and herbs, referred in the Homeric hymn to Demeter, whose name some scholars believe meant [...] "Barley-mother". The practice was to dry the barley groats <b>and</b> <b>roast</b> them before preparing the porridge, according to Pliny the Elder's Natural History (xviii.72).
