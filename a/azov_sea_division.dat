The current status of populations of Euphorbia peplis L. in eastern part of the <b>Azov</b> <b>Sea</b> coast on Chushka and Yasenki Spit wewre presented.

50|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} on June 13, 1922 as Black <b>Sea</b> - <b>Azov</b> <b>Sea</b> Shipping by the Council of Labour and Defence {{as part of}} the People's Commissariat of Communication Routes and administrated by the Central Administration of State Merchant Fleet (Gostorgflot). The company however traces its history to May 16, 1833 when the Black Sea Society of Steamships (ROPiT) was established as means of permanent communications between Odessa and Istanbul, but the company disappeared after the Crimean War of the 1850s. The Black <b>Sea</b> - <b>Azov</b> <b>Sea</b> Shipping company splits into Black <b>Sea</b> Shipping Company, <b>Azov</b> <b>Sea</b> Shipping Company and Georgian Shipping Company after World War II. Another split took place in 1964 when a new company, Novorossiysk Shipping Company, was created from the tanker division of the Black Sea Shipping Company.|$|R

40|$|The {{geological}} {{history of}} the Ponto-Caspian region, with alternating cycles of isolation and reconnection among the three main basins (Black and <b>Azov</b> <b>Seas,</b> and the more distant Caspian Sea) {{as well as between}} them and the Mediterranean Sea, profoundly affected the diversification of its aquatic fauna, leading to a high degree of endemism. Two alternative hypotheses on the origin of this amazing biodiversity have been proposed, corresponding to phases of allopatric separation of aquatic fauna among sea basins: a Late Miocene origin (10 - 6. MYA) vs. a more recent Pleistocene ancestry (< 2. MYA). Both hypotheses support a vicariant origin of (1) Black. +. <b>Azov</b> <b>Sea</b> lineages on the one hand, and (2) Caspian Sea lineages on the other. Here, we present a study on the Ponto-Caspian endemic amphipod Pontogammarus maeoticus. We assessed patterns of divergence based on (a) two mitochondrial and one nuclear gene, and (b) a morphometric analysis of 23 morphological traits in 16 populations from South and West Caspian <b>Sea,</b> South <b>Azov</b> <b>Sea</b> and North-West Black Sea. Genetic data indicate a long and independent evolutionary history, dating back from the late Miocene to early Pleistocene (6. 6 - 1. 6. MYA), for an unexpected, major split between (i) a Black Sea clade and (ii) a well-supported clade grouping individuals from the Caspian and <b>Azov</b> <b>Seas.</b> Absence of shared haplotypes argues against either recent or human-mediated exchanges between Caspian and <b>Azov</b> <b>Seas.</b> A mismatch distribution analysis supports more stable population demography in the Caspian than in the Black Sea populations. Morphological divergence largely followed patterns of genetic divergence: our analyses grouped samples according to the basin of origin and corroborated the close phylogenetic affinity between Caspian and <b>Azov</b> <b>Sea</b> lineages. Altogether, our results highlight the necessity of careful (group-specific) evaluation of evolutionary trajectories in marine taxa that should certainly not be inferred from the current geographical proximity of sea basins alone. © 2013 Elsevier Inc...|$|R

In the ecological and hydrophysical researches we have found abnormally low levels of dissolved oxygen in the bottom layer of the <b>Azov</b> <b>Sea.</b> Among the various approximations of the vertical turbulent exchange coefficient, the algebraic subgrid models are the most applicable. These models are based on the determination of turbulent flows as averaged multiplication of deviations over space or time (correlation) of the velocity components of the currents and a transferring physical quantity. The numerical experiment for determination of vertical turbulent exchange coefficient for some points of the <b>Azov</b> <b>Sea</b> was performed. Direct dependence between values of the vertical turbulent exchange coefficient and the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the bottom layer was obtained...|$|R

Shestakov initiated the establishment of the first naval school in 1868 that opened later during governorship of Johan Hampus Furuhjelm in 1874. He planned to develop coastal trade on <b>Azov</b> <b>Sea,</b> promoting sales of Russian coal for steamers on Black <b>Sea</b> and <b>Azov</b> Sea; he tried to improve navigation on <b>Azov</b> <b>Sea</b> and Don River; introduced a brand new system of lighthouses in the shallow waters near Taganrog and along <b>Azov</b> <b>Sea</b> coast to replace old equipment. In Taganrog he introduced the new system of gas lighting throughout the city, establishing a new gas plant for this purpose. In 1883, considering his achievements, the citizens of Taganrog made Ivan Shestakov an honored citizen of Taganrog.|$|R
