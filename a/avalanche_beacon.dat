50|$|The {{original}} <b>avalanche</b> <b>beacon</b> was {{an analog}} beacon which transmitted the pulsed signal as an audible tone to the user. The tone gets louder when the user {{is closer to}} the transmitting beacon. These beacons have also been augmented with LEDs that provide a visual indication of signal strength, and earpieces to increase the ability of the listener to hear the tone.|$|E
50|$|The {{returned}} {{signal is}} translated into an audio tone whose volume {{is proportional to}} the returned signal, and by means of a volume control a trained rescue operator can literally go straight to the buried reflector once a signal is detected. Recco's newest detector - 9th generation released in 2009 - also includes an <b>avalanche</b> rescue <b>beacon</b> receiver. The R9 detector allows a single rescuer to perform both the search for Recco reflectors and 457 kHz <b>avalanche</b> <b>beacons</b> at the same time.|$|R
50|$|Backcountry {{avalanches}} {{are generally}} {{triggered by the}} immediate action of the party.

50|$|In this Leg's Detour, teams chose {{between two}} {{mountain}} rescue tasks: Search and Rescue. In Search, teams used {{a set of}} <b>avalanche</b> <b>beacons</b> to search the Matterhorn for a dummy buried in the snow; they then had to dig out the whole dummy before they could receive their next clue. In Rescue, teams used a special hoisting device to rescue a mountaineer trapped in a crevasse. One team member had to lower his or her teammate into the crevasse; the lowered teammate then had to attach a carabiner to the mountaineer. The teammate at the top then had to raise the pair back to the surface; once at the top, the rescued mountaineer would give them their next clue.|$|R
5000|$|Avalanche {{transceivers}} or <b>avalanche</b> <b>beacons</b> are a {{class of}} active radio beacon transceivers operating at 457 kHz and specialized {{for the purpose of}} finding people or equipment buried under snow. When the owner sets out on a skiing descent, the transceiver is activated, causing the device to emit a low-power pulsed beacon signal during the trip. [...] Following an avalanche, and if the holder of the transceiver is safe and has not themselves been caught by the avalanche, they may switch the transceiver from transmit into receive mode, allowing use as a radio direction finding device to search for signals coming from other skiers' transmitter beacons who may be trapped. A 457 kHz beacon is an active device that requires batteries. A ski suit may also contain a passive RECCO transponder sewn into the clothing.|$|R
5000|$|On March 7, 2017 Steve Leavitt from The Dalles, Oregon {{went missing}} around 11:20 a.m. when he rode up the Heather chair. On March 15 Searchers found {{his body in}} a tree well {{at the bottom of}} an area called Jack's woods. A {{recovery}} team got his body off the mountain Thursday morning.  Leavitt was wearing a helmet but not an <b>avalanche</b> <b>beacon</b> or backpack with overnight supplies. He's one of 17 skiers, snowboarders or patrollers who have died at Mt. Hood Meadows.|$|E
50|$|The Recco {{system is}} used by {{organised}} rescue services around the world. The Recco system is a two-part system where the rescue team uses a small hand-held detector. The detector receives a directional signal that is reflected back from a small, passive, transponder called a reflector that is included into outerwear, boots, helmets, and body protection. Recco reflectors are {{not a substitute for}} avalanche beacons. The Recco signal does not interfere with beacons. In fact, the current Recco detector also has an <b>avalanche</b> <b>beacon</b> receiver (457 kHz) so one rescuer can search for a Recco signal and a beacon signal at the same time.|$|E
50|$|The search {{with the}} Recco {{detector}} {{is very similar}} to how an avalanche rescue beacon search is performed. The avalanche debris area is searched in 20m wide corridors. The detector can be used by a rescuer on foot, skis, or from a helicopter who aims the detector toward the snow. Once a signal is heard the operator orients the detector to the strongest signal and follows the tone—along a straight line. When the tone disappears the rescuer is right above the victim. The detector is then aimed downwards at the snow and several rapid crisscross sweeps are done to pinpoint the signal. Unlike an <b>avalanche</b> <b>beacon</b> the Recco detector is truly directional and accurately pinpoints the location. A probe pole is recommended to determine the burial depth.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} of new <b>avalanche</b> <b>beacons</b> {{in the last years}} was the motive to initiate a test of electronic transceivers by the Austrian Institute for Avalanche Research. The project was carried out in 2001 in cooperation with the Austrian Consumer's Association (VKI) and the Austrian Institute for Home and Leisuretime Safety. Seven different types of beacons were tested under comparable conditions in the laboratory {{as well as in the}} field. Goal of the project was to provide relevant information for backcountry skiers, off-piste skiers and snowboarders; moreover a folder was printed to help people when buying a new transceiver. The investigations in the lab were concentrated not only on technical measurements (including measurements on the energy consumption of the different transceivers) but also on practical tests (e. g. how is the battery capacity indicated, how can the beacons be used with gloves…). For the field work a standardized test was developed, which had to be comprehensible and objective on the one hand, and as efficient as possible on the other hand. The search tests were carried out with three different groups of individuals (1. skiers without knowledge on <b>avalanche</b> <b>beacons,</b> 2. backcountry skiers with a basic knowledge and 3. professionals). In total about 130 persons took part in the search tests. The participants were also asked to fill out a questionnaire. So it was possible to get additional information on operation instructions and handling of the transceivers. The results were described with marks ranging from 1 (very good) to 5 (not sufficient). All beacons passed the tests. However, only one beacon got a ” 1 ” in the technical as well as in the practical test, two beacons got a “ 1 ” in the technical test and a “ 2 ” in the practical test; the marks of the other transceivers were between “ 2 ” und “ 3 ”...|$|R

40|$|Avalanches {{are one of}} {{the major}} threats to life in high {{mountain}} terrain. Once buried by an avalanche, survival chances dramatically drop from 92 % after 15 minutes to only 30 % after 35 minutes mostly {{due to the lack of}} oxygen. It is therefore extremely important to rescue any victims as fast as possible in order to maximize survival chances. Today 's technology, so called electronic <b>avalanche</b> <b>beacons,</b> only allow to localize buried victims. In this paper we propose a novel avalanche rescue system enhanced with wearable sensors. Those sensors provide information about the vital state of buried victims such as heart rate, respiration activity, and blood oxygen saturation, as well as the orientation of the victim. We believe that this knowledge can empower non-professional companion rescuers with a tool to perform triage, i. e. sorting victims into categories of priority for treatment. Better allocation of resources can help to maximize survival chances of avalanche victims...|$|R
5000|$|Residents of Bozeman are {{alerted to}} the arrival of fresh snow by a {{flashing}} blue beacon placed atop the Baxter Hotel in downtown Bozeman. First installed in 1988, it is activated every time Bridger Bowl accumulates two inches of fresh snow, and remains on for 24 hours. Maintenance of the light is a priority, and only once in 20 years was it out of operation for two days.Bridger Bowl opened the new Schlasman's chairlift for the 2008/2009 season, the first lift-served terrain expansion in 30 years. Schlasman's is a reconditioned 1976 Doppelmayr double chair lift, formerly known as the [...] "Peruvian" [...] lift, purchased from Snowbird ski resort in Utah. This new lift (named after a miner who died in an avalanche in 1885) has a vertical rise of 1700 ft and adds 311 acre of new lift-served terrain for expert skiers only. To ride this lift, skiers are required to carry an avalanche transceiver; partners and shovels are highly recommended. For the 2013/2014 season, Bridger Bowl unveiled its new Powder Park and Alpine chair lifts. These brand-new lifts tripled the uphill capacity (3,300/people/hr vs. 1,100/people/hr) compared to the [...] "old Alpine" [...] center pole, double chair that was retired {{at the end of the}} 2012/2013 season.Bridger Bowl is noted for its expert-only skiing terrain known as [...] "The Ridge". There are six sections of the ridge known as Schlasman's, D Route, C Route, B Route, A route and Northwest/Hidden Gully Areas.

40|$|Abstract: The {{performance}} of {{four types of}} <b>avalanche</b> rescue <b>beacons</b> was tested during the winter 2001 in Switzerland. During the first field test the search times were compared. The second test focused on range measurements to determine search strip width. Results show that maximal range of different beacons varies between about 25 and 100 m. Differences in search times are as well significant, but relatively small compared with the total time for recovery of a buried victim. A recently proposed method to determine search strip width based on maximum range measurements in coaxial antenna orientation was verified and can be recommended...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: When using {{transceivers}} (or <b>avalanche</b> <b>beacons)</b> {{to search}} for fully buried avalanche victims, the search strategy depends on the signal search strip width which influences the search time until the first signal from the buried subjects can be received by the rescuer. It depends on technical characteristics of the avalanche rescue devices, the avalanche scenario {{as well as the}} rescuer’s behaviour. The larger the signal search strip width, the shorter is the search time and therefore the higher the survival chance of the buried subject. However, if the search strip width is chosen too large, the probability to miss a buried subject increases, which makes time-consuming multiple searches necessary – and decreases survival chances. Therefore, the search strip width needs to optimized. Only a few years ago, with the advent of digital transceivers, it was realized that the search strip width is not a universal constant but is a device specific property depending primarily on the range of the transceiver. Several approaches on how to determine the signal search strip width have been presented in the past. Most of them use rather conservative assumptions for the different input variables. A newly developed simulation approach for the optimization of the search strip width allows considering more realistic (rather than worst case) assumptions. Preliminary results suggest that the optimal signal search strip width is higher than previously assumed. In future applications, the simulation may be used to optimize a broad variety of search parameters or even entire search systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A person {{buried by}} a snow {{avalanche}} {{can be found}} by measuring the magnetic field generated by an <b>avalanche</b> <b>beacon</b> or ARVA carried by the victim. However, the signals received are difficult to interpret and require people with good training on the actual searching techniques. In this paper we show that the search can be automated using SLAM techniques. The rescuer is equipped with an inertial sensor to estimate its own motion and a triple antenna to obtain 3 D measurements of the magnetic field generated by the victim’s ARVA. Both measurements are used to build a ”robocentric ” map that contains {{the location of the}} victim relative to the rescuer. To solve this highly non-linear SLAM problem we propose and compare two alternative solutions based on a sum of Gaussinas (SOGs) filter and a Particle filter.

40|$|Abstract — The {{probability}} of finding alive a person buried by a snow avalanche decreases dramatically with time. The {{best chance for}} the victims is to carry an <b>avalanche</b> <b>beacon</b> or ARVA (from the french: Appareil de Recherche de Victimes d’Avalanche), that transmits a magnetic field that can be detected by the rescuer’s ARVA. However, the signals received are difficult to interpret and require people with good training on the actual searching techniques. In this paper we propose to address the search for victims as a SLAM problem: tracking the rescuer location while building {{a map of the}} locations of the victims under the snow, using 3 D measurements of the magnetic field produced by their ARVAs. Given the high non-linearity of the problem, we propose a technique based on sum of Gaussians (SOGs) and Extended Kalman Filter. We present preliminary simulation results showing that this technique is faster and more accurate than the classical ones. I...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The time {{required}} to search a buried person using an <b>avalanche</b> <b>beacon</b> contributes significantly to the overall rescue time. This paper investigates the technical requirements and psychological demands with respect to minimal search time. The earlier ones define a beacon's technical specification, the latter ones {{the design of the}} user interface. The first search phase is mainly characterized by the search strip width defined by receiver sensitivity. Even the {{time required}} to get the beacon ready to receive is subject to optimization. Once the first signal is detected, confusion caused by multiple transmitters costs valuable time. Hence a reliable and user-friendly multi-burial detection and signal isolation is crucial. Pin-pointing finally imposes the highest mental workload on the searcher. An intuitive user interface freeing the searcher from the need to compare numbers promises the largest gain here. For multi-burial accidents the influence of these beacon characteristics on search success and search time is discussed. This analysis includes numerical simulation of multi-burial search as well as a qualitative discussion of user interface requirements based on the accident reports and statements of the persons involved. The results may serve {{as a starting point for}} the development of a more generalized framework...|$|E

Both Detour options required teams to drive themselves to The Lodge of The Ten Peaks in Lake Louise and pick up skiing equipment before taking the ski lift up the mountain. In Search, teams had to use an <b>avalanche</b> rescue <b>beacon</b> to search a marked area for a transmitter buried beneath the snow. Once teams dig up this transmitter, they could exchange it for their next clue. In Ski, both team members {{had to go through}} a slalom skiing course, passing through all the flags, in order to receive their next clue.|$|R
50|$|Avalanche: The players met up for {{the first}} time on a snowy mountaintop in Queenstown, New Zealand. They were split into three groups of four and were given thirty minutes to find three <b>avalanche</b> <b>beacons</b> that had been hidden in the snow, to the north, east, and west of their {{starting}} position. Each group was given shovels and a receiver that would beep if it was within 40 meters of the beacon. The groups sent to the north and to the east found what they were looking for quickly - the group sent to the north found the beacon itself, while the group sent to the east found a locked black case. Upon returning to the starting position, they found that the north groups beacon had a dogtag on it that revealed the combination to one of the locks. Kristy, Heidi, Sonya, and John, sent to the west, initially went in the wrong direction and returned with their beacon with mere seconds on the clock. The group unlocked the black case in time, but what they found inside it was a second locked case. The host revealed that he had the key to that case, and to obtain it, nine of the players would have to spend the night in a snow cave. The three who were spared were Liz, Heidi, and Kristy. The other nine were told that if anyone asked to leave the snow cave, they could, but the money for the challenge would then be lost. All nine of them stayed the night in the snow cave, and the $25,000 was won.|$|R
