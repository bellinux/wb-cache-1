50|$|There are {{two modes}} for the {{operation}} of NSOM technique, with and without an aperture. These two mode have also been combined with the near-field Raman spectroscopy. The near-field aperture must be nanosized that complicates the probe manufacturing process. Also, the aperture method usually has a very weak signal due to weak excitation and Raman scattering signal. Overall, these factors lower the signal-to-noise ratio in <b>aperature</b> based NSOM/Raman technique. Apertureless probes {{are based on a}} metal-coated tip and provide a stronger signal.|$|E

After a multi-year upgrade completed on July 29, 2015, the usable optical <b>aperature</b> was increased to 10m. [...] The mirror itself is composed of 91 hexagonal segments, a segmented mirror design like the Keck telescopes. Updates to the telescope have increased its field of view from 4 arcminutes to 22 arcminutes) (a full moon is 30 arcminutes for comparison). The telescope mirrors are aligned within a fraction of a wavelength of visible light by actuators under each segment. The tower next to the telescope, called the Center of Curvature Alignment Sensor Tower (CCAS), is used to calibrate the mirror segments. One of the advantages of this telescope design is that it was over 5 times more cost efficient for its aperture size than a more traditional design.|$|E

The first ring ramps at 400 Hz and accelerates muons from 30 to 400 GeV in 28 orbits using 14 GV of 1. 3 GHz superconducting RF. The ring duplicates the Fermilab 400 GeV main ring FODO lattice, {{which had a}} 61 m cell length. Muon survival is 80 %. The second ring accelerates muons from 400 to 750 GeV in 44 orbits using 8 GV of 1. 3 GHz superconducting RF. The 30 T/m main ring quadrupoles are lengthened 87 % to 3. 3 m. The four main ring dipoles in each half cell are replaced by three dipoles which ramp at 550 Hz from - 1. 8 T to + 1. 8 T interleaved with two 8 T fixed superconducting dipoles. The ramping and superconducting dipoles oppose each other at 400 GeV and act in unison at 750 GeV. Muon survival is 92 %. Two mm copper wire, 0. 28 mm grain oriented silicon steel laminations, and a low duty cycle mitigate eddy current losses.

40|$|Analyzing {{stability}} of particle motion in storage rings {{contributes to the}} general field of stability analysis in weakly nonlinear motion. A method which we call pseudo invariant estimation (PIE) is used to compute lower bounds on the survival time in circular accelerators. The pseudeo invariants needed for this approach are computed via nonlinear perturbative normal form theory and the required global maxima of the highly complicated multivariate functions could only be rigorously bound with an extension of interval arithmetic. The bounds on the survival times are large enough to the relevant; {{the same is true}} for the lower bounds on dynamical <b>aperatures,</b> which can be computed. The PIE method can lead to novel design criteria with the objective of maximizing the survival time. A major effort in the direction of rigourous predictions only makes sense if accurate models of accelerators are available. Fringe fields often have a significant influence on optical properties, but the computation of fringe-field maps by DA based integration is slower by several orders of magnitude than DA evaluation of the propagator for main-field maps. A novel computation of fringe-field effects called symplectic scaling (SYSCA) is introduced. It exploits the advantages of Lie transformations, generating functions, and scaling properties and is extremely accurate. The computation of fringe-field maps is typically made nearly two orders of magnitude faster. (orig.)
