Observations {{suggest that it}} is always killed by fire in the north of its range, which is relatively hot and dry, and where individual plants are usually smaller, but may survive fire in the cooler, moister, south. Moreover, it is essentially non-serotinous in the south, since all seed is released {{by the end of the}} second year, but seed retention increases steadily to the north, and at the northern end of its range, it typically takes <b>around</b> <b>four</b> years for a plant to release half of its seed in the absence of bushfire, with some seed retained for up to 12 years.|$|E

The area of convection, or thunderstorms, spread across Central America. A surface circulation developed offshore El Salvador, and the system formed into a tropical depression on June 14. For much of the summer of 1971, a large pool of anomalously warm water temperatures extended from Central America to the Gulf of California off the Mexican coast, reaching 89.6 °F (32 °C). This allowed for steady intensification as it tracked through the Gulf of Tehuantepec.|$|E
