2500|$|A {{few months}} later, using a draft {{copy of the}} Aeronautical Board's study, Chief of the Air Corps Maj. Gen. Oscar Westover {{calculated}} the transport requirements for mobilization {{and found that the}} Air Corps lacked at least 200 transports needed for the first 120 days, and that the airlines only had sufficient aircraft to fill a third of that shortfall. The Aeronautical Board issued its report in February 1937 and specifically counseled against a military takeover of the airlines, instead recommending that a civilian [...] "Federal Coordinator" [...] be designated to control and coordinate their operations to eliminate duplication of effort. <b>Airline</b> <b>personnel</b> should likewise be deferred from military service to perform the tasks asked of the carriers.|$|E
2500|$|The airport had a manager, an assistant, a radio telegraphist {{and ground}} {{handling}} crew. Operation {{of the airport}} {{was carried out by}} the airline, which received a subsidy of NOK1,400 from Trondheim Municipality. This included NOK300 in rent. DNL chose Det Nordenfjeldske Dampskipsselskap (NFDS) as their handling agent in town, a shipping company which was also a minority owner of DNL. NFDS offered an airport bus service from their offices in town 35minutes before departure and 30minutes before from Britannia Hotel. Passengers were offered breakfast at the hotel. NFDS subcontracted the airport bus to Styrkaar Melbye, who held the concession to operate a scheduled service to Jonsvatnet.

As a result, {{in addition to his}} musical career, Dave Carroll regularly gives speeches about customer service.|$|R
2500|$|Pilots and <b>airline</b> <b>personnel</b> {{throughout}} the industry petitioned the NTSB to revise its report. First Officer Claude Ouimet sent the NTSB a detailed defence of the crew's actions, including {{the decision to}} land in Cincinnati instead of Standiford Field Airport in Louisville, Kentucky, the airport closest to where the crew first notified Air Traffic Control in Indianapolis, Indiana, {{that they needed to}} make an emergency landing. Ouimet stated that Louisville was too close to be able to descend from cruising altitude to an emergency landing safely, and even landing in Cincinnati was a questionable proposition given Cameron's difficulties in controlling the plane. After reviewing Ouimet's missive and re-evaluating the available data, the NTSB issued a revised version of the report which included Ouimet's explanation of the landing decision, though the report was still critical of Cameron's decision not to inquire about the fire itself. [...] "All I know was that I did the best I could," [...] Cameron later said. [...] "I'm very sorry the people that didn't get off, didn't get off, because {{we spent a lot of}} time and effort getting them there." ...|$|E

The aircraft arrived at its fourth stop, Louisville, at 9:42 pm. After refueling, the flight received clearance to depart at 9:54 pm.

50|$|The FAA {{does not}} require {{commercial}} pilots to train to ditch but <b>airline</b> cabin <b>personnel</b> must train on the evacuation process.

40|$|In September 2003, America West Airlines {{implemented}} a new aircraft boarding strategy {{that reduces the}} air-line’s average passenger boarding time by over two minutes, or approximately 20 percent, for full and nearly full flights. The strategy, developed {{by a team of}} Arizona State University and America West <b>Airline’s</b> <b>personnel,</b> is a hybrid between traditional back-to-front boarding and outside-inside boarding used by other airlines. Field observations, numerical results of analytical models, and simulation studies provided information that resulted in an improved aircraft-boarding strategy termed reverse pyramid. With the new boarding strategy, passengers still have personal seat assignments, but rather than boarding by rows from the back {{to the front of the}} airplane, they board in groups minimizing expected passenger interference in the airplane. The analytical, simulation, and implementation results obtained show that the method represents a significant improvement in terms of boarding time over traditional pure back-to-front, outside-inside boarding strategies...|$|R
