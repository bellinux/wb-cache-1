25|$|In the {{digestive}} system, the anterior {{region of the}} foregut has been modified to form a pharyngial sucking pump as they need it for the food they eat, which {{are for the most}} part liquids. An esophagus follows and leads to the posterior of the pharynx and in some species forms a form of crop. The midgut is short and straight, with the hindgut being longer and coiled. Ancestors of lepidopteran species, stemming from Hymenoptera, had midgut ceca, although this is lost in current butterflies and moths. Instead, all {{the digestive}} enzymes other than initial digestion, are immobilized at the surface of the midgut cells. In larvae, long-necked <b>and</b> <b>stalked</b> goblet cells are found in the anterior and posterior midgut regions, respectively. In insects, the goblet cells excrete positive potassium ions, which are absorbed from leaves ingested by the larvae. Most butterflies and moths display the usual digestive cycle, however species that have a different diet require adaptations to meet these new demands.|$|E
25|$|Lynsey damages her {{friendship}} with Mercedes when she begins {{a relationship with}} Riley, which ends because of his feelings for Mitzeee. The latter accuses Lynsey of being a stalker which results in Mercedes being stabbed during a confrontation with Mitzeee. She realises that Mercedes stabbed herself <b>and</b> <b>stalked</b> Mitzeee because of her involvement with Riley. Lynsey is also threatened by Walker and Ally after she becomes suspicious about their shared past. Brendan finds her dead and a murder investigation is launched with Mercedes, Ally and Walker amongst the suspects. Jacqui exposes Doctor Browning as the perpetrator - during flashbacks he kills Lynsey because she discovered Mercedes' vendetta against Mitzeee. Walker is present at the murder and does not prevent {{it in order to}} conceal an undercover police operation that she discovers. Lynsey appears as an apparition in Silas' mind and following her funeral, Doctor Browning pleading not guilty to charges of murder. At Christmas, Doctor Browning turns up at Mercede's door and explains that he was cleared of murdering Lynsey after blaming Riley Costello (Rob Norbury).|$|E

40|$|Sprouting {{angiogenesis}} is {{a dynamic}} process in which endothelial cells collectively migrate, shape new lumenized tubes, make new connections, and remodel the nascent network into a hierarchically branched and functionally perfused vascular bed. Endothelial cells in the nascent sprout adopt two distinct cellular phenotypes-known as tip <b>and</b> <b>stalk</b> cells-with specialized functions and gene expression patterns. VEGF and Notch signaling engage in an intricate cross talk to balance tip <b>and</b> <b>stalk</b> cell formation <b>and</b> to regulate directed tip cell migration <b>and</b> <b>stalk</b> cell proliferation. In this article, we summarize the current knowledge and implications of the tip/stalk cell concepts and the quantitative and dynamic integration of VEGF and Notch signaling in tip <b>and</b> <b>stalk</b> cell selection. status: publishe...|$|R

500|$|In 1975, an {{apparently}} very similar species was described from the Lower Cambrian (515 to 520 million years ago) Maotianshan Shale [...] of Chengjiang, China. It was originally placed within the [...] "ostracod"-like genus Mononotella, as Mononotella ovata. In 1991, Xian-Guang Hou and Jan Bergström reclassified {{it under the}} new genus Chuandianella when additional discoveries of more complete specimens made its resemblance to W. fieldensis more apparent. Like W. fieldensis, Chuandianella ovata had a bivalved carapace with a median ridge, a pair of caudal rami, {{a single pair of}} antennae, <b>and</b> <b>stalked</b> eyes. In 2004, Jun-Yuan Chen tentatively transferred it to the genus Waptia. However, C. ovata had eight abdominal somites in contrast to five in W. fieldensis. Its limbs were biramous and were undifferentiated, unlike those of W. fieldensis. Other authors deemed these differences to be enough to separate it from Waptia to its own genus.|$|E
