500|$|Sitting on {{the bench}} as the game entered the final minute of play, Henderson [...] "had a feeling" [...] that he could score. [...] He {{convinced}} coach Sinden to send him out when Peter Mahovlich left the ice. Rushing into the Soviet zone, Henderson missed a pass from Yvan Cournoyer {{in front of the}} net and was tripped by a Soviet defenceman. [...] As he got to his feet, Phil Esposito recovered the puck and sent it towards Henderson in front of the net. The first shot was stopped by Vladislav Tretiak, but Henderson recovered the rebound <b>and</b> <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> past the fallen goaltender to give Canada a 6–5 lead with only 34 seconds left to play. [...] It was his seventh goal of the tournament, tying him for the series lead with Esposito and Alexander Yakushev. The goal won the game, and the series, for Canada. [...] The team returned home to massive crowds in Montreal and Toronto, and Paul Henderson had become a national hero.|$|E
6000|$|MacDonald counted {{his cards}} carefully, to make double {{sure it was}} not a foul hand, wrote a sum on a paper slip, <b>and</b> <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> into the pot, with the simple utterance:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And here's a {{piece of}} cake," [...] added Jack, <b>and</b> <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> along, under {{the edge of the}} table. Then Pepper got up and left the room. He did not know where to go and so walked slowly in the {{direction}} of the boathouse.|$|E
60|$|Billy {{caught it}} as deftly {{as a dog}} catches a bit of biscuit, looked at it in great surprise, tossed it in the air, bit its rim critically, <b>and</b> finally <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> into his {{trousers}} pocket.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you doubt}} me," [...] Ronald said, [...] "you {{can send a}} man to the wall. I felt my feet loosen a tile <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> down into the gutter." ...|$|R
60|$|The opening {{was almost}} square, with three sides of rough rock. In trying {{to climb up}} some of the rocks Tom gave one a shove <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> from sight, {{revealing}} an opening beyond.|$|R
60|$|His hand {{accepted}} the moist tender gland <b>and</b> <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> into a sidepocket. Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers' pocket and laid {{them on the}} rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid, disc by disc, into the till.|$|E
60|$|When Jonas {{was sure}} that he was in, he took the old fender <b>and</b> <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> down very {{cautiously}} between the trap and the box, so as to cover the open part entirely, and make a sort of grated front, like a cage. Then he took the trap away, and there the little nut-cracker was, safely imprisoned, but yet fairly exposed to view.|$|E
6000|$|... "A sad spectacle," [...] {{said the}} Negro President, and he sighed as he spoke. [...] "One wonders if our civilisation, if our moral {{standards}} themselves, are slipping from us." [...] Then half in reverie, {{or as if}} overcome by the melancholy of his own thought, he lifted a spoon from the table <b>and</b> <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> gently into the bosom of his faded uniform.|$|E
60|$|Very {{slowly the}} wing of his {{antagonist}} seemed to broaden as the impetus of his blow turned it up. He saw the full breadth of <b>it</b> <b>and</b> then <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> downward out of his sight.|$|R
50|$|However, the {{economic}} downturn hit the company hard, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> into losses in 2007, and did not recover. On 21 January 2009, after the company was placed into administration. The companies assets were disposed of by the administrators over the next thirteen months.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the tip of}} the rod {{broke off}} short just even with the splints <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> down the line out of sight. Dan lowered the rod so most of the strain would come on the reel, and now he held like grim death.|$|R
60|$|Joel {{ran down}} to his skiff and, leaping in, began to row vigorously across. Bostil watched while the workmen turned the boat over <b>and</b> <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> off the sand-bar and tied it {{securely}} to the mooring. Bostil observed that not a man there saw anything unusual about the river. But, for that matter, {{there was nothing to}} see. The river was the same.|$|E
60|$|Next {{day they}} did {{not go back to}} the fence, but worked at the gateway on the blind corrals. Pan {{constructed}} the opening to resemble a narrow aisle of scrub oak. Material for this they cut from the bluff <b>and</b> <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> down to the level. By sunset one corral had been almost completed. It was large enough to hold a thousand horses. One third of it was fenced by the bluff.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] {{said the}} girl, and Penelope began hastily {{to amend the}} disarray of her hair, which she tumbled into a mass {{on the top of}} her little head, setting off the pale dark of her {{complexion}} with a flash of crimson ribbon at her throat. She moved across the carpet once or twice with the quaint grace that belonged to her small figure, made a dissatisfied grimace at it in the glass, caught a handkerchief out of a drawer <b>and</b> <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> into her pocket, and then descended to Corey.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a pause}} of five full {{minutes after}} this, and the blue-green flame died down. Janoo stooped to settle one of her anklets, while Azizun turned {{her face to the}} wall and took the terrier in her arms. Suddhoo put out an arm {{mechanically}} to Janoo's huqa, <b>and</b> she <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> across the floor with her foot. Directly above the body and on the wall, were a couple of flaming portraits, in stamped paper frames, of the Queen and the Prince of Wales. They looked down on the performance, and, to my thinking, seemed to heighten the grotesqueness of it all.|$|R
60|$|Back <b>and</b> back <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> for {{ten feet}} {{until it had}} {{disclosed}} at its right a narrow doorway leading into a dark and narrow corridor that paralleled the outer wall. Scarcely was the entrance uncovered than Woola and I had leaped through--then the door slipped quietly back into place.|$|R
60|$|The dog {{was delighted}} at the sudden {{excitement}} {{caused by the}} cat, and ran barking and dancing along the bank, so that he presently knocked against the dish, <b>and</b> behold! <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> down the bank, carrying the spoon with it, and fell with a splash into {{the water of the}} brook.|$|R
60|$|As Rollo was {{speaking}} these words, {{in order to}} show Jonas more exactly how he meant to perform the operation, he took hold of the flower-pot with both his hands, <b>and</b> <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> suddenly off of the seat. Now it happened that the poor bees that were inside, chilled with the dampness and cold, were nearly all crawling about upon the seat; and when Rollo suddenly moved the flower-pot along, forgetting for a moment what there was inside, the rough edges of the flower-pot bruised and ground them to death, and they dropped down upon the walk, some dead, some buzzing a little, and one trying to crawl.|$|E
6000|$|... "Give her something," [...] {{he whispered}} in panic. I was afraid. Then {{suddenly}} getting a florin from my pocket, I stiffened my nerves <b>and</b> <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> into her palm. Her hand was soft, and warm, and curled in sleep. She started violently, {{looking up at}} me, then down at her hand. I turned my face aside, terrified lest she should look in my eyes, and full of shame and grief I ran down the embankment to him. We hurried along under the plane trees in silence. The shining cars were drawing tall in the distance over Westminster Bridge, a fainter, yellow light running {{with them on the}} water below. The wet streets were spilled with golden liquor of light, and on the deep blackness of the river were the restless yellow slashes of the lamps.|$|E
6000|$|Delivering this {{tremendous}} comparison as an unanswerable climax, Rand applied himself {{once more to}} his repast. Ruth, after a moment's pause, without speaking or looking up, disengaged his hand from under his chin, <b>and</b> <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> along, palm uppermost, {{on the table beside}} his brother. Thereupon Rand slowly reached forward his left hand, the right being engaged in conveying victual to his mouth, and laid it on his brother's palm. The act was evidently an habitual, half mechanical one; for in a few moments the hands were as gently disengaged, without comment or expression. At last Rand leaned back in his chair, laid down his knife and fork, and, complacently loosening the belt that held his revolver, threw it and the weapon on his bed. Taking out his pipe, and chipping some tobacco on the table, he said carelessly, [...] "I came a piece through the woods with Mornie just now." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{visitors}} got {{on board}} their canoe, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> {{off into the}} mist. When the splash of paddles died away, an oppressive silence settled down on the vessel, and the darkness seemed very thick, for the big cargo-lamp had been put out. After the keen activity a reaction had set in: the men were tired and felt the heat.|$|R
6000|$|In a panic the {{professor}} slid {{back into the}} window. As his heels disappeared through it, Carl dashed by the window, running sidewise along the ledge. While {{the professor}} was cautiously risking {{his head in the}} night air outside the window again, gazing to the left, where, he had reason to suppose, Carl would have the decency to remain, Carl was rapidly worming to the right. He reached the corner of the building, felt for the tin water-pipe, <b>and</b> <b>slid</b> down <b>it,</b> with his coat-tail protecting his hands. Half-way down, the cloth slipped and his hand was burnt against the corrugated tin. [...] "Consid'able slide," [...] he murmured as he struck the ground and blew softly on his raw palm.|$|R
60|$|After {{this she}} seemed to hear Ishmael talking to her, arguing, explaining, but she made no answer to his words. Her mind was a blank, and all she knew {{was that they were}} riding on for hours. Her tired horse {{stumbled}} up a pass and down its further side. Then she heard dogs bark and saw lights. The horse stopped <b>and</b> she <b>slid</b> from <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> as she was too exhausted to walk, was supported or carried into a hut, as she thought by women who seemed very much afraid of touching her, after which {{she seemed to}} sink into blackness.|$|R
60|$|Dorothy {{decided she}} {{must go to}} him; so she made a dash forward, during a lull in the storm, to where a big square chicken-coop had been lashed to the deck with ropes. She reached this place in safety, but no sooner had she seized fast hold of the slats of the big box in which the {{chickens}} were kept than the wind, as if enraged because the little girl dared to resist its power, suddenly redoubled its fury. With a scream like that of an angry giant it tore away the ropes that held the coop and lifted it high into the air, with Dorothy still clinging to the slats. Around and over it whirled, this way and that, and {{a few moments later}} the chicken-coop dropped far away into the sea, where the big waves caught it <b>and</b> <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> up-hill to a foaming crest and then down-hill into a deep valley, as if it were nothing more than a plaything to keep them amused.|$|E
60|$|Beaton lit {{his pipe}} {{when he found}} himself in his room, and sat down before the dull fire in his grate to think. It struck him there was a dull fire in his heart a great deal like it; and he worked out a fanciful analogy with the coals, still alive, and the ashes {{creeping}} over them, and the dead clay and cinders. He felt sick of himself, sick of his life and of all his works. He was angry with Fulkerson for having got him into that art department of his, for having bought him up; and he was bitter at fate because he had been obliged to use the money to pay some pressing debts, and {{had not been able to}} return the check his father had sent him. He pitied his poor old father; he ached with compassion for him; and he set his teeth and snarled with contempt through them for his own baseness. This was the kind of world it was; but he washed his hands of it. The fault was in human nature, and he reflected with pride that he had at least not invented human nature; he had not sunk so low as that yet. The notion amused him; he thought he might get a Satanic epigram out of it some way. But in the mean time that girl, that wild animal, she kept visibly, tangibly before him; if he put out his hand he might touch hers, he might pass his arm round her waist. In Paris, in a set he knew there, what an effect she would be with that look of hers, and that beauty, all out of drawing! They would recognize the flame quality in her. He imagined a joke about her being a fiery spirit, or nymph, naiad, whatever, from one of her native gas-wells. He began to sketch on a bit of paper from the table at his elbow vague lines that veiled and revealed a level, dismal landscape, and a vast flame against an empty sky, and a shape out of the flame that took on a likeness and floated detached from it. The sketch ran up the left side of the sheet and stretched across it. Beaton laughed out. Pretty good to let Fulkerson have that for the cover of his first number! In black and red it would be effective; it would catch the eye from the news-stands. He made a motion to throw it on the fire, but held it back <b>and</b> <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> into the table-drawer, and smoked on. He saw the dummy with the other sketch in the open drawer which he had brought away from Fulkerson's in the morning and slipped in there, and he took it out and looked at it. He made some criticisms in line with his pencil on it, correcting the drawing here and there, and then he respected it a little more, though he still smiled at the feminine quality--a young lady quality.|$|E
5000|$|Maye {{testified that}} it was dark in his {{apartment}} when he heard someone breaking into the back door, which was located in the bedroom. [...] "That's when I fired the shots," [...] Maye said. [...] "After I fired the shots, I heard them yell 'police! police!' Once I heard them, I put the weapon down <b>and</b> <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> away. I did not know they were police officers." ...|$|E
40|$|Professor Hart, and Hart {{had often}} said [...] {{to others and}} to himself [...] that he was honored to help Dave secure his well-earned dream. Well before the defense, Striver gave Hart a {{penultimate}} copy of his thesis. Hart read it and told Dave that it was absolutely first-rate, {{and that he would}} gladly sign it at the defense. They even shook hands in Hart's book-lined office. Dave noticed that Hart's eyes were bright and trustful, and his bearing paternal. At the defense, Dave thought that he eloquently summarized Chapter 3 of his dissertation. There were two quest 2 ons, one from Professor Rodman and one from Dr. Teer; Dave answered both, apparently to everyone's satisfaction. There were no further objections. Professor Rodman signed. He slid the tome to Teer; she too signed, <b>and</b> then <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> in front of Hart. Hart didn't move. "Ed?" Rodman said. Hart still sat motionless. Dave felt slightly dizzy. "Edward, are you going to sign?" Later, Hart sat alone in his office, in his big leathe...|$|R
500|$|The western dam caused {{much more}} trouble, since it rested on mud that varied in depth to upwards of [...] The {{ends of the}} dam were formed by tipping earth from wagons run out from the {{mainland}} and the island. In the centre, the earth sank into the deep mud <b>and</b> <b>slid</b> away with <b>it.</b> A viaduct of timber piles was built across the gap, to carry loaded trucks from which the earth was thrown out. As the ends approached each other, the tide current was too fast. The contractor twice tried {{to close the gap}} with earth at low-water neap tide, but each time the water broke through to make a gap [...] wide through which the tide poured at [...]|$|R
60|$|Frank drew a pace or two {{nearer the}} edge of the cañon, and felt a creepy shiver run through him as he looked down. The rock he stood upon arched out a little over the shadowy hollow, through the bottom of which the wild waters seethed and clamored. He {{supposed}} that he stood at least sixty feet above them. The rock on the opposite side also projected, so that the rift was wider at the bottom than at the top. In one place, however, the crest of it had broken away and plunged into the gulf, leaving a short slope down which stones <b>and</b> soil had <b>slid.</b> <b>Its</b> lower edge lay about twelve feet beneath him, though the distance would have been rather less if it could have been measured horizontally.|$|R
5000|$|Mayo {{returned}} to the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final in 2012. Even with Taoiseach Enda Kenny in Rome seeking divine intervention through Pope Benedict XVI the day before, the [...] "Kafkaesque black farce" [...] continued from where it had left off - with Donegal allowed bridge a 20-year gap between titles, helped {{in no small part}} by a nightmare opening quarter for Mayo as Michael Murphy - whose father is from Mayo - launched a rocket of a shot into the goal after three minutes. Then, in the eleventh minute, Colm McFadden seized the ball from the grasp of Kevin Keane <b>and</b> <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> into the net for a second Donegal goal. Mayo only got on the scoresheet after sixteen minutes and never led at any point during the match. They eventually lost with thirteen points to Donegal's two goals and eleven.|$|E

Then, in the eleventh minute, Colm McFadden seized the ball from the grasp of Kevin Keane <b>and</b> <b>slid</b> <b>it</b> into the net for a second Donegal goal. Mayo managed thirteen points to Donegal's two goals and eleven, only got on the scoresheet after sixteen minutes when already two goals behind and never led during the match. 2013 saw Mayo in the final again, and once more coming up short, this time being seen off by Dublin, who won by a single point. 2016 likewise, a single point against Dublin, though this time after a replay; the drawn game featuring two own goals by Mayo players.|$|E

60|$|Hare {{accompanied}} him {{out through the}} grove to a road that flanked the first rise of the red wall; they followed this for half a mile, and turning a corner came into an unobstructed view. A roar of rushing waters had prepared Hare, but the river that he saw appalled him. It was red <b>and</b> swift; <b>it</b> <b>slid</b> onward like an enormous slippery snake; its constricted head raised a crest of leaping waves, and disappeared in a dark chasm, whence came a bellow and boom.|$|R
50|$|The device {{consisted}} of three primary components, an index arm, a radial arm and a graduated chord. The three were arranged in a triangle as in {{the image on the}} right. A telescopic sight was mounted on the index arm. At the point of rotation of the radial arm, a single mirror was mounted. This point of rotation allowed the angle between the index arm and the radial arm to be changed. The graduated chord was connected to {{the opposite end of the}} radial arm and the chord was permitted to rotate about the end. The chord was held against the distant end of the index arm <b>and</b> <b>slid</b> against <b>it.</b> The graduations on the chord were uniform and, by using it to measure the distance between the ends of the index arm and the radial arm, the angle between those arms could be determined. A table of chords was used to convert a measurement of distance to a measurement of angle. The use of the mirror resulted in the measured angle being twice the angle included by the index and the radius arm.|$|R
60|$|Daggett {{had been}} carried over the narrow shelf on which Stimson landed, in {{consequence}} of his having no support, or any means of arresting his momentum. He did thrust forward his lance, or leaping-staff; but its point met nothing but air. The fall, however, {{was by no means}} perpendicular, several projections of the rocks helping to lessen it; though it is probable that the life of the unfortunate sealer was saved altogether by means of the lance. This was beneath him as he made his final descent, <b>and</b> he <b>slid</b> along <b>it</b> the whole length, canting him into a spot where was the only piece of stinted vegetation that was to be seen for a considerable distance. In consequence of coming down on a tolerably thick bunch of furze, the fall was essentially broken.|$|R
