Benjamin and Mary had one child together, Elizabeth (February 21, 1897– December 26, 1955).|$|E
5|$|From its inception, users {{would use}} the {{newsgroup}} to discuss {{the quality of the}} episode, as well as to talk about continuity errors and trivia. They would also discuss cultural references, usually related to pop culture. Another common topic is freeze frame gags, which are jokes that can only be seen when the viewer tapes the episode and freezes the image. All of these many discussions were compiled and submitted to The Simpsons Archive, which contains at least 330 episode guides as well as other guides. The newsgroup also provides The Simpsons Archive with information on the characters and the setting, as well as a compilation of <b>articles</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> show and interview with its cast and crew.|$|E

5|$|Leaving Russia before Reed, {{who wanted}} {{to report on the}} Bolshevik debate about Russian {{participation}} in the war with Germany, Bryant returned to New York, arriving on February 18, 1918. She found Greenwich Village much changed by the war; old friends had moved, rents had gone up, and tourists were replacing bohemians. Under government pressure, The Masses had shut down. Working out of a room at the Brevoort Hotel, Bryant wrote <b>articles</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> October Revolution and speeches or cables urging support of the workers' government in Russia.|$|E

5|$|While Sanger was in Europe, {{her husband}} {{continued}} her work, {{which led to}} his arrest after he distributed {{a copy of a}} birth control pamphlet to an undercover postal worker. The arrest and his 30-day jail sentence prompted several mainstream publications, including Harper's Weekly and the New-York Tribune, to publish <b>articles</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> birth control controversy. Emma Goldman and Ben Reitman toured the country, speaking in support of the Sangers, and distributing copies of Sanger's pamphlet Family Limitation. Sanger's exile and her husband's arrest propelled the birth control movement into the forefront of American news.|$|E
5|$|At L'Ora, De Mauro {{joined a}} group of crack investigative reporters. From the mid-1950s to the 1970s the left-leaning {{newspaper}} often hit the national spotlight for its investigations and denunciations about the ties between the Sicilian Mafia and corrupt politicians. These were the golden years of investigations, signed by journalists like Mauro De Mauro, Felice Chilanti and Mario Farinella. De Mauro could exercise his skills as a successful investigative reporter. He wrote on drug trafficking and the Sack of Palermo, the construction boom in the 1950s and 1960s {{that led to the}} destruction of the city's green belt and ancient villas. He also published <b>articles</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> collusion between the Mafia and politics. In 1960 he was among the winners of the Premiolino, {{one of the most important}} Italian journalism awards, for his crime investigations.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, AVEN members {{participated in}} the first asexual entry into an American pride parade when they walked in the San Francisco Pride Parade. In August 2010, {{after a period of}} debate over having an asexual flag and how to set up a system to create one, and {{contacting}} as many asexual communities as possible, a flag was announced as the asexual pride flag by one of the teams involved. The final flag had been a popular candidate and had previously seen use in online forums outside of AVEN. The final vote was held on a survey system outside of AVEN where the main flag creation efforts were organized. The flag colors have been used in artwork and referenced in <b>articles</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> sexuality.|$|E

5|$|M sends Bond to {{investigate}} Carver after he releases news <b>articles</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> crisis hours before MI6 had learned of it. Bond travels to Hamburg and seduces Carver's wife, Paris, {{who is also}} Bond's ex-girlfriend, to get information that would help him enter Carver's newspaper headquarters. He also knocks out three of Stamper's men and cuts Carver off the air while he is giving a speech during the inaugural broadcast of his satellite network. After Bond steals back the GPS encoder, Carver orders Paris and Bond killed. Paris is murdered by Carver's personal assassin Dr. Kaufman, but Bond kills Kaufman and escapes, protecting the encoder. Bond learns that the encoder had been tampered with, {{and goes to the}} South China Sea {{to investigate}} the wreck (which was actually in Vietnamese waters). He and Wai Lin, a Chinese agent on the same case, explore the sunken ship and discover one of its cruise missiles missing, but are captured by Stamper and taken to the CMGN tower in Saigon. They soon escape and decide to collaborate on the investigation.|$|E

5|$|The {{differences}} between tantalum and niobium were demonstrated unequivocally in 1864 by Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand, and Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville, {{as well as}} by Louis J. Troost, who determined the empirical formulas of some of their compounds in 1865. Further confirmation came from the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac, in 1866, who proved that there were only two elements. These discoveries did not stop scientists from publishing <b>articles</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> so-called ilmenium until 1871. De Marignac was the first to produce the metallic form of tantalum in 1864, when he reduced tantalum chloride by heating it in an atmosphere of hydrogen. Early investigators had only been able to produce impure tantalum, and the first relatively pure ductile metal was produced by Werner von Bolton in Charlottenburg in 1903. Wires made with metallic tantalum were used for light bulb filaments until tungsten replaced it in widespread use.|$|E
