40|$|As {{access to}} DNA {{sequencing}} has become ubiquitous to scientists, {{the use of}} sequencers has expanded from determining the genomes of individuals to performing molecular probing assays. These assays have turned DNA sequencers into molecule counting machines {{and can be used}} to measure biological activities such as gene expression (RNA-Seq), DNA accessibility (ATAC-Seq) and many others. Each new assay poses new analytical challenges, and the main focus presented here is in analyzing RNA-Seq data. One of the main challenges in RNA-Seq is that sequenced fragments are often ambiguous, meaning they are compatible with multiple splice forms or genomic locations. In order to estimate gene abundances effectively, these ambiguous fragments should be used in a comprehensive model in order to not bias results. Analysis {{has come a long way}} from ignoring ambiguous mappings, to maximum likelihood models, and even streaming models. Advancements in these models have greatly improved the accuracy of estimating gene and transcript abundances. In parallel, methods for determining true expression differences between experimental conditions, termed differential expression, have been developed. Historically, these methods have mostly ignored advancements in gene expression estimation but have made much progress in between-sample variance estimation when sample sizes are small [...] a common practice in this field. Herein, we present advancements to both <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation</b> and differential expression analysis. We show dramatic improvements to the speed of <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation</b> while maintaining accuracy.

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{techniques}} are available for assessing populations of vertebrates. However, application of many of those techniques to Galliformes is hampered {{by a variety of}} constraints. These problems are often magnified by poor understanding of the biology of many species of concern, and an absence of valid estimates of abundance and demographic parameters. Researchers interested in developing estimates of Galliformes populations must address a number of key issues before collecting field data, to avoid biases in the resulting population estimates. General guidance exists for the identification of appropriate population estimation techniques, and a dichotomous key has been developed for <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation</b> of other vertebrates, such as mammals. First, we review some of the basic principles of <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation,</b> with the goal of identifying sources of bias, and avoiding these in field surveys. We then develop specific guidelines for Galliformes, and a key to <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation</b> for field researchers. Based on our knowledge of the general biology of Galliformes, the most applicable techniques for estimating abundance are based on variations of distance sampling techniques, mark-resighting techniques, and removal techniques.

However, their use can be made more valuable by employing double sampling or other methods that directly link indices to unbiased estimates of abundance...|$|R

40|$|We review {{three areas}} of recent {{research}} on Hudson River bay anchovy. One {{focus has been}} the along-estuary movement of early life stages. A cohort analysis of samples collected in a spatiotemporally extensive monitoring program has confirmed that early-stage anchovy migrate up-estuary, at an estimated rate of 0. 6 km/d. Complementary fine-scale field sampling was designed to clarify behaviors that effect the migration. This work found that early-stage anchovy can show preferences for depth and can conduct periodic vertical migration. To determine whether these behaviors were sufficient to produce up-estuary migration, larval flux and velocity were estimated. These estimates were consistent with local retention rather than concerted migration. High priority {{should be given to}} examining individual migration histories through analysis of otolith microchemistry. A second focus of research on Hudson anchovy has been on local population structure, permitting comparison to anchovy in other locations. The demography of the Hudson River anchovy appears to be unique. Anchovy that spawn in the Hudson River are larger than those spawning in the Chesapeake Bay region and are mostly two years old, whereas yearlings predominate in other estuaries. Batch fecundity was lower and egg mortality higher in Hudson River than in Chesapeake Bay. A key issue arising from these recent findings {{is the degree to which}} the Hudson anchovy pool is connected with other large anchovy pools, such as Narragansett Bay and Chesapeake Bay. A third focus of research on Hudson anchovy has been analysis of interannual variability in early-stage abundance. A 3 ̆e 20 year time series of juvenile bay <b>anchovy</b> <b>abundance</b> shows that juvenile abundance has varied over one order of magnitude. There has been no significant change in abundance over the entire time series, but abundance has declined 10 -fold since a peak in the late 1980 s. <b>Anchovy</b> <b>abundance</b> was negatively associated with the abundance of early-stage striped bass, and positively associated with the abundance of early-stage tomcod.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem in limnology and oceanography is {{the inability to}} quickly identify and map distributions of plankton. This thesis addresses the problem by applying statistical machine learning to video images collected by an optical sampler, the Video Plankton Recorder (VPR). The research is focused on development of a real-time automatic plankton recognition system to estimate plankton abundance. The system includes four major components: pattern representation/feature measurement, feature extraction/selection, classification, and <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation.</b> After an extensive study on a traditional learning vector quantization (LVQ) neural network (NN) classifier built on shape-based features and different pattern representation methods, I developed a classification system combined multi-scale cooccurrence matrices feature with support vector machine classifier. This new method outperforms the traditional shape-based-NN classifier method by 12 % in classification accuracy. Subsequent plankton abundance estimates are improved in the regions of low relative abundance by more than 50 %. Both the NN and SVM classifiers have no rejection metrics. In this thesis, two rejection metrics were developed. (cont.) One {{was based on the}} Euclidean distance in the feature space for NN classifier. The other used dual classifier (NN and SVM) voting as output. Using the dual-classification method alone yields almost as good <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation</b> as human labeling on a test-bed of real world data. However, the distance rejection metric for NN classifier might be more useful when the training samples are not "good" ie, representative of the field data. In summary, this thesis advances the current state-of-the-art plankton recognition system by demonstrating multi-scale texture-based features are more suitable for classifying field-collected images. The system was verified on a very large real-world dataset in systematic way for the first time. The accomplishments include developing a multi-scale occurrence matrices and support vector machine system, a dual-classification system, automatic correction in <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation,</b> and ability to get accurate <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation</b> from real-time automatic classification. The methods developed are generic and are likely to work on range of other image classification applications. by Qiao Hu. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Abstract Background RNA-seq, a {{next-generation}} sequencing based method for transcriptome analysis, is rapidly {{emerging as the}} method of choice for comprehensive transcript <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation.</b> The accuracy of RNA-seq can be highly impacted by the purity of samples. A prominent, outstanding problem in RNA-seq is how to estimate transcript abundances in heterogeneous tissues, where a sample is composed {{of more than one}} cell type and the inhomogeneity can substantially confound the transcript <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation</b> of each individual cell type. Although experimental methods have been proposed to dissect multiple distinct cell types, computationally "deconvoluting" heterogeneous tissues provides an attractive alternative, since it keeps the tissue sample as well as the subsequent molecular content yield intact. Results Here we propose a probabilistic model-based approach, Transcript Estimation from Mixed Tissue samples (TEMT), to estimate the transcript abundances of each cell type of interest from RNA-seq data of heterogeneous tissue samples. TEMT incorporates positional and sequence-specific biases, and its online EM algorithm only requires a runtime proportional to the data size and a small constant memory. We test the proposed method on both simulation data and recently released ENCODE data, and show that TEMT significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods that do not take tissue heterogeneity into account. Currently, TEMT only resolves the tissue heterogeneity resulting from two cell types, but it can be extended to handle tissue heterogeneity resulting from multi cell types. TEMT is written in python, and is freely available at [URL] Conclusions The probabilistic model-based approach proposed here provides a new method for analyzing RNA-seq data from heterogeneous tissue samples. By applying the method to both simulation data and ENCODE data, we show that explicitly accounting for tissue heterogeneity can significantly improve the accuracy of transcript <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Northeast Atlantic Mackerel (Scomber scombrus) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} and {{economically}} most valuable fish stocks in the world. However, due to a large area of distribution, low acoustic backscatter and highly dynamic and migratory behaviour between several Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), reliable <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation</b> and fish stock assessment are difficult and include a large level of uncertainty. In order to reduce uncertainties in the mackerel stock abundance estimates, a new pelagic trawl methodology and standardized swept-area surveys for mackerel <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation</b> was established in 2011. The new method included development of a new surface trawling method and a new trawl, the multipurpose pelagic ecosystem trawl (Multpelt 832). However, various uncertainty is still linked to the new trawl methodology. This thesis uses Deep Vision images, GoPro videos and total catch data from a methodological cruise conducted in June 2015 as well as catch data from the 2015 International Ecosystem Summer Survey in the Nordic Seas (IESSNS) in order to investigate the demanding curved trawl method used in the IESSNS survey today. The analyses conducted show that the curved trawling method did not have significantly different catch rates or length distribution compared to less demanding straight forward trawling. Consequently, a change of the trawling method used in the IESSNS survey from a curved to a straight forward trawling procedure is recommended in order to simplify trawling. Furthermore, analyses of mackerel distribution during the methodological survey indicate small shoaling and loosely aggregating behaviour within individual hauls. Patchiness rarely led to only a single or few aggregations being encountered over the course of 30 -minute- long hauls, supporting the use of a swept area survey for mackerel in this location and time. The swept area method in the IESSNS survey therefore seems to be a reliable and consistent method for <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation</b> of NEA mackerel...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a decline in both size and the {{geographical}} distribution of the sandeel stock. The decline has been particularly profound in the Norwegian economic zone where the sandeel play an important part {{not only in terms of}} economic interests, but also in transferring energy from the planktonic society to the higher trophic levels. If there are not enough copepods to feed on, the sandeel along with several other animals would lose its basis of existence. As a part of the IMR SMASSC (Survey methods for <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation</b> of sandeel (Ammodytes marinus) stocks) project it was decided to develop methods for acoustic identification and <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation</b> of copepods. This was done by comparing biological samples to acoustic abundance estimates using multi frequency methods with the operating frequencies 18, 38, 120 and 200 kHz collected in 2010. These data were to be compared with data collected in 2009 with six operating frequencies 18, 38, 70, 120, 200 and 333 kHz. Results from these studies indicate that 333 kHz is required in most cases to identify copepods, and that the copepod distribution is far too heterogeneous for biological net samples alone to be reliable. Acoustic methods are better suited for mapping geographical distribution of copepods and may also be better suited for <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation</b> of copepods than the time consuming net sampling methods. In addition, sandeel (Ammodyte marinus) digestion rate and gastric evacuation rate were monitored in a tankt.

High-resolution (sub-meter) commercial satellite imagery (e. g., Worldview- 1, Quickbird) is capable of colony detection and <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation</b> for both large and small colonies, and has already been used in a continental-scale survey of Adélie penguins. Medium-resolution Landsat imagery has been used successfully to detect the presence of breeding penguins, but has not been used previously for <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation</b> nor evaluated in terms of its minimum colony size detection threshold. We report on the first comprehensive analysis of the performance of these two methods for both detection and <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation,</b> identify the sensor-specific failure modes that can lead to both false positives and false negatives, and compare the abundance estimates of each method over multiple spatial scales. We find that errors of omission using Landsat imagery are low for colonies larger than ∼ 10, 000 breeding pairs. Both high-resolution and Landsat imagery can be used to obtain unbiased estimates of abundance, and while Landsat-derived abundance estimates have high variance for individual breeding colonies relative to estimates derived from high-resolution imagery, this difference declines as the spatial domain of interest is increased. At the continental scale, abundance estimates using the two methods are roughly equivalent. Our comparison of these two methods represents a bridge between the more developed high-resolution imagery, which can be expensive to obtain, and the medium-resolution Landsat- 7 record, which is freely available; this comparison of methodologies represents an essential step towards integration of these disparate sources of data for regional assessments of Adélie population abundance and distribution...|$|R

The spatial resolution of most Hyperspectral Imagery (HSI) sensors flown nowadays {{is larger than the}} size of the objects being observed. Therefore, the measured spectral signature is a mixture of the signatures of the objects in the field of view of the sensor. The high spectral resolution can be used to de-compose the measured spectra into its constituents. This is the so-called unmixing problem in HSI. Spectral unmixing is the process by which the measured spectrum is decomposed into a collection of constituent spectra, or endmembers, and a set of corresponding fractions or abundances. Unmixing allows us to detect and classify subpixel objects by their con-tribution to the measured spectral signal.

40|$|Passive {{acoustic}} monitoring {{has been}} used to investigate many aspects of marine mammal ecology, although methods to estimate absolute abundance and density using acoustic data have only been developed in recent years. The instrument configuration in an acoustic survey determines which <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation</b> methods can be used. Sparsely distributed arrays of instruments are useful because wide geographic areas can be covered. However, instrument spacing in sparse arrays is such that the same vocalisation will not be detected on multiple instruments, excluding the use of some <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation</b> methods. The aim of this thesis was to explore cetacean <b>abundance</b> and density <b>estimation</b> using novel sparse array datasets, applying existing methods where possible, or developing new approaches. The wealth of data collected by sparse arrays was demonstrated by analysing a 10 -year dataset collected by the U. S. Navy’s Sound Surveillance System in the north-east Atlantic. Spatial and temporal patterns of blue (Balaenoptera musculus) and fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) vocal activity were investigated using generalised additive models. Distance sampling-based methods were applied to fin whale calls recorded by an array of Ocean Bottom Seismometers in the north-east Atlantic. Estimated call density was 993 calls/ 1000 km². hr⁻¹ (CV: 0. 39). Animal density could not be estimated because the call rate was unknown. Further development of the call localisation method is required so the current density estimate may be biased. Furthermore, analysing a single day of data resulted in a high variance estimate. Finally, a new simulation-based method developed to estimate density from single hydrophones was applied to blue whale calls recorded in the northern Indian Ocean. Estimated call density was 3 calls/ 1000 km². hr⁻¹ (CV: 0. 17). Again, density of whales could not be estimated as the vocalisation rate was unknown.

30|$|Rapid <b>abundance</b> <b>estimation</b> and {{sequence}} classification tools [16, 17] use longer words and derive a large speed advantage by utilizing, instead of word counts, a simple match between the words extracted from sequence data {{to identify the}} similarity between two sequences. However, this approach comes {{at the cost of}} storing {{a very large number of}} sequence words to make accurate classifications. For example, the extraction of k= 30 base words results in 430 ≈ 1018 unique word possibilities within the training data feature space when an alphabet of four symbols (A,C,G,T) is considered.|$|R
