5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> autumn song would – you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E
500|$|The word gomen (game) {{is found}} 18 times in Gawain. Its {{similarity}} {{to the word}} gome (man), which appears 21 times, has led some scholars to see men and games as centrally linked. Games at this time were seen as tests of worthiness, as when the Green Knight challenges the court's right to its good name in a [...] "Christmas game". The [...] "game" [...] of exchanging gifts was common in Germanic cultures. If a man received a gift, he was obliged to provide the giver with a better gift or risk losing his honour, <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> exchange of blows in a fight (or in a [...] "beheading game"). The poem revolves around two games: an exchange of beheading and an exchange of winnings. These appear at first to be unconnected. However, {{a victory in the}} first game will lead to a victory in the second. Elements of both games appear in other stories; however, the linkage of outcomes is unique to Gawain.|$|E
500|$|Introspection {{was also}} listed {{as one of}} the {{foundational}} themes prevalent on the album, along with [...] "genuine statements of personal and careerist reflection scattered among the posturing of 'Bitch I'm Madonna' and 'Unapologetic Bitch'" [...] according to Slant Magazines Sam C. Mac as well as her [...] "obsessive self-regard". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of The New York Times that although she has never looked back at her past endeavors, reminiscing about it felt right for Rebel Heart. [...] "And it's bittersweet for me to think about that. It just seemed like a time where I wanted to stop and look back. It's kind of like survivor guilt. How did I make it and they didn't?" [...] During the album's development phase, she became comfortable expressing her ideas in front of a few people, comparing it to: [...] "writing your diary in front of somebody and reading it out loud... It was <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> acting exercise, you know, just putting myself in a room and letting ideas flow even if I didn't feel so connected to the people".|$|E

500|$|Human {{evolution}} and {{the resilience of}} life may {{also be seen as}} key themes of Gravity. The film opens with the exploration of spacethe climax of human civilizationand ends with an allegory of the dawn of mankind when Dr. Ryan Stone fights her way out of the water after the crash-landing, passing a frog, grabs the soil, and slowly regains her capacity to stand upright and walk. Director Cuarón said, [...] "She’s in these murky waters <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> amniotic fluid or a primordial soup. In which you see amphibians swimming. She crawls out of the water, not unlike early creatures in evolution. And then she goes on all fours. And after going on all fours she’s a bit curved until she is completely erect. It was the evolution of life in one, quick shot". Other imagery depicting the formation of life includes a scene in which Stone rests in an embryonic position, surrounded by a rope strongly resembling an umbilical cord. Stone's return from space, accompanied by meteorite-like debris, may be seen as a hint that elements essential to the development of life on Earth may have come from outer space in the form of meteorites.|$|E
500|$|On March 7, 1999, {{six days}} after {{screening}} a final cut of Eyes Wide Shut for his family and the stars, Kubrick died in his sleep {{at the age of}} 70, after suffering a massive heart attack. His funeral was held five days later at his home estate at Childwickbury Manor, with only close friends and family in attendance, totaling approximately 100 people. The media were kept a mile away outside the entrance gate. Alexander Walker, who attended the funeral, describes it as a [...] "family farewell,... <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> English picnic", with cellists, clarinetists and singers providing song and music from many of his favorite classical compositions. Kaddish, the Jewish prayer of mourning, was recited. A few of his obituaries mentioned his Jewish background. Among those who gave eulogies were Terry Semel, Jan Harlan, Steven Spielberg, Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise. He was buried next to his favorite tree on the estate. In her book dedicated to Kubrick, his wife Christiane included one of his favorite quotations of Oscar Wilde: [...] "The tragedy of old age is not that one is old, but that one is young." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Stairway to Heaven" [...] {{is often}} rated among the {{greatest}} rock songs of all time. According to music journalist Stephen Davis, although {{the song was}} released in 1971, it took until 1973 before the song's popularity ascended to truly [...] "anthemic" [...] status. As Page himself recalled, [...] "I knew it was good, but I didn't know {{it was going to}} be <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> anthem ... But I knew it was the gem of the album, sure." ...|$|E

2500|$|Light {{from the}} sun hitting lunar dust causes it to become charged through the {{photoelectric}} effect. The charged dust then repels itself and lifts off {{the surface of the}} Moon by electrostatic levitation. This manifests itself <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> [...] "atmosphere of dust", visible as a thin haze and blurring of distant features, and visible as a dim glow after the sun has set. This was first photographed by the Surveyor program probes in the 1960s.

She added that Black was her great friend [...] "But I've also found a great friend in her. <b>Almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> older sister to me.

He sent his subordinates to visit Taishi Ci's mother on multiple occasions and passed her many gifts. In the late 180s or early 190s, when Beihai came under attack by Yellow Turban rebels, Kong Rong led his troops to a fortress at Duchang (都昌; in present-day Weifang, Shandong). The rebels, led by Guan Hai (管亥), besieged the Duchang fortress. After Taishi Ci returned from Liaodong, his mother told him, [...] "You haven't met Kong Rong. He treated me very generously – <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> old friend – while you were away. Now {{that he is in}} trouble, you should quickly go to help him." [...] Three days later, Taishi Ci travelled alone on foot to Duchang.|$|E

She’s looking super-duper fly and whatnot." [...] The video is a tribute to Japanese anime. Nicki also commented on the video shoot and its theme, stating [...] "We’re doing <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> ode to Japanese culture and Japanese anime. I’m obviously a big fan and I’ve joined forces with like the only boy that I know that’s also able to capture that culture." [...] A behind the scenes video was released along with the interview. This is however in contrast to both the spoken introduction of the video and the words popping up during the video; the words are written in hangul, the Korean alphabet, and the intro is spoken in Korean.|$|E
2500|$|Her mad scene {{appeared}} to owe little to tradition and seemed <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> improvisation, with several contemporary accounts remarking on her astonishing capacity for mime. Her performances produced an extraordinary reaction: men wept openly in the theater, {{and when they}} left were [...] "convulsed by uncontrollable emotion." [...] The twenty-five-year-old Alexandre Dumas, père, {{who was about to}} embark on a major career as a novelist and dramatist, was in the audience and found the performance revelatory, [...] "far surpassing all my expectations". The French composer Hector Berlioz was also present at that opening night performance and later wrote: [...] "The lightning flash of that sublime discovery opened before me at a stroke the whole heaven of art, illuminating it to its remotest depths. I recognized the meaning of dramatic grandeur, beauty, truth." [...] Even the wife of the English ambassador, Lady Granville, felt compelled to report that the Parisians [...] "roar over Miss Smithson's Ophelia, and strange to say so did I". (The actress's Irish accent and the lack of power in her voice had hindered her success in London.) It wasn't long before new clothing and hair styles, à la mode d'Ophélie and modeled on those of the actress, became all the rage in Paris.|$|E
2500|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Live Through This began on October 8, 1993 at Triclops Sound Studios in Marietta, Georgia. The studio was booked at {{the recommendation of}} The Smashing Pumpkins, who had recorded their second studio album, Siamese Dream (1993) there. The assigned producers were Paul Q. Kolderie and Sean Slade. The first week of recording was spent recording basic tracks, including drums, bass, scratch guitars, and scratch vocals. After basic tracks were completed, Love's husband, Kurt Cobain, joined the band in-studio before Nirvana were set to tour to promote In Utero. Cobain was presented with the basic tracks and the band invited Cobain to sing on a few unfinished numbers. Cobain initially refused, due to being unfamiliar with the material. When Cobain asked, [...] "how can I sing on it if I haven't heard it?," [...] Love answered by encouraging him to [...] "just sing {{off the top of}} [...] head." [...] Cobain is known to have provided backing vocals to [...] "Asking for It" [...] and [...] "Softer, Softest," [...] however Kolderie has said Cobain [...] "sang on about five or so , probably [...] "Violet", [...] "Miss World" [...] and [...] "Doll Parts, I can't remember any of the others." [...] After taking a break for dinner, the session devolved into a [...] "formless jam" [...] with Cobain on drums, Love and Erlandson on guitars and producer Sean Slade on bass. Dana Kletter (blackgirls, Dish, Dear Enemy) was asked to sing backing vocals on the record, and appears on seven songs, including Violet, Miss World, Asking For It, Doll Parts, Softer Softest, and She Walks On Me. Producer Sean Slade said, [...] "I {{think one of the reasons}} that Doll Parts might have been a hit is that harmony Dana does on the You will ache like I ache part, it's <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> Appalachian close harmony against what Courtney is doing. It's very melancholic." [...] There have been rumors that Kletter did more than sing backing vocals, but the band denies it.|$|E
