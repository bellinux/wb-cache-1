In Creative Thinking Ability Level 2, the student was able to make one new answer (that could be made by other students in common thinking ability level). In this matter, the student could solve the problem according to something he was thinking about. Thus, the obtained answer would appear different <b>with</b> other <b>student</b> and did not follow a certain pattern. Four students, who belonged to Creative Thinking Ability Level 0 were <b>a</b> male <b>student</b> <b>with</b> average motivation, <b>a</b> female <b>student</b> <b>with</b> average motivation, <b>a</b> male <b>student</b> <b>with</b> low motivation, and <b>a</b> female <b>student</b> <b>with</b> low motivation.

25|$|Admission to {{a two-year}} pre-university course at junior colleges {{after graduating from}} {{secondary}} school {{is determined by the}} L1R5 (English + 5 relevant subjects) scoring system. This scoring system is based on the 'O' Level subject grades, which range from A1 (best) to F9 (worst). The candidate adds the numerical grades for six different subjects: English (or another language taken at the 'first language' level), a Humanities subject, a Science/Mathematics subject, a Humanities/Science/Mathematics subject, and two other subjects of any kind. The best L1R5 unmodified score is therefore 6, for <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>with</b> A1 grades in six subjects which meet the criteria.|$|E

25|$|Like {{all other}} {{students}}, {{students with disabilities}} experience sexual harassment in school as both victims and perpetrators. Some disabilities could cause a lack of control over impulses, a lack of awareness {{of the effects of}} their words and actions, and a lack of social skills needed to avoid sexually harassing behavior. In some circumstances, <b>a</b> <b>student</b> <b>with</b> disabilities could exhibit a behavior that would constitute sexual harassment without intentionally trying to be malicious or inappropriate. In these cases, where a disability could lead to sexually harassing behaviors, positive behavior intervention plans are often put into place by a team often including parents, school administrators, general education teachers, special education teachers, school psychologists, and counselors. These types of plans could also be made during Individualized Education Programmeetings regarding the student.|$|E
