5|$|Attachments between {{infants and}} {{caregivers}} form {{even if this}} caregiver is not sensitive and responsive in social interactions with them. This has important implications. Infants cannot exit unpredictable or insensitive caregiving relationships. Instead they must manage themselves <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> within such relationships. Based on her established Strange Situation Protocol, research by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth in the 1960s and 1970s found that children will have different patterns of attachment depending primarily on how they experienced their early caregiving environment. Early patterns of attachment, in turn, shape — but do not determine — the individual's expectations in later relationships.|$|E

25|$|Hermeneutic counselors {{advocate}} his {{same process}} {{can be used in}} counseling to envision the bodily experiences of others in reality. For example, a client may present with tears while verbalizing feelings of pain and humiliation in response to a break up with a significant other. A therapist, using his memory of past embodied experiences of relationship heartache, can empathically envision in his imagination very closely to what the client is experiencing, therefore sharing that experience with the client and in turn enabling him to authentically relate to the client. Furthermore, this is precisely what enables the therapist and the client to work together to imagine new therapeutic possibilities. Mensch states that this capacity of human beings necessitates their responsibility to relate to and understand others <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>can.</b> Humans may not always be able to, or entirely be able to, but their co-existence as embodied beings demands that they make the attempt.|$|E

5000|$|Many domains contain {{multiple}} displays, {{and require}} {{more than a simple}} discrete yes/no response time measurement. A critical question for these situations may be [...] "How much time will operators spend looking at X relative to Y?" [...] or [...] "What is the likelihood that the operator will completely miss seeing a critical event?" [...] Visual sampling is the primary means of obtaining information from the world. An early model in this domain is Sender's (1964, 1983) based upon operators monitoring of multiple dials, each with different rates of change. Operators try, <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> to reconstruct the original set of dials based on discrete sampling. This relies on the mathematical Nyquist theorem stating that a signal at W Hz can be reconstructed by sampling every 1/W seconds. This was combined with a measure of the information generation rate for each signal, to predict the optimal sampling rate and dwell time for each dial. Human limitations prevent human performance from matching optimal performance, but the predictive power of the model influenced future work in this area, such as Sheridan's (1970) extension of the model with considerations of access cost and information sample value.|$|R
