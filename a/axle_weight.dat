5|$|CMVs are {{required}} to pass through weigh stations at the borders of most states and some large cities. These weigh stations are run by state DOTs, and CMV weight and size enforcement is overseen by the FHWA. Weigh stations check each vehicle's gross weight and <b>axle</b> <b>weight</b> using a set of in-ground truck scales, and are usually where a truck's compliance with the formula is checked.|$|E
5|$|World War I {{proved to}} be a boom for the Meråker Line. The line {{suddenly}} became a transit corridor for shipments from Russia, as well as from Sweden, to the ports in Trondheim and Hommelvik. To cope with the increased traffic, NSB had to both rent equipment from Sweden and acquire ten new Class 21 and Class 35 locomotives between 1913 and 1918. Four of these were transferred from other lines, while six were new. With the new locomotives, the dimensioned <b>axle</b> <b>weight</b> needed to be upgraded to , which mostly involved improving the bridges. The bridge at Funna was dismounted and sold to be used on the Gråkallen Line of the Trondheim Tramway. Class 35 was used on the Gudå–Storlien section, and replaced the aging Class 14. They remained in service until 1929, when they were transferred to the Ofoten Line.|$|E

IRD's weigh-in-motion systems are used at highway inspection stations to sort vehicles, ensuring only overweight vehicles are stopped for inspection.

IRD's WIM systems are also used by fleet managers to ensure vehicles are leaving terminals within the acceptable weight limits for their classification.|$|R

25|$|In 1999, NSB {{announced}} {{that they would be}} rebranding their services, and that commuter trains would be branded at NSB Puls. They would lose their traditional red color and instead be colored green and silver, with the Class 72 being the first trains to receive the new design. In February 2001, the first train arrived to Norway for testing. The delay was caused by errors in the drawings and the bankruptcy of a supplier. In April it was {{announced that}} the trains were too heavy to allow standing passengers, since the trains could then exceed the permitted <b>axle</b> <b>weight.</b> To reduce the weight, the trains needed to have some steel parts replaced with aluminium. NSB stated that the situation was problematic both because they had calculated the need for standing places to handle rush-hour traffic, and because it was impossible for them to control if more people than there were seats for would board a train. NSB stated that part of the problem was that they could not order shelf ware, in part because the Norwegian loading gauge is wider than in Continental Europe. By September, a solution had been found whereby the weight had been reduced sufficiently that 350 standing passengers could be taken on each train. The trains were delivered with the train radio system Scanet, but the technology was so out of date that there was only a five-year warranty. At the time, it was uncertain when Global System for Mobile Communications – Railway (GSM-R) would be built for the Norwegian rail network, and NSB feared there could arise {{a situation in which the}} trains could not be used, if the construction were not accelerated.|$|E
40|$|Weigh-In-Motion (WIM) and Bridge Weigh-In-Motion (B-WIM) are {{systems that}} allow obtaining the <b>axle</b> <b>weights</b> of road {{vehicles}} in motion, at normal traffic speeds. While WIM employs sensors {{embedded in the}} road pavement, B-WIM use the strain recordings of a bridge to infer the traversing vehicle <b>axle</b> <b>weights.</b> Both systems have been heavily improved over the past decades, and commercial versions are currently in operation. The two main applications of these systems are: (1) to assess the traffic loading on the infrastructure, and (2) to enforce the maximum weight limits. This paper suggests a novel application of these two systems to identify changes in bridge stiffness. It requires the bridge to be instrumented with a B-WIM system and a WIM system nearby. The principle is to use both systems to evaluate the gross weight of vehicles passing over the bridge and correlate their predictions. Changes in correlation of the predicted <b>axle</b> <b>weights</b> over time will indicate either structural damage or faulty sensor. A finite element model of a coupled vehicle-bridge system with different damage scenarios is {{used to test the}} approach numerically.

2500|$|Increased {{transportation}} of freight by heavy road vehicles also increased the wear on roads and led first to a [...] "wetted tax" [...] for steam road locomotives, {{followed by the}} adoption of the recommendations of the Salter Report of 1933 for all heavy vehicles. This addressed a perception that the free use of roads was unfairly subsidising the railway's competitors, through the introduction of an additional <b>axle</b> <b>weight</b> duty within the VED in order to charge commercial motor vehicles for the costs they generated. There were exceptions for vehicles that seldom used public roads, such as agricultural tractors. This annual duty was payable by all road hauliers in proportion to the axle load and had the effect of removing many heavy steam-powered vehicles from the road. It was accompanied by changes in legislation that relieved local authorities of some of their costs through new abilities to set weight and speed limits.|$|E
