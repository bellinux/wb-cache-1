5|$|Pet {{birds are}} kept in their millions, as are {{domestic}} fowls, bantams, and pigeons. These last had an important effect on evolutionary biology, as Charles Darwin took an especial interest in pigeon fancying, adopted the hobby himself, and made use of the wide variation between breeds as <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> the power of selection in his 1859 Origin of Species.|$|E
5|$|Dawkins is an atheist, and is {{well known}} for his {{criticism}} of creationism and intelligent design. In The Blind Watchmaker (1986), he argues against the watchmaker analogy, <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. In The God Delusion (2006), Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion. He opposes the teaching of creationism in schools.|$|E
5|$|Further work on {{the model}} has shown that a slight {{difference}} in assumptions can produce completely different results. For example, Eaton and Grossmann showed that if the firms compete in prices rather in quantities (Bertrand competition rather than Cournot) then the optimal policy is an export tax rather a subsidy – a policy rarely used in practice, politically unpopular and contrary to protectionist sentiment which generally touted New Trade Theory models as <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> their favored policies.|$|E

These works show that Euler was a devout Christian who believed the Bible to be inspired; the Rettung was primarily <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> the divine inspiration of scripture.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding that in NASA's {{judgment}} {{the contractor}} later made {{significant progress in}} overcoming the problems, the committee believes {{it should have been}} informed of the situation. The committee does not object to the position of the Administrator of NASA, that all details of Government/contractor relationships should not be put in the public domain. However, that position in no way can be used as <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> not bringing this or other serious situations {{to the attention of the}} committee.|$|E
5|$|Playa de Oro {{virus was}} {{identified}} as a new species in 2008 and is most closely related to Bayou virus, Catacamas virus, Muleshoe virus, and Black Creek Canal virus, found in other species of Oryzomys and Sigmodon. Catacamas virus is found in a different population of Oryzomys couesi, and the presence of different viruses in these two species has been used as <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> classifying the two populations of the host as separate species.|$|E

5|$|The multi-genus {{approach}} is {{based solely on}} the structure of the male flowers; no other characters could be consistently associated with one genus or another. Four of the genera—Attalea (in a narrow sense), Orbignya, Maximiliana and Scheelea—correspond to four different types of male flowers found within the genus. However, a few species have flowers that are intermediate between these four types, including A.colenda (which Glassman placed in its own genus, Ynesa) and this has been used as <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> the single-genus approach. In addition, there are several hybrids between species that would be considered different genera under Glassman's five-genus system, which has also been used as <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> placing them in a single genus. In 2009 Alan Meerow and colleagues published a molecular phylogeny of the subtribe which found that some species placed in Orbignya were actually more closely related to species placed in Scheelea than they were to other members of that genus (if the five-genus approach was used), while A.crassispatha, placed in Orbignya by Glassman, was actually a sister to both Scheelea and Orbignya.|$|E
5|$|Attalea {{is a large}} genus of palms {{native to}} Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America. This pinnately leaved, non-spiny genus {{includes}} both small palms lacking an aboveground stem and large trees. The genus has a complicated taxonomic history, and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers. Since the genera can only be distinguished {{on the basis of}} their male flowers, the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> keeping them all in the same genus. This has been supported by a recent molecular phylogeny.|$|E
5|$|Following Buckingham’s {{death in}} 1628, {{when it was}} safer to do so, a {{translation}} of a history by Pierre Matthieu was published under the title, The Powerful Favourite, the life of Aelius Sejanus. This was followed in 1634 by another translation, Sir Thomas Hawkins' Politicall Observations upon the Fall of Sejanus, which had originally been titled Della peripetia di fortuna (Of Changes of Fortune) by its author, Giovanni Battista Manzini. Later in the century Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, {{was the target of}} the four-page political pamphlet Sejanus, or The popular favourite, now in his solitude, and sufferings, signed with the pseudonym Timothy Tory (1681). The story of Sejanus, with reference to the Earl's imprisonment in the Tower on a charge of treason, is interpreted as <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> absolute monarchy, direct rule without the intermediary of politicians.|$|E

5|$|Henry was an intellectual. The first English king with {{a modern}} humanist education, he read and wrote English, French and Latin, and was {{thoroughly}} {{at home in}} his well-stocked library. He personally annotated many books and wrote and published one of his own. To promote the {{public support for the}} reformation of the church, Henry had numerous pamphlets and lectures prepared. For example, Richard Sampson's Oratio (1534) was <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> absolute obedience to the monarchy and claimed that the English church had always been independent from Rome. At the popular level, theatre and minstrel troupes funded by the crown travelled around the land to promote the new religious practices: the pope and Catholic priests and monks were mocked as foreign devils, while the glorious king was hailed as a brave and heroic defender of the true faith. Henry worked hard to present an image of unchallengeable authority and irresistible power.|$|E
5|$|The {{argument}} from morality is <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> {{the existence of}} God. Arguments from morality tend {{to be based on}} moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. The {{argument from}} morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E
5|$|The sum of a {{geometric}} series {{is itself a}} result even older than Euler. A typical 18th-century derivation used a term-by-term manipulation similar to the algebraic proof given above, and as late as 1811, Bonnycastle's textbook An Introduction to Algebra uses such <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> {{geometric series}} to justify the same maneuver on 0.999... A 19th-century reaction against such liberal summation methods resulted in the definition that still dominates today: the sum of a series is defined to be the limit of the sequence of its partial sums. A corresponding proof of the theorem explicitly computes that sequence; {{it can be found}} in any proof-based introduction to calculus or analysis.|$|E

5|$|In November 2009 Cameron {{and others}} {{distributed}} free copies of an altered version of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species {{on college campuses}} in the United States. The book consisted of Darwin's text with chapters of the book removed, and with an added introduction by Ray Comfort reiterating common creationist assertions about Darwin and evolution. The book was criticized by scientists and Darwin biographers who criticized the omission of key chapters of the book, and who stated that its introduction contains misinformation about Darwin, and long-refuted creationist arguments about the science of evolution, such as the linking of Nazi racial theories to Darwinist ideas. Comfort later said that the four chapters were chosen at random to be omitted {{in order to make}} the book small enough to be affordable as a giveaway, with the absent chapters available for download, but that the missing chapters were included in the second edition, which had a smaller text size that made printing the entire book as a giveaway affordable. The second edition still lacks Darwin's preface and glossary of terms. The National Center for Science Education arranged a campaign to distribute an analysis of the Comfort introduction and a banana bookmark at colleges across the U.S., a reference to Comfort's presentation of the banana as <b>an</b> <b>argument</b> <b>for</b> the existence of God.|$|E
