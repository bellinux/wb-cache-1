500|$|When {{the news}} of Selena's death broke, some Americans asked who she was {{and said she was}} [...] "not that important", {{suggesting}} Latinos [...] "get over it". Author and Texas Monthly magazine contributor Joe Nick Patoski said Anglo-Americans and Mexican-Americans were divided in their reactions to Selena's death. Patoski said that Anglo-Americans [...] "didn't understand what all the fuss was about". This was echoed in the Corpus Christi Caller Times, where they found racial divisions in the reactions to Selena's death. Educators who had observed the reactions said, [...] "the emergence of an icon in a minority culture can be both bewildering and threatening to Anglos". Melicent Rothschild said some Americans often do not understand [...] "the cultural role models of groups who have felt discriminated against". Following Selena's death, cultural confrontations were reported. some vocally opposed any memorials to the singer, feeling they would be costed to taxpayers. Others complained to newspapers <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> interest in Selena's death. Many media outlets received negative comments from people around the country. some were baffled that the Rossler massacre, which occurred around the same time of Selena's death, did not generate the same amount of media exposure. Mayor Mary Rhodes said many of the people complaining <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> exposure Selena was receiving had never heard of her.|$|E
500|$|On October 18, 2003, [...] "Everytime" [...] was {{performed}} by Britney {{for the very first}} time during the twenty-ninth season of the American comedy show Saturday Night Live. She also performed it at Britney Spears: In the Zone, a concert special that aired in ABC on November 17, 2003. [...] "Everytime" [...] was also performed by Spears at 2004's The Onyx Hotel Tour. Before the tour began, Spears said that it was one of the songs she was looking most forward to perform, explaining, [...] "I really think I'm talking to everyone when I perform 'Everytime'". It was the first song of the third act, titled [...] "Mystic Garden". It began with a video interlude in which Spears walked into a garden wearing a rainbow-colored dress and sat in a flower-covered piano. As the video ended, it was revealed that she was sitting onstage in a similar setting. She started the performance talking to the audience <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> coverage of her personal life. She played the piano and sang until the second verse, where she stood up and walked to the center of the stage to continue the performance. Neil Strauss of The New York Times commented, [...] "It was the only song that she appeared to sing unaccompanied by backing tapes". Kelefa Sanneh of Blender called it the best performance of the show.|$|E

500|$|The fifth song, [...] "Illuminati", was {{inspired}} after Madonna learnt {{that she was}} considered {{as one of the}} Illuminati's members. She decided to research about the real Illuminati and then wrote the song. Lyrically it refers to the Illuminati conspiracy theory, the Egyptian pyramids, the Phoenix, the Age of Enlightenment, and the Eye of Providence among others, with the chorus lyrics: [...] "It's like everybody in this party is shining like Illuminati". According to Madonna, Kanye West, who produced the track, loved the melody and changed the composition adding his own spin to it. Minaj appears on the sixth track, [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna", where she raps, asking everybody to [...] "go hard or go home", while Madonna shouts lyrics like: [...] "I just want to have fun tonight, I wanna blow up this house tonight". Produced by Diplo and Sophie, the track has a tearing sound alongside the [...] "bleepy electro" [...] and [...] "churning dubstep" [...] composition. During the writing sessions, Minaj had to rewrite the lyrics until she could get the correct sentiment Madonna wanted. [...] "Hold Tight" [...] consists of an [...] "arresting" [...] chorus and a drum beat sound, described by Sam C. Mac of Slant Magazine as: [...] "innocuous, lyrically platitudinous pop that briefly works itself up into something exciting when it threatens to become a gospelized stomp". Track eight, [...] "Joan of Arc", is a ballad in which Madonna sings <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> scrutiny of her life, singing: [...] "Each time they take a photograph, I lose a part of me I can't get back". It also references the Roman Catholic saint of the same name. Madonna's hushed, vibrato-tinged vocals, and confessional lyrics in [...] "Joan of Arc", are enhanced by a new beat instrumentation that utilizes strings and acoustic guitars in the bridge.|$|E

2500|$|In 1989 the Whitney Museum and its guest curator Marvin Heiferman asked Koons {{to make an}} artwork <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> on a {{billboard}} for the show [...] "Image World: Art and Media Culture". The billboard was meant as an advertisement for an unmade movie, entitled Made in Heaven. Koons employed his then-wife Ilona Staller ("Cicciolina") as a model in the shoot that {{formed the basis of}} the resulting work for the Whitney, Made in Heaven (1990–91). Including works with such titles as Dirty Ejaculation and Ilonaʼs *******, the series of enormous grainy photographs printed on canvas, glassworks, and sculptures portrayed Koons and Staller in highly explicit sexual positions and created considerable controversy. The paintings of the series reference art from the Baroque and Rococo periods—among others, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Jean-Honoré Fragonard and François Boucher—and also draw upon the breakthroughs of early modern painters as Gustave Courbet and Édouard Manet.|$|E
2500|$|After making Prehistory of the Partisans, {{which showed}} student {{radicals}} at Kyoto University {{from inside the}} barricades, for Ogawa Productions, Tsuchimoto began his most famous work, a series of documentaries about the mercury poisoning incident in Minamata, Japan. Disturbed that an earlier effort to film Minamata disease for a television documentary had met with resistance from those afflicted, apparently due to suspicions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>media,</b> Tsuchimoto this time dedicated himself to working with the victims. In the first, and most famous film in the series, [...] (1971), he let the victims speak for themselves, giving {{their side of the}} story, which was not being represented in the mass media or recognized by Chisso, the polluter, and the government. He did not just show their plight to others, but worked to show his films in the area to educate other victims. According to the critic Chris Fujiwara, [...] "Tsuchimoto’s cinema embodies a search for a point of view capable of representing {{the point of view of}} his subjects, and an immersion of the filmmaker’s subjectivity in the contradictions of his material." ...|$|E

2500|$|Church's {{personal}} life {{has often been}} portrayed in UK tabloid newspapers, inspiring the song [...] "Let's Be Alone" [...] on her album Tissues and Issues. At age 15 she was criticised for remarks she made about the behaviour {{of people in the}} aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks. At the Leveson Inquiry she stated that her comments were taken vastly out of context. In a 2006 interview with Davina McCall, she agreed being diplomatic was [...] "not in her nature". In November 2011, Church testified before the Leveson Inquiry <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> intrusion into her {{personal life}} stating [...] "I've been made a caricature for so long, and this person portrayed in the tabloids really isn't me.

[...] On 27 February 2012 Church accepted £600,000 in damages and costs in settlement of a lawsuit arising out of the News International phone hacking scandal. She had claimed that 33 stories about her that appeared in the News of the World were the product of illegal hacking into her family's voicemail. After the settlement was announced in open court she made a lengthy statement in which she said, [...] "I have also discovered that despite the apology which the newspaper has just given in court, these people were prepared to go to any lengths to prevent me exposing their behaviour. They are not truly sorry. They are just sorry they got caught." ...|$|E
