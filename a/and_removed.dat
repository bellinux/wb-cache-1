5|$|After 1728, Hylton's second son, John Hylton, de jure 18th Baron Hylton added a {{complementary}} south wing (its foundation wall still extant), crenellations to both wings <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> {{the door on}} the north wing. He also changed the circular bartizan on {{the north end of the}} west front, to an octagonal turret <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> the portcullis from the west entrance.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} logic with the dynamic modal {{operators}} copy <b>and</b> <b>remove.</b> The copy operator replicates a given model, <b>and</b> the <b>remove</b> operator removes paths {{in a given}} model. We show that the product update by an action model (with Boolean pre-conditions) in dynamic epistemic logic decomposes in copy <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> operations. We also show that copy <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> operators (of path of length 1) can be expressed by action models. We investigate {{the complexity of the}} satisfiability problem of syntactic fragments of the logic with copy <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> operations...|$|R
25|$|This {{behavior}} can be axiomatized in various ways. For example, a common VDM (Vienna Development Method) description of a stack defines top (peek) <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> as atomic, where top returns the top value (without modifying the stack), <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> modifies the stack (without returning a value). In this case pop is {{defined in terms of}} top <b>and</b> <b>remove.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} logic with the dynamic modal {{operators}} copy <b>and</b> <b>remove.</b> The copy operator replicates a given model, <b>and</b> the <b>remove</b> operator removes paths {{in a given}} model. We show that the product update by an action model in dynamic epistemic logic decomposes in copy <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> operations, when we consider action models with Boolean pre-conditions and no post-condition. We also show that copy <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> operators with paths of length 1 can be ex-pressed by action models with post-conditions. We investigate the expressive power of the logic with copy <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> operations, together with the complex-ity of the satisfiability problem {{of some of its}} syntactic fragments...|$|R
5|$|Another {{lawsuit was}} filed by a South Carolina {{resident}} {{who said he}} was accosted by Baron Cohen (as Borat) in the bathroom at a restaurant in downtown Columbia, with the actor allegedly making comments regarding the individual's genitals, without signing any legal waiver. The lawsuit also sought to have the footage excluded from any DVD releases <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> from Internet video sites.|$|E
5|$|Champfleury was {{intimidated by}} her {{vitality}} and jealousy, <b>and</b> <b>removed</b> himself from her life. On his recommendation, she turned creative control of Balzac's unfinished novels Le Député d'Arcis and Les Petits Bourgeois to another writer, Charles Rabou. Rabou added extensively {{to them and}} published both books in 1854. To soothe the publisher, Hańska falsely claimed that Balzac had chosen Rabou as his literary successor.|$|E

5000|$|A {{variation}} of the Sierpinski carpet, called the Wallis sieve, starts in the same way, by subdividing the unit square into nine smaller squares <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> the middle of them.

5|$|In 2005, {{construction}} {{began on}} the third phase of the bypass, connecting the southern segment at Highway7 with the northern segment north of 16th Avenue. This four lane section opened on October24, 2006. The two lane road between this new section and 16th Avenue was subsequently closed <b>and</b> <b>removed.</b> Phase1 cost an estimated $19.3 million; phase2 an estimated $5.5 million; phase3 an estimated $10.8 million.|$|E
5|$|In May 1944, a Junkers JU188 {{was shot}} down by a Mosquito nearby and its debris was {{scattered}} across the nearby village of West Worldham, including the church wall.

40|$|The {{hygienic}} {{behavior of}} honey bees {{is based on}} a two-step process, including uncapping <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> diseased, dead, damaged, or parasitized brood inside the cell. We evaluated during periods of 1 h the time that hygienic and non-hygienic colonies of Africanized honey bees spend to detect, uncap <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> pin-killed brood using comb inserts with transparent walls placed in observation hives. We observed that hygienic colonies are significantly faster in detecting, uncapping <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> dead brood in the cells (P < 0. 001) ...|$|R

5|$|NY28B was a spur route {{connecting}} NY28 in Remsen to Prospect in Oneida County. When {{the route}} was initially assigned , it began at NY12 and NY28 in Barneveld and overlapped with then-NY287 to Prospect, from where NY28B continued northwest to NY12 and NY28 in Remsen {{by way of}} Prospect Road.
