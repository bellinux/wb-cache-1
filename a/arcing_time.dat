5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{efficient}} means to reduce <b>arcing</b> <b>time</b> is to use an arc eliminator that will extinguish the arc within a few milliseconds. The arc eliminator operates in 1-4 ms and creates a 3-phase short-circuit on {{another part of the}} system, typically upstream at higher voltages. This device contains a fast contact pin that upon activation by an external relay, makes physical contact with the energized bus which then creates the short-circuit. The arc eliminator will protect a human if they are {{standing in front of the}} arc flash event and the relays detect the arc flash by diverting the arc flash to another location, although the diversion may cause a system failure at the location the short-circuit was diverted to. These devices must be replaced after an operation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Arcing</b> <b>time</b> can {{be reduced}} by {{temporarily}} setting upstream protective devices to lower setpoints during maintenance periods, or by employing zone-selective interlocking protection (ZSIP). With zone-selective interlocking, a downstream breaker that detects a fault communicates with an upstream breaker to delay its instantaneous tripping function. In this way [...] "selectivity" [...] will be preserved, in other words faults in the circuit are cleared by the breaker nearest to the fault, minimizing {{the effect on the}} entire system. A fault on a branch circuit will be detected by all breakers upstream of the fault (closer to the source of power). The circuit breaker closest to the downstream fault will send a restraining signal to prevent upstream breakers from tripping instantaneously. The presence of the fault will nevertheless activate the preset trip delay timer(s) of the upstream circuit breaker(s); this will allow an upstream circuit breaker to interrupt the fault, if still necessary after the preset time has elapsed. The ZSIP system allows faster instantaneous trip settings to be used, without loss of selectivity. The faster trip times reduce the total energy in an arc fault discharge.|$|E

50|$|In {{electrical}} switches, including {{bimetallic strip}} based thermostats, the switch usually has hysteresis in the switching action. In these cases hysteresis is mechanically achieved via positive feedback within {{a tipping point}} mechanism. The positive feedback action minimises the length of <b>time</b> <b>arcing</b> occurs for during the switching and also holds the contacts in an open or closed state.|$|R
50|$|Many {{alternative}} solutions, {{particularly those}} based upon an AC Switch Disconnect design which use bridge contacts, have been modified and rated for DC operation. These types of product have a switching speed that is {{directly linked to}} the operator speed, therefore slow operation of the handle results in slow contact separation of the contacts which can produce <b>arcing</b> <b>times</b> of 100ms or more. Additionally in these switches, the contact surface is also the surface upon which electrical arcs tend to form; therefore any surface damage or sooting caused by arcing {{is likely to have}} a detrimental effect on the isolators contact resistance and its longevity.TRUE DC Solar Isolators use a rotary knife contact mechanism so when the unit is operated, the handle movement gives a double make/break per contact set. As DC load switching creates electrical arcing, the design is such that this only occurs on the corners of the switching parts meaning that the main contact is made on an area where no arcing has occurred. The rotary contact mechanism methodology used in TRUE DC solar isolators means that when the isolator is operated, a self-cleaning action occurs on the arcing points and contact surfaces thereby producing good high-vibration resistant contact integrity, with reduced contact resistance. This contact system ensures that power loss per pole is kept as low as possible, and consistent {{over the life of the}} product, unlike conventional style isolators where entrapment of contaminants, and then subsequent compression on lateral operation, can lead to variable and increasing contact resistance, and hence per pole losses.|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with arcing processes and related cathode phenomena for high pressure xenon short arc lamps, TIG-welding arcs and high current pulsed light sources. Especially, the mechanisms of emission and erosion at activated cathodes are considered for different arcing modes in gaseous arcs. The microscopic arcing processes at cathodes with inhomogeneously distributed ThO_ 2 -, BaO-, La_ 2 O_ 3 -, ZrO-activators and cathodes covered by Th-layers are studied {{in comparison to the}} microscopic processes at pure metal cathodes. Discharge experiments have been carried out to determine the influence of cathode properties on the arc behaviour. The composition of the cathodes and the type of activators were changed over a wide range. Further, cathodes with thorium layers produced by means of ion beam sputter deposition in the thickness range of some hundred nm were found to show improved ignition and emission behaviour and an enhanced resistance to erosion processes. The changes of the cathodes due to arcing were studied by means of surface analysis techniques such as X-ray microanalysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), secondary electron spectroscopy, SIMS and cathodoluminescence (CL) -investigations characterising the cathodes before and after arcing. The distributions of emitter oxides and the chemical composition of the cathodes after different <b>arcing</b> <b>times</b> were measured. The investigations on emission and erosion phenomena have given considerable indications of the strong dependence of arcing processes on the cathode properties in micro-areas. The results of these investigations in gaseous arcs are interpreted in comparison with corresponding arcs in vacuum and the new experimental knowledge achieved in studies on microscopic arcing processes at activated cathodes is discussed and compared to the behaviour of arc spots at pure metal cathodes.

40|$|Capacitor {{banks are}} {{installed}} in {{an increasing number}} {{in order to control}} power quality issues in the transmission and distribution networks. Due to load fluctuation, switching of capacitor banks is normally a daily operation. Although the current to be switched (e. g. the normal load current) is far below the maximum capability of circuit breakers, the transient current upon making (the so-called inrush current) {{has proven to be a}} major challenge for circuit breakers. The often very high value of (inrush) current flowing during the closing (pre-) arc between breaker contacts is potentially harmful for the contact system. The IEC circuit breaker 62271 - 100 standard specifies 20 kA peak while energizing (an) additional bank(s) to those already energized, the so-called back-to-back configuration. It will be demonstrated that three-phase energization with full inrush current cannot be reliably performed in test-circuits. Statistics will be presented on the number of (transmission, distribution) circuit breakers that were tested for this duty. The probability of a late breakdown in vacuum, after energization with inrush current, is rising with rated voltage. Absence of late breakdown of vacuum interrupters after capacitive current switching is especially challenging at higher voltage levels, and is a main barrier to develop vacuum interrupters for transmission voltages having very low probability of re-strike. It was observed that in SF 6 circuit breakers, the very intense pre-arc can damage the nozzle, whereas in vacuum circuit breakers, the inrush current arc may deteriorate the dielectric withstand of the switching gap, sometime leading to (late) breakdown after load current interruption. A new measurement method is described to monitor the field electron emission (FEE) current that flows in a pulsating manner in vacuum gaps after current interruption. This measurement system is able to deal (and measure) currents varying as wide as nine decades, from full breakdown currents of several tens of kA to FEE currents of tens of µA). Research tests in full-power test-circuits (following the IEC standard) with a number of prototype vacuum interrupters of different geometry and contact material show a very large range (from micro-amperes to milli-amperes) of current during recovery voltage after load current interruption. It was observed that the load current at longer <b>arcing</b> <b>times</b> reduces the electrical emission activity of the contact surfaces. Large inrush current increases the FEE current.

If left uncontrolled they can produce damage and cause plasma disruption by impurity influx. To {{address this issue}} an arc real time control and protection imaging system for the Joint European Torus (JET) LH antenna has been implemented. The LH system {{is one of the}} additional heating systems at JET. It comprises 24 microwave generators (klystrons, operating at 3. 7 GHz) providing up to 5 MW of heating and current drive to the JET plasma. This is done through an antenna composed of an array of waveguides facing the plasma. The protection system presented here is based primarily on an imaging arc detection and real time control system. It has adapted the ITER like wall hotspot protection system using an identical CCD camera and real time image processing unit. A filter has been installed to avoid saturation and spurious system triggers caused by ionization light. The antenna is divided in 24 Regions Of Interest (ROIs) each one corresponding to one klystron. If an arc precursor is detected in a ROI, power is reduced locally with subsequent potential damage and plasma disruption avoided. The power is subsequently reinstated if, during a defined interval of <b>time,</b> <b>arcing</b> is confirmed not to be present by image analysis.

The fault leaves a charred furrow, known as the ''arc track'', through Kapton cable insulation. Tests by NASA and others have confirmed that the average circuit current during an arc tracking fault remains below overcurrent protection trip levels. Some in the field believe the reduction of fault current is due to the carbonized insulation, presumably, acting as a resistive element in the fault branch. It is thought that insulations which do not carbonize when exposed to an arc will eliminate the arc tracking problem. This thesis supports an alternative theory that the voltage drop of the arc itself may be solely responsible for reducing the fault current and the ''track'' is collateral damage from the arc. The voltage-current (V-l) characteristic of arcs below 50 amps was left unresolved, by research concluded in the 192 O's. Recently, interest has returned to low current AC arcing, but the focus has been on the harmonics generated by such arcs as a means of detection. This thesis proposes a static V-I characteristic for a low current DC arcs supported by theory and empirical data. Two different experiments and a total of twenty four trials were made of DC arcs on bare I 8 AWG solid copper electrodes in geometries simulating Sow current arcs, between wires of a typical cable bundle (1 - 6 amps and 12 - 125 mils long). Using multiple linear regression the data was fitted to 18 different models, new or proposed in the literature. Evaluated using the F-statistic, the best model, with a standard error of less than 3 V, was a voltage source, opposed to the system voltage, dependent only on arc length. Current only influenced arc lifetime. Varc=l 3 v+l 68 v/inch*arc length This model agreed with low current (< 1 A) zero length sparks and a 55 miI, 60 amp peak AC arc. It does not agree with the high current model developed from long AC arcs: Varc= 37 v/inch*arc length.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for implementing controlled fault interruption, using high voltage, SF 6 circuit breakers on three phase high voltage power networks. The main {{goal of the}} method is to synchronize the opening or trip commands to each phase of a circuit breaker with respect to target current zero times so that each phase will interrupt with a preselected <b>arcing</b> <b>time.</b> Benefits of this approach include reduction in the electrical wear rate of the circuit breaker, {{in addition to providing}} potential to optimize existing interrupter technologies and facilitate new interruption techniques. A generic structure for controlled fault interruption algorithms is proposed, aimed at utilizing synergies with existing digital power system protection methods. The proposed method is based on estimating the future behavior of the currents in each phase, using a generic model. The parameters of the model of the currents are obtained using least mean squares regression. Novel features of the proposed method include the use of analysis-of- variance tests to validate the model for targeting instant selection, provision of algorithm failure bypass control, identification of multiphase fault types and detection of the fault inception instant. ...|$|E

Sales of MMA electrodes in the major economies represent about 46 % by weight of the total for aIl consumab les. ln terms of weld metal sales, I. e. excluding the weight of flux, MMA represents about 41 % of the total. Assuming weld metal deposition rates of 3 kg/h for MMA and 7 kg/h for MIG welding, MMA must represent about two-thirds of welding in terms of <b>arcing</b> <b>time.</b> Furthermore, as the duty cycle for MMA ffight be only about half that for semi-automatic processes, MMA welding might represent about 80 % of welders ' payroll time (Jefferson, 1988). Many types of metal are welded, including stainless-steel, high chromium armour plate, aluminium, copper and nickel; however, the large majority ofwelding is on mi Id and low alloy steels. Stainless-steel represents only about 4 - 5 % of MMA electrode sales and about 3 % of MAG and TIG wire sales in western Europe. Similady, about 2 - 3 % of MAG and TIG wire sales are aluminium...|$|E
40|$|Air-break {{disconnectors}} (DS) in a high-voltage network can interrupt small capacitive currents (e. g., occurring when disconnecting short unloaded transmission lines, current transformers, and so forth). The {{performance of}} a device with high-velocity opening auxiliary contacts attached to the DS enhancing the interrupting capability is presented. A series of laboratory experiments is carried out with the interrupted current range between 5 and 27 A. The experimental observations include voltage and current characteristics of the DS, and synchronous optical recording of the arc with a high-speed camera. Electrical and optical data are studied for fail and successful interruptions. The results show: 1) The short <b>arcing</b> <b>time</b> by the fast opening contacts limits the energy input into the arc, enhancing the probability of arc extinction; 2) the contribution to the arc energy mainly comes from the oscillations upon restrike. The energy input to the arc increases with higher breakdown voltage, larger air gap, and higher interrupted current; 3) the arc brightness is synchronous with arc current. With higher interrupted current, the overall arc is brighter and its remnants decay slower. Based on the results, potential successful approaches to increase the interruption capability are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the {{transient characteristics}} and breaking performance of direct-current (DC) forced-interruption vacuum interrupters in 270 V power-supply systems. Three stages are identified in forced interruption: the DC-arcing stage, current-commutation stage, and voltage-recovery stage. During the current-commutation stage, the reverse peak-current coefficient k, {{which is a}} key design factor, {{is used to calculate}} the rate of current at zero-crossing (di/dt). MATLAB/Simulink simulation models are established to obtain the transient characteristics influenced by the forced-commutation branch parameters and the coefficient k. To study the breaking performance of spiral-type contacts, experiments are conducted for different contact materials and arcing times for currents less than 3. 5 kA. During the DC-arcing stage, a locally intensive burning arc is observed in the CuW 80 contact; however, it is not observed in the CuCr 50 contact. On examining the re-ignition interruption results of the CuW 80 contact, the intensive burning arc is found to be positioned within a possible re-ignition region. When the <b>arcing</b> <b>time</b> is longer than 1 ms, the intensive burning arc occurs and affects the breaking performance of the spiral-type contacts. If the DC-arcing stage is prolonged, the total arcing energy increases, which leads to a lower breaking capacity...|$|E
