5|$|McKinley was a noted protectionist, and was {{confident}} of winning an election fought on that question. But it was free silver {{that became the}} issue of the day, with Bryan capturing the Democratic nomination as a foe of the gold standard. Hanna raised millions for a campaign of education with trainloads of pamphlets to convince the voters that free silver would be harmful, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> had its effect, even more were printed on protectionism. McKinley stayed at home in Canton, running a front porch campaign and reaching millions through newspaper coverage of the speeches he gave to organized groups of people. This contrasted with Bryan, who toured the nation by rail in his campaign. Supported by the well-to-do, urban dwellers, and prosperous farmers, McKinley won a majority of the popular vote and an easy victory in the Electoral College. McKinley's systemized approach to gaining the presidency laid the groundwork for modern campaigns, and he forged an electoral coalition that would keep the Republicans in power most of the time until 1932.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from their}} immense size, Chinese walls were also {{structurally}} {{different from the}} ones built in medieval Europe. Whereas European walls were {{for the most part}} constructed of stone with gravel or rubble filling and limestone mortar, Chinese walls had tamped earthen cores which absorbed the energy of artillery shots. Walls were built using constructed wooden frameworks which were then filled with layers of earth tamped down to a highly compact state, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> was completed the frameworks were removed for use in the next wall section. Starting from the Song dynasty these walls were improved with an outer layer of bricks or stone to prevent erosion, and during the Ming, earthworks were interspersed with stone and rubble. Most Chinese walls were also sloped rather than vertical to better deflect projectile energy.|$|E
500|$|Shakespeare is also {{careful to}} make the {{distinction}} that Prospero presents himself as a rational, and not an occultist, magician. He does this by providing a contrast to him in Sycorax. Sycorax {{is said to have}} worshipped the devil and been full of [...] "earthy and abhored commands". She was unable to control Ariel, who was [...] "too delicate" [...] for such dark tasks. Prospero's rational goodness enables him to control Ariel where Sycorax can only trap him in a tree. Sycorax's magic is frequently described as destructive and terrible, where Prospero's is said to be wondrous and beautiful. Prospero seeks to set things right in his world through his magic, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> is done, he renounces it, setting Ariel free.|$|E

500|$|Another {{subject of}} {{analysis}} is whether statutes restricting {{the authority of}} governors to appoint temporary replacements are constitutional. Vikram Amar, writing in the Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly, claims that Wyoming's requirement that its governor fill a senatorial vacancy by nominating a person of the same party {{as the person who}} vacated that Senate seat violates the Seventeenth Amendment. This is based on the text of the Seventeenth Amendment, which states that [...] "the legislature of any state may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments". The amendment only empowers the legislature to delegate the authority to the governor <b>and,</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> authority has been delegated, does not permit the legislature to intervene. The authority is {{to decide whether or not}} the governor shall have the power to appoint temporary senators, not in what fashion he should do so. Sanford Levinson, in his rebuttal to Amar, argues that rather than engaging in a textual interpretation, those examining the meaning of constitutional provisions should interpret them in the fashion that provides the most benefit, and that legislatures being able to restrict gubernatorial appointment authority provides a substantial benefit to the states.|$|E
2500|$|Bismarck—a Junker himself—was strong-willed, outspoken and overbearing, but {{he could}} also be polite, charming and witty. Occasionally he {{displayed}} a violent temper, and he kept his power by melodramatically threatening resignation time and again, which cowed Wilhelm I. He possessed not only a long-term national and international vision but also the short-term ability to juggle complex developments. As the leader of what historians call [...] "revolutionary conservatism", Bismarck became a hero to German nationalists; they built many monuments honoring {{the founder of the}} new Reich. Many historians praise him as a visionary who was instrumental in uniting Germany <b>and,</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> had been accomplished, kept the peace in Europe through adroit diplomacy.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, society was {{beginning}} {{to take note of}} the impact of the Pill on traditional gender roles. The Pill Versus the Springhill Mine Disaster was the title poem of a 1968 collection by Richard Brautigan, comparing [...] "the people lost inside of" [...] the poet's lover with miners buried underground. Women now did not have to choose between a relationship and a career; singer Loretta Lynn commented on this in her 1974 album with a song entitled [...] "The Pill", which told the story of a married woman's use of the drug to liberate herself from her traditional role as wife and mother. According to writer Margaret Wente, [...] "The pill decoupled sex and marriage, and it also decoupled marriage and procreation. The purpose of marriage was mutual satisfaction, not children, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> happened, gay marriage probably became inevitable." ...|$|E

During this mode, you have a 60 minute time limit, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>that's</b> up, {{the team with the}} most {{remaining}} units wins.

2500|$|Next {{came the}} auction, where the townspeople would bid on the captives {{they wanted to}} {{purchase}} <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> was over, the governor of Algiers (the Dey) {{had the chance to}} purchase any slave he wanted for the price they were sold at the auction. During the auctions the slaves would be forced to run and jump around to show their strength and stamina. After purchase, the captives would either be held for ransom, or be put to work. Slaves were used {{for a wide variety of}} jobs, from hard manual labor to housework (the job assigned to most women slaves). At night the slaves were put into prisons called 'bagnios' (derived from the Italian word [...] "bagno" [...] for public bath, inspired by the Turks' use of Roman baths at Constantinople as prisons), which were often hot and overcrowded. However, these bagnios began improving by the 18th century. Some bagnios had chapels, hospitals, shops, and bars run by captives, though such amenities remained uncommon.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} {{ending to}} the Cain novella {{called for the}} characters to commit double suicide. Suicide, however, was strictly forbidden at the time by the Hays Production Code {{as a way to}} resolve a plot, so Wilder wrote and filmed a different ending in which Neff goes to the gas chamber while Keyes watches. This scene was shot before the scenes that eventually became the film's familiar ending, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> final intimate exchange between Neff and Keyes revealed its power to Wilder, he began to wonder if the gas chamber ending was needed at all. [...] "You couldn't have a more meaningful scene between two men", Wilder said. As he would later recount, [...] "The story was between the two guys. I knew it, even though I had already filmed the gas chamber scene... So we just took out the scene in the gas chamber," [...] despite its $150,000 cost to the studio. Removal of the scene, over Chandler's objection, also removed the Hays Office's single biggest remaining objection to the picture, since they regarded it as [...] "unduly gruesome" [...] and predicted that it would never be approved by local and regional censor boards. The footage and sound elements are lost, but production stills of the scene still exist.|$|E

So saying, she turned her fine shoulders twice, once this way <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>that,</b> and went out. She had never told even Stanley her ambition that at Becket, under her aegis, should be laid the foundation-stone of the real scheme, whatever it might be, that should regenerate 'the Land.'

60|$|Ten {{days had}} gone by when once more I found myself drawing near {{to the mouth of}} the Black Kloof where dwelt Zikali the Wizard. Our journey in Zululand had been tedious and uneventful. It seemed to me that we met {{extraordinarily}} few people; it was as though the place had suddenly become depopulated, and I even passed great kraals where {{there was no one to}} be seen. I asked Nombe what was the meaning of this, for she and three silent men she had with her were acting as our guides. Once she answered that the people had moved because of lack of food, as the season had been one of great scarcity owing to drought, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>that</b> they had been summoned to a gathering at the king's kraal near Ulundi. At any rate they were not there, and the few who did appear stared at us strangely.|$|E

Well, go where you are called or as {{occasion}} drives, though you have much to keep you at home. I would that you were wed, since marriage is an anchor that few ships can drag.
