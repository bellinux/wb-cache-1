25|$|Japan {{is forced}} to import more than 767,000 tons of rice {{annually}} from the United States, Thailand, and other countries due to WTO rules, although Japan produces over 100% of domestic rice consumption needs with 11 million tons produced in 2005 while 8.7million tons were consumed in 2003–2004 period.

25|$|A {{spin-off}} {{series of}} audios, titled Dalek Empire (2001–08), is set after The Time of the Daleks and features a successful Dalek {{invasion of the}} Milky Way during an Earth Empire. The Daleks make great headway and manage to conquer their way up to Earth's solar system in a prolonged war against both humans and the Daleks of an alternate reality. They are finally defeated by a psychic attack that causes every piece of Dalek machinery to self-destruct in an ever-expanding wave which obliterates their forces and kills the Emperor. However, this also cripples civilisation of the Milky Way and sets galactic development back by a substantial amount. Centuries later, when only a handful remember the Daleks, the Dalek Empire attacks again {{under the command of}} a Dalek Supreme, which infects the borders of the galaxy with a virus that genetically re-engineers humans into Daleks. By {{the end of the third}} Dalek Empire series, the Daleks have a new giant army and <b>are</b> <b>poised</b> <b>to</b> go to war with the Galactic Federation, with the outcome uncertain.|$|E

2500|$|In 236, Sun Quan {{launched}} a campaign against Wei and he ordered Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin to lead an army to attack the Wei-controlled Xiangyang Commandery. Lu Xun sent a close aide, Han Bian (韓扁), to deliver a report to Sun Quan. On the journey back, Han Bian encountered the enemy at Mianzhong (沔中) and was captured. When Zhuge Jin received news of Han Bian's capture, he became fearful and wrote to Lu Xun: [...] "His Majesty has withdrawn his forces. The enemy has captured Han Bian and they know our situation. The rivers have dried up so we should make a hasty retreat." [...] Lu Xun did not respond, and he instructed his men to plant turnips and peas, while he played weiqi and other games with his officers as though nothing had happened. Zhuge Jin said, [...] "Boyan possesses intelligence and strategy, he knows what he's doing." [...] He came to see Lu Xun, who told him, [...] "The enemy knows that His Majesty has withdrawn his forces, so they have no worries and will concentrate their attacks on us.

2500|$|The {{opening line}} of the novel famously announces: [...] "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in {{possession}} of a good fortune must be in want of a wife." [...] This sets marriage as a central subject—and really, a central problem—for the novel generally. Readers <b>are</b> <b>poised</b> <b>to</b> question whether or not these single men are, in fact, in want of a wife, or if such desires are dictated by the [...] "neighbourhood" [...] families and their daughters who require a [...] "good fortune". Marriage is a complex social activity that takes political economy, and economy more generally, into account. In the case of Charlotte Lucas, for example, the seeming success of her marriage lies in the comfortable economy of their household, while the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Bennet serves to illustrate bad marriages based on an initial attraction and surface over substance (economic and psychological). The Bennets' marriage is one such example that the youngest Bennet, Lydia, will come to re-enact with Wickham, and the results are far from felicitous. Though the central characters, Elizabeth and Darcy, begin the novel as hostile acquaintances and unlikely friends, they eventually work [...] to understand each other and themselves so that they can marry each other on compatible terms personally, even if their [...] "equal" [...] social status remains fraught. When Elizabeth rejects Darcy's first proposal, the argument of only marrying when one is in love is introduced. Elizabeth only accepts Darcy's proposal when she is certain she loves him and her feelings are reciprocated. Austen's complex sketching of different marriages ultimately allows readers to question what forms of alliance are desirable, {{especially when it comes to}} privileging economic, sexual, companionate attraction.|$|E
