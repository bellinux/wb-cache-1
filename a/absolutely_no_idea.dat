The Japanese lost only 29 aircraft, while 74 were damaged by anti-aircraft {{fire from the}} ground. The damaged aircraft were disproportionately dive and torpedo bombers, seriously impacting available firepower to exploit the first two waves' success, so {{the commander of the}} First Air Fleet, Naval Lieutenant-General Chuichi Nagumo, withdrew. Yamamoto later lamented Nagumo's failure to seize the initiative to seek out and destroy the US carriers, absent from the harbor, or further bombard various strategically important facilities on Oahu. Nagumo had <b>absolutely</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> where the American carriers might be, and remaining on station while his forces cast about looking for them ran the risk of his own forces being found first and attacked while his aircraft were absent searching. In any case, insufficient daylight remained after recovering the aircraft from the first two waves for the carriers to launch and recover a third before dark, and Nagumo's escorting destroyers lacked the fuel capacity for him to loiter long. Much has been made of Yamamoto's hindsight, but, in keeping with Japanese military tradition not to criticize the commander on the spot, he did not punish Nagumo for his withdrawal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In a {{multi-agent system}} (MAS), {{at least one}} agent {{matchmaking}} service is required to let any agent in the system find some agents that can help it complete some part of its job. This service is normally {{in the form of}} a typical agent called matchmaking agent. In this work, Distributed Matchmaking Agent Architecture (DMAA) is proposed. It is a group of matchmaking agents that provide agent matchmaking service and exploit domain ontology to enhance the matchmaking process. It is composed of a group of three-type matchmaking agents working together: root matchmaking agents (RMMAs), authoritative matchmaking agents (AMMAs), and local matchmaking agents (LMMAs). They represent agents’ preferences and capabilities by predicate calculus sentences, and use taxonomic knowledge base to semantically match the preferences and the capabilities. The root matchmaking agent also uses the taxonomic knowledge base to perform ontological load balancing between matchmaking agents in the system so that the system workload from its matching process is reduced. This makes the system perform its task faster. communities of agents, a requester agent <b>absolutely</b> has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> which provider agent is capable of fulfilling its requests. Hence, it is important for the multi-agent system to have its own matchmaking service. Previous research [4] suggested that this service must be served by matchmaking agents, the agents that dedicate themselves to this only type of service. II. MATCHMAKING AGENT TECHNOLOGY Matchmaking agent is an agent that has duty to find another agent which has capability to provide a requester agent a set of required services. To do this, the matchmaking agent must know the names of many agents and their corresponding capabilities [5]. Fig. 1 illustrates general operation of a typical matchmaking agent.

His death came {{during the height of the}} LDS church's fight to ban same-sex marriage in California with Prop 22 also known as Knight's Initiative. Shortly before his death he wrote a 12-page letter to his cousin in which he states that when he heard the church was asking members to donate time and money in support of Prop 22 he [...] "cried for hours in [...] room" [...] and he felt that the church's positions created an environment [...] "hostile for young gay Mormons". The letter also stated [...] "straight members have <b>absolutely</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what it is like to grow up gay in this church.... It is a life of constant torment, self-hatred and internalized homophobia." [...] The same month he also wrote a letter to the editor published in the BYU newspaper pleading for the acceptance of homosexual individuals in response to a letter published five days before comparing homosexuality to pedophilia, bestiality and Satanism. Right before his death he wrote a note stating, [...] "The church has no idea that ... there are surely boys and girls on their callused hands and knees imploring God to free them of their pain. They hate themselves ... God never intended me to be straight. Hopefully, my death might be a catalyst for some good." [...] Two weeks after Stuart's death on March 9, D.J. Thompson a 33-year-old gay Mormon man in Florida completed suicide after writing a note referencing Stuart's death and stating that Proposition 22 was the [...] "last straw in my lifelong battle to see peace in the world". Three weeks after Stuart's death, another gay Mormon active in the church in California was a victim of suicide. Clay Whitmer, who had become close friends with Stuart while the two were serving an LDS mission in Italy had attempted six times over a few years before but completed suicide on the seventh time. Former LDS painter Randall Lake produced several portraits of suicide including one of his Mormon boyfriend who hung himself after being ostracized a few days after they both came out.|$|E
