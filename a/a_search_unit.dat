40|$|Abstract – In this paper, {{the problem}} of path {{planning}} for <b>a</b> ground <b>search</b> <b>unit</b> looking for <b>an</b> object of unknown location is considered. As in the classical optimal searcher path problem, the probability of finding the search object is the main criterion of optimality and the <b>search</b> <b>unit</b> is constrained by the environment topology that influences its choices for a navigable path {{as well as its}} detection capabilities. This paper proposes an extension to the classical optimal searcher path problem in discrete time and space by integrating inter-region visibility as an additional criterion. This new formulation allows a refinement in the discretization of the space in which <b>a</b> ground <b>search</b> <b>unit</b> evolves. <b>A</b> general mixed-integer programming model is proposed, and experimental results with a moving object in grid environments are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Hash {{functions}} play {{an important}} role in various cryptographic applications. Modern cryptography relies on a few but supposedly well analyzed hash functions which are mostly members of the so-called MD 4 -family. This work shows whether it is possible, using special-purpose hardware, to significantly speedup collision search for MD 4 -family hash functions. A thorough analysis of the computational requirements for MD 4 -family hash functions and corresponding collision attacks reveals that a microprocessor based architecture is best suited for the implementation of collision search algorithms. Consequently, we designed and implemented a (concerning MD 4 -family hash-functions) general-purpose microprocessor with minimal area requirements and, based on this, <b>a</b> full collision <b>search</b> <b>unit.</b> Comparing the performance characteristics of both ASICs with standard PC processors and clusters, it turns out that our design, massively parallelized, is nearly four times more cost-efficient than parallelized standard PCs. With further optimizations, we believe that this factor can even be improved. Keywords. Hash functions, Special-purpose Hardware, Crypto Attacks. ...|$|R

A specific example of this problem is hunting for an enemy submarine by naval forces. So far, this problem has not been solved, because of the difficulty of predicting the target's behaviour. In finding promising routes for the <b>search</b> <b>units,</b> <b>a</b> heuristic has been developed. To obtain these routes, at every decision moment in time an optimal point to go to must be determined. This amounts to finding at every decision moment an optimum of a function that changes over time. © 2005 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
