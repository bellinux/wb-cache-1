25|$|Originating in the 1930s, {{this myth}} {{was the basis}} for films like Reefer Madness, and used by Harry Anslinger of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics as {{justification}} for outlawing cannabis. The allegation was that even the calmest, most normal person could be transformed into a psychopathic killer or rapist solely from smoking a joint. No relationship has ever been proven linking such crimes to the <b>acute</b> <b>intoxication</b> of cannabis alone, and cannabis' psychological effects tend to be more associated with pacifism and inactivity than with aggression. For example, studies of the Jamaican working class showed no difference in the crime rates between users and the non-user of cannabis.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that alcohol {{dependence}} relates directly to cravings and irritability. Another study has shown that alcohol use is a significant predisposing factor towards antisocial behavior in children. Depression, anxiety and panic disorder are disorders commonly reported by alcohol dependent people. Alcoholism is associated with dampened activation in brain networks responsible for emotional processing (e.g. the amygdala and hippocampus). Evidence that the mental health disorders are often induced by alcohol misuse via distortion of brain neurochemistry is indicated by the improvement or disappearance of symptoms that occurs after prolonged abstinence, although problems may worsen in early withdrawal and recovery periods. Psychosis is secondary to several alcohol-related conditions including <b>acute</b> <b>intoxication</b> and withdrawal after significant exposure. Chronic alcohol misuse can cause psychotic type symptoms to develop, more so than with other drugs of abuse. Alcohol abuse {{has been shown to}} cause an 800% increased risk of psychotic disorders in men and a 300% increased risk of psychotic disorders in women which are not related to pre-existing psychiatric disorders. This is significantly higher than the increased risk of psychotic disorders seen from cannabis use making alcohol abuse a very significant cause of psychotic disorders. Approximately 3 percent of people who are alcohol dependent experience psychosis during <b>acute</b> <b>intoxication</b> or withdrawal. Alcohol-related psychosis may manifest itself through a kindling mechanism. The mechanism of alcohol-related psychosis is due to distortions to neuronal membranes, gene expression, as well as thiamin deficiency. It is possible in some cases that alcohol abuse via a kindling mechanism can cause the development of a chronic substance-induced psychotic disorder, i.e. schizophrenia. The effects of an alcohol-related psychosis include an increased risk of depression and suicide as well as psychosocial impairments. However, moderate wine drinking has been shown to lower the risk for depression.|$|E
25|$|Binge {{drinking}} {{is associated with}} increased impulsivity, impairments in spatial working memory and impaired emotional learning.

The effects on the brain are similar to those seen in alcoholics who have been detoxified multiple times but not as severe as in alcoholics who have no history of prior detox. Thus the acute withdrawal syndrome appears {{to be the most important}} factor in causing damage or impairment to brain function.

40|$|Context. <b>Acute</b> <b>intoxications</b> are {{frequently}} seen in Dutch hospitals. Based on single-centre {{studies and the}} fact that there are no clear guidelines, we hypothesised that hospital admission of <b>acute</b> <b>intoxications</b> may vary. Furthermore, decontamination treatment of poisonings may differ between hospitals, as earlier studies showed that adherence to international guidelines concerning decontamination may be poor. Objective. We aim to identify possible variations in Dutch hospital admission and decontamination treatment of patients with <b>acute</b> <b>intoxications.</b> Materials and methods. Data on <b>acute</b> <b>intoxications</b> was retrospectively collected from patient records from the emergency departments of six Dutch hospitals. All patients older than 14 years who presented between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2008 were included in the study. Results. The percentage of suicide attempts differed signifi cantly between the hospitals (25 – 73 %, p 0. 0001) as equally the percentage of intoxications with drugs of abuse (18 – 61 %, p 0. 0001). Marked differences in admission rates were found (27 – 78 %, p 0. 0001) and these differences remained even when intoxications because of suicide attempts and drugs of abuse were analysed separately (admission rate of 52 – 87 %, p 0. 0001 and 8 – 71 %, p 0. 0001 respectively). Reported consultation with the National Poisons Information Centre differed between hospitals (range 0 % to 80 – 100 %).

2500|$|Parathion is a cholinesterase inhibitor. It {{generally}} {{disrupts the}} nervous system by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase. It is absorbed via skin, mucous membranes, and orally. Absorbed parathion is rapidly metabolized to paraoxon, as described in Insecticidal activity. Paraoxon exposure can result in headaches, convulsions, poor vision, vomiting, abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, unconsciousness, tremor, dyspnea, and finally lung-edema as well as respiratory arrest. [...] Symptoms of poisoning are known to last for extended periods, sometimes months. The most common and very specific antidote is atropine, in doses of up to 100mg daily. Because atropine may also be toxic, {{it is recommended that}} small frequently repeated doses be used in treatment. If human poisoning is detected early and the treatment is prompt (atropine and artificial respiration), fatalities are infrequent. Insufficient oxygen will lead to cerebral hypoxia and permanent brain damage. [...] Peripheral neuropathy including paralysis is noticed as late sequelae after recovery from <b>acute</b> <b>intoxication.</b> Parathion and related organophosphorus pesticides are used in hundreds of thousands of poisonings annually, especially suicides. It is known as [...] "Schwiegermuttergift" [...] (mother-in-law poison) in Germany. For this reason, most formulations contain a blue dye providing warning.|$|E

Due to its saturation (zero-order) pharmacokinetics, phenytoin carries a special risk of dose-related toxicity {{that is an}} important issue in emergency medicine. The purpose of this cross-sectional case-series study was to investigate the causes, symptoms, misdiagnoses, and outcomes of <b>acute</b> phenytoin <b>intoxication.</b> It was based on a retrospective chart review of 30 inpatients (mean age, 41. 6 ± 22. 8 years) with 36 episodes of <b>acute</b> phenytoin <b>intoxication</b> at our university hospital in the past 13 years. The average initial serum phenytoin level was 47. 3 ± 9. 7 μg/mL (range, 27. 9 - 70. 4 μg/mL). Excessive self-medication, misunderstanding of the prescription order, and probable drug interaction were the three leading causes of <b>acute</b> phenytoin <b>intoxication.</b> Unsteady gait, dizziness/vertigo, nausea/vomiting, general weakness, and drowsiness were the most common presenting symptoms. The tentative diagnostic accuracy was 67 %. The most common initial misdiagnosis was brainstem or cerebellum stroke (14 %). The clinical course in all patients was uneventful under temporary withdrawal of phenytoin and supportive care. We concluded that <b>acute</b> phenytoin <b>intoxication</b> was relatively under-diagnosed in the emergency service. Although <b>acute</b> phenytoin <b>intoxication</b> causes no mortality and has a good outcome, the unsteady gait increases the risk of injuries caused by falls.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Acute</b> <b>intoxications</b> with {{corrosive}} substances {{can cause}} severe chemical injuries {{of the upper}} gastrointestinal tract, most often located in the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach and duodenum. If a patient survives the <b>acute</b> phase of <b>intoxication,</b> regenerative response may result in esophageal and/or gastric stenosis, and increased risk of esophageal and gastric cancer. Such intoxication may be fatal due to perforation or tracheal necrosis. Enteral nutrition is a nutritional method when nutritional substances are administered through specially designed tubing placed through the nose or percutaneously, directly into the GIT. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} is to describe the methods of artificial nutrition in patients with <b>acute</b> corrosive <b>intoxications</b> and the importance of nutritional support in the treatment of these intoxications. Discussion: Nutrition in the treatment of <b>acute</b> corrosive <b>intoxications</b> is one of the most important therapeutic processes that largely contribute to faster recovery of the post-corrosive injuries of upper GIT, stabilization of biologic, immunologic and metabolic parameters, and reduction of length of stay in hospital Aim of the treatment of <b>acute</b> corrosive <b>intoxications</b> is to prevent perforation and progressive fibrosis, and esophageal and gastric stenosis. There are different and often conflicting positions, on the conservative treatment of <b>acute</b> corrosive <b>intoxications</b> in adults. Such treatment mainly consists of anti-secretory treatment, antibiotics and intensive hyper-alimentation, aiming to prevent late post-corrosive intoxications.

[...] Binge drinking is also {{associated with an increased}} risk of unplanned sex, unprotected sex, unplanned pregnancies, and an increased risk of HIV infection. 10 percent of women and 19 percent of men have reported being assaulted as a result of alcohol. Males who drink more than 35 units of alcohol per week report being physically hurt as a result of alcohol, and 15 percent report physically hurting others {{as a result of their}} drinking. Almost 16 percent of binge drinkers report being taken advantage of sexually, and 8 percent report taking advantage of another person sexually as a result of alcohol within a 1-year period. Heavy drinkers cause approximately 183,000 rapes and sexual assaults, 197,000 robberies, 661,000 aggravated assaults, and 1.7 million simple assaults each year. Binge drinking has been associated with high odds of divorce, spousal abuse, and poor job performance. Binge drinking can cause adverse effects on the body including effects on blood homeostasis and its circadian variation, cardiac rhythm, ischaemic heart disease, blood pressure, white blood cell activity, female reproductive hormone levels as well as adverse effects on the fetus. There is also evidence from animal studies that {{binge drinking}} causes brain damage. Binge drinking has been associated with lower abdominal pain in women. Ketoacidosis can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of binge drinking. Alcohol affects brain development quite significantly especially during adolescence when the brain is still developing. The main lobes that are involved in decision making and complex thought processes are undergoing their final development phase during adolescence and binge drinking can negatively stunt the growth of these frontal lobes.|$|E
