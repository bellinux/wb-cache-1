In recent years, reconciliation has evolved as a potential approach to address First Nations-Canada conflicts. However, there has been no comprehensive study of what reconciliation means or entails. This thesis suggests the heart of reconciliation is essentially a parallel process of personal and political transformation from systems of domination to relationships of mutuality. It also suggests four guiding touchstones to create conditions for reconciliation: drawing on the hdarnental worldviews of the parties themselves, transcending the victim-offender cycle, engaging in large-scale social change, and assessing appropriate timing and tactics. As a relatively new field, reconciliation calls for a research design which stresses the importance of <b>aligning</b> <b>methodology</b> <b>with</b> a given research topic as a way to produce what Patty Lather has called "emancipatory knowledge. " Consequently, the four guiding touchstones became the methodology. As this thesis explores in greater detail the role worldviews play in creating conditions for meaningful reconciliation it emphasizes the important connections between the role worldviews play in human survival, the global loss of meaning, and violence today. Three main worldviewing skill sets are then described in fuller detail: 1) connecting parties to their fundamental worldview; 2) learning to engage across worldview difference, 3) regener tin Indigenous cultures and re-civilising Western cultures. ...|$|R

Globalization {{has resulted in}} the gradual introduction of various automation systems at various levels of the business enterprise, specifically focussed on capturing essential business activities across the entity. These systems, {{inclusive of}} Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) and Plant systems has been adopted by larger corporates in executing and optimizing business functions. These large multinationals are described as complex entities with complex business structures inclusive of business processes. The quantification of automation, escalations and critical variables of these business processes has not been effectively conducted. A “systems thinking” approach adds the complexity of integrating all enterprise functions but creates a framework for evaluating the limitations and synergies so as to optimize these processes. This research focuses on the development and configuration of a simulation model for modelling enterprise maturity via business processes. This research approach includes hierarchical layout and segregation of these business processes, exploring these enterprise operations adopting business process tools, techniques, and <b>methodologies</b> <b>aligned</b> <b>with</b> a system thinking approach.

40|$|Background: In 2009, 48 % {{of males}} aged 15 or over in Mongolia {{consumed}} tobacco, placing Mongolia among the countries {{with the highest}} prevalence of male smokers in the world. Importantly, tobacco use {{is one of the}} four major risk factors contributing to the global burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) – the leading cause of mortality in Mongolia. However, the knowledge, attitudes and practices of the Mongolian population with regards to smoking are largely unmeasured. In this context, a national NCDs knowledge, attitudes and practices survey focusing, among other things, on NCD risk factors was implemented in Mongolia in late 2010 to complement the previous WHO STEPwise approach to Surveillance Survey (STEPS) findings from 2009. This publication explores the smoking-related findings of the Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices Survey (KAPS). Methods: A nationally representative sample size was calculated using <b>methodologies</b> <b>aligned</b> <b>with</b> the WHO STEPS surveys. As a result, 3450 people from across Mongolia were selected using a multi-stage, random cluster sampling method from permanent residents aged between 15 and 64 years. The KAP survey questionnaire was interviewer-administered on a door-to-door basis. Results: In Mongolia at 2010, 46. 3 % of males and 6. 8 % of females were smokers. This practice was especially dominant among males and urban dwellers (MOR 2. 2), and more so among the middle-aged (45 – 54) (MOR 2. 1) while still displaying a high prevalence among Mongolian youth (15. 5 %). The probability of smoking was independent of the level o...|$|R
30|$|The Bangkok Declaration and the SFDRR {{outline the}} common priorities, such as {{rigorous}} DRR research, collaborative platforms for DRR, investment in risk research, {{and promotion of}} dialogues between policy planners, decision-makers, and scientific and the technological communities. The issues identified in SFDRR stress advanced and affordable early warning, involve {{the private sector in}} disaster research, and share nonstrategic data among the member countries; all of these concerns are in line with the Bangkok Declaration. Purely on technical grounds, the proposal for updating the UNISDR (2009) terminology on DRR is praiseworthy. The challenge of the SFDRR, however, is found in the need to establish baseline data, mainly soft quantitative data that is supported by background analysis of a particular situation or a region and to overcome the absence of qualitative and quantitative targets for achievements. A follow-up AMCDRR in India will probably encompass strategies for implementation of the WCDRRs’ priorities of actions. This view was echoed in the suggestions made by various countries to include “substantial” at the beginning of relevant targets to reflect a stronger qualitative option, while other countries proposed quantitative targets at the national level and qualitative targets for global achievements. Baseline data are important for damage and loss assessment, and a longer time range of data is needed in order to reveal meaningful trends, and <b>align</b> <b>with</b> <b>methodologies</b> that measure progress. The commitments made by the science and technology stakeholder group in the third WCDRR lack robustness and, unfortunately, are not accompanied with measurable targets. In contrast, stakeholder commitments made in the 6 th AMCDRR are time-bound and target-based.|$|R
40|$|A major {{challenge}} in science {{education is to}} <b>align</b> the teaching <b>methodology</b> <b>with</b> the aptitudes and experiences of the students. Teenagers are used to learning {{in front of a}} computer screen even if at times they are unaware that learning is taking place. They jump from one topic to another by following links to related material rather than traditional book learning where the student starts at the beginning and finishes at the end. According to Prensky (2001), they learn in parallel rather than sequentially and are 'native speakers' of the digital language of computers. As teachers, we need to embrace new learning methodologies to meet the ever-widening gap between how we were taught and how students now learn. In this paper I analyse the effect of introducing a classroom blog to a group of 13 to 15 year old boys. I look at how participation in this blog affects the way in which students participate in science, how they perform in science examinations and whether or not this has an effect on their enjoyment of science. Participants in the study demonstrate increased levels of attentiveness and participation in class compared with a control group. They also display an increased tendency to study science outside of class time. I present statistical evidence that the process of blogging is of significant benefit to students who may have struggled considerably with science concepts in the past. I look at some of the effects on classroom dynamics and show that there are a number of factors that influence the level and quality of student participation in a blog, not least of which is the exposure their work receives compared with class work they have done in the past...|$|R

40|$|Repeated {{measures}} data {{refers to}} data sets in which observations are taken on each subject at multiple time points {{over a period}} of interest. In contrast to the analysis of independent data, repeated measures analysis must account for dependencies between observations on the same subject. With respect to count data, the term overdispersed refers to data that violates the mean-variance equality of a Poisson distribution. While the analysis of data exhibiting either one of these two properties has been described extensively, methods for analyzing data exhibiting both properties are less well-understood. ^ The archetypal data set exhibiting these two properties is the so-called 2 ̆ 2 seizure data set. 2 ̆ 2 Many approaches to analyzing these data appear in the literature. The classes of models suggested range from fully parametric conditional models to semi-parametric marginal (or GEE-type) models. The natural question is: 2 ̆ 2 which, if any, of these methods should we use? 2 ̆ 2 Outside asymptotic theory, answering this question requires simulated data. Thus, study of the processes that plausibly give rise to such data is a crucial first step. ^ Probability processes for repeated measures data can generally be classified as observation driven or latent process approaches. Because probability processes for overdispersed count data inherently involve latent variables, the latter is more amenable to producing overdispersed repeated measures count data. Latent processes for producing overdispersed count data include Poisson processes conditioned on multivariate Gaussian variables and Poisson processes conditioned on multivariate gamma variables. The advantage of utilizing the former is the wide variety of multivariate Gaussian distributions available, while use of the latter <b>aligns</b> <b>with</b> <b>methodology</b> for producing independent, overdispersed count data. This thesis expands on multivariate gamma distributions, and examines the use of these distributions for producing overdispersed repeated measures count data. ^ Characterization of the probability processes provides a basis for simulating overdispersed repeated measures count data. The relative merits of each class of models are explored via a simulation studying comparing their small-sample behavior under each of the previously described probability processes. ...|$|R

The cost of the equipment, labor, and materials to prevent and manage product defects {{is referred to as}} Dell's Cost Of Quality (COQ). A large percentage of Dell's COQ is spent by warranty-support and customer service organizations (Services). While the costs of defects most directly affects Dell through the expenditures in such Service organizations, the causes of are found predominantly in other organizations, such as Design, Materials, and Manufacturing. Without a causal link which directly ties the costs of quality defects to the causes of quality defects, it is difficult to justify increased quality-improvement expenditures in product design, product validation, component selection, or manufacturing processes. The Cost Of Quality methodology described here is a practical approach to a) quantifying the financial impact of quality defects, b) shifting the problem-solving focus from "find-and-fix" to prevention, and c) prioritizing quality improvement investments based on expected financial return.
