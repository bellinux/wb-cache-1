5|$|Lynch's {{original}} {{rough cut}} ran for approximately four hours. He was contractually obligated {{to deliver a}} two-hour movie by De Laurentiis and cut many small subplots and character scenes. He also made cuts {{at the request of}} the MPAA. For example, when Frank slaps Dorothy after the first rape scene, the audience was supposed to see Frank actually hitting her. Instead, the film cuts away to Jeffrey in the closet, wincing at what he has just seen. This cut was made to satisfy the MPAA's concerns <b>about</b> <b>violence.</b> Lynch thought that the change only made the scene more disturbing. In 2011, Lynch announced that footage from the deleted scenes, long thought lost, had been discovered. The material was subsequently included on the Blu-ray disc release of the film. The final cut of the film runs at just over two hours.|$|E
5|$|Women's role in Pre-colonial social {{structures}} reveals that feminism was theorised differently in India {{than in the}} West. In India, women's issues first began to be addressed when the state commissioned {{a report on the}} status of women to a group of feminist researchers and activists. The report recognised the fact that in India, women were oppressed under a system of structural hierarchies and injustices. During this period, Indian feminists were influenced by the Western debates being conducted <b>about</b> <b>violence</b> against women. However, due to the difference in the historical and social culture of India, the debate in favour of Indian women had to be conducted creatively and certain Western ideas had to be rejected. Women's issues began to gain an international prominence when the decade of 1975–1985 was declared the United Nations Decade for Women.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of The Legend of Boggy Creek, Pierce was {{encouraged}} to film a sequel, but resisted {{because he wanted to}} prove himself as a filmmaker rather than duplicate the same idea. He continued to make inexpensive regional films set in the southern United States, primarily targeting small-town and rural audiences. His family said Pierce liked to be continuously working and would start a new film immediately after finishing the last. His sophomore effort was Bootleggers (1974), a period action-comedy film about rival families making moonshine in the Ozark Mountains. It featured Slim Pickens and the first major performance of Jaclyn Smith, who went on to play Kelly Garrett in the television series Charlie's Angels. Pierce followed that film up with two Westerns released in 1976. The first, Winterhawk, was <b>about</b> <b>violence</b> erupting between Blackfoot Native Americans and white villagers. The film proved difficult for Pierce to shoot due to challenges from the weather and problems with the horses on the set. However, according to Pierce, Winterhawk was more widely seen than The Legend of Boggy Creek. His second Western was Winds of Autumn. Pierce co-wrote both films with his Boggy Creek partner, Earl E. Smith. Pierce made a trademark of casting his friends in his films, and Pierce himself performed minor roles in both Winterhawk and Winds of Autumn. During this period, Pierce continued working as a set decorator for films such as Black Belt Jones (1974).|$|E

25|$|Though {{the film}} had several {{high-profile}} male filmmakers interested in directing, the producers {{opted for a}} female director, hoping to avoid public outcry regarding the depictions of violence against women. Despite signing Harron to the project, the film was mired in controversy before production began, {{due in large part}} to the legacy of the book's release. As Harron began production, the crew had to contend with threats of protest, as the issue of violence in the media became crystallized by the Columbine shootings. Campaigns against the film continued throughout production, the Feminist Majority Foundation condemning the film as misogynist, and the Canadians Concerned <b>About</b> <b>Violence</b> in Entertainment (C-CAVE) convincing restaurant owners to deny Harron permission to film in their establishments.|$|E
25|$|If two {{individuals}} desire the same thing, there {{will soon be}} a third, then a fourth. This process quickly snowballs. Since from the beginning desire is aroused by the other (and not by the object) the object is soon forgotten and the mimetic conflict transforms into a general antagonism. At {{this stage of the}} crisis the antagonists will no longer imitate each other's desires for an object, but each other's antagonism. They wanted to share the same object, but now they want to destroy the same enemy. So, a paroxysm of violence would tend to focus on an arbitrary victim and a unanimous antipathy would, mimetically, grow against him. The brutal elimination of the victim would reduce the appetite for violence that possessed everyone a moment before, and leaves the group suddenly appeased and calm. The victim lies before the group, appearing simultaneously as the origin of the crisis and as the one responsible for this miracle of renewed peace. He becomes sacred, that is to say the bearer of the prodigious power of defusing the crisis and bringing peace back. Girard believes this to be the genesis of archaic religion, of ritual sacrifice as the repetition of the original event, of myth as an account of this event, of the taboos that forbid access to all the objects at the origin of the rivalries that degenerated into this absolutely traumatizing crisis. This religious elaboration takes place gradually {{over the course of the}} repetition of the mimetic crises whose resolution brings only a temporary peace. The elaboration of the rites and of the taboos constitutes a kind of empirical knowledge <b>about</b> <b>violence.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} also been noted by scholar Philip Simpson as {{highlighting}} [...] "the divide between the underprivileged and privileged classes," [...] {{as well as for}} its inversion of commonly-held beliefs <b>about</b> <b>violence</b> in urban areas and pastoral ethics: [...] "The Strangers, as many horror films do... undermines the conventional notion of rural society as a simpler, crime-free place. One might call the narrative sensibility informing The Strangers 'pastoral paranoia', in that danger lurks among the rough folk of the country rather than the suburbs and cities. Of course, it may be that provincial violence is a result of contamination, or in other words that the kind of stranger-upon-stranger violence typically associated with urban life metastasizes to the rural, a phenomenon noted by Louis Wirth." ...|$|E

A mother of four, Aldridge was pronounced dead at the hospital. The child in the stroller was not hurt.

500|$|During {{press for}} the popular 2015 film Straight Outta Compton, {{questions}} about the portrayal and behavior of Dr. Dre and other prominent figures in the rap community <b>about</b> <b>violence</b> against women – and the question about its absence in the film – were raised. The discussion about the film led to Dr. Dre addressing his past behavior in the press. In August 2015, {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone, Dre lamented his abusive past, saying, [...] "I made some fucking horrible mistakes in my life. I was young, fucking stupid. I would say all the allegations aren't true—some of them are. Those {{are some of the things}} that I would like to take back. It was really fucked up.

500|$|Zaillian {{discussed}} many of {{the themes}} in Larsson's Millennium series with Fincher, taking the pair deeper into the novel's darker subjects, such as the psychological dissimilarities between rapists and murderers. Fincher {{was familiar with the}} concept, from projects such as Seven (1995) and Zodiac (2007). Zaillian commented, [...] "A rapist, or at least our rapist, is about exercising his power over somebody. A serial killer is about destruction; they get off on destroying something. It's not about having power over something, it's about eliminating it. What thrills them is slightly different." [...] The duo wanted to expose the novels' pivotal themes, particularly misogyny. [...] "We were committed to the tack that this is a movie <b>about</b> <b>violence</b> against women about specific kinds of degradation, and you can't shy away from that. But {{at the same time you}} have to walk a razor thin line so that the audience can viscerally feel the need for revenge but also see the power of the ideas being expressed." [...] Instead of the typical three-act structure, they reluctantly chose a five-act structure, which Fincher pointed out is [...] "very similar to a lot of TV cop dramas." ...|$|E

500|$|Because of its {{depiction}} of teenage violence, A Clockwork Orange {{became one of}} the most controversial films of the decade, and part of an ongoing debate <b>about</b> <b>violence</b> and its glorification in cinema. It received an X-rated certificate upon release, just before Christmas in 1971, though many critics saw much of the violence depicted in the film as satirical, and less violent than Straw Dogs, which had been released a month earlier. Kubrick personally pulled the film from release in the United Kingdom after receiving death threats following a series of copycat crimes based on the film; it was thus completely unavailable legally in the UK until after Kubrick's death, and not re-released until 2000. John Trevelyan, the censor of the film, personally considered A Clockwork Orange to be [...] "perhaps the most brilliant piece of cinematic art I've ever seen, and believed it to present an [...] "intellectual argument rather than a sadistic spectacle" [...] in its {{depiction of}} violence, but acknowledged that many would not agree. Negative media hype over the film notwithstanding, A Clockwork Orange received four Academy Award nominations, for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Editing, and was named by the New York Film Critics Circle as the Best Film of 1971. After William Friedkin won Best Director for The French Connection that year, he told the press: [...] "Speaking personally, I think Stanley Kubrick is the best American film-maker of the year. In fact, not just this year, but the best, period".|$|E
500|$|Hemingway scholar Wendolyn Tetlow {{says that}} from its {{inception}} the collection was written with a rhythmic and lyrical unity reminiscent of Pound's [...] "Hugh Selwyn Mauberley" [...] and T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land. The carefully crafted sequence continues in the 1925 edition, beginning with the first five Nick Adams stories, which are <b>about</b> <b>violence</b> and doom, empty relationships and characters lacking self-awareness. The first two stories, [...] "Indian Camp" [...] and [...] "The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife", {{can be read as}} an exercise in counterpoint, where feelings of loss, anger, and evil are ignored and repressed. [...] "The End of Something" [...] and [...] "The Three-Day Blow" [...] also form a pair; in the first Nick breaks up with his girlfriend, in the second he gets drunk and denies the relationship has ended, convincing himself that it will all work out. This state of denial continues in [...] "The Battler", the fifth story; when faced with violence Nick will not recognize that he is in danger. [...] "A Very Short Story", about betrayal, and wounding, ends the sequence according to Tetlow, who suggests these are stories in which Hemingway writes about the [...] "most bitter feelings of loss and disillusionment". The characters face loss with inner strength, stoicism and a sense of acceptance; they build strength in the stories that come after, gaining self-awareness as they accept the futility and pain of life. The collection ends with [...] "Big Two-Hearted River", in which Nick finds tranquility, perhaps even happiness, in solitude. Wagner-Martin notes that [...] "it is this essential tranquility that in retrospect heightens the tension and sorrow of the preceding pieces." ...|$|E
