40|$|Ethnographic, historical, archaeological and {{experimental}} work suggests {{the existence of}} two basic clusters of ritual dynamics or 'modes of religiosity' - a low-frequency, high-arousal cluster linked {{to the formation of}} small cohesive communities (imaginistic mode) and high-frequency, low-arousal cluster associated with larger, more centralized social morphology (doctrinal mode). Currently, however, we lack a large-scale survey of ritual variation on which to test such predictions. Here, we compile data on 645 religious rituals from 74 cultures around the globe, extracted from the Human Relations Area Files, revealing that the cultural morphospace of ritual form favours rituals that are indeed either low-frequency and highly dysphorically <b>arouding</b> or high-frequency with lower arousal and that these ritual dynamics are linked to group size and structure. These data also suggest that low dysphoric arousal, high-frequency rituals may have been tied to the advent of agriculture and subsequent emergence of the first large-scale civilizations.

The organ was used primarily for motion pictures until 1973. Because of the cost of paying orchestra members, most accompanying orchestras were replaced with unit orchestras.|$|E

[...] Meanwhile, as railroad construction approached the area, a riverside landowner decided to plat a town {{in the southern part}} of the county in 1854, and a Cincinnati company platted another town nearby in the following year; these two locations, Mound City and Emporium City, merged under the former name in 1857. Mound City's location kept it busy during the Civil War, as a Union Navy base for gunboat maintenance was built on the shoreline and a large naval hospital operated in a former warehouse. In 1865, even before the military bases had been decommissioned, the General Assembly voted to allow Pulaski County residents a plebiscite on the location of the county seat; the vote was held in 1866, and following a two-year court battle that nearly culminated in a county seat war, the result was finally decided in favor of Mound City in 1868.|$|E

One of {{difficulties}} in super long tunnels ’ construction is the construction ventilation {{to meet the}} requirement of normal construction environment and assure the workers ’ health. Using traditional tunnelling ventilation {{is very difficult to}} meet the need of super long tunnel construction. As the energy assumption is high and it is very expensive.

It is found that the best layout of the jet fan is <b>aroud</b> the transverse channel under the direction of airflow and jet fan should not be too far away from the transverse channel.

40|$|In this paper, the {{characteristics}} of air change rate, flow and pressure fields in and <b>aroud</b> building models with wind-induced ventilation are studied using wind tunnel experiment. The results are as follows. 1. The airflow through an open window into the room model still preserves {{a large part of}} its mean kinetic energy when it remains inside the room. A major part of its preserved energy is directly convected outside the room model through a leeward window without interior dissipation. 2. Therefore {{the characteristics}} of cross ventilation are completely different from those of air infiltration. It is reflected as the decreases of values of ζ in the case of cross ventilation, compared to those values in the case of air infiltration. 3. Power balance model, which is deduced from the 3 -D conservation law of kinetic energy, well explains these situation. 4. Lost powers and total pressure loss coefficients, ζ, at various openings are examined by applying the power balance model to the experimental cases. The predicted values of ζ show reasonable results and the usefulness of the power balance model is validated...|$|E
