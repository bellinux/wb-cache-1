Currently, the flight scheduling process <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Test</b> Pilot School is performed manually. In addition, due to the large quantity of data that must be processed to develop a flight schedule for an entire week, flight schedules <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Test</b> Pilot School are developed on a daily basis.
