The troops, who had already been well trained members of airborne units before joining the company, quickly gained cohesion and were exceptional soldiers. Bond also contended that the Rangers did not properly receive credit for their actions in Korea, noting the company did not receive the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation or the U.S. Presidential Unit Citation even though units {{to which they were}} attached were decorated. Bond also said many of the <b>accomplishments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company were attributed to white units, {{due in part to the}} command climate precipitated by Almond.|$|E
5|$|The British {{government}} had traditionally {{paid little attention}} to the poor, but {{in the wake of the}} Industrial Revolution attitudes towards the <b>accomplishments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower classes were changing. The growth of the railways, the mechanisation of agriculture and the need for labour in the new inner-city factories had broken the traditional feudal economy and caused the rapid growth of cities, while increasing literacy rates led to a greater interest in the media and current affairs among ordinary workers. In 1856 the first military honour for bravery open to all ranks, the Victoria Cross, had been instituted, while in 1866 the Albert Medal, the first official honour open to civilians of all classes, was introduced. Additionally, a number of private and charitable organisations dedicated to lifesaving, most prominently the Royal Humane Society (1776) and Royal National Lifeboat Institution (1824), were increasing in activity and prominence, and gave awards and medals as a means of publicising their activities and lifesaving advice.|$|E

5|$|In {{the midst}} of the primary campaign, the 2007 General Assembly convened. Among the <b>accomplishments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> session were raising the state's minimum wage to $7.25 per hour, {{increasing}} the speed limit on major state highways to , and implementing new safety requirements for social workers and coal miners. Additional legislation stalled after negotiations over how to make the state's retirement system solvent reached an impasse. Fletcher indicated that he would consider calling the Assembly into special session later in the year. In July, Fletcher called the session and included 67 items on its agenda. Democrats in the state House of Representatives maintained that none of the items were urgent enough to warrant a special session. They claimed the call was an attempt by Fletcher to boost his sagging poll numbers against Beshear, and the House adjourned after only 90 minutes without acting on any of Fletcher's agenda. Fletcher denied the claims and insisted that a tax incentive program was needed immediately to keep the state in the running for a proposed coal gasification plant to be built by Peabody Energy. After negotiating with legislators, Fletcher called another session for August; the session included only the tax incentive program, which the Assembly passed.|$|E
5|$|The prompt <b>accomplishments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Allied Translator and Interpreter Section and Mashbir's {{executive}} ability {{resulted in}} Mashbir being promoted to full colonel by General Douglas MacArthur after only one month. Mashbir then joined {{the forefront of}} MacArthur's intelligence activities and Japanese surrender negotiations, remaining the Commandant of ATIS until December 1945. He was made famous {{at the time in}} the motion picture and still photograph of the preliminary surrender negotiations at Manila, as the man who pushed the ink-well, indicating that General Richard K. Sutherland should correct the Japanese Instrument of Surrender; and also as the man who thumbed the Japanese Lieutenant General Torashirō Kawabe along as he attempted to shake hands. The second incident provoked some mixed feelings, including sentiment that it could have damaged surrender talks. Mashbir also played a critical role retrieving and translating the Z Plan and in organizing the final surrender of Japan. In his autobiography, Mashbir explained that he was not permitted to shake hands, and {{that it would have been}} rude to point, which ultimately lead to the awkward thumbing motion that was photographed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} <b>the</b> first <b>accomplishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Timeof-Flight (ToF) {{measurement principle}} via endoscope optics. <b>The</b> applicability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approach is verified by in-vitro experiments. Off-the-shelf ToF camera sensors enable the per-pixel, on-chip, real-time, marker-less acquisition <b>of</b> distance information. <b>The</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emerging ToF measurement technique to endoscope optics {{is the basis}} {{for a new generation of}} ToF rigid or flexible 3 -D endoscopes. No modification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> endoscope optic itself is necessary as only an enhancement of illumination unit and image sensors is necessary. <b>The</b> major contribution <b>of</b> this paper is threefold: First, <b>the</b> <b>accomplishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ToF measurement principle via endoscope optics; second, the development and validation of a complete calibration and post-processing routine; third, <b>accomplishment</b> <b>of</b> extensive in-vitro experiments.
