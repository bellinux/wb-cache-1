5|$|Growth hormone {{deficiency}} {{is almost}} certain if all other pituitary tests are also abnormal, and {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1) levels are decreased. If this is not the case, IGF-1 levels are poorly predictive of the presence of GH deficiency; stimulation testing with the insulin tolerance test is then required. This is performed by administering insulin to lower the blood sugar to a level below 2.2mmol/l. Once this occurs, growth hormone levels are measured. If they are low despite the stimulatory effect of the low blood sugars, growth hormone deficiency is confirmed. The test is not without risks, especially in those prone to seizures or are known to have heart disease, and causes the unpleasant symptoms of hypoglycemia. <b>Alternative</b> <b>tests</b> (such as the growth hormone releasing hormone stimulation test) are less useful, although a stimulation test with arginine may be used for diagnosis, especially in situations where an insulin tolerance test is thought to be too dangerous. If GH deficiency is suspected, and all other pituitary hormones are normal, two different stimulation tests are needed for confirmation.|$|E

However, he maintained {{that he could}} still be an independent voice within the administration, and claimed, [...] "I happen {{to agree with the}} outcomes because I'm in the mix of making determinations of our policy decisions." [...] In addition to Act 72, Zahorchak supported a Rendell proposal to require superintendents and principals in struggling school districts to improve math and reading test scores in order to keep their jobs, an idea that was not embraced by the Pennsylvania Legislature. In 2006, Zahorchak said he supported requiring high-school students to pass exit exams before they could graduate, although he acknowledged implementing such a testing program would be a long and difficult effort. At the time, the state required students to demonstrate proficiency in math and reading before they could graduate, but allowed local districts to decide whether that should entail passing the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment math and reading tests or <b>alternative</b> <b>tests</b> in the subjects. Zahorchak said, [...] "I think it's a real disservice to graduate a student who's fundamentally not at the standard level." [...] However, Zahorchak also said students should be given alternative ways to demonstrate they are ready for college or the work force besides exams.|$|E

The quality of these test measures must be evaluated at the design stage, before the actual production, in order to select the most appropriate ones. The estimation of test metrics is complicated by the multidimensional nature of the problem, including multiple circuit performances that a device under test must verify in order to comply with the specifications, and multiple <b>alternative</b> <b>test</b> measures that are proposed as lower cost replacements. In this paper, we present a technique {{to reduce the number of}} circuit performances and test measures (jointly called output parameters) for the estimation of test metrics.
