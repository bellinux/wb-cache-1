It {{was released}} for Microsoft Windows in North America on September 15, 2009, and on September 18 in Europe and Australia. A Game of the Year edition {{was released on}} March 26, 2010, in Europe and on May 11 in North America. Feral Interactive developed an Mac OS X version, which was released on disc and as a download on November 3, 2011. On the Windows version of the game, the developers used an anti-duplication measure that disables Batman's glide ability and causes other bugs, preventing copied games from progressing beyond a certain point. Although not the first game to implement such countermeasures, Arkham Asylum received media coverage, as this was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> <b>method</b> of copy protection.|$|E

In epistemology, it has been first used by Nietzsche and later by Michel Foucault, who tried to expand and apply the concept of genealogy <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> <b>method</b> of research in sociology (evinced principally in [...] "histories" [...] of sexuality and punishment).

5000|$|With Wei-Xing Zhou, he has {{introduced}} the [...] "thermal optimal path" [...] method <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> <b>method</b> {{to quantify the}} dynamical evolution of lead-lag structures between two time series. The method consists of constructing a distance matrix based on the matching of all sample data pairs between the two time series, as in recurrence plots. Then, the lag-lead structure is searched for as the optimal path in the distance matrix landscape that minimizes the total mismatch between the two time series, and that obeys a one-to-one causal matching condition. The problem is solved mathematically by transfer matrix techniques, matching the TOP method {{to the problem of}} random directed polymers interacting with random substrates. Applications include the study of the relationships between inflation, inflation change, GDP growth rate and unemployment rate, volatilities of the US inflation rate versus economic growth rates, the US stock market versus the Federal funds rate and Treasury bond yields and the UK and US real-estate versus monetary policies.|$|E

40|$|Objective For {{measuring}} serum 3, 30, 50 -triiodothyronine (rT 3) levels, radioimmunoassay (RIA) has tra-ditionally {{been used}} {{owing to the}} lack of other reliable methods; however, it has recently become difficult to perform. Meanwhile, liquid chromatography-tandemmass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has recently been attracting attention <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> alternative <b>method</b> in clinical chemistry. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies to date comparing results of the quantification of human serum rT 3 between LC-MS/MS and RIA. We therefore exam-ined the feasibility of LC-MS/MS <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>novel</b> alternative <b>method</b> for measuring serum rT 3, thyroxine (T 4), and 3, 5, 30 -triiodothyronine (T 3) levels. Methods Assay validation was performed by LC-MS/MS using quality control samples of rT 3, T 4, and T 3 at 4 various concentrations which were prepared from reference compounds. Serum samples of 50 outpatients in our department were quantified both by LC-MS/MS and con-ventional immunoassay for rT 3, T 4, and T 3. Correlation coefficients between the 2 mea-surement methods were statistically analyzed respectively. Results Matrix effects were not observed with our method. Intra-day and inter-day precisions were less than 10. 8 % and 9. 6 % for each analyte at each quality control level, respectively.
