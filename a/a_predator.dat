5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Predator</b> ship uncloaks {{and several}} Predators appear. They {{retrieve}} their fallen comrade and an elite Predator presents Alexa {{with one of}} their spear weapons in recognition of her skill as a warrior symbolized by the alien blood Scar burned on her cheek before he died. As the Predators retreat into space, a chestburster with a hybrid form of an Alien and <b>a</b> <b>Predator</b> erupts from Scar's chest.|$|E
5|$|Male double drummers also emit a {{distress}} call—a sharp fragmented irregular noise—upon being {{seized by}} <b>a</b> <b>predator.</b>|$|E
5|$|The escape {{response}} in gastropods—the perception of stimuli (for example, {{the presence of}} <b>a</b> <b>predator</b> nearby) and a subsequent escape motion—is a frequent target of behavioural studies. In gastropods, the perception of environmental chemical stimuli originating, for example, from food or other organisms is possibly mediated by sensory organs such as the osphradium. In the case of L.canarium, the perception of <b>a</b> <b>predator</b> can occur through chemoreception or vision (a well-developed sense in strombid gastropods). The presence of <b>a</b> <b>predator</b> can significantly alter the movement pattern of L.canarium, inducing {{an increase in the}} frequency of leaps.|$|E

5|$|Defensive {{structures}} such as spines may be {{used both}} to ward off attack as already mentioned, and if need be to fight back against <b>a</b> <b>predator.</b> Methods of fighting back include chemical defences, mobbing, defensive regurgitation, and suicidal altruism.|$|E
5|$|In {{communal}} defence, prey groups actively {{defend themselves}} by grouping together, and sometimes by attacking or mobbing <b>a</b> <b>predator,</b> rather than allowing {{themselves to be}} passive victims of predation. Mobbing is the harassing of <b>a</b> <b>predator</b> by many prey animals. Mobbing is usually done to protect the young in social colonies. For example, red colobus monkeys exhibit mobbing when threatened by chimpanzees, a common predator. The male red colobus monkeys group together and place themselves between predators and the group's females and juveniles. The males jump together and actively bite the chimpanzees. Fieldfares are birds which may nest either solitarily or in colonies. Within colonies, fieldfares mob and defecate on approaching predators, shown experimentally to reduce predation levels.|$|E
5|$|Non-bluffing (aposematic) {{displays}} {{occur in}} mammals which possess powerful defences such as spines or stink glands, and which habitually warn off potential predators rather than attempting escape by running. The lowland streaked tenrec (Hemicentetes semispinosus) raises the spines {{on its head}} and back when confronted by <b>a</b> <b>predator,</b> and moves its head up and down. Porcupines such as Erethizon erect their long sharp quills and adopt a hunched, head-down posture when <b>a</b> <b>predator</b> is nearby. The spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius) balances on its front legs, its body raised vertically with its bold pelage pattern conspicuously displayed, and its tail (near the scent glands) raised and spread out.|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>predators,</b> Philippine tarsiers {{may help}} to {{structure}} insect communities. To {{the extent that it}} is preyed upon by other animals, it may impact predator populations.|$|R
40|$|Predation {{occurs in}} a context defined by both prey and non-prey species. At present it is largely unknown how species {{diversity}} in general, and species that {{are not included in}} <b>a</b> <b>predator's</b> diet in particular, modify predator–prey interactions. Therefore we studied how both the density and diversity of non-prey species modified predation rates in experimental microcosms. We found that even a low density of a single non-prey species depressed the asymptote of <b>a</b> <b>predator's</b> functional response. Increases in the density and diversity of non-prey species further reduced predation rates to very low levels. Controls showed that this diversity effect was not due to the identity of any of the non-prey species. Our results establish that both the density and diversity of species outside <b>a</b> <b>predator's</b> diet can significantly weaken the strength of predator–prey interactions. These results have major implications for ecological theory on species interactions in simple vs. complex communities. We discuss our findings in terms of the relationship between diversity and stability. ...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the ways}} prey {{switching}} has been identified and defined is when <b>a</b> <b>predator's</b> preference for <b>a</b> particular type of prey increases as the prey increase in abundance. The result is a strong preference for prey which are common in the environment and a weak preference for prey which are rare. The definition of preference will therefore impact on understanding switching. The most common definition of preference {{is the relationship between}} the ratio of prey in the environment and the ratio of prey in <b>a</b> <b>predator's</b> diet. It has been independently proposed a number of times and is described by the equation: ...|$|R
5|$|Stotting, {{for example}} in Thomson's Gazelle, is cited {{as an example of}} signalling: the gazelles jump close to <b>a</b> <b>predator</b> instead of escaping, in what could be a signal of strength.|$|E
5|$|The {{debate about}} whether Tyrannosaurus was <b>a</b> <b>predator</b> or a pure {{scavenger}} {{is as old as}} the debate about its locomotion. Lambe (1917) described a good skeleton of Tyrannosaurus’ close relative Gorgosaurus and concluded that it and therefore also Tyrannosaurus was a pure scavenger, because the Gorgosaurus’ teeth showed hardly any wear. This argument is no longer taken seriously, because theropods replaced their teeth quite rapidly. Ever since the first discovery of Tyrannosaurus most scientists have agreed that it was <b>a</b> <b>predator,</b> although like modern large predators it would have been happy to scavenge or steal another predator's kill if it had the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|The predatory {{ground beetle}} L. grandis is <b>a</b> <b>predator</b> {{of both the}} eggs and larvae of L. decemlineata, and its larvae are parasitoids of the pupae. An adult L. grandis may consume up to 23 eggs or 3.3 larvae in a single day.|$|E
5000|$|A {{hypothesis}} was tested in South America {{to see if}} species of birds would respond more aggressively to <b>an</b> adult <b>predator</b> (<b>a</b> hawk) than their Northern counterparts because they care more about future reproductive success due to a smaller brood size. On the other hand, those in North America respond more aggressively to <b>an</b> offspring <b>predator</b> (<b>a</b> jay) because they care more about their current brood due to a larger brood size.

25|$|On 5 May 2013, <b>an</b> MQ-1 <b>Predator</b> surpassed 20,000 {{flight hours}} over Afghanistan by <b>a</b> single <b>Predator.</b> Predator P107 {{achieved}} the milestone while flying a 21-hour combat mission; P107 was first delivered in October 2004.|$|R
50|$|On Antares-5, Salif {{intends to}} shoot an animal at a waterhole for dinner, {{when it is}} ambushed by <b>a</b> {{submerged}} <b>predator.</b> <b>As</b> it is eating, <b>a</b> third <b>predator,</b> <b>a</b> black, cloak-like thing covers them both. On the way back, he shoots a flying creature. Recovering it, Liang Mei is stung by a small mosquito-sized metal insect, with twin rotors. They {{put it in a}} specimen container, but after they return to base, they find that it has vanished from the bottle.|$|R
5|$|The spiny {{plates on}} the back and tail of the tuatara {{resemble}} those of a crocodile more than a lizard, but the tuatara shares with lizards the ability to break off its tail when caught by <b>a</b> <b>predator,</b> and then regenerate it.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} vocalizations are used and, like other corvids, grey jays may mimic other bird species, {{especially}} predators. Calls include a whistled quee-oo, and various clicks and chuckles. When predators are spotted, the bird announces {{a series of}} harsh clicks to signal a threat on the ground, or a series of repeated whistles to indicate <b>a</b> <b>predator</b> in the air.|$|E
5|$|Adult common loons {{have few}} predators, {{although}} bald eagles will attack incubating birds. Attacks by sharks in winter {{have also been}} recorded. When <b>a</b> <b>predator</b> approaches (either the loon's nest or the loon itself), the common loon sometimes attacks the predator by rushing at it and trying to stab it with its dagger-like bill, aiming its attacks either at the predator's abdomen or the back of its head or neck.|$|E
5000|$|There {{was some}} {{controversy}} during the game. <b>A</b> <b>Predators</b> goal was called {{back when the}} referee blew a [...] "quick whistle." [...] Referee Kevin Pollock {{lost sight of the}} puck when it was actually loose in the goal crease.|$|R
50|$|It is {{believed}} that Dinaelurus was <b>a</b> cursorial <b>predator,</b> meaning it ran down its prey. This {{is suggested by the}} nimravid's short face and large nostrils, similar to those of a cheetah, which is also <b>a</b> cursorial <b>predator,</b> as Martin suggests.|$|R
50|$|In ecology, {{top-down}} control {{refers to}} when <b>a</b> top <b>predator</b> controls the structure or population {{dynamics of the}} ecosystem. The classic example is of kelp forest ecosystems. In such ecosystems, sea otters are <b>a</b> keystone <b>predator.</b> They prey on urchins which in turn eat kelp. When otters are removed, urchin populations grow and reduce the kelp forest creating urchin barrens. In other words, such ecosystems are not controlled by productivity of the kelp but rather <b>a</b> top <b>predator.</b>|$|R
5|$|Batesian mimicry {{is a form}} of mimicry where a {{harmless}} species has evolved to imitate the warning signals of a harmful species directed at <b>a</b> <b>predator</b> of them both. It is named after the English naturalist Henry Walter Bates, after his work on butterflies in the rainforests of Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Communally {{roosting}} birds, the dusky woodswallow has {{a variety}} of chattering calls which are used in certain situations. The most distinctive of these calls is perhaps the one which is used when <b>a</b> <b>predator</b> or intruder approaches, which consists of a harsh mobbing call to warn others.|$|E
5|$|Dimorphodon {{has been}} envisioned as a puffin {{analogue}} in the past, but its jaw structure and gait, combined with its poor flight capabilities, {{indicate that it}} was a terrestrial/semiarboreal feeder. It seems to have been <b>a</b> <b>predator</b> of small mammals and squamates, and possibly also preyed on large insects.|$|E

50|$|Melo melo {{is known}} to be carnivorous, as {{laboratory}} experiments have shown. It is <b>a</b> specialized <b>predator</b> of other continental shelf predatory gastropods, notably Hemifusus tuba (Melongenidae) and Babylonia lutosa (Buccinidae).

5|$|Henry Walter Bates's 1863 book The Naturalist on the River Amazons {{describes}} his extensive {{studies of the}} insects in the Amazon basin, and especially the butterflies. He discovered that apparently similar butterflies often belonged to different families, with a harmless species mimicking a poisonous or bitter-tasting species to reduce its chance of being attacked by <b>a</b> <b>predator,</b> in the process now called after him, Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|In a {{laboratory}} experiment, Podisus maculiventris {{was used as}} a predatory threat to female L. decemlineata specimens, resulting in the production of unviable trophic eggs alongside viable ones; this response to <b>a</b> <b>predator</b> ensured that additional food was available for newly hatched offspring in order to increase their survival rate. The same experiment also demonstrated the cannibalism of unhatched eggs by newly hatched L. decemlineata larvae as an anti-predator response.|$|E
5|$|In many {{bivalves}} {{that have}} siphons, {{they can be}} retracted back into {{the safety of the}} shell. If the siphons inadvertently get attacked by <b>a</b> <b>predator,</b> they snap off. The animal can regenerate them later, a process that starts when the cells close to the damaged site become activated and remodel the tissue back to its pre-existing form and size.|$|E
40|$|Prey-flock {{deformation}} {{was investigated}} in response to <b>a</b> <b>predator’s</b> attack with molecular dy-namics (MD) simulations in a two-dimensional continuous model.

50|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that, judging by {{an analysis of}} stomach content, the species feeds primarily on bottom-dwelling creatures, habitually eating anything it comes across that has food value and that is small enough to ingest. <b>As</b> <b>predators,</b> {{they are capable of}} being a specialist species.|$|R
