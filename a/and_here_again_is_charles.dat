60|$|I {{came into}} Oxford Street by the Marble Arch, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>again</b> <b>were</b> black powder <b>and</b> several bodies, and an evil, ominous smell from the {{gratings}} of the cellars {{of some of}} the houses. I grew very thirsty after the heat of my long walk. With infinite trouble I managed to break into a public-house and get food and drink. I was weary after eating, and went into the parlour behind the bar, and slept on a black horsehair sofa I found there.|$|R
6000|$|... "I rather think I {{wish we had}} {{not seen}} him, my dear," [...] says mamma, who has been {{described}} as a most sentimental woman and eager novel-reader; <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>again</b> they <b>were</b> interrupted by Miss Hetty, who cried: ...|$|R
60|$|Without another word, Alick Keith {{opened the}} pages at the lace-school; <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>again</b> the figures <b>were</b> identical, though the margin had been {{differently}} finished off.|$|R
6000|$|... 'This is not right, you know, waiter. Look here! here's yesterday's sherry, one <b>and</b> eightpence, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> we <b>are</b> <b>again,</b> two shillings. And {{what does}} sixpence mean?' ...|$|R
60|$|Also {{he preached}} to the adults, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>again</b> <b>was</b> very {{successful}} in a way, especially after he became {{more familiar with the}} language. They listened; to a certain extent they understood; they argued and put to poor Bastin the most awful questions such as the whole Bench of Bishops could not have answered. Still he did answer them somehow, and they politely accepted his interpretation of their theological riddles. I observed that he got on best when he was telling them stories out of the Old Testament, such as the account of the creation of the world and of human beings, also of the Deluge, etc. Indeed one of their elders said--Yes, this was quite true. They had heard it all before from their fathers, and that once the Deluge had taken place round Orofena, swallowing up great countries, but sparing them because they were so good.|$|R
60|$|With {{these words}} she {{advanced}} to {{the margin of the}} brook, took up the scarlet letter, and fastened it again into her bosom. Hopefully, but a moment ago, as Hester had spoken of drowning it in the deep sea, {{there was a sense of}} inevitable doom upon her as she thus received back this deadly symbol from the hand of fate. She had flung it into infinite space! she had drawn an hour's free breath! <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>again</b> <b>was</b> the scarlet misery glittering on the old spot! So it ever is, whether thus typified or no, that an evil deed invests itself with the character of doom. Hester next gathered up the heavy tresses of her hair and confined them beneath her cap. As if there were a withering spell in the sad letter, her beauty, the warmth and richness of her womanhood, departed like fading sunshine, and a gray shadow seemed to fall across her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Will {{you look}} here? This {{is worse than}} before. DO you understand? Here's yesterday's sherry, one <b>and</b> eightpence, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> we <b>are</b> <b>again</b> two shillings. And what the devil does ninepence mean?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{tell you}} again,' said Mr. Indignation Cocker, 'here's yesterday's sherry--can't you see it?--one <b>and</b> eightpence, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> we <b>are</b> <b>again,</b> two shillings. What {{do you make}} of one and eightpence and two shillings?' ...|$|R
6000|$|But the squire had not died, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> he <b>was</b> <b>again</b> at Tretton as the squire's guest. [...] "I think," [...] said Mr. Grey, [...] "that {{the less}} said about {{a good deal}} of it the better." ...|$|R
30|$|The DoF metric is {{insightful}} {{to identify}} the multiplexing gains of the MISO BC at high SNR but fails to capture the diversity of channel strengths among users. This limitation is countered by the generalized DoF (GDoF) framework, which inherits the tractability of the DoF framework while capturing the diversity in channel strengths [35]. In [36, 37], the GDoF of an underloaded MISO BC with imperfect CSIT <b>is</b> studied, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>again,</b> RS <b>is</b> used {{as part of the}} achievability scheme.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{his house}} we're in, now. He left the force three years ago, came over <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> bought this place. <b>And</b> <b>here</b> we <b>are</b> <b>again,</b> all {{gathered}} {{together under the}} same roof, like a jolly little family party." ...|$|R
40|$|A direct {{examination}} with {{the method of}} perfusion of the excretion by the frog's kidney of phenol red and neutral red {{has shown that the}} dyes are eliminated in different manners as a result of different mechanisms. The former is excreted in much the greater part by the glomeruli; the latter by the tubules. Urea is excreted {{in a manner similar to}} phenol red. The in{{direct examination}} of the function of the mammalian kidney by means of excretion ratios has shown a like contrast between the manner of elimination of the two dyes, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>again</b> <b>was</b> found a similarity in the manner of excretion of phenol red and urea. This would seem to be as close an examination as can be made with our present methods of experimentation of the question of the mechanism of the excretion of these substances by mammals. As the facts stand they constitute strong presumptive evidence that in mammals and amphibia the like results have arisen from like causes, phenol red and urea being eliminated chiefly through the glomeruli in both instances while neutral red is excreted principally through the tubules...|$|R
60|$|This time, the {{interest}} was grown {{too hot to}} admit of toleration of the boys on the stone posts. The homicidal white-lead worker made a pounce upon one boy who was hoisting himself up, and brought him to earth amidst general commendation. Closely stowed as we were, we yet formed into groups--groups of conversation, without separation from the mass--to discuss the old man. Rivals of the tall and sallow mason sprang into being, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>again</b> <b>was</b> popular inconstancy. These rivals attracted audiences, and were greedily listened to; and whereas they had derived their information solely from the tall and sallow one, officious members of the crowd now sought to enlighten HIM on their authority. Changed by this social experience into an iron-visaged and inveterate misanthrope, the mason glared at mankind, and evidently cherished in his breast the wish that {{the whole of the}} present company could change places with the deceased old man. And now listeners became inattentive, and people made a start forward at a slight sound, and an unholy fire kindled in the public eye, and those next the gates beat at them impatiently, as if they were of the cannibal species and hungry.|$|R
50|$|The {{painting}} “Jakhodo” {{is about}} a magpie and a tiger. The letter “jak” means magpie; “ho” means tiger; and “do” means painting. Since the work is known to keep away evil influence, there is a tradition to hang the art piece in {{the house in the}} first month of the lunar calendar. On a branch of a green pine tree sits a magpie and the tiger, with a humorous expression, looks up at the bird. The tiger in “Jakhodo” doesn’t look anything like a strong creature with power <b>and</b> authority. <b>Here</b> <b>again</b> <b>is</b> Gu.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, making Septimius take pen and ink, she {{proceeded}} {{to tell him}} a list of plants and herbs, and forest productions, and {{he was surprised to}} find that it agreed most wonderfully with the recipe contained in the old manuscript, as he had puzzled it out, and as it had been explained by the doctor. There were a few variations, it is true; but even here there was a close analogy, plants indigenous to America being substituted for cognate productions, the growth of Europe. Then there was another difference in the mode of preparation, Aunt Keziah's nostrum being a concoction, whereas the old manuscript gave a process of distillation. This similarity had a strong effect on Septimius's imagination. Here was, in one case, a drink suggested, as might be supposed, to a primitive people by something similar to that instinct by which the brute creation recognizes the medicaments suited to its needs, so that they mixed up fragrant herbs for reasons wiser than they knew, and made them into a salutary potion; <b>and</b> <b>here,</b> <b>again,</b> <b>was</b> a drink contrived by the utmost skill of a great civilized philosopher, searching the whole field of science for his purpose; and these two drinks proved, in all essential particulars, to be identically the same.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a {{singular}} being!" [...] observed her friend. [...] "I thought I knew you quite well; I begin {{to find myself}} mistaken. You were silent as the grave about Mrs. Pryor, <b>and</b> now <b>again</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> another secret. But why you made it a secret is the mystery to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh!' said Mr. Cocker, {{with his}} fire {{surprisingly}} quenched by this apparition; 'I wished {{to ask about}} this bill of mine, because {{it appears to me}} that there's a little mistake here. Let me show you. Here's yesterday's sherry one <b>and</b> eightpence, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> we <b>are</b> <b>again</b> two shillings. And how do you explain ninepence?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “We {{shall never}} {{discover}} them, my good sir,” Hewson said. “How can any {{man in the}} world say that that money belongs to a ship that has disappeared in the Malay Archipelago? The only possible clue is that afforded by the chronometers, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>again</b> it <b>is</b> unlikely in the extreme that the owners of the ship, that has, perhaps, been sailing the seas for thirty or forty years, would be able to swear to her chronometers. Lastly, there is no shadow of proof that the chest in which the money was found came from the same ship as the chronometers; they may be the proceeds of two different acts of piracy. You will never hear anything about it.” ...|$|R
60|$|Two towers {{she passed}} before she came {{at last to}} the stream, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>again</b> <b>was</b> she temperate, {{drinking}} but little and that very slowly, contenting herself with rinsing her mouth frequently and bathing her face, her hands, and her feet; {{and even though the}} night was cold, as Martian nights are, the sensation of refreshment more than compensated for the physical discomfort of the low temperature. Replacing her sandals she sought among the growing track near the stream for whatever edible berries or tubers might be planted there, and found a couple of varieties that could be eaten raw. With these she replaced some of the usa in her pocket-pouch, not only to insure a variety but because she found them more palatable. Occasionally she returned to the stream to drink, but each time moderately. Always were her eyes and ears alert for the first signs of danger, but she had neither seen nor heard aught to disturb her. And presently the time approached when she felt she must return to her flier lest she be caught in the revealing light of low swinging Thuria. She dreaded leaving the water for she knew that she must become very thirsty before she could hope to come again to the stream. If she only had some little receptacle in which to carry water, even a small amount would tide her over until the following night; but she had nothing and so she must content herself as best she could with the juices of the fruit and tubers she had gathered.|$|R
60|$|Later {{still in}} the night, {{we came to a}} nauseous room with an earth floor, into which the refuse scum of an alley trickled. The stench of this {{habitation}} was abominable; the seeming poverty of it, diseased <b>and</b> dire. Yet, <b>here</b> <b>again,</b> <b>was</b> visitor or lodger--a man sitting before the fire, like the rest of them elsewhere, and apparently not distasteful to the mistress's niece, who was also before the fire. The mistress herself had the misfortune of being in jail.|$|R
25|$|That year {{also saw}} the massive strikes that began in Gastonia, North Carolina, and Elizabethton, Tennessee, which were violently {{suppressed}} by local police <b>and</b> vigilantes. <b>Here</b> <b>again,</b> workers <b>were</b> often more militant than their trade union leadership: to take one striking example, the workers at the Loray Mill in Gastonia walked out {{under the leadership of}} the communist-led National Textile Workers Union. The Communist Party founded the NTWU in its short-lived attempt to create revolutionary unions.|$|R
60|$|August 26th.--All past affairs, all home conclusions, {{all people}} whom I have known in America <b>and</b> meet <b>again</b> <b>here,</b> <b>are</b> strangely {{compelled}} {{to undergo a}} new trial. It {{is not that they}} suffer by comparison with circumstances of English life and forms of English manhood or womanhood; but, being free from my old surroundings, and the inevitable prejudices of home, I decide upon them absolutely.|$|R
60|$|About an hour after, mass being {{somewhat}} hastily {{run through}} by Sir Oliver, the company {{gathered in the}} hall for dinner. It was a long, low apartment, strewn with green rushes, and the walls hung with arras in a design of savage men <b>and</b> questing bloodhounds; <b>here</b> <b>and</b> there hung spears and bows and bucklers; a fire blazed in the big chimney; there were arras-covered benches round the wall, {{and in the midst}} the table, fairly spread, awaited the arrival of the diners. Neither Sir Daniel nor his lady made their appearance. Sir Oliver himself <b>was</b> absent, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>again</b> there <b>was</b> no word of Matcham. Dick began to grow alarmed, to recall his companion's melancholy forebodings, and to wonder to himself if any foul play had befallen him in that house.|$|R
50|$|The MSI {{questions}} {{in this category}} are more detailed. They divide production and distribution in their different branches like media equipment, newsprint, and printing facilities, kiosks, transmitters, cable, Internet, mobile. And <b>again</b> the questions <b>are</b> devised positively with words like apolitical or not restricted. In contrast the Freedom of the Press Index does not divide production and distribution in different branches <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>again</b> the question <b>is</b> asked in a direct way {{in order to get}} an exact answer to what it wants to measure: the restrictions.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall not}} be wanting," [...] said the Abbot, {{collecting}} himself with importance, [...] "to do whatever may advantage Holy Kirk--thyself shall hear the charge to our Bailiff <b>and</b> our officials--but <b>here</b> <b>again</b> <b>is</b> our controversy with the warden of the bridge and the Baron of Meigallot--Saint Mary! vexations do so multiply upon the House, and upon the generation, that a man wots not where to turn to! Thou didst say, Father Eustace, thou wouldst look into our evidents touching this free passage for the pilgrims?" ...|$|R
60|$|On September twelfth {{the party}} scaled {{a line of}} {{sandstone}} cliffs which crossed their route toward the south; but they crossed them only after an encounter with the tribe that inhabited the numerous caves which pitted {{the face of the}} escarpment. That night they camped upon a rocky plateau which was sparsely wooded with jarrah, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> once <b>again</b> they <b>were</b> visited by the weird, nocturnal apparition that had already filled them with a nameless terror.|$|R
6000|$|... "It has {{not been}} pleasant," [...] Mrs. Conway said quietly. [...] "But I {{preferred}} it to the long journey by coach up to London, <b>and</b> down <b>here</b> <b>again.</b> We <b>were</b> five days on the way, as the vessel put in at so many ports. Still {{that was quite a}} minor question with me. I wanted to see you and have a talk with you personally. There is no saying into whose hands letters may fall, and one talk face to face does more good than a score of letters." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{said that}} in the {{creation}} of such a system we may profit by the example of Germany; we may do more, we may improve upon the example of Germany. The German Exchanges, though co-ordinated and encouraged to some extent by State and Imperial Governments, are mainly municipal in their scope. Starting here with practically a clear field and with the advantage of the experiment and the experience of other lands to guide us, we may begin upon a higher level and upon a larger scale. There is {{reason to believe that the}} utility of a system like Labour Exchanges, like utility of any other market, increases in proportion to its range and scope. We therefore propose, as a first principle, that our system shall be uniform and national in its character; <b>and</b> <b>here,</b> <b>again,</b> we <b>are</b> supported both by the Minority and by the Majority Reports of the Royal Commission.|$|R
60|$|These cat-fish, however, are not {{the only}} good fathers that carry their young (like woodcock) in their own mouths. A {{freshwater}} species of the Sea of Galilee, Chromis Andreæ by name (dedicated by science to the memory of that fisherman apostle, St. Andrew, who must often have netted them), has the same habit of hatching out its young in its own gullet: <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>again</b> it <b>is</b> the male fish upon whom this apparently maternal duty devolves, just as it is the male cassowary that sits upon the eggs of his unnatural mate, and the male emu that tends the nest, while the hen bird looks on superciliously and contents herself with exercising a general friendly supervision of the nursery department. I may add parenthetically that in most fish families the eggs are fertilised after they have been laid, instead of before, which no doubt accounts for the seeming anomaly.|$|R
60|$|Our {{tour was}} completed, {{in spite of}} all annoyances; <b>and</b> <b>here</b> we <b>were</b> <b>again,</b> within the walls of {{magnificent}} Paris! The postilions had been told to drive to the hotel, in the Rue St. Dominique; and we sat down to dinner, an hour after our arrival, under our own roof. My uncle's tenant had left the apartment a month before, according to agreement; and the porter and his wife had engaged a cook, set the rooms in order, and prepared everything for our arrival.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} {{different}} version of Sheila (Downey) Fury's past life. Whereas in The Furys her past is a mystery, about which her husband Desmond never questions her (neither does her lover Peter Fury), in An End and a Beginning, the reader learns that when she first met Desmond, {{she gave him a}} full account of past <b>and</b> family. <b>Again</b> <b>here</b> there <b>is</b> no mention of her being a prostitute, or that Peter in The Secret Journey had seen her with a businessman at a hotel.|$|R
60|$|Now she was angry. Some resentment did arise at a {{perseverance}} so selfish <b>and</b> ungenerous. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>again</b> a want of delicacy and {{regard for}} others which had formerly so struck <b>and</b> disgusted her. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>again</b> a {{something of the}} same Mr. Crawford whom she had so reprobated before. How evidently was there a gross want of feeling and humanity where his own pleasure was concerned; and alas! how always known no principle to supply as a duty what the heart was deficient in! Had her own affections been as free as perhaps {{they ought to have}} been, he never could have engaged them.|$|R
40|$|In the {{following}} pages I offer a basic interpretation of this recent and incomplete queering of Uruguay. I do so using two moments of explanation: the structure and the conjuncture of the country. I am not using these terms in a conceptually complex way. By structure I refer to the historical trajectory and some main stable features of Uruguay that (I will argue) are helpful for making sense of the issues addressed here. From this starting point, we {{will be ready to}} look at what is going on today, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>again</b> it <b>is</b> necessary to choose a window, a point of view: in this case, the spectacular growth in visibility of queer social movements and their success in putting sexual diversity issues onto the social and institutional agenda (Aguilar Villanueva, 1992; 1992 b & 1992 c). But this achievement cannot be understood without considering the arrival of the progressive Frente Amplio (Broad Front) to government in 2004. Thus, I will explore the articulation among queer social movements, public policy and state discourse...|$|R
40|$|We {{thank the}} discussants for their varied and thought {{provoking}} responses although their number and variety makes a short response difficult. One of our goals, amply fulfilled, {{was to have}} extensive discussion of the many questions we raised but {{did not try to}} answer. In particular, Fan, Klaassen, and McNeney and Wellner all addressed questions A and B which we respond to further below. Another goal of ours was to have additional important issues raised <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>again,</b> we <b>were</b> far from disappointed. Fan addressed the testing question. Klaassen, van der Laan and Yu, and Robins and Rotnitzky raised the important issue of robustness. Shen and Li discuss the estimating equation paradigm, relating the information calculus approach to estimating equa- 1 tions. Zhang gives a careful new abstract M estimation theorem. Finally, McNeney and Wellner and Greenwood, Schick and Wefelmeyer directly address question C, the general information calculus we discuss. The latter in particular, in a discussion full of examples, correctly find that our calculations, though not our calculus, were flawed in one of the examples we discuss. We respond briefly to the individual discussions. We begin with general responses to comments on robustness and bandwidth selection. ...|$|R
30|$|Svärd et al. (2011) {{also used}} {{compression}} approach with dynamic page transfer reordering. This approach orders the page transfer {{in such a}} way that retransfer of frequently updated pages is reduced. Based on the number of times a page is being updated during migration, page weight for each page is calculated and pages are reordered accordingly. This results into reduced number of pages transferred during migration. For further improvement, authors combine this idea with delta compression technique which leads to reduction in both migration time as well as downtime. Delta compression reduces amount of data transferred by sending XOR deltas between previous and current page versions instead of full page. It is highly dependent on fast, efficient page privatization schemes <b>and</b> compression. <b>Here,</b> <b>again</b> overhead <b>is</b> high.|$|R
