2500|$|Verte ("green" [...] in French) absinthe {{begins as}} a blanche. The blanche is altered by the {{colouring}} step, by which a separate mixture of herbs is steeped into the clear distillate.

50|$|The rainbow rose is a rose {{that has}} had its petals <b>artificially</b> <b>coloured.</b> The method {{exploits}} the rose's natural processes by which water is drawn up the stem. By splitting the stem and dipping each part in different coloured water, the colours are drawn into the petals resulting in a multicolored rose. With these changes to the rose, it causes them to not live as long as an uncoloured rose.Besides roses, other cut flowers like the chrysanthemum, carnation, hydrangea, and some species of orchids can also be colored using the same method.|$|R
50|$|A bubble {{is made of}} {{transparent}} water enclosing transparent air. However {{the soap}} film is as thin as the visible light wavelength, resulting in interferences.

Tom Noddy (who featured in the second episode of Marcus du Sautoy's The Code) gave the analogy of looking at a contour map of the bubbles' surface. However, it has become a challenge to produce <b>artificially</b> <b>coloured</b> bubbles.|$|R
40|$|The Rufous Bush Chat Cercotrichas galactotes is parasitized by the Cuckoo Cuculus canorus. To {{study how}} a Cuckoo elicits {{provisioning}} by this specific host species, {{the response of}} the Rufous Bush Chats to two imitations of the coloration of the gape of Cuckoo nestlings was tested. In pairs of experimental and control own nestlings whose gapes had been <b>artificially</b> <b>coloured,</b> body mass changes were recorded over 2 -hr periods. Body mass increase was used as an indicator of the amount of food provided by the parents. Both in the experimental chicks in 20 nests with gapes <b>artificially</b> <b>coloured</b> plain orange (imitating the coloration of the Cuckoo's gape) and in the experimental chicks in 18 nests with gapes coloured to imitate the design of the Cuckoo's gape, body mass increase was higher than in the controls. Experimental chicks apparently received greater amounts of food than the controls. No significant difference was detected between the effects of both experimental treatments. Therefore, in this particular gens of Cuckoo, parasitizing Rufous Bush Chats in southern Spain, either the gape's intense coloration or its characteristic visual pattern may act as supernormal stimuli. So far in other host species no effect of gape coloration has been found. The conspicuous gape colour and pattern could be playing a more important role stimulating food provisioning in Rufous Bush Chats than in other hosts species whose nestlings produce more begging calls. The specific coloration of the Cuckoo chick may have evolved to exploit the provisioning response of hosts towards their own nestlings. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

Thus, we present the first experimental evidence of visual signalling in carnivorous plants.

40|$|A new <b>coloured</b> <b>reagent</b> for protein modification, alpha-bromo- 4 -amino- 3 -nitroacetophenone (NH 2 BrNphAc), was synthesized. The reagent {{was found}} to {{alkylate}} specifically the methionine- 290 residue of porcine pepsin below pH 3 at 37 degrees C, which lead to a 45 % decrease of enzyme's activity towards haemoglobin. The effect of this reagent {{as well as that}} of other phenacyl bromides on the activity of pepsin appeared to be a result of steric hindrance caused by the attachment of bulky reagent residue to the edge of the cleft harbouring the enzyme active site. Only marginal reaction with the co-carboxy group of aspartic acid- 315 was found under the above conditions. More pronounced esterification of carboxy groups (up to one residue per enzyme molecule) occurred when the pH was shifted to 5. 2. The latter modification had no noticeable effect on enzyme activity, thus disproving a previously held assumption that pepsin inactivation by phenacyl bromide is due to the carboxy-group esterification. alpha-Bromo- 4 -amino- 3 -nitroacetophenone forms derivatives with characteristic u. v. spectra when it reacts with methionine, histidine, aspartic and glutamic acid residues, and may be recommended as a reagent for protein modification...|$|R

When we see some of the monstrous and flamboyant blossoms that enrich the equatorial woods, we do not feel that they are conflagrations of nature; silent explosions of her frightful energy.

40|$|This field {{research}} examines aggressive behaviour towards gasteropod molluscs in nesting territorial male of Symphodus ocellatus. This behaviour {{is useful for}} brood and nest defense. Four questions involving Symphodus ocellatus towards gasteropod molluscs were investigated.

40|$|AbstractA simple {{low cost}} method has been {{developed}} and validated for the determination of trace amounts of palladium (II) ions in water and fertilizer samples. The method {{is based on the}} reaction of palladium (II) ions with the reagent neothorin (2 -(2 -arsonophenylazo) chromotropic acid disodium salt). The complex formed exhibits an absorption maximum at 567 nm (λmax) in Britton–Robinson (BR) buffer (pH= 2). The corrected absorbance of the formed complex at λmax was obtained by employing a β-correction spectrophotometric method. The Beer–Lambert law and Ringbom's plots of the <b>coloured</b> palladium <b>reagent</b> complex were obeyed in the concentration ranges of 0. 05 – 2. 7 and 0. 1 – 2 μgmL− 1 palladium (II) ions, respectively, with relative standard deviations in the range of ± 1. 3 – 2. 1 %. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) of the procedure were 0. 011 and 0. 04 μgmL− 1 palladium, respectively. The proposed method was applied for the analysis of palladium (II) ions in spiked tap, mineral and underground water samples. The results of the developed method were satisfactorily compared with the data obtained by the inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometric (ICP-MS) method.

40|$|Different {{management}} techniques were studied, at the Kromme Rhee Experimental Farm near Stellenbosch, {{in order to}} stimulate feed intake of ostrich chicks and {{to determine the effect}} on their growth rate. A first experiment was conducted to determine the effect of different dietary flavourants on the feed intake of ostrich chicks. Ostrich chicks (1 - 28 days of age), with no previous exposure to flavourants showed a strong preference for salty feed. Another experiment determined the effect of different colourants on the feed intake of ostrich chicks. Exposure of chicks to feed <b>coloured</b> <b>artificially</b> in different colours (green, red, blue and yellow) had no impact on the feed intake of ostrich chicks (1 - 28 days of age). Throughout the study the dry matter intake was the highest for the control diet, indicating that the provision of coloured feed to ostriches, as practised in this study, will not stimulate feed intake. The effect of feed processing and restriction of water availability for ostrich chicks was also examined. Extrusion reduced microbial counts in feed by 99. 7 percent. Feed intake as well as average daily gain of chicks were lowered by both the pelleting and the extrusion process practised in this study. Processing did not have a positive influence on the production of ostrich chicks 6 - 15 weeks of age. Dry matter intake for chicks subjected to water restriction were the same as for birds receiving water ad libitum. Similarly growth rate as well as feed conversion ratio was not effected by restriction of water, as practised in this study. Another technique studied was to determine the effect of 24 h artificial light on feed intake, growth and the behaviour of ostrich chicks (1 - 28 days of age). A Timeactivity budget revealed that chicks subjected to 24 hours of light spent more time eating (14. 7 percent) than those subjected to normal day and night cycles (11. 4 percent). In spite of this, no significant difference in feed intake, growth rate and feed conversion ratio was observed for ostrich chicks subjected to different light regimes. The effect of different dietary salt levels on the production of ostrich chicks (8 - 12 weeks of age) was also determined.
