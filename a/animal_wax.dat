The aim of this thesis was to elaborate a literature review focused on ingredients of fatty phase and their influence on stability of cosmetic emulsions. Emulsions are heterogeneous two-phase dispersive systems. They are formed from two immiscible liquids: one constitutes the droplets which are dispersed in the other liquid. They are classified into emulsion O/W (oil-in-water), W/O (water-in-oil) and multiple emulsions O/W/O and W/O/W (oil-in-water-in-oil, water-in-oil-in-water). In the midst of basic ingredients of fatty phase range raw material of crude petroleum, vegetable oils, <b>animal</b> fats, <b>waxes</b> and sterols.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} {{background}} of the medieval urban economy in Wallachia. Townspeople earned most of their income through trade. Acting as middlemen in the trade between the Levant and Central Europe, the merchants in Braila, Târgoviste, Câmpulung, Bucuresti or Târgsor became involved in trading goods that were local or had been brought from beyond the Carpathians or the Black Sea. Raw materials were the goods of choice, and Wallachia had vast amounts of them: salt, cereals, livestock or <b>animal</b> products, skins, <b>wax,</b> honey; mostly imported were expensive cloth or finer goods, much sought after by the local rulers and boyars. An analysis of the documents indicates that crafts were only secondary, witness the many raw goods imported: fine cloth (brought specifically from Flanders), weapons, tools. Products gained by practicing various crafts were sold, covering the food and clothing demand for townspeople and the rural population. As was the case with Moldavia, Wallachia stood out by its vintage wine, most of it coming from vineyards neighbouring towns. The study also deals with the ethnicity of the merchants present on the Wallachia market. Tradesmen from local towns were joined by numerous Transylvanians (Brasov, Sibiu), but also Balkans (Ragussa) or Poles (Lviv). The Transylvanian ones enjoyed some privileges, such as tax exemptions or reduced customs duties. regional history; medieval trade; charters of privilege; merchants; craftsmen; Wallachia...|$|R

Two water gilding recipes were appropriately chosen from the treatises written by the Portuguese Filipe Nunes (1615) and José Lopes Baptista de Almada (1749) as being representative for Baroque époque. Based on these recipes, the production of raw materials - “gesso grosso”, “gesso fino”, bole, animal glue (from lamb and goat skins) - was made as faithful as possible. Their application was then performed in laboratory following the indications given by these authors or by treatises of previous époques (e. g. the Bolognese treatise for thawing leather), on plane and curved wooden supports (pine and oak species) using three types of leaf: gold (Au/Ag/Cu) of 22 and 23. 75 karat respectively and silver. After the completion of gilding, the samples’ surfaces were divided into areas and on each different finishing layers (<b>wax,</b> <b>animal</b> glue size) and decorations (punching, “esgrafitado”, “estofado”) were applied. An analytical campaign using optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on surfaces and cross sections, X-ray diffraction (XRD), microcomputerized tomography (microCT) and colorimetry (CIEL*a*b*) was undertaken in order to characterize the gilded composites and to assess the faithfulness of the reproductions in the laboratory. Correlations between the information given by the recipes and the composition and stratigraphical patterns of the reconstructions can be established. Furthermore, the study aims to highlight the difficulties encountered in analyzing real samples and comparing the results with those from reproductions as the number and types of layered materials are not always reproducible.

These market analyses suggest that at £ 900 to £ 950 per tonne jojoba wax could compete in the wax markets and might obtain a share of the market of between 2, 000 and 5, 000 tonnes. At £ 500 to £ 600 per tonne jojoba oil could compete with sperm oil which at present has a market of below 20, 000 tonnes, although this will probably have been eroded to a substantial extent by synthetics by the time jojoba oil is available in quantities of this order. In particular, in this latter market jojoba oil might be used by the leather, lubricants and pharmaceutical industries. If, for illustrative purposes, a 25, 000 tonne market were to be secured and a future yield of 2. 5 tonnes per hectare of oil obtained, a cultivated area of 10, 000 hectares of jojoba would suffice. This is a very small area in global terms and it seems, therefore, that jojoba is unlikely to provide more than a minor new source of income for a few developing countries.

5000|$|Two Huainanzi {{chapters}} metaphorically use [...] "sun {{and moon}} mirrors" [...] to exemplify yang and yin categories and elucidate the Chinese notion of ganying [...] "cosmic resonance" [...] through which categorically identical things mutually resonate and influence each other. The yángsuì 陽燧 [...] "burning-mirror" [...] is yang, round, and sun-like; the fāngzhū 方諸 [...] "square receptacle" [...] is yin, square, and moon-like. The first context describes yangsui and fangzhu mirrors jiàn 見 [...] "seeing" [...] {{the sun and}} moon. The Way of Heaven is called the Round; the Way of Earth is called the Square. The square governs the obscure; the circular governs the bright. The bright emits qi, {{and for this reason}} fire is the external brilliance of the sun. The obscure sucks in qi, and for this reason water is the internal luminosity of the moon. Emitted qi endows; retained qi transforms. Thus yang endows and yin transforms. The unbalanced qi of Heaven and Earth, becoming perturbed, causes wind; the harmonious qi of Heaven and Earth, becoming calm, causes rain. When yin and yang rub against each other, their interaction 感 produces thunder. Aroused, they produce thunderclaps; disordered they produce mist. When the yang qi prevails, it scatters to make rain and dew; when the yin qi prevails, it freezes to make frost and snow. Hairy and feather creatures make up the class of flying and walking things and are subject to yang. Creatures with scales and shells make up the class of creeping and hiding things and are subject to yin. The sun is the ruler of yang. Therefore, in spring and summer animals shed their fur; at the summer solstice, stags' antlers drop off. The moon is the fundament of yin. Therefore when the moon wanes, the brains of fish shrink; when the moon dies, wasps and crabs shrivel up. Fire flies upward; water flows downward. Thus, the flight of birds is aloft; the movement of fishes is downward. Things within the same class mutually move one another; root and twig mutually respond to each other 相應. Therefore, when the burning mirror sees the sun, it ignites tinder and produces fire 故陽燧見日則燃而為火. When the square receptacle sees the moon, it moistens and produces water 方諸見月則津而為水. When the tiger roars, the valley winds rush; when the dragon arises, the bright clouds accumulate. When qilins wrangle, the sun or moon is eclipsed; when the leviathan dies, comets appear. When silkworms secrete fragmented silk, the shang string a stringed instrument snaps. When meteors fall, the Bohai surges upward. (3.2, tr. Major et al. 2010: 115-116) The second mentions some of the same yinyang and ganying folk-beliefs. That things in their various categories are mutually responsive 相應 is something dark, mysterious, deep, and subtle. Knowledge is not capable of assessing it; argument is not capable of explaining it. Thus, when the east wind arrives, wine turns clear and overflows vessels; when silkworms secrete fragmented silk, the shang string a stringed instrument snaps. Something has stimulated 感 them. When a picture is traced out with the ashes of reeds, the moon's halo has a corresponding gap. When the leviathan dies, comets appear. Something has moved them. Thus, when a sage occupies the throne, he embraces the Way and does not speak, and his nurturance reaches to the myriad people. But when ruler and ministers harbor distrust in their hearts, back-to-back arcs appear in the sky. The mutual responses 相應 of spirit qi are subtle indeed! Thus, mountain clouds are like grassy hummocks; river clouds are like fish scales; dryland clouds are like smoky fire; cataract clouds are like billowing water. All resemble their forms and evoke responses 感 according to their class. The burning mirror takes fire from the sun; the square receptacle takes dew from the moon 夫陽燧取火於日方諸取露於月. Of the things between Heaven and Earth, even a skilled astrologer cannot master all their techniques. Even a hand can hold minutely tiny and indistinct things cannot grasp a beam of light. However, from what is within the palm of one's hand, one can trace correlative categories to beyond the extreme end point the cosmos. Thus that one can set up implements and produce water and fire is function of the mutually responsive movement of yin and yang of the same qi. (6.2, tr. Major et al. 2010:216-217) The Huainanzi commentary of Gao You (fl. 210 CE) says,The burning mirror is of metal. One takes a metal cup untarnished with verdigris and polishes it strongly, then it is heated by being made to face the sun at noon time; in this position cause it to play upon mugwort tinder and this will take fire. The fangzhu is the Yin mirror 陰燧; it is like a large clam(-shell) 大蛤. It is also polished and held under the moonlight at full moon; water collects upon it, which can be received in drops upon the bronze plate. So the statements of our ancient teacher are really true. (tr. Needham and Wang 1962: 88) According to Needham and Wang (1962: 90), this comparison between a fangzhu mirror that drew water from the moon and a bivalve shell reflects an ancient Chinese confusion between beliefs about moon-mirrors and beliefs that certain marine <b>animals</b> <b>waxed</b> and waned in correspondence with the moon. For example, the (c. 3rd century BCE) Guanzi says,The virtue of a ruler is what all the people obey, just as the moon is the root and fount of all Yin things. So at full moon, shellfish 蚌蛤 are fleshy, and all that is Yin abounds. When the moon has waned, the shellfish are empty and Yin things weak. When the moon appears in the heavens all Yin things are influenced right down to the depths of the sea. So the sage lets virtue flow forth from himself, and the four outer wildernesses rejoice in his benevolent love. (tr. Needham and Wang 1962: 31) The authors compare Aristotle's (c. 350 BCE) Parts of Animals recording that some kinds of sea urchins were fat and good to eat at the full moon, {{which was one of the}} oldest biological observations about the lunar periodicity of the reproductive system of echinoderms, especially sea urchins.|$|R

The genus has {{a predominantly}} Australian distribution, {{but in recent}} years this species has been recorded from the western parts of England and Wales (Waterston and Quick, 1937; Pantin, 1944). In this genus the nephridial system is highly developed, and its structure in several species has been described by Hett (1924), Coe (1929), and others. Stammer (1934) mentioned the existence of a nephridial system in G. dendyi but did not describe it. The present work arose from a study of this species collected in South Devon, in all stages from the newly hatched young to the adult. The nephridial system proves to be at least as highly developed in this as in other species, and there are points of some interest regarding its function. METHODS The flame-cells and the proximal part of the tubule system into which they open are easily detected in living worms owing to their ciliary activity, particu-larly in newly hatched larvae (about 1 mm. long) and immature specimens of about 3 - 4 mm. in length. The distal parts of the tubule system show no signs of ciliary activity and have not yet been observed in life. The system is best seen if the worms are immersed in tap-water and slightly compressed with a large coverslip, or held by a small square of wet cellophane covering a shallow hanging drop on the underside of a coverslip above a moist chamber. For prolonged observation under a powerful light, absorption of heat-radiation entering the condenser is essential. For micro-anatomical studies the best fixatives were found to be Susa, and Zenker in which formic acid is substituted for acetic. Brief preliminary anaesthetization with 5 - 10 per cent, ethyl alcohol had no apparent ill effects and enabled the specimen to be fixed without distortion. This was done by arranging the <b>animal</b> on a <b>waxed</b> coverslip, covering it with a piece of moist cigarette paper, and dropping it face down on the fixative.

The difficulty in analyzing archaeological samples is due to their composition which generally involves a mixture of different inorganic and organic materials, some times degraded by the environmental conditions. We report the results of the vibrational spectroscopy techniques, such as Raman microscopy (laser 632 nm), FT-Raman spectroscopy (laser 1064 nm) and FT-IR/ATR with a golden gate accessory, of a first approach to the analysis of the ancient samples. The analytical results showed the importance of micro-Raman Spectroscopy in discriminating between inorganic and organic materials, thereby underlining the complexity of pharmaceutical and cosmetic matrices. Raman microscopy is the most suitable technique in order to identify minor inorganic components and contaminants at the micrometric scale inside these complex matrices. On the basis of the FT-IR and micro-Raman spectra, it was possible to identify some specific old cosmetic materials and some binders used in cosmetic preparations. In particular, Raman microscopy was able to identify the presence of constituents at the trace levels or compounds having vibrations at low wavenumbers within the sample examined, that it is not possible with normal FT-IR technique. This technique can easily identify compounds like lead oxide, red lead, cinnabar, rare minerals, (etc.) that could give interesting information about the original composition of the formulate and the provenance of the raw materials. Concerning the organic materials, their possibility of identification is very different from that of inorganic ones. Some compounds were rapidly degraded, some others persisted till to present day, often unchanged (e. g. wax). Historical samples are subjected to ageing and degradation process that make difficult to recognize the raw material originally present. For understanding the possible changes undergone by materials during ageing, a specific database of spectra must be available.

The samples analyzed {{in this study were}} collected from the Egyptian Museum of Turin, Italy. The discovery of the studied archaeological finds was made by Ernesto Schiaparelli (1906 until 1913) and the archaeological founds were dated from the late III millenium b. C. to early II millenium b. C. The sites of finding were in Assiut (at about 400 Km from Cairo {{on the bank of the}} Nile) and Gebelein (south of Assiut), near the southern border with Nubia. In the sarcophagus usually it is possible to find weapons, like bows and arrows, textiles and also ointments. Here the results of the vibrational spectroscopy techniques, such as Raman microscopy (laser 632 nm), FT-Raman spectroscopy (laser 1064 nm) and FT-IR/ATR with a golden gate accessory are reported. These techniques are identified as the most suitable ones for the first approach to ancient samples analysis. Raman microscopy is in fact the most suitable technique in order to identify minor inorganic components and contaminants at the micrometric scale inside these complex matrices 4. This technique can easily identify compounds like lead oxide, vermillion, rare minerals, (etc.) that could give interesting informations about the provenance of the raw materials and the original composition of the formulate.

It can be observed that Titanite is present, a mineral possibly coming from mines in Southern Egypt 5. Concerning to organic materials, their possibility of identification, is very different from that of inorganic ones. Some compounds were rapidly degraded, some others persisted till to present day, often unchanged (e. g. wax). Historical samples give a chemical variability due to the natural products, in addiction, ageing and degradation processes make very difficult to recognize raw materials originally present.

This indicates the importance of this database in recognising the organic materials into archaeological holders...|$|R
40|$|Since {{a decade}} our {{research}} group {{deals with the}} analysis of ancient cosmetics and drugs, starting from the Roman founds. At present some founds from pharmacies of Italy (Genua, Sansepolcro) and Spain (Majorca) amounting to the XVII century and Egyptian ointments of the II millennium b. C. from the Turin Museum are under study. The analysis protocol provides firstly non-destructive analyses and then the more expensive and destructive analyses, such as gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) methods. These measurements involve other research groups of our project supported by a national Fund (PRIN: Colours and ointments in antiquity). We report {{the results of the}} vibrational spectroscopy techniques, such as Raman microscopy (laser 632 nm), FT-Raman spectroscopy (laser 1064 nm) and FT-IR/ATR with a golden gate accessory, were identified as the most suitable techniques for a first approach to the analysis of the ancient samples. Raman microscopy is the most suitable technique in order to identify minor inorganic components and contaminants at the micrometric scale inside these complex matrices 4. This technique can easily identify compounds like lead oxide, vermillion, rare minerals, (etc.) that could give interesting informations about the provenance of the raw materials and the original composition of the formulate. In Tab. 1 are reported some data about the composition of some ancient Egyptian samples. It can be observed that Titanite is present, a mineral possibly coming from mines in Southern Egypt. Concerning to organic materials, their possibility of identification, is very different from that of inorganic ones. Some compounds were rapidly degraded, some others persisted till to present day, often unchanged (e. g. wax). Historical samples give a chemical variability like the natural products, in addiction there are the ageing and the degradation process that make very difficult to recognize the raw material originally present. For understanding the possible changes undergone by materials in ageing, a specific database of spectra must be available. Some thirty raw materials were chosen among oils (e. g. olive, almond, and palm oil), gums (e. g. gum arabic, gum tragacanth), <b>animal</b> fats and <b>waxes</b> commonly employed in the ancient preparations. On the basis of the examination and critical interpretation of ancient literature sources (pharmacopoeias) fifteen samples based on pharmaceutical and cosmetic recipes were prepared as a reference samples. The raw materials and the reference formulations were artificially aged by using heating (in a oven at 60 °C for 1 month), photo-oxidation (with ozone for 20 hours) and enzymatic degradation (by means of a pool of cellulase, lipase and laccase). Concerning the raw materials, only few showed fluorescence in Raman microscopy, but this decreases sharply with the artificial ageing process. This fact could be due to the loss of fluorophores. The artificial ageing produces different alterations according to the type of ageing. Among the first results we reported the analysis of Pompeii sample already identified as palm oil by GC-MS 2. The comparison with our database showed correspondence with palm oil enzymatically degraded. This indicates that this database is interesting in recognising the organic materials into archaeological holders...|$|R
