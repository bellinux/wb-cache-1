INTRODUCTION This paper derives an extensible framework for jointly optimizing the behavior of <b>analog</b> <b>filters</b> {{in terms of their}} magnitude, phase, and step responses, and their implementation in terms of their quality factors. The optimization is performed with respect to the polezero locations, subject to constraints on magnitude response, quality factors, and peak overshoot.

50|$|A {{technique}} {{known as}} oversampling {{is commonly used}} in audio ADCs. The idea {{is to use a}} higher intermediate digital sample rate, so that a nearly-ideal digital filter can sharply cut off aliasing near the original low Nyquist frequency and give better phase response, while a much simpler <b>analog</b> <b>filter</b> can stop frequencies above the new higher Nyquist frequency. Because analog filters have relatively high cost and limited performance, relaxing the demands on the <b>analog</b> <b>filter</b> can greatly reduce both aliasing and cost. Furthermore, because some noise is averaged out, the higher sampling rate can moderately improve SNR.|$|E

In this work, we show that time-domain information obtained from wavelet analysis of supply current {{can be used to}} efficiently test the frequency specification of <b>analog</b> <b>filters.</b> The pole/zero locations in the frequency response of <b>analog</b> <b>filters</b> shift due to change in component values with process variations. It is essential to test the filters for the shift in frequency response and fix it, during production test. Wavelet analysis of supply current can be a promising alternative to test frequency specification of <b>analog</b> <b>filters,</b> since it needs only one ac stimulus and is virtually unaffected by transistor threshold variation. Simulation results on two test circuits demonstrate that we can estimate pole/zero shift with less than 3 % error using only one measurement, which requires about 18 measurements in the conventional technique...|$|R

40|$|We analyze {{out-of-band}} (OOB) {{emissions in}} the massive multi-user (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink. We focus on systems in which the base station (BS) is equipped with low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is used to communicate to the user equipments (UEs) over frequency-selective channels. We demonstrate that <b>analog</b> <b>filtering</b> in combination with simple frequency-domain digital predistortion (DPD) at the BS enables a significant reduction of OOB emissions, but degrades the signal-to-interference-noise-and-distortion ratio (SINDR) at the UEs and increases the peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) at the BS. We use Bussgang's theorem to characterize the tradeoffs between OOB emissions, SINDR, and PAR, and to study the impact of <b>analog</b> <b>filters</b> and DPD on the error-rate performance of the massive MU-MIMO-OFDM downlink.
