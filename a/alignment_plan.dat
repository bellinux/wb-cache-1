50|$|There are {{periodic}} interviews {{required by}} Marine Corps order that a Career Retention Specialist must coordinate for every enlisted Marine entrusted to them. These interviews are categorized as either FTAP (First Term <b>Alignment</b> <b>Plan)</b> or STAP (Subsequent Term <b>Alignment</b> <b>Plan).</b> FTAP Marines {{are the most}} common interviewees. They have four required interviews: The initial interview conducted by the CRS, the CRS FTAP, the CO FTAP, the CRS EAS, and the CO EAS. The initial interview is mainly to introduce Marines to the process of Career Retention and inform them of how better to be competitive for promotion and retention. The FTAP interview is geared toward developing a recommendation for reenlistment and also guiding the Marine in making a decision to leave the Corps or reenlist. The FTAP is conducted by both the CRS and Commanding Officer. The EAS interview is geared toward ensuring the Marine is ready to transition out of the Marine Corps, or {{to see if there is}} still potential for further service.Subsequent Term <b>Alignment</b> <b>Plan</b> interviews are for Marines who are on their second or subsequent contracts and there are three that are required: CRS STAP, CRS EAS, CO EAS. Many STAP Marines reenlist prior to requiring any of these interviews. Only the last EAS interview is conducted by the commanding officer for STAP Marines.|$|E

40|$|Route <b>alignment</b> <b>planning</b> {{for a new}} highway or railway on the {{regional}} level constitutes a complicated planning process which involves the consideration of various data sets and the analysis of such data. It also involves the development of alternative corridors for the potential road and the evaluation of socioeconomic and environmental impacts of such alternatives. The comparison of produced alternatives is another complicated task. In Egypt, {{and particularly in the}} General Authority for Roads, Bridges and Land Transport (GARBLT), those tasks are implemented traditionally using manual systems. The choice of a feasible corridor for a new high way is based solely on the topography of the land. The lack of cooperation between the different local authorities and ministries involved complicates the process of data acquisition, integration and analysis. Subsequently, historical, economical and geological data are not accurately considered. Environmental and social impacts are often neglected. To overcome such deficiency, the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is mandatory to manage the variety of data sets coming from different sources. But before the introduction and application of GIS would be of any benefit to the GARBLT, some institutional changes are required to allow the data collection and exchange among the different authorities and ministries. The main objective of the present Ph. D. study is to demonstrate to the decision makers and transport planners in GARBLT the capabilities and functions of GIS in the field of route <b>alignment</b> <b>planning</b> and the benefits they will gain if they adopt a certain strategy for data acquisition and maintenance, in the hope that they will move towards a more scientific and up-to-date work methodology. The study will attempt to explore and demonstrate the potentials of the use of GIS in the route <b>alignment</b> <b>planning</b> process. It will also identify the information needs of the route <b>alignment</b> <b>planning</b> process and how it can be integrated and structured in a unified data model. The institutional measures needed for data exchange policies will also be recommended. As a means of achieving these objectives a spatial decision support system (SDSS) for the route <b>alignment</b> <b>planning</b> process will be designed and developed using GIS techniques and capabilities. Such a system should allow multi-criteria analysis and evaluation so that transport planner can come up with some alternative road corridors and evaluate the environmental, social, traffic and economic impacts of each corridor. The incorporation of such factors in the route alignment process is one of the additions to the current system which takes place in GARBLT. Another new aspect is the development of a system that can be reapplied several times as it is intended during the present study rather than aiming at finding the optimum route for a certain project as it is the case in most of the case studies in the literature. This paper explains the need for such a system in Egypt, describes the research plan and the methodology to be followed during this study and demonstrates the results obtained so far from the achieved stages namely the state-of-the-art and the analysis of the current system of route <b>alignment</b> <b>planning</b> in GARBLT. ...|$|R

40|$|The Balloon Experimental Twin Telescope for Infrared Interferometry (BETTII) is an 8 -m {{baseline}} far-infrared (FIR: 30 90 micrometer) interferometer providing spatially resolved spectroscopy. The initial scientific {{focus of}} BETTII is on clustered star formation, but this capability likely {{has a much}} broader scientific application. One critical step in developing an interferometer, such as BETTII, is the optical alignment of the system. We discuss how we determine alignment sensitivities of different optical elements on the interferogram outputs. Accordingly, an <b>alignment</b> <b>plan</b> is executed that makes use of a laser tracker and theodolites for precise optical metrology of both the large external optics and the small optics inside the cryostat. We test our alignment on the ground by pointing BETTII to bright near-infrared sources and obtaining their images in the tracking detectors...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} start of the ground <b>alignment</b> <b>plan</b> for the SIM Lite Instrument. We outline the {{integration}} and alignment of the individual benches on which all the optics are mounted, and then the alignment of the benches to form the Science and Guide interferometers. The Instrument has a guide interferometer with only a 40 arc-seconds field of regard, and 200 arc-seconds of alignment adjustability. This requires each sides of the interferometer to be aligned to a fraction of that, {{while at the same time}} be orthogonal to the baseline defined by the External Metrology Truss. The baselines of the Science and Guide interferometers must also be aligned to be parallel. The start of these alignment plans is captured in a SysML 1 Instrument System model, in the form of activity diagrams. These activity diagrams are then related to the hardware design and requirements. We finish with future plans for the alignment and integration activities and requirements. 1...|$|E
