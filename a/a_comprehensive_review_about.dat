As such, it addresses eye care emphasizing the visual consequences of albinism along with diagnostic and treatment options. Methods: Background knowledge about ocular development is given {{as well as information}} about etiological biochemical and genetic processes. The current classification, clinical findings and their assessment and management options are presented based on recent results of research. In conclusion, two case reports are described as examples of visual care options. Results: Melanin plays a big role in the retinal and chiasmal development. Melanin biosynthesis can be disrupted by different genes in various ways which leads to the current classification of albinism. Clinical findings include fundus hypopigmenta-tion, nystagmus, iris transillumination, photophobia, foveal hypoplasia, excessive chiasmal decussation, reduced visual acuity, high astigmatism (with-the-rule), strabismus and decreased stereopsis. Treatment options to improve visual acuity, fixation and binocularity are (tinted) prescription lenses and contact lenses, low vision aids, surgical procedures and vision therapy. Medication and supplementa-tion for increased pigmentation are currently being tested on mice. Conclusions: Albinism is caused by genetic mutations resulting in ocular and cutaneous hypopigmentation.

Wear of the nozzle becomes {{a major problem}} since it may affect the water jet machining performance. Design, materials, and life of the nozzle give significance effect to the nozzle wear. There are various parameters that may influence the wear rate of the nozzle such as nozzle length, nozzle inlet angle, nozzle diameter, orifice diameter, abrasive flow rate and water pressure. The wear rate of the nozzle can be minimized by controlling these parameters. The mechanism of wear in the nozzle is similar to other traditional machining processes which uses a cutting tool. The high pressure {{of the water and}} hard abrasive particles may erode the nozzle wall.

The usual approach to tackle this requirement is to use on-board ranging sensors inside the vehicle. Radar, laser scanners or vision based systems are able to detect objects in their line-of-sight. In contrast to these non-cooperative ranging sensors, cooperative approaches follow a strategy in which other road participants actively support the estimation of the relative position. The limitations of on-board ranging sensors regarding their detection range and angle of view and the facility of blockage can be approached by using a cooperative approach based on vehicle-to-vehicle communication.
