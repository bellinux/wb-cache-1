500|$|Similar {{to most of}} {{the songs}} from Light Years, [...] "Spinning Around" [...] is a [...] "string-laden" [...] dance-pop track with {{prominent}} influences from disco music. According to the sheet music of the song published by BMG Rights Management at Musicnotes.com, it is composed in the key of F minor and features a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute. Minogue's vocal range spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of C5. <b>Addressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> of reinvention, the lyrics declare that Minogue has changed and learned from her past mistakes; it contains lines like [...] "I'm spinning around/Move out of my way... I'm not the same" [...] and [...] "Mistakes that I made have given me the strength to really believe." [...] In an analysis of the lyrics of the song, Pom Avoledo from Blogcritics wrote that Minogue demands attention in the chorus towards the changes in her personality and asserts that people appreciate them, in the line [...] "I know you're feelin me cause you like it like this." [...] The first verse deals with Minogue ridding herself of items and symbols from her past and starting afresh, evidenced in lines like [...] "Threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe." [...] The critic felt that in the second verse Minogue faces her mistakes and accepts herself as she is. The bridge of the song features the repetition of the hook [...] "You know you like it like this," [...] with Minogue's voice being vocoded. Chris True from AllMusic felt that through the lyrics, Minogue was admitting that releasing Impossible Princess in 1997 was not the best decision.|$|E

[...] "One word led to another," [...] Hank sings, [...] "and the last word led to divorce," [...] a line that would be all too prescient for the singer, who would be divorced from his wife Audrey Williams in 1951. Audrey actually cut the song for Decca five months before Williams recorded it, and the pair would perform the song as a two-part piece; Hank would narrate while Audrey would sing the little girl's part, what country music historian Colin Escott deems [...] "a rare occasion when her tuneless singing actually worked." [...] Williams cut his version in Nashville on August 31, 1950 with Fred Rose producing.

Many authors suggest that whilst certain emotions are exclusive to music (Scherer and Zentner, 2008), there is considerable overlap between “musical ” and “naturalistic ” emotions (Zentner et al., 2008); others deny that musically induced emotions are natu-ralistic (Konecni, 2005, 2008), a view elaborated by the nineteenth century criti...|$|E
