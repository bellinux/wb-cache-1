5|$|Ann Arbor {{was founded}} in 1824, named for wives of the village's founders and the stands of Bur Oak trees. The University of Michigan moved from Detroit to Ann Arbor in 1837, and the city grew at a rapid rate {{in the early to}} mid-20th century. During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a {{reputation}} as <b>a</b> <b>center</b> <b>for</b> left-wing politics.

5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>center</b> <b>for</b> {{trade and}} travel between the U.S., the Caribbean, and South America, South Florida is {{especially}} vulnerable to invasive species, or species {{of plants and animals}} that adapt aggressively to conditions in the Everglades, allowing them to reproduce faster and grow larger than they would naturally in their native environments. Approximately 26% of all species of fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals in South Florida are exotic—more than in any other part of the U.S.—and the region hosts one of the highest numbers of exotic plant species in the world. Controlling invasive species in 1,700,000 acres (6,900km2) of infested land in South Florida costs authorities about $500 million a year.|$|E
5|$|As a major {{industrial}} city into the mid-20th century, Omaha shared in social tensions of larger cities that accompanied rapid growth and many new immigrants and migrants. By the 1950s, Omaha was <b>a</b> <b>center</b> <b>for</b> illegal gambling, while experiencing dramatic job losses and unemployment because of dramatic {{restructuring of the}} railroads and the meatpacking industry, {{as well as other}} sectors. Persistent poverty resulting from racial discrimination and job losses generated different crimes in the late 20th century, with drug trade and drug abuse becoming associated with violent crime rates, which climbed after 1986 as Los Angeles gangs made affiliates in the city.|$|E
5|$|Athens became <b>a</b> <b>center</b> <b>for</b> {{music in}} the region during the Civil War and gained further fame {{in the early twentieth}} century with the {{founding}} of the Morton Theatre, which was a major touring destination for African American performers. The city's local rock music scene can be traced to the 1950s, with live music at Allen's Hamburgers in Normaltown. International attention came in the 1970s when the B-52's began releasing the first of several best-selling recordings. Athens-based rock bands have performed in a wide array of styles, and the city has never had a characteristic style of rock; most of the bands have been united only in their quirky and iconoclastic image.|$|E

5|$|Cho Ki-chon {{was born}} to poor Korean peasants {{in the village of}} Ael'tugeu in the Vladivostok District of the Russian Far East on 6 November 1913. The Pacific region of the Soviet Union, where he lived, was <b>a</b> <b>center</b> <b>for</b> Korean {{independence}} activists. He particularly drew literary inspiration from , a fellow Korean writer living in the Soviet Union who– in believing in national emancipation by upholding socialist principles– had already written about anti-Japanese guerillas. Thus he acquired a nationalistic and class conscious worldview in his literature.|$|E

5|$|Dallas and Fort Worth {{experienced}} one {{of their}} greatest oil-related construction booms in 1930 and 1931, when {{the opening of the}} East Texas oil field helped establish Dallas as the financial center for the oil industry in Texas and Oklahoma. New business offices and municipal buildings appeared in the city, including the Highland Park Village shopping center, one of the nation's earliest shopping malls. The Depression slowed population growth in the Dallas area somewhat during the later 1930s, but rapid growth patterns returned again during the 1940s. By this time, though, Dallas had already begun to rediversify, becoming <b>a</b> <b>center</b> <b>for</b> aircraft manufacturing and electronics technology in addition to a variety of other industries.|$|E

Today, the city remains an important distribution hub for companies such as Nestlé Purina PetCare, and is home to Lowell Observatory, The U.S. Naval Observatory, the United States Geological Survey Flagstaff Station, and Northern Arizona University. Flagstaff has a strong tourism sector, due to its proximity to Grand Canyon National Park, Oak Creek Canyon, the Arizona Snowbowl, Meteor Crater, and historic Route 66. The city is also <b>a</b> <b>center</b> <b>for</b> medical device manufacturing, since Flagstaff is home to W. L. Gore and Associates.|$|E

5|$|Grill {{established}} {{a small scale}} trade monopoly at Godegård in 1775. Before he became owner of the ironworks, the farmers around Godegård had refined the wrought iron from the factory into large quantities of nails using small trip hammers. The nails were sold in Askersund. As a trader Grill would not abide this. First he decreed that the farmers had to buy all their goods at the ironworks' general store. Second, he forbade the farmers and tenant farmers to sell nails to the merchants at Askersund, at that time <b>a</b> <b>center</b> <b>for</b> nail trade. In this way Grill assumed control over all nail trade himself.|$|E
5|$|Haifa's {{development}} owed much to British {{plans to}} make it a central port and hub for Middle-East crude oil. The British Government of Palestine developed the port and built refineries, thereby facilitating the rapid development of the city as <b>a</b> <b>center</b> <b>for</b> the country's heavy industries. Haifa was also among the first towns to be fully electrified. The Palestine Electric Company inaugurated the Haifa Electrical Power Station already in 1925, opening the door to considerable industrialization. The State-run Palestine Railways also built its main workshops in Haifa.|$|E
