5|$|Eugène's <b>artillery</b> {{continued}} to pound Russian support columns, while Marshals Ney and Davout {{set up a}} crossfire with <b>artillery</b> positioned on the Semyonovskaya heights. Barclay countered by moving the Prussian General Eugen over {{to the right to}} support Miloradovich in his defense of the redoubt. The French responded to this move by sending forward General Sorbier, commander of the Imperial Guard <b>artillery.</b> Sorbier brought forth 36 <b>artillery</b> pieces from the Imperial Guard <b>Artillery</b> Park and also took command of 49 horse <b>artillery</b> pieces from Nansouty's Ist Cavalry Corps and La Tour Maubourg's IV Cavalry Corps, as well as of Viceroy Eugène's own <b>artillery,</b> opening up a massive <b>artillery</b> barrage.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the war, the <b>artillery</b> worked {{independently}} and {{was taught to}} support the infantry {{to ensure a successful}} attack. In 1914, the heaviest <b>artillery</b> gun was the 60-pounder, four in each heavy battery. The Royal Horse <b>Artillery</b> employed the 13-pounder, while the Royal Field <b>Artillery</b> used the 18-pounder gun. By 1918, the situation had changed; the <b>artillery</b> were the dominant force on the battlefield. Between 1914 and 1918, the Royal Field <b>Artillery</b> had increased from 45 field brigades to 173 field brigades, while the heavy and siege <b>artillery</b> of the Royal Garrison <b>Artillery</b> had increased from 32 heavy and six siege batteries to 117 heavy and 401 siege batteries.|$|E

5|$|Between 13:00 and 14:00 General Bem amassed {{at least}} 64 <b>artillery</b> pieces {{on a narrow}} front near Forts 21, 22 and 23, and started firing on the <b>artillery</b> and {{infantry}} of the I Russian Corps. In the <b>artillery</b> barrage that lasted until 17:00, the forces of Russian I and II Corps were eventually forced to withdraw behind the ramparts of the captured forts. On several occasions the Russian cavalry of General Khilkov (including the Cuirassier Regiment) tried to charge the Polish <b>artillery</b> positions, but every time the charge was bloodily repelled with grapeshot and canister shot. Eventually the Russian cavalry withdrew from battle {{all the way to}} Górce. Half of the Russian <b>artillery</b> fought an intense <b>artillery</b> duel with the Poles, while the other half started shelling the suburb of Wola and Polish positions behind the second line of defences. Although the barrage prepared the field for yet another Polish counter-attack, Krukowiecki would not risk it.|$|E
5|$|Brigadier-General Edward Morrison {{developed}} and subsequently issued a 35-page multi-phased fire support plan called Canadian Corps <b>Artillery</b> Instruction No.1 for the Capture of Vimy Ridge {{to support the}} efforts of the infantry. For its operations, the Canadian Corps received three times the <b>artillery</b> normally assigned to a corps for regular operations. To manage the logistics associated with the increased <b>artillery,</b> Royal <b>Artillery</b> staff officer Major Alan Brooke developed coordinated communication and transport plans to work in conjunction with the complex barrage plans.|$|E
5|$|By 1771, {{there were}} 32 {{companies}} of the Royal <b>Artillery</b> in four battalions, {{as well as}} two Invalid Companies comprising older and unfit men employed in garrison duties. In January 1793, two troops of Royal Horse <b>Artillery</b> (RHA) were raised to provide fire support for the cavalry, joined by two more in November 1793. All RHA personnel were mounted. The Royal Irish <b>Artillery</b> was absorbed in 1801.|$|E

5|$|Edward I had {{the major}} {{ingredients}} for gunpowder shipped to Stirling in 1304, probably {{to produce a}} form of Greek fire, to be shot into the town in earthenware pots by siege engines. The English probably had projectile gunpowder <b>artillery</b> in the 1320s and the Scots by the next decade. The first clear recorded use in Britain was when Edward III besieged Berwick in 1333, where it was used alongside mechanical siege engines. The first use by the Scots was probably against Stirling Castle in 1341. Gunpowder <b>artillery</b> began to fully replace mechanical engines in the late fourteenth century. The Stewarts attempted to follow the French and English crowns in building up an <b>artillery</b> train. The abortive siege of Roxburgh in 1436 under James I was probably the first conflict in which the Scots made serious use of <b>artillery.</b> James II had a royal gunner and received gifts of <b>artillery</b> from the continent, including two giant bombards made for Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, one of which, Mons Meg, still survives. Although these were probably already outdated on the continent, they represented impressive military technology when they reached Scotland. James II enthusiasm for <b>artillery</b> cost him his life and demonstrated some {{of the dangers of}} early <b>artillery,</b> when a gun exploded at the siege of Roxburgh in 1460. James III also experienced ill-fortune, when <b>artillery</b> sent from Sigismund, Archduke of Austria sank in a storm en route to Scotland in 1481. James IV brought in experts from France, Germany and the Netherlands and established a foundry in 1511. Edinburgh Castle had a house of <b>artillery</b> where visitors could see cannon cast for what became a formidable train, allowing him to send cannon to France and Ireland and to quickly subdue Norham Castle in the Flodden campaign. However, his 18 heavy <b>artillery</b> pieces had to be drawn by 400 oxen and slowed the advancing Scots army, proving ineffective against the longer range and smaller calibre English guns at the Battle of Flodden.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, Morgan's battery departed for the Western Front in October 1914 as part of the 3rd (Lahore) Division. Morgan suffered a near-miss from a German 5.9-inch gun which blew him into the air and buried him in a shell hole, and he was evacuated to hospital in Boulogne with shell shock. He was granted a short sick leave in England only to be present when news reached his family that his brother had been killed in action. On returning to the front, Morgan became aide-de-camp to Brigadier General Edward Spencer Hoare-Nairne, the commander of the Lahore Divisional <b>Artillery.</b> The <b>artillery</b> remained on the Western Front when the bulk of the division departed for the Mesopotamian campaign. As it took longer to train <b>artillery</b> than infantry, the Lahore divisional <b>artillery</b> acted in turn as the <b>artillery</b> of the 2nd Canadian Division, 3rd Canadian Division, 4th Australian Division and finally the 4th Canadian Division until their own <b>artillery</b> was sufficiently trained to take over.|$|E
5|$|German {{infantry}} {{were spotted}} advancing towards the brigade box and were bombarded by heavy <b>artillery,</b> which repulsed the attack. Around 09:00, more infantry attacked {{the box and}} came too close for <b>artillery</b> fire. Hand-to-hand fighting began and a British platoon was overrun before a tank-infantry counter-attack repulsed the German infantry and restored the position. The Germans resorted to harassing fire, sniping, mortar bombardments and heavy <b>artillery</b> fire. After a long <b>artillery</b> bombardment, simultaneous attacks by tanks and infantry were made at 19:00, {{from the north and}} south, which broke into the box and closed on the brigade headquarters, before being driven back around 22:30.|$|E
5|$|His opponents {{learned from}} Napoleon's innovations. The {{increased}} importance of <b>artillery</b> after 1807 stemmed from his {{creation of a}} highly mobile <b>artillery</b> force, the growth in <b>artillery</b> numbers, and changes in <b>artillery</b> practices. As {{a result of these}} factors, Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defenses, now could use massed <b>artillery</b> as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line that was then exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry. McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on <b>artillery</b> by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and, later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers. Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th-century operational mobility underwent change.|$|E
5000|$|In the game, Russia {{starts out}} with 36 infantries and 13 <b>artilleries</b> after setup to {{represent}} the inferiority of its soldiers, Germany has 63 infantries and 23 <b>artilleries,</b> and Austria-Hungary begins with 48 infantries and 12 <b>artilleries.</b> [...] This would indicate that both Germany and Austria-Hungary had vastly more forces. However, in actuality, in 1914, Russia had 5,971,000 soldiers, Germany had 4,500,000, and Austria-Hungary had 3,000,000. [...] In the game, if the respective sides were allocated proportional numbers of soldiers as to real life, Russia would be at a disadvantage against the Central Powers and ruin {{the balance of the}} game for the two sides. The game had to be playable and fun, and as a result was made to be more balanced that the situation was in history.|$|R

5|$|However, {{the rifle}} corps were re-established in late 1942 and the {{previous}} organization of <b>artillery</b> at the corps level was reintroduced. As {{a result of the}} halting of 152mm howitzer production, the Red Army corps <b>artillery</b> lacked a weapon more mobile than the heavy 152 mm howitzer-gun M1937 (ML-20) (typically employed by army-level and Reserve of the Main Command <b>artillery</b> units), but more powerful than the 122 mm howitzer M1938 (M-30).|$|E
5|$|II Napoleon {{ordered the}} {{assemblage}} of over 5,000 <b>artillery</b> for transport through the pass, {{despite the fact}} that the pass was widely considered to be much too narrow, and the route too volatile and unstable, to allow any form of <b>artillery,</b> light or heavy, to come through. Thus, Napoleons military advisers warned him against this move, but he insisted on this presence of this great number of <b>artillery.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the renewed NVA <b>artillery</b> fire, on 30 May, 4 M107s and 4 M110s were deployed to KSCB from Camp Carroll and these engaged in a 48-hour <b>artillery</b> barrage named Operation Drumfire II against suspected NVA <b>artillery</b> positions in the Co Roc Range, with little noticeable effect.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 13 May, the 10th Panzer Division slipped into {{position}} upstream to the north-east of Sedan, ready to strike at its designated crossing point near the town of Wadelincourt. Downstream, the 2nd Panzer Division moved into position to cross at Donchery. The 1st Panzer Division prepared to strike at the Gaulier bridgehead, in the centre of Sedan's tactical front. It was on the northern bend of the Sedan Meuse loop that the Luftwaffe was to make its maximum effort, between Gaulier and Wadelincourt. To supplement his air support, Guderian stripped most of his Panzer Divisions of their <b>artillery,</b> which he then positioned directly opposite Gaulier. However, the <b>artillery</b> regiments lacked ammunition. Sustained and damaging bombardment through shelling was impossible. The Luftwaffe {{was going to have to}} do most of the work. Guderian reported that his Corps had only 141 <b>artillery</b> pieces against the French 174. To the north and south of Sedan, the French X Corps and French XXXXI Corps (at the <b>artillery</b> fortress at Charleville-Mézières) could also add their <b>artillery</b> and shell Guderian's Panzer units as they crossed the bridgeheads. The slow advance of <b>artillery</b> units to the front added to the German numerical inferiority, which was now 1:3 against. Only in the afternoon did the German <b>artillery</b> make an appearance, but with little effect. The 2nd Panzer Division was forced to attack without <b>artillery</b> support. For these reasons, Guderian had decided the outcome depended on the quality of air support, acting as flying <b>artillery.</b>|$|E
