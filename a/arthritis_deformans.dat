A famous friend of Corti's father, Antonio Scarpa, may have kindled his boyhood {{interest}} in anatomy and medicine. As a medical student he enrolled first at the University of Pavia. Corti's favorite study there was microanatomy with Bartolomeo Panizza and Mario Rusconi. In 1845, against paternal wishes, Corti moved to Vienna to complete his medical studies and {{to work in the}} anatomical institute of Joseph Hirtl. There he received the degree in medicine in 1847 under the supervision of professor Hyrtl, with a thesis on the bloodstream system of a reptile. He was then appointed by Hyrtl to be his Second Prosector. With the outbreak of the 1848 Revolution he left Vienna, and after brief military service in Italy made visits to eminent scientists in Bern, London and Paris. At the beginning of 1850 Corti had received the invitation of the anatomist Albert Kölliker and had moved to Würzburg, where he made friends with Virchow. At the Kölliker Laboratory he began to work on the mammalian auditory system. Corti spent a short time in Utrecht, where he visited Professors Jacobus Schroeder van der Kolk and Pieter Harting. During his stay he learned to use methods to preserve several preparations of the cochlea. From Utrecht he returned to Würzburg to complete his study of at least 200 cochleas of man and different animals. His famous paper, [...] "Recherches sur l'organe de l'ouïe des mammiferes", appeared in 1851 in Kölliker's journal [...] "Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Zoologie". In the same year, {{after the death of his}} father, he inherited his father's estate and the title [...] "Marchese de San Stefano Belbo" [...] and moved back to Italy. In 1855 Corti married the daughter from a neighboring estate, Maria Bettinzoli. His young wife presented him with a daughter Bianca, and a son Gaspare, but in 1861 she died, leaving him with the responsibility of rearing the children. Unfortunately he was gradually developing <b>arthritis</b> <b>deformans.</b> Corti's last 15 years were further darkened by the inexorable progress of his crippling illness. In 1876, on the second of October, he died at Corvino San Quirico.|$|E
40|$|Most Byzantine medical texts {{described}} the rheumatic diseases. The Byzantine physicians, {{based on the}} ancient Greek texts, explained the causes of rheumatic diseases, {{described the}}ir symptoms and proposed certain treatments. The Byzantine medical sources described various types of rheumatic diseases, as inflammatory <b>arthritis,</b> chronic <b>deformans</b> polyarthritis, and gout. As {{it can be concluded}} by the available medical sources, during the Byzantine period rheumatic diseases constituted a serious medical and social problem, reprenting a remarkable cause of disability, and this complaint was part of the epidemiological interest of the Byzantine physicians...|$|R
40|$|Degenerative {{joint disease}} of the {{vertebral}} column can be divided in two types of degeneration. First there is degeneration of the intervertebral joints resulting in osteophyte formation, named spondylosis deformans. Second there is degeneration of the synovial facet articulations between vertebrae, named osteoarthritis. There are a few reports of spondylosis deformans in cats, but no reports of osteoarthritis of the facet articulations of the vertebral column. This literature review describes what is currently known about these two conditions considering prevalence, pathogenesis, clinical symptoms, diagnostic possibilities, radiographic symptoms and therapeutical options. Evaluation of the prevalence of osteoarthritis in the facet articulations of the vertebral column and spondylosis deformans of the vertebral column on radiographs from {{the archives of the}} Division of Diagnostic Imaging of the University Clinic for Companion Animals in Utrecht was performed. In total, 471 radiographs were evaluated for facet <b>arthritis</b> and spondylosis <b>deformans.</b> For each case the age, breed, weight, gender and disease for which the cat was presented were assessed. This research was done to learn more about risk factors and prevalence of facet osteoarthritis and spondylosis deformans in cats referred to the university clinic in the Netherlands. Frequency tables were made of all assessed variables. Logistic regression was performed per intervertebral space to evaluate putative risk factors (i. e. breed, gender, age, weight, trauma and diagnosis) in the development of spondylosis deformans in cats. Also prevalence of spondylosis per intervertebral space was calculated. Spondylosis deformans was related to age in most intervertebral spaces. An older cat has increased odds for having spondylosis than a younger cat. Spondylosis at two intervertebral spaces was related to gender. A female neutered cat has higher odds of developing spondylosis, compared to a male neutered cat. Spondylosis at one intervertebral space was related to weight. Occurrence of spondylosis was not related to disease and breed. Least spondylosis was found in the cervical region of the spine, and somewhat more was found in the lumbar region of the spine. Most spondylosis was found in the thoracic region of the spine with a peak incidence between Th 5 -Th 10. Most bridges were seen in the late-thoracic and early-lumbar part (Th 10 -L 2) of the spine. Early-to-middle thoracic region (Th 1 -Th 10) was most frequently affected by small spurs and tooth-like shapes. Of the 471 evaluated radiographs, only six cats were found positive for facet osteoarthritis over some intervertebral spaces...|$|R
40|$|Researches of biomechanical {{parameters}} of gait {{are carried out}} at flatfoot, <b>arthritis</b> <b>deformans</b> and consequences of fractures of the lower extremities by an accelerography (study group consisted of 2988 persons). The method is applicable for studying push functions of the lower extremities - sharpness. Results are issued {{in the form of}} the table push the accelerations registered in various sites of a body in norm and at flatfoot. The gait accelerograms are presented in norm and at consequences of fractures and <b>arthritis</b> <b>deformans.</b> The analysis of results is carried out. The most informative biomechanics {{parameters of}} gait are allocated: angular speed for joints (hailstones/sek); acceleration angular and linear - for muscles (m/sek 2); sharpness - for bones (m/sek 3). Besides in conclusions amortization functions of the spring arch of foot and muscles of feet and a backbone are reflected, at a pathology directed on decrease push loadings on a head and a brain that is especially appreciable at expressed flatfoot. Thus the biomechanics of movements of a head integrity reflects all set compensative and the adaptive phenomena in locomotors system at a pathology and is an informative indicator of locomotion symmetry Locomotion character makes considerable impact on head and brain biomechanics in norm and at a pathology...|$|E
40|$|Phenolcamphor {{has been}} used for {{prevention}} of infection and for treatment of injury and suppurative inflammation of knee joint since the World War Ⅰ. Effects of Phenolcamphor in joint, especially regarding its corrosive action, were studied. Anatomical changes developing in joint were studied macroscopically and histologically by means of Hematoxylin-Eosin and PAS stain in two groups of rabbits in which 0. 25 cc and 0. 5 cc of Phenolcamphor were injected into knee joint, respectively. 1) Phenolcamphor properly prepared after original method neither produces necrosis of synovial membrane and articular cartilage nor has corrosive action. 2) Phenolcamphor must be carefully injected, for <b>arthritis</b> <b>deformans</b> would be caused by technical error, and its possibility is enhanced by presence of injury of articular cartilage. 3) Effects of Phenolcamphor continues so that persistent congestion is present in synovial membrane, and dilatation of small vessels, round cell infiltration and hyperplasia of connective tissue are histologically barely noticeable. A small amonnt of serous exudate accumulates, however, neither adhesion nor functional disturbances are produced...|$|E
40|$|<b>Arthritis</b> <b>deformans</b> in its {{atrophic form}} (rheumatoid arthritis) is, perhaps, best {{defined as a}} chronic disease {{affecting}} many joints, principally the smaller ones. It occurs chiefly in the female sex, is due probably to the action of a toxin, and is characterised by changes in the cartilages and the soft structures surrounding the joints, thus causing great immobility and deformity. That arthritis is a disease of great antiquity is {{borne out by the}} fact that recently-unearthed bones from tombs of about 3700 - 1300 B. C. showed unmistakable evidence of the affection. In exarnination of remains in Egypt, remains representative of all periods from early predynastic times dovm to the Fifth Dynasty after Christ, "the disease which showed itself with by far the greatest frequency in the bodies of all periods is rheumatoid arthritis". Virchow has left records describing the affection in bones unearthed from Pompeii. From these remote times onwards through the Middle Ages to the present day, an almost continuous series of historical records testifies that the disease has always been with us, and also that its clinical characters have remained unaltered through all the ages. The aetiology and pathology of the disease have, however, been so shrouded in darkness that we find the various writers, in their information on the subject, making indiscriminate use of the terms rheumatism, gout and arthritis to designate this affection...|$|E
