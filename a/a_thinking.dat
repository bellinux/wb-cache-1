5|$|Descartes' famous {{argument}} for this position {{can be summarized}} as follows: Seth has a clear and distinct idea of his mind as <b>a</b> <b>thinking</b> thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be {{measured in terms of}} length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.|$|E

25|$|Wilfred Bion: According to Bion, {{thoughts}} precede <b>a</b> <b>thinking</b> capacity. Thoughts {{in a small}} infant are {{indistinguishable from}} sensory data or unorganised emotion. Bion uses the term proto-thoughts for these early phenomena. Because of their connection to sensory data, proto-thoughts are concrete and self-contained (thoughts-in-themselves), not yet capable of symbolic representations or object relations. The thoughts then function as preconceptions – predisposing psychosomatic entities similar to archetypes. Support for this connection comes from the Kleinian analyst Money-Kyrle's observation that Bion's notion of preconceptions is the direct descendant of Plato's Ideas.|$|E

25|$|Descartes {{explains}} how {{he made a}} mention of the two questions, the existence of God, and the soul, in his Discourse on Method. Following this, he received objections, {{and two of them}} he considers are of importance. The first is how he concludes that the essence of the soul is a thing that thinks, excluding all other nature. To this he says that he has a clear perception that he is <b>a</b> <b>thinking</b> thing, and has no other clear perception, and from this he concludes that there is nothing else in the essence of the self.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after arrival}} at Munich in 1913, where Bruno Walter (from Vienna) had succeeded Mottl, Erb {{appeared}} as Loge in Das Rheingold. He completely rethought the part, dispensing with Briesemeister's flaming and dancing impersonation. Walter realised he was <b>a</b> <b>thinking</b> artist, and the Press had 'not {{seen such a}} Loge since Bayreuth'. He sang this role (his 42nd) for 12 years at the Munich Festivals. In a September 1913 double-bill Caruso sang Canio at Munich but left Turiddu to Erb. He now sang Erik, Tannhäuser, Loge, Pinkerton and Cavaradossi. His dramatic skills were admired as Achilles in Gluck's Iphigeneia in Aulis, and he sang Graf Adolar in Weber's Euryanthe. In 1914, when Parsifal was first freely given in Germany, {{he was the first}} Munich Parsifal, bringing spiritual and religious insight.|$|E

But it went deeper than McNamara's comments. Bailey had made mistakes in his career. He hadn't made enough first-class runs. He hadn't come into the team as a young man.

Varaha in verse 2.64 compares the [...] "samsara" [...] (cycle of rebirth) to the domain of karma, states Billington, one that is like a long dream ("swapna"), a delusion, a sea of sorrow. It defines jivanmukta as someone who has overcome and attained liberation from this samsara through self-knowledge.|$|E

Knowledge Management has become an important process which could help companies to accumulate the knowledge created in the past, {{and use it to}} solve the current problem and for future use. Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) has been widely implemented as a technique for identifying potential problems, whilst <b>A</b> 3 <b>Thinking,</b> has been developed by Toyota as a tool to help solve problems. However, no research exists regarding integrating these strategies for the purposes of knowledge creation, capturing and provision. This research focuses on integrating <b>an</b> <b>A</b> 3 <b>Thinking</b> Template and FMEA-based Failure Documentation which will be used to document the problem, solve the problem, allowing knowledge creation, capturing and provision. The objectives are to: (1) Synthesise the good practices of using FMEA and <b>A</b> 3 <b>thinking</b> through <b>a</b> literature review; (2) Analyse the role and capability of FMEA and <b>A</b> 3 <b>thinking</b> in capturing and communicating knowledge to support the generation of an improved design solution; (3) Design an integration between FMEA-based Failure Documentation and the <b>A</b> 3 <b>Thinking</b> template for problem solving during the design stage to support knowledge visualisation and capturing in a dynamic manner; Then develop a checklist to present the knowledge captured; (4) Validate the integration via case study on product development process in collaborating company. The proposed integration of FMEA-based Failure Documentation and <b>A</b> 3 <b>Thinking</b> template has 3 stages. Firstly, problems will be documented into FMEA-based Failure Documentation template. Secondly, the <b>A</b> 3 <b>Thinking</b> template with its procedure will enable users to follow the instructions to find out the solution and correct the problem.

500|$|At {{national}} {{level in the}} UK, Mosley competed in over 40 races in 1966 and 1967; he won 12 and set several class lap records. In 1968, he formed the London Racing Team in partnership with driver Chris Lambert to compete in European Formula Two, which {{at that time was}} the level of racing just below Formula One. Their cars were prepared by Frank Williams, later a Formula One team owner. It was a dangerous time to race. Mosley's first Formula Two race was the 1968 Deutschland Trophäe, at Hockenheim in which double world champion Jim Clark was killed, and within two years both of Mosley's 1968 team mates, Piers Courage and Chris Lambert were dead in racing accidents. Mosley's best result that year was an eighth place at a non-championship race at Monza. Engine builder Brian Hart says that as a driver, Mosley [...] "might not have been particularly quick, but he was <b>a</b> <b>thinking</b> driver.

500|$|Among {{art historians}} and critics, Ruisdael's {{reputation}} {{has had its}} ups and downs over the centuries. The first account, in 1718, is from Houbraken, who waxed lyrical over the technical mastery which allowed Ruisdael to realistically depict falling water and the sea. In 1781, Sir Joshua Reynolds, founder of the Royal Academy, admired the freshness and force of Ruisdael's landscapes. A couple of decades later other English critics were less impressed. In 1801, Henry Fuseli, professor at the Royal Academy, expressed his contempt for the entire Dutch School of Landscape, dismissing it as no more than a [...] "transcript of the spot", a mere [...] "enumeration of hill and dale, clumps of trees". Of note is that one of Fuseli's students was Constable, whose admiration for Ruisdael remained unchanged. Around the same time in Germany, the writer, statesman and scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe lauded Ruisdael as <b>a</b> <b>thinking</b> artist, even a poet, saying [...] "he demonstrates remarkable skill in locating the exact point at which the creative faculty comes into contact with a lucid mind". John Ruskin however, in 1860, raged against Ruisdael and other Dutch Golden Age landscapists, calling their landscapes places where [...] "we lose not only all faith in religion but all remembrance of it". In 1915, the Dutch art historian Abraham Bredius called his compatriot not so much a painter as a poet.|$|E
