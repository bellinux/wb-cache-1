40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} public {{adaptation to climate change}} using <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> <b>schemes</b> in South American farms. Unlike other studies of adaptation, this paper examines the differences between private irrigation and public irrigation schemes based on around 1400 farm surveys collected across seven countries in South America which recorded detailed water schemes. We analyze the choice of water schemes in the first stage and the land values for each scheme in the second stage. We find that public irrigations do not increase in response to a warmer climate, but private irrigations do. On the other hand, we find that public irrigation schemes are provided primarily as a response to water scarcity. Moreover, we find that private irrigations are taken gradually while public irrigations are provided as a lump sum, resulting in either {{too much or too little}} provision. Therefore, public adaptations to climate change will likely involve two inefficiencies. No provision of irrigation in a hotter climate may result from a lack of knowledge. Overprovision of irrigation in dry zones may result from a lump-sum provision of a public good. Climate change Public adaptation Irrigation South America...|$|E
40|$|For {{this study}} the Plaichumpol Irrigation Project (PIP) {{which is an}} area that relies heavily on conjunctive water use was {{selected}} to study water demand, supply and actual use for the purpose of providing possible guidelines for optimal water exploitation. Groundwater models are applied to the study area to mimic the interaction between farmer’s irrigation behaviour and hydrological process. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>water</b> allocation <b>schemes</b> are examined by the models to fit the local weather conditions and the regional management rules. The simulation provides adaptation guidelines of conjunctive water use, according to optimal water utilization and based on proper management. The seasonal interaction indicates that the irrigation canals recharge water to the aquifer during the wet and dry seasons, but only during the wet season the latter contributes small amounts of water to the canals. The relationship between canal recharge and water level is significant for the understanding of the rise of the groundwater table in dry seasons, and it should be developed further for use in canal water regulations to keep up the groundwater levels. This study puts forward the groundwater potential in the conjunctive use which farmers have available during periods of shortage so that, eventually, the water assurance is increased and more annual crops are possible...|$|R
40|$|Water is an {{important}} element in agricultural production. The recent population growth, rapid urbanization, and fast industrialization present increasing challenges for China's <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> use. Embodied water has been promoted as a substantial indicator for the assessment of water consumption induced by human activities. However, few studies have investigated the dynamic change in embodied <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> use by time-series data. The findings of such studies may facilitate the development of comprehensive sustainable water-usage strategies. Thus, this study quantifies the embodied <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> trade, as and tertiary industries. China has always been a net exporter of <b>agricultural</b> <b>water.</b> At the industrial level, the primary industry is a net importer because of the increasing food demand in China, the secondary industry has consistently been a net exporter, and the tertiary industry has maintained a trade balance. The production- and consumption-based embodied <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> uses demonstrate similar changing trends: both decrease from 1997 to 2007 and then significantly increase in 2010. The embodied <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> consumed by the primary industry shows a downward trend, whereas those consumed by the secondary and tertiary industries demonstrate an opposite trend. Therefore, in addition to the improvement of <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> efficiency, adjustments in consumption and trade structure are highly instrumental to the conservation of local <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> resources. well as production- and consumption-based <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> footprints in China by using an input-output model during 1997 - 2010.

As aquifers become depleted, the buffer function can be replaced by other local <b>water</b> supply <b>schemes.</b> However, if groundwater is mainly used to augment total water supply, the only replacement is long-distance supply schemes that may not be economically desirable. This study used Namibian farm price data to estimate implicit water values. The results are consistent with a buffer function for groundwater, but do not show conclusively that this function is more important than other functions. On precautionary principles, one should therefore assume that it will become necessary to decrease <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> use as aquifers become depleted. ...|$|R

30|$|National {{policies}} {{aimed at}} allocating water resources among different sectors vary significantly between countries. Governments control water supplies in many countries. These countries typically do not allocate {{water on the}} basis of the economic efficiency but instead use other criteria such as fairness or equity. Due to many reasons (but especially to promote crops), governments tend to favor the agricultural sector. In Iran, the proportion of <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> in the total consumption of water is high. About 95 % of usable water resources in Iran are allocated to the agricultural sector. Planning the optimal use of water for a country such as Iran that contains arid and semi-arid regions is therefore important. The low price of <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> and the subsidies provided by the government for using this resource results in a little incentive to conserve it or to refrain from growing water-intensive crops. The price of <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> is far below its economic value.

Using fieldwork data from 577 farmers and 20 water managers in Sichuan, we explore farmers’ information processing regarding paying <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> fees via three sequential mental accounting processes, with the associated underlying principles and measures behind each process.
