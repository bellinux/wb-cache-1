5000|$|The adjacent-channel {{interference}} which receiver A experiences from a transmitter B {{is the sum}} of {{the power}} that B emits into A's channel—known as the [...] "unwanted emission", and represented by the ACLR (Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio)—and the power that A picks up from B's channel, which is represented by the ACS (<b>Adjacent</b> <b>Channel</b> <b>Selectivity).</b> B emitting power into A's channel is called adjacent-channel leakage (unwanted emissions). It occurs for two reasons. First, because RF filters require a roll-off, and do not eliminate a signal completely. Second, due to intermodulation in B's amplifiers, which cause the transmitted spectrum to spread beyond what was intended. Therefore, B emits some power in the adjacent channel which is picked up by A. A receives some emissions from B's channel due to the roll off of A's selectivity filters. Selectivity filters are designed to [...] "select" [...] a channel. Similarly, B's signal suffers intermodulation distortion passing through A's RF input amplifiers, leaking more power into adjacent frequencies.|$|E

40|$|Recent atttempts {{to reduce}} the cost and size of {{wireless}} transceivers feature higher levels of transistor integration in alternative architectures {{to reduce the}} need for the off-chip, high-Q passives used in present-day super-heterodyne transceivers. Unfortunately, removal of off-chip passives often comes at the cost of increased power consumption in circuits preceding and including the analog-todigital converter (ADC), which must have higher dynamic ranges to avoid desensitization caused by larger <b>adjacent</b> <b>channel</b> interferers. A <b>selectivity</b> (Q) versus power trade-off is seen here. This device makes possible a paradigm-shifting transceiver architecture that, rather than eliminate high-Q passive components, attempts to maximize their role with the intention of harnessing the above Q versus power trade-off.

30|$|In this section, we {{analyze the}} {{adjacent}} channel interference ratio (ACIR) {{as a good}} metric used {{for the assessment of}} the ratio of wanted power to the interference power from the other bands. Mathematically, ACIR is the function of the adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR, used to characterize the transmitter) and the <b>adjacent</b> <b>channel</b> <b>selectivity</b> (ACS, used to characterize the receiver), i.e., ACIR = 1 /ACLR^- 1 + ACS^- 1. In our case, it is calculated as a ratio of FD signal power at the BS RX antenna to the summarized power of interfering signal observed over 12 subcarriers utilized by a given PUCCH channel at the output of FFT block in SC-OFDM receiver.

40|$|Abstract—The {{life time}} of RF front end in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is so {{important}} that it decides whether the whole system can work normally for a long time. Under CMOS technology, Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) {{is one of the}} most important factors that decide chips ’ life time. Especially with the feature size declining, NBTI effect is becoming more and more serious. Previous works mainly focus on NBTI effect at device level, or NBTI effect in large-scale digital circuits. In this paper, for the WSN node, we study the NBTI impact on the front-end circuits, such as Voltage-Controlled Oscillators (VCO), Charge Pump (CP), Low Noise Amplifier (LNA), and the whole transceiver system. The circuit level NBTI degeneration models are built for the key modules and the entire transceiver. The mathematical models can be summarized into a conclusion that the phase noise of the VCO will deteriorate, the current mismatch of the CP and the noise figure of the LNA will both increase, and then the sensitivity and <b>Adjacent</b> <b>Channel</b> <b>Selectivity</b> (ACS) will be depressed by NBTI.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{procedure}} is to evaluate potential interference involving Fixed and/or Mobile stations in the 162 - 174 MHz and 406. 1 - 420 MHz bands. The propagation portion of the discussion {{was derived from the}} Longley-Rice Model (1968). Certain assumptions {{have been made in the}} propagation calculations for ease of presentation and use. In all cases, the assumptions used will result in conservative estimates of propagation loss, i. e., the actual interfering signal level should be less than that predicted.

40|$|One of the {{purposes}} of receive filtering in a Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) handset receiver is to attenuate out-of-channel interference to provide channel selectivity. A UMTS handset receiver using a receive filter adaptive on out-of-channel interfer- ence level can be more computationally efficient than a handset with a fixed receive filter provided that the hand- set operates in low out-of-channel interference conditions often enough. The UMTS <b>Adjacent</b> <b>Channel</b> <b>Selectivity</b> (ACS) test case requires the adaptive receive filter to pro- vide a worst case ACS of 33 dB. An adaptive receive filter is more computationally efficient than a fixed receive fil- ter when the required ACS is less than 23 dB, because the added complexity of measuring the out-of-channel interfer- ence is compensated for by the reduction in the required number of filter taps to achieve the ACS. Measurements of the out-of-channel interference show that currently the interference levels for which the maximum ACS of 33 dB is required are hardly ever reached in practice. For the currently measured interference levels an adaptive receive filter will be computationally more efficient than a fixed receive filter 97 % of the time. However, the current out-of-channel interference mea- surements might be on the optimistic side, because the loads of the UMTS networks are low. When these loads in- crease in the future, the out-of-channel interference levels may increase and the advantage in computational efficiency of the adaptive receive filter will be reduced...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop {{calculation}} methods for estimating the most important system level performance characteristics of the WCDMA radio network (i. e. network capacity and coverage) in the presence of interference from various sources. The calculation methods described in this work enable the fast design of radio systems with a reasonable degree of accuracy, where different system parameters, propagation conditions and networks as well as frequency scenarios can be easily tested. The work also includes the development and verification of a propagation model for a microcellular environment. Traditionally, system level performance figures have been retrieved using system simulations where the radio network has been modeled as accurately as possible. This has included base stations and mobile stations, propagation models, traffic models and mobility models. Various radio resource management (RRM) algorithms, such as power controls and handovers have also been modeled. However, these system simulations are very complex and time consuming and typically the models are difficult to modify. The idea behind this work is to use the main statistical parameters retrieved from accurate, case specific propagation models and to use these statistics as input for the developed analytical radio network models. When used as output from these analytical models we are able to obtain the performance measures of the network. The specific application area for the developed methods is the evaluation of the effect of the interference from the adjacent frequency channels. Adjacent channel interference decreases the efficiency of the usage of the electromagnetic spectrum i. e. the spectral efficiency. The aim of a radio system design is to ensure that the reduction in the spectral efficiency is as low as possible. This interference may originate from the same or a different radio system and from the same or another operator's network. The strength of this interference is dependent on the system parameters and the network layout. The standard questions regarding adjacent system interference between different operators' network are what guard band is needed between the radio carriers in order to maintain the quality of the network or what are the main mobile and network parameters, such as adjacent channel emission levels or <b>adjacent</b> <b>channel</b> <b>selectivity,</b> required in order to achieve satisfactory network performance. With the developed method proposed here it is possible to answer these questions with reasonable accuracy. One important aspect of network performance is the radio wave propagation environment for which the radio systems are designed. This thesis presents methods evaluating radio wave propagation, especially for cases where the base station antenna is below the rooftops, i. e. in the case of microcellular network environments. The developed microcellular propagation model has been developed for network planning purposes and it has been verified using numerous field propagation measurements. The model can be used in cases where the mobile station is located either indoors or outdoors. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Wireless {{networks}} in <b>adjacent</b> frequency <b>channels</b> can interfere each other. In this report {{it has been}} investigated how this interference can be minimized for the 2. 6 GHz frequency band. The Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs intends to issue begin 2008 spectrum licenses for this band. A good method to minimize interference is a Block Edge Mask (BEM). A BEM dictates the maximum transmit power in the awarded frequency spectrum. In practical systems {{it is nearly impossible}} to transmit only in the awarded spectrum. A small part of the transmit power is transmitted in <b>adjacent</b> frequency <b>channels</b> and also receivers have limited <b>channel</b> <b>selectivity.</b> For this reason, a BEM not only dictates the maximum in-band transmit power, but also defines the maximum transmit power outside the awarded frequency spectrum. An important parameter for constructing the BEM is frequency efficiency. The 3 GPP standards and the proposals of other countries have been used as a starting point. There are two frequency bands where spectrum licenses will be issued, 2010 to 2019. 7 MHz and 2500 – 2690 MHz...|$|R
