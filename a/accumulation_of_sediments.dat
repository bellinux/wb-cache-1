25|$|The Far North is {{the area}} between the {{northern}} boundary {{of the country and}} the parallel 26Â° S, covering the first three regions. It is characterized by the presence of the Atacama desert, the most arid in the world. The desert is fragmented by streams that originate in the area known as the pampas Tamarugal. The Andes, split in two and whose eastern arm runs Bolivia, has a high altitude and volcanic activity, which has allowed the formation of the Andean altiplano and salt structures as the Salar de Atacama, due to the gradual <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> over time.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture {{contributes}} {{greatly to}} soil erosion and sediment deposition through intensive management or inefficient land cover. It {{is estimated that}} agricultural land degradation is leading to an irreversible decline in fertility on about 6 million ha of fertile land each year. The <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> (i.e. sedimentation) in runoff water affects water quality in various ways. Sedimentation can decrease the transport capacity of ditches, streams, rivers, and navigation channels. It can also {{limit the amount of}} light penetrating the water, which affects aquatic biota. The resulting turbidity from sedimentation can interfere with feeding habits of fishes, affecting population dynamics. Sedimentation also affects the transport and accumulation of pollutants, including phosphorus and various pesticides.|$|E
2500|$|The Dox Formation is {{a complex}} {{sequence}} of marine, coastal, estuarine, and fluvial mud-dominated deposits that represent deposition at the prograding margin of the Unkar Basin. The Escalante Creek and Solomon Temple members preserve the record of fluvial, estuarine, and deltaic sedimentation. The contact between the underlying Shinumo Quartzite and the Dox formation represents a change from the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> in nearshore marine and coastal environments, to the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> in terrestrial floodplains and river channels. The Escalante Creek Member consists of sediments that were deposited in shallow river channels, which were as wide as [...] and [...] deep. Numerous stacked sandstone channels can be observed just above Unkar Rapid (River Mile 73) and within side drainages between River Miles 65 and 73.

2500|$|Many ports, urban conglomerations, and {{agricultural}} regions {{are built on}} river deltas, where subsidence of land contributes to a substantially increased effective sea level rise. [...] This is caused by both unsustainable extraction of groundwater (in some place also by extraction of oil and gas), and by levees and other flood management practices that prevent <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> from compensating for the natural settling of deltaic soils. In many deltas this results in subsidence ranging from several millimeters per year up to possibly 25 centimeters per year {{in parts of the}} Ciliwung delta (Jakarta). Total anthropogenic-caused subsidence in the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta (Netherlands) is estimated at 3 to 4 meters, over 3 meters in urban areas of the Mississippi River Delta (New Orleans), and over nine meters in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.|$|E

5000|$|The {{final and}} longest phase is the {{continued}} thermal subsidence of the transitional crust and the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediments.</b> Continued seafloor spreading {{leads to the}} formation of oceanic crust of normal thickness.

50|$|Upright fossils {{typically}} {{occur in}} layers {{associated with an}} actively subsiding coastal plain or rift basin, or with the accumulation of volcanic material around a periodically erupting stratovolcano. Typically, this period of rapid sedimentation {{was followed by a}} period of time - decades to thousands of years long - characterized by very slow or no <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediments.</b> In river deltas and other coastal-plain settings, rapid sedimentation is often the end result of a brief period of accelerated subsidence of an area of coastal plain relative to sea level caused by salt tectonics, global sea-level rise, growth faulting, continental margin collapse, or some combination of these factors. For example, geologists such as John W. F. Waldron and Michael C. Rygel have argued that the rapid burial and preservation of polystrate fossil trees found at Joggins, Nova Scotia directly result from rapid subsidence, caused by salt tectonics within an already subsiding pull-apart basin, and from the resulting rapid <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediments.</b> The specific layers containing polystrate fossils occupy only a very limited fraction of the total area of any of these basins.|$|E
50|$|The coastal levee is {{the result}} of the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> of the Parana River on the shore; it is low rise, not higher than the 3 meter canyon, and is bounded on the east by the river and on the west by {{residual}} lagoons from former water channels. Its width does not exceed 250 meters, while the built portion covers about 600 meters long. Some fields are cultivated in the low semi-permanent floodplains.|$|E

50|$|The {{northern}} part of the Gulf of Salwah is restricted by coral reefs and <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediment.</b> This results in the Gulf having a very small tidal range (around 0.5 m) and a high salinity, as water evaporates from the surface and the remaining water is not exchanged with less-saline water.|$|R
5000|$|The molasse can {{sometimes}} completely fill a foreland basin, creating a nearly flat depositional surface, that nonetheless remains a structural syncline.

50|$|By {{the time}} Taiwan was ceded to Japan {{following}} {{the end of}} the Sino-Japanese War in 1895, Tamsui's position as a seaport was beginning to wane due to the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> in the Tamsui River. By the 20th century, most of Tamsui's port operations had moved to Keelung, and the local economy had switched primarily to agriculture. However, public infrastructure construction projects by the Japanese led to Tamsui's rise as a local administrative and cultural center.|$|E
50|$|The Old Drift landscapes were tundras or cold deserts {{during the}} last ice age. Periglacial {{processes}} resulted in significant ablation of higher terrain as well as <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> in the depressions. As {{a result of that}} the old glacial forms have clearly been worn down. In addition almost all closed hollows (e. g. dead ice kettle holes) have been completely filled in. Old Drift landscapes are therefore much less relief-intensive than Young Drift regions and have hardly any natural lakes. The river system of Old Drift areas is normal and hierarchical.|$|E
5000|$|... 20 {{million years}} post-rifting, the North German Basin {{experienced}} a rapid <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediments,</b> > of strata from the Upper Rotliegend Unit to the Bunter Unit, thus experiencing maximum thermal subsidence from the Late Permian to the Middle Triassic. This rapid burial of sediments lead to subsidence rates of 220 m per million years {{due to the}} drastic increase in crustal load. Another important influence of this subsidence {{is due to the}} thermal relaxation of the lithospheric magmatic inflation, thus allowing the basin to deepen with the accumulation of the sediment.|$|E

50|$|The river {{has changed}} its course over the flatlands {{several times over}} the years, leaving wetlands, meanders and lagoons.

50|$|After {{a certain}} {{distance}} of transportation, detritus reaches a sedimentary basin and accumulates in one place. With the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediments,</b> sediments are buried {{to a deeper}} level and go though diagenesis, which turns separate sediments into sedimentary rocks (i.e. conglomerate, sandstone, mudrocks, limestone etc.) and some metamorphic rocks (such as quartzite) which were derived from sedimentary rocks. After sediments are weathered and eroded from mountain belts, they can be carried by stream and deposited along rivers as river sands. Detritus can also be transported and deposited in foreland basins and at offshore fans. The detrital record can be collected from all these places {{and can be used}} in provenance studies.|$|E

50|$|The island {{formed from}} the gradual <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> of fluvio-lacustrine origin and its natural {{landscape}} {{consists of three}} different areas: the margins, the high dunes area and the interior (depression on dunes).

The chain of dunes covers an extension from northeast to northwest. The high dunes are formed by quartz grains. Currently, the dunes have thicker vegetation because of reforestation programs carried out by private companies. There is a depression on the island, which creates many lakes in the winter, which almost completely dry in the summer.|$|E
5000|$|This {{can refer}} to <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>sediments</b> in one {{specific}} event. This event could be a large storm, landslide, volcanic eruption, or flood. The thickness of the bed could sometimes be over 50 feet in length.

A sandstone, for instance, that is well-sorted, contains erratic fossils (like brachiopods) and is wedged between sandstones that are generally poorly-sorted and contain minor siltstone layers and contains no fossils, can be interpreted as [...] "tempestite". Other event indicators could be lava flows, lahars, and glacial ice-dam breaks- all of which have been identified in the rock record.|$|E
