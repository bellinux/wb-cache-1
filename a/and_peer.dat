5|$|John Pole was {{the only}} son of Sir William Pole, 4th Baronet. The family owned the Shute House estate in east Devon, and had {{returned}} six generations of members of parliament, including John Pole's father. He had inherited the estate, and the baronetcy upon his father's death in 1741. Robert Maxwell was the oldest son of John Maxwell, 1st Baron Farnham, an Irish politician <b>and</b> <b>peer.</b> Robert {{had been a member}} of the Parliament of Ireland since 1743 for the constituency of Lisburn. He had not stood for the British parliament during the 1754 general election, though he was by that time almost certainly resident in England.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. In {{the past}} few decades {{adolescents}} have become sexually active on a younger age. This may result in risk behaviours such as drug use and delinquent behaviour. Parents <b>and</b> <b>peers</b> can {{play a role in the}} sexual experiences of adolescents. The goal of the present study is to examine the relationship between parents <b>and</b> <b>peers,</b> <b>and</b> the sexual experiences of adolescents. The focus will be on psychological control, behavioural control, sexual communication with parents <b>and</b> <b>peers,</b> sexual attitudes of parents <b>and</b> <b>peers,</b> <b>peer</b> pressure, <b>and</b> sexual experiences of peers. Method. Data of a longitudinal study has been used for the present study. A total of 1297 participants from four high schools provided information through online questionnaires. Regression analyses have been used to examine the relationship between the concepts and sexual experiences of adolescents. Results. Psychological control, sexual communication with parents <b>and</b> <b>peers,</b> sexual attitudes with parents <b>and</b> <b>peers,</b> <b>and</b> sexual experiences of peers were associated with sexual experiences of adolescents. However, the psychological control and sexual attitudes of parents associations were weak. No association was found between behavioural control, <b>peer</b> pressure <b>and</b> sexual experience of adolescents. Sexual communication with peers was the best predictor for sexual experiences of adolescents. Conclusion. Peers appeared to play a bigger role in the sexual experiences of adolescents than parents...|$|R

5|$|Maggie {{attends a}} junior high school called Buzzdale Academy with her best friend Rayna Cartflight (Cree Summer) and nemesis Dawn Swatworthy (Strong). The school's staff include the sneaky Principal Peststrip (Jeff Bennett), pompous Mr. Bugspit (Curtis Armstrong) and gruff Mrs. Wingston (Candi Milo). The Buzz on Maggie uses a slapstick comedy style and relies {{slightly}} on gross-out humor. It also includes several insect aspects, such as flies' appetite for spoiled and rotten food. The show features various references to pop culture and common themes, such as sibling rivalry <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> pressure, from a fly's point of view.|$|E

She then played in the Rogers Cup and lost to Samantha Stosur in the second round. She {{received}} a wild card entrance to the Pilot Pen Tennis tournament in New Haven, but lost in the quarterfinals to Mauresmo. This became her last tournament as 1st seeded. At the US Open she won in straight set wins over Görges, Sevastova, <b>and</b> <b>Peer,</b> but lost against Caroline Wozniacki in the fourth round. At the Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, seeded fifth, she lost to Andrea Petkovic.|$|E
5|$|The {{desperation and}} the violent {{reaction}} {{of a generation}} robbed of a safe future are well-represented by the British punk movement of 1977–1978, whose rebellion against the establishment continued diluted in the new wave and post-punk music of the 1980s. These self-proclaimed punks were politically militant, relishing their anarchic attitude and stage practices like pogo dancing. They wore short and spiked hairstyles or shaved heads, often with safety pins and ripped clothes, and considered musical prowess unimportant {{as long as the}} music was simple and loud. However, not all working-class male youths embraced the punk movement; some preferred to escape from their grim reality in heavy metal, which was equally effective in providing fun, stress relief, <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> companionship– otherwise denied because of their unemployment.|$|E
40|$|Observation of {{counsellor}} skills {{through a}} one-way mirror, video or audio recording followed by supervisors <b>and</b> <b>peers</b> feedback {{is common in}} counsellor training. The {{nature and extent of}} agreement between supervisor-peer dyads is unclear. Using a standard scale, supervisors <b>and</b> <b>peers</b> rated 32 interviews by psychology trainees observed through a one-way mirror. Results indicated that <b>peers</b> <b>and</b> supervisors used similar dimensions to cluster the various competencies. Peers rated counsellor performance more positively for general counselling skills but not for specialised techniques. Analyses revealed good supervisor-peer agreement for some items and poor agreement on others, with some differences being unacceptably large. The study has important implications for how feedback involving supervisors <b>and</b> <b>peers</b> might be managed <b>and</b> for <b>peer</b> supervision models...|$|R

5|$|The {{number of}} Finnish troops {{on each side}} varied from 70,000 to 90,000 and both had around 100,000 rifles, 300-400 machine guns and a few hundred cannons. While the Red Guards {{consisted}} mostly of volunteers (wages paid {{at the beginning of}} the war), the White Army contained only 11,000–15,000 volunteers, the remainder being conscripts. The main motives for volunteering were economic factors (salary, food), idealism, <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> pressure. The Red Guards included 2,600 female troops, mostly girls recruited from the industrial centres and cities of southern Finland. Urban and agricultural workers constituted the majority of the Red Guards, whereas land-owning farmers and well-educated people formed the backbone of the White Army.|$|E

A solitary day girl was allowed to join the Sixth Form in 1972 and the {{following}} year Wellington became co-educational. The school opened a new junior school in 2000, having previously only catered for pupils aged 10 and over.
