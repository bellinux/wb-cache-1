5|$|Josephus Struthius {{became famous}} as a {{physician}} and medical researcher. Bernard Wapowski was a pioneer of Polish cartography. Maciej Miechowita, a rector at the Cracow Academy, published in 1517 Tractatus de duabus Sarmatiis, a treatise on the geography of the East, <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Polish investigators provided first-hand expertise {{for the rest of}} Europe.|$|E
5|$|Tales of Graces {{consists}} {{primarily of}} two major areas: the field map and a battle screen. The field map is a realistically scaled 3D environment traversed by foot. On the field maps, various skits between the characters can be viewed. They involve animated character portraits, subtitles, and full voice acting. Skits concern anything from character development to side details. The battle screen is a 3D representation of <b>an</b> <b>area,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{the island}} {{operates}} as a single market is electricity. For much of their existence electricity networks in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were entirely separate. Both networks were designed and constructed independently post partition. However, {{as a result of}} changes over recent years they are now connected with three interlinks and also connected through Great Britain to mainland Europe. The situation in Northern Ireland is complicated by the issue of private companies not supplying Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) with enough power. In the Republic of Ireland, the ESB has failed to modernise its power stations and the availability of power plants has recently averaged only 66%, one of the worst such rates in Western Europe. EirGrid is building a HVDC transmission line between Ireland and Great Britain with a capacity of 500 MW, about 10% of Ireland's peak demand.|$|E

5|$|Like {{previous}} installments in the Tales series, Tales of Symphonia consists {{primarily of}} three major areas: an overworld field map, town and dungeon maps, and a battle screen. The overworld map is a 3D model, featuring a scaled-down {{version of the}} game's fictional world which the player travels through to reach the game's locations. As with preceding games in the series, the world map can be traversed by foot, on the party's quadrupedal pet Noishe, and on flying vehicles known as Rheairds. On field maps, characters are directed across realistically scaled environments. The battle screen is a 3D representation of <b>an</b> <b>area,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies.|$|E
5|$|Tales of Xillia {{consists}} {{primarily of}} two major areas: the field map and the battle screen. The field map is a realistically scaled 3D environment where the player character traverses and interacts with non-player characters, items, or mob avatars. On the field map, character interactions between the party can also be viewed {{in the form of}} a sketch story; these sketch stories are referred to as skits and consist of animated portraits and voice acting. When coming into contact with a mob avatar, the environment switches to the battle screen, a 3D representation of <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the player commands the characters in battles against the CPU-controlled mobs.|$|E
5|$|The first botanical {{collection}} {{of this species}} {{may well have been}} Claude Riche, naturalist to Bruni d'Entrecasteaux's 1791 expedition in search of the lost ships of Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse. During a visit to Esperance Bay, Riche explored <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> B.speciosa is extremely common. However, he got lost and was forced to abandon his collections. The species was eventually collected by Robert Brown in 1802, and published by him in 1810. Alex George selected an 1802 specimen collected at Lucky Bay to be the lectotype in 1981. An early common name was handsome banksia. Common names include showy banksia and ricrac banksia, from the zigzag shape of its long thin leaves.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Australian Air Force {{maintains}} several air bases, {{including three}} which are only occasionally activated. The RAAF's operational headquarters, Air Command, {{is located at}} RAAF Base Glenbrook near Sydney. The Air Force's combat aircraft are based at RAAF Base Amberley near Ipswich, Queensland, RAAF Base Tindal near Katherine, Northern Territory and RAAF Base Williamtown near Newcastle, New South Wales. The RAAF's maritime patrol aircraft are based at RAAF Base Edinburgh near Adelaide {{and most of its}} transport aircraft are based at RAAF Base Richmond in Sydney. RAAF Base Edinburgh is also home to the control centre for the Jindalee Operational Radar Network. Most of the RAAF's training aircraft are based at RAAF Base Pearce near Perth with the remaining aircraft located at RAAF Base East Sale near Sale, Victoria and RAAF Base Williamtown. The RAAF also maintains a network of bases in northern Australia to support operations to Australia's north. These bases include RAAF Base Darwin and RAAF Base Townsville and three 'bare bases' in Queensland and Western Australia. Of the RAAF's operational bases, only Tindal is located near <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the service's aircraft might feasibly see combat. While this protects the majority of the RAAF's assets from air attack, most air bases are poorly defended and aircraft are generally hangared in un-hardened shelters.|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} moored surface marker buoys {{may be used}} to demarcate <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> diving is taking place. This {{is more likely to be}} used by commercial, {{scientific}} or public service divers to cordon off a work or search area, or an accident or crime scene.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{government intervention}} was the designation in 1982 of an enterprise zone, <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> businesses were exempt from {{property taxes and}} had other incentives, including simplified planning and capital allowances. This made investing in the Docklands a significantly more attractive proposition and was instrumental in starting a property boom in the area.|$|E

25|$|L. maccaigi {{is found}} only in sediments from the Permian period, and {{apparently}} did not survive the Permian–Triassic extinction event. Its specialized features and sudden appearance in the fossil record without an obvious ancestor may indicate that it immigrated into the Karoo from <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> Late Permian sediments have not been found.|$|E
25|$|Pursuant to Section 56 of the Act, the Minister {{agreed to}} {{publication}} of the Notice for Closure, {{which was published in}} September 1966, followed in December by a notice inviting objections. East Sussex County Council responded in February 1967 with a memorandum pointing out that closure would affect <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the population was likely to almost double by 1981.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> the <b>area</b> {{around the}} {{outlying}} centre of Schupbach, black Lahn marble was once quarried.

25|$|Evidence {{indicates}} that both domestic dogs and pigs {{can also be}} infected with EBOV. Dogs {{do not appear to}} develop symptoms when they carry the virus, and pigs appear to be able to transmit the virus to at least some primates. Although some dogs in <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> a human outbreak occurred had antibodies to EBOV, it is unclear whether they played a role in spreading the disease to people.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{both inside}} the Iron Triangle {{as well as}} in the {{relocation}} camps, to which the inhabitants of Ben Suc were deported, measures such as saturation bombing and in particular the deportation of the civilian population caused tremendous resentment.

25|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, Coloured {{identity}} politics {{have grown in}} influence. The Western Cape has been a site {{of the rise of}} opposition parties, such as the Democratic Alliance (DA). The Western Cape is considered as <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> this party might gain ground against the dominant African National Congress. The Democratic Alliance drew in some former New National Party voters and won considerable Coloured support. The New National Party collapsed in the 2004 elections. Coloured support aided the Democratic Alliance's victory in the 2006 Cape Town municipal elections.|$|E
25|$|Every {{electrochemical}} capacitor has two electrodes, mechanically {{separated by}} a separator, which are ionically connected to each other via the electrolyte. The electrolyte {{is a mixture of}} positive and negative ions dissolved in a solvent such as water. At each of the two electrodes surfaces originates <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the liquid electrolyte contacts the conductive metallic surface of the electrode. This interface forms a common boundary among two different phases of matter, such as an insoluble solid electrode surface and an adjacent liquid electrolyte. In this interface occurs a very special phenomenon of the double layer effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothesis}} proposed is that {{an initial}} wolf population split into East and West Eurasian wolves. These were then domesticated independently before becoming extinct. The Western Eurasian dog population was then partially and gradually replaced by Asian dogs that were brought by humans at least 6400 years ago. A single domestication {{is thought to be}} due to chance, however dual domestication on different sides of the world is unlikely to have happened randomly and it suggests that external factors - an environmental driver - may have forced wolves to work together with humans for survival. It is possible that wolves took advantage of resources that humans had, or humans may have been introduced to wolves in <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they didn’t previously live.|$|E
50|$|The MLC's {{wildlife}} monitoring array {{was established}} in 2005. The array comprises a 1 km2 monitoring grid mapped using GPS. It provides <b>a</b> quantified <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> researchers can complete research on plants, animals and birds.|$|R
