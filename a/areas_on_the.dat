5|$|Areoles are {{structures}} {{unique to}} cacti. Although variable, they typically appear as woolly or hairy <b>areas</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stems from which spines emerge. Flowers are also produced from areoles. In the genus Pereskia, believed {{similar to the}} ancestor of all cacti, the areoles occur in the axils of leaves (i.e. in the angle between the leaf stalk and the stem). In leafless cacti, areoles are often borne on raised <b>areas</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stem where leaf bases would have been.|$|E

The game uses a random encounter system, whereby battles are triggered randomly as the player flies.|$|E
5|$|When B {{was first}} founded, the linear {{magnetic}} eddy brake {{had yet to}} be developed, so it used friction brakes as its main braking system. On the train, pads are fitted beneath the seating <b>areas.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> brakes, similar pads are connected to steel supports. When the pads on the train come into contact with the brakes, friction is created which slows the train. Beginning with Kumba in 1993, friction brakes have also been used as trim brakes that regulate the speed of the train while it is still navigating the course.|$|E

5|$|After {{the failure}} of UNOSOM in 1991-2, the US led a {{multinational}} mission—UNITAF—which included military forces to ensure aid was distributed to Somalis. The US military entered Mogadishu on December 9, 1992, and moved to quickly secure the abandoned embassy, along with the airport and port. The following day, key military staff moved into the embassy to establish headquarters for the UNITAF mission, with the main headquarters located within the chancery. The embassy complex itself was in disrepair; buildings had been stripped bare, a foot (0.3m) of debris and trash covered the floors of the chancery, and bodies were found in some <b>areas</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> premises. Personnel promptly set out cleaning the compound's living spaces and work areas {{to make room for}} the arrival and assembly area. Old warehouses were razed, and new barracks, heads and galleys were erected in their place. US Navy support elements that arrived later also imported extra materials.|$|E

Helicity levels ranged from 450–600 m2/s2, which were supportive for significant tornadic activity and strong to violent long-track tornadoes.|$|E
