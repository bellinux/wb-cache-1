[...] Allegations were made by all the political parties in the state. While the CPM, Congress and BJP again accused TMC of facilitating and profiting from the fraud, TMC said the companies were allowed to register during the government run by CPM {{in the state and}} Congress in the centre. Mamata Bannerjee, Chief Minister of West Bengal and Chairperson of TMC, attacked P. Chidambaram, the finance minister of the central government, alleging a political vendetta in the timingcoinciding with the parliamentary electionsof a spurt in Enforcement Directorate investigation.

6000|$|It {{is rather}} curious that tales of {{volatile}} furniture {{are by no}} means very common in trials for witchcraft. The popular belief was, and probably still is, that a witch or warlock could throw a spell over an enemy so that his pots, and pans, tables and chairs, would skip around. The disturbances of this variety, in the presbytery at Cideville, in Seine Inferieure (1850), came under the eye of the law, because a certain shepherd injudiciously boasted that he had caused them by his magic art. {123a} The cure, who was the victim, took him at his word, and the shepherd swain lost his situation. He then brought an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>defamation</b> of character, but was non- suited, as it was proved that he had been the fanfaron of his own vices. In Froissart's amusing story of Orthon, that noisy sprite was hounded on by a priest. At Tedworth, the owner of the drum was 'wanted' on a charge of sorcery as the cause of the phenomena. The Wesleys suspected that their house was bewitched. But examples in witch trials are not usual. Mr. Graham Dalyell, however, gives one case, 'the firlote rynning about with the stuff popling,' {{on the floor of a}} barn, and one where 'the sive and the wecht dancit throw the hous'. {123b} ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{person can}} become an [...] "involuntary public figure" [...] {{as the result of}} publicity, even though that person did not want or invite the public attention. For example, people accused of high profile crimes may be unable to pursue <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> <b>defamation</b> even after their innocence is established...A person can also become a [...] "limited public figure" [...] by {{engaging}} in actions which generate publicity within a narrow area of interest.

40|$|How legal <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> <b>defamation</b> arise, what a {{complainant}} {{has to show}} to win a libel case, what he/she {{does not}} have to show and who can sue. An understanding of the risk of committing defamation is of fundamental importance in journalism, but little that the working journalist or student journalist needs to know is enshrined in statute. The law is largely founded on precedent and that which is considered defamatory will vary from time to time, community to community- and from person to person. Students are often asked to learn by rote a series of guidelines and an ever-growing list of cases and precedents, but this does not embed the learning they require how to analyse a report and evaluate any risk of defamation in the light of what is written / broadcast and the context in which it is to appear. The approach presented here encourages discovery of the principle...|$|R
