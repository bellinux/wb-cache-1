40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{operational}} observations, carried out on a metro line, equipped with ATP, the achievement {{is to develop a}} theoretical formulation of the reliability concept through definition of suitable indices, focussing its aleatory components. It is proved, more over, through data coming from a case study, how automation in line operation reduce variability of such aleatory components, increasing reliability. Headway reliability {{is one of the most}} important factors for evaluation of the quality of an underground railway operation. Control and regulation actions have the scope to restore a regular headway of train transit when they shift from the theoretical sequence due to a perturbation. For this reason reliability has been chosen as parameter to evaluate the effects of automation introduction in some operational aspects. It has been defined a reliability index which is the difference between real headway and theoretical headway, measured in a given section of the line. Furthermore a reliability coefficient represent a percentage of reliability index average. <b>Actual</b> <b>headway</b> is a aleatory quantity depending on other aleatory quantities like running times, stop times and times for the headline operations. The concept of the adopted theoretical model is that headway between two train running a certain section is a sum of terms depending upon running time of the section itself, transit time through stations and headline operation time...|$|E
40|$|Service {{reliability}} {{effects on}} passengers Service reliability {{is an important}} quality characteristic in public transport. However, in cost-benefit analyses, this quality aspect is rarely taken into account explicitly, since the interaction between vehicle variability and passenger reliability is complex. In our research [Van Oort 2011], we presented the main impacts on vehicle variability on passengers, being additional waiting time, a distribution of passenger travel time (and thus insecure arrival times) and crowding. In this paper we describe how to calculate these effects quantitavely and how to take them into account in a cost benefit analysis. Figure 1 illustrates the differences and relations between the demand and supply sides. Passenger waiting time is determined by <b>actual</b> <b>headways</b> and departure times next to passenger arrival time at the stop. In addition, passenger in-vehicle time {{is equal to the}} trip time of the vehicle and together with the departure time, the arrival time at the destination stop is set. In this paper, we provide equations to translate vehicle characteristics into passenger effects. This relationship depends on the arrival pattern of passengers at their arrival stop. In a survey we found out that passenger tend to arrive at random if headways are 10 minutes or less. In that case the additional waiting time of passengers is determined by the headway variation...|$|R
40|$|The <b>actual</b> bus <b>headway</b> often {{deviates}} {{from the}} planned departure frequency because of external factors, such as traffic conditions and public transport demand, leading to transit resource waste {{and reducing the}} quality of service. In view of the existing shortcomings of the current dispatching strategy, a mixed integer programming model, integrating a bus-holding and stop-skipping strategy, is constructed to improve transit service with a minimum cost. The real-time optimal holding and stop-skipping strategies {{can be obtained by}} solving the proposed model using the Lagrangian relaxation algorithm. A numerical example is conducted using real transit GPS (Global Position System) and IC (Intelligent Card) data in Harbin. The results show that compared to a single control strategy, the proposed hybrid model is a better trade-off between the quality of the transit service and the operation cost. Notably, such a strategy would produce a minimal passengersâ€™ average travel time coefficient. It is a great help for promoting the transit service level and increasing competitiveness...|$|R
40|$|We {{improve the}} typical GM car-following model. In order to {{describe}} the impacts of the lateral offset between the vehicles in car-following state, this paper proposes time distance to measure the drivers' attention of driving environment and uses generalized expectation headway {{to describe the}} ideal driving state of the driver. Take {{the difference between the}} <b>actual</b> and expected <b>headway</b> as the important standard for driver to decide whether to speed up or slow down. Then take the drivers' attentions and the expected headway as the decision-making factors, and consider them while revising the GM car-following model. The numerical simulation shows the improved GM model conforms to the general driving behavior, enhances the function of the typical model, and strengthens the model stability...|$|R
