25|$|<b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> <b>was</b> {{unable to}} attend the table reads of the script, so Maurice LaMarche read his lines. He notes in the DVD {{commentary}} that Gore's daughter Kristin, who wrote for Futurama, was also at the table read, and he jokes that {{this was one of}} the highlights of his career. Additional voice roles in the episode include Tress MacNeille as Joan Rivers' preserved head in a jar and LaMarche as the headless body of Spiro Agnew. Billy West, who voices Nixon's head, says that his impression of Nixon is not meant to be an accurate impression but it intentionally plays up certain quirks and flaws. West also voices the C-3PO-esque robot which appears early in the Professor's flashback. He accomplished the voice effect by speaking into a coffee cup during the recording of the lines.|$|E

[...] Warning also contains more explicitly political themes, as exemplified by tracks such as [...] "Minority".
