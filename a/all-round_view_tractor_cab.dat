Measurements were carried out in five farmers as five different tractors similar performance. As reference was used Zetor 12145, which was compared with New Holland T 6070 Tractor, Landini Powerfarm 100, 135 Zetor Fronterra and Deutz-Fahr M 620. The results of all measurements were graphically displayed and compared each other. In conclusion, the results were compared to measurements with the legislation. The measurement spat out of the rear tractor does not exceed the noise limit, which indicates the legislation. Dust measurements was more indicative of the diversity of the weather...|$|R

50|$|<b>Tractor</b> <b>cabs</b> {{became more}} {{widespread}} in the 1960s, especially in the Nordic markets, due to more stringent safety regulations and comfort requirements. The original Valmet factory in Tourula, Finland, could not assemble <b>tractors</b> with <b>cabs</b> due to the low ceiling, and the factory area near the expanding centre of Jyväskylä began to be too small. Accordingly, tractor production moved in 1969 to Suolahti, where the state owned an industrial site. Transmission production followed in 1975 following {{the construction of a}} new plant on the site. Marketing and engineering operations moved to Suolahti in 2005 and 2006.|$|R

[...] Most occupational exposures are caused by absorption through exposed skin such as the face, hands, forearms, neck, and chest. This exposure is sometimes enhanced by inhalation in settings including spraying operations in greenhouses and other closed environments, <b>tractor</b> <b>cabs,</b> and the operation of rotary fan mist sprayers.|$|R

40|$|In agriculture, {{anthropometry}} has {{a remarkable}} relevance above all {{in design and}} realization of a <b>tractor</b> <b>cab.</b> The operators spend much time in driving tractors and an uncomfortable cab represents a risk for them. A space too narrow is extremely dangerous in case of overturning, for the collisions with the internal parts of the cab, and it can favour unintentional use of the commands with consequences on the behaviour of the vehicle. This paper is focused on experimental analysis of the internal dimension of <b>tractor</b> <b>cabs.</b> The main goal is to verify the respect of “the least overall dimensions” of the driver (according to UNI EN ISO 3411 standard), calculated on the biggest driver size, corresponding to the internal cab surface with no visible deformation. Measurements {{have been carried out}} on 15 tractors differently dimensioned and aged, later compared to the provided limits, in order to verify the least overall dimensions. The results show that all the cabs, also if approved in accordance with OECD standard, don’t respect one or more parameters provided by the UNI EN ISO 3411 standard.

40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to provide a}} foundation of basic information which will be useful in designing air curtain <b>tractor</b> <b>cabs.</b> The main purpose {{of this investigation was}} to determine the relationships involved by studying the effect of a crosswind on an air curtain. This information will provide answers to questions concerning the feasibility of the air curtain <b>tractor</b> <b>cab.</b> Another purpose of this investigation was to determine what effect, if any, a curtain of air will have on noise. As a result of these findings, recommendations will be made concerning areas of needed future research. Finally, a prototype design of an air curtain tractor will be proposed. The study concludes that the application of an air curtain for a tractor to protect the operator appears feasible. It will deflect winds of up to 20 mph from the operator. Based on previous findings, the determined design air curtain velocities are more than enough to keep rain, dust, insects, etc. from penetrating the curtain. It will not reduce tractor noise, but if a suitable fan system can be designed, the air curtain will at least not increase the existing noise levels. It is evident that more research is needed.

50|$|In {{addition}} to rear underride guards, truck <b>tractor</b> <b>cabs</b> may {{be equipped with}} a Front Underrun Protection System (FUPS) at the front bumper of the truck. The safest tractor-trailers are also equipped with side underride guards, also called Side Underrun Protection System (SUPS). These additional barriers prevent passenger cars from skidding underneath the trailer from the side, such as in an oblique or side collision, or if the trailer jackknifes across the road. In {{addition to}} safety benefits, these underride guards may improve fuel mileage by reducing air turbulence under the trailer at highway speeds.|$|R

SugarGrass is fermentable for extracting the juice that becomes ethanol to be used on farm or sold. But the dried remnants can also be used either as fodder or as feedstock for yet another bioenergy variant, biomass power station burning.|$|R

40|$|An optimal thermal {{climate in}} a vehicle is an {{important}} determinant factor for the driver's health, performance and comfort A poor climate and its effects upon the driver may endanger traffic safety [4]. In the confmed space of a <b>tractor</b> <b>cab</b> the thermal environment becomes very complex. Driver sits close to walls and windows. Glass windows are large and poorly insulated. Radiative heat exchange caused by cold or solar load may locally be excessive. HVAC-systems are normally powerful to compensate for poor insulation and considerable temperature gradients may build up. In addition, air velocities may be locally very high. The thermal impact on the driver {{is not easy to}} evaluate. Spot measurements are difficult to interprete and most climate indices only account for the avernge or whole body effect of the thermal load. This is not sufficient, since man may feel thermoneutral but still suffer severely from local thermal disturbances and asymmetries. Measurements with a thermal manikin yield a more complete, integrated and detailed picture of thennal effects [3, 6] [...] The purpose of the present investigation was to compare measurements with a thermal manikin with comfort votes obtained for a panel of subjects. METHOD A man-sized, sitting thermal manikin (AlMAN) was positioned in the driver's seat in a <b>tractor</b> <b>cab,</b> placed in a climatic chamber.
