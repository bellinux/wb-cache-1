5|$|The Simpson County sheriff moved Dinning to Bowling Green and {{eventually}} to Louisville {{to prevent him from}} being lynched. Governor Bradley dispatched a squad of the state militia to protect him while his trial proceeded. Despite the fact that the case involved a black man killing a white man, most observers believed Dinning would be acquitted on grounds of self-defense. The jury, however, convicted Dinning of manslaughter and sentenced him to seven years of hard labor. Immediately, Bradley's office was flooded with requests for him to intervene on Dinning's behalf. The requests came from blacks and whites, some of them ex-Confederates. Dinning's attorney, Augustus E. Willson, formally requested a pardon, and Bradley issued it 10days after the conviction. Bradley opined that Dinning had acted reasonably under the circumstances and that it was <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> <b>that</b> no members of the mob were charged. After being freed, Dinning relocated to Indiana and hired ex-Confederate Bennett H. Young to file a federal lawsuit against some members of the mob that had identified themselves during his trial. The trial was held in Louisville, and Dinning was awarded $50,000 in damages.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interesting}} postscript, Tewodros II {{is said to}} have disbelieved that Haile Melekot was really dead and demanded that his body be disinterred. When he saw the body of the dead king, the Emperor {{is said to have}} wept for him, saying it was <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> <b>that</b> illness should deny a brave man such as the King of Shewa, the honor of falling in battle. He ordered that Haile Melekot be re-buried with all the pomp and ceremony due to a king.|$|E
25|$|When {{scoring the}} opening goal {{in a home}} match against Middlesbrough on August 18, 2007, McBride dislocated his kneecap. He wouldn't make his return to action until a {{friendly}} against Cardiff City in late January 2008, and resumed his Premier League duties as a substitute against Aston Villa on February 3, 2008. McBride scored his first goal since his injury against Everton at Craven Cottage on March 16, 2008, in a 1–0 victory for Fulham. The then-Fulham manager Chris Coleman commented it was such <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> <b>that</b> McBride hadn't been 'discovered' earlier in his career, and played more in England.|$|E

25|$|Despite expectations, {{prior to}} and during the season a total of sevenUT players were {{suspended}} for various infractions. Brown said “I am extremely disappointed that four of our student-athletes have had issues with the law this summer. That is not reflective of the high standard of class, character and integrity we have established at Texas for many years. It’s <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> <b>that</b> these recent events have generated {{a great deal of}} negative attention, because I do think that overall, this is as good of a group of kids that I’ve ever coached. I think that will show over time.” The negative publicity was more extensive than in past instances but Mack Brown publicly supported the players while denouncing their actions.|$|E
25|$|In November 1991, Schweizer Illustrierte {{magazine}} {{published an}} article on black money held in secret accounts by Imelda Marcos and 14 other rulers of Third World countries. Citing McKinsey as a source, the article stated that Rajiv Gandhi held 2.5 billion Swiss francs in secret Indian accounts in Switzerland. Several leaders of opposition parties in India have raised the issue, citing the Schweizer Illustrierte article. In December 1991, Amal Datta raised {{the issue in the}} Indian Parliament; the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, Shivraj Patil, expunged Rajiv Gandhi's name from the proceedings. In December 2011, Subramanian Swamy wrote to the director of the Central Bureau of Investigation, citing the article and asking him to take action on black money accounts of the Nehru-Gandhi family. On 29 December 2011, Ram Jethmalani made an indirect reference to the issue in the Rajya Sabha, calling it <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> <b>that</b> one of India's former Prime Ministers was named by a Swiss magazine. This was met by uproar and a demand for withdrawal of the remark by the ruling Congress party members.|$|E
25|$|It was Neil's {{last season}} and it was <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> <b>that</b> his amazing career should end in an uncharacteristic {{outburst}} of bad temper against Ted Dexter. I never did {{get to the bottom}} of the row but perhaps it was just because he and Ted were total opposites as people. All I know is that his press comments on Ted lost him a lot of friends. These attacks upset the MCC players more than anything else that happened on that tour, and for Neil to retire from the game on this sour note was disappointing for those who had played with an against him, and for the public who had enjoyed his performances. For all this, you couldn't help admiring some of Neil's knocks, including his sixth Test century against England. He was nearly always exciting to watch because he was the sort of batsman who was supremely capable of winning or saving a match. He was also good to bowl to because he gave you a chance; he played shots and he took risks. And his fielding was quite brilliant; in this series, it was easily the best on either side. He stopped some wonderful shots in the covers and took some terrific catches. It was just sad to see such a talented man consumed by such bitterness.|$|E

But when {{there was nothing left}} to upgrade, Hearn wrote that [...] "it's <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> <b>that</b> the innovation is confined to the first few hours". While Ridiculous Fishing offered many hours of secrets and unlocks, IGN's Davis noted that the game was at its core a [...] "simple arcade experience ... ultimately a polished arcade time-killer".|$|E

[...] Gradually, the couple's relationship became based on a cordial friendship: Marie accorded Ferdinand respect she believed he was due as a man and, later, as king, and he respected her because he realised that she had {{a better understanding of the}} world than he did. Eventually, Marie came to believe that she and Ferdinand were [...] "the best associates, the most loyal companions, but our lives intertwine only in certain matters". Ferdinand enjoyed Marie's presence during military marches and consequently, she was frequently invited to this sort of event.|$|E
500|$|Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{gave the}} single {{three out of}} a {{possible}} five stars. Copsey wasn't convinced with Cruz's vocal work on the song commenting that Kesha takes over the track, [...] "Cruz's vocals soar over the verses, his delicate tones fails to dent that deliciously trashy chorus. Luckily, guest star Kesha more than steps up to the mark [...] it's a bit of <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> <b>that</b> it's not her version of the song". Ken Capobianco from The Boston Globe was negative in his review of the song. Capobianco called the song [...] "salacious", writing that it [...] "features that notorious no-talent, Ke$ha, but with its galloping percussion it makes for salacious nonsense." [...] Ash Dosanjh from NME wrote that Cruz' downfall on his album was when he acted as the [...] "player", citing [...] "Dirty Picture" [...] as an example.|$|E

500|$|In October 2005, {{work was}} begun {{by a group}} of Ukrainian {{developers}} to port Decay over to Windows, as a modification for both the old World Opponent Network and current Steam versions of Half-Life. The port relied on the discovery of a method that allowed Decays PS2 game files to be deciphered, thereby allowing the files to be ported to Windows. The port went into the beta development stage in December 2007 and was released publicly on September 23, 2008. The port was received well by the journalists in the industry; GameSpy site Planet Half-Life noted that it was <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> <b>that</b> an official PC version of Decay never emerged, while British journalist Alec Meer stated that it was [...] "fantastic to have this short but sweet lost Half-Life episode on PC at last, and it even has something the PS2 version didn't—online play".|$|E

[...] In his mixed review of Worlds, Derek Staples of Consequence of Sound praised “Flicker” and “Goodbye to a World” for highlighting [...] "Robinson’s more intricate big room capabilities" [...] in an album where [...] "Robinson hides his former bass-fueled self behind the album’s sheen." [...] Allmusic journalist Andy Kellman said in his review of the album that [...] "Flicker", along with [...] "Lionhearted" [...] and [...] "Years of War" [...] "have sections muscular and bold enough to move large crowds", while Las Vegas Weekly critic Mike Prevatt described the track's hook as having an [...] "emotional payoff." ...|$|E
500|$|Garcia was not {{selected}} {{a member of}} the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

Baseball historian Bill James dismissed Garcia's low ERA due to the [...] "cold, cavernous Cleveland Municipal Stadium, which at that time had a pitcher's mound higher than white cliffs of Dover". Referring to Garcia's great seasons of 1949 to 1954, baseball historian Wayne Corbett countered, [...] "Garcia's more famous teammates enjoyed the same home-field advantage, but it was Garcia who recorded the staff's lowest ERA in four of those six seasons." [...] Historian Stephen Lombardi wrote, [...] "It is <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> <b>that</b> Mike Garcia is sometimes disregarded. A career such as his does not deserve to fade away from the memory of the overall baseball public."

500|$|Breath of Mana is {{a promotional}} album {{of music from}} Dawn of Mana {{included}} with preorders {{of the game in}} Japan. Despite the many composers of the full soundtrack, the five songs on Breath were all composed and arranged by Kenji Ito. Three of the songs, [...] "Breath of MANA", [...] "Unforgotten Memories", and [...] "Rising Sun (piano solo ver.)", did not appear on the full soundtrack album. The songs on the disc are [...] "gentle melodies" [...] using orchestra and piano. The five songs cover a duration of 13:41. The disc was published by Square Enix on December 21, 2006. A review of the album by Dennis Rubinshteyn of RPGFan called it a [...] "good showcase" [...] of the strengths of the full album, which were in his opinion the tracks by Ito.

Houx wrote that [...] "the return of Jan Levinson and the final solution to get her business was pretty good." [...] Adams, on the other hand, was critical of the return of Hardin, noting that [...] "there's little reason to justify Melora Hardin's presence in 'The Whale other than [...] "an obligation [...] The Offices final-season victory lap." [...] White noted that it [...] "was nice to see Melora Hardin in the role one last time", but wrote that [...] "it's <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> <b>that</b> the show is sticking with the crazy version of the character rather than mellowing her out a bit". Melora Hardin's performance was later submitted by the producers of The Office for an [...] "Outstanding Guest Actor in Comedy Series" [...] Emmy consideration.|$|E
500|$|Chamber pop {{was part}} of a larger trend which {{involved}} musicians who rejected traditional rock conventions, such as Tortoise and Stereolab, although those specific bands are not considered ork-pop. [...] The genre's orchestration is typically more complex than rock music, making extensive use of brass and strings. It drew from the 1990s lounge music revival but avoided any influence from other contemporary styles like grunge, electronica, or alternative music, particularly the lo-fi hiss and distortion of the last. Although modern rock groups like Smashing Pumpkins, Oasis, and R.E.M. occasionally used strings, their approach was considerably less intricate. The High Llamas were one of the first to anticipate the easy-listening fad with their 1993 debut album Gideon Gaye. O'Hagan felt that [...] "There is this whole misconception that American college rock with twisted baseball hats and checked shirts is adventurous, but it's the most conformist, corporate thing out there.... All these bands sound like Nirvana and Pearl Jam. It's <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> <b>that</b> it couldn't be discovered from the get-go for what it is. A lot of it is just very simple dumb-guy rock." ...|$|E
