40|$|The {{following}} {{report will}} introduce train control systems applied in railway lines in Japan. The report also {{will show that}} train control systems have been developed and these are classified four levels from “Level 0 ” to “Level 3 ”. We call these train control systems “East Japan Train Control system ” (EJTC). “Level 0 ” system, the <b>Automatic</b> Train <b>Stop</b> <b>device</b> (ATS-S), was introduced into Japanese National Railways (JNR) to prevent train collision. This system has been replacing with Pattern type ATS (ATS-P); “Level 1 ” system. ATS-P was developed to eliminate the weaknesses of the ATS-S. The Automatic Train Control (ATC) system was originally developed to support safe, super-high speed railway transportation utilizing Japan’s Shinkansen and introduced into conventional commuter lines to shorten the train interval. However {{it was difficult to}} realize efficient operations in high-density lines due to limitations of existing ATC technology. Then the D-ATC system (Digital and Decentralized ATC) had been developed as “Level 2 ” system using ADS technology. In D-ATC system, the device on each train autonomously calculates permitted speed of each train. This system is introduced to Keihn-tohoku Line as D-ATC and Shinkansen Line as DS-ATC (Digital Communication & Control for Shinkansen-ATC). Recent remarkable progress in the field of information technology makes possible a new train control system where train itself detects its location and communicates with other trains through radio transmission. Therefore, we have been developing the “Level 3 ” train control system called ATAC...|$|R
50|$|Signals set to {{stop for}} the diesel light rail cars are {{positively}} enforced via Intermittent Inductive <b>Automatic</b> Train <b>Stop.</b> The system is similar (but not identical) to the German Indusi system, where signal aspects are transmitted to moving trains from wayside devices. The inductive train <b>stop</b> <b>devices</b> are placed by the running rails {{in advance of the}} absolute signals. Train's emergency brakes are automatically engaged if a stop signal overrun occurs and interlockings are designed with sufficient overlap for trains to come to a complete stop before conflicting with other traffic.|$|R

50|$|In March 1998, Automatic Train Control was {{introduced}} on the 02 series, which {{was supplemented with}} a Train <b>Automatic</b> <b>Stopping</b> Controller (TASC) system allowing them to stop automatically at stations since November 2002.|$|R

50|$|Automatic {{train control}} (ATC) and Train <b>automatic</b> <b>stopping</b> {{controller}} (TASC) were activated on the Ginza Line on July 31, 1993, replacing the previous mechanical <b>Automatic</b> train <b>stop</b> (ATS) system. This allowed {{for an increase}} in the maximum operating speed limit from 55 km/h to 65 km/h, which came into effect on August 2, 1993.

40|$|The {{article is}} {{concerned}} with eÆcient edge-preserving numerical techniques for noise removal via anisotropic diusion. New minimum-biased (MB) nite dierence formulas are introduced to minimize diusion on both the piecewise smooth portions and their boundaries. Locally one-dimensional time-stepping algorithms are analyzed and a formula for eÆcient timestep sizes is suggested, to remove the high-frequency components of the error (the noise) more eÆciently and to minimize the torture of lower-frequency components of the image. An eective strategy is suggested for an <b>automatic</b> <b>stopping</b> of the diusion pro-cess. It is numerically veried that the MB formulas eliminate, rather than diuse, the noise of piecewise constant images. With such a property, the MB formulas are successfully applied to noise removal of general images. Numerical examples carried out with various images are presented to demonstrate superior properties of (a) the new MB formulas, (b) the formula for timestep sizes, and (c) the <b>automatic</b> <b>stopping</b> strategy of the diusion process...|$|R

50|$|An <b>automatic</b> train <b>stop</b> or ATS is {{a system}} on a train that {{automatically}} stops a train if certain situations occur (unresponsive train operator, earthquake, disconnected rail, train running over a stop signal, etc.) to prevent accidents. In some scenarios it functions {{as a type of}} dead man's switch. <b>Automatic</b> train <b>stop</b> differs from the concept of Automatic Train Control in that ATS does not feature an onboard speed control mechanism.|$|R
50|$|TBL1+ {{began to}} be {{installed}} on the Belgian rail network in 2006, with full conversion to the system expected by 2012. The system is a development of TBL1, but uses Eurobalises, providing compatibility for later reconfiguration to an ETCS system. An additional safety measure is the addition of an additional balise 300m up-line, which forces an <b>automatic</b> <b>stop</b> on trains travelling at more than 40 km/h ahead of a red signal.|$|R
