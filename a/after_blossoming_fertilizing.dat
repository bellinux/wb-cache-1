40|$|The {{helicoidal}} {{structure of}} cotton fibrils causes optical rotation {{effects on the}} polarized light. Therefore, cotton fibers appear yellowish or bluish even under the cross-polarizers when a wave plate is inserted. In this paper, the extinction angle caused by the optical rotation of cotton fibers was measured using a polarizing microscope. For this measurement, cotton was planted and young fibers were obtained from cotton boll some days <b>after</b> <b>blossom.</b> The secondary cell wall started to grow about 20 days <b>after</b> <b>blossom.</b> The extinction angle was found to become larger {{with the growth of}} cotton boll. Different signs were observed for the optical rotation angle for different senses of helicoidal structure of the cotton fibrils. The optical rotation was shown to be caused by the growth of secondary cell membrane in cotton fiber. The helicoidal structure of Z-type was found to be more effective for optical rotation than that of S-type...|$|R

Setting free adult A. mali at the beginning of June reduced the aphid population, though its efficiency was not high enough to prevent damage of the trees totally. The practical applications of A. mali in early spring (<b>after</b> <b>blossom)</b> were not effective because climatic conditions were not suitable enough. The fertility of A. mali depends on temperature and light intensity. The application of Micula (rape oil) and T-S forte reduced the growth of the aphid population effectively.

At the harvest moment, the main physic-chemical characteristics of fruits, the total yield and the efficiency index, were determined.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to define irrigation scheduling for coffee trees in the brazilian Cerrado region to optimize yield and coffee grain quality. The experimental treatments were: a) irrigation all over the year (RH 1), suplemental water application <b>after</b> <b>blossoming</b> induced by rain (RH 4), stop water application, at the harvesting time from June 15 to end of August until leaf water potential measured at pre-dawn reached - 2. 0 MPa (RH 3) and - 3, 4 MPa (RH 4) and rainfed crop. The soil water content was monitored by using a profile probe of 1 m. Water was applied to fill the soil profile of 0. 40 m until field capacity (- 0, 0008 MPa) as soil water depletion reached 50 % of available soil water. The results shows that stopping irrigation from June 15 to end of August, until leaf potential, measured at pre-drawn, reached value of - 2. 0 MPa resulted in just on uniform blossoming period, more than 80 % pf mature grain at harvesting time and yield of 4. 200 kg. ha(- 1) of peeled coffee grain in the last three comercial harvesting. 200...|$|R
50|$|NAA {{is widely}} used in {{agriculture}} for various purposes. It {{is considered to be}} only slightly toxic but when at higher concentrations it can be toxic to animals. This was shown when tested on rats via oral ingestion at 1000-5900 mg/kg. NAA has been shown to greatly increase cellulose fiber formation in plants when paired with another phytohormone called gibberellic acid. Because it is in the auxin family it has also been understood to prevent premature dropping and thinning of fruits from stems. It is applied <b>after</b> <b>blossom</b> fertilization. Increased amounts of it can actually have negative effects however, and cause growth inhibition to the development of plant crops. It has been used on many different crops including apples, olives, oranges, potatoes, and various other hanging fruits. In order for it to obtain its desired effects it must be applied in concentrations ranging from 20-100 ug/mL. NAA present in the environment undergoes oxidation reactions with hydroxyl radicals and sulphate radicals. Radical reactions of NAA was studied by using pulse radiolysis technique. Hydroxyl adduct radical was formed as the intermediate during the reaction of hydroxyl radical with NAA. The intermediate Naphtyl methyl radical was formed during the reaction of sulphate radical anion with NAA.|$|R
