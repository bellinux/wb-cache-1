40|$|This essay analyse the {{anti-dumping}} {{policy of}} the European Union, with specific focus on the anti-dumping tariff imposed on imports of ertain footwear from the People’s Republic of China from 1997 to 2002. Even though free trade is expected from {{the members of the}} World Trade Organization (WTO) there are certain exceptions. One is when there is a suspicion that goods are being dumped in a foreign market, i. e. the exporter sells the product at a lower price in the foreign market than in its home market. Article VI in GATT regulates this together with the Anti-dumping Agreement. In 1997 EU imposed an <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measure</b> on certain footwear imported from the People’s Republic of China. This measure was in effect until 2002 (the maximum time for an anti-dumping tariff is five years). We expect to see a decrease of footwear exports from the People’s Republic of China to the European Union during this period. By using a log-linear regression analysis we can see that the EU imports of Chinese footwear did indeed decrease from its trend otherwise during 1997 to 2002. Since the industry overall increased its sales during the same period, we draw the conclusion that the tariff was the reason for the decreased imports...|$|R

40|$|The {{usage of}} {{unconventional}} trade protections have been thriving worldwide and anti-dumping initiation {{is one of}} them. India has appeared the highest initiator of anti-dumping in the world during 1995 - 2010. The paper tries to investigate the impact of such initiatives on trade flows and resultant welfare with a particular reference to Indian economy. Anti-dumping initiative defends competition, protects domestic producers and goes against consumer welfare in general, but the strategic initiative may lead to rise in AD-jumping FDI flows, resulting to an improvement in domestic welfare. Theoretically, {{we find that the}} possibility of AD-jumping FDI depends on the foreign price and labour market conditions in the domestic economy. Closer to the oligopoly price in the domestic economy lower would be the possibility and greater would be a loss of domestic welfare. Moreover, in the presence of unions, such possibility goes down. The study uses industry and firm level information empirically to see the impact. It is observed that the AD initiation does not affect the imports significantly. FDI has grown but still very small. The mark-up of AD intensive industries seems to be on the higher side and does not support the AD-jumping FDI proposition effectively. A large share of Indian initiatives, similar to other countries, has been against China and other neighboring countries, leading to rise an issue of predatory pricing including the rules of origin applicable largely with them. We suggest that AD investigation process should look at (i) the price formation and rules of origin in the foreign markets, (ii) the extent of extra-legal employment and environmental damage due to the increased import competition. Although Indian government has been quite active in taking decision on any petition against dumping, the existing laws favour only a small section of producers, do not apply uniform methods of injury calculation and do not show any concern about labour and environment. We suggest that the safeguard measure should be taken up first before using <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>measure</b> in cased of dumping...|$|R

40|$|This {{inquiry report}} was {{released}} on 27 May 2010. The Australian anti-dumping system, {{which is based on}} agreed WTO rules and procedures, benefits a small number of import competing firms, but imposes greater costs {{on the rest of the}} economy. However, this net economic cost is likely to be very small. And the ability for Australian industries, like those in most other countries, to use the system to address what are perceived by many to be ‘unfair’ trading practices, may have lessened resistance to more significant tariff reforms. This ‘political economy’ argument for retaining the system would be strengthened by changes to address a number of deficiencies in the current arrangements which can add to the costs for the community. In particular: there is no consideration of the wider economic impacts of <b>anti-dumping</b> measures; <b>measures</b> can too easily become akin to long-term protection, or outdated in the face of changing market circumstances; decision-making and its outcomes are not sufficiently transparent. Introduction of a ‘bounded’ public interest test, drawing on similar provisions overseas, would be a practical means to take account of wider impacts and prevent the imposition of measures that would be disproportionately costly. tariffs; import controls; anti-dumping; trading practices...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} paper {{is based on}} an assessment {{of the effects of the}} recent financial crisis on the international trade and the way states and international organizations acted in this context. The importance of this research topic consists in identifying the way the international trade liberalization process has been affected by the financial crisis and the way anti-crisis measures deviated from the basic rules agreed under the aegis of WTO/GATT. The intended purpose of the paper is to conduct a substantive assessment of undertaken actions by the various states aimed to mitigate crisis impact on <b>anti-dumping</b> investigations and <b>measures.</b> Precisely, it was assayed whether the international financial crisis has been an opportunity for WTO member states to plainly intervene in the economy and give up the commitments they made in the context of multilateral commercial negotiations. Considering the international, regional and national effects of the crisis the topic has been copiously elaborated on by economics literature. A number of anti-crisis measures were presented encouraging massive intervention in the economy, as well as actions, particularly of International Organizations according to which measures could be taken without deviating from globally agreed mechanisms and principles. In order to be able to find out which of these two options prevailed in actions undertaken by the states the types of international, regional or national anti-crisis measures were selected. Positions voiced by the World Trade Organization, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), European Union are rendered. To answer the question about the way it has been responded in order to mitigate crisis effects, adopted anti-crisis measures were inventoried and their deviation from international rules was assessed. One of the indicators used in the assessment of anti-crisis measures is the progress of the <b>anti-dumping</b> investigations and <b>measures</b> notified to WTO in the past 9 years for which data were available (2003 - 2009). The relevance of this period lies in the fact that it includes 5 pre-crisis years and 2 years when it was strongly evident. It was found that the number of anti-crisis investigations and measures has not seen significant increases during the crisis period. Moreover, it has been found that states have shown a certain amount of flexibility in construing application of certain international principles rather than relinquishing them. It is thereby demonstrated that the international trade liberalization process continues without major disruptions by the financial crisis. This gives confidence to states and business environment with respect to predictability of international trade developments. The paper has significant added value brought about by both literature processing and interpretation and the author's experience in international trade negotiations. The very election of the indicator pertaining to <b>anti-dumping</b> investigations and <b>measures</b> was based on the fact that changing trade defence mechanisms into protectionist mechanisms often stands for prevailing immediate crisis resolution. financial crisis, antidumping investigations and measures, trade liberalization, state aid, preferential trade systems...|$|R

50|$|Within the {{international}} system {{it is difficult to}} enforce international law, particularly with regard to human rights. So using trade sanctions as a coercive measure is an appealing prospect to ensure cooperation. However, there are many reasons why trade sanctions are an inappropriate mechanism for enforcing labour standards. They are generally against WTO principles, and can only be used in very limited circumstances that are authorized by the WTO agreements, such as <b>anti-dumping</b> and countervailing <b>measures.</b> Politically, it is unlikely that unilateral action would be allowed for breaches of labour standards. Even assuming that labour standards are able to be enforced through trade measures within the WTO, either through amendments to GATT XX, the introduction of a social clause or any other measure, they do not provide a solution to the complexity of the labour standards issue and should not be used to deal with disputes over labour standards.|$|R
40|$|At first glance, {{this paper}} {{deals with a}} simple {{classification}} issue only: the coverage and treatment of certain manufacturing operations and the resulting products under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) rather than under its long-standing counterpart in merchandise trade, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).

However, the relevant criteria separating goods- from services-related operations are not only hard to specify and monitor in practice, but it is also difficult to see an underlying policy rationale. In the interest of clarity and consistency, WTO Members might thus want to close this conceptual trapdoor.

40|$|The {{last two}} decades have {{witnessed}} that countries across the world are guided by {{the rules and regulations}} of multilateral trading institutions (for example, World Trade organization [WTO], International Monetary Fund [IMF]) in order to promote free and fair trade through gradual reduction in trade barriers.

However, we still find dumping and few other trade strategies of the exporting countries as a major hindrance to free and fair trade. Such behaviour has led to “contingent protection” as a tool of new-protectionism. Among the contingent protection <b>measures,</b> <b>anti-dumping</b> (AD) has evolved as the most popular choice of strategy for the trading nations. The AD policy invokes a threat to the exporter and thereby can change its strategic behaviour. We describe the phenomenon of dumping through a price-leadership model and thereby compute the optimal level of anti-dumping duty that can offset dumping. Using a sequential game, we conclude that the credible threat of an AD duty restricts dumping and thereby leads to a win-win situation for both the foreign and domestic firms. ...|$|R

40|$|World Trade Organization (WTO) {{members have}} long {{expressed}} a norm concerning the trade remedies of countervailing (anti-subsidy) duties and antidumping duties: that these measures offset the behavior that {{gives rise to}} them, restoring trade to a level playing field. The WTO agreements provide that the duties imposed should be calculated accordingly, that countervailing duties are measured against subsidies and <b>anti-dumping</b> duties are <b>measured</b> against the excess of a benchmark normal value over export price. This paper makes two principle contributions {{in light of this}} norm. First, it develops formal models of antidumping and countervailing duty actions conforming to the offsetting duty norm. Economists have often shown little patience with the rationale for these duties, leading to a dearth of formal analysis that takes into account the social welfare functionthe offsetting duty normincorporated in the WTO agreements; the formal models here provide that analysis. Second, the paper extends this analysis to the simultaneous prosecution of countervailing and antidumping cases. Once rare, simultaneous countervailing and antidumping duty proceedings have become perhaps the most prominent expression of trade protection permitted under WTO rules. The analysis establishes the conditions to identify any overlap in the application of countervailing and antidumping measures and demonstrates that recent practice of WTO members has created excessive application of duties. The analysis also provides the methods for preventing this double-count in simultaneous cases. These results have direct application to current policy debates. ...|$|R
