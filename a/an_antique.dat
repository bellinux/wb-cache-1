5|$|Bart {{explains}} that he knew Homer would probably change his mind, and decided to send the letter before that could happen. Homer desperately tries to prevent the letter from reaching Mr. Burns, but fails. Mr. Burns becomes furious and demands that Homer be beaten. However, Smithers calls off the beating {{on the grounds that}} is no way to thank the man who saved Mr. Burns' life, and instead convinces Mr. Burns to instead reward the Simpson family. The Simpsons receive <b>an</b> <b>antique</b> Xtapolapocetl, an Olmec head (a massive, Tiki-god-like affair) that Bart, the blood donor, likes, and which Homer hates.|$|E

5|$|Broad Ripple Park Carousel is <b>an</b> <b>antique</b> {{carousel}} in The Children's Museum of Indianapolis. It {{was installed}} in 1917 at an amusement park near the White River in Indianapolis, Indiana, where it remained until the building housing it collapsed in 1956. The ride's mechanism was destroyed, but the animals were relatively unscathed and put into storage by the park's owners, the Indianapolis Department of Parks and Recreation. The animals were carved by the Dentzel Carousel Company some time before 1900 but were assembled by the William F. Mangels carousel company, which also supplied the engine powering the ride.|$|E

The inner sleeve of the original LP in Britain contained a picture by Michael Putland, showing Harrison on a wintry beach in Cannes, where he was attending the Midem music-industry trade fair in January 1976. A third front-cover option came with MFP's budget reissue during the 1980s, which reproduced Harrison's 1968 White Album portrait.|$|E

5|$|The {{action in}} the book moves from Newby's life in the fashion {{business}} in London to Afghanistan. On the way Newby describes his very brief training in mountaineering in North Wales, a stop in Istanbul, and a nearly-disastrous drive across Turkey and Persia. They are driven out to the Panjshir Valley, where they begin their walk, with many small hardships described in a humorous narrative, supported by genuine history of Nuristan and brief descriptions of the rare moments of beauty along the way. Disagreements with Newby's Persian-speaking companion Hugh Carless, and odd phrases in <b>an</b> <b>antique</b> grammar book, are exploited to comic effect.|$|E
5|$|Three {{aspects of}} the {{painting}} {{can be attributed to}} <b>an</b> <b>antique</b> sardonyx cameo and a 15th-century relief from the circle of Donatello, available to Michelangelo in the Palazzo Medici: the circular form, the masculinity of Mary, and the positioning of the Christ Child. The Virgin’s right arm mirrors the arm of the satyr in the cameo, and the cameo also depicts an infant located on the shoulders of the satyr, a position similar to the Christ Child on Mary’s shoulders.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the novel}} uses fantastic elements, its main focus is a {{realistic}} {{portrayal of the}} excesses of bourgeois materialism. Balzac's renowned attention to detail is used to describe a gambling house, <b>an</b> <b>antique</b> shop, a royal banquet, and other locales. He also includes details from his own life as a struggling writer, placing the main character in a home {{similar to the one}} he occupied at the start of his literary career. The central theme of La Peau de chagrin is the conflict between desire and longevity. The magic skin represents the owner's life-force, which is depleted through every expression of will, especially when it is employed for the acquisition of power. Ignoring a caution from the shopkeeper who offers him the skin, the protagonist greedily surrounds himself with wealth, only to find himself miserable and decrepit at the story's end.|$|E

5|$|Located {{within the}} hamlet are a defunct, former dairy creamery {{and the site}} of the former Gardiner {{railroad}} station. Built in 1881 and opened the following year, the creamery was one of the dairies that transported its products to New York City by way of the Wallkill Valley Railroad. It was originally the property of the Borden family, but closed in the 1920s, and has since been renovated as an apartment complex. The former Gardiner railroad station ceased operations when the rail line closed. It became a sporting goods store by 1981, a video store by the early 1990s, and <b>an</b> <b>antique</b> store by 1995. The station burned down on October10, 2002.|$|E
5|$|Sightseers {{gathered}} on the bridge in the morning. George Henry Farnum, the owner of Okemah's only photography studio, took photographs, which were distributed as postcards, a common practice at the time. The district judge convened a grand jury, but the killers were never identified. Four of Farnum's photographs {{are known to have}} survived—two spectator scenes and one close-up view each of Laura and L.D. Three of the images were re-published in 2000 and exhibited at the Roth Horowitz Gallery in New York by James Allen, <b>an</b> <b>antique</b> collector. The images of Laura Nelson are the only known surviving photographs of a female lynching victim.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{between the}} older {{citizens}} of the Most Holy Redeemer Parish and the gays entering the Castro District were growing, however, and in 1973, when two gay men tried to open <b>an</b> <b>antique</b> shop, the Eureka Valley Merchants Association (EVMA) attempted {{to prevent them from}} receiving a business license. Milk and a few other gay business owners founded the Castro Village Association, with Milk as the president. He often repeated his philosophy that gays should buy from gay businesses. Milk organized the Castro Street Fair in 1974 to attract more customers to the area. More than 5,000 attended, and some of the EVMA members were stunned; they did more business at the Castro Street Fair than on any previous day.|$|E

5|$|The helmet {{appears to}} have been {{deliberately}} folded up and deposited in an artificial stone structure. It is thought to have been used for ceremonial occasions rather than for combat, and may already have been <b>an</b> <b>antique</b> {{by the time it was}} buried. It is of the same type as the Newstead Helmet (found in 1905) and its design also has similarities with the Ribchester Helmet (found in 1796) and the Hallaton Helmet (found in 2000), though its facial features are more akin to those of helmets found in southern Europe. Its design may allude to the Trojans, whose exploits the Romans re-enacted in cavalry tournaments.|$|E
5|$|Bond dispatches Sévérine's {{guards and}} sneaks aboard her boat. After he joins {{her in the}} shower, the two have sex. While {{approaching}} Silva's base on Dead Island, Sévérine becomes more afraid and tells Bond {{that it is not}} too late to retreat. However, they are taken prisoner by the guards, handcuffed and escorted through an abandoned city on the island. She explains to Bond that Silva made the natives believe a leak at the local chemical plant required them to evacuate the island. This allowed him to use it as his base of operations. Sévérine is separated from Bond, and is brutally beaten for her betrayal. After Bond is interrogated by Silva, he is taken to a courtyard, where Sévérine is bound to a statue. Silva places a shot glass of whiskey on her head, and challenges Bond to shoot it with <b>an</b> <b>antique</b> percussion cap pistol. Bond misses the target, and Silva responds by shooting her in the head.|$|E
5|$|Continuing north, {{the parkway}} {{encounters}} MD32 (Savage Road) near Fort Meade. MD32 offers northbound travelers direct access into the fort {{and to the}} National Security Agency, while the next interchange, another employee-only access road into Fort Meade, features only a southbound exit and northbound entrance. Fort Meade itself is a military installation opened in 1917 that trained 3.5 million troops during World War II and is still a major fort. To {{the west of the}} parkway off MD32 is the Savage Mill, which was an operating cotton mill from 1822 to 1947 and is currently <b>an</b> <b>antique</b> mall, and the Bollman Truss Railroad Bridge, an 1869 cast and wrought iron bridge along the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now CSX's Capital Subdivision) line between Baltimore and Washington D.C. After this interchange, the road continues to a cloverleaf interchange with MD175 (Jessup Road), where NPS maintenance of the parkway comes to an end {{at the south end of}} the interchange.|$|E

5|$|The Ballard Carnegie Library, {{also known}} until 1963 as the Seattle Public Library – Ballard Branch, is a {{historic}} library in the Ballard neighborhood in Seattle, Washington. The library was predated by a freeholders' library in the 1860s, which eventually {{gave way to a}} reading room that was organized and funded by a women's' group in 1901. With a grant for $15,000, among other funds, a new library for the then independent City of Ballard was created as a Carnegie library. The building, located at 2026 N.W. Market Street in downtown Ballard, opened to the public on June 24, 1904. Notable as the first major branch of the Seattle public library system, after Seattle annexed the City of Ballard into itself in 1907, and for employing one of the first African American librarians in Seattle, the Ballard Carnegie Library was in service until 1963, when a newer and more modern facility replaced it. After its sale, the old library building housed a variety of private commercial enterprises, including <b>an</b> <b>antique</b> shop, a restaurant and a kilt manufacturer.|$|E
