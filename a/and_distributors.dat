5|$|In the film, Koskov and Whitaker {{repeatedly}} use {{vehicles and}} drug packets {{marked with the}} Red Cross.

As a result, a disclaimer was added {{at the start of}} the film and some DVD releases.|$|E

Bethesda complied with the request but disagreed with the ESRB's rationale. Some retailers began to check for ID before selling Oblivion as a result, and one California Assemblyman used the event to criticize the ESRB's inefficiency.|$|E
5|$|The {{genesis of}} American Graffiti was in Lucas' own teenage years in early 1960s Modesto.

5|$|The CNSA {{became a}} major part of {{everyday}} life and culture in occupied Belgium. The organization fulfilled much of the day-to-day running of a welfare system and generally prevented famine, although food and material shortages were extremely common throughout the occupation. At its height, the CNSA had more than 125,000 agents <b>and</b> <b>distributors</b> across the country. Historians have described the CNSA itself, with its central committee and local networks across the country, as paralleling the actions of the official Belgian government in peacetime. In the eyes of contemporaries, the CNSA became a symbol of national unity and of passive resistance.|$|E
5|$|The {{failures}} of these titles were further compounded by Atari's business dealings from 1981. Confident in strong sales, {{the company had}} told its distributors to place their 1982 orders all at once. However, video game sales in 1982 had slowed, <b>and</b> <b>distributors</b> who had ordered en masse in expectation of high turnover were left to simply return large quantities of unsold stock to Atari. As a result, the company soon found itself in possession of several million essentially useless video game cartridges, which it would be entirely unable to sell.|$|E

5|$|In December 2014, Image {{published}} Saga Deluxe Edition Volume 1, a hardcover volume {{collecting the}} first 18 {{issues of the}} series, which comprise its first three story arcs. Because Vaughn sees Saga as a story about Hazel, he and Staples decided to have each new hardcover volume feature an original image of that character at a different stage of her life. Because the first volume covers her birth and infancy, its cover features a closeup of Hazel nursing from her mother's breast, set {{against the backdrop of}} Landfall and Wreath, which recalls the first issue's cover. Eric Stephenson warned Vaughn and Staples that some retailers <b>and</b> <b>distributors</b> would object to this cover image, thus limiting the series' audience, but after seeing Staples' rendition of the image, Stephenson decided that sales would not be a problem.|$|E
5|$|Released in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2011, The King's Speech {{was a major}} {{box office}} and {{critical}} success. Censors initially gave it adult ratings due to profanity, though these were later revised downwards after criticism by the makers <b>and</b> <b>distributors</b> in the UK and some instances of swearing were muted in the US. On a budget of £8million, it earned over £250million internationally ($400 million). It was widely praised by film critics for its visual style, art direction, and acting. Other commentators discussed the film's representation of historical detail, especially the reversal of Winston Churchill's opposition to abdication. The film received many awards and nominations, particularly for Colin Firth's performance; his Golden Globe Award for Best Actor was the sole win at that ceremony from seven nominations. The King's Speech won seven British Academy Film Awards, including Best Film, Best Actor (Firth), Best Supporting Actor (Rush), and Best Supporting Actress (Helena Bonham Carter). The film also won four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director (Hooper), Best Actor (Firth), and Best Original Screenplay (Seidler).|$|E
5|$|The {{amendment}} defined pornography as a {{civil rights}} violation against women, and allowed women who claimed harm from pornography to sue the producers <b>and</b> <b>distributors</b> in civil court for damages. The law was passed twice by the Minneapolis city council, but vetoed both times by Mayor Don Fraser, who considered {{the wording of the}} ordinance to be too vague. Another version of the ordinance passed in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1984, but was overturned as unconstitutional under the First Amendment by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in the case American Booksellers v. Hudnut. Dworkin continued to support the civil rights approach in her writing and activism, and supported anti-pornography feminists who organized later campaigns in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1985) and Bellingham, Washington (1988) to pass versions of the ordinance by voter initiative.|$|E
