25|$|In the {{following}} week, {{it became clear}} that a tie on Super Tuesday left Obama better positioned for the upcoming contests in February, where the demographics of several large states seemed to favor him. The day after Super Tuesday, February 6, Clinton announced that she had personally lent her campaign $5 million in January. The news came as a surprise and set off another round of news stories <b>about</b> <b>Clinton</b> donors and supporters concerned about the campaign's strategy. It was particularly striking in contrast to Obama's announcement that he had raised a record-high $32 million in January, tapping 170,000 new contributors. It became clear that Obama's financial advantage had allowed him to organize and compete in a broader set of states on Super Tuesday, an advantage likely to continue in the coming weeks and months. Clinton's supporters responded by raising $6 million online in 36 hours, but Obama's campaign upped the ante, announcing their own total of $7.5 million in 36 hours and starting a new goal of reaching 500,000 new contributors in 2008 by the end of February.|$|E
500|$|Over {{a hundred}} books and {{scholarly}} works {{have been written}} <b>about</b> <b>Clinton,</b> from many perspectives. A 2006 survey by the New York Observer found [...] "a virtual cottage industry" [...] of [...] "anti-Clinton literature", put out by Regnery Publishing and other conservative imprints, with titles such as , Hillary's Scheme: Inside the Next Clinton's Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House and Can She Be Stopped?: Hillary Clinton Will Be the Next President of the United States Unless ... Books praising Clinton did not sell nearly as well (other than the memoirs written by her and her husband). When she ran for Senate in 2000, a number of fundraising groups such as Save Our Senate and the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprang up to oppose her. Van Natta found that Republican and conservative groups viewed her as a reliable [...] "bogeyman" [...] to mention in fundraising letters, {{on a par with}} Ted Kennedy and the equivalent of Democratic and liberal appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich.|$|E

500|$|Going {{into the}} early stages of her presidential {{campaign}} for 2008, a Time magazine cover showed a large picture of her, with two checkboxes labeled [...] "Love Her", [...] "Hate Her", while Mother Jones titled its profile of her [...] "Harpy, Hero, Heretic: Hillary". Democratic netroots activists consistently rated Clinton very low in polls of their desired candidates, while some conservative figures such as Bruce Bartlett and Christopher Ruddy were declaring a Hillary Clinton presidency not so bad after all. An October 2007 cover of The American Conservative magazine was titled [...] "The Waning Power of Hillary Hate". By December 2007, communications professor Jamieson observed that there was a large amount of misogyny present <b>about</b> <b>Clinton</b> on the Internet, up to and including instances on Facebook and other sites devoted to depictions reducing Clinton to sexual humiliation. She noted, in response to widespread comments on Clinton's laugh, that [...] "We know that there's language to condemn female speech that doesn't exist for male speech. We call women's speech shrill and strident. And Hillary Clinton's laugh was being described as a cackle." [...] The [...] "bitch" [...] epithet, which had been applied to Clinton going back to her first lady days and had been seen by Karrin Vasby Anderson as a tool of containment against women in American politics, flourished during the campaign, especially on the Internet but via conventional media as well. Following Clinton's [...] "choked up moment" [...] and related incidents {{in the run-up to the}} January 2008 New Hampshire primary, both The New York Times and Newsweek found that discussion of gender's role in the campaign had moved into the national political discourse. Newsweek editor Jon Meacham summed the relationship between Clinton and the American public by saying that the New Hampshire events [...] "brought an odd truth to light: though Hillary Rodham Clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades ... she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in American politics." ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 6, 2012, Obama was re-elected for {{a second}} term as president.

[...] Despite her continuing to express a lack of interest, speculation continued <b>about</b> <b>Clinton</b> as a possible candidate in the 2016 presidential election. A poll taken in Iowa, the first state in the nomination process, showed that in a hypothetical 2016 caucuses contest, Clinton would have 58percent support, with Vice President Biden coming in next at 17percent.|$|E

Broaddrick's only sworn testimony <b>about</b> <b>Clinton</b> was a previous denial of any harassment by Clinton. [...] Gennifer Flowers, Elizabeth Ward Gracen, Sally Perdue and Dolly Kyle Browning â€“ claimed to have had adulterous sexual relations with Clinton during or before his service as governor. Gracen later apologized to Hillary Clinton for having sex with Bill. [...] After Gracen made her claim, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr issued a subpoena to have her testify in court.

[...] After {{endorsing}} Obama, Morrison distanced herself from her 1998 remark <b>about</b> <b>Clinton,</b> {{saying that it was}} misunderstood. She alleged that she has [...] "no idea what his real instincts are, in terms of race" [...] and claimed she was only describing the way he was being treated during the impeachment trial as an equivalent to a poor black person living in the ghetto. Obama himself, when asked in a Democratic debate about Morrison's declaration of Clinton as [...] "black", replied that Clinton had an enormous [...] "affinity" [...] with the black community, but joked he would need to see Clinton's dancing ability before judging him to be black.|$|E

[...] She also said that [...] "We know that there's language to condemn female speech that doesn't exist for male speech. We call women's speech shrill and strident. And Hillary Clinton's laugh was being described as a cackle," [...] making reference to a flurry of media coverage two months prior about the physical nature and political motivation of her aural indication of amusement. Tanya Romaniuk also described how [...] "the news media reshaped the kinds of meanings and values attached to" [...] Clinton's 'cackle' characterization, [...] "and concomitantly (re)produced and reinforced a stereotypically gendered, negative (i.e., sexist, misogynist) perception of her." ...|$|E
