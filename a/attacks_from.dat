5|$|Although {{generally}} a peaceful bird, which lives quite happily alongside humans, the willie wagtail will defend its nest aggressively. Willie wagtails {{are known to}} swoop at passers by, much like the Australian magpie. While <b>attacks</b> <b>from</b> willie wagtails are not as common or as formidable as the magpie, they do come as a great shock to recipients.|$|E
5|$|Gen. Lee {{arrived on}} the {{battlefield}} at about 2:30 p.m., as Rodes's men were in mid-attack. Seeing that a major assault was underway, he lifted his restriction on a general engagement and gave permission to Hill to resume his <b>attacks</b> <b>from</b> the morning. First in line was Heth's division again, with two fresh brigades: Pettigrew's North Carolinians and Col. John M. Brockenbrough's Virginians.|$|E
50|$|At dusk on November 24, 1948, {{the communists}} {{launched}} their full-scale attack in three fronts. In the western front, the 3rd Column {{of the communist}} Central China Field Army <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> Sunding Village (Sundingji, 孫町集), the 1st Column of the communist Central China Field Army <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> Five Ditch Village (Wugouji, 五溝集), the 2nd Column of the communist Central China Field Army <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> White Sand Village (Baishaji, 白沙集), and the 6th Column of the communist Central China Field Army <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> Cao's Market Village (Caoshiji, 曹市集). In the eastern front, the 11th Column of the communist Central China Field Army <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> Jin County Village (Jinxianji, 靳縣集). In the northern front, the 4th Column of the communist Central China Field Army <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> the region of Wu Family's Lake (Wujiahu, 伍家湖), and the 9th Column of the communist Central China Field Army <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> the region of Shao's House with Roof Tiles (Shaowafang, 邵瓦房). By the early morning of November 25, 1948, the nationalist 12th Army was surrounded in a 7.5 km wide region centered at Shuangdui Village (Shuangduiji, 雙堆集).|$|R
50|$|When <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> above, and {{therefore}} not {{in a good position}} to bite the attacker, either gender will autohaemorrhage more than when <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> the side.|$|R
25|$|On 30 August, the Iraqi Army, Shi'ite {{militias and}} Peshmerga started a {{campaign}} to break the siege, after the speaker of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Abdul-Mahdi al-Karabalai, called to move and break the siege by ISIS on the town. The forces <b>attacked</b> ISIS <b>from</b> three areas, the army <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> the south of Amirli in Adhaim, the Peshmerga <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> the north in Tuz Khormato, the militias <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> the east in Kifri.|$|R
5|$|Holding {{positions}} {{north of}} the crucial city of Taegu, the US Army's 1st Cavalry Division stood {{at the center of}} the Pusan Perimeter defensive line, tasked with keeping the United Nations Command headquarters secured from <b>attacks</b> <b>from</b> the North Korean People's Army. On September 1, the NK 3rd Division attacked as part of the Great Naktong Offensive.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009 Pakistani {{authorities}} {{confirmed that}} LeT plotted and financed the <b>attacks</b> <b>from</b> LeT camps in Karachi and Thatta. In November 2009, Pakistani authorities charged seven men they had arrested earlier, {{of planning and}} executing the assault.|$|E
5|$|Militarily, the {{location}} makes sense {{as a place}} where refugees and the southwestern Brythons of Dumnonia could have defended themselves against <b>attacks</b> <b>from</b> the east. If Arthur was indeed conceived at Tintagel, as tradition asserts, he may have been a prince of Dumnonia and used Cadbury as a stronghold on his eastern frontier.|$|E
5000|$|If <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> the rear, {{the ranks}} reverse order, so the rear rank now becomes the front. If <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> the flank, the {{opposite}} flank {{now serves as}} the rear rank.|$|R
50|$|The {{state of}} Pannai, {{according}} to inscriptions found in India, fell after a surprise <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> the rear. Pannai did not suspect an <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> a Chola occupied Srivijaya, the mandala's capital.|$|R
50|$|<b>Attack</b> <b>from</b> Mars is {{available}} as a licensed table of The Pinball Arcade for several platforms. <b>Attack</b> <b>from</b> Mars was {{also included in the}} arcade game UltraPin. Unlicensed recreations of the game are available for Visual Pinball.|$|R
5|$|Needled by {{repeated}} <b>attacks</b> <b>from</b> The Morning Chronicle on his supposed indecency, poor {{taste and}} lack of creativity, Etty determined to produce a work that would prove his detractors wrong. The result was The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate.|$|E
5|$|On the {{following}} day, General Dong's forces staged their <b>attacks</b> <b>from</b> two main directions, from Thanh Hoi and Tich Tuong-Nhu Le, moving along Route 68 and National Highway 1 respectively. The North Vietnamese 2nd Army Corps, {{on the other}} hand, assaulted South Vietnamese positions in Phu Loc and Phu Gia.|$|E
5|$|Park did {{not send}} {{all of his}} forces aloft, and he held a reserve. Three Squadrons at RAF Tangmere were kept and made ready to meet more <b>attacks</b> <b>from</b> the south. Six more were in reserve to meet a {{possible}} follow-up to the coming raid.|$|E
5000|$|First, [...] "fight modifiers" [...] are determined. Examples include: For each extra opponent, a {{character}} earns (-1); if {{the character is}} being <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> behind, they earn (-1); if {{a character}} is <b>attacking</b> <b>from</b> behind, they earn (+1). The fight modifiers change the dice a player uses. For example, a character that would use a red fight die according to their character card would use a yellow die if they were <b>attacking</b> <b>from</b> behind.|$|R
50|$|When pinball {{designer}} Steve Ritchie {{was asked}} about the design similarities between his Spider-Man pinball machine and Eddys <b>Attack</b> <b>From</b> Mars, Ritchie admitted that he had designed Spider-Mans playfield as an homage to Eddy, and specifically to <b>Attack</b> <b>From</b> Mars.|$|R
50|$|At 06:05 on {{the morning}} 12 November, as LCol Shuffer's forces {{prepared}} to start patrolling Highway 13, the Viet Cong launched their attack. Starting with a barrage of 50 mortar rounds, a Battalion of Viet Cong <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> the southwest. The attack was quickly met by return fire from Troop A's M113s which broke up the attack. A second <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> the south and a third <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> the southeast were similarly beaten back by the waiting American force.|$|R
5|$|Sandakan {{is one of}} the six {{districts that}} is {{involved}} in the Eastern Sabah Security Command (ESSCOM), a dusk to dawn sea curfew which had been enforced since 19 July 2014 by the Malaysian government to repel <b>attacks</b> <b>from</b> militant groups in the Southern Philippines.|$|E
5|$|The Syrians {{responded by}} {{launching}} about 100 fighter aircraft {{to stop the}} attacks. Intercepting IAF pilots relied frequently on VHF radio, in hopes of preserving their tactical communications and links to the command post. Selective airborne communications jamming disrupted the airwaves for the MiG-21s and MiG-23s and cut them off from ground control, making them vulnerable to AWACS-directed <b>attacks</b> <b>from</b> the Israeli F-15s and F-16s.|$|E
5|$|This time Thomas {{planned to}} launch {{simultaneous}} sorties from four gates. The main sector {{was to be}} again the Thomas gate, {{to take full advantage}} of the exhausted Muslim corps stationed there. The <b>attacks</b> <b>from</b> the other gates—Jabiya Gate, the Small Gate and the Eastern Gate—were intended to tie down the other Muslim corps so that they could not aid Shurhabil's corps at the Thomas gate.|$|E
50|$|On July 17, Gourko <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> {{the north}} with four {{divisions}}. The two flank divisions captured mountain positions {{but the two}} divisions in the center were repulsed. On the 18th Gourko <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> the south. Again the main attack on the pass was repulsed but the Russians carried some of the trenches. Gourko planned a combined <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> {{the north and the}} south on the 19th. The next day however the Ottoman forces evacuated the pass and Russia took possession of it.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] Hill {{overlooking}} Sandy Hollow, where Gen. Stephen's Division deployed on the {{far right}} flank of the Continental Army. The Jagers <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> {{the right side of the}} photograph, while the light infantry <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> the current-day tree line, at the left and center.|$|R
5|$|Union {{infantry}} <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> {{the east}} side of the battlefield, while most of the cavalry <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> the south and west. Capehart's brigade <b>attacked</b> <b>from</b> the southwest, and eventually was on the extreme western side of the battlefield. At times, the cavalry fought dismounted, with their horses led at a safe distance behind. The opposing forces were always within range of the Union cavalry carbines, keeping the weapon's seven-shot advantage—and not enabling the Confederate infantry to utilize the advantage of their longer range weapons.|$|R
5|$|Another {{innovation}} was Boost Mode: a two-player, side-scrolling, arcade-style beat 'em up mode {{not included}} in the arcade version, in which a player fights enemy waves to accumulate items, health and experience. For the Xbox, this mode was adapted for online play with Xbox Live, supporting up to 16 players. Experience points from Boost Mode can be used in the new Robo-Ky II Factory mode, in which a player can customize a robot named Robo-Ky II by teaching him moves, combos, or one of 65 special <b>attacks</b> <b>from</b> other characters. In addition to the attacks, other aspects such as jump height, offense, defense, recovery time, tension, and speed can be improved.|$|E
5|$|Australian coastwatchers {{stationed}} on New Britain were reinforced during September and October 1943 {{to provide}} warning of air <b>attacks</b> <b>from</b> Rabaul {{bound for the}} Allied landing sites and to report on Japanese barge and troop movements. In addition to a coastwatching team already in place at Cape Orford near Wide Bay, five other parties were sent to Cape Hoskins, Gasmata, Open Bay (on the north coast {{at the base of}} the Gazelle Peninsula), the area south of Wide Bay, and the neck between Wide Bay and Open Bay. The Gasmata party was discovered by the Japanese while en route to its destination and eliminated, but the other teams were in place by the end of October.|$|E
5|$|Batista {{had come}} under {{increasing}} pressure by 1958. His army's military failures, coupled with his press censorship {{and the police}} and army's use of torture and extrajudicial executions, were increasingly criticized both domestically and abroad. Influenced by anti-Batista sentiment among their citizens, the U.S. government ceased supplying him with weaponry, leading him to buy arms from the United Kingdom. The opposition used this opportunity to call a general strike, accompanied by armed <b>attacks</b> <b>from</b> the MR-26-7. Beginning on 9 April, it received strong support {{in central and eastern}} Cuba, but little elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the First World War, {{for the first time since}} the Napoleonic Wars, the {{population}} of the British Isles was in danger of <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> naval raids. The country also came under <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> air raids by zeppelins and fixed-wing aircraft, another first.|$|R
50|$|Atlantic Rim (also {{known as}} <b>Attack</b> <b>from</b> Beneath, <b>Attack</b> <b>from</b> the Atlantic Rim and From the Sea) is a 2013 American science fiction monster film {{produced}} by The Asylum {{and directed by}} Jared Cohn. Shot in Pensacola, Florida, the film stars Graham Greene, David Chokachi, Treach, and Jackie Moore.|$|R
50|$|The game places {{emphasis}} on building alliances with other players, those {{who fail to}} form alliances are vulnerable to massed <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> multiple rival players. Alliances can attempt to capture resources as a group, or send reinforcements should one of their number come under <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> a rival.|$|R
5|$|Canada's strong {{attachment}} to the British Empire and Commonwealth led to major participation in British military efforts in the Second Boer War, World War I and World War II. Since then, Canada has been an advocate for multilateralism, making efforts to resolve global issues in collaboration with other nations. During the Cold War, Canada was {{a major contributor to}} UN forces in the Korean War and founded the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) in co-operation with the United States to defend against potential aerial <b>attacks</b> <b>from</b> the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Castro's guerrillas {{increased}} their attacks on military outposts, forcing {{the government to}} withdraw from the Sierra Maestra region, and by spring 1958, the rebels controlled a hospital, schools, a printing press, slaughterhouse, land-mine factory and a cigar-making factory. By 1958, Batista was under increasing pressure, a result of his military failures coupled with increasing domestic and foreign criticism surrounding his administration's press censorship, torture, and extrajudicial executions. Influenced by anti-Batista sentiment among their citizens, the U.S. government ceased supplying him with weaponry. The opposition called a general strike, accompanied by armed <b>attacks</b> <b>from</b> the MR-26-7. Beginning on April 9, it received strong support in central and eastern Cuba, but little elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Cleph {{kept his}} throne for only 18 months before being assassinated by a slave. An {{important}} {{success for the}} Byzantines was that no king was proclaimed to succeed him, opening a decade of interregnum and making the Lombards who remained in Italy more vulnerable to <b>attacks</b> <b>from</b> Franks and Byzantines. It was only {{when faced with the}} danger of annihilation by the Franks in 584 that the Lombard dukes elected a new king in the person of Authari, son of Cleph, who began the definitive consolidation and centralization of the Lombard kingdom.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the night}} of 3–4 September more German attacks were repelled. On September 4 a German torpedo boat T-196 (ex G196) made a {{surprise}} <b>attack</b> <b>from</b> the seaside.
