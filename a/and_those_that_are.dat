5|$|LARP {{events have}} {{a wide variety of}} styles that often overlap. Simple distinctions can be made {{regarding}} the genre used, the presence of simulated weapons or abstract rules, and whether players create their own characters or have them assigned by gamemasters. There is also a distinction between scenarios that are only run once <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> designed to be repeatable. A number of other common classifications follow.|$|E
5|$|Bronchial {{injuries}} {{are divided into}} those that are accompanied by a disruption of the pleura <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not; in the former, air can leak from {{the hole in the}} airway and a pneumothorax can form. The latter type is associated with more minor signs; pneumothorax is small if it occurs at all, and although function is lost in the part of the lung supplied by the injured bronchus, unaffected parts of the lungs may be able to compensate.|$|E
5|$|In a 1960 paper, American {{astronomer}} Olin J. Eggen {{concluded that}} Capella {{was a member}} of the Hyades moving group, a group of stars moving in the same direction as the Hyades cluster, after analysing its proper motion and parallax. Members of the group are of a similar age, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun have moved off the main sequence after exhausting their core hydrogen reserves and are expanding and cooling into red giants.|$|E

5|$|Niobium in the Earth's crust {{comprises}} one stable isotope, 93Nb. By 2003, {{at least}} 32 radioisotopes had been synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 81 to 113. The most stable {{of these is}} 92Nb with a half-life of 34.7million years. One of the least stable is 113Nb, with an estimated half-life of 30milliseconds. Isotopes that are lighter than the stable 93Nb tend to decay by β+ decay, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> heavier tend to decay by β− decay, with some exceptions. 81Nb, 82Nb, and 84Nb have minor β+ delayed proton emission decay paths, 91Nb decays by electron capture and positron emission, and 92Nb decays by both β+ and β− decay.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{as a whole}} exhibit {{varying levels}} of fluency in the Khmer and Vietnamese languages. Vietnamese that live in {{self-contained}} fishing communities along the Tonle Sap use Vietnamese in their day-to-day conversations and have individuals that have limited Khmer language skills <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> bilingual in both languages. On the other hand, Vietnamese that live in predominantly Khmer-speaking neighbourhoods {{send their children to}} public schools, and as a result the children are able to speak Khmer fluently but show very limited understanding of Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|The area is {{also home}} to many desserts, ranging from those made {{regularly}} <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> commonly reserved for the holidays. Most Palestinian sweets are pastries filled with either sweetened cheeses, dates or various nuts such as almonds, walnuts or pistachios. Beverages could also depend on holidays such as during Ramadan, where carob, tamarind and apricot juices are consumed at sunset. Coffee is consumed throughout the day and liquor is not very prevalent among the population, however, some alcoholic beverages such as arak or beer are consumed by Christians and less conservative Muslims.|$|E

50|$|Roman doctors {{separated}} {{mental disorders}} into two categories: <b>those</b> <b>that</b> could <b>be</b> cured, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> {{not of the}} body. Amongst the latter were addictions, most commonly vinolentia (alcoholism).|$|R
50|$|The musical {{works of}} Friedrich Burgmüller are listed below. The list {{is divided into}} works given an Opus number by the {{composer}} <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not.|$|R
5|$|The {{novel is}} a {{combination}} of fact and fiction. Blending together these two elements is important in any historical novel, but especially in The Feast of the Goat because Vargas Llosa chose to narrate an actual event through the minds of both real and fictional characters. Some characters are fictional, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> non-fictional still have fictionalized aspects in the book. The general details of the assassination are true, and the assassins are all real people. While they lie in wait for the Dictator to arrive, they recount actual crimes of the regime, such as the murder of the Mirabal sisters. However, other details are invented by Vargas Llosa, such as Amadito's murder of the brother of the woman he loved.|$|E
5|$|The {{mating system}} of {{pinnipeds}} varies from extreme polygyny to serial monogamy. Of the 33 species, 20 breed on land, {{and the remaining}} 13 breed on ice. Species that breed on land are usually polygynous, as females gather in large aggregations and males are able to mate with {{them as well as}} defend them from rivals. Polygynous species include elephant seals, grey seals and most otariids. Land-breeding pinnipeds tend to mate on islands where there are fewer terrestrial predators. Few islands are favorable for breeding, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> tend to be crowded. Since the land they breed on is fixed, females return to the same sites for many years. The males arrive earlier in the season and wait for them. The males stay on land and try to mate with as many females as they can; some of them will even fast. If a male leaves the beach to feed, he will likely lose mating opportunities and his dominance. Polygynous species also tend to be extremely sexual dimorphic in favor of males. This dimorphism manifests itself in larger chests and necks, longer canines and denser fur—all traits that help males in fights for females. Increased body weight in males increases the length of time they can fast due to the ample energy reserves stored in the blubber. Larger males also likely enjoy access to feeding grounds that smaller ones are unable to access due to their lower thermoregulatory ability and decreased energy stores. In some instances, only the largest males are able to reach the furthest deepest foraging grounds where they enjoy maximum energetic yields that are unavailable to smaller males and females.|$|E

Networked games (as opposed to online games) were still extremely rare in the late 1980s, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> available were generally fairly simple.

25|$|Running rigging is {{the rigging}} of a sailing vessel {{that is used}} for raising, lowering, shaping and {{controlling}} the sails on a sailing vessel—as opposed to the standing rigging, which supports the mast and bowsprit.

25|$|In Singapore, {{the sources}} of {{constitutional}} law may be grouped into two categories: those that are legally binding <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not. Legally binding sources include {{the text of the}} Constitution, judicial interpretations of the Constitution, and other statutes. Non-binding sources are influences on constitutional law such as soft law, constitutional conventions, and public international law.|$|E
25|$|The {{tools and}} {{techniques}} of ornithology are varied and new inventions and approaches are quickly incorporated.
