25|$|At-will {{employment}} disclaimers are {{a staple}} of employee handbooks in the United States.

However, the National Labor Relations Board has opposed as unlawful the practice of including in such disclaimers language declaring that the at-will nature of the employment cannot be changed without the written consent of senior management.|$|E

25|$|It {{is rather}} universally {{accepted}} that {{a body of}} Shakespeare's sonnets, including 65, are addressed {{to a young man}} whose beauty the poems make known. The young man is like Caesar, then, in that Shakespeare recognizes the presence of feminine qualities in a man. But the common theme is more than recognition, it is <b>an</b> <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>of</b> tension created by that recognition. Especially by Cassius, Caesar is made out to be rather feminine, as is the young man in descriptions of his beauty. In that the speaker does not directly refer to the addressee of the sonnets as a man, and in that Brutus and the others find discomfort in Caesar's ruling ability because of his appeared weaknesses, shows that Shakespeare recognizes an anxiety about men with feminine qualities, or women with masculine qualities, like Queen Elizabeth, of whom Caesar {{may or may not be}} representative.|$|E

500|$|A side {{benefit of}} Tchaikovsky's {{friendship}} with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov was an increased {{confidence in his}} own abilities as a composer, along with a willingness to let his musical works stand alongside those of his contemporaries.

[...] Coward firmly believed his private business was not for public discussion, considering [...] "any sexual activities when over-advertised" [...] to be tasteless. Even in the 1960s, Coward refused to acknowledge his sexual orientation publicly, wryly observing, [...] "There are still a few old ladies in Worthing who don't know." [...] Despite this reticence, he encouraged his secretary Cole Lesley to write a frank biography once Coward was safely dead.|$|E

Network vice-president Robert Chandler dismissed the bulk of Alfred's complaints as [...] "trivial, irrelevant or clearly represent matters of opinion or judgment". Chandler went on to acknowledge that the applause was broadcast out of sequence but denied that it was intended to deceive. [...] "Whatever the motivation, it is clear that our producers indicated the applause out of its actual time sequence and therefore misled our viewers. This, then, constitutes <b>an</b> <b>acknowledgment</b> <b>of</b> error and an apology for a breach of our own journalistic standards."
