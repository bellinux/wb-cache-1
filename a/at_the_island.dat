5|$|A week later, Kratos arrives <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Delos and {{explores the}} ruined statue of Apollo. He is {{attacked}} by all three Furies and is eventually captured. Orkos appears and frees Kratos, transporting him to another location. Orkos gives Kratos his Oath Stone and reveals {{that he and}} Aletheia tried to warn Zeus of Ares' and the Furies' plan. In retaliation, they took the Oracle's eyes, the objects Kratos seeks. After a perilous journey, Kratos uses the Amulet of Uroborus to restore the statue and retrieve the eyes. On completing the Trials of Archimedes, Kratos is ambushed and captured by the Furies, who confiscate all of his items.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to her unit, Alaska continued to screen for the aircraft carriers off Okinawa. On 27 March she was detached to conduct a bombardment of Minamidaitō. She was joined by Guam, two light cruisers, and Destroyer Squadron 47. On the night of 2728 March, she fired forty-five 12-inch shells and three hundred and fifty-two 5-inch rounds <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> The ships rejoined TG 58.4 at a refueling point, after which they returned to Okinawa to support the landings when they began on 1 April. On the evening of 11 April, Alaska shot down one Japanese plane, assisted {{in the destruction of}} another, and claimed what might have been an Ohka piloted rocket-bomb. On 16 April, the ship shot down another three aircraft and assisted with three others. Throughout the rest of the month, her heavy anti-aircraft fire succeeded in driving off Japanese bombers.|$|E

5|$|All four {{ships of}} the class entered service {{in time to see}} action during the Third Italian War of Independence against the Austrian Navy in 1866. Persano, now the {{commander}} of the Italian fleet, adopted a cautious strategy and conducted only one major offensive operation, which was directed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Lissa. There, the Austrian fleet under Wilhelm von Tegetthoff attacked the Italians. The four Regina Maria Pias all took part in the ensuing Battle of Lissa. Regina Maria Pia had been set on fire and badly burned in the battle, and minor fires were started by Austrian shells aboard San Martino and Castelfidardo, but neither were seriously damaged. Ancona emerged relatively unscathed, with only minor damage to her iron plates.|$|E
5|$|Dates {{are also}} {{relevant}} to this autobiographical reading. According to the text, Pym arrives <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Tsalal on January 19 — Poe's birthday. Scholars, including Burton R. Pollin and Richard Wilbur, suggest that the character of Augustus was based on Poe's childhood friend Ebenezer Burling or on Poe's brother William Henry Leonard Poe, who served in South America and elsewhere as a sailor aboard the USS Macedonian. In the novel, the date of Augustus's death corresponds {{to that of the}} death of Poe's brother. The first chapter features Pym's sloop named the Ariel, the name of a character once played by Poe's mother Eliza Poe, and also the name of Percy Bysshe Shelley's boat, on which he died, originally named Don Juan in honor of Lord Byron.|$|E

Following the Italian Armistice in early September 1943, Albona and Rovigno were captured by the Germans <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Syros in the Aegean Sea on 10 September. They were renamed Netztender 57 and Netztender 56 respectively, and their armament was improved. Laurana was captured at Venice on 11 September, and was commissioned by the Germans under her Italian name on 30 September, after which she served as a minelayer in the Adriatic. She retained her Italian armament. Netztender 57 and Netztender 56 were scuttled by the Germans at Salonika on 31 October 1944, and Laurana was sunk at Trieste by aircraft bombs on 20 February 1945.|$|E

The gunfire hit her superstructure, and caused 69 casualties (18 killed, 51 wounded). After a few repairs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Ulithi, she joined in the pre-invasion shelling group for the invasion of Okinawa at Kerama Retto. She stayed at Okinawa until 22 May, providing anti-aircraft cover and fire support for the invasion troops. On 6 August, she {{returned to}} the occupied Okinawa to sail to Japan for its occupation.

5|$|The Iago sparrow {{was first}} {{collected}} by Charles Darwin {{during the first}} stop of the second voyage of HMS Beagle <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Santiago (St. Iago). It was described for him in 1837 by zoologist John Gould, in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London, and given the name of Pyrgita iagoensis. By the time Gould wrote The Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle with Darwin and three other zoologists in 1841, he had placed the Iago sparrow in the genus Passer, where it remains. The genus, among the sparrows of the Old World in the family Passeridae, also contains at least 20 other species, among them the house sparrow and Eurasian tree sparrow.|$|E

5|$|The most {{recently}} carved hieroglyphic inscription of ancient Egypt known today {{is found in}} a temple of Philae, dated precisely to 394 AD {{during the reign of}} Theodosius I (r. 379–395 AD). In the 4th century AD, the Hellenized Egyptian Horapollo compiled a survey of almost two hundred Egyptian hieroglyphs and provided his interpretation of their meanings, although his understanding was limited and he was unaware of the phonetic uses of each hieroglyph. This survey was apparently lost until 1415, when the Italian Cristoforo Buondelmonti acquired it <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Andros. Athanasius Kircher (1601–1680) was the first in Europe to realize that Coptic was a direct linguistic descendant of ancient Egyptian.

5|$|Writing {{after the}} fall of Nojpetén, friar Cano {{described}} the ultimate fate of Díaz de Velasco and his companions; he claimed to have received the information from interviews with the soldiers from Yucatán who had stormed the Itza capital and from Ch'ol witnesses, although there were no Ch'ol at Nojpetén. Díaz's party arrived at the lakeshore and were told by local Itza that Franciscan friars were at Nojpetén. They were wary at first and asked for proof, upon which an Itza messenger brought them a rosary as a token. Looking across the lake they saw men dressed as friars calling to them to come across, these were Itza dressed in the habits of the two Franciscans who had recently been killed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> Díaz and his companions then boarded the Itza canoes, leaving thirty Maya porters with their mules and supplies.|$|E
5|$|By {{the sixth}} {{year of the}} revolt (494 BC), the Persian forces had regrouped. The {{available}} land forces were gathered into one army, and were accompanied by a fleet supplied by the re-subjugated Cypriots, and the Egyptians, Cilicians and Phoenicians. The Persians headed directly to Miletus, paying little attention to other strongholds, presumably intending to tackle the revolt at its centre. The Ionians sought to defend Miletus by sea, leaving the defense of Miletus to the Milesians. The Ionian fleet gathered <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Lade, {{off the coast of}} Miletus.

Satoru reviews his theory regarding Inubushi; he thinks that she, too, was experiencing the transfer phenomenon, and that her consciousness ended up at Mount Akakura in the dying body of Hotori. He thinks the consciousness of Hotori inhabited Inubushi's body, rendering it free of homicidal tendencies, but realizes that since both his and Inubushi's consciousnesses remain <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> Hotori cannot occupy Inubushi's body when he occupies his; Cocoro runs towards Inubushi, who is holding Utsumi's infant child {{over the edge of}} a cliff while singing.

5|$|Katsuragis keel {{was laid}} down by the Kure Naval Arsenal in Kure, Hiroshima, on 8 December 1942. She was {{launched}} on 19 January 1944 and completed on 15 October 1944.

Her flight deck was disguised with fake trees, houses and roads; however, her anti-aircraft batteries remained fully manned. Her intended air group, Air Group 601, was committed to the Battle of Iwo Jima about that same time. On 19 March, the ship was attacked by aircraft from Task Force 58 and lightly damaged by several rocket hits; one man was killed and three wounded in the attack.

5|$|On 15 October 1904, she {{set sail}} for Port Arthur from Libau {{along with the}} other vessels of the Second Pacific Squadron, under the command of Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky. When his ships reached the port of Tangier, Morocco, on 28 October, Rozhestvensky split his forces and ordered his older ships, {{including}} Navarin and Sissoi Veliky, to proceed through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal to rendezvous with him in Madagascar as previously planned. Under the command of Rear Admiral Dmitry von Fölkersam, they departed that night and reached Souda Bay, Crete, a week later and Port Said, Egypt two weeks after that. The two forces reunited <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Nosy Be on 9 January 1905 where they remained for two months while Rozhestvensky finalized his coaling arrangements.

The latter ships reached Camranh Bay on 9 May and the combined force sailed for Vladivostok on 14 May.|$|E
5|$|Other {{possibilities}} {{to synthesize}} nuclei {{on the island}} of stability include quasifission (partial fusion followed by fission) of a massive nucleus. Such nuclei tend to fission, expelling doubly magic or nearly doubly magic fragments such as calcium-40, tin-132, lead-208, or bismuth-209. Recently {{it has been shown that}} the multi-nucleon transfer reactions in collisions of actinide nuclei (such as uranium and curium) might be used to synthesize the neutron-rich superheavy nuclei located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of stability, although formation of the lighter elements nobelium or seaborgium is more favored. One last possibility to synthesize isotopes near the island is to use controlled nuclear explosions to create a neutron flux high enough to bypass the gaps of instability at 258–260Fm and at mass number 275 (atomic numbers 104 to 108), mimicking the r-process in which the actinides were first produced in nature and the gap of instability around radon bypassed. Some such isotopes (especially 291Cn and 293Cn) may even have been synthesized in nature, but would have decayed away far too quickly (with half-lives of only thousands of years) and be produced in far too small quantities (about 10−12 the abundance of lead) to be detectable as primordial nuclides today outside cosmic rays.|$|E
