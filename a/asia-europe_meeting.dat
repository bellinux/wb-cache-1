The year he was elected, Sharif made a state visit to Malaysia and Singapore where Sharif signed economic and free trade agreements with both countries. It was a trilateral trade bloc in South Asia and premiers of Singapore, Malaysia, and Pakistan had successfully signed the agreement. Following the agreement, the work on comprehensive framework to enhance collaboration in defence, economic and private sector was launched and completed in 1998. One of the core issues was Malaysia's agreement on sharing its space technology to Pakistan. Both Malaysia and Singapore assured their support for Pakistan to join <b>Asia–Europe</b> <b>Meeting.</b> However, {{it was not until}} 2008, Pakistan and India became part of the treaty.|$|E

In the wake of the ROKS Cheonan sinking, a joint declaration was issued by the G-8 leaders condemning the North. President Lee succeeded in bringing the Cheonan incident to the forefront in the Chair's Statement for the <b>Asia-Europe</b> <b>Meeting</b> in 2010 at Brussels, drawing member nation support for the South Korean government's stance on North Korea's nuclear issue and stability in Northeast Asia. In addition, President Lee urged Japanese Prime Minister Kan Naoto to put his words on 15 August, Korea's Liberation Day into action. Regular reunions of the families separated by the Korean War drew attention as an international issue after being included in the Chair's Statement.|$|E
40|$|This volume {{represents}} the first, in-depth, inter-disciplinary, {{analysis of the}} past, present and future of the European Union’s relations with countries, non-state actors and other partners across the Asia-Pacific region. The book is situated in the developing, interdisciplinary, discourse of EU foreign policy towards countries and regions across Asia, and it offers a research-led critique of the construction and {{the elements of the}} EU-Asia ‘political space’. Written by an international team of experts from both Asia and Europe, the volume investigates the historical and cultural background, as well as diverse representations and imaginations in regard to the Asia-Europe inter-continental dialogue. The book examines the varied patterns, policies and priorities of the contemporary political, economic and cultural relations linking the EU with its interlocutors in Asia. Moreover, this collection throws light on a selected number of issues pertinent to current EU-Asia interaction, such as human rights promotion, learning and educational exchange, {{and the role of the}} mass media in the construction of Asia-Europe relations. The twelve chapters in this book cover a wide scope of subjects, including the EU’s Relations with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the summitry of the <b>Asia-Europe</b> <b>Meetings</b> (ASEM), EU foreign policy choices in Asia and EU contacts with Central Asia, Australia and New Zealand. This text is of interest to undergraduate and postgraduate students, lecturers, the business community, decision-makers and practitioners in Politics, European Studies, Asia-Pacific Studies, International Relations, Law, Human Rights and Business Studies...|$|R

40|$|Table of Contents. Europe and the Emergence of China: Consequences for the Transatlantic Relationship, A European Perspective, Bruno Tertrais; The Lifting of the EU Arms Embargo on China, An American Perspective, Peter Brooks; The Rise of China and its Meaning for the Structure of Global Leadership in the 21 st Century: A Russian Perspective, by Alexei D. Voskressenski. There {{has been}} an {{official}} relationship between the EU and the People’s Republic of China for 30 years now. This relationship was upgraded in 1998. It now {{takes the form of}} a China-EU summit every year, the latest having taken place in December 2004. The EU became China’s main trading partner in 2004, with trade between the two parties soaring to € 160 billion. The EU’s strategy towards China, which is based on European Commission policy papers adopted in 1998, 2001 and 2003, aims at engaging China in the international community, supporting China’s transition towards an open society based upon the rule of law and the respect of human rights, and integrating China further in the world economy. (1) The theme of ‘multipolarity’ is also implicitly present in the European approach: “The EU, as a global player on the international stage, shares China’s concern for a more balanced international order based on effective multilateralism”. 2 The EU’s interest in Asia has been primarily economic and political, and is particularly incarnated in the series of <b>Asia-Europe</b> <b>Meetings</b> that have taken place since the mid- 1990 s. To be sure, Europeans do have some significant strategic interests in the region. Some EU members are bound by the 1953 agreement to defend South Korea, for instance. The EU has shown a keen interest in the North Korean problem, including being a party to the Korean Energy Development Organisation agreement and keeping contact with Pyongyang while Washington snubbed North Korea in the early days of the Bush administration. The strategic dimension is not completely left out of the Chinese-European relationship – there are regular meetings of experts on non-proliferation as well as conventional arms exports and a joint declaration on non-proliferation and arms control was signed at the latest summit. Nevertheless, Europe’s thinking about strategic issues in Northeast Asia remains very limited. And Asia remains to a large extent the missing dimension of transatlantic dialogue and cooperation. This helps to explain why the political sensitivity of issues such as China’s participation in the Galileo system (€ 200 million) and the ramifications of the question on the arms embargo were not always clearly seen in Europe until recently...|$|R
25|$|As one of {{the five}} {{founding}} members of ASEAN, it is a strong supporter of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the ASEAN Investment Area, because Singapore's economy is closely linked to that of the region as a whole. Former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong proposed the formation of an ASEAN Economic Community, a step beyond the current AFTA, bringing it closer to a common market. This was agreed to in 2007 for implementation by 2015. Other regional organisations are important to Singapore, and it is the host of the APEC Secretariat. Singapore maintains membership in other regional organisations, such as <b>Asia–Europe</b> <b>Meeting,</b> the Forum for East Asia-Latin American Cooperation, the Indian Ocean Rim Association, and the East Asia Summit. It {{is also a member of}} the Non-Aligned Movement and the Commonwealth.

40|$|This article {{examines}} continuity {{and change in}} the European Union’s interactions with the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) with regard to Myanmar. As the EU has used its connections with ASEAN to raise its concerns around Myanmar, the Association’s behaviour also comes into focus. This investigation {{is linked to the}} evolution of the EU in world affairs via its political ties to ASEAN.

The EU’s concern that the Myanmar issue not destabilise its relations with ASEAN has remained constant, however changes in the dialogue can be seen as forming three distinct phases. It is maintained that the aspiration to escape from pervasive China and the desirability of attracting new partners were the catalyst for these changes.
