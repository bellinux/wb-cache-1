For example, yet another order, ne iris mi, would suggest that the possibility of not having gone was under discussion, and mi is given as an example of one who did not go.|$|E
500|$|After {{one last}} {{interview}} with Feletti—who again said almost nothing, citing a sacred oath—Carboni {{informed him that}} so {{far as he could}} see, there was no evidence to support his version of events. Feletti replied: [...] "I commiserate with the Mortara parents for their painful separation from their son, but I hope that the prayers of the innocent soul succeed in having God reunite them all in the Christian religion... <b>As</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> punishment, not only do I place myself in the Lord's hands, but I would argue that any government would recognise the legitimacy of my action." [...] The next day Feletti and De Dominicis, the latter of whom had fled to the rump Papal States, were formally charged with the [...] "violent separation of the boy Edgardo Mortara from his own Jewish family".|$|E

[...] All I do is sing [...] "Hate to Get Up in the Morning" [...] as I did in the show, but the camera is a severe judge and I am afraid even with the great amount of care and fuss they can't improve what the Fates decreed to be a homely face. [...] <b>As</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> voice, I made a recording. [...] When the record was first played on the set, one of the electricians, who didn't know whose voice it was, said, [...] "If the guy who wrote that song could hear the record, he would turn over in his grave"--which gives you a fair idea. [...] However I am hoping it won't be too bad.|$|E

2500|$|When queried by the French weekly, Point de Vue, {{as to why}} {{he claimed}} headship of the Imperial dynasty in view of his republican pretensions, Charles replied, [...] "I assume the 'moral heritage' of my name. To renounce today to my ability to become the head of our House would imply that I accept a certain number of grievances of which I have been accused...I cannot accept this {{sentence}} from another era. <b>As</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> republican sentiments, those who reproach me misunderstand the history of our family.

2500|$|During a 1971 {{conference at}} Columbia University, a {{creative}} writing student asked Borges what he regarded as [...] "a writer's duty to his time". Borges replied, [...] "I think a writer's {{duty is to}} be a writer, and if he can be a good writer, he is doing his duty. Besides, I think of my own opinions as being superficial. For example, I am a Conservative, I hate the Communists, I hate the Nazis, I hate the anti-Semites, and so on; but I don't allow these opinions to find their way into my writings—except, of course, when I was greatly elated about the Six Days' War. Generally speaking, I think of keeping them in watertight compartments. Everybody knows my opinions, but <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> dreams and my stories, they should be allowed their full freedom, I think. I don't want to intrude into them, I'm writing fiction, not fables." ...|$|E

The etiquette demanded that as Queen Dowager, she should not greet her daughter-in-law at the stair of the royal palace {{with the rest of}} the royal family, but wait for her in her own salon, but she refused: [...] "I know myself how I suffered, when I arrived to Sweden, and how painfully I reacted to the cold reception I was given by Queen Louisa Ulrika. <b>As</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> daughter-in-law, I have decided to spare her from having to experience such bitter emotions!"
