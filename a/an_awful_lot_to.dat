500|$|James Delingpole of The Spectator {{noted that}} {{subsequent}} to Fourth Doctor Tom Baker's departure and prior to Eccleston actors who portrayed the Doctor {{had a tendency}} to play the role [...] "too camp, knowing, lovable or twee". He felt that the [...] "brusque, sarky and virile" [...] Ninth Doctor [...] "transports us back to the golden era of Jon Pertwee when the series still had that edge of darkness." [...] Marena Manzoufas, head of ABC programming, commented after picking up the series that Eccleston [...] "has brought a new dynamic energy to the role" [...] and the show would appeal to both long time viewers and new fans. She cited the high viewing figures of Eccleston's debut episode—over 10 million—as proof that audiences were ready to welcome in a new era of the show. Looking back on David Tennant's era and forward to Matt Smith, The Heralds Edd McCracken comments that casting Tennant had been a risk after [...] "the show's reputation and ratings" [...] had been [...] "restored under Eccleston". However he notes that due to the brevity of the Ninth Doctor's era Tennant subsequently had time to make his character more established. Richard Henley Davis of The Economic Voice also notes that Tennant [...] "had big boots to fill after Christopher Eccleston's Doctor Who, which many believe to be the greatest incarnation of the lunatic time lord." [...] In a 2005 interview Tennant himself stated [...] "there's <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> live up to" [...] after taking on the role from Eccleston, having admired his performances as a viewer.|$|E

Even though the cutting wit of the first decade lost its edge a bit, I still find 'The Simpsons' an extremely enjoyable way to spend my time. There aren't many things that are better than sitting down with a new season of 'The Simpsons' on Blu-ray and watching every episode back to back as fast as I possibly can. While the episodes sort of blend together, the humor is still there, and I still end up having quite a few genuine laughs". CraveOnline rated the season 8.5/10, noting [...] "Some [...] "Simpsons" [...] fans gave up during a perceived rough patch around season 12, and boy have they missed out. Season 13 was a particular favorite of mine, but now we're over the hump on the DVD releases.

As always, this season of The Simpsons features a stellar line-up of guest stars. And, as always, there are some standout episodes. All in all, a more than decent season of this long, long-running show." [...] DIY wrote [...] "While Season 15 of The Simpsons may not be golden from start to finish it has a higher great to soggy episode ratio than more recent seasons. In fact, there are some real gems amongst the 22 episodes". Boxofficebuz gave it 4 stars, and said [...] "...Throw in flashback episode 'The Way We ,' Pie-Man antics in 'Simple Simpson' and a Catch Me If You Can spoof in 'Catch 'Em If You Can,' you have a solid, solid season. A definite uptick over the previous couple seasons". BubbleBlabber rated it 9.0 out of 10, and concluded [...] "In terms of the content, Season 15 was a highly underrated season for The Simpsons and brought along a number of now well-known classics". DVDMg gave the season a B, and wrote [...] "Should viewers expect greatness from Season 15 of The Simpsons? No, as the year comes with some mediocre shows.

Which means, sadly, that anybody buying The Slade Box as any kind of substitute for the earlier albums is in for something of a disappointment. No complaints with the track listing, though. Across 84 tracks, Slade's entire catalog has been cherry-picked for precisely the right songs to illustrate a career of their depth and dynamism. But when the strict chronology means you hit [...] "Merry Xmas Everybody" [...] at the end of disc one; and [...] "In for a Penny" [...] by midway through disc two, that means there's <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> <b>lot</b> more <b>to</b> listen through before the four discs are at an end. And it really is too much, {{no matter how much you}} love the band. Of course, a democratic trawl through the band's entire catalog is no less than Slade deserve, and history will thank Union Square for finally giving the later years a fair crack of the whip. The booklet is wonderful, the packaging attractive and the sound quality is superlative." ...|$|R
