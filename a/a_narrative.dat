40|$|This article {{critically}} {{examines the}} difficulty with creating <b>a</b> shared <b>narrative</b> in post-conflict Northern Ireland. Using {{the legacy of}} policing {{as a case study}} for drawing more general conclusions about creating <b>a</b> shared <b>narrative,</b> the article interrogates how disagreement over where to start and end the discussion and exclusivist approaches to victimhood are obstructing attainment of <b>a</b> shared <b>narrative.</b> The article analyses competing policing narratives as constructed from the lived reality of opposing ethno-nationalist collectives with different experiences in a heated ‘memory politics’ domain. Concluding with the argument that the prerequisite to successfully building <b>a</b> shared <b>narrative</b> is departure from competing ‘memory politics’ understandings of the past, the article suggests a new understanding of victimhood and perpetratorship in Northern Ireland. ...|$|R

However, Liszt's view of the symphonic poem tended to be evocative, using music to create a general mood or atmosphere rather than to illustrate <b>a</b> <b>narrative</b> or describe something literally. In this regard, Liszt authority Humphrey Searle suggests {{that he may have}} been closer to his contemporary Hector Berlioz than to many who would follow him in writing symphonic poems.|$|E

5|$|Flower was {{intended}} as a spiritual successor to Flow. Using the PlayStation 3's motion sensitive controller, the player controls wind that blows a flower petal through the air. Flying close to flowers results in the player's petal being followed by other flower petals. Approaching flowers may also have side-effects on the game world, such as bringing vibrant color to previously dead fields or activating stationary windmills. The game features no text or dialogue, forming <b>a</b> <b>narrative</b> arc primarily through visual representation and emotional cues. It was released for the PlayStation 3 on February 12, 2009.|$|E

Transformations in values, expectations and life priorities {{are likely to be}} experienced and in order to regain a coherent sense of self, people must interpret their experiences. People with difficult to diagnose illnesses can find themselves living with greater uncertainty and stigma. This paper explores how people with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) describe and interpret their illness experience by applying Arthur Frank's narrative typologies to analyse interviews with 17 British people with CFS/ME. The analysis proposes that <b>a</b> trajectory of <b>narrative</b> typologies is experienced, starting with <b>a</b> restitution <b>narrative,</b> moving to <b>a</b> chaos <b>narrative</b> and, for most, back to <b>a</b> restitution <b>narrative</b> and on to <b>a</b> quest <b>narrative.</b> The presentation of narrative types put forward by people living with CFS/ME differ to those presented by people who are HIV positive and have been treated for breast cancer.
