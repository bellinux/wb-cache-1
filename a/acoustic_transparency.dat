25|$|Stating the {{efficiency}} of wind noise reduction is an inexact science, since the effect varies enormously with frequency, and hence with the bandwidth of the microphone and audio channel. At very low frequencies (10–100Hz) where massive wind energy exists, reductions are important to avoid overloading of the audio chain – particularly the early stages. This can produce the typical “wumping” sound associated with wind, which is often syllabic muting of the audio due to LF peak limiting. At higher frequencies – 200Hz to ~3kHz – the aural sensitivity curve allows us to hear the effect of wind as an addition to the normal noise floor, {{even though it has}} a far lower energy content. Simple shields may allow the wind noise to be 10dB less apparent; better ones can achieve nearer to a 50dB reduction. However the <b>acoustic</b> <b>transparency,</b> particularly at HF, should also be indicated, since a very high level of wind attenuation could be associated with very muffled audio.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} both experimentally and theoretically how {{to generate}} the acoustical analogue of the Electromagnetically Induced Transparency. This phenomenon arises from Fano resonances originating from constructive and destructive interferences of a narrow discrete resonance with a broad spectral line or continuum. Measurements were realized on a double-cavity structure by using a Kundt’s Tube. Transmission properties reveal an asymmetric lineshape of the transmission that leads to <b>acoustic</b> <b>transparency...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{propagation}} of the transverse-longitudinal acoustic pulses through a strained cubic crystal containing the resonant paramagnetic impurities with effective spin S= 1 is investigated. It is supposed that the pulses propagate under arbitrary angle {{with respect to}} the direction of the external static deformation parallel to the fourth-order symmetry axis. In this geometry, both the transverse and longitudinal components of the acoustic field have the high-frequency and zero-frequency spectral components. We show that a pulse can propagate in the modes different from the <b>acoustic</b> self-induced <b>transparency.</b> In particular, a pulse propagating in the mode of acoustic self-induced supertransparency substantially changes the populations of the spin sublevels, but its group velocity remains almost equal to the linear velocity of the sound. If a pulse propagates in the <b>acoustic</b> extraordinary <b>transparency</b> mode, then its group velocity is substantially lower while the sublevel populations remain virtually invariant. Also, the modes of propagation under conditions of weakly excited spin transitions and large detuning of the pulse high-frequency components are identified.

40|$|Transmission of {{acoustic}} waves {{through a}} periodic array of sub-wavelength slits or holes {{have been studied}} in several recent works in relation with physical phenomena such as resonant (extraordinary) transmission, broadband sound shielding or <b>acoustic</b> induced <b>transparency</b> (AIT). In this work, we present {{for the first time}} the study of analogous phenomena for Lamb waves propagating in a thin plate. We study the transmission through one or two rows of a periodic array constituted by thin bridges separated by rectangular holes. When two rows of such an array are considered, the choice of the distance between both rows allows the realization of a broadband attenuation up to 99 % in the transmission. These investigations should have implications for sound isolation, filtering and sensing applications...|$|R

The nonlinear Love wave propagating along {{the interface between}} of a plane surface layer and the elastic semi-space under the condition of <b>acoustic</b> self-induced <b>transparency</b> is investigated. A thin resonance transition layer containing paramagnetic impurity atoms or semiconductor quantum dots sandwiched between these two connected media. Explicit analytical expressions for the profile and parameters of the Love vector soliton are obtained.

These seals also contribute in the acoustic performance of the system specifically in the 3 kHz frequency band known as the coincidence frequency. In this paper, we present the simulation of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>transparency</b> of a car window with seals around. In a first stage, the mounting of the seals around the windows is simulated by mean of a 2 D non linear static analysis {{in order to get}} the deformed and pre-stressed state of the seal. In a second stage, a 3 D mesh of the vibro-acoustic model is built. It is composed of the 600 x 600 x 4 mm glass surrounded by the seals. All components are meshed with volumic elements. A thickness of 10 cm air behind the glass is also meshed {{in order to get the}} radiated acoustic power at this distance allowing experimental-simulation comparisons. Infinite acoustic elements are finally added to simulate an infinite space. The window is excited by a diffused field. The <b>acoustic</b> <b>transparency</b> curves are presented up to 5200 Hz. Comparisons with tests show a good correlation and give confidence in the vibro-acoustic model for predictive purposes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper investigates, {{by means}} of a {{numerical}} model, the possibility of using an active noise barrier to virtually reduce the <b>acoustic</b> <b>transparency</b> of a partition wall inside an enclosure. The room is modeled with the image method as a rectangular enclosure with a stationary point source; the active barrier is set up by an array of loudspeakers and error microphones and is meant to minimize the squared sound pressure on a wall {{with the use of a}} decentralized control. Simulations investigate the effects of the enclosure characteristics and of the barrier geometric parameters on the sound pressure attenuation on the controlled partition, on the whole enclosure potential energy and on the diagonal control stability. Performances are analyzed in a frequency range of 25 – 300 Hz at discrete 25 Hz steps. Influencing parameters and their effects on the system performances are identified with a statistical inference procedure. Simulation results have shown that it is possible to averagely reduce the sound pressure on the controlled partition. In the investigated configuration, the surface attenuation and the diagonal control stability are mainly driven by the distance between the loudspeakers and the error microphones and by the loudspeakers directivity; minor effects are due to the distance between the error microphones and the wall, by the wall reflectivity and by the active barrier grid meshing. Room dimensions and source position have negligible effects. Experimental results point out the validity of the model and the efficiency of the barrier in the reduction of the wall <b>acoustic</b> <b>transparency...</b>|$|E
40|$|Using a Multiple Scattering Theory algorithm, we {{investigate}} numerically {{the transmission of}} ultrasonic waves through a disordered locally resonant metamaterial containing only monopolar resonators. By comparing the cases of a perfectly random medium with its pair correlated counterpart, we show that the introduction of short range correlation can substantially impact the effective parameters of the sample. We report, notably, the opening of an <b>acoustic</b> <b>transparency</b> window {{in the region of}} the hybridization band gap. Interestingly, the transparency window is found to be associated with negative values of both effective compressibility and density. Despite this feature being unexpected for a disordered medium of monopolar resonators, we show that it can be fully described analytically and that it gives rise to negative refraction of waves...|$|E
40|$|Investigating {{dispersion}} {{surface morphology}} of sonic metamaterials {{is crucial in}} providing information on related phenomena as inertial coupling, <b>acoustic</b> <b>transparency,</b> polarisation, and absorption. In the present study, we look into frequency surface morphology of two-dimensional (2 D) metamaterials of K 3, 3 and K 6 topologies. The elastic structures under consideration consist of the same substratum lattice points and form a pair of sublattices with hexagonal symmetry. We show that, through introducing universal localised mass-in-mass phononic microstructures at lattice points, six single optical frequency-surfaces can be formed with required properties including negative group velocity. Splitting the frequency-surfaces {{is based on the}} classical analog of the quantum phenomenon of ‘energy-level repulsion’, which can be achieved only through internal anisotropy of the nodes and allows us to obtain different frequency band gaps...|$|E

The article presents a designed model of elastic interaction of penetrating acoustic radiation with flat isotropic suspension elements of an inertial navigation sensor in the operational conditions of hypersonic flight. It {{has been shown that}} the <b>acoustic</b> <b>transparency</b> effect {{in the form of a}} spatial-frequency resonance becomes possible with simultaneous manifestation of the wave coincidence condition in the acoustic field and equality of the natural oscillation frequency of a finite-size plate and a forced oscillation frequency of an infinite plate. The effect can lead to additional measurement errors of the navigation system. Using the model, the worst and best case suspension oscillation frequencies can be determined, which will help during the design of a navigation system...|$|E
40|$|The {{integrated}} extinction (IE) {{is defined}} as the integral of the scattering cross-section as a function of wavelength. Sohl et al. [1] derived an IE expression for acoustic scattering that is causal, i. e. the scattered wavefront in the forward direction arrives later than the incident plane wave in the background medium. The IE formula was based on electromagnetic results, for which scattering is causal by default. Here we derive a formula for the acoustic IE that is valid for causal and non-causal scattering. The general result is expressed as an integral of the time dependent forward scattering function. The IE reduces to a finite integral for scatterers with zero long-wavelength monopole and dipole amplitudes. Implications for acoustic cloaking are discussed and a new metric is proposed for broadband <b>acoustic</b> <b>transparency.</b> Comment: 11 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} studied the {{dynamics}} of the cavitation zone development. Cavitation zone was generated by high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in pulsed mode. Three stages of the process were identified. Sonoluminescence (SL) is absent at the first stage. The output signal of the hydrophone which is placed above {{the focal point of the}} transducer, is constant if the voltage applied to the transducer is constant. It is increased linearly if the ultrasound intensity is increased linearly. The sonoluminescence is appeared at the second stage. Its intensity is increased slowly at this stage. At the third stage a jump-like increase of SL is observed. The <b>acoustic</b> <b>transparency</b> of the cavitation zone is decreased simultaneously. Cavitation noise spectra are changed significantly with stages of that cavitation zone development. This is indicative that the different regimes of sonication could be identified by spectral analysis of cavitation noise...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} nineties, active sonar {{performance}} modelling {{has been developed}} at TNO in the ALMOST model, computing propagation and sonar processing for point targets of given Target Strength. Recently, the model was expanded for modelling of extensive targets, represented by reflecting pixels, with local normal vectors. A generic surface ship is modelled, including wall thickness, to examine echo structures (Target Strength) where aspect angle dependence is paramount. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>transparency</b> of ship walls towards lower frequencies is accounted for. The pixel file is also applied in the magnetic field model MAGFIELD, recently developed at TNO, with observations in a plane below the ship. Wall thickness is taken into account for evaluating the disturbance in the earth magnetic field, computing the resultant magnetic induction from {{a large number of}} magnetic dipoles, one per pixel. The model treats magnetisation of hull shaped structures in a computationally effective way, using local radii of curvature.

40|$|Cassini {{is a large}} robotic {{spacecraft}} {{currently under}} development at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) whose interplanetary scientific mission is to explore Saturn, its ring, and its moons. Cassini is scheduled to launch on a Titan IV rocket with a Centaur upper stage booster, and will be protected during ascent through the atmosphere by a lightweight aluminum payload fairing (PLF). As {{a result of the}} extreme noise levels generated by the powerful Titan IV at liftoff, and the <b>acoustic</b> <b>transparency</b> of the PLF, Cassini is predicted to experience sever acoustic levels. Furthermore, the high acoustic levels, coupled with the size and configuration of the spacecraft, will induce unacceptable random vibration levels on the structure and critical spacecraft components. Studies showed that the use of Tuned Vibration Absorbers (TVAs) would be effective in reducing vibration.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} new {{proof of the}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>transparency</b> theorem for {{material}} with a bounded variation. The theorem states that if the material properties (density, bulk modulus) is of bounded variation, the net power transmitted through the point z = 0 over a time interval [−T,T] is greater than some constant times the energy at the time zero over a spatial interval [0,Z], provided that T equals the time of travel of a wave from 0 to Z. This means the reflected energy of an input into the earth will be received. Otherwise, the reflections may not arrive at the surface. A proof gives a lower bound for material properties (density, bulk modulus) with bounded variation using sideways energy estimate. A different lower bound that works only for piecewise constant coefficients is also given. It gives a lower bound by analyzing reflections and transmissions of the waves at the jumps of the material properties. This thesis also gives an example to illustrate that the bounded variation assumption may not be necessary for the medium to be transparent. This thesis also discusses relations between the transparency property and the data of an inverse problem...|$|E
40|$|The {{widespread}} use of MRI has created a demand for high quality images for current and emerging applications. High quality images are currently acquired by using application specific receive coils that fit close to the patient’s body to produce high signal to noise ratio. These coils are manufactured using traditional printed circuit board fabrication technologies that produce large heavy coils that do not suit some applications very well. In particular, two areas {{that have not been}} able to take advantage of the current receive coils are pediatric imaging and MR guided high intensity focused ultrasound therapy due to size, weight, and thickness constraints. These two areas would benefit greatly from the high quality imaging provided by purpose-built lightweight and thin receive coil arrays. One way to achieve a very lightweight and thin coil is to fabricate it from solution using printed electronics. Here for the first time, advances in solution-processed fabrication techniques have allowed lightweight, thin, and flexible receive coil arrays to be made for these applications. In this thesis the development of printed MRI receive coils is discussed, covering fabrication, characterization, and implementation. An entirely printed approach is used to create single element receive coils that are characterized and tested on 1. 5 T and 3 T clinical systems. The materials used to fabricate the coil components are identified as a main avenue for improvement. A fully printed proof-of-concept array is made to demonstrate feasibility and is used to image a volunteer on a 3 T clinical system. Coils are optimized with components made from high quality flexible substrates to make better performing printed coils and arrays. These printed arrays are compared to commercially available arrays on several phantoms as well as on a volunteer on a 3 T scanner. In addition to creating coils for standard clinical imaging, several coils and arrays are optimized for use in an high intensity focused ultrasound interventional MRI. Coil materials are evaluated for <b>acoustic</b> <b>transparency,</b> stability in water, safety, and electrical quality. The optimized coils are used to evaluate image quality as well as to characterize the system level of <b>acoustic</b> <b>transparency.</b> An 8 -channel coil array is used to characterize image quality on a volunteer. To show a system level proof-of-concept on an interventional MR system, optimized arrays are used to track ultrasonic heating inside phantoms and ex-vivo tissue. Overall, the characteristics of the printed coils described in this thesis enable a new generation of coils design for both traditional and emerging applications...|$|E
40|$|In the Ionian Sea, one of {{the most}} seismically active regions in the Mediterranean, {{subduction}} is commonly associated with uplift of coastal mountains, enhanced erosion, and seismic activity along the Calabrian Arc and Hellenic Arc, thus potentially resulting in repetitive mass failures. Some of the turbidites observed in the deep basins are thick and prominent on seismic records because of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>transparency</b> of their upper structureless mud layer. Our high-resolution study of the most recent of these megabeds, the homogenite Augias turbidite (HAT), provides key proxies to identify pelagic sediments deposited following the catastrophic causative event. Radiometric dating in an area > 150, 000 km 2 indicates that the different Mediterranean so-called homogenite deposits are in fact synchronous and were deposited during a single basin-wide event within the time window A. D. 364 – 415. Unlike interpretations that relate this turbidite to different triggering events, including the Santorini caldera collapse, the turbidite {{can be traced back to}} a large tsunami sourced from the A. D. 365 Crete megathrust earthquake. Correlation of the single-event HAT over a wide area of the Mediterranean, from the northern Ionian Sea to the Mediterranean Ridge and the anoxic Tyro Basin south of Crete, suggests that the A. D. 365 Crete earthquake and tsunami must have produced devastating effects, including widespread massive sediment remobilization in the eastern Mediterranean Sea...|$|E
40|$|Glass {{reinforced}} plastic (GRP) {{is now an}} established material for the fabrication of sonar windows. Its good mechanical strength, light weight, resistance to corrosion and <b>acoustic</b> <b>transparency,</b> are all properties which fit it for this application. This thesis describes a study, undertaken at the Royal Naval Engineering College, Plymouth, into the mechanical behaviour of a circular cylindrical sonar panel. This particular type of panel {{would be used to}} cover a flank array sonar in a ship or submarine. The case considered is that of a panel with all of its edges mechanically clamped and subject to pressure loading on its convex surface. A comprehensive program of testing, to determine the orthotropic elastic properties of the laminated composite panel material is described, together with a series of pressure tests on 1 : 5 scale sonar panels. These pressure tests were carried out in a purpose designed test rig, using air pressure to provide simulated hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loading. Details of all instrumentation used in the experimental work are given in the thesis. The experimental results from the panel testing are compared with predictions of panel behaviour obtained from both the Galerkin solution of Flugge's cylindrical shell equations (orthotropic case), and finite element modelling of the panels using PAFEC. A variety of appropriate panel boundary conditions are considered in each case. A parametric study, intended to be of use as a preliminary design tool, and based on the above Galerkin solution, is also presented. This parametric study considers cases of boundary conditions, material properties, and panel geometry, outside of those investigated in the experimental work Final conclusions are drawn and recommendations made regarding possible improvements to the procedures for design, manufacture and fixing of sonar panels in the Royal Navy...|$|E
40|$|More than 10 000 km of {{high-resolution}} seismic profiles permit {{detailed study}} of six fourth-order seismic stratigraphic sequences deposited during the last million years on the Latium continental shelf, Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy. Sedimentation occurred on a relatively young passive margin characterized by a narrow and relatively steep shelf where sediment storage capacity in adjacent subaerial basins was limited. The Late Pleistocene deposits are locally tilted and eroded to different levels along the sea-floor so that carefully placed seafloor gravity cores help constrain {{the age of the}} seismic sequences by the dating of microfauna. Correlation with a deep well located on the coast constraints the basal third-order sequence boundary on the shelf. The seismic and a limited core database make it possible to: (1) detail variability in the architecture, stratal patterns and bounding surfaces of the sequences across the shelf and adjacent continental slope; (2) define a hierarchy of seismic units and their bounding surfaces; (3) make a correlation with the published oxygen-isotope curves; (4) develop a detailed stratigraphic framework and model for the fourth-order sequences deposited during last 0. 8 Ma; (5) define the effects of the long-lasting eustatic falls on margin sedimentation; (6) recognize volumetric partitioning of sedimentation between systems tracts. The seismo-stratigraphic expression of the third- and fourth-order sequence boundaries varies greatly from the inner to the outer part of the margin. Where subsidence allowed the preservation of lowstand systems tract (LST) deposits on the shelf, they are bounded by erosional unconformities interpreted to reflect fourth-order glacioeustatically-driven cycles. Relatively thin (< 10 m) lens-shaped bodies mark the transition from the unconformities to their correlative conformities and are interpreted to have been deposited during the eustatic minimum. The deposits bounded between correlative conformities show an upward loss in <b>acoustic</b> <b>transparency</b> thought to indicate upward-coarsening and regression within the sequences. Downdip on the continental slope, sequence boundaries are concordant surfaces correlative with unconformities on the shelf. However, these surfaces are locally scoured by channellized features, interpreted to record slope erosion related to the discharge of river bedload during lowstands. There is marked asymmetry and volumetric partitioning between systems tracts; most of the Late Quaternary deposits that comprise the Latium continental margin are interpreted to have formed during forced regression and lowstand. Offshore of the northern and central Latium shelves forced regressive and lowstand deposits account for some 1000 km 3 of shelf and slope deposition during the last eustatic cycle. In contrast, sediments attributed to the transgressive and highstand systems tracts account for approximately 37 km 3. High-frequency, high-amplitude asymmetric sea-level changes driven mainly by glacioeustasy are interpreted to have controlled deposition. Following classic three-fold sequence stratigraphic models, the unconformities created by shelf subaerial exposure and erosion represent sequence boundaries at the base of depositional sequences. However, if as is the case of the Latium margin during the Late Pleistocene, where a continental margin is formed almost exclusively of forced regressive deposits, each sequence basal boundary will paradoxically be situated above the forced regressive deposits that are deposited as the subaerial exposure surface forms, i. e. above the whole of its own depositional sequence. In this respect, the incorporation of a fourth forced regressive or falling stage systems tracts specific to times of base-level fall would help avoid this inconsistency...|$|E
