Raja is shown performing the single in various risqué outfits, such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> white sunglasses and a leopard print body suit. He also appears outside his drag persona.

5|$|In living organisms, DNA {{does not}} usually {{exist as a}} single molecule, but instead <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> {{molecules}} that are held tightly together. These two long strands entwine like vines, {{in the shape of}} a double helix. The nucleotide contains both a segment of the backbone of the molecule (which holds the chain together) and a nucleobase (which interacts with the other DNA strand in the helix). A nucleobase linked to a sugar is called a nucleoside and a base linked to a sugar and one or more phosphate groups is called a nucleotide. A polymer comprising multiple linked nucleotides (as in DNA) is called a polynucleotide.|$|E
5|$|The {{bills of}} bee-eaters are curved, long and {{end in a}} sharp point. The bill can bite strongly, {{particularly}} at the tip, and it is used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> forceps with which to snatch insects from the air and crush smaller prey. The short legs have weak feet, {{and when it is}} moving on the ground a bee-eater's gait is barely more than a shuffle. The feet have sharp claws used for perching on vertical surfaces and also for nest excavation.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we define}} the eta cochain form and prove its {{regularity}} when the kernel {{of a family}} of Dirac operators is a vector bundle. We decompose the eta form <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pairing</b> <b>of</b> the eta cochain form with the Chern character of an idempotent matrix and we also decompose the Chern character of the index bundle for a fibration with boundary <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pairing</b> <b>of</b> the family Chern-Connes character for a manifold with boundary with the Chern character of an idempotent matrix. We define the family $b$-Chern-Connes character and then we prove that it is entire and give its variation formula. By this variation formula, we prove another noncommutative family Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem. Thus, we extend the results of Gezler and Wu to the family case.

5|$|The {{film was}} {{directed}} by Robert Mulligan, and starred Gary Grimes as Hermie, Jerry Houser as his best friend Oscy, Oliver Conant as their nerdy young friend Benjie, Jennifer O'Neill as Hermie's mysterious love interest, and Katherine Allentuck and Christopher Norris <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> girls whom Hermie and Oscy attempt to seduce. Mulligan also has an uncredited role {{as the voice of}} the adult Hermie. Maureen Stapleton (Allentuck's real-life mother) also appears in a small, uncredited voice role (calling after Hermie as he leaves the house in an early scene, and after he enters his room in a later scene).|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} name Octopoda was first coined and given as {{the order of}} octopuses in 1818 by English biologist William Elford Leach, who classified them as Octopoida the previous year. The Octopoda consists of 300 known species and {{can be divided into}} two suborders, the Incirrina and the Cirrina. The incirrate octopuses (the majority of species) lack the cirri and paired swimming fins of the cirrates. In addition, the internal shell of incirrates is either present <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> stylets or absent altogether.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the second}} quarter, McCarron threw a 67-yard {{touchdown}} pass to DeAndrew White for a 17–14 lead. However, {{this would be the}} last time the Crimson Tide led in the game <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> turnovers by the Crimson Tide later in the quarter directly resulted in a pair of Oklahoma touchdowns. After the Sooners tied the game with a 47-yard Michael Hunnicutt field goal, Geneo Grissom recovered a Yeldon fumble at their eight-yard line and returned it to the 34. Seven plays later Knight threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Saunders for a 24–17 Oklahoma lead. On the next offensive series, McCarron threw his second interception of the game to Zack Sanchez who returned it to the Alabama 13-yard line. On the next play, Sterling Shepard extended the Sooners' lead to 31–17 with his 13-yard touchdown run. The Crimson Tide was able to get into field goal range late, but Foster missed an attempt from 32-yards as time expired for the first half.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth Bear's Carnival (2006) revisits the trope of the single-gender world, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> {{gay male}} ambassador-spies attempt to {{infiltrate}} and subvert the predominately lesbian civilization of New Amazonia, whose matriarchal rulers {{have all but}} enslaved their men. In 2007, J.K. Rowling's statement that Albus Dumbledore, a character in her Harry Potter series, was gay caused some controversy. Sarah Hall's dystopian novel The Carhullan Army (2007), published in the US under the title Daughters of the North, matter of factly features lesbians as primary characters. The novel won the 2007 John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and James Tiptree, Jr. Award, and was shortlisted for the 2008 Arthur C. Clarke Award. It is perhaps telling {{of the evolution of}} public perception of same sex relationships that the relationships are unmentioned or only peripherally noted in reviews.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the pattern}} {{adopted by the}} earlier tube lines, each of the UERL's lines was {{constructed}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> circular tunnels using tunnelling shields with segmental cast iron tunnel linings bolted together and grouted into place as the shield advanced. Generally the tunnels followed surface roads and were constructed side by side, but where {{the width of the}} road above was insufficient, tunnels were placed one above the other. Stations on all three lines were provided with surface buildings designed by the UERL's architect Leslie Green in a standardised style modified for each site. These consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. The stations had flat roofs and were designed to accommodate upward extension for commercial development. Most stations were provided with between two and four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft. At platform level, the wall tiling featured the station name and an individual geometric pattern and colour scheme designed by Green.|$|E
5|$|MD32 {{begins at}} a partial {{cloverleaf}} interchange with I-97 and MD3 (Robert Crain Highway) in Millersville. MD32 starts <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> two-lane flyover ramps that split west from northbound I-97 and join southbound I-97; the MD32 ramps head northwest while I-97 curves {{to the northeast}} and settles into the wide median of {{the northern end of}} MD3. After passing through its interchange with MD3, MD32 heads northwest as the Patuxent Freeway, a four-lane freeway that passes {{to the north of the}} community of Gambrills. The state highway's first interchange is with Sappington Station Road, a spur from the westbound ramps of MD32 that is unsigned MD32AA. The eastbound ramps connect with county-maintained Burns Crossing Road. MD32 continues northwest along the northern edge of Odenton, where the freeway gradually curves to the southwest, has a diamond interchange with MD170 (Telegraph Road) and a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD175 (Annapolis Road), and crosses over the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and MARC's Penn Line between the interchanges.|$|E

25|$|Reviewers {{consistently}} hailed Haruna <b>as</b> <b>a</b> comic heroine {{and a key}} to the series' appeal, but Kawahara's {{handling of}} the other chararacters was also praised, particularly with Yoh and his sister Asami. They also praised Haruna's relationship with Yoh, which is presented <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pairing</b> <b>of</b> friends and equals. Some critics noted that the story's initial makeover theme was more deftly handled than a short summary led them to expect, though some still expressed reservations about it.|$|R
5|$|On December 7, 1959, the I-94/US12 freeway {{opened on}} the south side of Kalamazoo. When US12 was shifted to follow the new freeway, the former route through {{downtown}} Kalamazoo was redesignated Business US Highway12 (Bus. US12). The next year, it was renumbered BL I-94. In 1963, the US131 freeway {{opened on the}} west side of Kalamazoo. Along with the creation of Bus. US131 along a portion of the BL I-94 routing, BL I-94 was rerouted along the US131 freeway on the west end back to I-94. The section of Stadium Drive west of US131 and the 9th Street routing was removed from BL I-94. Kalamazoo and the newly built Michikal avenues were transferred to state jurisdiction in 1965. Since then, Kalamazoo and Michigan avenues have been used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> one-way streets downtown. Kalamazoo and Michikal were then signed as westbound BL I-94 from Stadium Drive to Michigan Avenue while Main Street and Michigan Avenue continued to serve eastbound traffic.|$|E
5|$|Saratoga was assigned, {{together}} with Lexington, {{to defend the}} west coast of Panama against a hypothetical invader during Fleet Problem XII in February 1931. While each carrier was able to inflict some damage on the invasion convoys, the enemy forces succeeded in making a landing. All three carriers then transferred to the Caribbean to conduct further maneuvers, including one in which Saratoga successfully defended the Caribbean side of the Panama Canal from a staged attack by Lexington. Rear Admiral Joseph M. Reeves baited a trap for Lexingtons captain, Ernest J. King, with a destroyer and scored a kill on Lexington on 22 March while the latter's aircraft were still searching for Saratoga. The 1932 movie Hell Divers was filmed aboard the ship and starred Wallace Beery and a young Clark Gable <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> competing aircraft gunners assigned to VF-1B.|$|E
5|$|A general {{principle}} concerning dental abscesses is ubi pus, ibi evacua ("{{where there is}} pus, drain it"), which applies to any case {{where there is a}} collection of pus in the tissues (such as a periodontal abscess, pericoronal abscess, or apical abscess). The pus within the abscess is under pressure, and the surrounding tissues are deformed and stretched to accommodate the swelling. This leads to a sensation of throbbing (often in time with the pulse) and constant pain. Pus may be evacuated via the tooth by drilling into the pulp chamber (an endodontic access cavity). Such a treatment is sometimes termed open drainage. Drainage can also be performed via the tooth socket, once the causative tooth is extracted. If neither of those measures succeeds, or they are impossible, incision and drainage may be required, in which a small incision is made in the soft tissues directly over the abscess at the most dependent point. A surgical instrument such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> tweezers is gently inserted into the incision and opened, while the abscess is massaged to encourage the pus to drain out. Usually, the reduction in pain when the pus drains is immediate and marked as the built up pressure is relieved. If the pus drains into the mouth, there is usually a bad or offensive taste.|$|E

25|$|When {{equipped}} with all transitive edges, these graphs in turn are just special categories, where elements are objects and {{each set of}} morphisms between two elements is at most singleton. Functions between orders become functors between categories. Interestingly, many ideas of order theory are just concepts of category theory in small. For example, an infimum is just a categorical product. More generally, one can capture infima and suprema under the abstract notion of a categorical limit (or colimit, respectively). Another place where categorical ideas occur {{is the concept of}} a (monotone) Galois connection, which is just the same <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> adjoint functors.|$|E
