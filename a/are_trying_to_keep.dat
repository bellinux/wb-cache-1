500|$|Warner Bros. spent $100million {{marketing}} the film. Although Inception {{was not part}} of an existing franchise, Sue Kroll, president of Warner's worldwide marketing, said the company believed it could gain awareness due to the strength of [...] "Christopher Nolan as a brand". Kroll declared that [...] "We don't have the brand equity that usually drives a big summer opening, but we have a great cast and a fresh idea from a filmmaker with a track record of making incredible movies. If you can't make those elements work, it's a sad day." [...] The studio also tried to maintain a campaign of secrecy—as reported by the Senior VP of Interactive Marketing, Michael Tritter, [...] "You have this movie which {{is going to have a}} pretty big built in fanbase... but you also have a movie that you <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> very secret. Chris [...] really likes people to see his movies in a theater and not see it all beforehand so everything that you do to market that—at least early on—is with an eye to feeding the interest to fans." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{garnered}} mainly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Sarah Bardeen of Rhapsody said the album established Queen as [...] "the voice for women", complimenting her [...] "self-assured delivery". She {{claimed that the}} tracks in which featured guest artists [...] "get {{the sense that the}} guys she's trading verses with <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> up with her and not the other way around," [...] noting that the platinum edition [...] "launched the monster hit [...] "Quiero Bailar". Rachel Devitt, also writing for Rhapsody, categorized the album as [...] "Urban Latin" [...] music. Michael Endelman of Entertainment Weekly called the album their number one pick for crossover success in the United States while complimenting the [...] "catchy hooks and sticky grooves" [...] found on the album. Kalefa Sanneh of The New York Times said [...] " [...] celebrates her hybrid genre by refusing to stay put", while claiming Queen to sometimes depart from [...] "reggaeton's sharp, steady shuffle to explore other rhythms". She later said that the album would make Queen a [...] "likely candidate for crossover success, if only she didn't sing in Spanish". An editor for the Chicago Tribune selected the album as one of three to [...] "add to your reggaetón collection" [...] other than Daddy Yankee's Barrio Fino (2004). The writer noted the included hits ("Quiero Bailar" [...] and [...] "Papi Te Quiero"), along with [...] " [...] handful of remixes–and a whole lot of attitude". The album was highly anticipated and acclaimed and widely regarded as a factor in reggaeton's mainstream exposure in 2004 along with her next studio album Real (2004), Daddy Yankee's Barrio Fino and Tego Calderon's El Enemy de los Guasíbiri (2004), after being certified Platinum in the Latin field signifying sales of over 100,000 by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Jonathan Widran of Allmusic described [...] "Quiero Bailar" [...] as a song that [...] "gets the party and people moving" [...] and as well as being one of Queen's hits. Kid Curry, of Rhythmic Top 40 WPOW (Power 96) cites Ivy Queen's release of [...] "Yo Quiero Bailar" [...] as [...] "the last reggaetón super-hit". [...] "Papi Te Quiero" [...] was selected as one of the hits from [...] "The Golden Era of Reggaetón" [...] which lasted from 2003 until 2007 by Jesus Trivino of Latina magazine. The album was nominated for [...] "Reggaeton Album of the Year" [...] at the 2005 Billboard Latin Music Awards where she was also nominated for [...] "Tropical Airplay Track of the Year, Female" [...] and [...] "Tropical Airplay Track of the Year, New Artist".|$|E
2500|$|West's rhetoric won him both {{support and}} {{condemnation}} from differing groups along the American political spectrum. Members {{of the conservative}} movement viewed him as a [...] "torch bearer" [...] and [...] "conservative icon," [...] with Sarah Palin and Ted Nugent both suggesting him for vice president, and Glenn Beck supporting him for president. In January 2013, U.S. Representatives Paul Broun (R-Georgia) and Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) both voted for West as Speaker of the House, {{even though he was}} no longer a member of Congress. [...] Some of his statements include calling President Barack Obama [...] "an abject failure", ordering both pro-Palestinian demonstrators and the views of [...] "chicken men" [...] Democrats to [...] "get the hell out" [...] of the United States, opining that drivers with Obama bumper stickers are [...] "a threat to the gene pool", and pronouncing that African American Democrats <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> African Americans [...] "on the plantation", while casting himself as the [...] "modern-day Harriet Tubman" [...] ferrying them to rescue. In a critical summation of West's style, the liberal magazine Mother Jones opined that [...] " [...] every sentence is a proxy war in the larger struggle between patriots and the 'people in this world that just have to have their butts kicked.'".|$|E

A good many hunting seasons will have to come and go before we can think of a war of independence as even a distant possibility, and in the meantime hunting and horse-breeding and country sports generally are the things most likely to keep Englishmen together on the land. That is why so many men who hate the German occupation <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> field sports alive, and in the right hands. However, I won't go on arguing.

6000|$|Mr. Baker {{left his}} {{insecure}} place, and crawled, with stoppages, along the poop. In {{the dark and}} on all fours he resembled some carnivorous animal prowling amongst corpses. At the break, propped to windward of a stanchion, he looked down on the main deck. It {{seemed to him that}} the ship had a tendency to stand up a little more. The wind had eased a little, he thought, but the sea ran as high as ever. The waves foamed viciously, and the lee side of the deck disappeared under a hissing whiteness as of boiling milk, while the rigging sang steadily with a deep vibrating note, and, at every upward swing of the ship, the wind rushed with a long-drawn clamour amongst the spars. Mr. Baker watched very still. A man near him began to make a blabbing noise with his lips, all at once and very loud, as though the cold had broken brutally through him. He went on:--"Ba--ba--ba--brrr--brr--ba--ba."--"Stop that!" [...] cried Mr. Baker, groping in the dark. [...] "Stop it!" [...] He went on shaking the leg he found under his hand.--"What is it, sir?" [...] called out Belfast, in the tone of a man awakened suddenly; [...] "we are looking after that 'ere Jimmy."--"Are you? Ough! Don't make that row then. Who's that near you?"--"It's me--the boatswain, sir," [...] growled the West-country man; [...] "we <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> life in that poor devil."--"Aye, aye!" [...] said Mr. Baker. [...] "Do it quietly, can't you?"--"He wants us to hold him up above the rail," [...] went on the boatswain, with irritation, [...] "says he can't breathe here under our jackets."--"If we lift 'im, we drop 'im overboard," [...] said another voice, [...] "we can't feel our hands with cold."--"I don't care. I am choking!" [...] exclaimed James Wait in a clear tone.--"Oh, no, my son," [...] said the boatswain, desperately, [...] "you don't go till we all go on this fine night."--"You will see yet many a worse," [...] said Mr. Baker, cheerfully.--"It's no child's play, sir!" [...] answered the boatswain. [...] "Some of us further aft, here, are in a pretty bad way."--"If the blamed sticks had been cut out of her she would be running along on her bottom now like any decent ship, an' giv' us all a chance," [...] said some one, with a sigh.--"The old man wouldn't have it... much he cares for us," [...] whispered another.--"Care for you!" [...] exclaimed Mr. Baker, angrily. [...] "Why should he care for you? Are you a lot of women passengers to be taken care of? We are here {{to take care of the}} ship--and some of you ain't up to that. Ough!... What have you done so very smart to be taken care of? Ough!... Some of you can't stand a bit of a breeze without crying over it."--"Come, sorr. We ain't so bad," [...] protested Belfast, in a voice shaken by shivers; [...] "we ain't... brr..."--"Again," [...] shouted the mate, grabbing at the shadowy form; [...] "again!... Why, you're in your shirt! What have you done?"--"I've put my oilskin and jacket over that half-dead nayggur--and he says he chokes," [...] said Belfast, complainingly.--"You wouldn't call me nigger if I wasn't half dead, you Irish beggar!" [...] boomed James Wait, vigorously.--"You... brrr... You wouldn't be white if you were ever so well... I will fight you... brrrr... in fine weather... brrr ... with one hand tied behind my back... brrrrrr..."--"I don't want your rags--I want air," [...] gasped out the other faintly, as if suddenly exhausted.|$|E
