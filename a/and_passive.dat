40|$|This paper investigates children’s {{acquisition}} of benefactives <b>and</b> <b>passives</b> in Japanese. It has {{been pointed out}} that Japanese complex constructions with mora-w (receive) are acquired later than their counterparts with age-ru (give) (Uyeno et al. 1978). Also, many researchers report that passives are more difficult for children than active counterparts (Borer and Wexler 1987, Fox and Grodzinsky 1998, among others). In this paper, we first argue that benefactives <b>and</b> <b>passives</b> in Japanese share the similar syntactic properties such as movement and case-marking pattern. In particular, both mora-w (receive) benefactives <b>and</b> <b>passives</b> are derived from their age-ru (give) and active counterparts by movement which forms A-chain. Moreover, ni-phrases (by-phrases in English) both benefactives <b>and</b> <b>passives</b> contain can be replaced by kara-phrases (from-phrases) expressing source theta-role. Based on the observation, we examine the results of experiment we conducted with three native Japanese children. The results lead us {{to claim that the}} reason why mora-w (receive) benefactives <b>and</b> <b>passives</b> are difficult for children lies in the Agent marking ni-phrase (by-phrases) rather than in movement, rejecting the previous researches on both benefactives <b>and</b> <b>passives.</b> 1...|$|R

5|$|Beagles are the {{dog breed}} {{most often used}} in animal testing, due to their size <b>and</b> <b>passive</b> nature.

Of the 8,018 dogs used in testing in the UK in 2004, 7,799 were beagles (97.3%). In the UK, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 gave special status to primates, equids, cats and dogs and in 2005 the Animal Procedures Committee (set up by the act) ruled that testing on mice was preferable, even though a greater number of individual animals were involved. In 2005 beagles were involved in less than 0.3% of the total experiments on animals in the UK, but of the 7670 experiments performed on dogs 7406 involved beagles (96.6%). Most dogs are bred specifically for this purpose, by companies such as Harlan. In the UK companies breeding animals for research must be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.|$|E

NASA officially announced the mission on June 27, and the flight plan was finalized in late July. The mission focused on engineering tests rather than on scientific experimentation. The mission finally launched on the morning of October 3, having been delayed two weeks because of problems with the Atlas booster. A series of minor booster problems during launch and a faulty temperature controller in Schirra's pressure suit were the only technical problems noted during the flight. The spacecraft orbited in both automated <b>and</b> <b>passive</b> flight modes for prolonged periods while the pilot monitored it and carried out some minor scientific experiments. After six orbits, the capsule landed in the Pacific Ocean half a mile from the recovery carrier, and was hoisted aboard for Schirra to disembark.|$|E
5|$|Risk parity is a {{conceptual}} approach to investing which attempts {{to provide a}} lower risk and lower fee alternative to the traditional portfolio allocation of 60% stocks and 40% bonds which carries 90% of its risk in the stock portion of the portfolio (see illustration). The risk parity approach attempts to equalize risk by allocating funds to {{a wider range of}} categories such as stocks, government bonds, credit-related securities and inflation hedges (including real assets, commodities, real estate and inflation-protected bonds), while maximizing gains through financial leveraging. According to Bob Prince, CIO at Bridgewater Associates, the defining parameters of a traditional risk parity portfolio are uncorrelated assets, low equity risk, <b>and</b> <b>passive</b> management.|$|E
5|$|Termites use {{sophisticated}} {{means to}} control the temperatures of their mounds. As discussed above, the shape and orientation of the mounds of the Australian compass termite stabilises their internal temperatures during the day. As the towers heat up, the solar chimney effect (stack effect) creates an updraft of air within the mound. Wind blowing across {{the tops of the}} towers enhances the circulation of air through the mounds, which also include side vents in their construction. The solar chimney effect has been in use for centuries in the Middle East and Near East for passive cooling, as well as in Europe by the Romans. It is only relatively recently, however, that climate responsive construction techniques have become incorporated into modern architecture. Especially in Africa, the stack effect has become a popular means to achieve natural ventilation <b>and</b> <b>passive</b> cooling in modern buildings.|$|E

5|$|This {{demand was}} {{far-reaching}} and required {{transformation of the}} empire into a federal state, placing Lithuania {{on a par with}} the Grand Duchy of Finland within the Russian constitutional system. Heated discussions continued on the means to achieve this transformation. Some argued for armed resistance, but were reminded that the previous uprisings in November 1831 and January 1863 had failed. Others suggested peaceful <b>and</b> <b>passive</b> resistance: refusing to pay taxes, boycotting products from monopolistic companies (mostly those selling alcoholic beverages), not allowing children to attend Russian schools, evading drafts into the Russian army, and organizing factory worker strikes. The delegates, who were mostly small farmers, also discussed land reform, demanding that all land would be confiscated from large landlords and distributed to those who actually cultivated it. However, no conclusions in that area were reached as there was a perception that any resolution on land reform would encourage the peasants to rise against their landlords as it was happening in other parts of the Russian Empire.|$|E

Experience points are lost with each death, although the character does not lose experience levels. Other playable characters raise experience levels quicker depending on the player character's own level. Upon each level up, a character is granted three statistic points, which can be distributed by the player to increase a character attribute: these include maximum health.

After the Seimas, rural areas were left on their own without central guidance. After the resolution was adopted by the Seimas, near midnight, Jonas Basanavičius read aloud his proposal to include an attachment condemning Polish ecclesiastical authorities for suppressing the use of the Lithuanian language in churches within the diocese of Vilnius. The church matters had not been discussed during the sessions, but the majority agreed to the proposal by a show of hands.

40|$|The passive {{construction}} is a late acquisition in child language. In this paper I evaluate {{the claim that}} difficulty with noncanonical semantics, rather than non-mature subject-object A-chains, underlie young children’s poor performance on the passive. In a series of truth-value judgment tasks, 4 - and 5 -year-old English-speaking children were tested on their comprehension of matrix <b>passives</b> <b>and</b> <b>passives</b> embedded under raising-to-object (RO: want, need) and object control (OC: ask, tell) verbs. RO passives (Olivia wanted/needed Scott to be kissed by Misha) entail object-subject-object A-chains, but allow semantic patients to surface as syntactic objects; OC passives (Olivia asked/told Scott to be kissed by Misha) <b>and</b> matrix <b>passives</b> (Scott was kissed by Misha) involve similar A-chains but do not result in this syntactic-semantic configuration. I found that although 4 -year-olds failed to comprehend matrix <b>passives</b> <b>and</b> <b>passives</b> embedded under OC verbs, they correctly interpreted passives under RO verbs. (5 -year-olds performed above chance in all tasks.) I propose a “semantic scaffolding” account of children’s comprehension of the passive that rests on the prototypicality of subjects being agents and objects being patients, arguing against the view that difficulty with passives results from an inability to form A-chains...|$|R
