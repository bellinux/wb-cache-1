The things I've been doing for work lately have been so much fun, because it's not like work to me anymore. I've been even more 'hands on' in my management and the business side of things, and I feel more in control than ever.|$|E
500|$|For a time, Anderson {{directed}} Fitzgerald {{toward the}} relative safety of Whitefish Bay; then at 4:39p.m., McSorley contacted the USCG station in Grand Marais, Michigan, to inquire whether the Whitefish Point light and navigation beacon were operational. The USCG replied that their monitoring equipment indicated that both instruments were inactive. McSorley then hailed any {{ships in the}} Whitefish Point area to report {{the state of the}} navigational aids, receiving an answer from Captain Cedric Woodard of Avafors between 5:00 and 5:30p.m. that the Whitefish Point light was on but not the radio beacon. Woodard testified to the Marine Board that he overheard McSorley say, [...] "Don't allow nobody on deck," [...] as well as something about a vent that Woodard could not understand. Some time later, McSorley told Woodard, [...] "I have a 'bad list,' I have lost both radars, and <b>am</b> <b>taking</b> heavy seas over the deck in one of the worst seas I have ever been in." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jordan kept a diary {{during his}} service in France. [...] On March 1, 1918, {{five days before}} he was killed, Jordan wrote in his diary: [...] "I do not {{want you to think}} for a moment that I <b>am</b> <b>taking</b> this thing entirely light-mindedly. [...] No, not at all, but my {{attitude}} is this: Do the best you can and know how and then keep on smiling." [...] On March 2, 1918, he made his last entry: [...] "This fighting [...] we are doing now is the real thing. [...] A man gets to be quite a fatalist in this game. [...] If somehow or other they get me -— all well and good. If not —- still better. But somehow I feel safe." ...|$|E

40|$|To {{assess the}} effects of oral {{contraceptives}} on anticoagulant treatment the prothrombin times of 12 patients were measured while they <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> both drugs simultaneously and while they <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> only anticoagulants. The mean prothrombin time ratio was significantly higher when patients <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> both drugs than when they <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> only anticoagulants and their doses of anticoagulant were significantly lower. During both periods most of the prothrombin values remained in the therapeutic range. These findings suggest that, contrary to the common belief that oral contraceptives diminish {{the effects of}} anticoagulants, contraceptives in fact potentiate {{the action of the}} anticoagulants...|$|R
2500|$|In 1946, Buckland {{was part}} of a murder-suicide at his home located at 2035 Pinehurst Avenue in the Hollywood Heights {{neighborhood}} of Los Angeles. [...] He shot and killed his 36-year-old son and then shot himself. [...] Buckland left a note that said, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>taking</b> Billy with me." [...] The Los Angeles Times reported on the tragedy as follows:"Hollywood's first art director, 80-year-old Wilfred Buckland Sr., yesterday killed his mentally ailing son, 36, and then fatally shot himself in a double tragedy inspired by his fear of impending death from old age and reluctance to leave the younger man alone in the world. [...] Termed the 'founder of Hollywood cinema art,' the elder Buckland fired a bullet into the back of his sleeping son's head, which brought instant death." ...|$|E

She spoke of her [...] "stricken home" [...] and her son's history of illness. Ultimately, she questioned the Court's entire approach: [...] "I feel now that you men could have done much good had you perhaps had a little less sense of justice and a little more of the spirit of Jesus in your hearts." [...] Wolff's father asked the Dean to recognize that helping his son to reform was more important than punishment: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>taking</b> the liberty of appealing to you, not in your official capacity, but as a man, to do what you can to assist him. You know all are subject to mistakes, and the blessing is in those who can aid and advise in correcting and saving rather than otherwise." ...|$|E

30|$|Most of the 97 {{patients}} {{without a}} stable drug combination <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> drugs but with less consistency. Only 26 patients took no drugs for ≥ 50 % days. Few of the 97 patients took any drug in a medication class for ≥ 90 % of days. Of the 97 patients, 84 (86.6 %) <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> a mood stabilizer. Although 47 of the 84 (56 %) <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> a mood stabilizer for ≥ 90 % of days, they <b>were</b> not <b>taking</b> the same drug throughout the sample period.

5000|$|The above {{two forms}} can be combined, to {{indicate}} a present or past view of a prior (or prior and current) event that occurred with stative or progressive aspect ("I have/had been feeling well," [...] "I have/had <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> classes"); here the construction is [...] "have/has/had" [...] + [...] "been" [...] + main verb + -"ing". There is a subtle difference in usage between the case where the viewpoint is from {{the present and the}} case where it is from a point in the past: have <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> classes implies that the action is not only of present relevance but is continuing to occur; in contrast, had <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> classes indicates present relevance, allows but does not require the action to still be occurring (I had <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> classes but <b>was</b> not still doing so; I had <b>been</b> <b>taking</b> classes and still was).|$|R
2500|$|Gandhi's {{advocacy}} for women's rights began with her help {{in establishing the}} Congress Party's Women's Section. In 1956, she wrote in a letter: [...] "It is because of this that I <b>am</b> <b>taking</b> a much more active part in politics. I {{have to do a}} great deal of touring in order to set up the Congress Party Women's Section, and am on numerous important committees." [...] Gandhi {{spent a great deal of}} time throughout the 1950s helping organize women. She wrote to Norman in 1959, irritable that women had organized around the communist cause but had not mobilized for the Indian cause: [...] "The women, whom I have been trying to organize for years, had always refused to come into politics. Now they are out in the field." [...] Once appointed president in 1959, she [...] "travelled relentlessly, visiting remote parts of the country that had never before received a VIP...she talked to women, asked about child health and welfare, inquired after the crafts of the region" [...] Gandhi's actions throughout her ascent to power clearly reflect a desire to mobilize women. Gandhi did not see the purpose of feminism. Gandhi saw her own success as a woman, and also noted that [...] "Given the opportunity to develop, capable Indian women have come to the top at once." ...|$|E
