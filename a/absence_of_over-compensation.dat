40|$|The quantum {{interest}} conjecture of Ford and Roman {{asserts that}} any negative-energy pulse must necessarily {{be followed by}} an over-compensating positive-energy one within a certain maximum time delay. Furthermore, the minimum amount <b>of</b> <b>over-compensation</b> increases with the separation between the pulses. In this paper, we first study {{the case of a}} negativeenergy square pulse followed by a positive-energy one for a minimally coupled, massless scalar field in two-dimensional Minkowski space. We obtain explicit expressions for the maximum time delay and the amount <b>of</b> <b>over-compensation</b> needed, using a previously developed eigenvalue approach. These results are then used to give a proof of the quantum interest conjecture for massless scalar fields in two dimensions, valid for general energy distribution...|$|R
