It has been stated that performance management based on data collection and the evaluation of key performance indicators (KPIs) may not be effective due to the different indicators and measurement systems {{in place for the}} various participants in a collaborative network (CN). Therefore, measuring the strategic and inter-organizational alignment based on key <b>alignment</b> <b>indicators</b> (KAIs) can be an excellent alternative to improve performance evaluation systems.

40|$|The {{field of}} Respiratory Therapy (RT) is {{expected}} to experience a workforce shortfall over the next decade. The numbers of both program applicants and graduates have declined in recent years, necessitating strategies to improve board exam pass rates for future graduates. In response to the pending employment crisis, the Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care has published Programmatic Outcomes Data detailing individual program statistics. A theoretical framework adapted from Pierre Bourdieu 2 ̆ 7 s Concepts of Field and Capital was proposed to explain a possible re-stratification of RT programs. It states, in part, that a modification of position-takings within the RT educational field may be a consequence of this publication and the resources (capital) of students, clinical sites, faculty, and financial advantage will accompany the newly established positions. A descriptive study utilizing e-mail survey methodology was developed to gather baseline data from RT program directors {{in the areas of}} program characteristics, selected demographics, and average board exams scores in 17 curricular content areas. A convenience sample of programs was solicited from the top and bottom thirds of all programs with published programmatic outcomes. Comparison of results between the top and bottom thirds of the sample population was anticipated to discern which types of programs were more successful than others, what resources impacted credentialing success, and which curricular <b>alignment</b> <b>indicators</b> demonstrated the greatest disparities. Results seemed to indicate that optimal credentialing outcomes are frequently associated with public, not-for-profit programs; resources of entry-limitation, faculty numbers and degrees, utilized pedagogy, low teacher-to-student ratios, laboratory, clinical, and simulation practice hours, and hiring practices were not restricted to either sector of the population; and assessment of curriculum <b>alignment</b> <b>indicators</b> derived from board exam scores may be a vehicle for early recognition of program weaknesses. Results further indicated the need for follow-up studies to evaluate the long-term impact of the programmatic outcomes and how {{the results of this study}} may be utilized to focus program curricular remediation for improved outcomes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a simple political agency model {{to explain the}} effect of political alignment between different tiers of government on intergovernmental grants and election outcomes. Key features of the model are (i) rational voters interpret public good provision as a signal of incumbent competence, and (ii) realistically, grants are unobservable to voters. In this setting, the national government will use the grant as an instrument to manipulate the public good signal {{for the benefit of}} aligned local incumbents. Then, aligned municipalities receive more grants, with this effect being stronger before elections, and the probability that the aligned local incumbent is re-elected is higher. These predictions are tested using a regression discontinuity design on a new data-set on Italian municipalities. At a second empirical stage, the national grant to municipalities is instrumented with an <b>alignment</b> <b>indicator,</b> allowing estimation of a flypaper effect for Italian municipalities...|$|E
40|$|The {{divergence}} and <b>alignment</b> <b>indicator</b> (DAI) is {{an extension}} of the ASTM E 803 L/D thermal neutron radiography L/D device that allows the user to determine both the beam centerline and the beam divergence. The DAI was made using aluminium plate and rods, and incorporated cadmium wire for contrast. Circular symmetry was utilized to simplify manufacture. The DAI was placed with the five posts against the film cassette or radioscopic imaging device in the physical center of the beam, The DAI was perpendicular to the selected beam radius when the front and back center Cd wire images overlap. The degree of misalignment was indicated by their image positions. After the DA 1 was aligned, analysis of the cadmium wire &quot;+ &quot; image spacing yielded the beam divergence. The DAI was tested in a neutron beam which has an L/D of 30 but a small degree of divergence. The DAI was also imaged using an X-ray source. The point source predictions of Cd wire image locations showed good agreement with those measured from the X-ray radiograph. The neutron radiographic locations could be predicted using the point source equations, even though the neutron beam was a complex distributed source...|$|E

Drivers make fewer errors {{in the vicinity of}} geometric features that conform with their expectations. Techniques to evaluate the consistency of a design documented within this report include alignment indices, speed distribution measures, and driver workload. Alignment indices are quantitative measures of the general character of a roadway segment’s <b>alignment.</b> Potential <b>indicators</b> of geometric inconsistency include a large increase in the magnitude of the alignment indices for a successive roadway segment or feature or a high rate of change occuring over some length of road. Speed distribution measures—including variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and coefficient of skewness—were investigated as potential candidates for a consistency rating method. The results indicated that speed variance is inappropriate as a design consistency measure for horizontal curvature.

40|$|Abstract—Bug Triaging is a {{vital part}} of issue {{management}} systems. Bug triaging deals with assigning a developer the task of an incoming bug. This activity is error prone and time consuming if done manually. There is a need for automated support to accelerate this process. The current automated bug triaging systems exploits the text contents of the bug and the tossing relations among the developers. The automated bug triaging systems estimate the optimal bath between the first assignee of the bug and the bug resolver using the tossing relations. The metrics used for assessing the efficiency of bug triaging systems that are based on tossing relations is Mean number of Steps To Resolve (MSTR). This metric quantifies the number of steps reduced by the predicted path compared to the original path. It does not capture how far the retrieved path is in alignment with the actual path. MSTR does reveal the information regarding {{the extent to which the}} order of the developers in the retrieved path is in line with that of the original path. In addition, there are no indicators for measuring the strength of the retrieved path. In this paper, we propose two metrics (i) Path Similarity Metric which quantifies path alignment based on pair wise path alignment and (ii) Path <b>Alignment</b> <b>Indicator</b> that measures the effectiveness of the retrieved path based on degree centrality. The effectiveness of the two proposed metrics is validated using bug reports extracted from the Eclipse project...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{probabilistic}} model of sequence evolution, allowing indels of arbitrary length, and give sequence alignment algorithms for our model. Previously implemented evolutionary models have allowed (at most) single-residue indels or have introduced artifacts {{such as the}} existence of indivisible "fragments. " We compare our algorithm to these previous methods by applying it to the structural homology dataset HOMSTRAD, evaluating the accuracy of (1) alignments and (2) evolutionary time estimates. With our method, it is possible (for the first time) to integrate probabilistic sequence <b>alignment,</b> with reliability <b>indicators</b> and arbitrary gap penalties, in the same framework as phylogenetic reconstruction. Our alignment algorithm requires that we evaluate the likelihood of any specific path of mutation events in a continuous-time Markov model, with the event times integrated out. To this effect, we introduce a "trajectory likelihood" algorithm (Appendix A). We anticipate that this algorithm will be useful in more general contexts, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations...|$|R
40|$|This {{quantitative}} study examines whether standards-based grade reporting accurately informs student academic achievement on standardized criterion-referenced tests for all students. The participants {{for this study}} were all fifth graders enrolled in eight elementary schools in a rural system in north Georgia from 2009 - 2010. Approximately 550 students 2 ̆ 7 standards-based report cards (SBRC) and Criterion Referenced Competency Tests (CRCT) provide the data to determine whether grades on standards-based report cards provide accurate information for all students, regardless of gender, ELL status, or socioeconomic status by comparing mean scores on Georgia 2 ̆ 7 s CRCT in the areas of math and reading, based on SBRC indicators. The findings of this study provide strong implications for school systems considering a standards-based grading reporting system in response to the recent movement towards standards-based curriculums. The results show <b>alignment</b> between <b>indicators</b> on standards-based assessment and scores on criterion-referenced standardized tests, used as an indicator for AYP (Adequate Yearly Progress), adding to the body of research on the effectiveness of standards-based grading in showing student mastery of curriculum standards. For math, even with the same SBRC score, students who are on the free/reduced lunch program tend to score lower than students who are not. For reading, even with the same SBRC score, females tend to score higher than males, those with limited English proficiency tend to score lower than those who are proficient, and those who are on the free/reduced lunch program tend to score lower than those who pay for lunch. The study provides evidence to suggest that standards-based grade reporting provides accurate information regarding student learning that {{can be used as a}} measure of student achievement...|$|R
40|$|MA (Public Management and Governance), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 This study {{investigates the}} role of managers, {{especially}} senior managers, {{with respect to the}} alignment of individual and institutional performance indicators in the Overstrand Local Municipality. Service delivery is an important issue for South African municipalities and is directly linked to performance management. In order to achieve institutional goals and improve service delivery, the alignment of individual and institutional performance indicators is vital. The managers’ role with respect to alignment is important because they are {{the driving force behind the}} institutional performance management system (PMS) in the municipality. A qualitative research methodology is used in this study and includes a literature study and unstructured interviews. The main objective of this research is to determine {{the role of}} management in the alignment of individual and institutional performance indicators in the Overstrand Local Municipality using a municipal scorecard model. The secondary objectives include the formulation of descriptions of the theoretical models and principles of performance management, and the principles and legislative requirements for a comprehensive PMS; determining challenges that managers experience in aligning institutional and individual performance indicators using a municipal scorecard model; and proposing recommendations based on best practice examples towards a management framework that will facilitate the effective alignment of individual and institutional performance indicators. The findings of the study were that the <b>alignment</b> of performance <b>indicators</b> in the Overstrand Local Municipality is unsuccessful, especially at the lower levels. Theoretically, alignment is possible, but the practical implementation thereof remains a challenge. The negative perceptions, attitudes and behaviours that employees exhibit in relation to performance management, both institutional and individual, also came to the fore. Furthermore, employees do not understand the concept and importance of institutional performance. This clearly shows a lack of alignment in the municipality and managers have a very important role to fulfil in order to ensure alignment. Additionally, the challenge that managers experience in inculcating a performance culture in the municipality is particularly evident in the manner in which performance planning, communication, leading and monitoring are done. Various recommendations were made to the Overstrand Local Municipality regarding the <b>alignment</b> of performance <b>indicators</b> through the management functions of planning, organising, leading and control. The implementation of these recommendations will enable the municipality’s senior managers to create a positive performance culture, which should be reflected in the manner in which individual performance is managed. Moreover, the recommendations will assist the managers to align individual and institutional performance, positively influence service delivery and ensure organisational responsiveness to community needs.

40|$|Tutorialpg. 129 An update and a {{demonstration}} of the reverse <b>indicator</b> <b>alignment</b> method with graphical plotting are presented. Hot alignment methods are not covered, but it should be clear that heat rises (falls) can be plotted directly on the graph. Only sizing (scale) differentiates the alignment of pumps from compressors. The scaling presented herein is typical. Reverse indicator tooling and an alignment training model will be discussed. The concentration here is on the pure steps of alignment. The training model allows the movement of a motor relative to a pump. The pump is fixed and the motor is the moveable unit with the coupling feet (near) and outboard feet (far) adjustable by screw travel. Each foot can be adjusted vertically up and down with traversing indicators, as well as horizontally, left and right, with traversing indicators. A flexible coupling remains in place as the shaft is rotated with reverse indicator bars in place. The reverse indicator weights are carried by the motor and pump shafts, i. e., the reach bar only supports its own weight, reducing ?bar sag. ? Reverse indicator dials, as well as motor foot travel indicators, read out in mil subdivisions (1 mil= 0. 0014 in= 25. 4 ?M). While computer programs for two case alignment checking are available, it is not the preferred method for many situations. Graphical plotting is quite simple, equally as fast, leaves a clear maintenance record, can expand to any number of units in a train and allows for any combination of heat movements...|$|R
40|$|The {{microstructure}} of a slip zone from {{a recent}} landslide was investigated by combined optical mi-croscopy (OPM) and backscattered electron micros-copy (BEM) techniques. Along the toe of the slope, the slip zone consisted of two distinct segments, formed a) along a pre-existing slip zone and b) through completely decomposed granite (CDG), both of which comprise composite soils. The microstructural fea-tures were systematically captured, quantified, and analyzed using an advanced image-analysis system. It is shown that variations in density, porosity, presence of matching fragments of coarse particles, abundance of tabular aggregates and plates of kaolinite and particle <b>alignment</b> are significant <b>indicators</b> of the de-formation history of the slip zone. The results indicate that multiple processes concurred {{in the course of}} deformation: compaction and dilation, cataclasis and comminution, and particle rearrangement. Such deformation features of the natural composite soils are fundamentally different from the relatively simple soils commonly used in laboratory studies. The extent of each process depends on the particle-size distribution and stress level that prevailed at time of failure. The particle movement and micro-structural evolution of the slip zone could be described as particulate flow through simultaneous bulk simple shear and pure shear. Depending on their relative abundance, fine particles play an important but variable {{role in the development of}} the slip zone and the mobilization of its shear resistance to de-formation. Reactivation and/or prolonged deforma-tion evidently change the deformation behavior of the pre-existing slip zone. In general, shape-preferred orientation of particles occurs where they are obviously aligned...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well-established}} observationally {{that the}} characteristic angular momentum axis on small scales around AGN, traced by radio jets and the putative torus, is not well-correlated with the large-scale angular momentum {{axis of the}} host galaxy. In this paper, we show that such misalignments arise naturally in high-resolution simulations in which we follow angular momentum transport and inflows from galaxy to sub-pc scales near AGN, triggered either during galaxy mergers or by instabilities in isolated disks. Sudden misalignments can sometimes be caused by single massive clumps falling into the center slightly off-axis, but more generally, they arise even when the gas inflows are smooth and trace only global gravitational instabilities. When several nested, self-gravitating modes are present, the inner ones can precess and tumble in {{the potential of the}} outer modes. Resonant angular momentum exchange can flip or re-align the spin of an inner mode on a short timescale, even without the presence of massive clumps. We therefore do not expect that AGN and their host galaxies will be preferentially aligned, nor should the relative <b>alignment</b> be an <b>indicator</b> of the AGN fueling mechanism. We discuss implications of this conclusion for AGN feedback and BH spin evolution. The misalignments may mean that even BHs accreting from smooth large-scale disks will not be spun up to maximal rotation, and so have more modest radiative efficiencies and inefficient jet formation. Even more random orientations are possible if there is further, un-resolved clumpiness in the gas, and more ordered accretion may occur if the inflow is slower and not self-gravitating.
