25|$|In World War II the {{original}} airfield {{was used to}} house the Royal Navy Observer School HMS Goshawk. From 1942 it was also used by both the United States Army Air Forces Sixth Air Force and United States Navy air squadrons. The airport was used both as a transport airfield and also for <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>patrol</b> flights over the south Caribbean. It was returned to civil control after the war.|$|E
25|$|Robinson took <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>patrol</b> station {{northwest}} of Saipan {{that day and}} closed the shore at night to provide illumination fire and send salvos into enemy troops east of Marpi Point. She shifted her fire to the west, to Tanapag Harbor the following morning and during the afternoon, rescued 17 Marines from a reef north of the harbor {{where they had been}} isolated by one of the biggest banzai attacks of the war.|$|E
25|$|Robinson {{served on}} <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>patrol</b> off Saipan, {{in the ocean}} area {{northwest}} of Maniagassa Island, until 20 July, then got underway with Overton (APD-23) to escort 11 LCTs which arrived off Guam the next morning. She resumed fire support off Saipan that evening. On 22 July Robinson shifted her fire to Tinian, hitting caves where the enemy had dug in. She bombarded the western shore of Tinian 25 and 26 July; and, after gunfire support on the 29th, she guarded the minesweepers in Asiga Bay.|$|E

25|$|On 3 February 1962 her {{conversion}} {{was completed}} to an Advance Aviation Base Ship (one of two ships of the steam-powered LST-1153-class) and redesignated USS Tallahatchie County (AVB-2.) Her aft superstructure was extended forward and her forecastle built up; electronic antennas {{and a heavy}} king post were mounted amidships. As an AVB, Tallahatchie County was designed to provide command and logistic facilities to a squadron of P-2 Neptune or P-3 Orion <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>patrol</b> planes operating from an improvised land base in Souda Bay, Crete. Squadron equipment was carried in mobile vans, transported in Tallahatchie County's tank deck, and landed over her bow ramp.|$|E
25|$|From October 1943 Coast Guard Patrol Bombing Squadron Six {{operated}} twelve Consolidated PBY Catalinas from Narsarsuaq Air Base, Naval Station Argentia, and Reykjavík Airport providing reconnaissance, <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>patrol,</b> mail delivery, rescue service, {{and observation}} surveys of ice conditions for ships of the Greenland Patrol. Aircraft greatly improved patrol efficiency when weather conditions were suitable for flying. Ships of the Greenland Patrol acted as plane guards on weather patrol {{stations in the}} Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, and south of Cape Farewell maintaining radio contact with trans-Atlantic aircraft flights and provided rescue service for aircraft ditching at sea.|$|E

On 10 December, she cleared the anchorage {{and moved toward}} the Philippines in TG 38.1. On 14–15 December, during carrier strikes against Luzon, San Franciscos planes were employed on <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>patrol</b> and in rescue work. On 16 December, the force headed for a rendezvous with TG 30.17, the replenishment force. A typhoon interrupted the refueling operations; and the ships rode out the storm {{for the next two}} days. On 19 December, she participated in a search for survivors from three destroyers which had gone down during the typhoon.|$|E

25|$|The U-boat threat lessened in 1917, when {{merchant}} ships began travelling in convoys, {{escorted by}} destroyers. This tactic {{made it difficult}} for U-boats to find targets, which significantly lessened losses; after the hydrophone and depth charges were introduced, accompanying destroyers could attack a submerged submarine with some hope of success. Convoys slowed the flow of supplies, since ships had to wait as convoys were assembled. The solution to the delays was an extensive program of building new freighters. Troopships were too fast for the submarines and did not travel the North Atlantic in convoys. The U-boats had sunk more than 5,000 Allied ships, at a cost of 199 submarines. World War I also saw the first use of aircraft carriers in combat, with launching Sopwith Camels in a successful raid against the Zeppelin hangars at Tondern in July 1918, as well as blimps for <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>patrol.</b>|$|E
500|$|Brown {{commenced}} {{his basic}} flight training in Fairchild PT-19s [...] at Pine Bluff, Arkansas on 20 August 1941.

The third and final phase was completed at Kelly Field, Texas, where he received his pilot's wings on 7 March 1942. He officially transferred to the Air Corps on 4 April, and was promoted to first lieutenant on 18 June. His first assignment after flight training was at Barksdale Field, Louisiana, where, {{as a member of the}} 344th Bombardment Squadron of the 93d Bombardment Group, he flew Consolidated B-24 Liberator.

2500|$|During World War II, {{to supply}} and augment {{extensive}} amphibious aircraft <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>patrol</b> operations ongoing {{from the early}} days of the war, the United States built an airbase on Ascension Island, known as [...] "Wideawake", after a nearby colony of sooty terns (locally called 'wideawake' birds because of their loud, distinctive constant (day-and-night) cawing chatter. The airbase, which was under construction by the 38th Combat Engineer Battalion of the Army Corps of Engineers, was unexpectedly visited by two British Fairey Swordfish torpedo planes on 15 June 1942. According to one of the pilots, Peter Jinks, the planes were fired upon before being recognised as allies. The Swordfish had to land on the unfinished airstrip, thus becoming the first aircraft to land on Ascension Island proper— which had long served as an ASW base for Catalina (PBY Catalina) flying boats. The event was commemorated with a postage stamp 15 June 1982.|$|E
2500|$|By April 1942, with convoy escorts desperately needed, {{five of the}} Australian-built corvettes {{including}} Bendigo {{were assigned}} to the ANZAC Area covering the eastern approaches to Australia, a zone that was shortly later reorganized into the new Southwest Pacific Area. Operations during this period included convoy duty during the Japanese submarine attacks on Australia's east coast. By September 1942, in the buildup at Port Moresby and Milne Bay in New Guinea escorting convoys and providing <b>antisubmarine</b> <b>patrol.</b> During Operation Lilliput, small convoys from Milne Bay to Oro Bay supporting the campaign at Buna-Gona, she was providing escort for the Dutch ship [...] on 8 March 1943 when that ship came under air attack and was sunk with Bendigo rescuing the survivors. In Operation Accountant, a simultaneous effort with Lilliput to move the United States 162nd Infantry Regiment from Australia to the New Guinea front, the ship was one of four corvettes involved in the New Guinea convoy segment. Bendigo and HMAS Moresby were escorting convoy OC-86 from Melbourne to Newcastle during the 11 April 1943 attack in which the cargo ship Recina was sunk that signalled resumption of submarine activity after a lull.|$|E
