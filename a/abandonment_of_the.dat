5|$|A {{waterspout}} {{has been}} proposed as a possible reason for the inexplicable <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mary Celeste.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{city at the}} end of the Classic Period, many of {{the sculptures}} fell down the steep {{embankment}} supporting the seven terraces.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{continued}} intensive activity in the site core, in Panorama Sector and the other peripheral residential sectors there was a diminishing of activity compared to the Late Classic, perhaps {{leading up to the}} <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E
25|$|Al-Matira survived <b>the</b> <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> Samarra by <b>the</b> caliphs, and {{remained}} occupied {{at least until}} the 13th century.|$|R
50|$|Boskovich {{loved the}} Opera, he loved {{everything}} French, such as Ravel's music and French art, while he equally loved <b>the</b> Jewish melodies <b>of</b> Eastern Europe. But in Israel---he felt and preached---everything must start afresh---perhaps requiring <b>the</b> <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> old loves and passions.|$|R
25|$|The tunnel {{was also}} {{affected}} by the August 1948 floods. The damage caused by these floods led to <b>the</b> <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway network in <b>the</b> south east <b>of</b> Scotland.|$|R
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Kingdom of Italy's <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Axis on 8 September 1943, Germany seized and de facto incorporated Italian territories into its direct control.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} {{levels of}} the Quiriguá valley increased rapidly after the successful rebellion against Copán in 738, although {{it was never a}} heavily populated site. In the 9thcentury there was a severe decline in population, culminating in the <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E
5|$|After {{both were}} reacquired by the Ward Line, Orizaba and Siboney {{were placed in}} transatlantic service on New York–Cuba–Spain routes in 1920, with Orizaba calling at Corunna, Santander, and Bilbao in Spain. The two ships {{accommodated}} 306first-class, 60second-class, and 64third-class passengers, with each ship making several trips on the route, but a lack of passengers (along with the grounding of Siboney at Vigo in September 1920) led to the <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> route.|$|E
25|$|After <b>abandonment,</b> {{buildings}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Sussex Railroad deteriorated {{and track}} was removed. The Newton passenger depot was demolished in November 1970. <b>The</b> final bit <b>of</b> track between Andover and Stanhope/Netcong was removed in July 1977.|$|R
500|$|With <b>the</b> defeat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ionian fleet, {{the revolt}} was {{effectively}} over. Miletus was closely invested, the Persians [...] "mining {{the walls and}} using every device against it, until they utterly captured it". According to Herodotus, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> men were killed, and {{the women and children}} were enslaved. Archaeological evidence partially substantiates this, showing widespread signs <b>of</b> destruction, and <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city in <b>the</b> aftermath <b>of</b> Lade. However, some Milesians did remain in (or quickly returned to) Miletus, though the city would never recapture its former greatness.|$|R
25|$|An {{increasingly}} {{dry climate}} in the 4th and 5th centuries led to <b>the</b> <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southern cities, including Niya and Krorän, with a consequent shift <b>of</b> trade from <b>the</b> southern {{route to the}} northern one.|$|R
5|$|Although Jean-Jacques Dessalines, {{a pivotal}} {{figure in the}} Haitian Revolution, is barely {{mentioned}} in the novel, the one page dedicated to him emphasizes his connection to African gods while neglecting to mention any of his other features that made him an effective leader. While Dessaline's belief in African gods is highlighted, Henri Christophe's <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> religion is stressed, being identified {{as the reason for}} his downfall.|$|E
5|$|In 1923 an Act of Parliament {{was passed}} authorising <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway. its effects were {{auctioned}} on 8 August 1924 {{and the final}} general meeting wound the company up on 7 July 1925. The debenture holders received 70% of the nominal value of their holdings and the shareholders received nothing.|$|E
5|$|Despite England {{going into}} the series as the favourites, West Indies won the series 1–0 after winning the first match at Sabina Park. The {{remaining}} matches all ended in draws. The series was originally intended as a four Test series; however the <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second Test due to {{the conditions of the}} field at the SVR Stadium in Antigua led to the rapid inclusion of an additional game staged at the Antigua Recreation Ground, resulting in a five, rather than four match Test series.|$|E
50|$|After a {{long period}} <b>of</b> <b>abandonment,</b> <b>the</b> site was re-occupied in the Hellenistic and Roman periods.|$|R
50|$|During rule <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, the Yevlax-Ağdam-Xankəndi(Stepanakert) line {{connected}} the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region with <b>the</b> main part <b>of</b> Azerbaijan. After <b>the</b> Nagorno-Karabakh war and <b>the</b> <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> Ağdam, <b>the</b> line’s service was {{cut back to}} service only between Yevlax and Kətəlparaq, without any present section at the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. The former railway line between Kətəlparaq and Stepanakert has been almost completely destroyed.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> {{apparent}} <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> Tumbe, <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Chwaka {{was established}} {{just south of}} Tumbe. Archaeological surveys show that <b>the</b> stonetown <b>of</b> Chwaka started as a small village and grew into a large, densely populated town. <b>The</b> patterns <b>of</b> population show that while Chwaka grew, the surrounding areas became less populated suggesting a movement <b>of</b> people from <b>the</b> countryside into towns.|$|R
5|$|Goldschmidt {{was elected}} to the Portland City Council in 1970 and then as mayor of Portland in 1972, {{becoming}} the youngest mayor of any major American city. He promoted the revitalization of Downtown Portland and was influential on Portland-area transportation policy, particularly with the <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mount Hood Freeway and the establishment of the MAX Light Rail. He was appointed U.S. Secretary of Transportation by President Jimmy Carter in 1979; in that capacity he worked to revive the ailing automobile industry and to deregulate several industries. He served until the end of Carter's presidency in 1981 and then served as a senior executive with Nike for several years.|$|E
5|$|Gomułka, in {{his public}} speeches, criticized {{the hardships of}} Stalinism and promised reforms to democratize the country; this was {{received}} with much enthusiasm by Polish society. By mid-November, Gomułka had secured substantive gains in his negotiations with the Soviets: the cancellation of Poland's existing debts, new preferential trade terms, <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unpopular Soviet-imposed collectivization of Polish agriculture, and permission to liberalize policy towards the Roman Catholic Church. In December, the status of Soviet forces in Poland, the Northern Group of Forces, was finally regulated.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 {{review of}} the genus Gyromitra, authors van Vooren and Moreau say that Bosc's {{original}} species description is ambiguous, leaving much room for interpretation, and they suggest that several reports of the species occurring in Europe should be referred to Gyromitra fastigiata. They point out that in 1970, Estonian mycologist Ain Raitviir considered Bosc's Morchella caroliniana a nomen dubium, and Fries's description as nomen confusum, and advocated the <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specific epithet caroliniana. In the early 1970s, Kent McKnight redefined the taxon and selected a neotype, based on five specimens collected from Lorton, Virginia in 1942.|$|E
2500|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{proposed}} changes during <b>the</b> 1980s, some <b>of</b> Jeffery Matthews's designs were later used: the horizontal format served {{for the first}} self-adhesive stamps in 1993 and for the [...] "higher rate" [...] stamps of 2006.|$|R
50|$|Guelma was re-established as {{a formal}} {{settlement}} during <b>the</b> French invasion <b>of</b> Algeria, after seven centuries <b>of</b> <b>abandonment.</b> <b>The</b> annexation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area began with <b>the</b> advancing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Army going to Constantine from Annaba (<b>the</b> occupation <b>of</b> Constantine would make north-eastern Algeria officially {{a part of}} France) who discovered (and temporarily occupied) <b>the</b> ruins <b>of</b> Calama from 10-15 November 1836 under <b>the</b> command <b>of</b> general Bertrand Clausel.|$|R
50|$|By 1915, the {{population}} peaked at 750 residents. Two banks functioned in the town, until both failed about 1929. A combination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fires, The Great Depression and <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed railroad from Vinita to Coffeyville resulted in <b>the</b> large-scale <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> Centralia. <b>The</b> 1980 census recorded 43 residents. By 2010, only 7 or 8 inhabitants remained in ZIP Code is 74301.|$|R
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 26March, Jourdan {{arranged}} for the <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> positions in Engen and Stockach. Saint Cyr had already withdrawn along the Danube, after his and Vandamme's assaults on the Austrian right failed, and was working his way west toward the Black Forest. Inexplicably, {{at least at the}} time, the Austrians failed to pursue the retreating French; instead of pursuing the French, Charles ordered his army into cantonments at Stockach and Engen, as far south as Wahlweiss. The Aulic Council, in establishing a plan of battle, had forbidden his approach to the Rhine until Switzerland was also cleared of the French army; Charles simply held his ground.|$|E
5|$|Temple 32 (Structure 5D-32) stands {{immediately}} {{to the east of}} Temple 33. It was partially investigated in the mid-1960s and dates to {{the first half of the}} 7th century AD. The temple shrine contained three large chambers, which were looted soon after the <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city in the 10th century. Archaeologists discovered a tomb cut into the bedrock under the pyramid, which contained a royal burial (Burial 195). The pyramid was built over the tomb soon after the king's burial and consisted of a single construction phase.|$|E
5|$|The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal {{opened in}} 1827, which {{provided}} an easier route than the river, and protracted legal battles followed over {{ownership of the}} river and water rights for the canal. These were not finally resolved until 1832, when the Canal Company formally took over the river navigation. The ability to navigate the river gradually deteriorated, not helped by the <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River Parrett as a navigation in 1878. Following flooding in Taunton in 1960, much of the river between there and its mouth was straightened, and the navigation locks were removed. That at Ham was blown up by the Territorial Army. Navigation rights were repealed in 1967.|$|E
2500|$|During rule <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, the Yevlax-Ağdam-Xankəndi(Stepanakert) line {{connected}} the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Region with <b>the</b> main part <b>of</b> Azerbaijan. [...] After the Nagorno-Karabakh war and <b>the</b> <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> Ağdam, <b>the</b> line’s service was {{cut back to}} service only between Yevlax and Kətəlparaq, without any present section at the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. [...] The former railway line between Kətəlparaq and Stepanakert has been almost completely destroyed.|$|R
50|$|Contemporary history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{municipality}} {{has been}} marked by growing emigration, <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> economic recourse and <b>the</b> <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> traditional activities. <b>The</b> institutionalization <b>of</b> local government permitted a revitalization in the municipality, after the Carnation Revolution, which saw a growth in tertiary activities.|$|R
50|$|After <b>the</b> <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> {{traffic on}} <b>the</b> Werdau-Wünschendorf (Elster) section on 30 May 1999, the Werdau bypass was built {{parallel}} with the Leipzig-Hof railway, cutting the line between Werdau and Werdau West. In addition, the flying junction with the Saxon-Bavarian Railway in Werdau was removed.|$|R
5|$|The Byzantine Empire's {{military}} {{position in}} the Balkans collapsed in the early 7th century {{as a result of}} disastrous military ventures against the Persians and then the Arabs in the East, which forced the effective <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Danube limes and opened the way for large-scale penetration and settlement of the Balkan hinterland by various Slavic tribes. The Slavs raided as far as southern Greece and the coasts of Asia Minor. Most of the region's cities were sacked or abandoned and only a few, including Thessalonica, remained occupied and in imperial hands.|$|E
5|$|The area is {{nowadays}} {{sparsely populated}} {{as the result}} of urbanization after World War II. Many of the dwellings now remain shut, while <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional rural economy has affected the cultural landscape. Epirus, of which Vikos–Aoös is part, {{is considered one of the}} most underdeveloped regions in Greece. Tourism constitutes the principal source of revenue for the local economy, although it has a highly seasonal character. Intense development in terms of accommodation and tourism infrastructure occurred in the 1980s, mainly through state initiatives.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{served as}} a prison for war heroine Luisa Cáceres de Arismendi between November 1815 and January 1816. She was held captive by the Spanish forces on an attempt to bow down her husband, Juan Bautista Arismendi, who was {{the chief of the}} {{patriotic}} forces on the island. Simón Bolívar's arrival to the island prompted the partial destruction and <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fort in May 1816. By 1899, the facility serviced as headquarters, and later as quarters for the National Army. It was declared as a National Monument in 1965.|$|E
50|$|After {{several years}} <b>of</b> <b>abandonment,</b> <b>the</b> abbey is {{currently}} home to <b>the</b> Community <b>of</b> Madre Margherita Marchi (Benedictine nuns) since 1941.|$|R
25|$|No mine <b>abandonment</b> plans— either <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunnels or the caverns, {{known as}} voids— were made {{prior to the}} 1872 Mining Act.|$|R
50|$|After {{mountain}} pastures {{became increasingly}} uncultivated {{as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> housing <b>of</b> livestock and <b>the</b> <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> haymaking, <b>the</b> plateaux <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern Black Forest were initially reforested, predominantly with spruce, whose roots could not penetrate the bunter sandstone soil to any great depth. As a result, when the storm hit <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> Baden-Württemberg, around 30 million cubic metres of wood was torn from the ground within <b>the</b> space <b>of</b> two hours.|$|R
