40|$|A {{low energy}} beam {{transport}} (LEBT) {{has been designed}} for a CW microtron and a beam test has been done. The LEBT transports a 500 MHz- 80 keV electron beam to the CW microtron. A peak beam current is 100 mA. The LEBT consists of two solenoid magnets, a bending magnet, a quadrupole magnet, and a chicane magnet. Fringe fields of the bending magnets are optimised by adjusting gaps of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>pole</b> pieces (clamps) of the bending magnets. Calculation and measurement results of magnetic fields show that a field integral (FINT) related to the fringe field {{is proportional to the}} gaps of the clamps. A three dimensional calculation result of the FINT is within accuracy of 0. 5 %. The beam test shows that measured emittances are in good agreement with a calculated emittance. ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{the design of the}} IFUSP main race-track {{microtron}} accelerator end magnets. This is the last stage of acceleration, composed of an accelerating section (1. 04 m) and two end magnets (0. 1585 T), in which a 5. 10 MeV beam, produced by a race-track microtron booster, has its energy raised up to 31. 15 MeV after 28 accelerations. Poisson code was used to give the final configuration that includes <b>auxiliary</b> <b>pole</b> pieces (clamps) and auxiliary homogenising gaps. The clamps avoid the beam vertical defocusing and the horizontal beam displacement produced by extended fringe fields (EFF); Ptrace code was used to perform the trajectory calculations in the fringe field region. The auxiliary homogenising gaps improve the field uniformity as they create a “magnetic shower ” that provides uniformity of ± 0. 3 % before the introduction of the correcting coils. The method of correction that employs correcting coils, used in the microtron booster magnets, enabled uniformity of ± 0. 001 % in an average field of 0. 1 T. ...|$|E

50|$|The {{traction}} motors are {{mounted on the}} truck frames (see above), which protects them from impact when rolling over rail joints and reduces the train's unsprung weight. The first ER2s had the same DK-106B {{traction motors}} as the ER1; these were DC series motors (the armature and field windings were connected in series, as is normal for variable-speed DC motors) with 4 main and 4 <b>auxiliary</b> <b>poles</b> and wavy armature windings. The motor's clamp voltage was 1500 V, and the insulation was designed for 3000 V (which gave a 2-fold safety margin). Unlike locomotive traction motors, these motors normally operated in weak field, with maximum field strength used only during acceleration. The motors are self-cooling (the cooling fan is fixed on the motor's output shaft); the cooling air is taken in through air intakes above the passenger doors.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{unedited}} race-control algorithm (RCA) for the full-bridge passive resonant commutated poles (FB-PRCP) converter {{is presented}} and implemented {{in cost effective}} field programmable gate-array. It compensates the drawbacks of that topology {{that are related to}} the slow dynamics of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>poles</b> which are necessary to obtain zero-voltage transitions both at turn-on and turn-off conditions and makes possible its use in more general welding applications, such as manual metal arc welding, in which very fast responses are required. The proposed RCA is a simple variation of the traditional phase-shift technique, which leads to significant efficiency improvements. The guiding idea is to apply the phase-shift technique to both legs of the converter, contrarily to what has been done to date. The limitation in dynamics of the converter is completely eliminated and it gains much more readiness. The effectiveness of the RCA has been verified in simulation and it can be experimentally tested on a true converter. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved micro-step voltage-fed actuator {{for an automobile}} active grill shutter (AGS) system. A novel structured stepper motor, which contains both the main and auxiliary teeth in the stator, is proposed for the actuator. In a normal permanent magnet (PM) motor coils are generally wound on all the stator teeth, however, in the proposed motor, the winding is only on the main teeth. Because {{of the absence of}} coils in the auxiliary teeth, the proposed stepper motor possesses the following advantages: simple structure, lighter weight, smaller volume, and less time consumption. The unique <b>auxiliary</b> <b>poles</b> in the stepper motor supply the flux path to increase the step resolution even without any coils. The characteristics of the proposed stepper motor were investigated using finite element analysis. In particular, the effect of the magnetization distribution of the PM on the motor performance was investigated during the analysis. Cogging torque, which causes noise and vibration issues, was minimized by the tooth-shape optimization. In addition, a micro-step voltage-fed algorithm was implemented for a high-resolution position control. By employing a current close to a sine wave using space vector pulse-width modulation, a high-quality current waveform with a high resolution was obtained. Finally, the proposed prototype was fabricated, and the cogging torque, back-electromotive force, and current characteristics were measured by mounting the prototype on the AGS system. Both the analysis and experimental results validate the performance improvement from the proposed motor and its possible application for the flap control of the AGS system...|$|R

Based on this analysis, an average-value model of the ARCP converter is derived and used to explore the output characteristics of the ARCP converter.

40|$|A {{study of}} the <b>Auxiliary</b> Resonant Commutated <b>Pole</b> (ARCP) {{converter}} and a comparison with standard hard-switched inverters is presented. A thorough description of the AELCP circuit topology is made with three switching scenarios discussed: commutation from a diode, commutation from a switch with low current, and commutation from a switch with high current. The efficiency of the ARCP inverter is attributed {{to the fact that}} switching losses are eliminated by switching under zero voltage or zero current conditions. To accomplish this task, addition circuitry is introduced which colntributes to additional conduction losses. An example H-bridge is presented using both ARCP phase legs and hard-switched phase legs. Losses for each case are calculated and a comparison is made. From simulations, it is shown that the additional conduction losses introduced by the ARCP circuit are small in comparison with the switching losses found in a standard hard-switched circuit. A simulation of a three-phase example ARCP inverter is briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Fast-switching power {{converters}} {{are a key}} enabling technology for the More Electric Aircraft (MEA), but the generated Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) poses significant challenges to the electrification effort. To meet the stringent aerospace EMI standards, passive filters are commonly employed, despite the weight and size constraints imposed by the MEA. Alternatively, the EMI source, i. e., the high dv/dt and di/dt slew rates, can be addressed through waveform-shaping techniques. For example, while most soft-switching converters can reduce switching loss, they do so by switching the semiconductor devices in a slower and smoother manner, resulting in the attenuation of high-frequency harmonics. This paper examines the <b>Auxiliary</b> Commutated <b>Pole</b> Inverter (ACPI) topology, and its first contribution is the attenuation of the high-frequency content of its EMI source, that is, the output voltage, in a predictable manner, through the active control of the resonant circuit. This is achieved by firstly discussing the time-domain characteristics of trapezoidal and S-shaped pulse-trains that lead to attenuated high-frequency harmonic content, and secondly, by analysing the equivalent LC circuit of the ACPI. The design of the inverter is then focused on the active control of the resonant parameters, for a predetermined and enhanced output voltage high-frequency response. The second contribution {{of this paper is}} the comparison of the EMI performance of hard switching and of three soft-switching modes, fixed-timing control, variable-timing control, and capacitive turn-offs, and how this informs important metrics like power efficiency, current stress, and implementation complexity. Lastly, the third contribution is on the trade-offs that arise when the primary design goal is enhanced EMI performance, as opposed to switching loss reduction. A 5 -kW, 3 -phase ACPI prototype is used for validating the high-frequency content attenuation at source. It is shown that the ACPI can achieve a 37 -dB harmonic attenuation of its output voltage at 4 MHz, compared to a hard-switched inverter...|$|R

It is shown in this paper that the ARCP technique can be very efficiently used in multicell flying capacitor converters. The main properties of the resulting soft switching multicell converter {{are very similar to}} those of the hard-switched version. They are presented and validated by simulations as well as experimental results. In practice, due to the damping, the ARCP multicell converter can suffer from switching faults as in two-level ARCP inverters, but in the case of a multicell converter failures can occur in different cells. So, the main control strategies are evaluated and the switching process is discussed step by step, taking account of the main imperfections of actual control circuits. When they can occur, the switching faults are described and analyzed. Finally, an original quasisoft switching control that should give a high safety of operation is proposed.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate {{the use of the}} <b>Auxiliary</b> Resonant Commutated <b>Pole</b> Converter (ARCP) as a DC-to-AC power converter. The advantages and disadvantages of resonant converters over non- resonant, or hard-switched converters, are investigated. Basic ARCP circuit operation is modeled, with emphasis placed on examining the commutation between high and low voltage states. Detailed ARCP converter operation is modeled in software and compared to a software model of a hard-switched converter. Comparisons are made using total harmonic distortion calculations, to establish the reliability of using the hard-switched model to perform control synthesis for the ARCP. Several control algorithms are tested through simulation and the results analyzed. The advantages of performing control in the synchronous vice stationary reference frame are shown. Testing on a reduced-scale circuit model using a digital signal processing system (dSPACE) to implement control algorithms is used to validate the control algorithm simulations.

40|$|International audienceThe imbricated-cell {{multilevel}} converter is {{well suited}} to high power applications. It allows the series connection of n switches with natural voltage sharing between these switches enabled through the connection of n- 1 flying capacitors. This paper deals with the application of soft-switching on this topology; to date, only the hard-switching mode has been studied. The use of soft switching enables an increase of the switching frequency (resulting in the size reduction of the flying capacitors) without a decrease of the converter efficiency. Of the soft switching methods considered, the <b>Auxiliary</b> Resonant Commutated <b>Pole</b> (ARCP) technique was chosen due to the relative ease in which it {{can be incorporated into}} the converter topology. Furthermore, this technique offers numerous advantages: loss reduction, no added stress to the switches and compatibility with PWM control. The main properties of the ARCP multicell converter are the same as the hard-switched topology: an increase of the apparent output switching frequency and natural self-balancing of the flying-capacitor voltages. This paper presents the results of both simulations performed and measurements taken from an experimental set-up in order to study the viable system functioning. The introduction of soft-switching strongly complicates the theoretical study of the balancing mechanisms, however. As a result, the authors depend on simulations to validate the natural balancing effect during soft switching. Lastly, a general method of loss measurement is presented.

40|$|A design {{technique}} for kW level switching mode power amplifiers is presented. Several push pull pairs, independently tuned to Class E/Fodd, are combined by a distributed active transformer. The zero voltage switching (ZVS) condition is investigated and modified for the Class-E/Fodd amplifier with a non-ideal output transformer. All lumped elements including the DAT, the transistor package, and the input power distribution network are modeled and optimized {{to achieve the}} ZVS condition and the high drain efficiency. Two power amplifiers are implemented at 29 MHz, following the technique. The amplifier with two push pull pairs combined exhibits 1. 5 kW output power with 85 % drain efficiency and 18 dB gain. When four push pull pairs are combined, an output power of 2. 7 kW is achieved with 79 % drain efficiency and 18 dB gain. Nonlinear stability analysis techniques, based on an <b>auxiliary</b> generator and <b>pole</b> zero identification, are introduced to predict and eliminate the instabilities of power amplifiers. The techniques are applied to two switching mode power amplifiers that exhibited different instabilities during the measurements. Self-oscillation, chaos, and hysteresis of a Class E/Fodd amplifier with a distributed active transformer are investigated by the stability and bifurcation analysis tools. An in-depth analysis of the oscillation mechanism is also carried out, which enables an efficient determination of the topology and location of the required global stabilization network. As the other application, the anomalous behavior observed in a Class-E power amplifier is analyzed in detail. It involves hysteresis in the power-transfer curve, self oscillation, harmonic synchronization, and noisy precursors. To correct the amplifier performance, a new {{technique for}} elimination of the hysteresis is proposed, based on bifurcation detection through a single simulation on harmonic-balance software. Also, investigated are the circuit characteristics that make the noisy precursors observable in practical circuits and a technique is derived for their elimination from the amplifier output spectrum. All of the stabilization and correction of the amplifiers are experimentally validated. A simple nonlinear technique {{for the design of}} high efficiency and high-power switching-mode oscillators is presented. It combines existing quasi-nonlinear methods and the use of an auxiliary generator in harmonic balance. The auxiliary generator enables the oscillator optimization to achieve high output power and dc to rf conversion efficiency without affecting the oscillation frequency. It also imposes a sufficient drive on the transistor to enable the switching mode operation with high efficiency. The oscillation start-up condition and the steady state stability are analyzed with the pole-zero identification technique. The influence of the gate bias on the output power, efficiency, and stability is also investigated. A Class E oscillator is demonstrated using the proposed technique.
