40|$|Abstract By {{eroding the}} {{obstacles}} to the cross-border provision of services, the European Community has exacerbated the subcontractors’ position in the internal market, without providing for special protective rules. The absence of a Community minimum standard can only leave {{the door open for}} Member States to provide individual systems of protection at the national level. The peculiarities of the local construction industry have made resulting subcontracting being intensively regulated in France through Law n° 75 - 1334, which, failing payment by the contractors, grants subcontractors a direct <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> vis-à-vis the employer. This pronouncement of the authoritative mixed Chambers of the French Supreme Court, which grants a direct action to all subcontractors working in a building site localized in the territory of France irrespective of the applicable law to the subcontract, seems to establish a protectionist application of the protective rules of Law n° 75 - 1334. Although apparently intended to avoid discrimination based on nationality, application of Law n° 75 - 1334 based on territoriality effectively reduces the competitive advantage that subcontractors legally employed in France, though being nationals of other States or having their establishment abroad, might have with respect to French subcontractors. Foreign subcontractors’ right to equal treatment in the host country is unquestionable, but it is doubtful whether concerns of unfair competition and social dumping by means of rules governing working conditions, which seems to be the disguised fears on which this judgment is founded, can be approved of in the internal market. ...|$|E

40|$|As <b>payment</b> <b>for</b> {{environmental}} services (PES) initiatives spread to collectively managed natural resources, questions arise because the incentive structures {{that might be}} appropriate for individually managed resources will not necessarily promote the collective action required to manage the commons.

Possible ways to reconcile this disconnect involve conceiving of PES more broadly {{through the use of}} multiple forms of payment including non-cash incentives and placing greater focus on building institutions <b>for</b> collective <b>action</b> than on strict conditionality...|$|R
50|$|The Cape Provincial Division, in Ryland v Edros, {{held that}} a court may {{recognise}} and enforce contractual obligations arising out of Muslim marriages, provided that those marriages are monogamous.

The duty of support was found to be legally enforceable for monogamous Muslim marriages, but the issue of polygyny was left open. It was in Kahn v Kahn that spouses in polygynous Muslim marriages were finally held, in terms of the Maintenance Act, to have a legally enforceable duty of support to one another.|$|R

40|$|<b>Payments</b> <b>for</b> {{environmental}} services (PES) are increasingly discussed as appropriate mechanisms for matching {{the demand for}} {{environmental services}} with the incentives of land users whose actions modify the supply of those environmental services.

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>Payments</b> <b>for</b> Environmental Services (PES) has gained {{increasing}} {{popularity in the}} conservation literature as it offers the potential to reconcile opposing social and ecological objectives by paying land owners for the positive environmental externalities they generate on their land. Based on extensive fieldwork in Matiguás, Nicaragua, this paper aims to complement the literature on locally-financed PES schemes in agricultural watersheds. Using both qualitative and quantitative research approaches, it inquires into the under-researched demand-side potential by assessing local willingness to pay (WTP) for water and watershed services in an upstream-downstream setting. Our results show a significant WTP for improved water services and a clear local consciousness about upstream-downstream interdependencies, suggesting potential for a ‘Coasean’ water-related PES scheme. Contrary to expectations, the feasibility of such a locally-financed PES system is however undermined by prevailing local perceptions of agricultural externalities and entitlements, questioning the fairness of such payments. Also low levels of mutual trust seem to undermine {{the credibility of the}} PES framework. The viability and acceptance of locally-financed PES mechanisms will thus also depend on the prior social production of cognitive synergies and improved collective <b>action.</b> <b>Payments</b> <b>for</b> Environmental Services; Watershed; Willingness to pay; Fairness; Externalities; Institutions...|$|R

40|$|Thesis Abstract The main {{topic of}} this thesis is the European order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedure, which {{was adopted by}} the Regulation No. 1896 / 2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (ES) {{creating}} a European order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedure, adopted on 12 December 2006. This thesis describes events preceding the adoption of the Regulation, the procedure of adoption of the Regulation, as well as, development of the content of individual provisions of the Regulation and the content of the actual adopted and binding Regulation. In this thesis, the European order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedure is also compared with nati- onal orders <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedures in the Czech Republic, France and Germany. The selection of these three countries was not unintentional. The Czech Republic was chosen because the thesis was written in the Czech language, in the Czech Republic and shall also be published in the Czech Republic, therefore the author believes the majority of potential readers know the Czech order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> better than any other order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedure. This aspect was also the main reason why the Czech order <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> is described {{at the beginning of this}} thesis. The German and French orders <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> procedures were chosen because the European Commission claims the French " injonction de payer" and the German " [...] ...|$|R
