5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} {{has been}} suggested as <b>another</b> <b>potential</b> cause. Insects are attracted to lights making them scarcer within the amphibian habitats.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>potential</b> protocarnivorous pitfall trap is {{a species}} of teasel, Dipsacus fullonum, which has been only {{suggested}} as a possible carnivore. Only one major study has examined D. fullonum for carnivory and no evidence of digestive enzymes or foliar nutrient absorption was revealed.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{the existence of}} lakes of liquid water entirely encased in Europa's icy outer shell and distinct from a liquid ocean thought to exist farther down beneath the ice shell. If confirmed, the lakes could be yet <b>another</b> <b>potential</b> habitat for life.|$|E

5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>potential</b> {{health problem}} is {{spinal muscular atrophy}} (SMA), another genetically {{inherited}} disease which causes {{the loss of the}} spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs. Symptoms are normally seen within 3–4 months of age and result in muscle atrophy, muscle weakness, and a shortened life span. A test is offered to detect the genes responsible for SMA.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>potential</b> {{source of}} lithium is the {{leachates}} of geothermal wells, which are {{carried to the}} surface. Recovery of lithium has been demonstrated in the field; the lithium is separated by simple filtration. The process and environmental costs are primarily those of the already-operating well; net environmental impacts may thus be positive.|$|E
5|$|By 1973, Nelson had {{returned}} to music, finding success with Atlantic Records. Now based in Austin, Texas, he had made inroads into {{the rock and roll}} press by attracting rock audiences. Atlantic Records was now attempting to sign Jennings, but Nelson's rise to popularity persuaded RCA to renegotiate with Jennings before losing <b>another</b> <b>potential</b> star.|$|E

5|$|Disadvantages {{resulting}} from the nature of orbital mechanics would make {{the arrangement of the}} orbits of the swarm extremely complex. The simplest such arrangement is the Dyson ring, in which all such structures share the same orbit. More-complex patterns with more rings would intercept more of the star's output, but would result in some constructs eclipsing others periodically when their orbits overlap. <b>Another</b> <b>potential</b> problem is that the increasing loss of orbital stability when adding more elements increases the probability of orbital perturbations.|$|E
5|$|India {{was also}} viewed as <b>another</b> <b>potential</b> {{operator}} of the Su-33. The Indian Navy planned {{to acquire the}} Su-33 for its aircraft carrier, the INS Vikramaditya, the refurbished Soviet Admiral Gorshkov, which was sold to India in 2004. In the end, the rival MiG-29K was opted for, because of the Su-33's outdated avionics. The size of the Su-33 reportedly led to concerns over potential difficulties in operating it off the Indian carriers, a constraint not shared by the smaller MiG-29K.|$|E
5|$|Morchella snyderi can be {{distinguished}} from similar North American morels by differences in ecological and morphological features. M.frustrata resembles young specimens of M.snyderi, but the ridges of the caps of the former species do not darken in maturity, and it has smaller ascospores, measuring 20–29 by 14–19µm. <b>Another</b> <b>potential</b> lookalike, M.brunnea, has a browner fruit body color in young specimens, and a stipe that is not lacunose.|$|E
50|$|The {{surge of}} {{depolarization}} traveling from the axon hillock to the axon terminal {{is known as}} an action potential. Action potentials reach the axon terminal, where the action potential triggers the release of neurotransmitters from the neuron. The neurotransmitters that are released from the axon continue on to stimulate other cells such as other neurons or muscle cells. After an action potential travels down the axon of a neuron, the resting membrane potential of the axon must be restored before <b>another</b> action <b>potential</b> can travel the axon. This {{is known as the}} recovery period of the neuron, during which the neuron cannot transmit <b>another</b> action <b>potential.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> area of <b>potential</b> {{research}} interest involves PGO waves during lucid dreaming, active {{imagination and}} hallucination.|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> highly debated <b>potential</b> {{climate change}} {{mitigation}} strategy is Cap and Trade due to its direct relationship with the economy.|$|R
5|$|Soon {{after the}} bat's {{discovery}} in the 1970s, some roosting sites became disturbed {{as a result}} of tourism, scientific collection, and even the collection and sale of individuals as souvenirs. However, these pressures may not have had a significant effect on the species as a whole, since many small colonies exist in hard-to-access locations, and only a few major caves were disturbed. <b>Another</b> <b>potential</b> risk is the activity of local monks, who have occupied roost caves during periods of meditation.|$|E
5|$|The Touchet {{beds are}} formed of {{sediment}} which deposited during the various Missoula Floods, around 16,450 to 13,750BCE, {{and during the}} Bonneville Flood that occurred in approximately 12,500BCE. <b>Another</b> <b>potential</b> source for periodic flooding, still somewhat controversial, is flood release by jökulhlaups from subglacial lakes in British Columbia, but no specific source for these jökulhlaups has yet been identified.|$|E
5|$|Wales {{has some}} {{potential}} for the onshore production of oil and gas. Shale gas may be obtained by fracking and there is methane in unmined coal seams that may be extractable. <b>Another</b> <b>potential</b> source of gas is the underground controlled combustion of coal seams to produce syngas, a mixture of hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide.|$|E
40|$|In {{the fall}} of 2008, the U. S. {{subprime}} mortgage loans defaults have turned into Wall Street’s biggest crisis since the Great Depression. As hundreds of billions in mortgage-related investments went bad, banks became suspicious of one <b>another’s</b> <b>potential</b> undisclosed credit losses and preferred to reduce their exposure in the interbank markets, thus causing interbank interest rates and credit default swaps increases, a liquidity shortage problem and a worsened credit crunch condition to consumers and businesses. Massive cash injections into money markets and interest rates reductions have been assured by central banks {{in an attempt to}} shore up banks and to restore confidence within the financial system. Even Governments have promoted bail-out deal agreements, protections from bankruptcies, recapitalizations and bank nationalizations in order to rescue banks from disastrous bankruptcies...|$|R
25|$|When the membrane's voltage becomes low enough, the {{inactivation}} gate reopens and {{the activation}} gate closes {{in a process}} called deinactivation. With the activation gate closed and the inactivation gate open, the Na+ channel is once again in its deactivated state, and is ready to participate in <b>another</b> action <b>potential.</b>|$|R

5|$|Although it {{has survived}} years of wear and warfare, {{one of the}} palace's wings is now in danger of {{collapsing}} into the Black Sea below. Cracks have begun {{to appear in the}} library, housing almost 10,000 books and manuscripts. Although Edward Blore had a state-of-the-art drainage system built into the palace's foundation, years of neglect and the construction of a nearby sewage pipe in 1974 have helped to increase the potential for a landslide. <b>Another</b> <b>potential</b> looming disaster is surrounding the medieval-style gatehouse near the palace's west side.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>potential</b> Guitar Hero {{project was}} {{discovered}} by the archival site Unseen64 for a game titled Hero World, a massively multiplayer online game that would link the Guitar Hero and DJ Hero games. The game had been developed by FreeStyleGames, sometime {{after the release of}} DJ Hero 2, with the main development duties passed to Virtual Fairground, using their platform The Ride, an Adobe Flash-based platform that would let the game be played in a web browser. The game was cancelled in 2011 along with other pending Guitar Hero projects.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>potential</b> {{source of}} income was the {{prospect}} of a Spanish dowry from a marriage between Charles, Prince of Wales, and Infanta Maria Anna of Spain. The policy of the Spanish Match, as it was called, was also attractive to James as a way to maintain peace with Spain and avoid the additional costs of a war. Peace could be maintained as effectively by keeping the negotiations alive as by consummating the match—which may explain why James protracted the negotiations for almost a decade.|$|E
50|$|Parameter {{sets and}} {{functional}} forms {{are defined by}} interatomic potentials developers to be self-consistent. Because the functional forms of the potential terms vary extensively between even closely related interatomic potentials (or successive {{versions of the same}} interatomic potential), the parameters from one interatomic potential function should clearly never be used together with <b>another</b> interatomic <b>potential</b> function.|$|R

50|$|During {{the action}} {{potential}} before the hyperpolarization phase, the membrane is unresponsive to any stimulation. This inability to induce <b>another</b> action <b>potential</b> {{is known as}} the absolute refractory period. During the hyperpolarization period, the membrane is again responsive to stimulations but it requires a much higher input to induce an action potential. This phase {{is known as the}} relative refractory period.|$|R
5|$|As Feodora grew older, various suitors were {{considered}} for marriage. The exiled Prince Peter Karađorđević, thirty-six years her senior, unsuccessfully requested {{her hand in}} marriage. <b>Another</b> <b>potential</b> candidate was her cousin Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In late 1897, Feodora became engaged to Prince Henry XXX of Reuss, and they married the following year, on 24 September 1898 in a Lutheran ceremony at Breslau. The groom was fifteen years older than his bride and a captain in a Brunswick regiment, but not wealthy or particularly high-ranked. Many in the family were shocked at the marriage, but the Dowager Empress was at least pleased that her granddaughter seemed happy with the match.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of the Austrian Empire's war with the Ottoman Empire, and similar Russian Empire's war, Polish king Stanisław August Poniatowski, {{attempted}} to draw Poland into the Austro-Russian alliance, seeing a war with the Ottomans as an opportunity to strengthen the Commonwealth. Due to internal Russian politics, this plan was not implemented. Spurned by Russia, Poland turned to <b>another</b> <b>potential</b> ally, the Triple Alliance, represented on the Polish diplomatic scene primarily by the Kingdom of Prussia. This line of reasoning gained support from Polish politicians such as Ignacy Potocki and Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius vinosus, {{formerly}} {{considered a}} variety of L.sanguifluus, is quite similar in appearance. In general, L.vinosus can be distinguished by the more vinaceous-red color (lacking orange tones) of its cap, stipe, and gills, the more distinctly downwards-tapered stipe, and the more intense staining of the latex on the cap tissue. The two species can also be distinguished microscopically by differences in the ornamentation of their spore surfaces. L.vinosus has an incomplete reticulum on the spore surface, with ridges that have a wider degree of variation in thickness. <b>Another</b> <b>potential</b> lookalike, L.semisanguifluus, has a characteristic orange latex that turns wine-red in 5–10 minutes after exposure to air. Compared to L.sanguifluus, the fruit bodies of L.semisanguifluus are smaller, have tinges of violet in the cap, and develop a greenish discolouration with age.|$|E
