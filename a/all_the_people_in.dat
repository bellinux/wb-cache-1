5|$|In early 1594, the Serbs in Banat rose {{up against}} the Ottomans. The rebels had, in the {{character}} of a holy war, carried war flags with the icon of Saint Sava. The war banners were consecrated by Patriarch Jovan Kantul, and the uprising was aided by Serbian Orthodox metropolitans Rufim Njeguš of Cetinje and Visarion of Trebinje (s. 1590–1602). In response, Ottoman Grand Vizier Koca Sinan Pasha demanded that the green flag of the Prophet Muhammed be brought from Damascus to counter the Serb flag and ordered that the sarcophagus containing the relics of Saint Sava be removed from the Mileševa monastery and transferred to Belgrade via military convoy. Along the way, the Ottoman convoy killed <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> its path as a warning to the rebels. The Ottomans publicly incinerated the relics of Saint Sava on a pyre atop the Vračar plateau on April 27, 1595, and had the ashes scattered.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 10 May, {{elements}} of the VC 1st Regiment attacked Ngok Tavak, and they successfully overran much of the outpost. By dawn, the 11th MSF Company was devastated, but they later received reinforcements which {{came in the form of}} the 12th Mobile Strike Force Company. Despite having received assurances that further reinforcements would arrive to relieve the outpost, the commander of the 11th MSF Company decided to evacuate his troops and move towards Khâm Đức. By that time, however, the VC 1st Regiment had already turned their attention to the main target at Khâm Đức, and they only left behind some local force units to destroy allied reinforcements. Meanwhile, elements of the Americal Division had been airlifted into Khâm Đức as part of Operation Golden Valley, to bolster the strength of the Special Forces Camp there. On the morning of 11 May, the North Vietnamese 2nd Division surrounded Khâm Đức, and they gradually forced United States-led forces into their bases after several outposts were overrun. Westmoreland then ordered Khâm Đức to be evacuated, so the 834th Air Division was told to make an all-out effort to extract <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> Khâm Đức, both military and civilian. By the time the evacuation was completed, nine U.S. military aircraft had been shot down, including two C-130s. On 12 May, the North Vietnamese were in complete control of Khâm Đức.|$|E

50|$|The old {{concept of}} Natio Hungarica came {{to play a}} role in the {{development}} of early nationalism based on the French model.Ľudovít Štúr indirectly demanded that all people (including peasants) living in the Kingdom of Hungary have their own representatives in the Diet. He indicated thenew constitutional subject that is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Hungary should become the Natio Hungarica. This involved the amendment of the meaning of the traditional class concept Natio Hungarica and the extension of its frame to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hungarian Kingdom. His attempt at <b>the</b> transformation of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>in</b> kingdom into Natio Hungarica constituted an attempt at <b>the</b> transformation of <b>all</b> ethnic groups in Hungarian Kingdom into Natio Hungarica.Only with the abolition of nobility and the development of Hungarian nationalism did natio Hungarica begin to develop an ethnic sense.Lajos Kossuth identified the historical-political rights of king and corporations in the Kingdom of Hungary with the national rights of theMagyars.|$|R

25|$|Later that night, the fairies take Aurora back to {{the castle}} and leave her alone in a room to wait for her {{birthday}} celebrations where she will finally get to see her parents. Maleficent then appears and magically lures Aurora away from the fairies and tricks the princess into touching an enchanted spinning wheel. Aurora pricks her finger, completing the curse.

25|$|Seeking {{refuge from}} the waswās means that the seeker after refuge himself seeks God's refuge from its evil, i.e. from the evil lest it should whisper some evil {{suggestion}} into his own heart. The second meaning is that the caller to truth seeks God's {{refuge from the}} evil {{of the one who}} whispers evil suggestions into the hearts of the people against himself. It is not in his own power to approach <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> whose hearts evil suggestions are being whispered against himself individually and remove the misunderstandings of every person. It is also not right and proper for him that he should give up his mission of inviting others to God and should devote all his tune and energy to removing the misunderstanding created by the whisperer and to answering their accusations. It is also below his dignity that he should stoop to the level of his opponents. Therefore, God has instructed the caller to truth to seek only His refuge from the evil of the wicked people, and then to attend single-mindedly to his work of invitation and mission. For it is not for him to deal with them but for God, who is Sustainer of men, King of men, God of men.|$|E

500|$|Staci Krause of IGN had a {{positive}} outlook on the episode, mainly due to the heavy development the episode's plot had in the season's progressive arc.

Regarding the episode an [...] "epic" [...] one, she praised the scene which depicts O'Malley realizing the intoxication provoked by the patient's blood. [...] "This is what we come to expect from medical dramas and it is great to see Grey's get back to this, while not sacrificing the personal stories", stated Krause, putting the emphasis on how [...] "this case brought out the hore in just about everyone, pushing their limits for a patient".

500|$|Following {{the retreat}} of the Confederate army, the Banu Qurayza {{neighbourhood}}s were besieged by the Muslims, in revenge.

On {{the request of}} the Banu Aus, who were allied to the Qurayza, Muhammad chose one of them, Sa'ad ibn Mu'adh, as an arbitrator to pronounce judgment upon them. Sa'ad, who would later die of his wounds from the battle, decreed the sentence according to the Torah, in which the men shall be killed and women and children enslaved. [...] says: [...] When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. If they accept and open their gates, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city. When the Lord your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it.
