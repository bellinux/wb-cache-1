A sign test is employed to construct different indices of bubbles in representative financial markets for each region, using dynamic factor models. These indices permit a characterization to be made of each region in terms of risk and, also, of the occurrence of financial bubbles. Evidence is found that indicates a certain degree of synchronization between episodes of financial bubbles in the markets analyzed and, generally, at international level...|$|R
40|$|Could either {{monetary}} policy or financial prudential regulation be relied on individually to mitigate asset price cycles or their effects? If both ways are effective, {{monetary policy}} and prudential regulation {{could then be}} considered “substitutes, ” {{in the sense that}} the individual use of either instrument leads to a reduction in the volatility of both corresponding targets. This note, however, argues in favor of complementarity—rather than substitution—in the use of monetary and macroprudential policies: the combined (articulate) use of both policies tends to be more effective than a standalone implementation of either. Monetary Policy, Asset Prices, and Financial Stability Asset price cycles had been a concern for many years prior to the recent global financial crisis, but were seen as a separate issue that was not a monetary policy concern. Even when the frequent <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> price bubbles started to be acknowledged, the belief was—“the Greenspan-Bernanke approach” 1 —that attempts to detect and prick them at an early stage would be impossible and potentially harmful. If necessary, mopping up after the bubble burst would be safer, usin...|$|R

Besides geometrical preservation, preserving the current <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> historical <b>assets</b> is an important and urgent component of our project, due to the daily decay and stain of these ancestral statues and buildings. For this purpose, we have been developing frameworks and algorithms to capture the <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> real world objects accurately and efficiently. In this paper, we will overview several of these algorithms, namely, appearance modeling from a densely/sparsely sampled image sequence, and image-based shape modeling of transparent objects. These methods can synthesize appearance under novel viewing and lighting conditions, which becomes important when building multimedia contents <b>of</b> historical <b>assets,</b> as well as precisely preserving the appearance itself...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} whether {{credit rating}} downgrades feed {{back on the}} <b>asset</b> value <b>of</b> the downgraded companies, causing real losses. To investigate this issue we construct a structural credit risk model incorporating ratings and the feedback loss. To estimate {{the parameters of the}} model we develop a maximum likelihood estimator using time series of equity prices and credit ratings. Implementing the model on a sample of US public firms downgraded from investment grade to junk, we find strong support for the existence of feedback losses. First, estimated feedback losses are significant for a third of our sample with the cross-sectional averages of the feedback loss around 7 %. Second, the behavior <b>of</b> estimated <b>asset</b> volatilities around downgrades in real data is consistent with the predictions of our model. We observe a hump-shaped pattern <b>of</b> estimated <b>asset</b> volatilities when feedback is ignored. Using the feedback model, the hump-shaped pattern disappears. These findings suggest that ignoring feedback can lead to the <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> changing <b>asset</b> volatility even when the real volatility is constant. Last, accounting for feedback helps in asset volatility prediction. Credit Ratings; Credit Risk; Distress Costs; Maximum Likelihood; Option Pricing...|$|R

A certain amount of visual repetition has always been accepted by players, however as technology improves and game worlds tend towards more detail, the repetition <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> in games becomes more obvious. Particularly graphically advanced games require an increasing number <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> to hide the repetition and to create believable game worlds.
