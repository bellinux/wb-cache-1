The man, Vogel, tells Iris the owl's current location: hidden in a disused movie theatre nearby, guarded by men with illegal modified <b>automatic</b> weapons. <b>Iris</b> is immediately shocked: she was never given any warning that the owl could be so heavily guarded, and her casual investigation could have gotten her shot.

40|$|Abstract. The {{dramatic}} {{growth in}} practical applications for iris biometrics {{has been accompanied}} by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. Among others, one of the most active research areas concerns about the development of iris recognition systems less constrained to users, either increasing the image acquisition distances or the required lighting conditions. The main point {{of this paper is to}} give a process suitable for the <b>automatic</b> segmentation of <b>iris</b> images captured at the visible wavelength, on-the-move and within a large range of image acquisition distances (between 4 and 8 meters). Our experiments were performed on images of the UBIRIS. v 2 database and show the robustness of the proposed method to handle the types of non-ideal images resultant of the aforementioned less constrained image acquisition conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of iris recognition systems is frequently affected by input image quality, {{which in turn}} is vulnerable to less-than-optimal conditions due to illuminations, environments, and subject characteristics (e. g., distance, movement, face/body visibility, blinking, etc.). VASIR (Video-based <b>Automatic</b> System for <b>Iris</b> Recognition) is a state-of-the-art NIST-developed iris recognition software platform designed to systematically address these vulnerabilities. We developed VASIR as a research tool that will not only provide a reference (to assess the relative {{performance of}} alternative algorithms) for the biometrics community, but will also advance (via this new emerging iris recognition paradigm) NISTâ€™s measurement mission. VASIR is designed to accommodate both ideal (e. g., classical still images) and less-than-ideal images (e. g., face-visible videos). VASIR has three primary modules: 1) Image Acquisition 2) Video Processing, and 3) Iris Recognition. Each module consists of several sub-components that have been optimized by use of rigorous orthogonal experiment design and analysis techniques. We evaluated VASIR performance using the MBGC (Multiple Biometric Grand Challenge) NIR (Near-Infrared) face-visible video dataset and the ICE (Iris Challenge Evaluation) 2005 still-based dataset. The results showed that even though VASIR was primarily developed and optimized for the less-constrained video case, it still achieved high verification rates for the traditional still-image case. For this reason, VASIR may be used as an effective baseline for the biometrics community to evaluate their algorithm performance, and thus serves as a valuable research platform...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} novel scheme for texture {{segmentation}} and representation based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). Texture segmentation and texture characteristic expression are two important areas in image pattern recognition. Nevertheless, until now, {{how to find}} an effective way for accomplishing these tasks is still a major challenge in practical applications such as iris image processing. We propose a framework for ACO based image processing methods. Considering the specific characteristics of various tasks, such a framework possesses the flexibility of only defining different criteria for ant behavior correspondingly. By defining different kinds of direction probability and movement difficulty for artificial ants, an ACO based image segmentation algorithm and a texture representation method are then presented for <b>automatic</b> <b>iris</b> image processing. Experimental results demonstrated that the ACO based image processing methods are competitive and quite promising, with excellent effectiveness and practicability especially for images with complex local texture situations...|$|E

40|$|Iris {{recognition}} {{has been}} developing for over 20 years, but, only {{in recent years has}} it been more accessible and widely accepted {{as one of the most}} accurate and un-obtrusive biometric modalities. Over the past few years, many companies have developed iris acquisition systems that are more user-friendly. Iris-On-the-Move (IOM) is one such system, offering significant stand-off acquisition distance (3 m), which is extremely convenient for users and very suitable for deployment at airports to check passenger identifications and to control access. However, iris images acquired by the IOM and other long range systems are, in most cases, considerably blurred, of low contrast, and lacking detail in the iris texture compared to images from very close proximity sensors (5 cm stand-off). This thesis focuses on how to deal with the three most challenging problems in long-range iris recognition: (1) iris segmentation from long range systems, (2) <b>automatic</b> <b>iris</b> mask generation of occluded regions, (3) iris matching performance enhancement using multiple irises from a video sequence. In particular, we emphasize solutions in the context of th...|$|E

40|$|AIM:To {{discuss the}} single {{application}} on iris localization technology in excimer laser {{for the treatment of}} astigmatism. METHODS:Totally 203 cases(406 eyes) of laser in situ keratomileusis(LASIK) in the treatment of compound myopic astigmatism patients were operated from November 2011 to November 2012 in our hospital. They were divided into two groups. One was observation group using iris localization and the other was control group using routine operation. Patients in the observation group of 100 cases(200 eyes), aged 18 - 43 years old, spherical diopter was - 1. 25 to - 8. 75 D, astigmatism was - 1. 0 to - 3. 25 D. In control group, 103 patients(206 eyes), aged 19 - 44 years old, spherical diopter was - 1. 75 - 9. 50 D, astigmatism was - 1. 0 to - 3. 25 D. The patients in the observation group before the application of WaveScan aberrometer check for iris image, spherical lens, cylindrical lens and astigmatism axis data operation, only single application of iris location, without using wavefront aberration guided technology, laser cutting patterns for conventional LASIK model, spherical, cylindrical mirror and astigmatism axis data source to preoperative wavefront aberration results. The control group received routine LASIK. It was applicated comprehensive optometry optometry respectively to examine astigmatism and axial, based on the computer analysis during the preoperative, 1 wk after the operation, and 6 mo. Analysis of using SPSS 17 statistical software, it was independent-sample t test between the two groups of residual astigmatism and astigmatism axis. RESULTS:Postoperative residual astigmatism, the observation group was significantly better than the control group. Astigmatism axial measurement after operation, the observation group was significantly less than that of the control group. Postoperative visual acuity at 6 mo, the observation group was better than that of the control group. The difference was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: For patients who cannot complete the wavefront aberration guided treatment of astigmatism, can separate the application of wavefront aberration analyzer <b>automatic</b> <b>iris</b> recognition technology to improve precision of astigmatism treatment, give full play to advanced technical performance of equipment, which has good application value...|$|E
