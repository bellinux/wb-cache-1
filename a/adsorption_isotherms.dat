The {{significance}} of β is as given as follows: β[*]=[*] 1 (Langmuir <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherm</b> {{model is a}} preferable <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherm</b> model) and β[*]=[*] 0 (Freundlich <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherm</b> model is a preferable <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherm</b> model).|$|R

50|$|At {{the same}} year (2002) as the {{discovery}} of nanoscale windows, <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherms</b> of hydrogen in internal and interstitialspaces of SWNH assemblies were also determined experimentally, which provided the adsorbed density of hydrogen in internal and interstitial spaces. The fact that the adsorbed density of hydrogen in interstitial spaces is lower than that in internal spaces against the prediction from the interaction potential calculation was explained by the self-stabilization effect of the self-locking mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|Capillary {{condensation}} is {{an important}} factor in both naturally occurring and synthetic porous structures. In these structures, scientists use the concept of capillary condensation to determine pore size distribution and surface area though <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherms.</b> [...] Synthetic applications such as sintering of materials are also highly dependent on bridging effects resulting from capillary condensation. In contrast to the advantages of capillary condensation, it can also cause many problems in materials science applications such as atomic-force microscopy and microelectromechanical systems.|$|E
30|$|The {{experimental}} {{data were analyzed}} using <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherm</b> such as the Freundlich and Langmuir <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherm</b> and kinetic equations such as pseudo first-order, pseudo second-order and intra-particle diffusion equations.|$|R

30|$|Freundlich <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherm</b> is an {{empirical}} <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherm</b> describing the <b>adsorption</b> on heterogeneous surface. This isotherm does not predict any saturation of the adsorbent by the adsorbate, indicating multilayer adsorption.|$|R
5000|$|Zif’s 68, 69, 70, 78, 81, 82, 95, and 100 {{have been}} found to have very high uptake capacity, meaning that they can store a lot of carbon dioxide even if they don’t have {{extremely}} high affinities. Of those, 68, 69, and 70 show high affinities for carbon dioxide, evidenced by their <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherms,</b> which show steep uptakes at low pressures.

50|$|In one of {{the earlier}} studies {{conducted}} by Manes, M., & Hofer, L. J. E., the Polyani theory was used to characterize liquid-phase <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherms</b> on various concentrations activated carbon using {{a wide range of}} organic solvent. The polyani theory was shown to be a good fit for these various systems. Because of the results, the study introduced the possibility of predicting isotherms for similar systems using minimal data. However, the limitation is that the <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherms</b> for a large variety of solvents can only fit over a limited range. The curve was not able to fit the data at high-capacity range. The study also concluded that there were a few anomalies in the results. The adsorption from carbon tetrachloride, cyclohexane, and carbon disulfide onto activated carbon was not able to fit well to the curve, and remain to be explained. The researchers who conducted the experiment speculate that steric effects of carbon tetrachloride and cyclohexane may have played a role. The study has been done with a variety of systems such as organic liquids from water solutions and organic solids from water solutions.|$|E
50|$|He {{was among}} the first to realise and exploit the power of {{statistical}} mechanical treatments for the adsorption of gases and liquids in nano-porous materials (such as carbons, silicas and metal-organic framework materials). Such adsorption processes are central to many separation and purification processes, as well as catalysis. The density functional theory method developed by Gubbins and coworkers is now universally used in analysing <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherms</b> to calculate pore size distributions and porosity of nano-porous materials. More recently he has made major contributions to the characterisation of amorphous porous materials through application of statistical mechanical methods, and to the understanding of diffusion processes and chemical reactions in these materials.|$|E
40|$|Gibbs <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherm</b> of the {{multicomponent}} {{system for}} concentration instead of chemical potential {{as independent variables}} is deduced and explained in a simple way. For the multicomponent system composed of α and β phases with plane interface, if the β phase is a dilute solution, and component k is solvent as well as c_k^α≪ c_k^β, c_i^α≪ c_i^β, Gibbs <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherm</b> of component i can be expressed as Γ_i^(k) = -(c_i^β/RT) (∂γ/∂ c_i^β) _T,p,c_j^β (the dividing surface is placed where the adsorption of component k is zero). The adsorption of some components on the vapor–liquid interface of dilute solution with moderate or low pressure can meet the application condition of this <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherm.</b> The <b>adsorption</b> of various components on the solid–liquid and liquid–liquid interface of dilute solution can also meet the application condition of this <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherm</b> if various components of one phase are virtually insoluble in another phase. <b>Adsorption</b> <b>isotherm,</b> <b>adsorption...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{inhibition}} of copper corrosion by Benzotriazole (BTA) in 5 % HC 1 {{has been investigated}} by weight loss technique at different temperatures. Langmuir <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherm,</b> Freundlich <b>Adsorption</b> <b>Isotherm</b> and Kinetic-Thermodynamic Model were {{used to describe the}} adsorption process depending on values of surface converge. Maximum value of surface converge was 0. 998 for BTA at 35 °C and 15 g/ 1 inhibitor concentration, while the lower value was 0. 868 at 55 °C and 1 g/ 1 inhibitor concentration. The films formed on the copper-nickel alloy surface of BTA appeared to obey the Langmuir <b>Adsorption</b> <b>Isotherm</b> more than Freundlich <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherm.</b> In the other hand, results showed that the Kinetic-Thermodynamic Model was unsuitable to fit the experimental data of the BTA of the present study...|$|R
50|$|The {{secondary}} drying phase aims to remove unfrozen water molecules, since the ice was removed {{in the primary}} drying phase. This part of the freeze-drying process is governed by the material's <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherms.</b> In this phase, the temperature is raised {{higher than in the}} primary drying phase, and can even be above 0 °C, to break any physico-chemical interactions that have formed between the water molecules and the frozen material. Usually the pressure is also lowered in this stage to encourage desorption (typically in the range of microbars, or fractions of a pascal). However, there are products that benefit from increased pressure as well.|$|E
50|$|In {{waste water}} treatment, the most {{commonly}} used adsorbent is granular activated carbon (GAC), often used as to treat both liquid and gas phase volatile organic compounds and organic pollutants. Activated carbon beds vary in lifetime depending on the concentration of the pollutant(s) being removed, their associated <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherms,</b> inlet flow rates and required discharge consents. Life- times of these beds can range between hours and months. Activated carbon is often landfilled {{at the end of its}} useful life but sometimes it is possible to regenerate it restoring its adsorptive capacity allowing it to be re-used. Thermal regeneration is the most prolific regeneration technique but has drawbacks in terms of high energy and commercial costs and a significant carbon footprint. These drawbacks have encouraged research into alternative regeneration techniques such as electrochemical regeneration.|$|E
5000|$|In {{physical}} adsorption, hysteresis {{is evidence}} of mesoporosity-indeed, the definition of mesopores (2-50 nm) {{is associated with the}} appearance (50 nm) and disappearance (2 nm) of mesoporosity in nitrogen <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherms</b> as a function of Kelvin radius. An adsorption isotherm showing hysteresis is said to be of Type IV (for a wetting adsorbate) or Type V (for a non-wetting adsorbate), and hysteresis loops themselves are classified according to how symmetric the loop is. Adsorption hysteresis loops also have the unusual property {{that it is possible to}} scan within a hysteresis loop by reversing the direction of adsorption while on a point on the loop. The resulting scans are called [...] "crossing," [...] "converging," [...] or [...] "returning," [...] depending on the shape of the isotherm at this point.|$|E

The Type Ⅱ <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherm</b> of the original carbon black turned to an <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherm</b> with the JE step after the graphitization.

5000|$|Solid {{solutions}} [...] {{with different}} Zn concentration (0.2 < x < 0.35) {{has been investigated}} {{in the production of}} hydrogen from aqueous solutions containing [...] as sacrificial reagents under visible light. Textural, structural and surface catalyst properties were determined by [...] <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherms,</b> UV-vis spectroscopy, SEM and XRD and related to the activity results in hydrogen production from water splitting under visible light irradiation. It was found that the crystallinity and energy band structure of the [...] solid solutions depend on their Zn atomic concentration. The hydrogen production rate was found to increase gradually when the Zn concentration on photocatalysts increases from 0.2 to 0.3. Subsequent increase in the Zn fraction up to 0.35 leads to lower hydrogen production. Variation in photoactivity is analyzed in terms of changes in crystallinity, level of conduction band and light absorption ability of [...] solid solutions derived from their Zn atomic concentration.|$|E
5000|$|Isotherms in {{the first}} region will show the feature of {{subcritical}} <b>adsorption.</b> <b>Isotherms</b> in the second region will show the feature of mechanism transition. Isotherms in the third region will show the feature of supercritical adsorption. The transition will take a continuous way if the isotherms in {{both sides of the}} critical temperature belong to the same type, such as adsorption on microporous activated carbon. However, discontinuous transition could be observed on isotherms in the second region if there is a transformation of isotherm types, such as adsorption on mesoporous silica gel. The decisive factor in such a classification of adsorption is merely temperature, irrespective of pressure. This is because a fluid cannot undergo a transition to a liquid phase at above-critical temperature, regardless of the pressure applied. This fundamental law determines the different adsorption mechanism for the subcritical and supercritical regions. For the subcritical region, the highest equilibrium pressure of adsorption is the saturation pressure [...] of adsorbate. Beyond [...] condensation happens. Adsorbate in the adsorbed phase is largely in liquid state, based on which different adsorption and thermodynamic theories as well as their applications were developed. For supercritical region, condensation cannot happen, no matter how great the pressure is.|$|E

The purpose of an adsorption isotherm is to evaluate the relation between the fluoride concentrations remaining in the bulk solution to the amount of fluoride adsorbed at the solid/solution interface.
