Tidus' cheerful personality and heroic traits make him <b>an</b> <b>appealing</b> protagonist, contrasting with previous male {{characters in the}} franchise. His character development and romantic relationship with Yuna are considered {{among the best in}} video games, although reviewers and fans were divided on Taylor's voicing. Tidus has been popular with fans, often ranking {{as one of the best}} Final Fantasy characters in polls. Action figures and Tidus-related jewelry have been produced, and he is a popular cosplay character.|$|E
5|$|Author Masaru Takeuchi {{attributes}} {{the origin of}} the quick time event game mechanic to laserdisc games like Dragon's Lair and Time Gal. IGN's Levi Buchanan listed FMV games like Time Gal as one of the reasons behind the Mega-CD's commercial failure, citing them as a waste of the system's capabilities. Ciolek referred to the protagonist {{as one of the first}} human heroines in the industry. He further added that Reika was <b>an</b> <b>appealing</b> lead character that Taito could have easily turned into a mascot and featured in other games and media. The character was later included in Alfa System's shooting game Castle of Shikigami III—Taito published the arcade version in Japan. In the game, Reika features similar attacks and personality but the character's visual design was updated. Reika's most recent appearance was in the Elevator Action remake Elevator Action Deluxe as one of the few free Taito DLCs.|$|E
5|$|At the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), Criterion Games' {{director}} of design Alex Ward {{was approached by}} Bruce McMillan, executive vice president at EA Worldwide Studios. McMillan wanted to reconcile EA's relationship with Criterion and partner with them on a game. Initially, Ward refused, citing their past experience {{of working with the}} publisher. However, EA persisted and suggested Criterion make Burnout 3 with them. Originally, the studio was waiting until the next generation of video game hardware launched before starting work on a third instalment. Criterion accepted the deal on the conditions that EA would not interfere with the game's development and that Criterion had the freedom to create the game they wanted. Development on Burnout 3 began immediately after the expo in June 2003, with a larger team of staff working on the game than its predecessors. By January 2004, Criterion had a build of the game ready to demonstrate to EA. The development team had drafted a number of subtitles for Burnout 3 including Fuel Injection, Crash and Burn, Seek and Destroy, Takedown along with some more ridiculous suggestions like See You in Hell. Internally, they felt that Takedown was not <b>an</b> <b>appealing</b> choice, however the outcome of EA's focus testing proved otherwise. Despite a rocky start in their relationship with EA, Criterion admitted to benefiting from the publisher's experience throughout the course of Burnout 3s development. By July 2004, development on the game was nearly complete with the remaining work confined to bug testing and polishing the experience. On 28 July 2004, EA announced that they had acquired Criterion along with the Burnout intellectual property. McMillan stated that their strong expectations for Burnout 3 and ownership of the series were key reasons for buying Criterion.|$|E

25|$|In many {{synthetic}} processes using {{transition metal}} catalysts, metal nanoparticles {{play an important}} role as the actual catalyst or as a catalyst reservoir. ILs are <b>an</b> <b>appealing</b> medium for the formation and stabilization of catalytically active transition metal nanoparticles. More importantly, ILs can be made that incorporate coordinating groups, for example, with nitrile groups on either the cation or anion (CN-IL). In various C-C coupling reactions catalyzed by a palladium catalyst, it has been found that palladium nanoparticles are better stabilized in CN-IL compared to non-functionalized ionic liquids; thus enhanced catalytic activity and recyclability are realized.|$|E

25|$|NSAAs may be <b>an</b> <b>appealing</b> {{option for}} {{those who wish to}} {{preserve}} sex drive and function and/or fertility, as well as {{for those who}} desire more selective action with fewer side effects than spironolactone and cyproterone acetate (which increase the risk of depressive symptoms, among other adverse effects). Bicalutamide specifically may also be a safer drug than cyproterone acetate or spironolactone, as it has a much lower risk of hepatotoxicity relative to cyproterone acetate and, unlike spironolactone, has no risk of hyperkalemia or other antimineralocorticoid-associated adverse reactions. However, bicalutamide does have a very small risk of hepatotoxicity itself, as well as of interstitial pneumonitis.|$|E

25|$|Research {{indicates}} that anal sex occurs significantly less frequently than other sexual behaviors, but {{its association with}} dominance and submission, as well as taboo, makes it <b>an</b> <b>appealing</b> stimulus to people of all sexual orientations. In addition to sexual penetration by the penis, people may use sex toys such as butt plugs or anal beads, engage in fingering, anilingus, pegging, anal masturbation or fisting for anal sexual activity, and different sex positions may also be included. Fisting is the least practiced of the activities, partly because it is uncommon that people can relax enough to accommodate an object {{as big as a}} fist being inserted into the anus.|$|E
25|$|Jacksonville's {{financial}} sector {{has benefited from}} a rapidly changing business culture, as have other Sunbelt cities like Atlanta, Tampa, and Charlotte. In a concept known as nearshoring, financial intuitions are shifting operations away from high-cost addresses like Wall Street, and have even shifted trading functions to Jacksonville. With relatively low-cost real estate, easy access to New York City, high-quality of life and 19,000 {{financial sector}} employees, Jacksonville has become <b>an</b> <b>appealing</b> option for relocating staff. Perhaps {{the best example of}} this is the growth of Deutsche Bank's presence in the city. Jacksonville is home to Deutsche Bank's second largest US operation, only New York is larger. Other institutions with a notable presence in Jacksonville include Macquarie Group, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Citi, Citizens Property Insurance, Fidelity Investments, Ally Financial and Aetna.|$|E
25|$|Similar to Manga Bookshelf's writers, Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network {{compared}} Watanuki's {{development in}} the series with Subaru's due to how both characters start behaving like close people to them. Matthew Alexander also compared Watanuki's new characterization with Yuko's as it shows him maturing by his no longer throwing angry tantrums and by his unwillingness to forget the witch. Carlo Santos praised Watanuki's role as the shop's new owner due to how he manages to replace Yuko by taking on some of her traits such a calmer demeanor as well as wearing multiple outfits. Leroy Douresseaux from Comic Book Bin liked Watanuki's calm demeanor when dealing with clients which helped to build <b>an</b> <b>appealing</b> atmosphere. Todd Haberkorn's work as Watanuki's English voice actor has been criticized by Santos for making the character sound annoying rather than funny.|$|E
