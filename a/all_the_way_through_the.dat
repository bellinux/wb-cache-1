5|$|During {{the decay}} of plutonium, three types of {{radiation}} are released—alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha, beta, and gamma radiation are all forms of ionizing radiation. Either acute or longer-term exposure carries a danger of serious health outcomes including radiation sickness, genetic damage, cancer, and death. The danger increases {{with the amount of}} exposure. Alpha radiation can travel only a short distance and cannot travel through the outer, dead layer of human skin. Beta radiation can penetrate human skin, but cannot go <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> body. Gamma radiation can go <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> body.|$|E
5|$|All {{communication}} from mobile terminals {{to the base}} stations is encrypted with a key known only to the base station and the terminal. For group conversations, two keys are used, one from the terminal to the base station, and one from the base station to all users. In addition, there are 32 fixed keys used for terminal-to-terminal communication should the base station fall out. In addition, the police can use a user-to-user encryption where the communication is encrypted <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> network from the one user to the other.|$|E
5|$|UA8653, the holotype, is hypsodont and curved. It is 11.2mm high, {{of which}} the crown makes up about 85%, and the {{dimensions}} of its crown are 3.4 x 3.2mm. The occlusal (chewing) surface is worn flat and contains a V-shaped island of dentine surrounded by enamel. One side of the crown lacks enamel. Between the two arms of the V, at the lingual (inner) side of the tooth, is a furrow filled with cementum, which extends <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> tooth; the presence of such a long furrow distinguishes it from Gondwanatherium. The enamel {{is made up of}} small, round prisms (bundles of hydroxyapatite crystals) that are separated by large, continuous bands of interprismatic matrix (IPM; the material between the enamel prisms).|$|E

5|$|Lipid bilayers {{are also}} {{involved}} in signal transduction through their role {{as the home of}} integral membrane proteins. This is an extremely broad and important class of biomolecule. It is estimated that up to a third of the human proteome may be membrane proteins. Some of these proteins are linked to the exterior of the cell membrane. An example of this is the CD59 protein, which identifies cells as “self” and thus inhibits their destruction by the immune system. The HIV virus evades the immune system in part by grafting these proteins from the host membrane onto its own surface. Alternatively, some membrane proteins penetrate <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> bilayer and serve to relay individual signal events from the outside {{to the inside of the}} cell. The most common class of this type of protein is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). GPCRs are responsible for much of the cell’s ability to sense its surroundings and, because of this important role, approximately 40% of all modern drugs are targeted at GPCRs.|$|E
5|$|The New York Automobile Club {{released}} another plan in 1933. This plan made {{no changes}} to NY9A; however, US9 {{was changed to}} use Broadway <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Bronx and to travel to New Jersey {{by way of the}} Holland Tunnel. In the final plan implemented in mid-December 1934, no route was assigned to the Harlem River Drive–Amsterdam Avenue corridor. Instead, NY9A used what had been planned as US9, splitting at Broadway and Dyckman Street. NY9A ran south along the west side of Manhattan on Riverside Drive and the West Side Elevated Highway (detouring around an unfinished section via 57th Street, Eleventh Avenue and 48th Street) to end at the entrance and exit plazas of the Holland Tunnel. US9 was shifted northward to enter New Jersey via the George Washington Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{specimen}} MACN Pv-RN 975, {{first described}} by Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996, {{may be a}} jaw fragment of Ferugliotherium, although {{it has also been}} identified as an unrelated multituberculate. The fossil preserves a bladelike premolar, identified as the fourth premolar, and the piece of the jawbone below it. A diastema (gap) is present between the premolar and the incisor that would have been located in front of it. The alveolus (socket) of the lower incisor extends <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> fossil. The p4 bears eight ridges {{on both sides of the}} longitudinal crest and is supported by two roots at the front and back. The p4 assigned to Argentodites also has eight ridges on both sides, which descend from cusps on the upper margin, and roots at the front and back. According to Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues, it differs from that of MACN Pv-RN 975 in its rounded, as opposed to angular shape. However, Gurovich and Beck attribute this difference to the fact that the latter has undergone much more wear.|$|E

25|$|Another {{method for}} {{piercing}} ears, first made {{popular in the}} 1960s, {{was the use of}} sharpened spring-loaded earrings known as self-piercers, trainers, or sleepers, which gradually pushed through the earlobe. However, these could slip from their initial placement position, often resulting in more discomfort, and many times would not go <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> earlobe without additional pressure being applied. This method has fallen into disuse due to the popularity of faster and more successful piercing techniques.|$|E
25|$|On 9 January 1977, {{the city}} center service was {{extended}} to Sentrum. However, this station was closed from 20 March 1983 to 7 March 1987, and reopened as Stortinget. During {{the last years of}} the 1980s the barres and payment stalls were removed and replaced with a proof-of-payment system. This unmanning of the station allowed for a significant cut in operating costs.

25|$|Even {{with the}} {{presence}} of Friant and numerous other flood control dams, large floods still caused significant damage along the San Joaquin River <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> late 1950s. The passage of the Flood Control Act of 1944 included provisions {{for the construction of a}} levee system along part of the San Joaquin River, but valley farmers were not entirely satisfied. After years of lobbying, farmers convinced the state government to authorize a massive flood-control system of diversion channels and levees whose main component is the Eastside Bypass, so named because of its location east of and parallel to the San Joaquin. Groundbreaking of the huge project was in 1959 and construction was finished in 1966.|$|E
25|$|The stratum {{hosting the}} mega-bonebed has {{different}} sorts of contacts with other strata at different locations across its extent. The most distinct boundaries separate the Hilda bonebed mudstone from other mudstones {{above and below}} it. Less clear boundaries occur where the bonebed mudstone contacts the filled-in remains of an ancient body of flowing water. These contacts record where the channel cut down into the sediment now lithified as the fossil-bearing mudstone. The researchers couldn't find the bed's northern boundary, which they felt might extend north of the northernmost bonebed {{as part of a}} succession of stacked mudstone beds. An ancient channel cut <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> sediments now composing the mudstone, and its deposit forms the Hild bonebed's southern boundary.|$|E
25|$|Planck {{sent this}} result to Rubens, who {{compared}} {{it with his}} and Kurlbaum's observational data {{and found that it}} fitted for all wavelengths remarkably well. On 19 October 1900, Rubens and Kurlbaum briefly reported the fit to the data, and Planck added a short presentation to give a theoretical sketch to account for his formula. Within a week, Rubens and Kurlbaum gave a fuller report of their measurements confirming Planck's law. Their technique for spectral resolution of the longer wavelength radiation was called the residual ray method. The rays were repeatedly reflected from polished crystal surfaces, and the rays that made it <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> process were 'residual', and were of wavelengths preferentially reflected by crystals of suitably specific materials.|$|E

25|$|From 20 November 1995, {{the trains}} on the Grorud Line {{continued}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Common Tunnel to and continued along the Røa Line. In June 2010, the headway {{on the line}} was reduced from 15 to 7.5 minutes, with half the departures terminating at Stortinget. The reason was that the Røa Line was having its power supply upgraded, and Line 2 would {{only be able to}} run with three-car trains. From 6 November 2010, Line 1's eastern service was moved from the Lambertseter Line to the Furuset Line, thus giving eight services per hour along the latter. This was possible because of the upgrade of the Holmenkollen Line to metro standard. The Line 1 services replaced the extra services on Line 2.|$|E
25|$|Union troopers rode <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{wagon train}} {{until they reached}} Ewell's {{infantry}} and captured large numbers of prisoners before returning to repeat the effort. They erected hasty barricades {{in front of the}} wagon train to protect what they had captured. More than 1,300 Confederatesprimarily wounded men in ambulances, but also slaves, free blacks, and some cavalrymenwere captured and most of the wagons were destroyed. Many of the mules survived and were turned over to the Cavalry Corps quartermaster. Kilpatrick later reported that he had destroyed Ewell's entire wagon train, although he had in fact encountered {{only a fraction of the}} full, 40-mile long train. The Confederates lost about 250 wagons and ambulances with casualties from Iverson's and Daniel's Brigades and of three artillery battalions, as well as 37 wagons from Maj. Gen. Robert E.

25|$|A 1954 survey {{concluded}} that there were in all 119, mostly small scale, tank vs. tank actions involving U.S. Army and Marine units during the Korean War, with 97 T-34-85 tanks knocked out and another 18 probables. The M4A3E8 was involved in 50% of the tank actions, the M26 in 32%, and the M46 in 10%. The M26/M46 {{proved to be an}} overmatch for the T-34-85 as its 90mm HVAP round could - at point blank range - punch <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> T-34 from the front glacis armor to the back, whereas the T-34-85 had difficulty penetrating the armor of the M26 or M46. The M4A3E8, firing 76mm HVAP rounds that were widely available during the Korean War (unlike World War II), was a closer match to the T-34-85 as both tanks could destroy each other at normal combat ranges.|$|E
