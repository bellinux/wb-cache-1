5|$|Arguably {{the first}} {{exposition}} of empirical materialism {{in the history}} of philosophy is in the Cārvāka school (also called Lokāyata). The Cārvāka school rejected the existence of anything but matter (which they defined as being made up of the four elements), including God <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>soul.</b> Therefore, they held that even consciousness was nothing but a construct made up of atoms. A section of the Cārvāka school believed in a material soul made up of air or breath, but since this also was a form of matter, it was not said to survive death.|$|E
5|$|Dhumavati is {{a manifestation}} of the anti-social and inauspicious {{elements}} in women and is an antithesis to the goddess Lakshmi. Like Alakshmi, Dhumavati rules over the four months of the rainy season, when even solar light is obscured by the evil water spirit. This coincides with Chaturmas, a period during the year when the god Vishnu sleeps. At that time, darkness rules <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> loses its usual luster. This period is considered inauspicious, and as such as no auspicious ceremonies like marriage can take place.|$|E

5|$|At first, Raziel can jump, glide {{using his}} torn wings, move blocks, {{and pick up}} and throw objects and enemies. Initially unarmed, he fights using his claws, but can {{alternatively}} use weapons such as rocks, torches, spears and staffs, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soul</b> Reaver. Raziel can freely shift to the spectral realm, but can return to the material realm only through special portals when at full health. Raziel automatically shifts to the spectral realm if he runs out of health. As the game progresses, Raziel gains the powers of his clan brothers after defeating them and becomes able to phase through gates in the spectral realm and climb walls in the material realm. Initially vulnerable to water, he overcomes this weakness and learns to swim.|$|E
5|$|Four magical {{disciplines}} are acquired, {{including the}} Fire of Ares, the Ice of Poseidon, the Lightning of Zeus, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soul</b> of Hades, which, {{depending on the}} magic equipped, imbues the Blades of Chaos with that elemental property. For example, the Soul of Hades imbues the Blades with purple flames and can unleash souls of the Underworld to briefly attack enemies. The Ice of Poseidon also enables Kratos to breathe underwater, a necessary ability as substantial time is spent there. The Rage ability called Rage of the Gods that was featured in previous games is included, but in this game, its meter is filled by landing attacks on enemies and the ability is automatically activated once the meter has reached maximum capacity. It remains activated until Kratos is attacked or stops attacking {{for an extended period}} of time, after which the meter must be refilled. The Rage ability is also affected by the magic equipped, allowing Kratos to use different Rage attacks, such as the lightning-based Rage of Zeus.|$|E
5|$|However, {{when the}} marine {{catches up with}} Campbell in the central {{computer}} processing sector of the base, Campbell is mortally wounded and only has enough strength to say that Kelly has taken Campbell's BFG 9000 weapon before expiring. Kelly then begins to taunt the marine in a demonic voice. The marine eventually faces off with Kelly in the central computer core, revealing Kelly as a cybernetic human grafted onto a tank-like base. The marine is able to kill Kelly and takes the BFG 9000 before proceeding deeper under the Martian surface to Site 3, the archaeological dig site where the Soul Cube was unearthed. At the primary excavation site, the marine discovers the Hellmouth, defended by Hell's mightiest warrior, the Cyberdemon. Using the Soul Cube, the marine defeats the Cyberdemon in combat, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soul</b> Cube then seals the Hellmouth. The ending cut scene shows the reinforcements from Earth arriving at the base to discover the carnage. They find the marine alive, but discover that Swann has died. They are, however, unable to locate Betruger, who in the final scene is shown in Hell, reincarnated as a dragon-like demon.|$|E

25|$|For Eastern Orthodox Christians, fasting is an {{important}} spiritual discipline, found in both the Old Testament and the New, and {{is tied to the}} principle in Orthodox theology of the synergy between the body (Greek: soma) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> (pneuma). That is to say, Orthodox Christians do not see a dichotomy between the body <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> but rather consider them as a united whole, and they believe that what happens to one affects the other (this is known as the psychosomatic union between the body <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>soul).</b> Saint Gregory Palamas argued that man's body is not an enemy but a partner and collaborator with the soul. Christ, by taking a human body at the Incarnation, has made the flesh an inexhaustible source of sanctification. This same concept is also found in the much earlier homilies of Saint Macarius the Great.|$|E

5000|$|Christopher <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Souls</b> were an American garage {{rock band}} formed in McAllen, Texas, in 1964. Recording a song {{inspired}} by the poetic writing of Christopher Voss called [...] "Diamonds, Rats, and Gum", Christopher <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Souls</b> {{became one of the}} highlights of the Texas garage scene. Although the group disbanded in 1967, their composition has been rediscovered and highly valued among collectors. Noted for its rarity on the already isolated Pharaoh record label, only a few copies of [...] "Diamonds, Rats, and Gum" [...] are known to exist; however, it is accessible on compilation albums.|$|R
50|$|In {{the third}} century, Origen {{explains}} {{that there are}} two ladders {{in the life of a}} Christian, the ascetic ladder that <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> climbs on <b>the</b> earth, by way of—and resulting in—an increase in virtue, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>soul's</b> travel after death, climbing up the heavens towards the light of God.|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} judged the best album Berkeley has {{released}} yet {{thanks to the}} warmth of the melodies <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> he seems to have poured in it, although some judged it too measured and not emotional enough. This record suggested comparisons with Steve Reynolds, Josh Ritter, Eastmountainsouth, Rosie Thomas, Ray LaMontagne, Ben Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie, Joseph Arthur, Dan Fogelberg and John Denver.|$|E
25|$|Kraus was {{the subject}} of two books by Thomas Szasz, Karl Kraus <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soul</b> Doctors and Anti-Freud: Karl Kraus's Criticism of Psychoanalysis and Psychiatry, which portray Kraus as a harsh critic of Sigmund Freud and of {{psychoanalysis}} in general. Other commentators, such as Edward Timms, have argued that Kraus respected Freud, though with reservations about the application of some of his theories, and that his views were far less black-and-white than Szasz suggests.|$|E
25|$|Another {{belief is}} in an axis mundi or world tree which connects the heavens, the {{terrestrial}} world, and the underworld. In Indian religions, Heaven is considered as Svarga loka, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> is again subjected to rebirth in different living forms according to its karma. This cycle can be broken after a soul achieves Moksha or Nirvana. Any place of existence, either of humans, souls or deities, outside the tangible world (Heaven, Hell, or other) {{is referred to as}} otherworld.|$|E
50|$|The Chiesa del Purgatorio ("Church of the Purgatory") is a Roman Catholic church {{located in}} the city of Ragusa, in {{southern}} Sicily, Italy. The church is dedicated to all saints <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> in purgatory.|$|R
5000|$|His {{third and}} final {{published}} work, a philosophical treatise titled [...] "Knowing the Spirit" [...] (Maʻrifat al-rūḥ), was published in 1969 and describes his ideas on <b>the</b> existence <b>and</b> immortality of <b>the</b> <b>soul,</b> <b>and</b> on <b>the</b> <b>soul's</b> gradual process of maturation and perfection.|$|R

25|$|Socrates {{presents}} {{his third}} {{argument for the}} immortality of the soul, the so-called Affinity Argument, where he shows that the soul most resembles that which is invisible and divine, and the body resembles that which is visible and mortal. From this, it is concluded that while the body may be seen to exist after death {{in the form of}} a corpse, as the body is mortal <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> is divine, the soul must outlast the body.|$|E
25|$|Augustine was not preoccupied, as Plato and Descartes were, with {{going too}} much into details in efforts to explain the metaphysics of the soul-body union. It sufficed for him {{to admit that they}} are metaphysically distinct: to be a human is to be a {{composite}} of soul and body, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> is superior to the body. The latter statement is grounded in his hierarchical classification of things into those that merely exist, those that exist and live, and those that exist, live, and have intelligence or reason.|$|E
25|$|The Brahmanas, Aranyakas, and Upanishads, {{among other}} things, {{interpret}} {{and discuss the}} Samhitas in philosophical and metaphorical ways to explore abstract concepts such as the Absolute (Brahman), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> or the self (Atman), introducing Vedanta philosophy, {{one of the major}} trends of later Hinduism. In other parts, they show evolution of ideas, such as from actual sacrifice to symbolic sacrifice, and of spirituality in the Upanishads. This has inspired later Hindu scholars such as Adi Shankara to classify each Veda into karma-kanda (कर्म खण्ड, action/ritual-related sections) and jnana-kanda (ज्ञान खण्ड, knowledge/spirituality-related sections).|$|E
5000|$|The final {{petition}} made by {{the priest}} is [...] "May his <b>soul</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> of all <b>the</b> faithful departed through the mercy of God rest in peace." [...] At that point, <b>the</b> graveside ceremony <b>and</b> <b>the</b> burial is complete.|$|R
