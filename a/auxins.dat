5|$|Because of the {{presence}} of <b>auxins</b> in Lactifluus piperatus metabolites, it can be applied as a rooting hormone to aid the growth of seedlings of various species of plants, including hazel, beech and oak. In the 19th century, it was used as a folk cure for tuberculosis, though it had no effect. In more recent times, it has been found that L. piperatus can be used as an antiviral agent, and the latex has been used against viral warts.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen {{fixation}} {{plays an}} important role in the nitrogen cycle. Azotobacter also synthesizes some biologically active substances, including some phytohormones such as <b>auxins,</b> thereby stimulating plant growth. They also facilitate the mobility of heavy metals in the soil, thus enhancing bioremediation of soil from heavy metals, such as cadmium, mercury and lead. Some kinds of Azotobacter can also biodegrade chlorine-containing aromatic compounds, such as 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, which was previously used as an insecticide, fungicide, and herbicide, but later was found to have mutagenic and carcinogenic effects.|$|E
5|$|In plants, {{signaling}} by <b>auxins,</b> or phytohormones {{that order}} {{the direction and}} tropism of plant growth, induces the targeting of a class of transcription factor repressors known as Aux/IAA proteins for proteasomal degradation. These proteins are ubiquitinated by SCFTIR1, or SCF in complex with the auxin receptor TIR1. Degradation of Aux/IAA proteins derepresses transcription factors in the auxin-response factor (ARF) family and induces ARF-directed gene expression. The cellular consequences of ARF activation depend on the plant type and developmental stage, but are involved in directing growth in roots and leaf veins. The specific response to ARF derepression {{is thought to be}} mediated by specificity in the pairing of individual ARF and Aux/IAA proteins.|$|E
50|$|The {{regulation}} of PIN protein localisation {{in a cell}} determines the direction of <b>auxin</b> transport from cell, and concentrated effort of many cells creates peaks of <b>auxin,</b> or <b>auxin</b> maxima (regions having cells with higher <b>auxin</b> - a maximum). Proper and timely <b>auxin</b> maxima within developing roots and shoots are necessary to organise {{the development of the}} organ.Surrounding <b>auxin</b> maxima are cells with low <b>auxin</b> troughs, or <b>auxin</b> minima.

40|$|The {{phytohormone}} <b>auxin</b> is {{an essential}} regulator for plant growth and development. Decades of intensive research revealed the mutual importance of <b>auxin</b> metabolism and intercellular cell-to-cell transport for the regulation of spatiotemporal <b>auxin</b> distribution. Just recently, intracellular putative <b>auxin</b> carriers, such as the PIN-FORMED (PIN) 5 /PIN 8 and the PIN-LIKES (PILS) 2 /PILS 5 were discovered at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and seem to limit nuclear <b>auxin</b> signaling via an <b>auxin</b> sequestration mechanism. Moreover, these <b>auxin</b> carriers at the ER might provide a link between <b>auxin</b> compartmentalization and <b>auxin</b> conjugation-based metabolism. Here we review the recent findings on <b>auxin</b> compartmentalization at the ER and discuss its potential contribution to cellular <b>auxin</b> homeostasis and its importance for plant development...|$|R
40|$|The {{signalling}} molecule <b>auxin</b> controls plant morphogenesis via its activity gradients, {{which are}} produced by intercellular <b>auxin</b> transport. Cellular <b>auxin</b> efflux is the rate-limiting step in this process and depends on PIN and phosphoglycoprotein (PGP) <b>auxin</b> transporters. Mutual roles for these proteins in <b>auxin</b> transport are unclear, as {{is the significance of}} their interactions for plant development. Here, we have analysed the importance of the functional interaction between PIN- and PGP-dependent <b>auxin</b> transport in development. We show by analysis of inducible overexpression lines that PINs and PGPs define distinct <b>auxin</b> transport mechanisms: both mediate <b>auxin</b> efflux but they play diverse developmental roles. Components of both systems are expressed during embryogenesis, organogenesis and tropisms, and they interact genetically in both synergistic and antagonistic fashions. A concerted action of PIN- and PGP-dependent efflux systems is required for asymmetric <b>auxin</b> distribution during these processes. We propose a model in which PGP-mediated efflux controls <b>auxin</b> levels in <b>auxin</b> channel-forming cells and, thus, <b>auxin</b> availability for PIN- dependent vectorial <b>auxin</b> movement...|$|R
25|$|To cause {{growth in}} the {{required}} domains, <b>auxins</b> must of necessity be active preferentially in them. Local auxin maxima can be formed by active biosynthesis in certain cells of tissues, for example via tryptophan-dependent pathways, but <b>auxins</b> are not synthesized in all cells (even if cells retain the potential ability to do so, only under specific conditions will auxin synthesis be activated in them). For that purpose, <b>auxins</b> have {{to be not only}} translocated toward those sites where they are needed, but also they must have an established mechanism to detect those sites. For that purpose, <b>auxins</b> have to be translocated toward those sites where they are needed. Translocation is driven throughout the plant body, primarily from peaks of shoots to peaks of roots (from up to down).|$|E
25|$|Used in high doses, auxin {{stimulates the}} {{production}} of ethylene. Excess ethylene (also native plant hormone) can inhibit elongation growth, cause leaves to fall (abscission), and even kill the plant. Some synthetic <b>auxins,</b> such as 2,4-D and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) were marketed also as herbicides. Dicots, such as dandelions, are much more susceptible to <b>auxins</b> than monocots, such as grasses and cereal crops. So, these synthetic <b>auxins</b> are valuable as synthetic herbicides. 2,4-D was the first widely used herbicide, {{and it is still}} so. 2,4-D was first commercialized by the Sherwin-Williams company, and saw use in the late 1940s. It is easy and inexpensive to manufacture.|$|E

40|$|The {{plant hormone}} <b>auxin</b> is central in {{patterning}} diverse plant tissues. The direction of <b>auxin</b> flow {{and the distribution}} of <b>auxin</b> within tissues are regulated by <b>auxin</b> efflux transporters that are polarly localized in cells. Feedback regulation between <b>auxin</b> and its transporters establishes homeostatic patterns of <b>auxin</b> accumulation but allows dynamic repatterning in response to developmental or environmental cues...|$|R
40|$|<b>Auxin</b> {{has long}} been implicated in many aspects of plant growth and {{development}} including flower development. However, the exact roles of <b>auxin</b> in flower development have not been well defined until the recent identification of <b>auxin</b> biosynthesis mutants. <b>Auxin</b> {{is necessary for the}} initiation of floral primordia, and the disruption of <b>auxin</b> biosynthesis, polar <b>auxin</b> transport or <b>auxin</b> signaling leads to the failure of flower formation. <b>Auxin</b> also plays an essential role in specifying the number and identity of floral organs. Further analysis {{of the relationship between the}} <b>auxin</b> pathways and the known flower development genes will provide critical information regarding mechanisms of organogenesis and pattern formation in plants...|$|R
40|$|The {{plant hormone}} <b>auxin</b> plays crucial roles in {{regulating}} plant growth development, including embryo and root patterning, organ formation, vascular tissue differentiation and growth responses to environmental stimuli. Asymmetric <b>auxin</b> distribution patterns {{have been observed}} within tissues, and these so-called <b>auxin</b> gradients change dynamically during different developmental processes. Most <b>auxin</b> is synthesized in the shoot and distributed directionally throughout the plant. This polar <b>auxin</b> transport is mediated by <b>auxin</b> influx and efflux facilitators, whose subcellular polar localizations guide the direction of <b>auxin</b> flow. The polar localization of PIN <b>auxin</b> efflux carriers changes in response to developmental and external cues in order to channel <b>auxin</b> flow in a regulated manner for organized growth. <b>Auxin</b> itself modulates the expression and subcellular localization of PIN proteins, contributing to a complex pattern of feedback regulation. Here we review the available information mainly from studies of a model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, on the generation of <b>auxin</b> gradients, the regulation of polar <b>auxin</b> transport and further downstream cellular events...|$|R
25|$|The most {{important}} plant hormones are abscissic acid (ABA), <b>auxins,</b> ethylene, gibberellins, and cytokinins, {{though there are}} many other substances that serve to regulate plant physiology.|$|E
25|$|<b>Auxins</b> are {{toxic to}} plants in large concentrations; {{they are most}} toxic to dicots and less so to monocots. Because of this property, {{synthetic}} auxin herbicides, including 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, have been developed and used for weed control.|$|E
25|$|However, some exogenously {{synthesized}} <b>auxins,</b> especially 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), {{are also}} commonly applied to stimulate root growth when taking cuttings of plants or for different agricultural purposes {{such as the}} prevention of fruit drop in orchards.|$|E
25|$|Surrounding <b>auxin</b> maxima are {{cells with}} low <b>auxin</b> troughs, or <b>auxin</b> minima. For example, in the Arabidopsis fruit, <b>auxin</b> minima {{have been shown}} to be {{important}} for its tissue development.|$|R

Two of the best studied <b>auxin</b> transporters, ABCB1 and ABCB19, have been characterized to be primary <b>auxin</b> exporters Other ABCB transporters such as ABCB4 participate in both the export and import of <b>auxin</b> At low intracellular <b>auxin</b> concentrations ABCB4 imports <b>auxin</b> until it reaches a certain threshold which then reverses function to only export <b>auxin.</b>|$|R
40|$|In 1969, Tsvi Sachs {{published}} his seminal hypothesis of vascular development in plants: the canalization hypothesis. A positive feedback loop between the flux of the phytohormone <b>auxin</b> and the cells' <b>auxin</b> transport capacity would canalize <b>auxin</b> progressively into discrete channels, {{which would then}} differentiate into vascular tissues. Recent experimental studies confirm {{the central role of}} polar <b>auxin</b> flux in plant vasculogenesis, but it is unclear if and by which mechanism plant cells could respond to <b>auxin</b> flux. In this Opinion article, we review <b>auxin</b> perception mechanisms and argue that these respond more likely to <b>auxin</b> concentrations than to <b>auxin</b> flux. We propose an alternative mechanism for polar <b>auxin</b> channeling, which is more consistent with recent molecular observations...|$|R
25|$|Certain indole {{derivatives}} {{were important}} dyestuffs {{until the end}} of the 19th century. In the 1930s, interest in indole intensified when it became known that the indole substituent is present in many important alkaloids (e.g., tryptophan and <b>auxins),</b> and it remains an active area of research today.|$|E
25|$|This process, polar auxin transport, is directional, very {{strictly}} regulated, {{and based}} in uneven distribution of auxin efflux carriers on the plasma membrane, which send <b>auxins</b> {{in the proper}} direction. While PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins are vital in transporting auxin in a polar manner, the family of AUXIN1/LIKE-AUX1 (AUX/LAX) genes encodes for non-polar auxin influx carriers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Auxins</b> promote root initiation. Auxin induces both {{growth of}} {{pre-existing}} roots and adventitious root formation, i.e., branching of the roots. As more native auxin is transported down the stem to the roots, the overall {{development of the}} roots is stimulated. If the source of auxin is removed, such as by trimming the tips of stems, the roots are less stimulated accordingly, and growth of stem is supported instead.|$|E
40|$|To {{provide a}} {{comparative}} framework {{to understand the}} evolution of <b>auxin</b> regulation in vascular plants, the effect of perturbed <b>auxin</b> homeostasis was examined in the lycophyte Selaginella kraussiana. Polar <b>auxin</b> transport was measured by tracing tritiated IAA in excised shoots. Shoots were cultured {{in the presence of}} <b>auxin</b> efflux inhibitors and exogenous <b>auxin,</b> and developmental abnormalities were documented. <b>Auxin</b> transport in Selaginella shoots is exclusively basipetal, as in angiosperms. Perturbed <b>auxin</b> transport results in the loss of meristem maintenance and abnormal shoot architecture. Dichotomous root branching in Selaginella appears to be regulated by an antagonistic relationship between <b>auxin</b> and cytokinin. The results suggest that basipetal polar <b>auxin</b> transport occurred in the common ancestor of lycophytes and euphyllophytes. Although the mechanisms of <b>auxin</b> transport appear to be conserved across all vascular plants, distinct <b>auxin</b> responses govern shoot growth and development in lycophytes and euphyllophytes. © 2013 New Phytologist Trust...|$|R
40|$|The {{phytohormone}} <b>auxin</b> acts as {{a prominent}} signal, providing, by its local accumulation or depletion in selected cells, a spatial and temporal reference {{for changes in the}} developmental program. The distribution of <b>auxin</b> depends on both <b>auxin</b> metabolism (biosynthesis, conjugation and degradation) and cellular <b>auxin</b> transport. We identified in silico a novel putative <b>auxin</b> transport facilitator family, called PIN-LIKES (PILS). Here we illustrate that PILS proteins are required for auxin-dependent regulation of plant growth by determining the cellular sensitivity to <b>auxin.</b> PILS proteins regulate intracellular <b>auxin</b> accumulation at the endoplasmic reticulum and thus <b>auxin</b> availability for nuclear <b>auxin</b> signalling. PILS activity affects the level of endogenous <b>auxin</b> indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA), presumably via intracellular accumulation and metabolism. Our findings reveal that the transport machinery to compartmentalize <b>auxin</b> within the cell is of an unexpected molecular complexity and demonstrate this compartmentalization to be functionally important for a number of developmental processes...|$|R
40|$|<b>Auxin</b> plays a {{major role}} in a variety of {{processes}} involved in plant developmental patterning and its adaptation to environmental conditions. Therefore, an important question is how specificity in <b>auxin</b> signalling is achieved, that is, how a single signalling molecule can carry so many different types of information. In recent years, many studies on <b>auxin</b> specificity have been published, unravelling increasingly more details on differential <b>auxin</b> sensitivity, expression domains and downstream partners of the <b>auxin</b> receptors (transport inhibitor response 1 (TIR 1) and other <b>auxin</b> signaling F-box proteins (AFB)), transcriptional repressors that are degraded in response to <b>auxin</b> (AUX/IAA) and downstream <b>auxin</b> response factors (ARF) that together constitute the plant’s major <b>auxin</b> response pathways. These data are critical to explain how, in the same cells, different <b>auxin</b> levels may trigger different responses, as well as how in different spatial or temporal contexts similar <b>auxin</b> signals converge to different responses. However, these insights do not yet answer more complex questions regarding <b>auxin</b> specificity. As an example, they leave open the question of how similar sized <b>auxin</b> changes at similar locations result in different responses depending on the duration and spatial extent of the fluctuation in <b>auxin</b> levels. Similarly, it leaves unanswered how, in the case of certain tropisms, small differences in signal strength at both sides of a plant organ are converted into an instructive <b>auxin</b> asymmetry that enables a robust tropic response. Finally, it does not explain how, in certain cases, substantially different <b>auxin</b> levels become translated into similar cellular responses, while in other cases similar <b>auxin</b> levels, even when combined with similar <b>auxin</b> response machinery, may trigger different responses. In this review, we illustrate how considering the regulatory networks and contexts in which <b>auxin</b> signalling takes place helps answer these types of fundamental questions...|$|R
25|$|Depending on the {{specific}} tissue, auxin may promote axial elongation (as in shoots), lateral expansion (as in root swelling), or isodiametric expansion (as in fruit growth). In some cases (coleoptile growth), auxin-promoted cellular expansion occurs {{in the absence of}} cell division. In other cases, auxin-promoted cell division and cell expansion may be closely sequenced within the same tissue (root initiation, fruit growth). In a living plant, <b>auxins</b> and other plant hormones nearly always appear to interact to determine patterns of plant development.|$|E
25|$|Cytokinins or CKs are a {{group of}} {{chemicals}} that influence cell division and shoot formation. They were called kinins {{in the past when}} the first cytokinins were isolated from yeast cells. They also help delay senescence of tissues, are responsible for mediating auxin transport throughout the plant, and affect internodal length and leaf growth. Cytokinins and <b>auxins</b> often work together, and the ratios of these two groups of plant hormones affect most major growth periods during a plant's lifetime. Cytokinins counter the apical dominance induced by auxins; they in conjunction with ethylene promote abscission of leaves, flower parts, and fruits.|$|E
25|$|On the {{molecular}} level, all <b>auxins</b> are compounds with an aromatic ring and a carboxylic acid group. The most important {{member of the}} auxin family is indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which generates the majority of auxin effects in intact plants, and is the most potent native auxin. And as native auxin, its stability is controlled in many ways in plants, from synthesis, through possible conjugation to degradation of its molecules, always {{according to the requirements}} of the situation. However, molecules of IAA are chemically labile in aqueous solution, so it is not used commercially as a plant growth regulator.|$|E
40|$|<b>Auxin</b> steers {{numerous}} physiological {{processes in}} plants making the tight {{control of its}} endogenous levels and spatiotemporal distribution a necessity. This regulation is achieved by different mechanisms including <b>auxin</b> biosynthesis, metabolic conversions, degradation and transport. Here we introduce cis-cinnamic acid (c-CA) as a novel and unique addition to {{a small group of}} endogenous molecules affecting in planta <b>auxin</b> concentrations. c-CA is the photo-isomerization product of the phenylpropanoid pathway intermediate trans-CA (t-CA). When grown on c-CA-containing medium, an evolutionary diverse set of plant species where shown to exhibit phenotypes characteristic for high <b>auxin</b> levels, including inhibition of primary root growth, induction of root hairs, and promotion of adventitious and lateral rooting. By molecular docking and receptor binding assays, we showed that c-CA itself is neither an <b>auxin,</b> nor an anti-auxin, and <b>auxin</b> profiling data revealed that c-CA does not significantly interfere with <b>auxin</b> biosynthesis. Single-cell-based <b>auxin</b> accumulation assays showed that c-CA, and not t-CA, is a potent inhibitor of <b>auxin</b> efflux. <b>Auxin</b> signaling reporters detected changes in spatiotemporal distribution of the <b>auxin</b> response along the root of c-CA-treated plants, and long distance <b>auxin</b> transport assays showed no inhibition of rootward <b>auxin</b> transport. Overall, these results suggest that the phenotypes of c-CA-treated plants are the consequence of a local change in <b>auxin</b> accumulation, induced by the inhibition of <b>auxin</b> efflux transport. This work reveals a novel mechanism how plants may regulate <b>auxin</b> levels and adds a novel, naturally occurring molecule to the chemical toolbox for the studies of <b>auxin</b> homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|The Arabidopsis hypocotyl, {{together}} with hormone mutants and chemical inhibitors, {{was used to}} study the role of <b>auxin</b> in cell elongation and its possible interactions with ethylene and gibberellin. When wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings were grown on media containing a range of <b>auxin</b> concentrations, hypocotyl growth was inhibited. However, when axr 1 - 12 and 35 S-iaaL (which have reduced <b>auxin</b> response and levels, respectively) were grown in the same conditions, <b>auxin</b> was able to promote hypocotyl growth. In contrast, <b>auxin</b> does not promote hypocotyl growth of axr 3 - 1, which has phenotypes that suggest an enhanced <b>auxin</b> response. These {{results are consistent with}} the hypothesis that <b>auxin</b> levels in the wild-type hypocotyl are optimal for elongation and that additional <b>auxin</b> is inhibitory. When ethylene responses were reduced using either the ethylene-resistant mutant etr 1 or aminoethoxyvinylglycine, an inhibitor of ethylene synthesis, <b>auxin</b> responses were unchanged, indicating that <b>auxin</b> does not inhibit hypocotyl elongation through ethylene. To test for interactions between <b>auxin</b> and gibberellin, <b>auxin</b> mutants were grown on media containing gibberellin and gibberellin mutants were grown on media containing <b>auxin.</b> The responses were found to be the same as wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings in all cases. In addition, 1 microM of the <b>auxin</b> transport inhibitor 1 -naphthylphthalmic acid does not alter the response of wild-type seedlings to gibberellin. Double mutants were made between gibberellin and <b>auxin</b> mutants and the phenotypes of these appear additive. These results indicate that <b>auxin</b> and gibberellin are acting independently in hypocotyl elongation. Thus <b>auxin,</b> ethylene, and gibberellin each regulate hypocotyl elongation independently...|$|R
40|$|In plants, each {{developmental}} process integrates {{a network}} of signaling events that are regulated by different phytohormones, and interactions among hormonal pathways are essential to modulate their effect. Continuous growth of roots results from the postembryonic activity of cells within the root meristem that {{is controlled by the}} coordinated action of several phytohormones, including <b>auxin</b> and ethylene. Although their interaction has been studied intensively, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this interplay are unknown. We show that the effect of ethylene on root growth is largely mediated by the regulation of the <b>auxin</b> biosynthesis and transport-dependent local <b>auxin</b> distribution. Ethylene stimulates <b>auxin</b> biosynthesis and basipetal <b>auxin</b> transport toward the elongation zone, where it activates a local <b>auxin</b> response leading to inhibition of cell elongation. Consistently, in mutants affected in <b>auxin</b> perception or basipetal <b>auxin</b> transport, ethylene cannot activate the <b>auxin</b> response nor regulate the root growth. In addition, ethylene modulates the transcription of several components of the <b>auxin</b> transport machinery. Thus, ethylene achieves a local activation of the <b>auxin</b> signaling pathway and regulates root growth by both stimulating the <b>auxin</b> biosynthesis and by modulating the <b>auxin</b> transport machinery...|$|R
25|$|Ethylene is biosynthesized {{from the}} amino acid {{methionine}} to S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM, also called Adomet) by the enzyme Met Adenosyltransferase. SAM is then converted to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) by the enzyme ACC synthase (ACS). The activity of ACS determines {{the rate of}} ethylene production, therefore regulation of this enzyme is key for the ethylene biosynthesis. The final step requires oxygen and involves {{the action of the}} enzyme ACC-oxidase (ACO), formerly known as the ethylene forming enzyme (EFE). Ethylene biosynthesis can be induced by endogenous or exogenous ethylene. ACC synthesis increases with high levels of <b>auxins,</b> especially indole acetic acid (IAA) and cytokinins.|$|E
25|$|The (dynamic and {{environment}} responsive) pattern of auxin distribution within {{the plant is}} a key factor for plant growth, its reaction to its environment, and specifically for development of plant organs (such as leaves or flowers). It is achieved through very complex and well coordinated active transport of auxin molecules from cell to cell throughout the plant body — by the so-called polar auxin transport. Thus, a plant can (as a whole) react to external conditions and adjust to them, without requiring a nervous system. <b>Auxins</b> typically act in concert with, or in opposition to, other plant hormones. For example, the ratio of auxin to cytokinin in certain plant tissues determines initiation of root versus shoot buds.|$|E

40|$|<b>Auxin</b> (IAA) is {{versatile}} signalling molecule of plants, currently {{classified as}} plant hormone. But there are data suggesting that <b>auxin</b> is acting also as plant-specific morphogen, electric-responses inducing transmitter, and as general signalling molecule used for plant-bacteria communication. Our previous data revealed that <b>auxin</b> {{is associated with}} secretory endosomes and also highly enriched within cell walls of cells active in transcellular <b>auxin</b> transport. Our present data, based on in vivo non-invasive <b>auxin</b> flux recordings, reveal that <b>auxin</b> is secreted out of synaptic-like domains specialized for efflux of <b>auxin</b> in root apex cells highly active in polar cell-cell transport of <b>auxin.</b> We obtained both genetic and pharmacological evidence that phospholipase Dζ 2 drives vesicular secretion of <b>auxin</b> for its polar transcellular transport in the transition zone of the root apex.

40|$|Carrier-dependent, {{intercellular}} <b>auxin</b> transport {{is central}} to the developmental patterning of higher plants (tracheophytes). The evolution of this polar <b>auxin</b> transport might be linked to the translocation of some PIN <b>auxin</b> efflux carriers from their presumably ancestral localization at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the polar domains at the plasma membrane. Here we propose an eventually ancient mechanism of intercellular <b>auxin</b> distribution by ER-localized <b>auxin</b> transporters involving intracellular <b>auxin</b> retention and switch-like release from the ER.

40|$|Long-distance <b>auxin</b> {{transport}} {{was examined}} in Medicago truncatula {{and in its}} supernodulating mutant sunn (super numeric nodules) to investigate the regulation of <b>auxin</b> transport during autoregulation of nodulation (AON). A method was developed to monitor the transport of <b>auxin</b> from the shoot to the root in whole seedlings. Subsequently, the transport was monitored after inoculation of roots with the nodulating symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti. The sunn mutant showed an increased amount of <b>auxin</b> transported from the shoot to the root compared to the wild type. The <b>auxin</b> transport capacity of excised root segments was similar in wild type and sunn, suggesting that the difference in long-distance <b>auxin</b> transfer between them is due to loading in the shoot. After inoculation, wild-type seedlings showed decreased <b>auxin</b> loading from the shoot to the root; however, the sunn mutant failed {{to reduce the amount}} of <b>auxin</b> loaded. The time of reduced <b>auxin</b> loading correlated with the onset of AON.

Inoculation of sunn failed to reduce the level of <b>auxin</b> within 24 h, as was observed in the wild type. We propose a model for the role of <b>auxin</b> during AON of indeterminate legumes: 1) high levels of endogenous <b>auxin</b> are correlated with increased numbers of nodules, 2) inoculation of roots reduces <b>auxin</b> loading from the shoot to the root, and 3) subsequent reduction of <b>auxin</b> levels in the root inhibits further nodule initiation...|$|R
