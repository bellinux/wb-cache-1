The <b>Athens</b> Symphony Orchestra {{was founded in}} 1978 as a firmly non-profit, strictly volunteer organization, conducted by Albert Ligotti of the University of Georgia. The first performance came in 1979; the Orchestra now has two regular performances, one {{in the summer and}} one in the winter, and has also done shows for young people, pops concerts and Christmas concerts. In 1996, the <b>Athens</b> Symphony moved into its modern home, the Classic Center Theatre in downtown <b>Athens.</b>|$|E
5|$|Otto's early reign {{was also}} notable for his moving {{the capital of}} Greece from Nafplion to <b>Athens.</b> His first task as king {{was to make a}} {{detailed}} archaeological and topographic survey of <b>Athens.</b> He assigned Gustav Eduard Schaubert and Stamatios Kleanthis to complete this task. At that time, <b>Athens</b> had a population of roughly 4,000–5,000 people, located mainly in what today covers the district of Plaka in <b>Athens.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, an Athenian runner named Pheidippides {{was sent}} to run from <b>Athens</b> to Sparta to ask for {{assistance}} before the battle. He ran a distance of over 225 kilometers (140 miles), arriving in Sparta {{the day after he}} left. Then, following the battle, the Athenian army marched the 40 kilometers (25 miles) or so back to <b>Athens</b> at a very high pace (considering the quantity of armour, and the fatigue after the battle), in order to head off the Persian force sailing around Cape Sounion. They arrived back in the late afternoon, {{in time to see the}} Persian ships turn away from <b>Athens,</b> thus completing the Athenian victory.|$|E

5|$|After the {{completion}} of his doctorate, Tsakalotos entered into an academic career. His first role was as a {{research associate at the}} University of Kent, from 1989 to 1990. From October 1990 to June 1993, he taught at the university as a lecturer. In 1993, Tsakalotos and his wife moved to Greece, and in October 1994 he began teaching at the <b>Athens</b> University of Economics and Business. In September 2010, he became a full professor of economics at the National and Kapodistrian University of <b>Athens,</b> more commonly referred to simply as the University of <b>Athens.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alcibiades {{served as}} a {{military}} adviser to Sparta and helped the Spartans secure several crucial successes. He advised them to build a permanent fort at Decelea, just over ten miles (16km) from <b>Athens</b> and {{within sight of the}} city. By doing this, the Spartans cut the Athenians off entirely from their homes and crops and the silver mines of Sunium. This was part of Alcibiades's plan to renew the war with <b>Athens</b> in Attica. The move was devastating to <b>Athens</b> and forced the citizens to live within the long walls of the city year round, making them entirely dependent on their seaborne trade for food. Seeing <b>Athens</b> thus beleaguered on a second front, members of the Delian League began to contemplate revolt. In the wake of Athens's disastrous defeat in Sicily, Alcibiades sailed to Ionia with a Spartan fleet and succeeded in persuading several critical cities to revolt.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as the}} Persian {{survivors}} had put to sea, the Athenians marched {{as quickly}} as possible to <b>Athens.</b> They arrived in time to prevent Artaphernes from securing a landing in <b>Athens.</b> Seeing his opportunity lost, Artaphernes ended the year's campaign and returned to Asia.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, <b>Athens</b> orchestrated the {{creation}} of an alliance with Euboea, Megara, Achaea, Corinth, Acarnania and other states in the Peloponnese. However the most desirable ally for <b>Athens</b> was Thebes. To secure their allegiance, Demosthenes was sent, by <b>Athens,</b> to the Boeotian city; Philip also sent a deputation, but Demosthenes succeeded in securing Thebes's allegiance.* K. Tsatsos, Demosthenes, 284–285; H. Weil, Biography of Demosthenes, 41–42. Demosthenes' oration before the Theban people is not extant and, therefore, the arguments he used to convince the Thebans remain unknown. In any case, the alliance came at a price: Thebes's control of Boeotia was recognised, Thebes was to command solely on land and jointly at sea, and <b>Athens</b> was to pay two thirds of the campaign's cost.|$|E
5|$|<b>Athens</b> {{is home to}} {{the summer}} music festival Athfest, , the <b>Athens</b> Popfest and the late spring <b>Athens</b> Human Rights Festival and North Georgia Folk Festival. The college radio station WUOG (90.5 FM), the {{low-power}} (100.7) FM WPPP-LP and the free weekly Flagpole are the city's most prominent modern music media. <b>Athens</b> has never produced a major local label like many similar indie rock towns; the most important label of the 1970s and 1980s was DB Records, based out of Atlanta, though jangle pop pioneers Kindercore Records and Wuxtry Records were also Athens-based.|$|E
5|$|<b>Athens</b> {{was chosen}} as the Greek capital for {{historical}} and sentimental reasons, not because it was a large city. At the time, it was a town consisting of only 400 houses {{at the foot of the}} Acropolis. A modern city plan was laid out, and public buildings erected. The finest legacy of this period are the buildings of the University of <b>Athens</b> (1837, under the name Othonian University), the <b>Athens</b> Polytechnic University (1837, under the name Royal School of Arts), the National Gardens of <b>Athens</b> (1840), the National Library of Greece (1842), the Old Royal Palace (now the Greek Parliament Building, 1843), and the Old Parliament Building (1858). Schools and hospitals were established all over the (still small) Greek dominion, Due to the negative feelings of the Greek people toward non-Greek rule, historical attention to this aspect of his reign has been neglected.|$|E

5|$|Cleomenes was {{not pleased}} with events, and marched on <b>Athens</b> with the Spartan army. Cleomenes's {{attempts}} to restore Isagoras to <b>Athens</b> ended in a debacle, but fearing the worst, the Athenians had by this point already sent an embassy to Artaphernes in Sardis, to request aid from the Persian empire. Artaphernes requested that the Athenians give him an 'earth and water', a traditional token of submission, to which the Athenian ambassadors acquiesced. They were, however, severely censured for this {{when they returned to}} <b>Athens.</b> At some later point Cleomenes instigated a plot to restore Hippias to the rule of <b>Athens.</b> This failed and Hippias again fled to Sardis and tried to persuade the Persians to subjugate <b>Athens.</b> The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to Artaphernes to dissuade him from taking action, but Artaphernes merely instructed the Athenians to take Hippias back as tyrant. The Athenians indignantly declined, and instead resolved to open war with Persia. Having thus become the enemy of Persia, <b>Athens</b> was already in a position to support the Ionian cities when they began their revolt. The fact that the Ionian democracies were inspired by the example the Athenians had set no doubt further persuaded the Athenians to support the Ionian Revolt, especially since the cities of Ionia were originally Athenian colonies.|$|E
