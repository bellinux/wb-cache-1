25|$|For {{many years}} after the 1986 Chernobyl {{disaster}} nuclear power was off the policy agenda in most countries. In recent years, intense public relations activities by the nuclear industry, increasing evidence of climate change and failures to address it, have brought nuclear power issues back {{to the forefront of}} policy discussion in the nuclear renaissance countries. But some countries <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> expand nuclear power and are still divesting themselves of their nuclear legacy, through nuclear power phase-out legislation.|$|E
25|$|In many {{countries}} the traditional divisions between barristers and solicitors are breaking down. Barristers once enjoyed {{a monopoly on}} appearances before the higher courts, but in Great Britain this has now been abolished, and solicitor advocates can generally appear for clients at trial. Increasingly, firms of solicitors are keeping even the most advanced advisory and litigation work in-house for economic and client relationship reasons. Similarly, the prohibition on barristers taking instructions directly from the public has also been widely abolished. But, in practice, direct instruction is still a rarity in most jurisdictions, partly because barristers with narrow specializations, or who are only really trained for advocacy, <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> provide general advice {{to members of the}} public.|$|E

25|$|Irish Terriers {{are good}} with people. They have a highly {{developed}} sense of loyalty {{and it is}} important that they have a strong responsible leader, for whom they have natural respect. Most Irish Terriers love children and tolerate rough-housing to a certain extent. Irish terriers need exercise; do not get one if you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> walk it. They enjoy training, new tasks are easily mastered with food and toys working equally well as motivation. Irish terriers have less of an eagerness to please people than some other breeds but have mental ability and enjoy puzzle solving. They respond best to consistent, reward based training from a relaxed, authoritative person. As with all dog breeds, violence should never be used – instead use distraction and reward the behaviour you want. It is always best to outwit and lure. When seeking a trainer, one should look for a person who has experience with terriers.|$|E
500|$|In 1890 at the {{formation}} of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), Stanton was elected president. She left such duties to Susan B. Anthony and instead traveled to Europe for two years. While there she met with women who shared her views, and she gathered critical observations about the place of woman in the Bible. In Greenbank, Bristol, Stanton met with English suffragist Helen Bright Clark, and spoke to a group about the Bible position of woman. Clark questioned whether Stanton's liberal views had shocked some in attendance, and Stanton replied: [...] "Well, if we who do see the absurdities of the old superstitions never unveil them to others, how is the world to make any progress in the theologies? I am in the sunset of life, and I feel it to be my special mission to tell people what they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> hear..." ...|$|E
500|$|Sands' {{election}} victory raised {{hopes that}} a settlement could be negotiated, but Thatcher stood firm in refusing to give {{concessions to the}} hunger strikers. She stated [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> consider special category status for certain groups of people serving sentences for crime. Crime is crime is crime, it is not political". The world's media descended on Belfast, and several intermediaries visited Sands {{in an attempt to}} negotiate an end to the hunger strike, including Síle de Valera, granddaughter of Éamon de Valera, Pope John Paul II's personal envoy John Magee, and European Commission of Human Rights officials. With Sands close to death, the government's position remained unchanged, with Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Humphrey Atkins stating [...] "If Mr. Sands persisted in his wish to commit suicide, that was his choice. The Government would not force medical treatment upon him".|$|E

500|$|In June 2006, McEvilly {{was set to}} join for Bradford City on a free {{transfer}} after agreeing {{a contract}} with the club. Despite McEvilly passing a medical, the move fell through as he was unwilling to train with Bradford during their pre-season without guarantee of a contract. Bradford City manager Colin Todd explained; [...] "We were concerned about an old injury to his foot which has resulted in it being pinned and we <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> take a risk with him". McEvilly opted to sign a new two-year contract with Wrexham. During pre-season with Wrexham, McEvilly broke his other foot, having previously broke the same bone twice in four-months during the previous season. His first appearance of the 2006–07 season, was on 25 November at home against Lincoln City in the 2–1 win in League Two, when he came on as a substitute for Kevin Smith in the 80th minute. McEvilly went on to make 28 appearances in League Two, scoring eight goals and a further two appearances in the FA Cup, scoring once against Championship side Derby County in their 3–1 defeat at Pride Park on 6 January. His contract was cancelled by mutual consent {{at the end of the}} season. Wrexham manager Brian Carey said that they are [...] "well covered in terms of strikers" [...] and [...] "he is some way down the pecking order".|$|E
500|$|In South Africa, Vorster {{heard that}} D'Oliveira {{had been added}} to the team shortly before {{addressing}} the Orange Free State National Party congress at Bloemfontein on 17 September. He immediately announced that the English team would not be allowed into South Africa if it included D'Oliveira. He told the gathering that while [...] "we are and always have been prepared to play host to the MCC... <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> receive a team thrust upon us by people whose interests are not the game, but to gain certain political objectives which they do not even attempt to hide". To loud applause, he went on to describe the revised MCC team as [...] "not the team of the MCC but the team of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, the team of SANROC [...] and the team of Bishop Reeves [...]" [...] Vorster expressed similar sentiments elsewhere, accusing the MCC of making a purely political decision. He insisted that he [...] "had taken a decision for South Africa". The South African press was mostly critical of Vorster, warning that his stand might lead to the country's exclusion from international sport, but Professor Bruce Murray comments that the MCC's initial exclusion of D'Oliveira, only to then include him instead of a bowler, had given Vorster some ammunition to claim that the MCC selection was politically charged. Including D'Oliveira from the start would, by contrast, have forced Vorster to reveal that his plan to allow mixed teams was false.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the church}} began to collide and meld with {{cultures}} outside of Utah and the United States, the church began to jettison {{some of the}} parochialisms and prejudices that had become part of Latter-day Saint culture, but were not essential to Mormonism. In 1971, LDS General Authority and scholar Bruce R. McConkie drew parallels between the LDS Church and the New Testament church, who had difficulty embracing the Gentiles within Christianity, and encouraged members {{not to be so}} indoctrinated with social customs that they fail to engage other cultures in Mormonism. Other peoples, he stated, [...] "have a different background than we have, which is of no moment to the Lord.... It is no different to have different social customs than it is to have different languages.... And the Lord knows all languages". In 1987, Boyd K. Packer, another Latter-day Saint Apostle, stated, [...] "We can't move [...] with a 1947 Utah Church! Could it be that we <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> take the gospel because we <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> take (and they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> receive) all of the things we have wrapped up with it as extra baggage?" [...] During and after the Civil Rights Movement, the church faced a critical point in its history, where its previous attitudes toward other cultures and people of color, which had once been shared by much of the white American mainstream, began to appear racist and neocolonial. The church came under intense fire for its stances on blacks and Native Americans issues.|$|E

2500|$|On March 2, 2008 Hill {{said in an}} {{interview}} in Beijing that US diplomatic relations with Korea were possible before the end of the Bush administration if Korea completely dismantled its nuclear program. [...] "We've told them we <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> do that until they give up their nuclear materials", said Hill. [...] "We can begin the process of discussing what we are going to do, whether we are going to open embassies, that sort of thing. But we will not have diplomatic relations with a nuclear North Korea." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a letter}} to Churchill written that night, Robert Boothby {{asserted}} that parliamentary opinion was hardening against Halifax, claiming in a postscript that according to Clement Davies, [...] "Attlee & Greenwood are unable {{to distinguish between the}} PM & Halifax and <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> serve under the latter." [...] Davies (who thought Chamberlain should go, and be replaced by Churchill) had lunched with Attlee and Greenwood (and argued his case) shortly before they saw Chamberlain. However, Hugh Dalton noted in his diary entry for 9 May that he had talked to Attlee, who [...] "agrees with my preference for Halifax over Churchill, but we both think either would be tolerable." ...|$|E

[...] Left-wing Israeli {{commentator}} and former Minister of Justice Yossi Beilin also said in January 2009 that [...] "Hamas considers its adherence to the three [...] "nos" [...] of Khartoum from 1967, which the entire Arab world abandoned in adopting the Arab peace initiative, to be its primary distinctive feature Fateh. Even a prolonged battering by the IDF will not bring Hamas to make this change." [...] The Khaleej Times editorialized in December 2008 that [...] "The Arab peace plan remains the best and most pragmatic solution to Palestine-Israel conflict.... Even though Hamas and Islamic Jihad <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> accept anything short of the entire Palestine occupied in 1940s, if the plan is accepted by Israel and US, the Arabs could possibly persuade Islamists to embrace it too." ...|$|E
2500|$|Due to South African {{apartheid}} laws, which introduced legal {{racial segregation}} {{to the country}} in 1948, no non-white (defined under the legislation as either [...] "black", [...] "coloured" [...] or [...] "Indian") player was eligible to play Test cricket for South Africa. [...] In fact, overseas teams wishing to tour South Africa were also limited by these rules. [...] These laws led to Basil D'Oliveira, a 'Cape Coloured' South African emigrating to England, where he began to play Test cricket. [...] He was subsequently named as a late replacement {{as part of the}} England team to tour South African in 1968–69, but South African Prime Minister John Vorster refused to allow D'Oliveira into the country as part of the touring side, declaring: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> receive a team thrust upon us by people whose interests are not in the game but to gain certain political objectives which they do not even attempt to hide. The MCC team is not the team of the MCC but of the anti-apartheid movement." [...] A week later, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) called off the tour. [...] South Africa's cricket team toured Australia the following winter, but a tour of England in 1970, and of Australia in 1971–72 were both cancelled after anti-apartheid protests. [...] Despite this growing sporting isolation, a New Zealand women's team toured South Africa in the 1971–72 season. [...] Only three members of the 1960 South Africa team returned to compete against New Zealand: Jennifer Gove, Lorna Ward and Maureen Payne. [...] New Zealand played six tour matches and three Test matches in a tour lasting just over a month spanning February and March 1972. [...] New Zealand won the series 1–0, with both the first and the last Tests being drawn.|$|E
