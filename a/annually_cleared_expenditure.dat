40|$|Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) are a {{critically}} important prey species for Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis). Determination of snowshoe hare distribution and abundance {{is needed in}} western Wyoming for lynx conservation. We used linear regression to examine the correlations between snowshoe hare density, as determined by mark-recapture estimates, and fecal pellet plot counts on both uncleared and <b>annually</b> <b>cleared</b> plots on the Bridger-Teton National Forest, western Wyoming. We found significant correlations between hare density estimates and fecal pellet counts for both uncleared and <b>annually</b> <b>cleared</b> pellet counts; however the relationship was much stronger for <b>annually</b> <b>cleared</b> pellet counts. Adjusting the buffer size by omitting hard habitat edges (not used by hares) around the trapping grids improved correlations between hare density and fecal pellet counts further. We recommend pellet counts from <b>annually</b> <b>cleared</b> plots be used when precise estimates of snowshoe hare abundance are required. Though precision is sacrificed when using uncleared plots, they are useful as a coarse index of habitat use by hares. The derived regression equations {{should be used to}} identify foraging habitat for lynx in western Wyoming. In addition to snowshoe hares, in western Wyoming red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and grouse (Bonasa umbellus and Dendragapus obscurus) are used by Canada lynx. Whether young forests or older multi-storied forests contain more snowshoe hares, red squirrels, and grouse in western Wyoming is currently unknown. We estimated snowshoe hare density, and indexed red squirrel and forest grouse abundance in 3 classes of 30 - 70 -year-old lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and 4 classes of mature multi-storied forest with a spruce (Picea engelmannii) -fir (Abies lasiocarpa) component. We recorded landscape and forest structure characteristics to understand how these influence lynx prey abundance. Overall, snowshoe hares, red squirrels, and forest grouse were more abundant in multi-storied forests than young forests. Forest attributes that predicted prey abundance were often more prevalent in multi-storied forests. Results from this study suggest that multi-storied forests with a spruce-fir component were disproportionately important to snowshoe hares, red squirrels, and forest grouse in western Wyoming. Canada lynx conservation efforts should focus on maintaining, enhancing, and promoting multi-storied forests in this region...|$|R

40|$|Farm waste {{stores are}} {{widespread}} in the UK, with many overlying the principal aquifer, the Chalk. The stores {{pose a threat to}} groundwater quality through the infiltration of high concentrations of nitrogen species and organic carbon together with pathogenic microbes. Two cored boreholes have been drilled into the unsaturated chalk to depths of 15 and 20 metres, respectively, through a site which has been used to store turkey litter for in excess of 20 years. Porewaters were extracted from the cores and analysed for a range of chemical elements. In addition, chalk core material was also taken for microbial examination. Both boreholes showed very high concentrations of nitrate-N (3000 mg/L), ammonia (5000 mg/L), organic carbon (3000 mg/L), and potassium (10, 000 mg/L) in the top 5 metres of the profile. Below this depth concentrations declined dramatically. Highest concentrations were found in the borehole constructed {{in the middle of the}} site. The borehole constructed at the edge of the store showed much lower concentrations but did show a peak of nitrate around 10 metres below ground level.

In response South Africa has had a strong focus on employing seed reducing biological control agents to deal with Australian Acacia invasion, a programme that is considered as being successful. To provide a predictive understanding for their management, seed banks of four invasive Australian acacia species (Acacia longifolia, A. mearnsii, A. pycnantha and A. saligna) were studied in the Western Cape of South Africa. Across six to seven sites for each species, seed bank sizes were estimated from dense, monospecific stands by collecting 30 litter and soil samples.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} role of the {{government}} in Pakistan's agriculture sector and concludes that major reforms are needed. The government's role is grouped into two main areas: price and trade policy, and public institutions, services, and expenditures. First, the paper assesses the impact of the price and trade policy on incentives and the functioning of input markets. Agricultural incentives have been severely distorted by policy, both through direct effects on agricultural prices and indirect effects operating through the exchange rate. Although indirect effects from the exchange rate have been corrected, some indirect effects remain because of higher protection given to industry. Subsidies on the input side have created distortions in input markets, dissipating much of the subsidy and its intended benefit to small farmers. Second, the paper looks at {{the role of}} public institutions. These have proliferated into almost every area of agriculture, with very little benefit to the sector. The most notable failure has been in the area of research and extension. Public enterprises have crowded out the private sector in marketing and distribution, and the rationale for government presence in these areas is not <b>clear.</b> Hidden <b>expenditure</b> also has taken place through underpricing of water and electricity, making the continued provision of these inputs financially unsustainable. The paper concludes that the role of government in agriculture has had little beneficial impact for most farmers and, therefore, major reforms are needed in policy and institutions to help sectoral growth. ...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore and establish if the implementation of section 100 (1) (b) Constitutional intervention assisted LPT to resolve the financial disparities that plagued the Province of Limpopo. Literature survey concurs that any institution failing to perform its legislative mandate should be put under Constitutional intervention to restore best practices. The study adopted qualitative research design however, elements of quantitative research design, to a smaller extent, have been applied in the study to collect and analyse the data. Case study design was adopted with LPT as the case for the study. The study revealed that section 100 Constitutional intervention did not achieve its objectives of <b>clearing</b> unauthorised <b>expenditure</b> of R 2, 7 billion but LPT has immensely benefited from the Constitutional intervention process due to strong controls built, important projects implemented such as Project Based Learning (PBL) and being pilot for various projects such as LOGIS roll-out.
