40|$|We have cloned {{fragments}} of the Klebsiella pneumoniae genome that carry part of the his operon {{and part of the}} nitrogen fixation (nif) gene cluster on the <b>amplifiable</b> <b>plasmid</b> pMB 9. One particular plasmid, pCRA 37, complements mutations in the hisD, nifB, and nifF loci. The physical map of pCRA 37 as determined by restriction enzyme analysis correlates with the genetic map of the his-nif region as determined previously by phage P 1 -mediated cotransductional analysis...|$|E
40|$|Colicin N was {{identified}} as the 39, 000 -molecular-weight protein encoded by the 4, 900 -base-pair, multiple copy number, <b>amplifiable</b> <b>plasmid</b> ColN - 284. Its production was controlled by the SOS regulatory circuit and by catabolite repression. Colicin accumulated intracellularly to ca. 10 (6) molecules per cell after growth for 2 to 3 h in medium containing 0. 5 microgram of mitomycin C per ml and was then released as the cells underwent partial lysis. Strains carrying pColN - 284 and its derivatives exhibited low-level immunity to colicin N and were fully sensitive to all other colicins tested. Regions of the plasmid responsible for colicin N activity (cna), for mitomycin-induced lysis (cnl), and for colicin N immunity (cni) were localized and characterized by cloning, transposon Tn 5 and hydroxylamine mutagenesis, and restriction endonuclease deletion and mapping analysis. The results are {{discussed in terms of}} both the organization of the cna, cnl, and cni genes and the respective role of cnl expression and colicin N production in mitomycin sensitivity, colicin export, and induced partial lysis of ColN + cells...|$|E
40|$|PHAGE MU is a {{temperate}} virus of Escherichia coli (for reviews see refs 1, 2). The immunity {{system of}} Mu {{has been shown}} by genetic and physical mapping to lie in the furthest left, 1, 000 -base-pair restriction fragment of the phage DNA 3 â€“ 6. This end of the phage genome {{is associated with a}} short (100 -base pair) segment of bacterial DNA 4. The HindIII-c restriction fragment of Mu (the furthest left 1, 000 base pairs 4) has been cloned into the <b>amplifiable</b> <b>plasmid</b> pMB 9 (ref. 7). These recombinant plasmids confer high levels of Mu immunity on their hosts and, when recloned into minicell-producing strains, were shown to produce an additional protein of 25, 000 subunit molecular weight in purified minicells 6, 7. This protein is assumed to be the Mu repressor because its production is correlated with immunity to Mu. We report here experiments which show that this protein binds specifically and with high affinity to Mu DNA, as would be expected of the Mu repressor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the DNA sequence (operator) to which the Mu repressor binds is located on the same HindIII-c restriction fragment of Mu DNA as the repressor gene...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} the rapid determination of the physical location of mutations caused by insertion of transposable elements. We used this method to construct a detailed physical map of the nitrogen fixation (nif) gene cluster of Klebsiella pneumoniae and to correlate it with the genetic map. Total cellular DNA was isolated from individual strains, each carrying an insertion in 1 of 15 different nif genes. The DNA was digested with a restriction endonuclease, fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, denatured, and blotted onto nitrocellulose filter paper. The DNA on the filters was hybridized with 32 P-labeled DNA fragments derived from <b>amplifiable</b> <b>plasmids</b> carrying cloned nif DNA fragments from K. pneumoniae. Altered hybridization patterns caused by insertions into nif genes allowed us to map nif mutations {{with respect to the}} previously mapped cleavage sites for various restriction endonucleases. We have used the same method to map the end points of nif deletions. Using this procedure, we assigned physical locations on the K. pneumoniae chromosome to 86 nif insertion mutations and 13 nif deletion end points. This mapping procedure provides a convenient alternative to deletion mapping as a definitive method for mapping insertion mutations within a gene or for ordering genes within a gene cluster. This procedure will be especially useful for mapping mutations conferring phenotypes that are difficult to monitor and for mapping mutations in bacterial species in which techniques for conducting deletion mapping have not been devised...|$|R
40|$|The {{locations}} of the fertility inhibition genes finO and finP of the F-like conjugative multiple antibiotic-resistance plasmid R 6 - 5 have been determined. As found previously for that of the fertility plasmid F, the finP gene of R 6 - 5 is located close to the origin of DNA transfer, oriT, and to the promoter-proximal segment of the tra operon. Thus, finP {{is close to the}} site of action of the FinOP fertility inhibition system. In contrast, the finO gene is located {{on the other side of}} the tra operon, greater than 35 kilobases from the finP gene; finO is very close to the origin of vegetative replication, oriV, and to cistrons encoding functions involved in autonomous plasmid replication and plasmid incompatibility. A 4. 5 -kilobase fragment of R 6 - 5 DNA containing the finO gene has been cloned on the high-copy <b>amplifiable</b> vector <b>plasmid</b> pBR 322. This hybrid plasmid, designated pKTO 31, causes severe repression of conjugal transfer of plasmid F, indicating the production of high cellular levels of finO protein. Two independent finO mutant derivatives were obtained after mutagenesis of the pKTO 31 plasmid. Comparison of proteins synthesized by minicells carrying finO- mutant plasmids with those carrying various finO+ plasmids enables the finO gene product to be tentatively identified as a 22, 000 -dalton protein...|$|R
40|$|Equine herpesvirus- 1 (EHV- 1) {{infection}} is of significant animal welfare and economic importance. Yet, no standardised molecular techniques {{are available for}} diagnosis or confirmation of viral infection. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a standardised and quantitative assay system for the reliable detection of EHV- 1 infection which was capable of eliminating the likelihood of false negative results. A region within the EHV- 1 glycoprotein B gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cloned and subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to generate a control <b>plasmid,</b> <b>amplifiable</b> by identical primers to wild type EHV- 1, yet capable of detection by an alternate dinitrophenylated oligonucleotide probe in a PCR/ELISA system. A competitive PCR/ELISA system which can control for the presence of PCR inhibitors and which is capable of detecting 63 genome equivalents of EHV- 1 has been developed. EHV- 1 presence in infected equine tissue and cell culture material was demonstrated using this system. The entire assay can be completed within one working day and facilitates multiple sample analysis. The availability of a robust, competitiv...|$|R
40|$|Herpes simplex virus type 1 {{glycoprotein}} H (HSV- 1 gH) was synthesized in an inducible {{mammalian cell}} expression system, and its properties were examined. The gH coding sequence, {{together with the}} stable 5 ' untranslated leader sequence from xenopus beta-globin, was placed under control of the strong promoter from the human cytomegalovirus major immediate-early gene in an <b>amplifiable</b> <b>plasmid</b> which contains the simian virus 40 (SV 40) virus origin for replication (ori). This expression vector was transfected into ts COS cells constitutively expressing a temperature-sensitive SV 40 T antigen which allows utilization of the SV 40 ori at permissive temperatures. The results of transient expression assays at the permissive temperature showed that HSV- 1 gH could be synthesized in greater amounts than those produced by a high-multiplicity virus infection. The proteins produced were detected in Western blots (immunoblots) with a HSV- 1 gH-specific polyclonal serum raised against a TrpE-gH fusion protein. The transfected gH had an apparent molecular weight of approximately 105, 000, intermediate in size {{to those of the}} precursor (100, 000) and fully processed forms (110, 000) of HSV- 1 gH from infections. Antigenicity was investigated by reactions with three virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies specific for conformational epitopes on gH. Only one of these monoclonal antibodies could immunoprecipitate the synthesized gH. However, equal recognition of the transfected gH was achieved by superinfection with virus. In addition, detectable amounts of gH were not expressed on the cell surface unless the cells were superinfected with virus. Studies with a temperature-sensitive mutant, ts 1201, defective in encapsidation showed that the changes in antigenic structure and cell surface expression caused by superinfection with virus were not due simply to incorporation of gH into virions. These results suggest that gH requires additional virus gene products for cell surface localization and formation of an antigenic structure important for its function in mediating infectivity...|$|E
