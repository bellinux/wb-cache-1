5|$|Chopin's tombstone, {{featuring}} the muse of music, Euterpe, weeping over a broken lyre, {{was designed and}} sculpted by Clésinger. The expenses of the funeral and monument, amounting to 5,000 francs, were covered by Jane Stirling, who also paid {{for the return of}} the composer's sister Ludwika to Warsaw. Ludwika took Chopin's heart in an urn, preserved in alcohol, back to Poland in 1850. She <b>also</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> collection of two hundred letters from Sand to Chopin; after 1851 these were returned to Sand, who seems to have destroyed them.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{on arrival}} in Port Jackson Baker <b>also</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> common-law wife {{from among the}} convicts – 25-year-old Susannah Huffnell, who had been sentenced to seven years {{transportation}} for petty larceny. Their only child, Elizabeth, was born on 1 January 1789. The relationship was not a happy one and Baker refused to accompany {{his wife and child}} when they were transferred to the remote colonial outpost of Norfolk Island in March 1790. Susannah and Elizabeth had no further contact with Baker, even after they returned to Sydney in the 1800s.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, bookmakers made {{a profit}} out of {{patriotic}} Britons placing bets on a Manchester United victory. William Hill reported two bets of around £20,000 placed on Manchester United, while Paddy Power received one of £5,500 and Ladbrokes one of £3,000. Ladbrokes <b>also</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> bet of £10,000 on a Barcelona win, but bookmakers reported {{that most of}} the money was put on Manchester United. Extrabet.com paid out £12,000 to a £3,000 bet on Samuel Eto'o to score the first goal at odds of 4–1.|$|E

5|$|The UERL had {{financial}} problems. Ticket {{prices were}} low and passenger numbers were significantly below the pre-opening estimates. The lower than expected passenger numbers were partly {{the result of}} competition between the UERL's lines {{and those of the}} other tube and sub-surface railway companies. The spread of street-level electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, <b>also</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> large number of passengers away from the trains.|$|E
5|$|With the victory, LSU {{remained}} atop {{all three}} polls at No.1. They <b>also</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> one game {{lead in the}} SEC Western Division standings over Alabama, and ultimately secured {{a place in the}} 2011 SEC Championship Game. The Tigers went on to finish the regular season 12–0 with victories over Western Kentucky, Ole Miss and Arkansas. In the SEC Championship, LSU rallied from an early double-digit deficit to defeat Georgia and won the conference championship, retained their unanimous No.1 ranking and secured a place in the BCS National Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Dean applied to the US Military Academy, but was rejected. He then tried to enlist in the United States Army during World War I, {{but he was too}} young to do so without his parents' permission, and his mother refused. Dean instead {{attended}} University of California at Berkeley studying pre-law. During this time, he <b>also</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> variety of side jobs, including a stevedore at the San Francisco docks, a motorman, and briefly as a patrolman for the Berkeley Police Department, where he worked under police chief August Vollmer. Dean originally sought to attain a Doctor of Law degree but only completed a Bachelor of Arts degree from Berkeley in 1922 before joining the Army.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} in 2012–2015 {{revealed that}} Nyuserre Ini undertook building {{works on the}} valley temple of Menkaure, as witness by numerous seal impressions bearing his serekh discovered on the site. These works ended a long period from the reign of Shepseskaf until his reign during which the Giza necropolis was not the object of royal attention. Beyond Menkaure's valley temple, Nyuserre apparently <b>also</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> wider interest {{in the administration of}} the pyramid town of Khafra and revived the cult of both Menkaure and queen Khentkaus I. According to Mark Lehner, this queen, who bore the same name as Nyuserre's mother and like his mother bore two pharaohs, provided Nyuserre with a genealogical link relating him to his Fourth Dynasty forebears. John Nolan believes that the mirroring position and names of both Khentkaus queens was emphasised so that Nyuserre could legimitise his rule after the troubled times surrounding Neferefre's death.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Marmaduke was academically {{gifted and}} also a keen boxer and long-distance swimmer. He <b>also</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> keen {{interest}} in mechanical things, particularly combustion engines, and was building Meccano models of aircraft and other vehicles {{by the age of}} 12. In his early teens, he became an avid amateur mechanic, fixing the family motor car and learning to drive. Marmaduke was never a hard worker and did not embark upon an academic career, but was considered to possess above average intelligence. In 1929, he passed the Junior Certificate Exam with first class honours. The certificate qualified him for Victoria Boy's High School from which he graduated in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Between 1935 and 1937, Kenyatta was {{employed}} as a linguistic informant for the Phonetics Department at University College London (UCL); his voice recordings of the Kikuyu language assisted Lilias Armstrong in her production of The Phonetic and Tonal Structure of Kikuyu. The book was posthumously published under Armstrong's name, although Kenyatta claimed {{that he should have}} been recognised as co-author. He enrolled at UCL as a student, studying an English course between January and July 1935 and then a course in phonetics from October 1935 to June 1936. Enabled {{by a grant from the}} International African Institute, he <b>also</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> social anthropology course under Bronisław Malinowski at the London School of Economics (LSE). Kenyatta lacked the qualifications normally required to join the course, but Malinowski was keen to support the participation of indigenous peoples in anthropological research. For Kenyatta, acquiring an advanced degree would bolster his status among Kenyans and display his intellectual equality with white Europeans.|$|E

5|$|Bradman rotated the two glovemen {{during the}} tour, and Tallon played in 14 of the 31 {{first-class}} matches, taking 29 catches and 14 stumpings. Tallon's catch of Len Hutton in the Fifth Test at The Oval {{was described as}} Wisden as {{the best of the}} year. He <b>also</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> difficult catch to remove George Emmett in the Third Test at Old Trafford, catching a ball that flew to his feet at yorker length. However, Tallon also had some mishaps, with finger injuries inflicted by failing to catch the ball correctly. Tallon had few opportunities with the bat, scoring 283 runs at a batting average of 25.72 in 13 first-class innings, including two fifties. During the Test, Tallon scored 112 runs at 28.00, including a 53 in the Second Test that saw Australia recover to a first innings of 350 after a middle-order slump had seen England take the upper hand. He took 12 catches in the Tests.|$|E
5|$|First-class cricket resumed in Australia in 1945–46 {{after the}} end of the war, {{although}} the Shield competition was not held that season. O'Reilly captained New South Wales at the age of 40, and although the emergence of Ray Lindwall and Ernie Toshack in the state side indicated a shift in emphasis away from spin and towards faster bowling, O'Reilly maintained his pre-war standards. He took 33 wickets at 14.36 in six matches and New South Wales were undefeated; they won four matches and drew both fixtures against Victoria. He took at least two wickets in every innings and claimed his innings best of 6/43 against Queensland. O'Reilly <b>also</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> match total of 7/94 in an innings win over the Australian Services team, which had drawn a series against a full-strength England team.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, the Disneys {{moved to}} Kansas City, Missouri. There, Disney {{attended}} the Benton Grammar School, {{where he met}} fellow-student Walter Pfeiffer, who came {{from a family of}} theatre fans and introduced Disney to the world of vaudeville and motion pictures. Before long, he was spending more time at the Pfeiffers' house than at home. Elias had purchased a newspaper delivery route for The Kansas City Star and Kansas City Times. Disney and his brother Roy woke up at 4:30 every morning to deliver the Times before school and repeated the round for the evening Star after school. The schedule was exhausting, and Disney often received poor grades after falling asleep in class, but he continued his paper route for more than six years. He attended Saturday courses at the Kansas City Art Institute and <b>also</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> correspondence course in cartooning.|$|E

5|$|In February 1828, Martin Harris {{arrived to}} assist Smith by transcribing his dictation. Harris <b>also</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> {{sample of the}} {{characters}} to a few prominent scholars, including Charles Anthon. Harris said Anthon initially authenticated the characters and their translation, but then retracted his opinion after learning that Smith claimed to have received the plates from an angel. Anthon denied Harris's account of the meeting, claiming instead that {{he had tried to}} convince Harris that he was the victim of a fraud. In any event, Harris returned to Harmony in April 1828, and continued as Smith's scribe.|$|E
5|$|In July 1860, Willis {{took his}} last major trip. Along with his wife, {{he stopped in}} Chicago and Yellow Springs, Ohio, as far west as Madison, Wisconsin, and <b>also</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> {{steamboat}} down the Mississippi River to St. Louis, Missouri, and returned through Cincinnati, Ohio and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1861, Willis allowed the Home Journal to break its pledge to avoid taking sides in political discussions when the Confederate States of America was established, calling the move a purposeful act to bring on war. On May 28, 1861, Willis {{was part of a}} committee of literary figures—including William Cullen Bryant, Charles Anderson Dana, and Horace Greeley—to invite Edward Everett to speak in New York on behalf of maintaining the Union. The Home Journal lost many subscribers during the American Civil War, Morris died in 1864, and the Willis family had to take in boarders and for a time turned Idlewild into a girls' school for income.|$|E
5|$|In March, the pro-German Yugoslav {{government}} was toppled. A furious Hitler ordered the attack to {{be expanded to}} include Yugoslavia. Operation Marita commenced on 7 April. The Luftwaffe committed StG 1, 2 and 77 to the campaign. The Stuka once again spearheaded the air assault, with a front line strength of 300 machines, against minimal Yugoslav resistance in the air, allowing the Stukas to develop a fearsome reputation in this region. Operating unmolested, they took a heavy toll of ground forces, suffering only light losses to ground fire. The effectiveness of the dive bombers helped bring about Yugoslav capitulation in just ten days. The Stukas <b>also</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> peripheral part in Operation Punishment, Hitler's retribution bombing of Belgrade. The dive bombers were to attack airfields and anti-aircraft gun positions whilst the level bombers struck civilian targets. Belgrade was badly damaged, with 2,271 people reported killed and 12,000 injured.|$|E

In 1966 Le Mesurier also {{played the role of}} Colonel Maynard in the ITV sitcom George and the Dragon, with Sid James and Peggy Mount. The programme ran to four series between 1966 and 1968, totalling 26 episodes. He <b>also</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> role in four episodes of a Coronation Street spin-off series, Pardon the Expression, in which he starred opposite Arthur Lowe.|$|E
5|$|Not all of {{the monks}} were {{attracted}} by Symeon's zealous approach. Symeon attempted to reform the Byzantine monasteries, where monks had become subservient to the emperor and had acquired large holdings of property, libraries, and art. His writings and teachings were aimed at returning the monasteries to their traditional role in the early church, urging the monks {{to take up a}} life of simplicity, asceticism, purity of heart, and constant prayer. The strict monastic discipline for which Symeon aimed upset several monks in the monastery. Symeon <b>also</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> more emotional approach to worship, suggesting that a monk shouldn't take the sacrament without tears. The introduction of vegetarian meals, along with other unique practices to instill discipline and humility, also caused some displeasure among the monks.|$|E

Like the 1930s films, this pilot <b>also</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> more mature turn.
