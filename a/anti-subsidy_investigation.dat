It’s aim to analysis {{the reason why}} EU usually launch investigation of China and why China always as the target involved in disputes by other trade partners. i compared respective situation and the conclusion is that china as a non market economy status not granted by EU, in the condition of EU lost more from the trade with China,so it is easily arouse conflicts between them.

30|$|As China’s PV {{and wind}} energy exports have grown rapidly, Chinese {{companies}} {{have become the}} victims of protectionism abroad. The USA launched an anti-dumping and <b>anti-subsidy</b> <b>investigation</b> into turbine equipment and PV products imported from China, causing huge losses to Chinese companies. The verdict against China has greatly hindered Chinese PV equipment exports to the USA. Following {{in the footsteps of}} the USA, the German Solar Energy Association planned to raise an anti-dumping case in 27 EU countries against China. Such protectionism practices suffocate China’s rapid growth in the new energy industry. China’s solar photovoltaic product exports dropped over the period from January to June 2012, after rapid growth for six consecutive years. The industry’s exports are now valued at US$ 12.894 billion, down YoY by 31.49  %. Leading enterprises such as Suntech, Jiangxi Saiwei, and Baoding Yingli endured huge export losses, while some others saw their share prices plummet in American stock markets. Those companies which performed the best in the past suffered the greatest losses.|$|E
40|$|Climate Change {{has found}} its way into the World Trade Organization through the {{backdoor}} of the profitable and contentious trade in solar and wind energy technologies. In addition to the Ontario FIT dispute critically examined in this article, there are at least five other active disputes in Geneva over aspects of trade in wind and solar technologies, with more on the horizon. Solar panels constitute a significant part of China’s total export sales in the EU and {{for more than two years}} its trade has overheated EU-China relations. The anti-dumping and <b>anti-subsidy</b> <b>investigations</b> that resulted have now culminated in a tentative settlement to bring Chinese solar panel prices to a “sustainable” level. Winds have been blowing more strongly on the other side of the Atlantic, though in a similar direction, where the US imposed record high rates of anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Chinese (and Vietnamese) wind towers, as well as silicon solar panels. The political economy unfolding in both cases has been quite similar: on one side - claiming unfair trade allegedly committed by the Chinese exporters - are the import-competing manufacturers of Renewable Energy (`RE’) technology, and on the other side, the rest of the RE industry, particularly generators in whose interest it is to have access to the best and cheapest equipment, regardless of origin...|$|R
