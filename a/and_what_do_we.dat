6000|$|True, you {{may raise}} a dumb beast above that, by taming and {{training}} it. You may teach a horse or dog {{to do what}} it does not like, and give it a sense of duty, and as it were awaken a soul in it. That is very wonderful, that {{we should be able to}} do so. It is a sign that man is made in God's likeness. But I cannot stay to speak of that now. I say our flesh, our animal nature, is selfish and self- indulgent. I do not say, therefore, that it is bad: God forbid. God made our bodies and brains, as well as our souls; and God makes nothing bad. It is blasphemous to say that he does. No, our bodies as bodies are good; the flesh as flesh is good, when it is in its right place; and its right place is to be servant, not master. We are not to walk after the flesh, says St. Paul: but the flesh is to walk after the spirit--in English, our bodies are to obey our spirits, our souls. For man has something higher than body in him. He has a spirit in him; and it is just having this spirit which makes him a man. For this spirit cares about higher things than mere gain and comfort. It can feel pity and mercy, love and generosity, justice and honour; and when a man not only feels them, but obeys them, then he is a true man--a Christian man: but, on the other hand, if a man does not; if he be a man in whom there is no mercy or pity, no generosity, no benevolence, no justice or honour; who cares for nothing and no one but himself, and filling his own stomach and his own pulse, and pleasing his own brute appetites in some way, what should you say of that man? You would say, he is like a brute beast--and you would say right--you would say just what St. Paul says. St. Paul would say, that man is fulfilling the lusts of the flesh; and you and St. Paul would mean just the same thing. Now, St. Paul says, 'The flesh in us lusts against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh.' <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> gain by the spirit in us lusting against the flesh, and pulling us the opposite way? We gain this, St. Paul says, 'that we cannot do the things that we would.' ...|$|E
6000|$|So shall it be {{with every}} soul of man who, {{being in the}} deep, cries out of that deep to God, whether in bloody India or in {{peaceful}} England. For He with whom {{we have to do}} is not a tyrant, but a Father; not a taskmaster, but a Giver and a Redeemer. We may ask him freely, as David does, to consider our complaint, because he will consider it well, and understand it, and do it justice. He is not extreme to mark what is done amiss, and therefore we can abide his judgments. There is mercy with him, and therefore it is worth while to fear him. He waits for us year after year, with patience which cannot tire; therefore it is but fair that we should wait a while for him. With him is plenteous redemption, and therefore redemption enough for us, and for those likewise whom we love. He will redeem us from all our sins: <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> need more? He will make us perfect, even as our Father in heaven is perfect. Let him then, if he must, make us perfect by sufferings. By sufferings Christ was made perfect; and what was the best path for Jesus Christ is surely good enough for us, even though it be a rough and a thorny one. Let us lie still beneath God's hand; for though his hand be heavy upon us, it is strong and safe beneath us too; and none can pluck us out of his hand, for in him we live and move and have our being; and though we go down into hell with David, with David we shall find God there, and find, with David, that he will not leave our souls in hell, or suffer his holy ones to see corruption. Yes; have faith in God. Nothing in thee which he has made shall see corruption; for it is a thought of God's, and no thought of his can perish. Nothing shall be purged out of thee but thy disease; nothing shall be burnt out of thee but thy dross; and that in thee shall be saved, and live to all eternity, of which God said at the beginning, Let us make man in our own image. Yes. Have faith in God; and say to him once for all, 'Though thou slay me, yet will I love thee; for thou lovedst me in Jesus Christ before the foundation of the world.' ...|$|E

Such [...] propositions, where they are not mere definitions, as some of them [...] are, carry their inductive origin {{on the face of}} their [...] enunciation.... Those which declare that two straight lines can not [...] inclose a space, and that two straight lines which cut one another [...] can not both be parallel to a third, are in reality the only ones [...] which express characteristic properties of space, and these it will [...] be worth while to consider more nearly.

And (not to dwell on the notion of continued [...] contemplation, i.e., mental experience, as included in the very [...] idea of uniformity; nor on that of transfer of the contemplating [...] being from point to point, and of experience, during such transfer, [...] of the homogeneity of the interval passed over) we can not even [...] propose the proposition in an intelligible form to any one whose [...] experience ever since he was born has not assured him of the fact. [...] The unity of direction, or that we can not march from a given point [...] by more than one path direct to the same object, is matter of [...] practical experience long before it can by possibility become matter [...] of abstract thought. We can not attempt mentally to exemplify the [...] conditions of the assertion in an imaginary case opposed to it, [...] without violating our habitual recollection of this experience, and [...] defacing our mental picture of space as grounded on it. What but [...] experience, we may ask, can possibly assure us of the homogeneity of [...] the parts of distance, time, force, and measurable aggregates in [...] general, on which the truth of the other axioms depends? As regards [...] the latter axiom, after what has been said it must be clear that the [...] very same course of remarks equally applies to its case, and that [...] its truth is quite as much forced on the mind as that of the former [...] by daily and hourly experience, ... including always, be it [...] observed, in our notion of experience, that which is gained by [...] contemplation of the inward picture which the mind forms to itself [...] in any proposed case, or which it arbitrarily selects as an [...] example—such picture, in virtue of the extreme simplicity of these [...] primary relations, being called up by the imagination with as much [...] vividness and clearness as could be done by any external impression, [...] which is the only meaning we can attach to the word intuition, as [...] applied to such relations.” ...|$|E
