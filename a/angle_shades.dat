40|$|The {{building}} simulation tool Domus {{has been}} recently renamed as PowerDomus for whole-building hygrothermal and energy simulation.

40|$|The China Central Government is {{determined}} to promote the use of solar PV in providing electricity to rural areas as well as supplementing power in cities; the installed PV capacity is predicted to be over 4. 2 GW by year 2015. To attend such a target, the annual expansion rate of PV installations in China and nearby regions has to be over 40 %. At the same time, in May 2005, the Hong Kong local government also established its target in alternative energy, which is 1 to 2 % by 2012. With such a rapidly expanding market, the capability in accurately predicting the real performance of a PV system to be installed; together with the proper monitoring and evaluation of its performance are thus of crucial importance to designing of these systems.

40|$|Reducing or {{stabilizing}} the stream temperature of ChiChiaWan Creek {{is a crucial}} work for Formosan Landlocked Salmon because ChiChiaWan Creek {{is the only one}} habitat for this endangered species. Planting trees in the riparian zone {{would be one of the}} alternatives. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of several planting strategies on daily maximum stream temperature along the river. The results showed the effective vegetative <b>shading</b> <b>angles</b> should be more than 50 掳 along ChiChiaWan Creek to reduce the direct solar radiation heating effectively. Upstream planting with 70 掳 vegetative <b>shading</b> <b>angle</b> could be the most effective way among all the scenarios. However, this planting strategy could not improve the worst situations in summer because of the large solar elevation angles. The upstream planting in ChiChiaWan Creek was strongly recommended because the canopies could be easier to extend to totally cover the narrow width of river producing the most effective shades. Practicing the upstream planting with 90 掳 vegetative <b>shading</b> <b>angle</b> can increase more than 1 km long suitable habitats for the endangered Salmon in summer. Alternatively, the west-side planting scenario was the second effective way for temperature reduction. Our result provided a useful suggestion for the authorities in charge of saving the Formosan Landlocked Salmon, particularly under the stress of global warming. 漏 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} role of solar radiation on Solenopsis invicta, the red imported fire ant. This ant is considered a serious invasive pest in the southern United States. Four Texas cities where fire ants are found were studied: San Antonio, Corpus Christi, Wichita Falls, and the outlier, Lubbock. <b>Shade</b> <b>angles</b> were measured in eight compass directions within plots located along eight transect directions around buildings.

The number of nests and the area of nest coverage was measured in each plot and compared to the solar radiation data. The data indicate that the time of day of lowest radiation, total radiation, and morning radiation are an important factor in number of nests found within a plot. In addition, temperature, precipitation, and distance from the building were also important in increased number and size of Solenopsis invicta nests. ...|$|R

Reflectance standardized for differences in sensor radiometric response by the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan coefficients increased significantly from 1973 to 1983, but standardization by Landsat Data Users Handbook coefficients resulted in little long-term change.

40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} of improved road light design for drivers and pedestrians {{with the use}} of a ray- or reverse ray-tracing method. Many existing road lights are unsuitable for drivers and pedestrians because of serious problems such as glare effect or randomicity of illuminated areas. This situation has arisen because in customary design methods the emphasis has been on simple factors such as luminance or electrical power. However a high luminance or electrical power consumption, alone, do not guarantee bright and good road lighting. So we have applied a ray-tracing method to the design of a road light reflector with the goals of ensuring that illuminated objects on the road can be seen more clearly and that the illuminating light is more comfortable for the eyes of drivers and pedestrians. We have set design targets for factors such as the uniformity of lighting on the road area per road light, the <b>shading</b> <b>angles</b> and the continuous luminance uniformity on long lengths of road. For set heights of the eyes of drivers and pedestrians eyes we have calculated a design guideline for the achievement of the above design targets. Then we designed a road light reflector using the reverse ray-tracing approach. Also we have achieved the same luminance on the road with almost half the power consumption, through the reduction of lighty loss. In an ideal design optimum parameters are suggested to be a <b>shading</b> <b>angle</b> of 75 degrees and a luminance uniformity of 0. 5 on the road area. This reflecto...|$|R

40|$|Sun shading devices, {{either as}} parts of a {{building}} or separately placed from a building facade, affect natural lighting and ventilation, solar gain, and overall building performance. The role of sun shading devices or solar radiation control systems is taught at every school of architecture. Yet, only a few architecture students, architects, and designers have applied them to reduce glare, control light intensity, radiation, and minimize cooling load on their projects. Using a well-designed computer program to teach, and re-teach when necessary, the use of sun shading devices is more understandable, clear, and interesting than reading {{a book on the}} same topic. Having a readily available tool would also encourage architects and designers to use the shading devices as a method of conserving energy and lowering operating cost in the buildings that they design.

40|$|The solar, longwave, and {{convective}} {{interactions between}} a window, its shading attachments and its surroundings constitute a complicated coupled heat balance problem that can entail significant computational intensity to simulate in detail.

CPU time is reduced without forfeiting features {{such as the ability}} to distinguish between air and mean radiant temperatures. The required indices of merit are obtained using thermal network theory and can safely be re-evaluated much less frequently than each time-step, or they can be revised as needed in response to changes in sun <b>angle</b> or <b>shade</b> geometry (e. g., blind slat adjustment). This method has been used to integrate the ASHWAT fenestration model with the California Simulation Engine, a detailed residential model.
