40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a software module for the control of devices in the CERN particle accelerators. This module is called GFAS (Generateur de Fonction Analogique Simple – Simple <b>Analogue</b> <b>Function</b> Generator), as the board it drives, and its purpose is to generate different functions (i. e., voltage or current waveforms) at different times as needed by the CERN accelerators. Accelerator technicians define a set of different functions by several parameters and a real time system selects the right function at the right time according to the information given by control messages sent by the main timing system. The software has been developed with the FESA (Front-End Software Architecture) framework developed at CERN. This work was done by the candidate within a CERN Technical Student Program at the AB (Accelerator and Beams) department, CO (COntrols) group, FC (Front-ends and Communications) section of CERN...|$|E
40|$|In {{common with}} much {{accelerator}} specific material, {{there is a}} constant need to improve both hardware and software for power converter control. Maintenance and performance improvements of older systems have become extremely tedious and in some areas impossible. By using modern real-time software and the latest high-performance processors, such problems should be substantially reduced. This paper describes the software concepts and the hardware chosen for the upgrade of the existing facilities. Using the UNIX compatible LynxOS real time kernel, running on a PowerPC 603 in a VME environment, this new approach provides excellent performance while retaining the desired flexibility for future enhancements. The 64 channel system is implemented as a set of cooperating processes, several of which are multi-threaded. Processes include <b>analogue</b> <b>function</b> generation, analogue measurement and digital I/O, all of which are accurately scheduled by the accelerator timing system. This generalised structure, which performs complex sequences of operations is described in detail, as well as how it can be adapted {{to a wide variety of}} accelerator tasks...|$|E

Other themes have an arithmetic character (as 9 - 12) on number theoretic problems in Geometry. Chapter 2 includes various diophantine equations, {{some of which are}} treatable by elementary methods; others are partial solutions of certain unsolved problems.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{comparison of}} the incorporation of methyl- 3 H-thymidine and 6 - 3 H-deoxyuridine into the DNA of Drosophila melanogaster in the presence {{and in the absence}} of 5 -fluorouracil indicated that 5 -fluorouracil inhibits the reaction converting dUMP to dTMP catalysed by thymidylate synthetase (methylenetetrahydrofolate:dUrd- 5 '-P C-methyltransferase, E. C. 2. 1. 1. b). The enzyme exhibits maximal activity at pH 7 [middle dot] 5 to 8 [middle dot] 0 and is protected from heat inactivation by deoxyuridine monophosphate. The addition of thiol compounds to the homogenization buffer results in the enhancement of synthetase activity. The Km values for deoxyuridine monophosphate and 5, 10 -methylenetetrahydrofolate are 6 [middle dot] 8 x 10 - 6 M and 8 [middle dot] 3 x 10 - 5 M, respectively. Fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate, trifluoromethyldeoxyuridine monophosphate, and methotrexate are inhibitors of the enzyme. 5 -Bromodeoxyuridine and 5 -iododeoxyuridine have no inhibitory effect. The results support the contention that, under conditions which induce morphological lesions in Drosophila, fluorinated pyrimidines and methotrexate inhibit the de novo synthesis of thymidylate whereas thymidine <b>analogues</b> <b>function</b> in some other manner...|$|R
40|$|Current {{technology}} {{allows for}} the integration of complete systems onto a single chip. These systems on chip (SoC) are increasingly designed by connecting together large pre-designed and verified modules, called cores, with the advantage being a faster design cycle. The development of third party Intellectual Property (IP) cores is a rapidly expanding industry, and whereas initially these were nearly all digital, analogue IP cores are now representing {{a greater proportion of}} this market. In this report we consider issues which should be addressed when designing analogue IP cores, from low-level circuit realisations to high level design methodologies. The switched current (SI) technique can implement <b>analogue</b> <b>functions</b> on the most basic of digital processes and further advantages of high speed and low voltage operation, suggest that this may be particularly suitable for implementing analogue IP cores.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} design, {{operation}} and future {{development of a}} transportable neutron spectrometer (TNS). Analogue signal processing techniques are used to condition the signals from an array of radiation sensors, comprising five gas-filled sensors and a hydrogenous oil-filled scintillator. This high reliance on analogue signal processing techniques {{is because of the}} nano-second rise time of the pulses produced from the sensor array. The analogue circuitry requires a high degree of expertise from the operator and frequent instrument calibration. An overview of the present instrument will be given together with a description of how the raw data from the individual sensor channels are combined to give a continuous neutron energy spectrum. Digital processing techniques are now being applied to the TNS to handle some of the more complex <b>analogue</b> <b>functions,</b> particularly neutron/γ-ray pulse-shape discrimination for the photo-scintillator column. Potential advantages of this approach are on qualities such as usability, reliability, testability, repeatability and portability of the instrument.
