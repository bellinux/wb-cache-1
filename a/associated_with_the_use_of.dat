5|$|A {{survey of}} 1000 {{secondary}} school pupils and university students in Tayside conducted in February 2010 found 20% {{of them had}} previously taken mephedrone. Although {{at the time it}} was available legally over the internet, only 10% of users reported purchasing it online, with most purchasing it from street dealers. Of those who had used mephedrone, 97% said it was easy or very easy to obtain. Around 50% of users reported at least one negative effect <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> mephedrone, of which teeth grinding is the most common. Detailed interviews with users in Northern Ireland similarly found that few purchased mephedrone online, with most interviewees citing concerns that their address would be traced or that family members could intercept the package.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm Robert Jardine (8 June 1869– 16 January 1947) was an English {{first-class}} cricketer {{who played}} 46 matches, mainly for Oxford University. Although his first-class record was not impressive, he scored 140 in the University Match of 1892 using an unorthodox batting method. He played a few matches for Middlesex but later {{went to work}} in India, in effect ending his English first-class career. He played first-class cricket in India for the Europeans and after a successful legal career, returned to England. His son Douglas went on to play cricket for Oxford, Surrey and England, captaining the latter two and being <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> Bodyline bowling.|$|E

25|$|Most {{people with}} sickle-cell disease have {{intensely}} painful episodes called vaso-occlusive crises. However, the frequency, severity, {{and duration of}} these crises vary tremendously. Painful crises are treated symptomatically with pain medications; pain management requires opioid administration at regular intervals until the crisis has settled. For milder crises, a subgroup of patients manage on NSAIDs (such as diclofenac or naproxen). For more severe crises, most patients require inpatient management for intravenous opioids; patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) devices are commonly used in this setting. Diphenhydramine is also an effective agent that doctors frequently prescribe to help control itching <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> opioids.|$|E
