The results are as follows 1. The alumina geltreated material causes redness in twelve hours after the inoculation, but induration and ulcer formation the most remarkable signs, appear from fourty-eight to seventy-two hours later. After ninety-six hours, both of these redness and induration gradually disappear. 2. The result of the skin reaction by alumina geltreated material should be judged from fourty-eight to seventy-two hours after the inoculation.

For core and shell materials, colloidal gels composed of submicron carbon and alumina powders were developed, respectively. Simultaneously, the co-extrusion process was also studied by numerical simulation to investigate the feed pressure-dependent wall thickness. Design/methodology/approach: Significant differences in the rheological behavior of the carbon and <b>alumina</b> <b>gels</b> were observed due to differences of the particle morphology and surface chemistry of the carbon and alumina powders. Precise control over the cross-sectional diameter of the core and shell green state elements was achieved by alteration of the feed pressures used during co-extrusion. Findings: After subsequent thermal treatment in an oxidizing atmosphere (e. g. air), in which the carbon core was oxidized and burned out, lattice structures formed of hollow filaments of predetermined wall thickness were manufactured; additionally C-Al 2 O 3 core-shell filament lattice structures could be derived after firing in an argon atmosphere. Originality/value: Green lattice truss structures with carbon core and alumina shell filaments were successfully manufactured by robotically controlled co-extrusion.

The two destabilization mechanisms lead to gels of significantly different microstructures. We find notable differences in the rheological behavior of the two systems, suggesting a bond-bending mechanism for stress transmission in the case of ΔpH gels and a bond-stretching mechanism in the case of ΔI gels. In addition, for both kinds of gels we compare the in situ properties to those obtained after altering the microstructure by shearing.

40|$|Sewer {{networks}} should withstand several aggressions, including biodeterioration processes. This {{study is}} focusing on cementitious materials since, depending on their composition, these materials do not display the same behaviour when biogenic sulfuric acid attack occurs. In severe conditions, ordinary Portland cement materials can be deteriorated, while calcium aluminate cement (CAC) materials show good resistance to biogenic corrosion. Results show that this durability difference {{is due to the}} difference of cement mineralogy. Firstly, the H 2 S abiotic oxidation into elemental sulfur is less favourable on CAC. Hence it provides much less nutrients for sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms. Then, the presence of high aluminium content in CAC provides a combination of interesting properties to face biogenic acid attack. The hydrated alumina reacts with acid to create an <b>alumina</b> <b>gel</b> layer, stable up to pH 3 - 4. The acid attack leads to the release of aluminium ions displaying a bacteriostatic effect on neutrophilic sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms.

Increasing pH values, hydrolysis ratio and/or temperature accelerated the kinetics of hydrolysis–condensation reactions and thus reduced the gel time. The apparent activation energy of the cross-linking leading to the gelation calculated from the gel times at various temperatures was found to be approximately 139 kJ mol− 1 and independent of hydrolysis ratio.

The experiments in this communication confirm Rhoads' observation, and show further that the adsorption {{as well as the}} inactivation are reversible; i. e., by changing the pH to the alkaline side with M/ 15 Na 2 HPO 4 it is possible to free the virus in a state in which it is again capable of producing typical poliomyelitis. These experiments show also that by this process the virus undergoes considerable purification by diminution in the concentration of non-virus-containing substances. Washing the <b>alumina</b> <b>gel</b> C-virus complex with M/ 5 NaCl-M/ 15 KH 2 PO 4 apparently dissociates no virus but is capable of freeing a certain amount of extractible organic substances.

Unlike the traditional viewpoint, Keggin-Al- 13 can form in solution without localized high alkalinity. The reaction of oligomers with Al(OH) (4) (-) resulted from the dissolving of colloidal Al hydroxides is accountable for the formation of Keggin-Al- 13. Al-pl, the defected structure of Al- 13, was considered as the transient species in the transformation from Al- 13 to crystalline Al hydroxides. Besides Al- 13, some other reactive polymers with hexameric ring structure also exist. The two categories of Al species have different transformation models (i. e., forced hydrolysis and spontaneous hydrolysis). The forced hydrolysis model should be the main transformation pattern for Al species under the condition of strong base addition into Al solution.
