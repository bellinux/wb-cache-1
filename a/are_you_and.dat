Morceau Subrosa is very different in style compared to most of BT's previous works, favoring ambient soundscapes and minimal beats.|$|E
500|$|... "Carry Out" [...] is one {{of twelve}} songs written and {{produced}} by Timbaland and J-Roc for Timbaland's third studio album Shock Value II (2009). Justin Timberlake, Attitude and Jim Beanz, notable collaborators with Timbaland, also assisted {{in the writing of}} the song. Timbaland, in an interview with MTV's Shaheem Reed and Gil Kaufman, stated that he favored this song over other recordings because the process for creating the song was similar to those of other collaborations they have done. Timberlake would come into the studio and listen to the track. Afterwards, he would then compose the lyrics in his head. Upon explaining their method of making music, Timbaland stated that: [...] "We got a chemistry that cannot be described. People ask, 'Well, what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> Justin like?' Can't tell you what it's like — it's a chemistry that can't be described. Something you would have to see for yourself and be, like, 'Them two got magic'." [...] Timbaland stated that the song resembles a [...] "2010 version" [...] of Snoop Dogg's [...] "Drop It Like It's Hot", produced by The Neptunes. He also revealed that the intention of the song was to provide a different slang for women: [...] "Instead of 'Your phat butt' or 'Your big breasts,' we say, 'Oh, I need you. Can I be your carry out? Be my carry out. I want you to be my dinner, my leftovers, my everything.' It's a different slang. We're grown men, I wanna be subliminal to females. Like, 'Oooh, carry out? That's kinda sexy'." ...|$|E

2500|$|The apparitions of Our Lady of Good Help were {{reported}} by Adele Brise in 1859. In December 2010, Bishop David L. Ricken of Green Bay, Wisconsin approved the apparition as worthy of belief, as the first Marian apparition approved in the United States at the local level. In Robinsonville (now called Champion) WI, a young Belgian immigrant woman named Adele Brise was walking through a wooded area when she saw a beautiful woman standing between a maple and a hemlock tree. She saw the lady again {{on her way to}} Mass, and walked past her again. After Mass she told her priest about the apparition, and he told her to ask the Lady [...] "In God's name, who <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> what do you want of me?" [...] When Adele walked past the spot again, the Lady was there, and Adele asked what she was told by the priest. The Lady replied, [...] "I am the Queen of Heaven who prays for the conversion of sinners." [...] She gave Adele the mission to teach the children of the area their Catechism, which Adele did faithfully. Soon after, Adele's father built a small chapel between the trees, and later two more churches were built on the spot before the present brick church, built in 1942. The apparitions, attributed to Our Lady of Good Help, were approved on December 8, 2010, by Bishop David L. Ricken of the Diocese of Green Bay.|$|E
