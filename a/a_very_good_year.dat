25|$|Stengel {{kept his}} word and named Paige to the 1953 All-Star team despite Paige not having <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>year.</b> He {{got in the}} game in the eighth inning. First, Paige got Gil Hodges to line out, then after Roy Campanella singled up the middle, Eddie Mathews popped out. He then walked Duke Snider, and Enos Slaughter lined a hit to center to score Campanella. National League pitcher Murry Dickson drove in Snider, but was thrown out at second base trying to stretch the hit into a double. Paige ended the year with a disappointing 3–9 record, but a respectable 3.53 ERA. Paige was {{released}} after the season when Veeck once again had to sell the team.|$|E

In 2007 macroeconomic growth, excluding the agricultural sector, remained quite robust, providing the background for dynamic growth in banking credits. Total {{assets of the}} banking sector increased by 21.6% to MAD 654.7 billion ($85.1 billion), which is above the previous year's high annual growth rate of 18.1%. The structure of the domestic sector has remained steady {{in the past two}} years, with the landscape dominated by three major local banks. The state has started to remove itself from the domestic sector by surrendering part of its share capital in public banks. At end-2007 public capital still held controlling stakes in five banks and four financing companies. Meanwhile, foreign ownership in the local financial sector continues to grow, with foreign institutions controlling five banks and eight financing companies as well as holding significant stakes in four banks and three financing companies.|$|E

500|$|In each of {{the four}} seasons from 1922 to 1925, Yorkshire won the County Championship. Rhodes scored over 1,000 runs each year, {{averaging}} over 30 except in 1924; in 1925 his average was 40.91, only the second time it exceeded 40 in an English cricket season. Rhodes, by now part of a very powerful county bowling attack, was usually the fourth or fifth bowler used. Although he imparted less spin to the ball than in his younger days, he continually bowled a good length and placed fielders in positions which very effectively blocked the scoring opportunities of the batsmen. He took over 100 wickets in 1922, 1923 and 1924, but took only 57 in 1925, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>year</b> for batting. As Yorkshire's senior professional Rhodes was very influential in this period. He cultivated a hostile attitude among the bowlers, directed the team tactically and raised its standard of fielding. Alan Hill wrote that Yorkshire captains (who were usually poor cricketers) generally deferred to Rhodes as senior professional; for example, Arthur Lupton, captain from 1925 to 1927, [...] "very wisely left the cricket affairs to the joint supervision of Rhodes and Emmott Robinson." [...] Stories emerged that he was an [...] "overmighty subject", arranging the positions of fielders and changing the bowler without reference to his nominal captain. In one story, Yorkshire had scored around 400. Lupton, hoping to score some easy runs, came out of the amateur dressing room with his bat when a young professional touched his arm and said, [...] "It's all right, sir. Mr Rhodes has declared [...]" [...] However, all the captains to whom biographer Sidney Rogerson spoke mentioned their good relations with Rhodes, although they agreed that he could be difficult. [...] Beverley Lyon, who captained Gloucestershire between 1929 and 1934, criticised Rhodes for insisting young professionals take the game seriously, thus promoting a no-risk attitude.|$|E

To keep him satisfied Emelec officials paid Juárez the highest salary of the Ecuadorian league. However, in 2004 this was insufficient to convince him to stay and he left Emelec for free, to play for Spanish side Real Murcia, becoming the first Ecuadorian player to take advantage of Bossman's law.|$|R

40|$|Background: We report {{successful}} {{treatment of}} a patient 6 years after ascending aorta and aortic valve replacement suffering {{from a combination of}} two pseudoaneurysms. The first of them originated from the coronary ostial suture line and the second pseudoaneurysm originated from the distal suture line. Methods: We performed re-replantation of the left main trunk to the prosthesis and then we resected the pseudoaneurysm originating from the distal suture line and we replaced the entire aorta by a vascular graft. Results: The postoperative convalescence was uneventful, the patient was discharged two weeks after the surgery. The patient is currently in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> condition one <b>year</b> after the surgery. Conclusions: Coronary ostial pseudoaneurysm in patients after ascending aorta and aortic valve replacement with the use of “button technique ” is a quite rare situation. The combination of two pseudoaneurysms originating from different suture lines in one patient seems to be unique in literature reviews...|$|R

Murtagh settled Lillie Langtry in mid-division as Gile Na Greine set a steady pace before moving up to challenge the leader in the straight. Lillie Langtry took the lead a furlong out and won by one and quarter lengths from Gile Na Greine with Jacqueline Quest in third place. Following the filly's win O'Brien said [...] "We always thought she was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> filly last <b>year...</b> it is a credit to everybody for getting her back" [...] before indicating that she would probably be moved up in distance. Murtagh commented [...] "She was by far our best filly last year, and going to the Breeders' Cup, I was wondering how far we were going to win by. That didn't happen, but she came back well in our Guineas and her home work had been very good". Despite O'Brien's predictions, Lillie Langtry was kept to a mile for her next race. She matched against older fillies and mares and started the 9/4 favourite for the Group One Falmouth Stakes at Newmarket in July. After reaching second place in the last quarter mile she faded in the closing stages and finished fifth of the eight runners behind Music Show, who won by a neck from the five-year-old mare Spacious.|$|R
