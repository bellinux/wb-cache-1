40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the use of}} avian bone remains recovered from archaeological excavations in comparison with other animal bone evidence. My aim was to give a brief overview on the topics that are usually faced by an archaeo-ornithologist. The wide scale of subjects includes bird bone preservation rata and methodologies concerning the identifi cation and measurements taken on avian skeletal elements. Taphonomic characteristics involve differential bone density and preservation in archaeological deposits. This item may also be infl uenced by the special use of fowls or their body parts by people. Results on <b>avian</b> <b>materials</b> contribute considerably to palaeo-environmental studies, as the majority of species have special requirements regarding the occupied habitat, climate and breeding region. Different aspects considering the role of fowls in the cultural life and symbolic system of ancient people are also discussed.

40|$|One of {{the most}} unique and {{striking}} features of the mammalian epidermis is its morphological and functional polymorphism. This poses two fundamentally important and closely related problems in the biology of skin: Firstly, to elucidate the mode of origin of the numerous, apparently stable variants or differentia, involving both the superficial epidermis and its appendages and glands, and the intimately associated dermis, from a layer of embryonic skin of apparently uniform constitution; and, secondly, to define the mechanism(s) responsible for the faithful conservation of these regional specificities throughout life. Thanks {{to a variety of}} elegant analyses, conducted primarily upon <b>avian</b> embryonic <b>material,</b> the first problem has been solved, at least in broad outline (1 - 6).

40|$|ABSTRACT. Microbial source {{tracking}} (MST) {{has become}} a focus of some recreational beach moni-toring programs. Suspected sources of contamination include human sewage, agricultural runoff, and feces from wildlife and domestic animals, depending on beach location. Waterfowl have been suggested as a primary source of fecal contamination at many beaches, but techniques to “prove ” contaminating microbes are of avian origin are mostly unsubstantiated. Researchers often rely on bird counts to mea-sure the impact of waterfowl on beach health. Since waterfowl populations at Door County, Wisconsin (USA) beaches are transitory, this study focused on enumeration of <b>avian</b> waste <b>material</b> along beach transects, rather than on once per day “snapshot ” bird counts. Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentration in beach water was not correlated with avian waste counts at the ten beaches studied in 2004 or the 13 stud-ied in 2005 (rural to semi-urban). Bird counts correlated with E. coli concentrations in beach water at 30 % of the sample sites in 2004 and at only one site in 2005. During the 2004 swimming season avian waste counts correlated with bird counts at only one beach {{and there was no}} correlation in 2005. These results indicate that neither avian waste enumeration nor bird counts can successfully be used to predict microbial contamination of recreational water at selected Great Lakes beaches...|$|R

40|$|The {{expansion}} of global poultry production {{has increased the}} need to reduce or control the agents responsible for economic losses, including Salmonella spp. These bacteria are also of public health concern due to their potential to cause food poisoning, and, more recently, due to the antimicrobial resistance presented by these bacteria.

40|$|T H E {{fact that}} viral {{susceptibility}} changes during embryogenesis has {{been pointed out}} by both experimental embryologists and clinical practitioners, not to mention virologists working with <b>avian</b> <b>material.</b> In attempts to find the fundamental factors which make embryonic tissue susceptible or resistant to a given virus, the metabolic and proliferative rate have been considered relevant (Williamson et al, 1953; Robertson et al, 1955; Tondury, 1956). Experience accumulated in studies of the replication of various viruses in tissue culture has taught us that a high metabolic rate and active proliferation may not always enhance viral replication (Ginsberg, 1958). However, {{there seems to be}} justi-fication for the view that an injurious agent leads to more severe tissue damage when it exercises its effect upon actively proliferating tissues than when it does so at the 'resting stage'. In our previous investigations, we studied a tissue interaction system which, by making isolated mouse metanephrogenic mesenchyme differentiate into tubules, also brought in its train resistance to certain viruses (Saxen et al., 1962, 1963; Vainio et al, 1963 a, b, c). If metabolic activity and proliferation rate have some bearing on viral susceptibility, then the system employed in these studies should offer some advantages in demonstrating this. Con-sequently we have examined the distribution of alkaline phosphatase, since several recent studies indicate a correlation between this group of enzymes and tissue interactions in embryonic organs. Furthermore, by studying the in-corporation of 3 H-thymidine, using autoradiography, an estimate has been made of the proliferation rate of the tissues active in tubule formation...|$|E
40|$|The class Aves, an {{interesting}} but difficult field of research, still remains {{closed for the}} most part to cytologists, who have already succeeded in the Reptilia, the sister class to the Sauropsida, in grasp-ing the exact knowledge of chromosome morphology. Even in domestic fowls, on which more than twenty investigators have hitherto undertaken studies to explore what characteristics exist in the chromosomes, we still find many unsolved points, not absolutely reconciled in the results of their observation. Turning to the other kinds of birds, it is to be noted that the studies have chiefly been extended to the birds at least partly domesticated under confinement, such as species of pheasants and ducks, and seldom to species of wild birds, due probably to the difficulty of obtaining materials suitable for cytological studies. Under such circumstances it is really a matter of importance to collect exact data from some other kinds of birds than domestic fowls and ducks in order to elaborate the present incomplete know-ledge on Avian chromosomes.

40|$|Common Ravens (Corvus corax L.) {{have been}} implicated as {{significant}} predators on the eggs of waterfowl and shorebirds on Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. Malheur Refuge, located in southeastern Oregon {{on the northern}} edge of the Great Basin, {{is one of the largest}} waterfowl refuges in the United States and is an important breeding area for waterfowl. In order to provide fundamental information on which a sound raven management plan could be based, research was conducted from 1975 - 1977 on aspects of population density, brood phenology, nesting success, seasonal use of the study area, roosting behavior, and food habits of ravens on and near the refuge. Nesting density was determined to be one pair per approximately 25 km 2. Most nests occurred in rimrocks, but trees and abandoned human structures were also used. Investigation of 87 nests revealed that the incubation period was 21 + 1 days. Incubation began with the laying of the first egg; hatching was asynchronous. Nesting period was 41 + 3 days. An original method of age-classing ravens is described. A total of 266 ravens was marked with patagial tags. Observation of marked individuals as far as 480 km from the study area suggests considerable mobility in the population. Population numbers vary seasonally, peaking in the winter. The Harney Basin is the location of an exceptionally large winter roost for ravens. Analysis of food remains, collected from 34 nests, indicates that ravens have varied diets and that there are significant differences in the diets of ravens nesting in different habitats. A correlation exists between the proportion of the diet that is <b>avian</b> <b>material</b> and the proximity of the raven nest to waterfowl production areas.

40|$|Edgar Allen was {{probably}} the first to suspect tha-t the ovarian follicular hormone, which he had found to be an estrogenic agent in mammals, might have a feminizing effect on the plumage of birds. About {{a year after the}} appearance of the first paper by Allen and Doisy ' on extraction of the follicular hormone of the pig, Allen with his collaborators reported 2 that an estrogenic substance could likewise be extracted from small and medium-sized follicles in the ovary of the hen. He thus demonstrated to his own satisfaction the nonspecficity of the substance, and it seemed to him natural to expect that the distinctive secondary sexual characteristics of the female bird would prove to be under the control of this ovarian follicular hormone. Dr. Allen did not himself pursue this phase of the problem, but he followed developments in the field with an appreciative interest. As soon as the hormone became availalble in adequate amounts he sent a quantity of it to the writer with a request that tests be made on proper <b>avian</b> <b>material.</b> The substance, which had been taken up in corn oil, was low in effective units and, as was learned later, even the maximum amounts used were far too small to be effective on the plumage of birds. Consequendy, no positive results were obtained at that time. But a few years later Allen's early inference was fully justified by the entirely independent work of Juhn and Gustavson," 2 who first showed unequivocally that the hormone obtained from the liquor folliculi of mammals is capable of producing feminizing effects on the plumage of the common fowl. This discovery provided a new and convenient technic for verifying and extending the findings of many previous workers and it quickly became well established that the regenerating plumage of the male, the capon, or the ovariectomized female could be rendered more or less completely female in type by the injection of adequate amounts of follicular hormone during early stages of feather growth. Since female plumage is less conspicuous than is that of the male o...|$|E
40|$|Avian {{influenza}} (Al), or bird flu, {{is caused}} by avian influenza viruses that are carried by wild waterfowl and shed in the saliva, nasal excrements and feces. Domestic poultry get the disease {{when they come in}} contact with the viruses either directly from waterfowl (drinking from contaminated water, foraging in places where waterfowl have been), or from contact with other infected domestic birds, cages, feed, feces or workers that may be carrying the virus on their clothes or vehicles. It can also be spread easily with wind currents, therefore, the less birds are moved, especially off-site, the better. Static pile composting provides a tool to manage the birds on site, reducing the risk of spreading disease. CWMI, in collaboration with New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Department of Agriculture and Markets and the Workplace Health and Safety Programs in the New York State College of Industrial and Labor Relations, developed and disseminated educational materials for a composting component of a state emergency response plan for <b>avian</b> influenza. <b>Materials</b> that were developed include a literature review of Al and methods of disposal of affected poultry, a 12 page illustrated fact sheet ([URL] and poster entitled Natural Rendering: Composting Poultry Mortality and a 6 -minute video ([URL] that provide technical assistance for routine mortality and for emergency situations.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Determinar la asociación entre la zona urbana de origen del paciente en la ciudad de México y la prevalencia de neumonitis por hipersensibilidad inducida por antígeno aviario. MATERIAL Y MÉTODOS: Se trata de un estudio de casos y controles realizado en el Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias, en la ciudad de México, en el año de 1999. Se estudiaron 109 casos con neumonitis por hipersensibilidad y 184 controles: de éstos, 39, con {{fibrosis}} pulmonar idiopática; 63, con tuberculosis pulmonar, y 82, con asma. La ciudad de México y las zonas conurbadas se dividieron en cinco zonas geográficas: centro, noreste, sureste, noroeste y el suroeste. Se calcularon las prevalencias de las diferentes enfermedades por zona urbana de los pacientes que participaron en el estudio; como medida de asociación, se estimó la razón de momios, con un intervalo de confianza al 95 %. Asimismo, se realizó regresión logística múltiple ajustando por edad, sexo y estrato socioeconómico. RESULTADOS: Ochenta casos de neumonitis por hipersensibilidad se concentraron en el sur del noreste de las zonas conurbadas y la parte norte del sureste de la ciudad de México, 48 y 32, respectivamente (RM= 3. 86, IC 95 % 2. 17 - 6. 96). Treinta y seis controles de asma se localizaron en el suroeste de la ciudad de México, zona donde se ubica el Intituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias (p OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate the}} association between the urban area of origin of patients and the prevalence of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), induced by <b>avian</b> antigens. <b>MATERIAL</b> AND METHODS: A case-control {{study was conducted in}} 1999 at the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (NIRD). Cases were 109 consecutive HP patients and controls were 184 patients: 39 with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 63 with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), and 82 with asthma. Mexico City and surrounding counties (SC) were divided into 5 geographical areas: 1) Downtown; 2) North-East (NE); 3) South-East (SE); 4) North-West (NW) and 5) South-West (SW). Statistical analysis consisted of calculation of disease prevalence by urban area; associations were assessed with odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals. Multivariate analysis with multiple logistic regression was performed to adjust for age, gender and socioeconomic level. RESULTS: Eighty HP cases were located in the NE southernmost and SE northernmost areas of Mexico City (48 and 32, respectively) (OR= 3. 86; 95 % CI 2. 17 - 6. 96). Thirty-six controls with asthma came from the SW area, (where NIRD is located) (p< 0. 05), and four from SC. Controls with PTB and IPF were scattered throughout the study area.

40|$|AbstractBone is {{a dynamic}} tissue which is {{continuously}} adapting not only to external mechanical stimuli but also to internal metabolic calcium demands. During normal bone remodeling, bone-resorbing osteoclasts release calcium from the bone and digest the collagenous bone matrix, after which bone-depositing osteoblasts form unmineralized collagen matrix, which subsequently mineralizes. The detailed mechanism by which calcium is deposited {{at the site of}} mineralization and removed from it during bone resorption is largely unknown. Experimental studies are difficult to conduct because in adult bone {{only a small fraction of}} bone tissue is remodeled at any moment in time. Thus, one promising approach is to study mineral deposition and resorption in model systems in which a large fraction of the bone mineral is mobilized in a relatively short period of time. We investigated the microscopic and nanoscopic alterations of avian medullary bone architecture during the egg-laying (oviposition) cycle of hens. Medullary bone forms a labile calcium reservoir for eggshell production and is characterized by an extremely rapid and high-flux calcium metabolism. It thus, provides the unique opportunity to study processes of bone remodeling in their most intensive form. We used a combination of synchrotron X-ray tomography together with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) to correlate microscopic medullary bone attributes such as the mineral content, medullary bone volume fraction and medullary bone trabecular thickness with nanoscopic alterations in the mineral particle size (thickness parameter T and length parameter L) during the oviposition cycle. To identify the timing of the different stages of the cycle, ionic calcium, phosphorus and PTH concentrations in the blood of the layers were monitored. We found that the microscopic and nanoscopic architecture of <b>avian</b> medullary bone <b>material</b> changes rapidly during the oviposition cycle. During eggshell calcification, the mineral content and the size of trabeculae of medullary bone decrease markedly. Furthermore, the average mineral particle size increases during resorption, suggesting that the smaller mineral particles are preferrentially removed. Medullary bone thus formes a fast-responding system exhibiting rapid alterations of the material at the micron and nano scale. Those mechanisms are crucial to provide calcium for the high metabolic calcium demand during eggshell mineralization...|$|R
40|$|Rodenticide use in {{agriculture}} {{can lead to}} the secondary poisoning of avian predators. Currently the Australian sugarcane industry has two rodenticides, Racumin® and Rattoff®, available for in-crop use but, like many agricultural industries, it lacks an ecologically-based method of determining the potential secondary poisoning risk the use of these rodenticides poses to <b>avian</b> predators. The <b>material</b> presented in this thesis addresses this by: a. determining where predator/prey interactions take place in sugar producing districts; b. quantifying the amount of rodenticide available to avian predators and the probability of encounter; and c. developing a stochastic model that allows secondary poisoning risk under various rodenticide application scenarios to be investigated. Results demonstrate that predator/prey interactions are highly constrained by environmental structure. Rodents used crops that provided high levels of canopy cover and therefore predator protection and poorly utilised open canopy areas. In contrast, raptors over-utilised areas with low canopy cover and low rodent densities, but which provided high accessibility to prey. Given this pattern of habitat use, and that industry baiting protocols preclude rodenticide application in open canopy crops, these results indicate that secondary poisoning can only occur if poisoned rodents leave closed canopy crops and become available for predation in open canopy areas. Results further demonstrate that after in-crop rodenticide application, only a small proportion of rodents available in open areas are poisoned and that these rodents carry low levels of toxicant. Coupled with the low level of rodenticide use in the sugar industry, the high toxic threshold raptors have to these toxicants and the low probability of encountering poisoned rodents, results indicate that the risk of secondary poisoning events occurring is minimal. A stochastic model was developed to investigate the effect of manipulating factors that might influence secondary poisoning hazard in a sugarcane agro-ecosystem. These simulations further suggest that in all but extreme scenarios, the risk of secondary poisoning is also minimal. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that secondary poisoning of avian predators {{associated with the use of}} the currently available rodenticides in Australian sugar producing districts is minimal. Further, the ecologically-based method of assessing secondary poisoning risk developed in this thesis has broader applications in other agricultural systems where rodenticide use may pose risks to avian predators...|$|R
40|$|Oral PresentationsBackground: An avian-origin H 7 N 9 virus {{emerged in}} eastern China in February 2013 {{and has since}} caused 133 {{confirmed}} human infections (Gao R, et al. N Engl J Med. 2013; 368 : 1888 - 1897). We have compared human isolates and avian viruses isolated from epidemiologically linked poultry markets and confirmed that the human infections were caused by direct transmission from a poultry source (Chen Y, et al. Lancet. 2013; 381 : 1916 - 1985). In addition to the Q 226 L substitution in the HA, which may provide virus with some ability to bind to human-type receptors, what other adaptations has this virus gained to make it different from other <b>avian</b> influenza viruses? <b>Materials</b> and Methods: We characterized H 7 N 9 and other related H 7 and N 9 subtype viruses isolated in April 2013 from local poultry markets that were associated with human infections. Genetic mutations, polymerases activity, growth kinetic in mammalian and avian cells and replication ability in mice were determined using reverse genetic versions of H 7 N 9 virus. Results: Replication ability and growth kinetics of the avian H 7 subtype influenza viruses were compared in avian and mammalian cell lines. Our {{data suggest that the}} reassortant H 7 N 9 virus has adapted to, and may have become established in, land-based poultry. It is currently not clear if this virus may still be circulating in some poultry populations, continuing to evolve and posing a threat for further human infections. We studied the virus genome for mammalian adaptation markers by performing sequence analysis on virus isolates and RT-PCR products derived from samples obtained from 46 patients hospitalized in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University Medical School, Hangzhou, China. Virus adaptation markers in the HA, NA and PB 2 genes were analyzed in sequential samples. Multiple adaptation markers were identified in these genes of clinical isolates and serial respiratory samples. Our data showed that the avian-origin H 7 N 9 has attempted to adapt to replicate in human cells using various mechanisms already displayed by other viruses. An in vitro assay showed that viruses with substitutions at these positions exhibit enhanced RNP polymerase activity, and a study of growth kinetics demonstrated that isolates carrying these adaptation markers replicate to a higher titer in mammalian cells. Replication efficiency of these clinical variants was also evaluated in mice. As neuraminidase inhibitors are used as the first line of antiviral drugs for the treatment of H 7 N 9 infection, we also analyzed oseltamivir resistance-associated mutations in the NA genes of viruses shed in either serial nasal swab or sputum specimens obtained from 40 of the hospitalized patients. Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive analysis of avian-origin H 7 N 9 virus from poultry and in human infections. The novel H 7 N 9 virus attempted multiple adaptive strategies for efficient replication in humans. Further characterization of this H 7 N 9 avian influenza virus for understanding the mechanism of replication adaptation and the role in efficient human transmission is necessary. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
