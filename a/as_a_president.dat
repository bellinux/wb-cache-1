5|$|Sinatra {{with a cold}} is Picasso without paint, Ferrari without fuel--only worse. For {{the common}} cold robs Sinatra of that uninsurable jewel, his voice, cutting into {{the core of his}} confidence, and it affects not only his own psyche but also seems to cause a kind of {{psychosomatic}} nasal drip within dozens of people who work for him, drink with him, love him, depend on him for their own welfare and stability. A Sinatra with a cold can, in a small way, send vibrations through the entertainment industry and beyond as surely <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>President</b> of the United States, suddenly sick, can shake the national economy.|$|E

5|$|Ulysses S. Grant (born Hiram Ulysses Grant, April 27, 1822 – July 23, 1885) was a {{prominent}} United States Army general during the American Civil War and Commanding General {{at the conclusion of}} that war. He was elected as the 18th President of the United States in 1868, serving from 1869 to 1877. As Commanding General, Grant worked closely with President Abraham Lincoln to lead the Union Army to victory over the Confederacy. After Lincoln's assassination, Grant's assignment in implementing Reconstruction often put him at odds with President Andrew Johnson, Lincoln's successor. Twice elected president, Grant led the Republicans in their effort to remove the vestiges of Confederate nationalism and slavery, protect African-American citizenship, and support economic prosperity. Grant's presidency has often been criticized for its scandals and for his failure to alleviate the economic depression following the Panic of 1873, but modern scholarship regards him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>president</b> who performed a difficult job with some merit, and took strong action on civil rights for African Americans.|$|E
