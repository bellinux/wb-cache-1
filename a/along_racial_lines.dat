5|$|Thompson {{was sworn}} in as the Masten District City Councilman on January 4, 2001 after being {{appointed}} by the Democratic Committee. His east side district included 27% of Buffalo's African American population. The Buffalo City Council had a brief African-American majority during Thompson's appointed half term that ended following the subsequent elections in September and November 2001. After African-Americans lost their majority the council voted <b>along</b> <b>racial</b> <b>lines</b> by a 76 margin to shrink the common council from thirteen to nine members by eliminating the four at-large positions (three of which were held by African-Americans). The city voters endorsed the proposal by a 35,84919,036 margin which largely went <b>along</b> <b>racial</b> <b>lines.</b> Thompson retained his council position in the 2001, 2003 and 2005 elections. Thompson served as a John Edwards delegate at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the {{population}} of the Congo numbered approximately 12million black people and 30,000 whites. The colonial government segregated the population <b>along</b> <b>racial</b> <b>lines</b> and there was very little mixing between the colours. The white population was highly urbanized and, in Léopoldville, the capital, lived in a quarter of the city separated from the black majority. All blacks in the city had to adhere to a curfew.|$|E
5|$|On September 20, 1994, {{the city}} and the ACLU reached a settlement. The ACLU agreed to drop claims against {{the city and}} Superintendent LeRoy Martin. In return, the city of Chicago agreed to pay Nelson and the ACLU $95,000 (1994, $138,000 in 2008) for damage to the {{painting}} and to issue police procedures about what materials protected by the First Amendment may be seized. The elected officials also agreed not to appeal the district court's ruling. Left unresolved were {{the hundreds of thousands of}} dollars of legal fees owed to lawyers defending Tillman, Rush and Streeter; by September 1994, $200,000 (1994, $292,000 in 2008) in fees were owed by Tillman alone. Earlier in the year, the City Council's Finance Committee voted against paying for the aldermen's legal fees. The vote split <b>along</b> <b>racial</b> <b>lines,</b> 12 to 8.|$|E

5|$|St Hill {{was born}} in Port of Spain, Trinidad in 1904, and {{according}} to the writer C. L. R. James, his family were lower middle-class. His brothers, Wilton and Cyl played cricket for Trinidad; in addition, the former played Test matches for the West Indies. St Hill first played in the Bonanza Cup, Trinidad's main cricket competition, for a club called Durban Cricket Club in 1922; critics judged him to be promising, but he had little success. The following year, he moved to play for Shannon. Cricket in Trinidad at the time was divided <b>along</b> <b>racial</b> <b>lines.</b> Shannon was a club associated with black lower middle-class players such as teachers or clerks. The team contained many strong bowlers, and St Hill opened the bowling.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{stated purpose}} of GRCs was {{to guarantee a}} minimum representation of minorities in Parliament and ensure that {{there would always be}} a multiracial Parliament instead of one made up of a single race. Speaking in Parliament during the debate on whether GRCs should be introduced, First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Goh Chok Tong said he had first discussed the necessity of ensuring the multiracial nature of Parliament with Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in July 1982. Then, Lee had expressed concern about the voting patterns of younger Singaporeans, who appeared to be apathetic to the need of having a racially balanced slate of candidates. He was also worried about more Singaporeans voting <b>along</b> <b>racial</b> <b>lines,</b> which would lead to a lack of minority representation in Parliament.|$|E
25|$|Research {{shows that}} {{segregation}} <b>along</b> <b>racial</b> <b>lines</b> contributes to public goods inequalities. Whites and blacks are vastly {{more likely to}} support different candidates for mayor than whites and blacks in more integrated places, which makes them less able to build consensus. The lack of consensus leads to lower levels of public spending.|$|E

50|$|This {{test was}} used to {{determine}} racial identity in South Africa during the apartheid era, distinguishing whites from coloureds and blacks. The test was partially responsible for splitting existing communities and families <b>along</b> perceived <b>racial</b> <b>lines.</b> Its formal authority ended with the end of apartheid in 1994. It remains an important part of South African cultural heritage and a symbol of racism.|$|R

25|$|The districting {{was forced}} {{by the threat of}} a legal action from a group {{claiming}} that Latino minorities comprising 14 percent of the population had not been adequately represented.

25|$|Some European {{countries}} make {{it illegal}} to collect demographic census information based on ethnicity or ancestry (e.g. France), but some others do query <b>along</b> <b>racial</b> <b>lines</b> (e.g. the UK).

25|$|While hiring {{discrimination}} {{is the most}} highly visible aspect of economic discrimination, it is often the most uncommon. Increasingly strong measures against discrimination have made hiring discrimination {{much more difficult for}} employers to engage in. However this is only the case in formal hiring arrangements, with corporations or others subject to public scrutiny and overview. Private hiring, such as apprenticeships of electricians, plumbers, carpenters, and other trades is almost entirely broken down <b>along</b> <b>racial</b> <b>lines,</b> with almost no women in these fields and most minorities training those of their own race.|$|E

500|$|Biko {{hoped that}} a future socialist South Africa {{could become a}} {{completely}} non-racial society, with people of all ethnic backgrounds living peacefully together in a [...] "joint culture" [...] that combined {{the best of all}} communities. He did not support guarantees of minority rights, believing that doing so would continue to recognise divisions <b>along</b> <b>racial</b> <b>lines.</b> Instead he supported a one person, one vote system. Initially arguing that one-party states were appropriate for Africa, he developed a more positive view of multi-party systems after conversations with Woods. He saw individual liberty as desirable, but regarded it as a lesser priority than access to food, employment, and social security.|$|E
500|$|Small {{was born}} in Princes Town, Trinidad, in 1892. He first played cricket for a club in Trinidad called Stingo, which {{included}} players from the lowest social class. Cricket in Trinidad {{at the time was}} divided <b>along</b> <b>racial</b> <b>lines.</b> For cricket clubs on the island, the colour of a player's skin was crucial. Stingo was described by writer and historian C. L. R. James: [...] "They were plebeians: the butcher, the tailor, the candlestick maker, the casual labourer, with a sprinkling of unemployed. Totally black and of no social status whatever." [...] James described Small as a genial presence on the cricket field: [...] "Small talked to everybody and everybody talked to him: Joe radiated good nature and self-satisfaction." [...] Outside of his cricket career, Small worked for the Stores Department of Trinidad Leaseholds oil company.|$|E
500|$|St Hill {{was born}} on 6 July 1893 in Port of Spain, Trinidad, and {{according}} to C. L. R. James, his family were lower middle-class. He had two brothers who played first-class cricket for Trinidad, Cyl and Edwin; the latter also played Test matches for West Indies. Cricket in Trinidad {{at the time was}} divided <b>along</b> <b>racial</b> <b>lines.</b> For cricket clubs on the island, the colour of a player's skin was crucial. St Hill played for Shannon, a club associated with black lower middle-class players such as teachers or clerks. Another club, Maple, was associated with middle-class people but would only accept men with a lighter skin tone. When someone said to St Hill that Maple would welcome a player as good as him, he replied, [...] "Yes, but they wouldn't want my brothers", both of whom were darker skinned. By 1912, St Hill found a job in a department store and remained in this position all his life. By this stage, he had established a good reputation as a batsman and was popular with players and spectators.|$|E
50|$|Before Namibia's independence, the country's {{education}} system {{was designed to}} reinforce apartheid rather than provide the necessary human resource base to promote equitable social and economic development.

500|$|Three {{proposals}} for minority representation in Parliament {{had been considered}} by a 1966 Constitutional Commission chaired by the Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin. The first {{was to have a}} committee of representatives of minorities that would elect three persons from amongst its members to represent minorities in Parliament. However, this was rejected as the Commission felt that it would be an inappropriate and retrogressive move in that unelected members {{should not be allowed to}} dilute the elected chamber. The second proposal, which was to have proportional representation, was also rejected on the grounds that it would intensify party politics <b>along</b> <b>racial</b> <b>lines</b> and eventually [...] "perpetuate and accentuate racial differences". This would then make it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to achieve a single homogeneous community out of the many races that form the population of the Republic. The third proposal was to have an upper house in Parliament composed of members elected or nominated to represent the racial, linguistic and religious minorities in Singapore. However, this was rejected as being backward-looking since politicians should attain a seat in Parliament through taking part in elections.|$|E

50|$|More left-leaning Indian {{leaders and}} intellectuals, such as C.V. Devan Nair and James Puthucheary {{initially}} supported more radically left-wing groups. They had been imprisoned by the British for their radical union activism. Later, {{some of these}} men join the more moderate wing of the PAP. Devan Nair went on to build the modern trades union movement in Singapore, the National Trades Union Congress. Consequently, Indians in Singapore tended to align themselves, both individually and as groups, with parties advocating specific political or economic ideologies, rather than <b>along</b> purely <b>racial</b> <b>lines.</b> This basic difference between the Indian communities of Singapore and Malaysia has endured to the present day.|$|R
25|$|Another {{theory on}} {{cultural}} assimilation {{centers on the}} racial/ethnic disadvantage model. This theory emphasizes {{that the process of}} assimilation for certain immigrant groups is blocked due to their race or ethnicity, meaning that discrimination in society and in the workplace hinders assimilation into mainstream U.S. society. The major critique of this theory is that it overstresses social barriers <b>along</b> <b>racial</b> and ethnic <b>lines</b> without providing adequate explanations for why many second-generation immigrants overcome these barriers and experience socioeconomic mobility.|$|R
50|$|A Belgian {{census of}} 1933 {{led to the}} {{measurement}} and the classification of the population <b>along</b> <b>racial</b> and ethnic <b>lines.</b> Tutsis were given access to the best education at the prestigious Astrida Secondary School and groomed for colonial administrative jobs, ethnic tensions grew as a result.

2500|$|As {{late as the}} 1950s {{the policy}} of 'colorblind' access and mixing of races did not extend to all of Portugal's African territories, {{particularly}} Mozambique, where in tune with other minority white regimes {{of the day in}} southern Africa, the territory was segregated <b>along</b> <b>racial</b> <b>lines.</b> [...] Strict qualification criteria ensured that less than one per cent of black Mozambicans became full Portuguese citizens.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was hoped}} that by {{providing}} the Chinese with such facilities, they would be converted from [...] "reservoirs of resentment into bastions of loyal Malayan citizenry".
