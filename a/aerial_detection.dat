The terrain of central and southern France with its forests, mountains, and shrubland were ideal for hiding and unless the authorities were prepared to commit thousands of men to hunt the maquis down, it was quite possible to evade authority in this landscape. The Germans simply did not have the spare men-power for such operations and instead sent spotter planes to find the maquis, who provided that they were careful about concealing their fires could usually avoid <b>aerial</b> <b>detection.</b> The only other way of breaking up the maquis bands was to send in a spy, which was highly dangerous work as the maquisards would summarily execute any infiltrator working for the Germans or Vichy who was exposed. Joining the young men fleeing the service with the STO were others targeted by the Reich like Jews, Spanish Republican refugees, and Allied airmen shot down over France. One maquis band in the Cévennes region consisted of German communists who had fought in the Spanish Civil War who fled to France in 1939. A striking aspect of the maquis was unlike the urban-based resistance groups that emerged in 1940-42 who took political names like Combat, Liberté or Libération, the maquis bands chose apolitical names like the names of animals such as Ours, Loup, Tigre, Lion, Puma, Rhinocéros and Eléphant; or names of people like the Maquis Bernard, the Maquis Socrate, the Maquis Henri Bourgogne; or one maquis band whose leader was a doctor, hence the name Maquis le Doc.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel <b>aerial</b> building <b>detection</b> method based on region orientation {{as a new}} feature, which is used in various steps throughout the presented framework. As building objects {{are expected to be}} connected with each other on a regional level, exploiting the main orientation obtained from the local gradient analysis provides further information for detection purposes. The orientation information is applied for an improved edge map design, which is integrated with classical features like shadow and color. Moreover, an orthogonality check is introduced for finding building candidates, and their final shapes defined by the Chan-Vese active contour algorithm are refined based on the orientation information, resulting in smooth and accurate building outlines. The proposed framework is evaluated on multiple data sets, including aerial and high resolution optical satellite images, and compared to six state-of-the-art methods in both object and pixel level evaluation, proving the algorithm's efficiency. © 2015 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.
