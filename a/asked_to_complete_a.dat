5|$|The host {{city for}} an Olympic Games is usually chosen {{seven to eight}} years ahead of their celebration. The process of {{selection}} is carried out in two phases that span a two-year period. The prospective host city applies to its country's National Olympic Committee; if more than one city from the same country submits a proposal to its NOC, the national committee typically holds an internal selection, since only one city per NOC can {{be presented to the}} International Olympic Committee for consideration. Once the deadline for submission of proposals by the NOCs is reached, the first phase (Application) begins with the applicant cities <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> <b>a</b> questionnaire regarding several key criteria related to the organisation of the Olympic Games. In this form, the applicants must give assurances that they will comply with the Olympic Charter and with any other regulations established by the IOC Executive Committee. The evaluation of the filled questionnaires by a specialised group provides the IOC with an overview of each applicant's project and their potential to host the Games. On the basis of this technical evaluation, the IOC Executive Board selects the applicants that will proceed to the candidature stage.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} each show (starting July 8), Eric was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> <b>a</b> {{task that}} America {{specified}} by voting on CBS.com or by text messaging. For every five tasks Eric completed, he was rewarded with $10,000 (USD). Viewers were able to vote on tasks from the end of an episode until midnight Pacific Time. The Thursday task involved pitching nominees to the Head of Household (HoH), the Sunday task was something interesting that might not affect the strategic game play, and the Tuesday task was swaying the opinion of the other HouseGuests on who to evict (unless it is he who is nominated). Once Eric received the task, he had to make a meaningful effort to complete the task. However, he could have decided how to complete the task. In addition, Eric cast his eviction vote for whom America chose to evict. Eric was a jury member on finale night, and the viewers voted that Dick should receive Eric's vote to win the game.|$|E

2500|$|Priming {{can occur}} {{following}} [...] perceptual, semantic, or [...] stimulus repetition. For example, {{if a person}} reads a list of words including the word table, and is later <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> <b>a</b> word starting with tab, the probability {{that he or she}} will answer table is greater than if they are not primed. Another example is if people see an incomplete sketch they are unable to identify and they are shown more of the sketch until they recognize the picture, later they will identify the sketch at an earlier stage than was possible for them the first time.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, a {{longitudinal}} study conducted in Japan assessed possible long-term effects of video game playing in children. The final analysis consisted of 591 fifth graders aged 10–11 across eight public elementary schools, and was conducted {{over the course of}} a year. [...] Initially, children were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> <b>a</b> survey which assessed presence or absence of violence in the children's favorite video games, as well as video game context variables that may affect the results and the aggression levels of the children. [...] Children were assessed again for these variables a year later. [...] Results reveal that there is a significant difference in gender, with boys showing significantly more aggressive behavior and anger than girls, which was attributed by the authors to boys elevated interest in violent video games. [...] However the interaction between time spent gaming and preference for violent games was associated with reduced aggression in boys but not girls. [...] The researchers also found that eight context variables they assessed increased aggression, including unjustified violence, availability of weapons, and rewards. Three context variables, role-playing, extent of violence, and humor, were associated with decreased aggression. [...] It is unknown if the observed changes from the two surveys are actually contextual effects. [...] The researchers found that the context and quality of the violence in video games affects children more than simply presence and amount of violence, and these effects are different from child to child.|$|E
