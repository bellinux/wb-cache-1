40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Master’s thesis is to study rules {{limiting}} deductibility of interest in taxation with related corporations by comparing rules in Finland and Russia and focusing on recharacterization of debt to equity or interest to dividend. Generally, {{there is a wide}} deductibility of interest in business taxation both in Finland and Russia. However, both countries have adopted specific rules limiting deductibility of interest in taxation. In addition to specific rules, both countries may recharterize debt to equity based on general anti avoidance rules. Russia has implemented its thin capitalization rules in 2002 when it has adopted traditional rules where interest deductibility is limited based on debt/equity ratio 3 : 1. Debt from related party exceeding the amount is classified as dividend. Historically, non discrimination clauses in double tax treaties concluded by Russia have limited the effectiveness of the rule. In addition, the related party definition has also been limited to cover only direct parent company. In newer case law it has been possible to apply the rules dispite the general non discrimination clauses. Also the concept of unreasonable tax benefit as anti avoidance doctrine has been applied more widely and all the related parties are now covered by the rules. This has caused legal uncertainty as taxpayers have limited certainty on expected outcomes of new Russian court cases. Finland has historically has no direct thin capitalization rules and it has applied quite strictly form over substance principle for defining what is debt and what is equity. General anti <b>avoidance</b> <b>clause</b> has been applied historically very rarely in case law, until a new landmark case was publish by the SAC 2016 : 72. This could lead to longstanding disputes between tax administration and taxpayers and therefore serious uncertainty may prevail for a number of years. Finland adopted specific rules regarding the limitation of interest deduction based per centage of EBITDA concept so that these rules were first time applied in 2014. Only 25 % of adjusted taxable EBITDA is deductible. However, there is significant group ratio exemption for the application of the rules (ie. if debt/equity ratio in a single company is lower than group’s similar ratio the rules do not apply). The rule is very similar to OECD BEPS report (10 / 2015) as best practice. However, {{there is a need to}} adjust Finnish rules based on EU Anti Tax Avoidance Directive (7 / 2016) by 2019. Also external interests and real estate companies needs to covered under limitation rules by then. Overall, Finland and Russia have selected different, but both OECD BEPS compatible ways to limit the tax deductibility of interest. However, in both countries there is clear uncertainty how far general anti-avoidance clauses can be applied, which may reduce the attractiveness of these countries as investment targets...|$|E

40|$|The {{viability}} {{of international law}} rests largely on the {{viability of}} treaties {{as a source of}} law. In {{the second half of the}} twentieth century, the international state system was supported by the development of treaties. States focused the majority of their regime-building efforts on three sets of concerns: restraining interstate conflict, securing human rights, and managing the economic system. States used treaties as the primary tool in the construction of these international institutions and in the codification of these norms. Moreover, treaties shift issues from the political arena into a juridical, rule-based, forum. The very success of treaties as a policy tool has caused a new dilemma: a surfeit of treaties that often overlap and, with increasing frequency, conflict with one another. For the treaty partners of states that have adopted conflicting treaties, this results in a lack of certainty as to which-if either-treaty would be honored. After the successes of the last fifty years, international law may become increasingly dysfunctional in the first decades of the twenty-first century due to the sheer number of these treaties and the lack of useful, principled, methods to resolve conflicts between them. This Article addresses a particular cause of fragmentation—unresolved conflicts between treaties—and considers how lawyers and policymakers may respond to the challenges posed by treaty proliferation and conflict. I argue that treaty conflicts are a key underlying cause of fragmentation and that the current rules are inadequate to provide clear, systematic solutions to treaty conflicts. This Article proceeds in five parts. Part I describes treaty conflicts in terms of the subject-matter and the structure of the treaties. Part II considers techniques of resolving treaty conflicts as alternatives to application of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT). Strategies include the drafting of clauses to avoid potential conflicts and the use of interpretive techniques to analyze texts that have already been written. Part III turns to the codification of conflict resolution rules in the VCLT and considers their strengths and weaknesses. Part IV analogizes from other types of textual conflicts, such as conflicts between contracts or between statutes. Part V draws from the previous sections to suggest options in addressing treaty conflicts, including: (a) ending the 2 ̆ 2 same subject-matter 2 ̆ 2 rule in assessing whether or not treaties conflict and in the application of conflict resolution rules; (b) increasing the use of purposive interpretation to assess and resolve treaty conflicts; (c) drafting more detailed conflict <b>avoidance</b> <b>clauses</b> in treaties; and (d) increasing the use of a procedure of assurance to determine the intention of a state that has ratified conflicting treaties. While there is no single solution to this complex dilemma, there are ways to minimize some of the unwanted effects of the proliferation of treaties. Part V also broadens the focus from these specific recommendations and considers the implications of the preceding discussion on the status of international law as a coherent legal system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Financial {{conflicts}} of interest (fCOI) can introduce actions that bias clinical trial results and reduce their objectivity. We obtained information from investigators about adherence to practices that minimize the introduction of such bias in their clinical trials experience. Methods Email survey of clinical trial investigators from Canadian sites to learn about adherence to practices that help maintain research independence across all stages of trial preparation, conduct, and dissemination. The main outcome was the proportion of investigators that reported full adherence to preferred trial practices for all of their trials conducted from 2001 - 2006, stratified by funding source. Results 844 investigators responded (76 %) and 732 (66 %) provided useful information. Full adherence to preferred clinical trial practices was highest for institutional review of signed contracts and budgets (82 % and 75 % of investigators respectively). Lower rates of full adherence were reported for the other two practices in the trial preparation stage (<b>avoidance</b> of confidentiality <b>clauses,</b> 12 %; trial registration after 2005, 39 %). Lower rates of full adherence were reported for 7 practices in the trial conduct (35 % to 43 %) and dissemination (53 % to 64 %) stages, particularly in industry funded trials. 269 investigators personally experienced (n = 85) or witnessed (n = 236) a fCOI; over 70 % of these situations related to industry trials. Conclusion Full adherence to practices designed to promote the objectivity of research varied across trial stages and was low overall, particularly for industry funded trials. </p...|$|R
