We will assume that, before harvesting, the resident class has a small probability γ of reproducing <b>as</b> <b>a</b> small <b>adult</b> because the fecundity f_ 3 of a fish that first reproduces <b>as</b> <b>a</b> large <b>adult</b> is appreciably greater than the fecundities f_ 2 and f̃_ 3 of a fish that first reproduces <b>as</b> <b>a</b> small <b>adult.</b> We also assume that the variant class has a probability γ^'> γ of reproducing <b>as</b> <b>a</b> small <b>adult.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{jury found}} Bell guilty, and {{he faced the}} {{possibility}} of up to 22years in prison. The judge scheduled sentencing for September 20, 2007. Bell's new defense attorneys, Bob Noel, Walter Lee Perkins Jr., Peggy Sullivan, Louis Scott and Carol Powell-Lexing, requested a new trial {{on the grounds that}} Bell should not have been tried <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult.</b> A request to lower Bell's $90,000bond was denied on August 24, 2007, due to his juvenile record. Bell had been put on probation for a battery that occurred December 25, 2005. While on probation, he was convicted of another battery charge and two charges of criminal damage to property. One of the battery charges was reportedly for punching a 17-year-old girl in the face. The media had initially reported that Bell had no prior criminal record. On September 4, 2007, Judge Mauffray vacated the conspiracy conviction on the grounds that Bell should have been tried as a juvenile, but he let the battery conviction stand. Bell appealed his conviction, principally on the ground that he had been improperly tried <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult.</b> On September 14, 2007, Louisiana's Third Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Bell's battery conviction, agreeing that this remaining charge was not among those for which a juvenile may be tried <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>adult.</b>|$|E

40|$|To {{systematically}} examine infant {{size and}} growth, {{according to the}} 2006 WHO infant growth standards, as risk factors for overweight status in young adulthood in a historical cohort. Specifically, to assess: Whether accounting for length (weight-for-length) provides a different picture of risk than weight-for-age, intervals of rapid growth in both weight-for-age and weight-for-length metrics, and what particular target ages for infant size and intervals of rapid growth associate most strongly with overweight <b>as</b> <b>a</b> young <b>adult.</b> Data analysis of 422 appropriate for gestational age white singleton infants enrolled in the Fels Longitudinal Study. Odds ratios (OR) for overweight and obesity in young adulthood (age 20 - 29) were calculated using logistic regression models for the metrics at each target age (0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24 months) comparing ≥ 85 (th) v. < 85 (th) percentile, as well as rapid growth (Δ≥ 0. 67 Z-score) through target age intervals. Models accounted for both maternal and paternal BMI. Infants ≥ 85 (th) percentile of weight-for-age at each target age (except 3 months) had a greater odds of being overweight <b>as</b> <b>a</b> young <b>adult.</b> After accounting for length (weight-for-length) this association was limited to 12, and 18 months. Rapid weight-for-age growth was infrequently associated with overweight <b>as</b> <b>a</b> young <b>adult.</b> Rapid weight-for-length growth from 0 to 24 months, 1 to 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months and from 3 to 9, 12, 18, and 24 months was strongly associated with overweight status <b>as</b> <b>a</b> young <b>adult.</b> The WHO weight-for-length metric associates differently with risk of being overweight <b>as</b> <b>a</b> young <b>adult</b> compared to weight-for-age. Intervals of rapid weight-for-length growth ranging from months (0 - 24), (1 - 12, 18, and 24) and (3 - 9, and 12) displayed the largest OR for being overweight <b>as</b> <b>a</b> young <b>adult...</b>|$|R
