5|$|Common herbs such as sage, mustard, {{and parsley}} were grown {{and used in}} cooking all over Europe, as were caraway, mint, dill <b>and</b> <b>fennel.</b> Many of these plants grew {{throughout}} all of Europe or were cultivated in gardens, and were a cheaper alternative to exotic spices. Mustard was particularly popular with meat products and was described by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) as poor man's food. While locally grown herbs were less prestigious than spices, they were still used in upper-class food, but were then usually less prominent or included merely as coloring. Anise was used to flavor fish and chicken dishes, and its seeds were served as sugar-coated comfits.|$|E

25|$|DES {{belongs to}} the stilbestrol (4,4'-dihydroxystilbene) group of compounds. It is a nonsteroidal open-ring {{analogue}} of the steroidal estrogen estradiol. DES {{was derived from the}} naturally occurring compound anethole, a weakly estrogenic constituent of anise <b>and</b> <b>fennel.</b> Anethole was demethylated to form anol and anol then spontaneously dimerized into dianol and hexestrol, with DES subsequently being synthesized via structural modification of hexestrol. It has been determined via X-ray crystallography that the molecular dimensions of DES are almost identical to those of estradiol, particularly in regards to the distance between the hydroxyl groups {{at either end of the}} molecules.|$|E
25|$|The first clear {{evidence}} of absinthe in the modern sense of a distilled spirit containing green anise <b>and</b> <b>fennel,</b> however, dates to the 18th century. According to popular legend, absinthe began as an all-purpose patent remedy created by Dr. Pierre Ordinaire, a French doctor living in Couvet, Switzerland, around 1792 (the exact date varies by account). Ordinaire's recipe was {{passed on to the}} Henriod sisters of Couvet, who sold absinthe as a medicinal elixir. By other accounts, the Henriod sisters may have been making the elixir before Ordinaire's arrival. In either case, a certain Major Dubied acquired the formula from the sisters and in 1797, and with his son Marcellin and son-in-law Henry-Louis Pernod, opened the first absinthe distillery, Dubied Père et Fils, in Couvet. In 1805, they built a second distillery in Pontarlier, France, under the new company name Maison Pernod Fils. Pernod Fils remained {{one of the most popular}} brands of absinthe up until the drink was banned in France in 1914.|$|E

25|$|Over 30 {{different}} grapes {{varieties are}} {{grown in the}} Friuli-Venezia Giulia including international varieties such as Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot {{as well as local}} varieties like Refosco dal peduncolo rosso, Schioppettino, Friulano, Ribolla gialla and Verduzzo. Of the local varieties, Friulano is the most well known and important variety, producing crisp, floral wines that develop notes of nuts <b>and</b> <b>fennel</b> as it ages. The grape was widely known as Tocai Friulano but in 2006 the European Union banned names that have some similarity or association with the Hungarian wine Tokaji. Now Tocai Friulano is called Friulano. The very acidic Ribolla gialla grape was primarily used as a blending component until winemakers started to apply the techniques used with Chardonnay (such as malolactic fermentation) to produce softer, more buttery wines that still retain the crisp, lemon edge of the grape. Wines made from Verduzzo have peach and nutty flavors in their youth but develop more honeyed flavors as the wine ages. The high acidity of the grape works well in sweet production and in regions like Ramandolo it is often dried to make a passito wine. The Picolit grape also does well in sweet wines where it can produce elegant, floral wines that have a dry finish. In contrast to the thin, sometimes bland Pinot grigio produced {{in other parts of the}} Tre-Venezie, well made examples of Friuli Pinot grigio are known for their fuller body and delicate peach, almond and green apple flavors. Sauvignon blancs are made in a style reminiscent of Sancerre with smoke, herbs and elements of honey and hazelnut. Some of the most expensive Friuli wines are made from the Picolit grape which is prone to grape diseases and mutations which cause the vine to lose its flowers and grape clusters. In most years, less than half of a vineyard Picolit crop will survive and be able to make wine. The light, honeyed dessert wine that it can produce is often in high demand because of restricted supply.|$|E
500|$|Piperatorium is {{generally}} translated as pepper-pot, {{and black pepper}} is considered the most likely condiment these were used for. Pepper {{is only one of}} a number of expensive, high-status spices which these vessels might have dispensed, however. The piperatoria are rare examples of this type of Roman silverware, and according to Johns the Hoxne finds have [...] "significantly expanded the date range, the typology and the iconographic scope of the type". The trade and use of pepper in this period has been supported with evidence of mineralized black pepper at three Northern Province sites recovered in the 1990s, and from the Vindolanda tablets which record the purchase of an unspecified quantity of pepper for two denarii. Archaeological sites with contemporary finds have revealed spices, including coriander, poppy, celery, dill, summer savory, mustard, <b>and</b> <b>fennel.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effects of mycorrhiza symbiosis and different nitrogen levels on yield, yield components and essential oil content <b>and</b> yield of <b>fennel</b> (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) and ajowan (Carum copticum L.), a field experiment was arranged in a factoriel based on a randomized complete block design with three replications at the Agricultural Research Station, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad during growing season 2009 - 2010. The first and the second factors were inoculation with mycorrhiza (with and without inoculation) and nitrogen levels as Urea (0, 50 and 100 kg. ha- 1), respectively. Inculated soil with 200 g mycorrhiza (Glomus intraradaices) was applied at planting time. Urea was used in two stages such as plating time and one month after that. Ceriteria such as yield components (including number of branch, umbel, umbellet, seed and seed weight), biological and seed yield, harvest index and essential oil content <b>and</b> yield of <b>fennel</b> <b>and</b> ajowan were measured. Results showed that yield components, seed yield, biological yield, harvest index, essential oil content <b>and</b> yield of <b>fennel</b> <b>and</b> ajowan were affected by mycorrhiza and nitrogen level. Mycorrhiza increased <b>fennel</b> <b>and</b> ajowan seed yield (with 35 and 85 %, respectively) and essential oil content (with 34 and 30 %, respectively). The highest and the lowest 1000 -seed weight of <b>fennel</b> <b>and</b> ajowan obsevered in inoculation (2. 9 and 0. 3 g) and control (2. 1 and 0. 2 g), respectively. Nitrogen improved all growth characteristics and decreased essential oil content. There were not significant differences between mycorrhiza and nitrogen interaction. Inoculation with mycorrhiza enhanced root development and hence availability of nutrients, particularly phosphorus. Also, nitrogen {{is the cause of}} increasement of photosynthesis rate and duration which promote growth and yield, but it declined essential oil content of two species...|$|R
