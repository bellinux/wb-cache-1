40|$|Much of the {{interstellar}} medium in disk galaxies {{is in the form}} of neutral atomic hydrogen, H I. This gas can be in thermal equilibrium at relatively low temperatures, T < ∼ 300 K (the cold neutral medium, or CNM) or at temperatures somewhat less than 10 4 K (the warm neutral medium, or WNM). These two phases can coexist over a narrow range of pressures, Pmin ≤ P ≤ Pmax. We determine Pmin and Pmax in the plane of the Galaxy as a function of Galactocentric radius R using recent determinations of the gas heating rate and the gas phase abundances of interstellar gas. We provide an analytic approximation for Pmin as a function of metallicity, far-ultraviolet radiation field, and the ionization rate – 2 – of <b>atomic</b> hydrogen. Our <b>analytic</b> results show that the existence of Pmin, or the possibility of a two-phase equilibrium, generally requires that H + exceed C + in abundance at Pmin. The abundance of H + is set by EUV/soft X-ray photoionization and by recombination with negatively charged PAHs.

40|$|Rhetoric and {{composition}} studies, {{as a field}} that used {{to focus on the}} 2 ̆ 2 Western tradition 2 ̆ 2 of rhetoric and writing instruction, has been slowly yet steadily trying to incorporate comparative perspectives. My dissertation targets the intersection of two areas that cry out for scholarly inquiry: comparative research on writing instruction and argumentative/persuasive writing pedagogies in secondary schools. I conduct a comparative analysis of the key concepts and directives in the units on persuasive writing/yilunwen [expository argumentation] in widely used language arts textbooks in the U. S. (Writer 2 ̆ 7 s Choice) and Mainland China (Yuwen). Two sets of research questions are posed: descriptive and analytic. The descriptive questions are directed toward what is explicit in these textbooks, namely about concepts and directives essential to the teaching of written argumentation, such as the definition of the genre, suggestions for organizational strategies, and logic/reasoning, etc. The <b>analytic</b> questions <b>probe</b> the rhetorical traditions that drive the concepts and directives. ^ By mapping the historical context for written argumentation instruction as a school genre at the secondary level in the U. S. and China, with a focus on the 20 th century and thereafter, I identify the hybrid nature of the school genre shaped by the complex social, theoretical, and curricular factors. Then I compare and contrast the key concepts and directives for written argumentation instruction in the textbooks. The key concepts and directives in Writer 2 ̆ 7 s Choice can be traced to Aristotelian rhetoric and Alexander Bain 2 ̆ 7 s 1866 influential English composition manual, and those in Yuwen can be traced to traditional Chinese rhetoric and dialectical materialism. Some focal points, such as purpose, the relationship between philosophy and rhetoric, logic, the place of emotion, and perceptions of the writer and the audience are compared and contrasted. Finally I discuss the implications of the findings for rethinking written argumentation instruction in the 21 st century, calling for coupling of formal logic and dialectical logic and reconsidering the place of emotion. ...|$|R
40|$|Split {{numerical}} {{methods have}} been commonly used in computational physics for many years due to their speed, simplicity, and the accessibility of shock capturing methods in one-dimension. For a variety of reasons, it has been challenging to determine just how accurate operator split methods are, especially {{in the presence of}} curved wave features. One of these difficulties has been the lack of multidimensional shock capturing methods. Another is the difficulty of mathematical analysis of dis-continuous flow phenomena. Also, computational studies have been limited {{due to a lack of}} multidimensional model problems with <b>analytic</b> solutions that <b>probe</b> the nonlinear features of the flow equations. However, a new genuinely unsplit numerical method has been invented. With the advent of the Space-Time Conservation Element/Solution Element (CE/SE) method, it has become possible to attain high accuracy in multidimensional flows, even in the presence of curved shocks. Examples presented here provide some new evidence of the errors committed in the use of operator split techniques, even those employing �unsplit� corrections. In these problems, the CE/SE method is able to maintain the original cylindrical symmetry of the problem and track the main features of the flow, while the operator split methods fail to maintain symmetry and position the shocks incorrectly, particularly near the focal point of the incom...|$|R

Kosal {{from the}} Sam Nunn School of International Affairs at the Georgia Institute of Technology, {{presented}} a lecture at the Nano@Tech Meeting on October 27, 2009 at 12 noon in room 1116 of the Marcus Nanotechnology building. The {{pursuit of the}} minutely small “nanotechnology” is thriving in academia, in the private sector, and in global state science and technology programs. Through the science fiction of Star Trek and other quasi-fictional works, the notion of nanotechnology has entered the collective public psyche. To date, three broad topics have dominated discussion regarding nanotechnology risk: health and environmental consequences, privacy and legal implications, and uncontrolled self-replication and artificial intelligence. Security implications, both for traditional nonproliferation regimes and for potential misuse by non-state actors, have not received commensurate attention. At the same time, policy makers and the scientific community, domestically and internationally, are attempting to develop new means to address risks associated with biotechnology. As 21 st century science and technology intrinsically traverses traditional borders “academic, public-private, and international” previous models are inadequate. Through examination of civilian and defensive applications (nanotechnologically-enabled countermeasures) and hypothetical offensive uses, {{the goal is to}} develop an <b>analytic</b> model to <b>probe</b> security questions surrounding this emerging technology. Recognizing and developing a robust analytical framework to assess implications of this emerging technology is an unexplored, cutting-edge research area for international security.

40|$|The self-consistent {{harmonic}} approximation is {{an effective}} harmonic theory to calculate the free energy of systems with strongly anharmonic atomic vibrations, and its stochastic implementation {{has proved to be}} an efficient method to study, from first-principles, the anharmonic properties of solids. The free energy as a function of average atomic positions (centroids) can be used to study quantum or thermal lattice instability. In particular the centroids are order parameters in second-order structural phase transitions such as, e. g., charge-density-waves or ferroelectric instabilities. According to Landau's theory, the knowledge of the second derivative of the free energy (i. e. the curvature) with respect to the centroids in a high-symmetry configuration allows the identification of the phase-transition and of the instability modes. In this work we derive the exact analytic formula for the second derivative of the free energy in the self-consistent harmonic approximation for a generic <b>atomic</b> configuration. The <b>analytic</b> derivative is expressed in terms of the atomic displacements and forces in a form that can be evaluated by a stochastic technique using importance sampling. Our approach is particularly suitable for applications based on first-principles density-functional-theory calculations, where the forces on atoms can be obtained with a negligible computational effort compared to total energy determination. Finally we propose a dynamical extension of the theory to calculate spectral properties of strongly anharmonic phonons, as probed by inelastic scattering processes. We illustrate our method with a numerical application on a toy model that mimics the ferroelectric transition in rock-salt crystals such as SnTe or GeTe...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the NMR chemical shift tensor has been implemented at the semiempirical MNDO level (modified neglect of diatomic overlap) for an spd basis using gauge-including <b>atomic</b> orbitals and <b>analytic</b> derivative theory. All relevant contributions to the chemical shifts of nuclei and points in space (nuclear independent chemical shifts, NICS), including three-center terms, can be computed. The execution time {{is dominated by the}} {{evaluation of}} the three-center terms, which typically require more than 90 % of the total effort. Calculations with standard MNDO parameters overestimate the variation of the paramagnetic contributions, leading to an unsatisfactory description of the trends in chemical shifts. Agreement with experiment is improved by reoptimizing the electronic structure parameters to reproduce the experimental chemical shifts for 97 small molecules and ions. One-center energies, orbital exponents, and resonance β parameters of H, C, N, and O have been adjusted, for a total of 16 parameters. The reference set covers chemical shift ranges of 31, 346, 933, and 1650 parts per million (ppm) for H, C, N, and O, respectively. The final RMS deviations from experiment are 0. 64, 13. 6, 39. 6, and 80. 6 ppm for H, C, N, and O, respectively, down from 1. 93, 36. 8, 120. 0, and 119. 0 ppm for the original MNDO parameters. This corresponds to less than 5 % of the total chemical shift range for each element. A significant fraction of the total error is due to small molecules with unusual bonding. On a larger set of solution NMR data for 384 common organic molecules, the RMS errors are reduced to 11. 9, 38. 8, and 61. 7 ppm for C, N, and O, respectively. Three-center terms typically contribute a few ppm to the total chemical shift for all four elements studied, but they are essential for a qualitatively correct description of 1 H chemical shifts and NICS. These terms are less important for C, N, and O, and can usually be omitted for these elements without significantly degrading the results. The overall quality of the results obtained with the NMR-specific parameterization is competitive with ab initio Hartree–Fock calculations. The relatively low computational cost permits studies of NMR chemical shifts and their trends in large molecules. Possible directions for future semiempirical NMR developments are outlined based on an analysis of some shortcomings of the present approach...|$|R
40|$|Much of the {{interstellar}} medium in disk galaxies {{is in the form}} of neutral atomic hydrogen, H I. This gas can be in thermal equilibrium at relatively low temperatures, T less than or similar to 300 K (the cold neutral medium [CNM]), or at temperatures somewhat less than 104 K (the warm neutral medium [WNM]). These two phases can coexist over a narrow range of pressures, P(min) less than or equal to P less than or equal to P(max). We determine P(min) and P(max) in the plane of the Galaxy as a function of Galactocentric radius R using recent determinations of the gas heating rate and the gas-phase abundances of interstellar gas. We provide an analytic approximation for P(min) as a function of metallicity, far-ultraviolet radiation field, and the ionization rate of <b>atomic</b> hydrogen. Our <b>analytic</b> results show that the existence of P(min), or the possibility of a two-phase equilibrium, generally requires that H(+) exceed C(+) in abundance at P(min). The abundance of H(+) is set by EUV/soft X-ray photoionization and by recombination with negatively charged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In order to assess whether thermal or pressure equilibrium is a realistic assumption, we de. ne a parameter Y = t(cool) /t(shock), where t(cool) is the gas cooling time and t(shock) is the characteristic shock time or "time between shocks in a turbulent medium. '' For Y < 1 gas has time to reach thermal balance between supernova-induced shocks. We find that this condition is satisfied in the Galactic disk, and thus the two-phase description of {{the interstellar}} H I is approximately valid even in the presence of interstellar turbulence. Observationally, the mean density [n(HI) ] is often better determined than the local density, and we cast our results in terms of [nHI] as well. Over most of the disk of the Galaxy, the H I must be in two phases: the weight of the H I in the gravitational potential of the Galaxy is large enough to generate thermal pressures exceeding Pmin, so that turbulent pressure fluctuations can produce cold gas that is thermally stable; and the mean density of the H I is too low for the gas to be all CNM. Our models predict the presence of CNM gas to R similar or equal to 16 - 18 kpc, somewhat farther than previous estimates. An estimate for the typical thermal pressure in the Galactic plane for 3 kpc less than or similar to R less than or similar to 18 kpc is P(th) /k similar or equal to 1. 4 x 10 (4) expd(-R/ 5. 5 kpc) K cm(- 3). At the solar circle, this gives P(th) /k similar or equal to 3000 K cm(- 3). We show that this pressure is consistent with the C I*/C I(tot) ratio observed by Jenkins & Tripp and the CNM temperature found by Heiles & Troland. We also examine the potential impact of turbulent heating on our results and provide parameterized expressions for the heating rate as a function of Galactic radius. Although the uncertainties are large, our models predict that including turbulent heating does not significantly change our results and that thermal pressures remain above P(min) to R similar or equal to 18 kpc...|$|R
