5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Amanita exitialis contain a unique purine {{nucleoside}} that is {{coupled with an}} amino acid derivative named N2-(1-methoxycarbonylethyl)guanosine. The discovery and identification of this chemical was the first report of a naturally occurring nucleoside in which an amino acid derivative is bonded through its α-amino nitrogen (the nitrogen bonded to the α-carbon) to a nucleobase <b>aglycone</b> by a C-N (carbon to nitrogen) bond. The new compound {{was determined to be}} toxic in the brine shrimp lethality test, but it did not have cytotoxic activity against a variety of human cancer cell lines. Other compounds isolated from the fungus include β-carboline and russulaceramide (a ceramide formerly found in some Russula mushrooms).|$|E
5|$|In {{the regions}} (e.g. various regions within North America) where low {{selenium}} soil levels lead to low {{concentrations in the}} plants, some animal species may be deficient unless selenium is supplemented with diet or injection. Ruminants are particularly susceptible. In general, absorption of dietary selenium is lower in ruminants than other animals, and is lower from forages than from grain. Ruminants grazing certain forages, e.g., some white clover varieties containing cyanogenic glycosides, may have higher selenium requirements, presumably because cyanide is released from the <b>aglycone</b> by glucosidase activity in the rumen and glutathione peroxidases is deactivated by the cyanide acting on the glutathione moiety. Neonate ruminants at risk of white muscle disease may be administered both selenium and vitamin E by injection; some of the WMD myopathies respond only to selenium, some only to vitamin E, and some to either.|$|E
25|$|The {{polyphenol}} {{composition of}} olive fruits varies during fruit ripening and during processing by fermentation when olives are immersed whole in brine or crushed to produce oil. In raw fruit, total polyphenol contents, {{as measured by}} the Folin method, are 117mg/100 g in black olives and 161mg/100 g in green olives, compared to 55 and 21mg/100 g for extra virgin and virgin olive oil, respectively. Olive fruit contains several types of polyphenols, mainly tyrosols, phenolic acids, flavonols and flavones, and for black olives, anthocyanins. The main bitter flavor of olives before curing results from oleuropein and its <b>aglycone</b> which total in content, respectively, 72 and 82mg/100 g in black olives, and 56 and 59mg/100 g in green olives.|$|E

25|$|In 1939, Russell Marker, a {{professor}} of organic chemistry at Pennsylvania State University, developed a method of synthesizing progesterone from plant steroid sapogenins, initially using sarsapogenin from sarsaparilla, which proved too expensive. After three years of extensive botanical research, he discovered a much better starting material, the saponin from inedible Mexican yams (Dioscorea mexicana and Dioscorea composita) found in the rain forests of Veracruz near Orizaba. The saponin could be converted in the lab to its <b>aglycone</b> moiety diosgenin. Unable to interest his research sponsor Parke-Davis in the commercial potential of synthesizing progesterone from Mexican yams, Marker left Penn State and in 1944 co-founded Syntex with two partners in Mexico City. When he left Syntex a year later the trade of the barbasco yam had started and {{the period of the}} heyday of the Mexican steroid industry had been started. Syntex broke the monopoly of European pharmaceutical companies on steroid hormones, reducing the price of progesterone almost 200-fold over the next eight years.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the chemical composition and antioxidant activity of free volatile <b>aglycones</b> from laurel (Laurus nobilis L.) {{as compared to}} its essential oil. Comparison of the chemical composition of volatile <b>aglycones</b> with the chemical composition of essential oil showed there was no similarity between the free compounds found in the essential oil and the corresponding volatile <b>aglycones.</b> Only eugenol {{was found to be}} identical. To evaluate the said antioxidant activities, two different methods were applied: 2, 2 ’-diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging method (DPPH) and ferric reducing/antioxidant power assay (FRAP).

40|$|Selective {{separation}} of flavonoid glycosides in Dalbergia odorifera by matrix solid-phase dispersion using titaniaDalbergia odorifera contains {{high concentrations of}} flavonoid <b>aglycones</b> and trace flavonoid glycosides. In this study, trace flavonoid glycosides were separated from D. odorifera by titania with matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD). Before the MSPD experiment, four standards, including two isoflavone glycosides (genistin and formononetin- 8 -C-apiosyl (1 - 6) -glucoside) and their <b>aglycones</b> (genistein and formononetin), were used to compare their retention on a titania column. The effect of acetonitrile concentration and pH on their retention was investigated and a conclusion was drawn that high acetonitrile concentration and pH lead to the greatest difference in the retention of flavonoid as glycosides and <b>aglycones.</b> Besides hydrophilic interaction and ligand-exchange interaction may exist between sugar moiety of flavonoid glycoside and titania, so that flavonoid glycosides have stronger retention than that of <b>aglycones.</b> Based on the chromatographic rule of flavonoid as glycosides and <b>aglycones</b> on the titania column, the MSPD method was optimized to elute high concentration flavonoid <b>aglycones</b> first with 90 % acetonitrile and 10 % water containing 100 mM ammonium acetate buffer, and then to elute trace flavonoid glycosides with 20 % acetonitrile and 80 % water containing 1 % trifluoroacetate (TFA).

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{different}} classes of dietary polyphenols on intestinal glucose uptake was investigated using polarised Caco- 2 intestinal cells.

Under sodium-free conditions, <b>aglycones</b> and non-glycosylated polyphenols inhibited glucose uptake whereas glycosides and phenolic acids were ineffective. These {{data suggest that}} <b>aglycones</b> inhibit facilitated glucose uptake whereas glycosides inhibit the active transport of glucose.

40|$|Extracts of ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) leaf {{are widely}} {{available}} worldwide in herbal medicinal products, dietary supplements, botanicals and complementary medicines, and several pharmacopoeias contain monographs for ginkgo leaf, leaf extract and finished products. Being a high-value botanical commodity, ginkgo extracts may {{be the subject of}} economically motivated adulteration. We analysed eight ginkgo leaf retail products purchased in Australia and Denmark and found compelling evidence of adulteration with flavonol <b>aglycones</b> in three of these. The same three products also contained genistein, an isoflavone that does not occur in ginkgo leaf. Although the United States Pharmacopeia – National Formulary (USP-NF) and the British and European Pharmacopoeias stipulate a required range for flavonol glycosides in ginkgo extract, the prescribed assays quantify flavonol <b>aglycones.</b> This means that these pharmacopoeial methods are not capable of detecting adulteration of ginkgo extract with free flavonol <b>aglycones.</b> We propose a simple modification of the USP-NF method that addresses this problem: by assaying for flavonol <b>aglycones</b> pre and post hydrolysis the content of flavonol glycosides can be accurately estimated via a simple calculation.

40|$|The {{cytotoxicity}} {{of natural}} glycosides from Ginseng, semisynthetic analogues and related triterpenes of the dammarane series, {{isolated from the}} leaves of the Far-East species of the genus Betula was studied in order to elucidate structure-activity relationships.
