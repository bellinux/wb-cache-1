5000|$|The greater <b>palatine</b> nerve (<b>anterior</b> <b>palatine</b> nerve) is {{a branch}} of the pterygopalatine {{ganglion}} that carries both general sensory fibres from the maxillary nerve and parasympathetic fibers from the nerve of the pterygoid canal. It descends through the greater <b>palatine</b> <b>canal,</b> emerges upon the hard palate through the greater palatine foramen, and passes forward in a groove in the hard palate, nearly as far as the incisor teeth.|$|R
50|$|The lesser <b>palatine</b> <b>canals</b> (also {{accessory}} <b>palatine</b> <b>canals)</b> are {{passages in}} the palatine bone that carry the lesser and middle palatine nerves and vessels.|$|R
5000|$|The greater <b>palatine</b> <b>canal</b> {{starts on}} the {{inferior}} {{aspect of the}} pterygopalatine fossa. It goes through the maxilla and palatine bones to reach the palate, ending at the greater palatine foramen. From this canal, accessory canals branch off; these are known as the lesser <b>palatine</b> <b>canals.</b>|$|R
50|$|The lesser <b>palatine</b> <b>canals</b> {{start from}} the greater <b>palatine</b> <b>canal,</b> and run with them, also opening into {{the roof of the}} oral cavity. Their {{openings}} are known as the lesser palatine foramina, and they transmit the lesser palatine artery, vein, and nerve, as wll as the middle palatine vessels and nerve.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In the literature, {{there has}} been {{controversy}} regarding {{the length of the}} greater <b>palatine</b> <b>canal.</b> If the pterygopalatine fossa is infiltrated in an attempt to reduce bleeding during sinus surgery, this information is important to be able to place local anesthetic with maximal effect and the least likelihood of complications. STUDY DESIGN: The authors conducted a prospective cadaver-based study using high-definition computed tomography (CT) scans. METHODS: Twenty-two cadaver heads were CT scanned and the greater <b>palatine</b> <b>canal</b> length, pterygopalatine fossa height, and thickness of the soft tissue in the roof of the mouth were measured on parasagittal images using the CT scanner workstation. RESULTS: The mean length of the greater <b>palatine</b> <b>canal</b> was 18. 5 mm (95 % confidence interval [CI]= 17. 9 - 19. 1) and the mean height of the pterygopalatine fossa was 21. 6 mm (95 % CI= 20. 7 - 22. 5). The mean thickness of the soft tissue in the roof of the mouth overlying the foramen of the greater <b>palatine</b> <b>canal</b> was 6. 9 mm (95 % CI= 6. 2 - 7. 6). CONCLUSION: To perform an effective infiltration of the pterygopalatine fossa, the needle should be bent at 25 mm from the tip at an angle of 45 degrees.

Significant intertrait associations were found between some pairs of the traits, but not consistently across the large geographical samples.

Better {{understanding of the}} anatomy in this region may minimize possible vascular complications. The aim {{of the study was}} to study the osteology of the posterior maxillary region and establish clinical safety guidelines for the Le Fort I osteotomy. Thirty human dry skulls were selected and assessed by a combination of direct inspection, computerized imaging and computed tomography (CT) scan analysis. Results showed that the presence of maxillary third molars influenced the transverse angulation of the posterior vertical cut. Synostosis of the pterygomaxillary junction was noted in 12 % of samples.

50|$|In {{the human}} mouth, the incisive foramen, also called <b>anterior</b> <b>palatine</b> foramen, or nasopalatine foramen is a funnel-shaped {{opening in the}} bone of the oral hard palate {{immediately}} behind the incisor teeth where blood vessels and nerves pass. The incisive foramen is continuous with the incisive canal, this foramen or group of foramina is located behind the central incisor teeth in the incisive fossa of the maxilla.|$|R
5000|$|The Inferior {{posterior}} nasal {{branches of}} greater palatine nerve are small nerves which largely supply the posterior {{aspect of the}} nasal cavity. They pass through small foramina in the <b>palatine</b> <b>canal</b> to supply the lateral walls of the nasal cavity - including the superior, middle, and inferior nasal concha. These nerves run alongside the lateral posterior nasal arteries, which are branches of the sphenopalatine artery.|$|R
50|$|The {{descending}} palatine artery branches off of the maxillary artery in the pterygopalatine fossa and descends {{through the}} greater <b>palatine</b> <b>canal</b> along with the greater palatine nerve (from the pterygopalatine ganglion).

40|$|Background: Greater <b>palatine</b> <b>canal</b> is {{used for}} maxillary nerve block. This {{procedure}} has some complications such as proptosis, blindness, and intravascular injection. This study aimed to determine the mean greater <b>palatine</b> <b>canal</b> length (CL) and its typical anatomic routes, {{as well as provide}} a reliable facial index for computing the CL by using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) data. Materials and Methods: A total of 138 CBCT scans (65 females and 73 males) were evaluated. The path of the canal and the CL were determined by sex, age, and side. The mean distance from the inferior border of the infraorbital foramen (IOF) to the crest of alveolar bone between maxillary premolar(CMP) was measured and compared with the CL. Paired t-tests, independent t-test, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for statistical analysis. Results: The mean of CL was 31. 82 ± 1. 37 mm (31. 70 ± 2. 44 mm on the right side and 31. 94 ± 2. 40 mm on the left side), and the values were 32. 49 ± 2. 37 mm in males and 30. 55 ± 1. 76 mm among females (P = 0. 001). The mean distance from the IOF to the CMP was 32. 01 ± 2. 18 mm, which was not significantly different to the CL (P = 0. 336). Conclusions: The mean CL was significantly different according to sex and side. The mean distance from the IOF to CMP was significantly different according to sex. On comparing the mean distance from the IOF to the CMP with the CL, no significant difference was observed. Therefore, the mean distance from the IOF to CMP may be a reliable clinical index...|$|R
50|$|Chanaresuchus has a low, {{elongate}} skull that {{is characteristic}} of proterochampsians.

The skull table is highly ornamented in larger specimens, with the dermal bones well sculptured. The palate of Chanaresuchus has two elongate choanae.

40|$|Introduction: Non-Hodgkin lymphomas {{are common}} cancers that can {{develop in the}} upper aero-digestive tract. We {{describe}} {{a case of a}} large B-cell palatine lymphoma with spontaneous clinical regression. Case: A 58 -year-old female patient presented with a sub-mucosal lesion of the hard palate. CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lesion invading the right posterior <b>palatine</b> <b>canal.</b> At the second consultation, 15 days after performing the biopsy, the lesion had disappeared.

Only 27 cases have been described in the international literature. The anatomopathological analysis is often difficult to perform. The final diagnosis is often made by immunochemistry.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{accidents}} might happen during {{the treatment of the}} root canal system, where the instrument separation {{is one of the most}} unpleasant occurrences.

The case has its outline based on a 31 -year-old patient who sought the clinic to have her maxillary first left premolar rehabilitated. The clinic and radiographic examinations revealed the need of endodontic retreatment and the presence of a fragment of a K-file instrument localized at the apical third of the <b>palatine</b> <b>canal.</b> The retreatment was initiated by the removal of the obturation materials followed by several unsuccessful attempts to take out the fractured instrument. Hence, it was chosen to perform the fragment removal using a hypodermic needle and cyanoacrylate adhesive.
