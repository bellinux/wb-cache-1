5|$|Determined {{and with}} renewed hope, Twilight leads her best friends back to Ponyville, which Discord has altered in a chaotic manner: The day-night cycle is {{haphazard}} and buildings float off the ground. Discord continues to taunt Twilight, {{but she is}} determined {{to get back to}} the library in town to find a way to defeat Discord while her best friends' personalities continue to become more warped, losing even more of their color until they are completely monochrome. Managing to get them all into the library, Twilight and Spike locate the book about the Elements of Harmony and after a brief scuffle with the other ponies over the book, are surprised and delighted to find the book actually contains the Elements. She forces her best friends to wear the Elements, though they <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> help after she angrily states that the sooner they defeat Discord, the sooner they never have to see each other again; Twilight also assigns Spike as the temporary Element of Loyalty because Rainbow Dash is not present. They go to face Discord, but the Elements fail to activate. The other four ponies and Spike quickly drop the elements and depart, leaving Twilight despondent and finally losing her own color.|$|E
5|$|That praises {{are without}} reason lavished on the dead, {{and that the}} honours due only to {{excellence}} are paid to antiquity, is a complaint likely to be always continued by those, who, being able to add nothing to truth, hope for eminence from the heresies of paradox; or those, who, being forced by disappointment upon consolatory expedients, are willing to hope from posterity what the present age refuses, and flatter themselves that the regard which is yet denied by envy, will be at last bestowed by time. Antiquity, like every other quality that attracts the notice of mankind, has undoubtedly votaries that reverence it, not from reason, but from prejudice. Some seem to admire indiscriminately whatever has been long preserved, without considering that time has sometimes co-operated with chance; all perhaps <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> honour past than present excellence; and the mind contemplates genius through the shades of age, as the eye surveys the sun through artificial opacity. The great contention of criticism {{is to find the}} faults of the moderns, and the beauties of the ancients. While an authour is yet living we estimate his powers by his worst performance, and when he is dead we rate them by his best.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} if patients allow medical students to perform less invasive procedures compared to more invasive procedures, {{and how this}} is related to patient demographics and previous experience with medical students. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in six areas of Birmingham, UK. All members {{of the general public}} over the age of 18 were eligible, excluding non-English speaking people and those with cognitive impairments. Respondents were asked to rank their willingness for medical students to perform history taking/examinations and clinical procedures of varying degrees of invasiveness. Results: We received a total of 293 responses. For both history taking/examinations and clinical procedures, people <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> allow medical students to perform less invasive procedures rather than more invasive procedures. White and older people <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> allow all history taking/examinations procedures; additionally, women <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> allow history taking. White, female, and older participants <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> allow blood pressure measurement; whilst older people and those with previous experience <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> allow venepuncture. No significant associations were found for intubation. Conclusions: The public is less willing for medical students to perform more invasive procedures. This may severely limit opportunities to attain clinical competencies...|$|R

25|$|Cultural/traditional {{practices}} do not favour girl’s education. Girls only represent 20% {{of pupils}} in {{primary and secondary}} schools (forced and early marriage plays important role). Some parents refused daughters school because they could learn about family planning and contraception and other ways of critical thinking. However girls <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> partake in learning because education is a means to free themselves from family oppression. There is a rule requiring boys and girls to eat together at school. This has encouraged the coeducational idea, {{in sharp contrast to}} traditional practice, particularly for the Sudanese.|$|E
25|$|The ICRC {{prefers to}} engage states {{directly}} and relies on low-key and confidential negotiations {{to lobby for}} access to prisoners of war and improvement in their treatment. Its findings are not available {{to the general public}} but are shared only with the relevant government. This is in contrast to related organizations like Doctors Without Borders and Amnesty International who <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> expose abuses and apply public pressure to governments. The ICRC reasons that this approach allows it greater access and cooperation from governments in the long run.|$|E
25|$|Handspinners are split, when {{spinning}} wool, as {{to whether}} it is better to spin it 'in the grease' (with lanolin still in) or after it has been washed. More traditional spinners <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> spin in the grease, as it is less work to wash the wool after it is in yarn form. Spinners who spin very fine yarn may also prefer to spin in the grease as it can allow them to spin finer yarns with more ease. Spinning in the grease covers the spinner's hands in lanolin and, thus, softens the spinner's hands.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2009, with {{unemployment}} at 9.5% and climbing, Warsh {{argued that}} the Fed should begin to pull back on its efforts to help the real economy recover: [...] "if policymakers insist on waiting until the level of real activity has plainly and substantially returned to normal — and the economy has returned to self-sustaining trend growth — they will almost certainly have waited too long… There is a risk, of much debated magnitude, that the unusually high level of reserves, along with substantial liquid assets of the banking system, could fuel an unanticipated, excessive surge in lending."

40|$|Objective To {{examine the}} {{influences}} of disease, lifestyle, and other factors on adolescent medical providers’ willingness to recommend genetic susceptibility testing (GST).  Method Providers attending a national conference completed a self-report survey (n = 232) about their willingness to recommend hypothetical GSTs, differentiated by disease (nicotine addiction/lung cancer), patient lifestyle (nonsmoker/smoker), and other contextual factors.  Results Compared to recommending GST unconditionally, providers <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> recommend GST with parental/patient consent/assent, and {{in the presence of}} a preexisting illness and substance abuse history. Compared to offering nicotine addiction GST to a nonsmoker, providers <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> offer this type of testing to a smoker and <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> offer GST for lung cancer regardless of patient lifestyle.  Conclusions Providers’ willingness to recommend GSTs is sensitive to many factors. Efforts to integrate GST into adolescent preventive care likely <b>will</b> need <b>to</b> address these and other influences on provider behavior...|$|R
40|$|Females {{have largely}} been {{neglected}} in the risk taking literature. Risk taking {{is thought to be}} a male trait, adapted to compete against other males (intrasexual competition) for access to mates. The following thesis proposes that women also have an incentive to compete intrasexually to attain a mate, and thus an incentive to take risks. However the types of risk women take will differ from that of men. Specifically, intrasexual competition <b>will</b> drive women <b>to</b> take sexual and appearance risks, and drive men to take financial, physical and sexual risks. Three hundred and seventy-two participants completed an online questionnaire which measured their individual levels of intrasexual competition using Buunk & Fisher’s (2009) Intrasexual Competition Scale, and measured their willingness to engage in a range of financial, physical, sexual and appearance risks. It was found that overall males <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take physical and sexual risks, and women <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take <b>more</b> financial and appearance risks. Furthermore it was found that people with higher levels of intrasexual competition <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take physical, sexual and appearance risks than those with lower levels of intrasexual competition. However there was no association found between levels of intrasexual competition willingness to take financial risks. The following findings were made within each gender: Within men, those with higher levels of intrasexual competition <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take physical and sexual risks than those with lower levels of intrasexual competition. Within women, those with higher levels of intrasexual competition <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> take physical, sexual, and appearance risks than those with lower levels of intrasexual competition. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed...|$|R
