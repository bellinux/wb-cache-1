In this paper we also study the problem of Hopf bifurcation for non-smooth planar systems, obtaining new results. More precisely, we prove that one or two limit cycles can be produced from an elementary focus of the least order (order 1 for foci of FF or FP type and order 2 for foci of PP type) (Theorem 2. 3), different from the case of smooth systems. For piecewise linear systems we prove that 2 limit cycles can appear near a focus of either FF, FP or PP type (Theorem 3. 3) ...|$|E
40|$|Graphs are {{naturally}} sparse {{objects that are}} used to study many problems involving networks, for example, distributed learning and graph signal processing. In some cases, the graph is not given, but must be learned from the problem and available data. Often it is desirable to learn sparse graphs. However, making a graph highly sparse can split the graph into several disconnected components, leading to several separate networks. The main difficulty is that connectedness is often treated as a combinatorial property, making it hard to enforce in e. g. convex optimization problems. In this article, we show how connectedness of undirected graphs can be formulated as an <b>analytical</b> <b>property</b> and can be enforced as a convex constraint. We especially show how the constraint relates to the distributed consensus problem and graph Laplacian learning. Using simulated and real data, we perform experiments to learn sparse and connected graphs from data. Comment: 5 pages, presented at the European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO) 201...|$|E

40|$|The {{continuous}} orthogonal polynomials, such as Zernike and pseudo-Zernike, {{are often}} used as an expansion of corneal height data. However, the use of continuous polynomials has some limitations due to the discretization. It is because that the integrals are usually approximated by discrete summations, and this process not only leads to numerical errors, but also severely affects some analytical properties such as rotation invariance, orthogonality, etc. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper presents a methodology for decomposing corneal height data into discrete orthogonal Tchebichef polynomials. Tchebichef polynomials, which are a product of angular functions and radial Tchebichef polynomials, are orthogonal in the discrete coordinate. Therefore, the approximation error caused by discretization can be avoided, and the <b>analytical</b> <b>property</b> can be well preserved. Examples of modeling corneal elevation are provided for simulation corneas, real normal corneas, and real abnormal corneas. The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed discrete Tchebichef polynomials have better surface representation capability than Zernike polynomials or pseudo-Zernike polynomials, and have more robust fitting for the level of noise found in current videokeratoscopes, {{so that they can be}} used as an alternative to fit the corneal surface...|$|E
40|$|Vibration {{diagnosis}} {{is one of}} the most common techniques in condition evaluation of wind turbine equipped with gearbox. On the other side, gearbox {{is one of the}} key components of wind turbine drivetrain. Due to the stochastic operation of wind turbines, the gearbox shaft rotating speed changes with high percentage, which limits the application of traditional vibration signal processing techniques, such as fast Fourier transform. This paper investigates a new approach for wind turbine high speed shaft gear fault diagnosis using discrete wavelet transform and time synchronous averaging. First, the vibration signals are decomposed into a series of subbands signals with the use of a multiresolution <b>analytical</b> <b>property</b> of the discrete wavelet transform. Then, 22 condition indicators are extracted from the TSA signal, residual signal, and difference signal. Through the case study analysis, a new approach reveals the most relevant condition indicators based on vibrations that can be used for high speed shaft gear spalling fault diagnosis and their tracking abilities for fault degradation progression. It is also shown that the proposed approach enhances the gearbox fault diagnosis ability in wind turbines.

40|$|Transcendental {{stiffness}} matrices for vibration (or buckling) {{have been}} derived from exact analytical solutions {{of the governing}} differential equations for many structural members without recourse to the discretization of conventional finite element methods (FEM). Their assembly into the overall dynamic structural stiffness matrix gives a transcendental eigenproblem, whose eigenvalues (natural frequencies or critical load factors) can be found with certainty using the Wittrick–Williams algorithm. A very recently discovered <b>analytical</b> <b>property</b> is the member stiffness determinant, which equals the FEM stiffness matrix determinant of a clamped ended member modelled by infinitely many elements, normalized by dividing by its value at zero frequency (or load factor). Curve following convergence methods for transcendental eigenproblems are greatly simplified by multiplying the transcendental overall stiffness matrix determinant by all the member stiffness determinants to remove its poles. In this paper, the transcendental stiffness matrix for a vibrating, axially loaded, Timoshenko member is expressed in a new, convenient notation, enabling the first ever derivation of its member stiffness determinant to be obtained. Further expressions are derived, also for the first time, for unloaded and for static, loaded Timoshenko members. These new expressions have the advantage that they readily reduce to corresponding expressions for Bernoulli–Euler members when shear rigidity and rotatory inertia are neglected. Additionally, the total equivalence of the normalized transcendental determinant with that of an infinite order FEM formulation aids understanding and evaluation of conventional FEM results. Examples are presented to illustrate {{the use of the}} member stiffness determinant...|$|E
