40|$|Crystalline silicon (Si) wafers used as {{substrates}} in {{the semiconductor}} and photovoltaic (PV) industries are traditionally manufactured using a multi-wire slurry sawing (MWSS) technique. Due to its high productivity potential, the fixed <b>abrasive</b> <b>diamond</b> wire sawing (DWS) technique is of considerable interest to Si wafer producers. Although both sawing techniques are currently {{used in the}} industry, a fundamental understanding of the underlying process is still lacking, particularly for diamond wire sawing. Consequently, optimization of the wire sawing process is carried out largely based on experience and trial and error. This thesis aims to develop a systematic fundamental understanding of diamond wire sawing of Si materials used for PV applications. First of all, a comparative analysis {{of the characteristics of}} silicon wafers cut by slurry and fixed <b>abrasive</b> <b>diamond</b> wire sawing is presented. The analysis results indicate that fixed <b>abrasive</b> <b>diamond</b> wire sawing may be a viable alternative to slurry wire sawing. Modeling and experimental studies of single grit diamond scribing of Si are proposed to shed light on the basic cutting mechanisms. Although Si is brittle at room temperature, it is possible to properly control the cutting conditions to obtain a completely ductile mode of material removal. The effects of material anisotropy, abrasive grit shape, friction condition and external hydrostatic pressure on the ductile-to-brittle mode transition in cutting of single crystal Si (sc-Si) are systematically investigated. Multicrystalline Si (mc-Si) based solar cells take up the majority of the global PV market. Hard inclusions (Silicon carbide and Silicon nitride) in multicrystalline Si (mc-Si) ingots may cause wire breakage and negatively impact the process, surface/subsurface morphology and mechanical properties of the resulting wafer. Their effects are experimentally studied through the single grit diamond scribing on the mc-Si sample with high density of inclusions. Finally, it is identified that there is a correlation between the high dislocation density and the increase of fracture toughness in mc-Si. The increase in fracture toughness leads to greater capability of ductile mode of cutting and higher specific scribing energy in the brittle fracture regime. Results of these fundamental investigations are expected to generate useful knowledge for optimizing the diamond wire sawing process in order to achieve high productivity and minimum surface/subsurface damage.

Two sets of specimens of different surface roughness are generated by varying the cutting conditions for each material. One set is rectified. First, the results of compression and inter laminar shear tests show that the mechanical behavior is highly affected by the surface roughness.

40|$|Modifications in {{the process}} {{industry}} are quite common. For many of these modifications cutting of existing equipment and structure will be a central activity. The <b>abrasive</b> <b>diamond</b> wire cutting technology is adopted from the stone cutting industry, and has proven to cut cross-sections of steel quite efficient. However, as for any machining process, there will be heat generated from friction and a spark emission. Since most of the process plants are regarded as a hazardous zone, in terms of potentially explosive atmospheres, {{there will always be}} a risk increase when performing work which produces potential ignition sources. The ATEX Directive was founded for allowing free trade of explosion proof equipment within the European Union. Thus the requirements found within the ATEX Directive are established to reduce the risk of ignition for the relevant equipment which fulfills the requirements stated therein. In this thesis the theory of diamond wire is established by adopting central elements from conventional abrasive technology. This theory is then used as a basis for a thermal model, usable for numerical simulations. The model is partially validated against measured temperatures. However, when adding coolants the model would over-estimate the temperatures. The results obtained showed that diamond wire cutting most likely would be safe, in terms of hot surfaces, if adequate cooling is applied. When regarding sparks no conclusions could be obtained of either ignition potential or temperature...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSurface {{roughness}} or texture is {{the most}} visible property of any object, including injection molded plastic parts. Roughness of the injection molding (IM) tool cavity directly affects not only appearance and perception of quality, but often also the function of all manufactured plastic parts. So called “optically smooth” plastic surfaces is one example, where low roughness of a tool cavity is desirable. Such tool surfaces can be very expensive to fabricate using conventional means, such as <b>abrasive</b> <b>diamond</b> polishing or diamond turning. We present a novel process to coat machined metal parts with hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) to reduce their surface roughness. Results from the testing of surfaces made from two starting roughnesses are presented; one polished with grit 2500 sandpaper, another with grit 11. 000 diamond polishing paste. We characterize the two surfaces with AFM, SEM and optical profilometry before and after coating. We show that the HSQ coating is able to reduce peak-to-valley roughness more than 20 times on the sandpaper polished sample, from 2. 44 (± 0. 99) μm to 104 (± 22) nm and more than 10 times for the paste polished sample from 1. 85 (± 0. 63) μm to 162 (± 28) nm while roughness averages are reduced 10 and 3 times respectively. We completed more than 10, 000 injection molding cycles without detectable degradation of the HSQ coating.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in thin film synthesis of diamond have facilitated {{a host of}} new technical applications. These are motivated by the many attractive properties of diamond, for example high hardness, chemical inertness, transparency and heat conductivity. Unfortunately, these properties also make it difficult to fashion complex geometries. Other problems are the severely limited choice of suitable substrate materials and large surface roughness. To reduce these complications, a technology denoted replication and bodybuilding has been developed. The basic principle is to grow the diamond film onto a mold and then build a mechanical support on top of the diamond film. Then the mold is removed. Thereby, a diamond surface with the desired 3 D geometry and the same surface roughness as the mold is created. Three potential applications for devices built using the replication and bodybuilding concept have been explored. Grinding tools for hard materials have proved superior to conventional technology in rate of removal as well as in resulting surface finish. Diamond surfaces have also been crafted into ultra-durable dies for injection molding of hard particle reinforced polymers. Initial testing of an <b>abrasive</b> <b>diamond</b> device, intended to make CMP processes more economical and easier to control has successfully been carried out. Diamond and diamond-like carbon is well-known for being “low-friction materials”, but are here demonstrated to actually be “high-friction materials” with the ability to disguise themselves in certain environments, most notably with the aid of water molecules. The mechanisms involved in these variations have been investigated. Using NEXAFS it is shown that high friction sliding is accompanied by changes in the material structure. These changes are induced by surface roughness as well as by strong adhesive forces. Highly hydrogenated carbon coatings, on the other hand, affording super-low friction coefficients (< 0. 01) under certain circumstances, will suffer an increase in friction in the presence of water...|$|E
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of a photovoltaic Si wafer comprises of first a high temperature heating process {{to produce a}} Si ingot from polycrystalline Silicon, which is then cut into bricks and subsequently sawn into wafers using a wire saw. These processes create residual stresses both from the thermal gradient induced by solidification and from either the rolling-indenting or scratching-indenting processes caused {{by the type of}} wire saw used. The objective of this research is to study silicon wafer residual stress {{as a result of the}} typical industry {{manufacturing process}}es and by doing so, better understand the mechanical properties that lead to increased fracture. This thesis aims to quantify the amount of residual stress generated by the solidification/thermal gradient produced during the casting of Si ingots separately from the residual stress generated by the wire sawing process. Samples from industry are used to compare the effects of the manufacturing processes on residual stress in multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers including the effects of fixed <b>abrasive</b> <b>diamond</b> wire sawing (DWS) vs. loose abrasive (LAWS) slurry wire sawing used in the wafering process. Near-infrared birefringence polariscopy and polarized micro-Raman spectroscopy are used to study wafer residual stresses within grains and at grain boundaries in mc-Si as a function of etch-depth. While near-infrared birefringence polariscopy allows for the measurement of full-field maximum shear stress, micro-Raman spectroscopy provides decomposition of the stress tensor into both principal and shear in-plane stress components. Consequently, regions of high tensile stress, which are detrimental to the mechanical integrity of the wafer, can be easily identified. In addition to the mechanical characterization, the residual stress produced by the thermal gradient/solidification process for multi-crystalline Si wafers was also correlated to electrical performance of mc-Si wafers using photoluminescence.

40|$|Introduction: The most {{commonly}} used materials for prosthetic denture base are acrylic resins - polymethyl methacrylate, which has all the important physical and chemical properties. The bond between a denture base and an acrylic tooth has a significant functional value. Aim: To evaluate the influence of various procedures on bonding quality between the denture base and the artificial tooth, the measurement of gaps when connecting the tooth and the denture base using an optical or electron microscope, and evaluating the mechanical properties by compressive testing. Materials and methods: Forty eight acrylic models with bonds between acrylic teeth and prosthetic denturebases, and 12 models for compressive testing were created as the materials in this in vitro study. The acrylic models were allocated to four groups (with 12 samples) for microscopy, and three groups for compressive testing. The samples for microscopy contained denture bases with fixed, unprocessed acrylic teeth, mechanically processed acrylic teeth, chemically processed acrylic teeth, and mechanically and chemically processed acrylic teeth, respectively. The acrylic models had the same dimensions, and the surface of each model was prepared using a slow speed saw, <b>abrasive</b> <b>diamond</b> paste, and special paper grinders. A special metal cast was created for compressive testing with internal dimensions of 20 x 9 mm. The size of a gap was measured on the light inverse microscope (Nikon Epiphot 300) and pressure testing was performed on a Zwick/Roell Z 010 pressure machine. Results: The average value of the gap on mechanically and chemically treated samples was 68. 250 μm, which was {{significantly lower than the}} gap on the untreated samples with the average value of 103. 75 μm. The compressive strength was 3200 N/mm 2 on untreated samples and above 6000 N/mm 2 on the mechanically and chemically treated ones. Conclusions: It can be concluded that surfaces which come into contact must be mechanically and chemically processed. Although in practice prostheses are made using mechanical tooth-base retention, larger gaps occur when compared to mechanically and chemically processed surfaces...|$|E

The grains fixed to a lapping plate were confirmed by SEM and AFM observations. Among many experimental parameters, the change of the pitch of fine grooves on a lapping plate formed by the facing operation has a significant effect on the removal rate. This agrees well with the calculated number of loose grains under various pitches of groove. The average removal rate with fixed and loose grains was found to be about 2. 7 times higher than that with only fixed grains. These results indicate that during lapping, the material is mainly removed by loose grains. It is evident from AFM images that the lapped surface with material removed by fixed grains differs very much from that with material removed simultaneously by fixed and loose grains...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{is based on}} the Maltese archipelago, a collection of islands with no other building material available apart from Globigerina limestone. Importing materials before the industrial revolution was an impractical endeavour which led for the inhabitants of the island to learn and master ways how stone {{can be used in a}} variety of ways. This restriction resulted in a cultural landscape made out of one material, hence the material has not only transcended from a building resource to a building system but also became a predominant factor in the cultural identity of the island. Furthermore, stone’s natural and massive qualities arises the sense of firmness and timelessness, qualities which are rarely found in contemporary architecture. Alas, this building tradition is being replaced by modern industrialised materials and building techniques which depend on standardisation and require much less craftsmanship. The knowledge of this art and technique of cutting volumetric stones and assembling it into a building (stereotomy) is becoming less and less of a viable option, hence in risk of becoming stagnant and redundant. This study explores regionalism from a technologic and material point of view. It investigates the combination of traditional building techniques with current emerging technologies in digital fabrication with the goal to understand, reinterpret and also extend the performance of stereotomy as building technique through the use of computer aided craftsmanship. For this reason the starting points of this research were the material characteristics and craftsmanship considerations; more specifically, compression-only structural system and 6 -axis industrial robotic arm with an <b>abrasive</b> <b>diamond</b> wire cutter. This ultimately strives for the preservation and contemporary reinterpretation of a cultural identity enrooted in the use of stone.

Both stone stereotomy and Maltese literature share the idea of transcendence from the mundane into the extraordinary; a narrative which was also the main driving force for the architectural gesture shown in the building’s morphology.

40|$|Abrasive flow {{machining}} (AFM) is {{a unique}} machining method used to achieve high surface quality on inner, difficult-to-access and on outside contours. Using AFM, {{it is possible to}} realise predefined edge rounding on any brittle or hard marerial. AFM is easy to integrate in an automated manufacturing environment. The abrasive medium applied during AFM is a fluid consisting of a polymer which carries silicon carbide or super-abrasive grains. With a specified pressure and temperature, this fluid flows in alternating directions along the contours of the workpiece resulting in an abrasive effect. AFM is also well suited to process advanced ceramic materials. Especially advanced ceramics increasingly are playing a significant role as a substitute for metals. However, the high costs for the inevitable finishing process on ceramics prevent a more frequent use. This paper represents the technological results of a research project discovering the fundamental principles of AFM on advanced ceramic materials such as a correlation between flow processes, surface formation and edge rounding. Furthermore, an insight into a process model is given which was developed using modern simulation techniques. The overall objective of this approach is to anticipate work results like surface quality and edge rounding on any user-defined geometry. The material removal process behaviour of ceramic materials is mainly ductile, hence the smooth surface is extending. As a result of the machining process, typical washed-out surface textures occur. Grain boundaries as well as edges of micro cracks have been smoothed out. By removing the surface layer by layer, existing damages beneath the surface have been uncovered with AFM. Only when a failure of the grain boundary is approached, grains are breaking off. The investigation shows that for advanced ceramics a ductile material removal mechanism is achieved by using <b>abrasive</b> <b>diamond</b> grains with average grain size under 44, 5 micron, whereas a brittle material removal mechanism could be achieved with grain size upon 185 micron. It has been proved that in most cases a weight ratio of 1 : 2 between carrier fluid to abrasive grain is attained to success. Rising temperature leads to descending viscosity of the grinding medium, hence the abrasive removal rate is sinking. By raising the processing pressure and reduction of the flow cross-section, the fluid velocity and the removal rate are increasing...|$|E

Higher annealing temperatures, however, led to a decline in wear resistance from its highest value. Similar behavior was seen for 1300 °C-annealed samples subjected to 15 �m <b>diamond</b> <b>abrasive,</b> although highertemperature annealing at 1500 °– 1600 °C enhanced the wear resistance again. When coarse abrasives (72 �m) were used, the wear resistance progressively increased with increased annealing temperature from � 1000 ° to 1600 °C. Corresponding transmission and scanning electron microscopy studies indicated that, whereas transgranular, conchoidal cracking was dominant in the mild abrasive wear with fine-scale (3 �m) abrasives, intergranular cracking and subsequent grain pullout was far more predominant in the more severe abrasive wear with coarse abrasives. Because the hardness and indentation toughness were barely altered during thermal treatment, the observed wear behavior was attributed mainly to the thermally induced microstructural changes, including the crystallization of glassy grain-boundary films, the possible strengthening of the boundaries due to the enhancement of the aluminum, and the formation of aluminum-rich, coherent nanoscale precipitates in the matrix grains above 1300 °C.
