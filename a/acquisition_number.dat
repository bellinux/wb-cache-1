50|$|However, {{given the}} low <b>acquisition</b> <b>numbers</b> of the {{original}} FN Kégresse 3T and the direct sale of Citroën Kégresse P14's to the Belgian armed forces the design clearly left something to be desired. So a second version was introduced with a slightly uprated 60 hp FN63T 8 cylinder gasoline engine, {{very similar to the}} one used in the FN63C lorry, by that time also in use with the Belgian army. Construction of the new model started in earnest by 1938.|$|R

40|$|Both ghost imaging (GI) and ghost imaging via {{compressive}} sampling (GICS) can nonlocally image an object. We {{report the}} influence of spatial transverse coherence property of a thermal source on GI and GICS and show that, using the same <b>acquisition</b> <b>numbers,</b> the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of images recovered by GI will be reduced while the quality of reconstructed images will be enhanced for GICS as the spatial transverse coherence lengths located on the object plane are decreased. Differences between GI and GICS, methods to further improve the quality and image extraction efficiency of GICS, and its potential applications are also discussed. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the time series properties of UK <b>acquisition</b> <b>numbers</b> {{in the period}} 1969 to 2003 using a three-regime Markov Switching Model. The majority of the data is characterised by a relatively stable series, and this regime has by far the longest duration. It is necessary, however, to also include regimes that represent both {{the beginning and end}} of the waves to accurately model the data. The expected duration of the regime that marks the end of a wave is longer than that characterising the start, revealing that the start of a merger wave is marked by more extreme changes in behaviour. This somewhat surprising result is then confirmed with further analysis of the characteristics of the regimes marking {{the beginning and end of}} the waves...|$|R
