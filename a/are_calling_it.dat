The modern prison system (along with local jails) is a {{collection}} of ghettos or poorhouses reserved primarily for the unskilled, the uneducated, and the powerless. In increasing numbers this system is being reserved for racial minorities, especially blacks, which is why we <b>are</b> <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> the New American Apartheid. This is the same segment of American society that has experienced some of the most drastic reductions in income and they have been targeted for their involvement in drugs and the subsequent violence that extends from the lack of legitimate means of goal attainment.|$|E

The day before the first shoot, I sat in my hotel and looked to the script thinking, 'Damn, wish I could re-write this whole thing.' After the film released, my dad called me up saying 'you know The New York Times <b>are</b> <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> the worst film of the year." [...] He recalled that both he and Madonna chose to overlook {{the failure of the}} film, and remembered one incident when he met Madonna at a hotel lobby. [...] "She just looked to me once and said, 'So it's a flop right?' That's the only time she ever mentioned the film. Even Sean also never mentioned it in front of her." [...] In another article in The New York Times, Vincent Canby noted that Madonna's real personality is of a [...] "knowing, shrewd, pragmatic young woman, a performer of invigorating energy who still looks a lot like Marilyn Monroe, even with short hair, but who has much more in common with the enthusiastic, unembarrassed, comic tartness of Jean Harlow, somehow let loose on the streets of New York in the 80's." [...] However, he felt that Who's That Girl failed to portray that image, leading to its failure. The first half of the film showed a different personality of Madonna, trying to be comical, which was not accepted by the public.|$|E

Allmusic writer David Jeffries wrote {{that while the}} album [...] "is nothing new" [...] from The Documentary, [...] "the fact remains that every track here {{is as good as}} or better than those on his debut." [...] Entertainment Weekly disagreed, saying [...] "it doesn't live up to the nihilistic brilliance" [...] of his previous album.

[...] He went on to contrast the song from other tracks from J's debut album Who You <b>Are,</b> <b>calling</b> <b>it</b> less aggressive and more [...] "about the positive vibes." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy compared the song to Miley Cyrus's [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] (2009), which was co-written by Jessie J. He said, [...] "Truth be told, 'Price Tag' does come off a little bit corny, but thanks in no small part to Jessie's spunky likability" [...] and described it as a [...] "sun-dappled, hip-hop-inflected midtempo head-nodder".|$|E

On the very high ground next to Birch, you can look down over that lake and I bet it's sixty miles long. It must reach nearly to Teslin Lake." [...] There was something pretty fine in the thought of being in a country where lakes sixty miles long were being discovered and set forth on the maps of the world. Up to this time Atlin Lake itself was unmapped. To an unpractical man like myself it was reward enough to feel the thrill of excitement which comes with such discoveries.|$|E
