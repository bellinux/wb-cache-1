5|$|The {{current flag}} design {{represents}} {{a dramatic change}} {{in the evolution of the}} Portuguese standard, which had always been closely associated with the royal arms, blue and white. Since the country's foundation, the national flag developed from the bluecross-on-white armorial square banner of King Afonso I to the liberal monarchy's <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> a blue-and-white rectangle. In between, major changes associated with determinant political events contributed to its evolution into the current design.|$|E
5|$|James Robinson Planché (27 February 1796 – 30 May 1880) was a British dramatist, antiquary and {{officer of}} <b>arms.</b> <b>Over</b> {{a period of}} {{approximately}} 60 years he wrote, adapted, or collaborated on 176 plays {{in a wide range}} of genres including extravaganza, farce, comedy, burletta, melodrama and opera. Planché was responsible for introducing historically accurate costume into nineteenth century British theatre, and subsequently became an acknowledged expert on historical costume, publishing a number of works on the topic.|$|E

25|$|In 1524 Governor and Captain General Cortés left Mexico City for Honduras {{to march}} against Cristóbal de Olid. He left the {{government}} in charge of Estrada, Albornoz and Zuazo. The transfer of power occurred October 12, 1524. This triumvirate shared power with the ayuntamiento (city government). The three governors soon quarreled. They nearly came to <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> {{the appointment of a}} bailiff.|$|E
25|$|Governor W. Lee O'Daniel stacked the University of Texas Board of Regents with Texas Regulars, a {{practice}} continued with Stevenson. University president Homer Rainey {{was fired in}} 1944 for his continued conflicts with the regents over their firing of professors. Cunningham formed the Women's Committee for Educational Freedom (WCEF) in 1945 as a call to <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> practices of the university regents. Rainey ran for governor in 1946, but lost to Beauford H. Jester.|$|E
25|$|Fejes Tóth met {{his wife}} in university. She was a chemist. They were parents of three children, two sons—one a {{professor}} of mathematics at the Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics, the other a professor of physiology at Dartmouth College—and one daughter, a psychologist. He enjoyed sports, being skilled at table tennis, tennis, and gymnastics. A family photograph shows him swinging by his <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> {{the top of a}} high bar when he was around fifty.|$|E

The lady is caught by her waist {{in the air and}} lands on the {{backward}} outside edge. Some pairs include a split before rotating. This is credited as a difficult feature if each leg is separated by at least a 45° angle from the body axis and the legs are straight or almost straight. Scores are also affected by the height of the twist, turns, steps or other moves before the element, the lady holding her <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> her head, delayed rotation, etc.|$|E
25|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} El Al began to {{schedule}} flights from airports outside of Israel that departed on the Jewish sabbath {{and landed in}} Israel after it had finished. However, the religious parties in the government were in <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> this, being {{that this was a}} violation of Jewish law and contrary to the agreement signed {{in the early days of}} the state, in which El Al promised to refrain from flying on the sabbath. In 1982 the newly re-elected prime minister Menachem Begin, brought before the Knesset a vote to ban Sabbath flights once again (it passed by a vote of 58 to 54). Outraged, the secular community threatened to boycott the airline. In August 1982 El Al workers blocked Orthodox and Hassidic Jews from entering the airport.|$|E
25|$|As {{neither the}} castle nor any {{associated}} drawings by architects involved have survived, {{it is difficult}} to know what Boy's contribution to the structure was. However, surviving financial documents and letters written by the king while he resided elsewhere offer some hints. During his work on the castle in Stockholm, Boy had to supervise hundreds of employees and ensure materials were delivered in proper order, while keeping his demanding king happy. In 1577, repairs on the royal suite were completed. Two years later, stairs were built south of the castle while the northern gate was furnished with a tower adorned with a spire and a stone tablet carrying the royal coat of <b>arms.</b> <b>Over</b> subsequent years, he was involved in various undertakings at the palace, both decorative work and engineering.|$|E

25|$|The presbytery is the centrepiece of the Church of the Azores, {{marked by}} the Bishop's cathedra and choir, {{established}} with {{the founding of the}} Dioceses in 1534, that includes seating for five dignitaries and 12 canons. The triumphal arch is surmounted by a Royal Coat of <b>Arms</b> <b>over</b> the Cross of Christ, symbolizing the concordat between the papacy, the Kingdom of Portugal, and the Order of Christ to expand Catholicism during the Age of Discovery. The retable, made of juniper wood dates to the 17th century, and includes painted figures from the Gospel, while in the middle is a figurative image of the Holy Saviour. Within the choir is the main altar and lateral altars, with the lateral figures of Saint Louis and Saint Elizabeth flanking the main cross. Two doorways provide access to the sacristy, with the larger door accessible to the public.|$|E
25|$|As {{heraldry}} {{is essentially}} a feudal art, {{it was not until}} the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169 that Irish coats of arms came into being, several decades after the art began to take seed in England and continental Europe. The earliest reference to a herald of arms for Ireland was in 1392 on the creation of the first Ireland King of Arms. The Ireland King of Arms, which was under the English College of Arms, was succeeded by an independent Ulster King of Arms, and an Athlone Pursuivant, in 1552, which despite its name had jurisdiction for <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> all of Ireland. In 1943, the Ulster King of Arms was merged with the Norroy King of Arms in England to form the Norroy and Ulster King of Arms. The office of the Chief Herald of Ireland was created as successor to the Ulster King of Arms and the arms of Ireland were registered by the Chief Herald of Ireland on 9 November 1945.|$|E
500|$|Thirty smaller {{figures are}} carved {{on the surface}} of the statue. [...] Many of these are {{positioned}} to mark features on the human body, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth, though some do not obviously correspond with any human feature. [...] The figures are carved in two distinct styles; sixteen of the figures are upright with <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> the torso, while fourteen lie spread-eagled, with arms and legs outstretched. [...] Possibly these two distinct styles of figure are intended to represent male and female forms respectively. [...] These figures are symmetrically distributed across A'a, with the exception of those on the lower abdomen, where there is an upright figure on the right side of A'a and a splayed figure on the left. [...] It is not clear whether this asymmetry was deliberate.|$|E

500|$|In chapter 37 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, Gerðr is {{introduced}} by the enthroned figure of High {{as the daughter of}} Gymir and the mountain jötunn Aurboða, and is described as [...] "the most beautiful of all women". High reports that Freyr went into Hlidskjalf and looked over all worlds. When Freyr looked to the north he saw a distant homestead with a large and magnificent building. A woman went to the building, and when she lifted her arms and {{opened the door to the}} building [...] "light was shed from her <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> both sky and sea, and all worlds were made bright by her". In punishment for [...] "his great presumption" [...] in having sat in the holy seat, Freyr went away filled with grief.|$|E
500|$|The {{granting}} of armorial bearings (coat of arms) within the United Kingdom {{is the sole}} prerogative of the British monarch. However, the monarch has delegated this power to two authorities; the Lord Lyon, with jurisdiction over Scotland and the College of <b>Arms</b> <b>over</b> England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Under the latter's jurisdiction, the right to arms is acquired exclusively either by proving descent in an unbroken male-line from someone registered as so entitled or by a new grant from the King of Arms. These {{are the most common}} way of gaining this right, however technically arms can also be gained: {{by a grant from the}} Crown, by prescription (meaning in use since time immemorial), by succeeding to an office or by marriage. The descent of arms follow strongly the Law of heraldic arms, which is a branch of English law, interpreted by civil lawyers in the Court of Chivalry. Sir Edward Coke in his Commentary upon Littleton (1628) wrote that [...] "gentry and armes is the nature of gavelkinde, for they descend to all the sonnes." [...] Arms in England, therefore descend to all of the male lines, and not just the most senior alone (unlike in Scotland).|$|E
500|$|Sondheim later {{expressed}} {{his view of}} de Mille's directing, calling her [...] "a horror. [...] She treated the actors and singers like dirt and treated the dancers like gods... I think, an extremely insensitive woman, an excellent writer, and a terrible director, in terms of morale, anyway. [...] That was my first experience of bad behavior in the theatre." [...] However, Rufus Smith, who played the minor role of the football coach, stated, [...] "Never again in my life will I experience {{what it is like}} to stop a show cold, by doing exactly what she taught me". [...] The immense job of directing the play finally proved too big for de Mille, who stated [...] "I can't do the new dances and the new songs and the new book," [...] and Hammerstein stepped in to direct the dialogue. [...] According to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest, at this point the cast was up in <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> de Mille's treatment of them. [...] James Mitchell, one of the dancers in the production, later stated that de Mille was better at directing dancers than actors, as actors come to the stage with preconceived notions about how to play a part, and dancers do not.|$|E

50|$|The Dañs tro plinn is a dance whose origin is uncertain.

500|$|In {{a single}} fight {{situation}} the linesmen will {{communicate with each}} other as to which player they will take during the fight, clear out any sticks, gloves, or other equipment that has been dropped and wait for a safe time to enter the fight, which they will do together. [...] If both players are still standing while the linesmen enter, the linesmen will approach from each side (never from behind), bring their <b>arms</b> <b>over</b> the combatants' arms and wrap them around, pushing downwards and breaking the players apart. If the players have fallen, the linesmen will approach from the side (never over the skates), getting in between the two players. One linesman will use his body to shield the player on the bottom from the other player while his partner will remove the top player from the fight. Most linesmen will allow a fight to run its course for their own safety, but will enter a fight regardless if one player has gained a significant advantage over his opponent. Once the players have been broken up, the linesmen then escort the players off the ice. During this time the referee will keep other players from entering the fight by sending them to a neutral area on the ice and then watching the fight and assessing any other penalties that occur.|$|E
