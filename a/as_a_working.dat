5|$|After her audience's {{demand to}} {{continue}} performing similar songs, Gočeva decided {{to record a}} second album in the same musical direction. Makedonsko Devojče 2 is a successor to the album released in 2008 and it contains songs composed in the vein of Macedonian folklore. The plans to record the album were revealed by Gočeva during an interview in May 2012 with the magazine Naš Svet, confirming that she had already begun with the song selection process for the track listing of the second edition of the project Makedonsko Devojče. In {{the initial stages of}} the album's development, Makedonsko Devojče 2 served only <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>working</b> title and later became its official title in order to emphasize that the musical style is {{the same as that of}} Makedonsko Devojče (2008).|$|E
5|$|Following the First World War, it surged in {{popularity}} and {{was associated with}} Hollywood stars {{and members of the}} British Royal Family. Its numbers have dropped significantly since then, with the breed listed as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club; an all-time low was recorded in 2008 when only 43 puppies were registered in the United Kingdom. This decline has been blamed on an influx of foreign and designer breeds, and the Sealyham's reduced usefulness <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>working</b> dog.|$|E

5|$|In 1932, the two cart sheds {{on either}} side of the lane leading into the farm were removed. That year, Councillor T. R. Parker {{purchased}} a plot of land on the site from King's College. Manor Farm continued <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>working</b> farm until the following year, when the local council began to sell off much of the land surrounding the buildings for housing developments. Councillor Parker presented his land to the Ruislip Village Trust as the site of a future public hall, and the Trust passed it to the urban district council in 1964 stipulating that that would be the sole use. The council obliged and the Winston Churchill Hall was built in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Monte Testaccio {{also had}} a {{religious}} significance; it was formerly used on Good Friday to represent the hill of Golgotha in Jerusalem, when the Pope would lead a procession to the summit and placed crosses to represent those of Jesus and the two thieves crucified alongside him. Monte Testaccio is still crowned with a cross in commemoration of the event. It was not until after World War II that {{the area around the}} hill was redeveloped <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>working</b> class neighbourhood.|$|E
5|$|Native ponies {{existed in}} Wales before 1600 BC, and a Welsh-type cob {{was known as}} early as the Middle Ages. They were {{influenced}} by the Arabian horse, and possibly also by the Thoroughbred and the Hackney horse. In 1901, the first stud book for the Welsh breeds was established in the United Kingdom, and in 1907 another registry was established in the United States. Interest in the breed declined during the Great Depression, but revived in the 1950s. Throughout their history, the Welsh breeds have had many uses, including as a cavalry horse, a pit pony, and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>working</b> animal on farms.|$|E

5|$|Pardelup Prison Farm {{opened in}} 1927, near Mount Barker, while Barton's Mill, though {{planned to be}} a {{temporary}} measure, remained open as a prison after World War II. Pardelup operated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>working</b> farm, with a large-scale dairy, cattle and pig raising, and crops, and Barton' Mill prisoners cut timber to supply hospitals, houses, and the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme's pumping station at Mundaring. In both cases, the only aspects resembling a prison were the presence of guards, and the compulsion to remain there – enforced by the remoteness of the facilities {{and the integrity of}} prisoners chosen to be transferred there. Escapees were generally punished with extended sentences at the harsher Fremantle Prison, which had little change over the four decades from 1920 to 1960.|$|E
5|$|Rewley Road, the Oxford {{terminus}} of Harry Verney's Buckinghamshire Railway {{and of the}} Oxford to Cambridge Line, {{closed to}} passengers on 1 October 1951 with trains diverted to the former GWR Oxford General, the current Oxford station. In co-operation with the Science Museum, Rewley Road was dismantled in 1999, the main station building {{and part of the}} platform canopy being moved to Quainton Road for preservation and improved visitor facilities with the main shop and office of the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre, thus maintaining it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>working</b> building. A number of former Ministry of Supply food warehouses in what is now the extended Down Yard have been converted for various uses by the Society, including storage and exhibition of rolling stock.|$|E

5|$|Studies by English Heritage {{have found}} that the site {{originally}} functioned not only as the manorial court hall for Ruislip, but also <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>working</b> farm. The main building was built over two existing structures, possibly to accommodate the new lessee of the manor, Robert Drury, a former Speaker of the House of Commons. The study concluded this was most likely achieved by a team of masons and carpenters. Manor Farm was also known as Ruislip Court until the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The human ear can {{generally}} hear sounds with frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz (the audio range). Sounds {{outside this}} range are considered infrasound (below 20Hz) or ultrasound (above 20kHz) Although hearing requires an intact and functioning auditory {{portion of the}} central nervous system as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>working</b> ear, human deafness (extreme insensitivity to sound) most commonly occurs because of abnormalities of the inner ear, rather than in the nerves or tracts of the central auditory system.|$|E
5|$|The {{main goal}} of the Liber was to {{document}} the landholdings of the diocese and bishop, and to keep a register of the written charters and leases pertaining to {{the property of the}} church at Worcester. Because there is no narrative tying the documents together, the Liber should be seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>working</b> document, compiled {{for the use of the}} bishop and monks, and designed not as a literary work but a legal one. The Liber was revised during its working life, which adds further support for the working nature of the composition.|$|E

5|$|The {{site of the}} {{hospital}} has been in use for 700 years helping the townspeople. There was an Augustinian friary on the site from the thirteenth century, then an almshouse for housing retired freemen, then a soup kitchen was built next to Almshouse in the nineteenth century, before the site acquired its current function <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>working</b> office. The building also serves {{as the basis of}} the Inner City Project of the National Trust. This project takes people of ages 12–25 and over 50 out to the countryside in order to increase appreciation of the city's natural surroundings.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Finnhorse's image <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>working</b> farm horse, {{the breed}} {{was used as}} a cavalry mount from the 17thcentury until the end of World War II. After the {{mechanisation}} of Finnish agriculture in the 1960s and the 1970s, however, it was not clear if the Finnhorse would make the transition into a riding horse, even though the long use of the breed by the Finnish cavalry had proven it well-suited for the job. The Finnhorse had a strong image as a harnessed working horse, associated with rural life and old times. When riding as a hobby emerged and became more established in Finnish cities during the 1960s, imported horses and ponies were preferred as mounts; warmblooded horses represented modern times, leisure time and wealth, while the Finnhorse was viewed as rugged and unsophisticated. The riding section studbook, created in 1971, grew slowly and gained only a few dozen horses during its first decade, as the idea of a Finnhorse used for riding was considered near-ridiculous at the time.|$|E
5|$|During the Queen's tenure {{much has}} been done, not only to restore and {{maintain}} {{the fabric of the}} building, but also to transform it into a major British tourist attraction, containing {{a significant portion of the}} Royal Collection of art, which is managed from Windsor. Archaeological work has continued at the castle, following on from limited investigations in the 1970s, the work on the Round Tower from 1988–92 and the investigations following the 1992 fire. During 2007, 993,000 tourists visited the castle. This has had to be achieved in co-ordination with security issues and the castle's role <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>working</b> royal palace. In late 2011 two large water turbines were installed upstream of the castle on the River Thames to provide hydroelectric power to the castle and the surrounding estate. In April 2016 it was announced that the Royal Collection Trust is to fund a £27m project that will reinstate the original entrance hall of the castle to visitors, as well as a new cafe that will be housed in the 14th Century undercroft. The project will be completed at the end of 2018, and will include a visitor centre and a dedicated learning centre.|$|E

5|$|English {{heraldry}} flourished <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>working</b> art up {{to around}} the 17th century, when it assumed a mainly ceremonial role. The Royal Arms of England continued to embody {{information relating to}} English history. Although the Acts of Union 1707 placed England within the Kingdom of Great Britain, prompting new, British Royal Arms, the Royal Arms of England are still used occasionally in an official capacity, and has continued to endure {{as one of the}} national symbols of England, and has a variety of active uses. For instance, the coats of arms of both The Football Association and the England and Wales Cricket Board have a design featuring three lions passant, based on the historic Royal Arms of England. In 1997 (and again in 2002), the Royal Mint issued a British one pound (£1) coin featuring three lions passant to represent England. To celebrate St George's Day, in 2001, Royal Mail issued first– and second-class postage stamps with the Royal Crest of England (a crowned lion), and the Royal Arms of England (three lions passant) respectively.|$|E
5|$|Fermi's Chicago Pile-1 reactor, {{constructed}} {{under the}} west viewing stands {{of the original}} Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, went critical on December 2, 1942. This graphite-moderated reactor only generated up to 200 W, but it demonstrated that k was higher than anticipated. This not only removed most of the objections to air-cooled and water-cooled reactor designs, it greatly simplified {{other aspects of the}} design. Wigner's team submitted blueprints of a water-cooled reactor to DuPont in January 1943. By this time, the concerns of DuPont's engineers about the corrosiveness of water had been overcome by the mounting difficulties of using helium, and all work on helium was terminated in February. At the same time, air cooling was chosen for the reactor at the pilot plant. Since it would be of a quite different design from the production reactors, the X-10 Graphite Reactor lost its value as a prototype, but its value <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>working</b> pilot facility remained, providing plutonium needed for research. It was hoped that problems would be found in time to deal with them in the production plants. The semiworks would also be used for training, and for developing procedures.|$|E
5|$|The Binding Blade was {{developed}} by Intelligent Systems. It was directed by Tōru Narihiro, and produced by Takehiro Izushi. The designer was Masayuki Horikawa, while programming was handled by Takafumi Kaneko. The scenario was written by Masayuki Horikawa and series newcomer Kouhei Maeda. The character designs were handled by Eiji Kaneda. The music was composed by Yuka Tsujiyoko, who had worked on every title in the series up to that point. The Binding Blade began development as Fire Emblem: Maiden of Darkness, a Fire Emblem title intended for the Nintendo 64 and its peripheral 64DD. This version was revealed in 1997 by Shigeru Miyamoto under the working title Fire Emblem 64. When they were well into the development of Maiden of Darkness, the internal development structure at Intelligent Systems was changed, which combined with the poor sales of the 64DD resulted in the game's development being restarted in 2000 for the Game Boy Advance (GBA). Very little of the original Nintendo 64 game concept survived the transition. Aside from the characters Roy and Karel, most of the original game's characters were scrapped. The subtitle Maiden of Darkness remained in use <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>working</b> title up until 2001, when it became The Binding Blade. Production on {{the final version of}} The Binding Blade took approximately one year.|$|E
