5000|$|A Bayesian {{estimate}} {{places the}} evolution of the alveolate group at ~. The Alveolata consist of Myzozoa, Ciliates, and Colponemids. In other words, the term Myzozoa, meaning [...] "to siphon the contents from prey", may be applied informally to the common ancestor of the subset of alveolates that are neither ciliates nor colponemids. Predation upon algae is an important driver in alveolate evolution, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> sources for endosymbiosis of novel plastids. The term Myzozoa is therefore a handy concept for tracking the history of the alveolate phylum.|$|E

50|$|Many cuckoos are obligate brood parasites, {{meaning they}} only lay eggs in other birds' nests and never {{take care of}} their own young. Birds that do this, such as the common cuckoo or the brown-headed cowbird, lay {{relatively}} small eggs because their expected hosts are usually smaller birds. Cuckoos in the genus Coccyzus, lay relatively large eggs even though they still parasitize smaller birds. Yellow warblers are the smallest birds recorded caring for black-billed cuckoo eggs. In experiments, these wood warblers were found to accept the cuckoo eggs 63% of the time even though their own eggs are only a quarter of the size. Even with the size difference, the warbler parent is often still able to raise the cuckoo as long <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> the chick with sufficient nutrition and incubation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} [...] "spiritual crisis" [...] has mainly sprung {{from the work}} of transpersonal psychologists and psychiatrists whose view of the psyche {{stretches}} beyond that of Western psychology. Transpersonalists tend to focus less on psychopathology and more unidirectionally toward enlightenment and ideal mental health (Walsh & Vaughan, 1993). However, this emphasis on spirituality's potentials and health benefits has been criticized. According to James (1902), a spiritual orientation focusing only on positive themes is incomplete, as it fails to address evil and suffering (Pargament et al., 2004). Scholarly attention to spiritual struggle is therefore timely <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> greater balance to the empirical literature and increase understanding of everyday spirituality. Another reason for the study of spiritual crisis is that growth often occurs through suffering (e.g., Tedeschi, Park, & Calhoun, 1998). As such, neglecting problems of suffering might result in neglecting vital sources of spiritual transformation and development (Paloutzian, 2005).|$|E
50|$|This genus has a {{long history}} with mankind. Cave {{paintings}} of these bees have been found in Valencia, Spain that date back to the Paleolithic era (suspicious, as Valencia is well away from the Apis dorsata range; probably some other Apis species). In modern times, since large amounts of honey (up to 45 kilograms) can be stored in the nests of Apis dorsata, many people frequently harvest their nests. Honey represents a livelihood for some of these people <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> them with an important source of income. However, deforestation, urbanization, pesticides, and honey hunting have threatened local populations of bees and their honey. These bees are known to be aggressive, and they have the potential to viciously sting humans. In fact, they are known as “Hejjenu” in Karnataka, India due to their aggressive behavior, large colonies, and painful stings. At least one fatal defensive attack on a human has been reported.|$|E

50|$|While 16S hypervariable regions {{can vary}} {{dramatically}} between bacteria, the 16S gene {{as a whole}} maintains greater length homogeneity than its Eukaryotic counterpart, which can make alignments easier. Additionally, the 16S gene contains highly conserved sequences between hypervariable regions, enabling the design of universal primers that can reliably produce the same sections of the 16S sequence across different taxa. Although no hypervariable region can accurately classify all bacteria from Domain to Species, some can reliably predict specific taxonomic levels. Many community studies select semi-conserved hypervariable regions like the V4 for this reason, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> resolution at the phylum level as accurately as the full 16S gene. While lesser-conserved regions struggle to classify new species when higher order taxonomy is unknown, they are often used to detect the presence of specific pathogens. In one study by Chakravorty et al. in 2007, they characterized the V1-V8 regions {{of a variety of}} pathogens in order to determine which hypervariable regions would be most useful to include for disease-specific and broad assays. Amongst other findings, they noted that the V3 region was best at identifying the genus for all pathogens tested, and that V6 was the most accurate at differentiating species between all CDC-watched pathogens tested, including Anthrax.|$|E

By creating fanciful genealogies, linking Lithuanians with noble Romans, the Lithuanian nobility could counter these claims and demand political independence.|$|R
