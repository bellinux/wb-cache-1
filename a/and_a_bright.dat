As they drive on the highway, the agents are surrounded by Jeeps carrying soldiers led by a Man in Black named Morris Fletcher (Michael McKean). A rumbling noise is heard as a mysterious craft flies overhead <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> light from the object passes over them. Mulder and Fletcher find that their minds have been swapped into each other's bodies, but nobody else present is aware of this. Fletcher and Scully depart, watched by the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Max Fenig (Scott Bellis), {{last seen}} in Fallen Angel, is {{traveling}} on an airplane, Flight 549, which flies over upstate New York.

5|$|This kinglet has greenish upper-parts, whitish under-parts, and has {{two white}} wingbars. It has a plain face {{contrasting}} black irises <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> head crest, orange and yellow in the male and yellow in the female, which is displayed during breeding. It superficially resembles the firecrest, which largely shares its European range, but the latter's bronze shoulders and strong face pattern are distinctive. The song is a repetition of high thin notes, slightly higher-pitched than those of its relative. Birds on the Canary Islands are now separated into two subspecies of the goldcrest, but were formerly {{considered to be a}} subspecies of the common firecrest or a separate species, Regulus teneriffae.|$|E
5|$|Once the commandos {{finally got}} out of the tunnel, they both swam towards the {{broadside}} of Card which anchored near the opening of the sewer. As planned, Nao and Hung attached two bombs on the ship, with one near the bilge and one at the engine compartment, just above the water surface. After the bombs had been attached to Cards hull, Nao inspected both bombs to ensure they had been assembled properly. After that Nao stuck the battery onto a pole and connected it to the bombs with wires, then set the timer. At 1.10am, the bombs were completed and both commandos retreated back into the sewer tunnel, and climbed into their canoes {{on the other side and}} rowed back to Thu Thiem. Again, the police patrol boat was waiting for Nao and Hung to arrive, because the commander wanted another bribe. As Nao and Hung approached the patrol boat, an explosion was heard <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> light could be seen in the commercial port area. The South Vietnamese police patrol boat than started its engine and raced towards Card, instead of extracting another bribe.|$|E
5|$|NGC 678 and NGC 680 are a pair {{of galaxies}} in Aries that are only about 200,000 light-years apart. Part of the NGC 691 group of galaxies, both are at a {{distance}} of approximately 130 million light-years. NGC 678 is an edge-on spiral galaxy that is 4.5 by 0.8 arcminutes. NGC 680, an elliptical galaxy with an asymmetrical boundary, is the brighter of the two at magnitude 12.9; NGC 678 has a magnitude of 13.35. Both galaxies have bright cores, but NGC 678 is the larger galaxy at a diameter of 171,000 light-years; NGC 680 has a diameter of 72,000 light-years. NGC 678 is further distinguished by its prominent dust lane. NGC 691 itself is a spiral galaxy slightly inclined to our line of sight. It has multiple spiral arms <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> core. Because it is so diffuse, it has a low surface brightness. It has a diameter of 126,000 light-years and is 124 million light-years away. NGC 877 is the brightest member of an 8-galaxy group that also includes NGC 870, NGC 871, and NGC 876, with a magnitude of 12.53. It is 2.4 by 1.8 arcminutes and is 178 million light-years away with a diameter of 124,000 light-years. Its companion is NGC 876, which is about 103,000 light-years from the core of NGC 877. They are interacting gravitationally, as they are connected by a faint stream of gas and dust. Arp 276 is a different pair of interacting galaxies in Aries, consisting of NGC 935 and IC 1801.|$|E

25|$|M94, also {{classified}} as NGC 4736, is a face-on spiral galaxy 15 million light-years from Earth. It has very tight spiral arms <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> core. The {{outskirts of the}} galaxy are incredibly luminous in the ultraviolet because of a ring of new stars surrounding the core, 7,000 light-years in diameter. Though astronomers are not sure what has caused this ring of new stars, some hypothesize that it is from shock waves caused by a bar that is thus far invisible.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{took off}} from Lahug Airport for Nichols Field, around 640 kilometers away near Manila, at 1:00:00 AM, Sunday, March 17. The weather was fine and the ceiling unlimited with low broken clouds <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> moon. Eyewitnesses on the ground observed that the airplane had not gained enough altitude as it approached the mountain ranges in Balamban. At 01:17:00 AM, the plane radioed the official presidential home, Malacañang, to have the President fetched at Nichols Field at around 03:15 AM. This communication was the last ever conveyed by the plane.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} compete in {{international}} rallying, the car had to be homologated; for Group 4, the class the HS was {{to compete in}}, this meant building 400 production vehicles for public sale. Vauxhall created a far more powerful Chevette variant by fitting the 2.3litre slant-four engine, using a 16-valve cylinder head which Vauxhall was developing - though the rally cars used the Lotus 16-valve head until a rule change by the FIA banned them in 1978. Fitted with two Stromberg carburettors the engine developed 135 bhp. Suspension and rear axle were from the Opel Kadett C GT/E and the gearbox was a Getrag five-speed. Chevrolet Vega alloy wheels (similar in appearance to the Avon wheels used on the droopsnoot Firenza) were used, {{as well as a}} newly developed glass-reinforced plastic air dam. The result was a very fast and well handling, if rather unrefined, road car. Like the Droopsnoot Firenza, the HS was available only in silver, with red highlighting <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> red, black and tartan interior; though (partly to help sell unsold vehicles) some cars were repainted in other colours, such the black Mamos Garage HS-X.|$|E

25|$|Females {{can reach}} 12mm body length, males 7 to 11mm. Both sexes have blue-green {{iridescent}} chelicerae, a black cephalothorax and limbs, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> red abdomen {{with a median}} black stripe (similar to the female P. johnsoni). Between the black and red areas on the posterior part of the dorsal abdomen there are two minute white spots. At {{the sides of the}} abdomen there are light diagonal bands, and there is also a light transverse anterior band on the dorsum. These markings vary in conspicuousness: the bands and spots may be only a somewhat lighter shade of red than the remainder of the abdomen, while the median black stripe may be so reduced in width and length that the abdomen appears solid red. Sometimes, the basic color is orange rather than red, and very old spiders may even be yellow. In this species, the adult males and the adult females are similar in coloration, and this is also true of P. apacheanus. It is more usual for the males of Phidippus to have iridescent chelicerae and a distinctive adult coloration while the females of this genus remain similar to the immature spiders (e.g., P. clarus, P. octopunctatus, P. whitmani).|$|E

500|$|Johnston, {{known to}} his friends as Dave, was commemorated by both his fellow {{scientists}} and by the government. Known for his diligent and particular nature, he was called [...] "an exemplary scientist" [...] by a USGS dedication paper, which also described him as [...] "unaffectedly genuine, with an infectious curiosity and enthusiasm". He was quick to [...] "dissipate cynicism" [...] and believed that [...] "careful evaluation and interpretation" [...] was the best approach to his work. [...] An obituary notice for Johnston stated {{that at the time}} of his death he had been [...] "among the leading young volcanologists in the world" [...] and that his [...] "enthusiasm and warmth" [...] would be [...] "missed at least as much as his scientific strength". Co-worker Andrew Alden states that Johnston had great potential, declaring that he [...] "had many friends <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> future". Following the eruption, Harry Glicken and other geologists at the USGS dedicated their work to Johnston.|$|E
500|$|The Australian magpie {{produces}} {{a clutch of}} two to five light blue or greenish eggs, which are oval in shape and about [...] The chicks hatch synchronously around 20 days after incubation begins; like all passerines, the chicks are altricial—they are born pink, naked, and blind with large feet, a short broad beak <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bright</b> red throat. Their eyes are fully open at around 10 days. Chicks develop fine downy feathers on their head, back and wings in the first week, and pinfeathers in the second week. The black and white colouration is noticeable from an early stage. Nestlings are fed exclusively by the female, though the male magpie will feed his partner. The Australian magpie is known to engage in cooperative breeding, and helper birds will assist in feeding and raising young. This does vary from region to region, and {{with the size of}} the group—the behaviour is rare or nonexistent in pairs or small groups.|$|E
