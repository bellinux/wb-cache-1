5|$|Over ten Han-era {{underground}} tombs {{have been}} found, {{many of them}} featuring archways, vaulted chambers, and domed roofs. Underground vaults and domes did not require buttress supports since they were {{held in place by}} earthen pits. The use of brick vaults and domes in <b>aboveground</b> Han structures is unknown.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} twenty-nine monumental brick or stone-carved pillar-gates (que) from the Han dynasty have survived {{and can be}} found in the <b>aboveground</b> areas around Han tomb and shrine sites. They often formed part of outer walls, usually {{flanking}} an entry but sometimes at the corners of walled enclosures. Although they lack wooden and ceramic components, they feature imitation roof tiles, eaves, porches, and balustrades.|$|E
5|$|The {{basement}} {{rooms at}} Wappocomo are located almost entirely <b>aboveground.</b> The house's foundation is constructed of large stone blocks, into which was crafted a large open fireplace that once exhibited a swinging iron chimney crane. The space around this large open fireplace within the mansion's basement formerly {{served as a}} kitchen, {{where most of the}} cooking and food preparation took place. Entry into the home's basement is accessible through a wide and heavy exterior door.|$|E
5|$|While {{walking around}} her house, Thea finds a map {{in her room}} of Gracehope. The map shows a tunnel leading onto the surface. Thea and her cousin Mattias find the tunnel and meet Peter who helps them back to Gracehope. Reaching Gracehope, Peter realizes that several talismans {{of the people are}} in the shape of {{mitochondrial}} DNA, which his mom is studying. After waking up from a headache, Peter finds his mom next to his bed. She explains that she used to live in Gracehope, but was banished with her sister, after her sister ventured above the surface and contracted an illness that could not be cured. She also explains that her research of mitochondrial DNA relates to the ability of mutations to benefit the human body, which could cause their extremely good vision and hearing. In the end, she warns Peter that global warming is causing Gracehope to slowly melt away. The entire colony must learn the dangers they face and escape. One obstacle lies in their way: Rowen, Thea and Peter's grandmother who banished Peter's mom and did nothing to help Thea's mom when she was on her deathbed from an illness when she ventured <b>aboveground.</b> Rowen {{is the head of the}} Council in Gracehope and is strictly against going <b>aboveground.</b>|$|E
5|$|Attalea {{is a large}} genus of palms {{native to}} Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America. This pinnately leaved, non-spiny genus {{includes}} both small palms lacking an <b>aboveground</b> stem and large trees. The genus has a complicated taxonomic history, and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers. Since the genera can only be distinguished {{on the basis of}} their male flowers, the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument for keeping them all in the same genus. This has been supported by a recent molecular phylogeny.|$|E
5|$|The {{layout of}} tombs {{dug into the}} sides of {{mountains}} typically had a front chamber, side chambers, and a rear chambers designed to imitate a complex of <b>aboveground</b> halls. The tomb of King Liu Sheng (d. 113 BCE) in Hebei province not only had a front hall with window drapes and grave goods, carriages and horses in the southern separate side chamber, and storage goods in the northern side chamber, but also the remains of real timber houses with tiled roofs erected within (along with a house made of stone slabs and two stone doors in the rear chamber). Doors made completely out of stone were found in many Han tombs as well as tombs in later dynasties.|$|E
5|$|Timber was {{the chief}} {{building}} material in Han architecture. It was used for grand palace halls, multi-story towers, multi-story residential halls, and humble abodes. However, due to wood's rapid decay over time and susceptibility to fire, the oldest wooden buildings found in China (i.e. several temple halls of Mount Wutai) date no earlier than the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE). Architectural historian Robert L. Thorp describes the scarcity of Han-era archaeological remains, {{as well as the}} often unreliable Han-era literary and artistic sources used by historians for clues about non-existent Han architecture. What remains of Han-dynasty architecture are ruins of brick and rammed earth walls (including <b>aboveground</b> city walls and underground tomb walls), rammed earth platforms for terraced altars and halls, funerary stone or brick pillar-gates, and scattered ceramic roof tiles that once adorned timber halls. Sections of the Han-era rammed earth Great Wall still exist in Gansu province, along with the Han frontier ruins of thirty beacon towers and two fortified castles with crenellations. Han walls of frontier towns and forts in Inner Mongolia were typically constructed with stamped clay bricks instead of rammed earth.|$|E

25|$|Newer <b>aboveground</b> {{stations}} (particularly Alewife, Braintree, and Quincy Adams, {{which all}} have large parking garages) are excellent examples of brutalist architecture.|$|E
25|$|Propagative roots: {{roots that}} form {{adventitious}} buds that develop into <b>aboveground</b> shoots, termed suckers, which form new plants, as in Canada thistle, cherry and many others.|$|E
25|$|Some {{fish species}} that live {{buried in the}} bottom of <b>aboveground</b> waters, live deep in the sea or in deep rivers have adaptations similar to cavefish, {{including}} reduced eyes and pigmentation.|$|E
25|$|In an {{experiment}} where {{the effect of}} arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization on plant decomposition was tested, only <b>aboveground</b> plant material {{was found to have}} decomposed faster after 3 months while root decomposition remained unchanged, even though arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are confined to roots.|$|E
25|$|In {{metropolitan}} areas, {{stray voltage}} issues {{have become a}} major concern. Many of these areas have large amounts of aging underground and <b>aboveground</b> electrical distribution equipment in crowded public spaces. Even a low rate of insulation failures or current leakage can result in hazardous exposure of the general public.|$|E
25|$|Two {{stairs and}} an elevator, {{from each of}} the Flushing Line platforms, lead down to an <b>aboveground</b> landing, whereupon a set of stairs leads to the main station house, which also {{contains}} the station agent booth. The Flushing-bound platform's elevator leads from the Flushing-bound platform to the <b>aboveground</b> landing, then to the street level fare control, and finally to a landing between the street level and the belowground Queens Boulevard Line mezzanine. The full-time station agent booth, and two banks of turnstiles for fare control, are located in this station house at street level. Two escalators also lead directly from the Flushing Line landing to the Queens Boulevard Line mezzanine. From the mezzanine, various stairs lead down to each of the Queens Boulevard Line platforms, and an elevator from the belowground landing leads to the mezzanine and the Manhattan-bound platform. There is another elevator from the Forest Hills- and Jamaica-bound platform to the mezzanine. There are also some stores and an ATM lining the mezzanine within fare control.|$|E
25|$|The Achewood Underground is an {{underground}} {{version of the}} human city above, inhabited and run by animals both stuffed and real, {{as well as several}} robots. The underground has its own businesses and establishments that parallel those above ground, and its inhabitants often steal or borrow things from their human counterparts <b>aboveground.</b> Aside from Achewood, it is assumed that most cities around the world have their own undergrounds as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{black-footed ferret}} is solitary, except when {{breeding}} or raising litters. It is nocturnal and primarily hunts for sleeping prairie dogs in their burrows. It is most active above ground from dusk to midnight and 4 a.m. to mid-morning. <b>Aboveground</b> activity is greatest during {{late summer and}} early autumn when juveniles become independent. Climate generally does not limit black-footed ferret activity, but it may remain inactive inside burrows for up to 6 {{days at a time}} during winter.|$|E
25|$|With {{plants like}} common {{dandelion}} and goatsbeard, all <b>aboveground</b> {{parts of the}} plant were sometimes eaten. The stems, however, were not of main importance. The reproductive parts, mainly buds, flowers, and capsules, were the only parts taken {{from some of the}} other species. Conversely, leaves were the only parts of sagebrush found in the crops. Leaves and flowers of the species listed above and other dicots contained higher amounts of crude protein, calcium, and phosphorus than sagebrush and may be important in greater sage-grouse diets for these reasons.|$|E
25|$|Each Nike battery {{consisted}} {{of two or three}} areas; IFC, LA and general. The LA consisted to a maximum of four launching sections, each section {{consisted of}} an underground storage area, an elevator to move missiles to and from the surface launchers, and four <b>aboveground</b> firing locations. One of these locations was directly above the elevator, the others were reached by manually pushing the missiles off the elevator to the launcher along rails. The LA also had a control van to control and monitor the LA activities and maintenance facilities.|$|E
25|$|In June 1932, John G. Barnard {{founded the}} Modern Welding Company {{in a small}} {{building}} located near the Ohio River at First and Frederica Streets where the Commonwealth of Kentucky office building sits today. Today, Modern Welding Company has nine steel tank and vessel fabrication subsidiaries located throughout the United States, and five welding supply stores located in Kentucky and Indiana. The company is the country's largest supplier of underground and <b>aboveground</b> steel storage tanks for flammable and combustible liquids. The company celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The RDV/Christman Michigan Street Development is an {{integrated}} series of mixed-use buildings constructed {{along the north}} side of Michigan Street spanning between Division Avenue to Coit Avenue. It was a $250 million project that is jointly owned by RDV Corp. and The Christman Company, collectively known as Michigan Street Development, LLC. Several properties were acquired by the partnership: a State of Michigan surface parking lot, the Towers Building, an <b>aboveground</b> parking structure, a private practice medical building, and a Burger King. All of these were razed in preparation for the new facilities. Numerous tax incentives allowed financing of the development to become finalized.|$|E
25|$|The World Trade Center Transportation Hub is the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's formal {{name for}} the new PATH station and the {{associated}} transit and retail complex that opened on March 3, 2016. The station's renaming took place when the station reopened. It was designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava and composed of a train station with a large and open mezzanine under the National September 11 Memorial plaza. This mezzanine is connected to an <b>aboveground</b> head house structure called the Oculus—located between 2 World Trade Center and 3 World Trade Center—as well as to public concourses under the various towers in the World Trade Center complex.|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} {{official}} {{maps of the}} subway system are not geographically accurate due {{to the complexity of}} the system (e.g., Manhattan being the smallest borough, but having the most services), but are known to help tourists navigate the city, as major city streets are shown alongside the subway stations serving them. However, the New York City Subway map is an anomaly among subway maps around the world, in that it shows city streets, parks, and neighborhoods juxtaposed among curved subway lines, whereas other subway maps (like the London Underground map) do not show such <b>aboveground</b> features and show subway lines as straight and at 45- or 90-degree angles.|$|E
25|$|Residents also {{complained that}} the parking lots {{opposite}} the Crescent were unsightly, and that they {{found it difficult to}} find parking downtown. The plan recommends creating a village green on part of the lot at the southwest corner of Main and Spring streets, outside the district, as a focal point of downtown. It could retain parking along the sides or even in a garage underneath, a common practice in Europe. Further parking could be added in an <b>aboveground</b> garage on Brandreth Street, outside of downtown. The village should also act to create a consistent downtown environment by encouraging infill development, making signage and lighting consistent, and strengthening and consistently enforcing its historic preservation guidelines.|$|E
25|$|On 12 September 1944, Oldendorf {{commanded}} {{from the}} bridge of his flagship, , the Fire Support Group tasked with the bombardment of Peleliu in the Palaus island group. This Fire Support Group consisted of five battleships, the , , , , and , eight cruisers, twelve destroyers, seven minesweepers, fifteen landing craft converted to rocket launchers, and a half-dozen submarines. At this point in his career, Oldendorf was an experienced battle commander who had handled similar assignments in three previous Marine landings. The bombardment was scheduled to last 3 days. By {{the end of the first}} day, aerial reconnaissance photos indicated that close to 300 of the assigned targets had been destroyed or seriously damaged by the all-day bombardment and that virtually every <b>aboveground</b> structure and fortification had been wiped out. At the airport its few usable planes were reduced to wreckage.|$|E
25|$|The {{horizontal}} distribution of springtail species {{is affected by}} environmental factors which act at the landscape scale, such as soil acidity, moisture and light. Requirements for pH can be reconstructed experimentally. Altitudinal changes in species distribution can be at least partly explained by increased acidity at higher elevation. Moisture requirements, among other ecological and behavioural factors, explain why some species cannot live <b>aboveground,</b> or retreat in the soil during dry seasons, but also why some epigeal springtails are always found {{in the vicinity of}} ponds and lakes, such as the hygrophilous Isotomurus palustris. Adaptive features, such as the presence of a fan-like wettable mucro, allow some species to move at the surface of water (Sminthurides aquaticus, Sminthurides malmgreni). Podura aquatica, a unique representative of the family Poduridae (and one of the first springtails to have been described by Linnaeus), spends its entire life at the surface of water, its wettable eggs dropping in water until the non-wettable first instar hatches then surfaces.|$|E
25|$|The {{entirety}} of the 4.7 mile-long Route 132-A {{was to be}} constructed underground through tunneling and cut-and-cover. Station mezzanines; the line north of 92nd Street, where the rock profile drops away sharply; and the area around 48th Street, {{where there is a}} crevice in the rock profile, would be constructed using cut-and-cover. The temporary decking of Second Avenue was required for this construction to take place and to allow for traffic <b>aboveground</b> to proceed. The remaining portions of the line were to be built through tunneling. Only one business relocation was planned for the construction of the line. A gas station at the southeast corner of 63rd Street and Second Avenue was to be relocated as the site needed to be used for a construction and ventilation shaft, in addition to being used for a permanent ventilation superstructure. Underground easements were to be required under thirteen properties in the vicinity of 63rd Street. Compared to other subway lines, the Second Avenue line was going to be much quieter.|$|E
25|$|Problems soon developed, and the {{mausoleum}} site became {{the target of}} vandals. As a preventative measure, the entrance was bricked up to prevent access, but the wall was breached in 1956. By 1958 the church vestry became concerned, and in 1962 refused to grant permission for any more {{work to be done}} on the site. Soon negotiations began to break the original contract; in 1968 the property reverted to the church, and Remey was given five years to remove anything of value from the site. Most of the dead were taken by relatives to another family cemetery in New York; Remey's wife Gertrude was reinterred in the main church cemetery. After the last of the bodies were removed, the Remeum was demolished beginning in 1973, and the last of the <b>aboveground</b> ruins was finally bulldozed ten years later. Little remains on the site to mark the former presence of the complex save an obelisk dedicated to Remey's parents and a pair of structures which served as chimneys or vents. Urban legends about the site persist, describing parties in the crypts below {{the mausoleum}}.|$|E
25|$|On 30 April, after {{receiving}} news of Hitler's suicide, orders were issued {{that those who}} could do so were to break out. The plan was to escape from Berlin to the Allies {{on the western side}} of the Elbe or to the German Army to the North. Prior to the breakout, Mohnke briefed all commanders (who could be reached) within the Zitadelle sector about the events as to Hitler's death and the planned break out. They split up into ten main groups on 1 May 1945. Mohnke's group included: secretary Traudl Junge, secretary Gerda Christian, secretary Else Krüger, Hitler's dietician, Constanze Manziarly, Ernst-Günther Schenck, Walther Hewel and various others. Mohnke planned to break out towards the German Army which was positioned in Prinzenallee. The group headed along the subway but their route was blocked so they went <b>aboveground</b> and later joined hundreds of other Germans civilians and military personnel who had sought refuge at the Schultheiss-Patzenhofer Brewery on Prinzenallee. On 2 May 1945, General Weidling issued an order calling for the complete surrender of all German forces still in Berlin. Knowing they could not get through the Soviet rings, Mohnke decided to surrender to the Red Army. However, several of Mohnke's group (including some of the SS personnel) opted to commit suicide.|$|E
500|$|While {{some species}} are single-stemmed, others form multi-stemmed (caespitose) clumps. [...] Coupled with {{variation}} in stem size, this produces {{a diversity of}} growth forms in the genus—solitary (single-stemmed) palms that grow into the subcanopy of the forest, solitary or caespitose palms that grow in the forest understorey and acaulescent palms which lack an <b>aboveground</b> stem.|$|E
500|$|Seed {{germination}} is remote tubular—during germination, as the cotyledon expands {{it pushes}} the young shoot {{away from the}} seed. After germination, the stem initially grows downward before turning to grow upward and produce the <b>aboveground</b> stem. This produces a [...] "saxophone shaped" [...] belowground portion of the stem. The fact that the shoot tips of Attalea seedlings are underground it likely to contribute to their fire-tolerance.|$|E
500|$|The genus Attalea has pinnately {{compound}} leaves—rows of leaflets emerge {{on either}} side of the axis of the leaf in a feather-like or fern-like pattern. Species are also non-spiny palms and includes both large trees with stout stems up to [...] tall and acaulescent palms (one which lack an <b>aboveground</b> stem). The number of leaves per individual varies from about three to thirty-five; larger plants tend to have more and longer leaves.|$|E
500|$|Since 2015, {{there have}} been three blizzard-related subway shutdowns. On January 26, 2015, another full closure was ordered by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo due to the January 2015 nor'easter, which was {{originally}} projected to leave New York City with [...] of snow. The next day, the subway system was partially reopened. A number of New York City residents criticized Cuomo's decision to shut down the subway system {{for the first time ever}} due to snow. The nor'easter dropped much less snow in the city than originally expected, totaling only [...] in Central Park. On January 23, 2016, a partial subway closure was ordered due to the January 2016 United States blizzard, wherein all <b>aboveground</b> stations were closed; the underground lines remained open during the blizzard. Most of the subway resumed service the next day, with some lingering delays due to an average of [...] of snow in the area. On March 13, 2017, another partial subway closure of all <b>aboveground</b> stations was ordered for the next day due to the March 2017 nor'easter, which was forecast to bring up to [...] of snow to the area.|$|E
500|$|By location: A {{frequently}} used distinction considers whether processing is done {{above or below}} ground, and classifies the technologies broadly as ex situ (displaced) or in situ (in place). [...] In ex situ processing, also known as above-ground retorting, the oil shale is mined either underground or at the surface and then transported to a processing facility. [...] In contrast, in situ processing converts the kerogen while it {{is still in the}} form of an oil shale deposit, following which it is then extracted via oil wells, where it rises in the same way as conventional crude oil. [...] Unlike ex situ processing, it does not involve mining or spent oil shale disposal <b>aboveground</b> as spent oil shale stays underground.|$|E
500|$|The {{death cap}} {{has a large}} and {{imposing}} epigeous (<b>aboveground)</b> fruiting body (basidiocarp), usually with a pileus (cap) from [...] across, initially rounded and hemispherical, but flattening with age. The color of the cap can be pale-, yellowish-, or olive-green, often paler toward the margins and often paler after rain. The cap surface is sticky when wet and easily peeled, a troublesome feature, as that is allegedly a feature of edible fungi. The remains of the partial veil {{are seen as a}} skirtlike, floppy annulus usually about [...] below the cap. The crowded white lamellae (gills) are free. The stipe is white with a scattering of grayish-olive scales and is [...] long and [...] thick, with a swollen, ragged, sac-like white volva (base). As the volva, which may be hidden by leaf litter, is a distinctive and diagnostic feature, it is important to remove some debris to check for it.|$|E
500|$|By the 1980s, {{over ten}} {{thousand}} brick-and-stone underground Han tombs {{had been discovered}} throughout China. Earlier Chinese tombs dating to the Warring States were often vertically dug pits lined with wooden walls. In digging the tomb sites, Han workers would first build vertical pits and then dig laterally, hence the name [...] "horizontal pits" [...] for Han tombs; this method was also used for tomb sites dug into the sides of mountains. The walls of most Western Han tombs were built of large hollow bricks while the smaller, non-hollow brick type that dominated Eastern Han tomb architecture (with some made out of stone) appeared in the late Western Han. The smaller brick type was better-suited for Han tomb archways at entrances, vaulted chambers, and domed roofs. Underground vaults and domes did not require buttress supports since they were {{held in place by}} earthen pits. The use of brick vaults and domes in <b>aboveground</b> Han structures is unknown.|$|E
