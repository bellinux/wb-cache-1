5|$|Artifact is a 2012 American {{documentary}} film. It {{was directed}} by Jared Leto under the pseudonym of Bartholomew Cubbins, and produced by Leto and Emma Ludbrook. Artifact chronicles the modern music business as it charts the legal dispute between Leto's rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars and record label EMI, which filed a $30 million breach of contract lawsuit <b>against</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> 2008, after the band tried to exit its contract over a royalties dispute. Thirty Seconds to Mars is shown working with producer Flood to create the 2009 album This Is War, meeting with lawyers between recording sessions.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh's {{interests}} in the area were damaged when de Courcy lost his territory in eastern Ulster to his rival Hugh de Lacy in 1203. John de Courcy, with help from his wife's brother King Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson (Raghnall mac Gofraidh) and perhaps from Donnchadh, tried to regain his principality, but was initially unsuccessful. De Courcy's fortunes were boosted when Hugh de Lacy (then Earl of Ulster) and his associate William III de Briouze, themselves fell foul of John; the king campaigned in Ireland <b>against</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> 1210, a campaign that forced de Briouze to return to Wales and de Lacy to flee to St Andrews in Scotland.|$|E

5|$|In the {{transfer}} market, {{the most significant}} signings were of 28-year-old Quim, Portugal's second-choice goalkeeper, to compete with incumbent starter José Moreira. Defender Takis Fyssas also saw {{the arrival of a}} competitor, former Marseille player Manuel dos Santos. Benfica also signed Norwegian striker Azar Karadas after his compelling performance <b>against</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the previous season's UEFA Cup with Rosenborg. The most significant departure was Tiago, who moved to Chelsea for a fee that Record announced was around €12 million. Other than him, only Armando Sá and Hélder Cristóvão were regularly used, and both continued their careers abroad, with Villarreal and Paris Saint-Germain respectively.|$|E
5|$|One {{isolated}} Covenanter brigade {{that stood}} its ground {{was at the}} right of their front line and consisted of the regiments of the Earl of Crawford-Lindsay and Viscount Maitland. Lucas launched three cavalry charges <b>against</b> <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> the third charge, Lucas's horse was killed, and he was taken prisoner. Behind them, Lumsden reformed the reserve of the allied centre, pushing four regiments (those of the Earl of Cassilis, William Douglas of Kilhead, Lord Coupar and the Earl of Dunfermline) and part of the Clydesdale Regiment forward into the breach in the allied front line. Behind them in turn, the Earl of Manchester's regiment repulsed and scattered Blakiston's brigade.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund Báthory abdicated at the Diet in Medgyes (Mediaș, Romania) on 21 March and {{proposed}} Andrew his successor.

5|$|After a tag team match, {{which they}} lost, on the August 19 episode of SmackDown, Fox was {{attacked}} by Natalya, which provoked a feud between the two. She began acting as a face while wrestling alongside several different Divas to face Natalya and Beth Phoenix, collectively known as The Divas of Doom, in tag team matches, and also regularly competing <b>against</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> singles matches. As part of the storyline, Fox also prevented Natalya and Phoenix from attacking other Divas, including Kelly Kelly and AJ. The storyline continued sporadically throughout {{the first half of}} 2012, with Fox losing tag team and singles matches to Phoenix and Natalya. Fox spent the remainder of 2012 and early 2013 competing in sporadic matches, usually on the losing side. In mid–2013, Fox appeared on the rebooted WWE NXT, entering a tournament to determine the inaugural NXT Women's Champion, where she defeated Bayley in the first round, but lost to Paige in the semi-finals.|$|E
5|$|Catherine's {{three sons}} reigned {{in an age}} of almost {{constant}} civil and religious war in France. The problems facing the monarchy were complex and daunting but Catherine was able to keep the monarchy and the state institutions functioning even at a minimum level. At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Protestants, or Huguenots, as they became known. She failed, however, to grasp the theological issues that drove their movement. Later she resorted, in frustration and anger, to hard-line policies <b>against</b> <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> return, she came to be blamed for the excessive persecutions carried out under her sons' rule, in particular for the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572, in which thousands of Huguenots were killed in Paris and throughout France.|$|E
5|$|Friday {{made his}} debut for Walthamstow on 27 March 1971, against Bromley, {{coming off the}} bench to set up Walthamstow's equaliser. His first goal came on 17 April, when playing against Tooting & Mitcham he once again {{appeared}} as a substitute and scored a header late in the game. He joined west London club Hayes in December 1971 after scoring twice <b>against</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> an Isthmian League match. Hayes offered £30 per week, and were also based closer {{to his home in}} Acton. A near-fatal accident at work in July 1972 caused Friday to undergo extensive surgery; while working on a roof in Lambeth, a hoist rope became stuck on the scaffold he was working on. The Hayes forward attempted to free the rope but fell and landed on a large spike: the spike went up through one of his buttocks, through his stomach and narrowly avoided a lung. Not only was Friday strong enough to pull himself off the spike, he recovered from his injuries within three months and returned to the Hayes team in October 1972.|$|E

5|$|General Robert C. Oaks, USAF, Commander of United States Air Forces in Europe, {{immediately}} appointed an Air Force Regulation (AFR) 110-14 {{accident investigation}} board composed of a board president, 11 board members from the USAF and U.S. Army, three associate members from France, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, four legal advisers, and 13 technical advisers. The board president was Major General James G. Andrus, USAF. An AFR 110-14 investigation's findings are publicly released and the testimony of witnesses in the investigation can be used <b>against</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> military disciplinary proceedings. For this reason, after serious mishaps the USAF usually also conducts a separate safety investigation, in which the results are not publicly released and witness testimony is immune from prosecution. In this case, however, for unknown reasons the USAF decided not to conduct a safety investigation.|$|E
5|$|Having {{played for}} three {{counties}} as a child, Stansfield {{began his career}} in non-league with Cullompton Rangers and Elmore, and had unsuccessful trials at league teams. At the age of 23, he signed his first professional contract with Yeovil Town, after impressing their manager Gary Johnson in a match <b>against</b> <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> his first season, he helped them win the FA Trophy, scoring in the 2002 final. The following season, Yeovil won the Conference and promotion into The Football League, although Stansfield was ruled out with a broken leg in the first game. In 2004, he transferred to Hereford United, where he won promotion to The Football League via the 2006 play-offs, and repeated the feat with Exeter City a year later. He also helped Exeter earn promotion into League One in 2008. At international level, Stansfield played five matches and scored one goal for England's national semi-professional team, winning the 2005 Four Nations Tournament.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, McCabe’s cricket came to {{high-level}} {{attention for}} the first time.

Then state and future Australian selector Chappie Dwyer, who led a team of Sydney Grade Cricketers {{to play in the}} country town. The McCabe brothers defeated them, Stan scoring 19. Later, the Test leg spinner Arthur Mailey led a team that also included Test player Tommy Andrews to Grenfell, and McCabe scored 62, 35 and 62 not out in three innings <b>against</b> <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> the 192728 season, McCabe played for the Southern Districts against other regional sides within the state. He made 92 not out in one match, but failed to pass 12 in six other innings. Dwyer returned in 192728 and McCabe scored 70 against his team. Dwyer convinced McCabe's parents to allow their son to move to Sydney to further his cricket career.|$|E

5|$|In Congress, the {{influential}} senator and losing presidential candidate Rui Barbosa championed the rebels' cause. Barbosa used the navy official's rhetoric <b>against</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> arguing for a diplomatic solution, noting {{that if the}} new dreadnoughts were as unsinkable as they claimed, the remaining warships in government hands would certainly {{not be able to}} force a military victory. Furthermore, he argued, if such an attack had the support of Congress and failed, any resulting destruction of Rio de Janeiro would be held at fault. These arguments won Barbosa much support in the Senate, {{so much so that the}} body began working on an amnesty that would absolve the mutineers of all criminal charges once the ships were turned back over to the government. After hours of debate, the bill was passed unanimously that day and sent to the lower Chamber of Deputies on 25 November.|$|E
5|$|Prompt Payment and Stealing a Ride are two 1911 American silent short comedy films {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Prompt Payment focuses on a lawyer who evades his creditors, dons a disguise and plays <b>against</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> a game of poker. After winning a large sum of money from them, he excuses himself and returns to pay them with their own money. Stealing a Ride is listed as a comedy, but has a clear dramatic element. Susie and Johnnie are out sledding when Susie's parents are about {{to go out for}} a sleigh drive. The children ask to come along, but are refused. The children hitch their sleds {{to the back of the}} sleigh and follow along, only to fall off and get lost in the woods. The parents later track them down and bring them home. Both films were released together on a single reel on January 27, 1911 and were met with praise by critics. Both films are presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Scotland have conceded seven hat-tricks in total, {{with the}} first one scored on 2 April 1955 by Dennis Wilshaw in a 1955 British Home Championship match against England.

Nico Claesen of Belgium was the first player from outside the Home Nations to score a hat-trick against Scotland, in the UEFA Euro 1988 qualifying match on 1 April 1987. Scotland had only conceded four hat-tricks until the 200304 season when hat-tricks were scored <b>against</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> two successive matches, first by Ruud van Nistelrooy in a UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying playoff match against the Netherlands, and then by Robert Earnshaw in a friendly against Wales.|$|E

A judge had issued an injunction against further publication or {{sales of the}} book in 2009, but the Lisbon Court of Appeal overturned the ban in 2010, stating that it violated Amaral's freedom of expression. The ban was reinstated in 2015 {{as part of the}} libel ruling, then lifted when Amaral's appeal succeeded in 2016.
