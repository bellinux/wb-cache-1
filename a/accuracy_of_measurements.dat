40|$|Many animal vocalizations are non-periodic, frequency-modulated signals.

50|$|The <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> {{made using}} this bridge are {{dependent}} {{on a number of}} factors. The accuracy of the standard resistor (Rs) is of prime importance. Also of importance is how close the ratio of R1 to R2 is to the ratio of R&prime;1 to R&prime;2. As shown above, if the ratio is exactly the same, the error caused by the parasitic resistance (Rpar) is completely eliminated. In a practical bridge, the aim is to make this ratio as close as possible, but {{it is not possible to}} make it exactly the same. If the difference in ratio is small enough, then the last term of the balance equation above becomes small enough that it is negligible. Measurement accuracy is also increased by setting the current flowing through Rs and Rx to be as large as the rating of those resistors allows. This gives the greatest potential difference between the innermost potential connections (R2 and R&prime;2) to those resistors and consequently sufficient voltage for the change in R&prime;1 and R&prime;2 to have its greatest effect.|$|E
