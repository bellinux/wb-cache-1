5|$|A {{combination}} of 14 longitudinal stringers and four main longerons {{attached to the}} frames helped form a light but rigid structure to which sheets of <b>alclad</b> stressed skinning were attached. The fuselage plating was 24, 20 and 18 gauge in order of thickness towards the tail, while the fin structure was completed using short longerons from frames 20 to 23, before being covered in 22 gauge plating.|$|E
25|$|The ST {{featured}} two open cockpits {{in tandem}} {{in a metal}} semi-monocoque fuselage of two main frames – one steel, {{the other half of}} steel and half of aluminium alloy (<b>alclad)</b> – to take the loads from the wing spars and six more <b>alclad</b> frames; and <b>alclad</b> skin. It had wings in three sections of hybrid construction; the center section integral with the fuselage had tubular steel spars, the front spar a simple tube with an external brace to the upper fuselage, and the rear spar {{in the form of a}} parallel chord truss. The two outer wing panels had wooden spars and <b>alclad</b> ribs, with diagonal rods bracing the wings internally. <b>Alclad</b> sheet was used to form the leading edges, and fabric covered the whole structure. When attached, the outer wings were braced with flying wires to the fixed conventional landing gear and landing wires to the upper fuselage.|$|E
25|$|The PT-22's {{fuselage}} is {{a simple}} monocoque structure, with thick gauge <b>alclad</b> skin. The wings feature spruce spars, aluminum alloy ribs, steel compression members, with aircraft fabric covering aft to the trailing edge and aluminum alloy sheet covering from the leading edge to the spar. The wings have 4° 10' of sweep back, 3° of incidence and 4° 30' dihedral.|$|E
50|$|Pure {{aluminium}} naturally forms a thin {{surface layer}} of aluminium oxide on contact with {{oxygen in the}} atmosphere through a process called oxidation, which creates a physical barrier to corrosion or further oxidation in most environments. Aluminium alloys, however, offer little protection against corrosion. There are three main ways to passivate these alloys: <b>alclading,</b> chromate conversion coating and anodizing. <b>Alclading</b> {{is the process of}} metallurgically bonding a thin layer of pure aluminium to the aluminium alloy. Chromate conversion coating is a common way of passivating not only aluminum, but also zinc, cadmium, copper, silver, magnesium, and tin alloys. Anodizing forms a thick oxide coating. This finish is more robust than the other processes and also provides good electrical insulation, which the other two processes do not.|$|R
25|$|The Sarafand was a six-engined biplane {{flying boat}} with equal span wings. Due {{to the high}} wing end loads, Gouge {{specified}} corrugated steel spars for both upper and lower wings. The six engines, in tractor/pusher pairs, were housed in monocoque nacelles mounted between the wings on integral girders; the central nacelle was further supported by two pairs of splayed struts to the lower wing-roots. The hull, largely constructed of anodised <b>Alclad,</b> had a stainless-steel planing bottom. It had a monoplane tail unit with one large fin and two small auxiliary fins on the tailplane.|$|E
25|$|Bristol's design, the Type 130, was a high-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane of all-metal construction. Bristol's last monoplane design, the 1927 Bagshot, {{had suffered}} {{from lack of}} torsional rigidity in the wings leading to aileron reversal. This led to an extensive research program at Bristol {{which resulted in a}} wing design with a stressed metal skin rivetted to an internal framework consisting of multiple spars and the ribs. This was the basis of the Bombay's wing, which had seven spars, with high-tensile steel flanges and <b>alclad</b> webs. The aircraft had a twin-tail and a fixed tailwheel undercarriage.|$|E
25|$|The rudder {{mass balance}} {{was larger than}} that of {{production}} aircraft, with an angled lower edge cutting further {{into the top of}} the fin. Although the basic wing plan was to stay the same for most production Spitfires, the prototype wing was structurally different: No weapons were fitted and the <b>alclad</b> skinning was laid out in spanwise strips; underneath the port wing the radiator bath started immediately behind the starboard undercarriage bay, with the opening conforming to the angle of the bay. Unlike production aircraft the wingtips were {{an integral part of the}} structure and, for the first series of tests a long pitot tube projected from near the port wingtip.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} comprised three sections, {{with the}} main frames being riveted with the skin and the intermediate sections being riveted to the inside flanges of the longitudinal stringers. Extensive use of <b>Alclad</b> sheeting was made. Fuel was carried within total of three tanks, a pair of 182 gallon tanks contained within each wing and one 15 gallon tank within {{the roof of the}} fuselage; a further two auxiliary fuel tanks could be installed in the front fuselage bomb bay compartment. To ease production, an deliberate effort was made to reduce component count and standardise parts wherever possible. In combat, the fuselage proved to be capable of maintaining integrity despite multiple instances of severe damage being sustained.|$|E
2500|$|The wing was {{a fabric}} covered {{semi-cantilever}} braced with steel tube struts, and had solid spruce spars and stamped <b>Alclad</b> ribs with <b>Alclad</b> sheet wrapped over leading edge. A fuel tank is mounted within each wing near the root. Rudder and elevators were welded chrome-moly steel tubing. 116" [...] track undercarriage is fitted with oleo-pneumatic shock obsorbers and Bendix brakes, and is braced {{to the front}} struts and lower longerons.|$|E
2500|$|Ford's most {{successful}} aircraft was the Ford 4AT Trimotor, {{often called the}} [...] "Tin Goose" [...] because of its corrugated metal construction. It used a new alloy called <b>Alclad</b> that combined the corrosion resistance of aluminum with the strength of duralumin. The plane was similar to Fokker's V.VII-3m, and some say that Ford's engineers surreptitiously measured the Fokker plane and then copied it. The Trimotor first flew on June 11, 1926, {{and was the first}} successful U.S. passenger airliner, accommodating about 12 passengers in a rather uncomfortable fashion. Several variants were also used by the U.S. Army. Ford has been honored by the Smithsonian Institution for changing the aviation industry. 199 Trimotors were built before it was discontinued in 1933, when the Ford Airplane Division shut down because of poor sales during the Great Depression.|$|E
2500|$|Two Type 322s, {{which got}} the {{nickname}} [...] "Dumbo", were built. [...] Originally due for completion in early 1941, {{the project was}} delayed owing to the high priority then in force {{for the production of}} Spitfires. The first prototype (R1810) flew on 6 February 1943, followed by the second prototype (R1815) with the Merlin 32 in place of the Merlin 30, a four-blade rotol constant speed airscrew, a tail of greater area and <b>alclad</b> covered outer wings. [...] By this time, however, Fairey's competing design had entered service as the Fairey Barracuda, and the two Type 322s were used as experimental aircraft. A developed version was planned as the Supermarine type 380. [...] It was also intended that this wing technology was to the incorporated in a replacement for the Sea Otter – variable incidence benefiting seaplanes where the optimum angle of the floats can be maintained during takeoff and landing.|$|E
2500|$|The Curlew was an {{all-metal}} aeroplane, {{apart from}} the fabric covering of its elliptical, cantilever wing, and so an unusual light plane for its time. [...] The wing carried short span Frise ailerons outboard. [...] The rest of the trailing edge carried manually operated split flaps. The fuselage was a monocoque structure, built on duralumin ovals and stringers, covered with stress bearing <b>Alclad</b> sheet. [...] The engine installation was particularly neat for a radial. [...] The 7-cylinder 26.5 in (673mm) diameter 90hp (67kW) Pobjoy Niagara came as a [...] "power-egg" [...] complete with all accessories and its own long chord cowling, plus Pobjoy's characteristic [...] "smiley" [...] front baffle. [...] The similarity to inline installations was enhanced by the upward off-set of the drive shaft of the two-bladed propeller, caused by the gearbox. [...] The two generous open cockpits were in tandem, the front one at mid wing and the other at the trailing edge. The empennage was conventional: a slender fin carried a rounded, unbalanced rudder which extended down {{the bottom of the}} fuselage, and the tapered, mid-fuselage tailplane carried separate elevators so the rudder could move between them. [...] The undercarriage had vertical (in flying position) legs from the wings with a large (3 in or 76mm) movement, each sloping outwards slightly to increase the track and braced inwards by struts from halfway down the legs to the wing roots.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alclad</b> is a {{corrosion-resistant}} {{aluminium sheet}} formed from high-purity aluminium surface layers metallurgically bonded to {{high-strength aluminium alloy}} core material. These sheets are commonly used by the aircraft industry. The first aircraft to be constructed from <b>Alclad</b> was the all-metal US Navy airship ZMC-2, constructed in 1927 at Naval Air Station Grosse Ile. <b>Alclad</b> is a trademark of Alcoa but the term is also used generically.|$|E
50|$|The ST {{featured}} two open cockpits {{in tandem}} {{in a metal}} semi-monocoque fuselage of two main frames - one steel, {{the other half of}} steel and half of aluminium alloy (<b>alclad)</b> - to take the loads from the wing spars and six more <b>alclad</b> frames; and <b>alclad</b> skin.

50|$|The ZMC-2 was {{constructed}} out of <b>Alclad,</b> corrosion resistant aluminium sheet formed from high-purity aluminium surface layers metallurgically bonded to high strength aluminium alloy core material. The result {{was about as}} strong as carbon or mild steel. The downside was that <b>Alclad</b> was thicker than sheet aluminum, making the ship several hundred pounds heavier than originally envisioned. The aircraft was already under construction, and over 20 feet of the nose completed using duraluminum when {{the decision was made}} to switch to <b>Alclad.</b> The reason for the switch was that duraluminum is highly susceptible to corrosion, particularly in a salt water environment, the exact sort of environment a Navy blimp operates in. The ZMC-2 was the first aircraft constructed from <b>Alclad</b> in the US, and no previous experience could be drawn upon for its handling.|$|E

50|$|The welds on alloys 52-½H, 53ST, or <b>Alclad</b> 24ST were anodically {{protected}} in the tidewater tests but were corroded {{in the weather}} tests. Gas welds were the least attacked, spot welds next, and seam welds the most attacked. Welds on 53ST alloy were more prone to attack than on the other two. The aluminum coating on the <b>Alclad</b> 24ST welds was sacrificially attacked and thus prevented deep penetration of corrosion.|$|E
5000|$|Described in NACA-TN-259, of August 1927, as [...] "a new {{corrosion}} resistant aluminum product which is markedly {{superior to the}} present strong alloys. Its use should result in greatly increased life of a structural part. <b>Alclad</b> is a heat-treated aluminum, copper, manganese, magnesium alloy that has the corrosion resistance of pure metal at the surface {{and the strength of}} the strong alloy underneath. Of particular importance is the thorough character of the union between the alloy and the pure aluminum. Preliminary results of salt spray tests (24 weeks of exposure) show changes in tensile strength and elongation of <b>Alclad</b> 17ST, when any occurred, to be so small as to be well within the limits of experimental error." [...] In applications involving aircraft construction, <b>Alclad</b> has proven to have increased resistance to corrosion at the expense of increased weight when compared to sheet aluminum.|$|E
5000|$|... 2024 is {{commonly}} extruded, and {{also available in}} <b>alclad</b> sheet and plate forms. It is not commonly forged (the related 2014 aluminium alloy is, though).|$|E
50|$|Alloys 52S-½H, 53ST, and <b>Alclad</b> 24ST were {{slightly}} corroded when {{in contact with}} each other but all wee anodic to alloy 24ST and were attacked when in contact with 24ST.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was built}} up as a Pratt truss frame formed mainly from Duraluminum tubing and fittings with welded Chrome-moly tubing reinforcing highly stressed areas {{and covered in}} fabric.The wing was a fabric covered semi-cantilever braced with steel tube struts, and had solid spruce spars and stamped <b>Alclad</b> ribs with <b>Alclad</b> sheet wrapped over leading edge. A fuel tank is mounted within each wing near the root.

50|$|Skin {{sheet on}} light {{airplanes}} of recent {{design and construction}} generally is <b>alclad</b> 2024-T3. The internal structure comprises stringers, spars, bulkheads, chord members, and various attaching fittings made of aluminum extrusions, formed sheet, forgings, and castings.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of the aircraft was <b>Alclad</b> aluminium alloy. The wing was designed in sections, so that alternative engines (Taurus) or armament could be accommodated. Fowler flaps were fitted for take-off/landing. Spoiler flaps were fitted to improve performance.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{addition}} of copper improves strength, it also makes these alloys susceptible to corrosion. For sheet products, corrosion resistance can be greatly enhanced by metallurgical bonding of a high-purity aluminium surface layer. These sheets {{are referred to as}} <b>alclad,</b> and are commonly used by the aircraft industry.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{high-performance}} aircraft designed since 1945 {{have made}} {{extensive use of}} skin structures machined from thick plate and extrusions, precluding the use of <b>alclad</b> exterior skins. Maintenance requirements increased as a result, and these stimulated research and development programs seeking higher-strength alloys with improved resistance to corrosion without cladding.|$|E
50|$|Anodized 17ST rivets proved {{far better}} than 53ST or {{anodized}} A17ST rivets for joining aluminum alloy 24ST. All three were satisfactory for joining aluminum alloys 52S-½H, 53ST, or <b>Alclad</b> 24ST, but the 53ST rivet heads on these alloys, in the weather-exposure tests only, were somewhat more corroded and exhibited intercrystalline attack.|$|E
50|$|Alloys <b>Alclad</b> 24ST and 52S-½H {{proved the}} most {{resistant}} to corrosion of the aluminum alloys tested and were but slightly attacked during 2 years. Alloys 53ST and anodized 24ST were somewhat more susceptible to attack, while the alloys containing copper, such as 24ST, 14ST, and Major metal were much more susceptible.|$|E
50|$|The Knuckleduster's straight-sided hull was of {{all-metal}} (<b>Alclad)</b> box-section construction, {{from the}} bow {{as far as}} the pointed main step {{at the rear of the}} planing bottom; aft of the main step the fuselage was of monocoque construction. The central section of the hull was boxed and braced by diagonal frames to bear the loads from the wing-root attachments.|$|E
50|$|Alloy 52S-½H was {{the least}} {{attacked}} of the aluminum alloys {{when they were in}} contact with dissimilar metals. Alloy 53ST was usually considerably more corroded, while attack on 24ST and <b>Alclad</b> 24ST alloys was severe. This result does not necessarily reflect the true potential relationships involved, owing principally to inherent differences in the resistance of the various aluminum alloys to corrosion.|$|E
50|$|The PT-22's {{fuselage}} is {{a simple}} monocoque structure, with thick gauge <b>alclad</b> skin. The wings feature spruce spars, aluminum alloy ribs, steel compression members, with aircraft fabric covering aft to the trailing edge and aluminum alloy sheet covering from the leading edge to the spar.

5000|$|... {{construction}} of aircraft structures, such as wings and fuselages, more commonly in homebuilt aircraft than commercial or military aircraft. 2024 alloy is somewhat stronger, but 6061 is more easily worked and remains resistant to corrosion {{even when the}} surface is abraded, {{which is not the}} case for 2024, which is usually used with a thin <b>Alclad</b> coating for corrosion resistance.|$|E
5000|$|The ZMC-2 was {{nicknamed the}} [...] "Tin Bubble" [...] {{and was also}} {{sometimes}} called a [...] "tinship". The skin was not tin but <b>Alclad.</b> The airship was roughly teardrop shaped and had eight small stabilizer fins, four of which had rudders. It was held together with over 3.5 million rivets, which were applied by an innovative sewing machine-like device which produced airtight seams.|$|E
50|$|Electrodeposited {{coatings}} of cadmium on SAE X4130 steel strips {{attached to}} aluminum-alloy panels were in excellent condition and intact after 2 years of weather exposure. Electrodeposited zinc coatings {{on the same}} steel were mostly corroded off when joined to <b>Alclad</b> 24ST and 53ST sheets. When joined to 52S-½H and 24ST sheets, the zinc was attacked but was not corroded off to the same extent.|$|E
50|$|A {{combination}} of 14 longitudinal stringers and four main longerons {{attached to the}} frames helped form a light but rigid structure to which sheets of <b>alclad</b> stressed skinning were attached. The fuselage plating was 24, 20 and 18 gauge in order of thickness towards the tail, while the fin structure was completed using short longerons from frames 20 to 23, before being covered in 22 gauge plating.|$|E
50|$|The {{magnesium}} alloys {{were very}} anodic to aluminum alloys, or to stainless steel. The adjacent aluminum alloys, especially 24ST and <b>Alclad</b> 24ST, were in turn severely corroded by a base produced during {{the formation of}} the resulting corrosion product, which was a basic magnesium carbonate. Dowmetal M proved anodic to Dowmetal H alloy. Painted panels exposed for 2 years to the weather were but slightly corroded.|$|E
50|$|Corrosion {{products}} that accumulated at the faying {{surfaces of the}} dissimilar metals raised the stresses in some instances enough, with the combined corrosive action, to cause cracks to form in the strips.
