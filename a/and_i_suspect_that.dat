5|$|Being unemployed, {{we spent}} {{almost all of}} each weekday at the school, so if a tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum of money. That, of course, was not her way of doing things. She {{required}} no payment for the training she provided, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> she was quite out of pocket over the whole affair... It would be true {{to say that a}} great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E
500|$|Donald Zec in the Daily Mirror {{was equally}} damning of Lazenby's acting abilities, {{comparing}} him unfavourably to Connery: [...] "He looks uncomfortably {{in the part}} like a size four foot in a size ten gumboot." [...] Zec was kinder to Lazenby's co-star, saying that [...] "there is style to Diana Rigg's performance <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> the last scene which draws something of a performance out of Lazenby owes much to her silken expertise." [...] The New York Times critic AH Weiler also weighed in against Lazenby, saying that [...] "Lazenby, if not a spurious Bond, is merely a casual, pleasant, satisfactory replacement." ...|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} Laurent should have {{received}} the nomination at the 16th Screen Actors Guild Awards saying, [...] "In drawing attention to one performer, in particular, whom they {{left out of the}} Best Supporting Actress category, [...] I flat-out adore this performance <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> many others do too," [...] and further lauding Laurent's performance added, [...] " [...] is radiant and, in a unique Tarantino way, heartbreaking. Sexy and luminous in the heat of her valor. Putting out fire – and setting it. It becomes an anthem of noirish dread and excitement, a sign that Laurent, as Shosanna, has found her destiny." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I had a {{suspicion}} that you didn’t want to know. You’re a fastidious fellow, you know, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> you’d rather leave a mean job {{of that kind}} to me.” ...|$|R
60|$|That {{evening after}} dinner Tom came in alone, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> Perry had sent him. He was fidgety, ill at ease, and {{presently}} asked if I {{could see him}} a moment in my study. Maude's glance followed us.|$|R
6000|$|... “Well,” said Mrs. Ruck, “I’m glad you’ve {{had some}} company.” Her husband looked at her, in silence, through narrowed eyelids, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> her unusually gracious {{observation}} {{was prompted by}} the less innocent aftertaste of her own late pastime.|$|R
500|$|Many {{people in}} the {{community}} wrote of how much they enjoyed their experience and, in particular, the light-hearted atmosphere. One participant, a man named John Codman, joined the community at the age of 27 in 1843. He wrote, [...] "It was for the meanest a life above humdrum, and for the greatest something far, infinitely far beyond. They looked into the gates of life and saw beyond charming visions, and hopes springing up for all". The idealism of the community sometimes was not met, however. Because the community was officially secular, a variety of religions were represented, though not always amicably. When Isaac Hecker and, later, Sophia Ripley converted to Catholicism, a Protestant Brook Farmer complained, [...] "We are beginning to see wooden crosses around and pictures of saints... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> rosaries are rattling under aprons." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{the editor}} of Personal Computer World was on holiday in May 1981, his colleagues publicised the magazine's review of the ZX81 with a cover showing a {{chimpanzee}} with the machine above the strapline [...] "Editor benchtests the ZX81". (The chimp returned in later issues to [...] "benchtest" [...] all of Sinclair's subsequent computers.) The review, which was written by PCW staffer Dave Tebbutt, acknowledged that the machine had significant shortcomings but nonetheless represented [...] "absolutely amazing value for money". He described the ZX81 as [...] "a lovely product which will have enormous appeal to people wanting {{to find out more}} about computers, but without it costing them an arm and a leg" [...] and concluded: [...] "If you know nothing about computers and you want to enjoy finding out about them, then this machine offers a value for money way of doing just that. Children will love the ZX81, there can be no question about that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> more than a few people who are already familiar with computers will buy one, just to have a bit of fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It {{sounds a}} drastic rule. The {{trouble is that}} my {{relatives}} and friends expect too much of me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> {{some of them are}} pulling opposite ways.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mrs. Ruck, [...] "I'm glad you've {{had some}} company." [...] Her husband looked at her, in silence, through narrowed eyelids, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> this gracious {{observation}} on the lady's part {{was prompted by}} a restless conscience.|$|R
60|$|CHARLES. Rowley my old Friend--I am {{sure you}} congratulate me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> too <b>that</b> <b>I</b> owe you much.|$|R
2500|$|In 1999 Pyramid {{magazine}} named Button Men {{as one of}} the Millennium's Best Games. [...] Editor Scott Haring said [...] "This game {{just gets}} more and more impressive every time I look at it. ... the idea is so simple, and the strategy so subtle [...] [...] [...] I've never figured out exactly how to master this game, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that's</b> because there is no good way to do so." ...|$|R
60|$|The sun was rising, and {{the water}} assumed an {{opalescent}} hue. It was a delicious morning, Casanova tells us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> never had any morning seemed to that audacious, amiable rascal as delicious as this upon which he regained his liberty, which no man ever valued more highly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I seldom give {{my opinion}} on these matters," [...] Broadwood {{answered}} with a laugh. [...] "On the whole, I think Effie's right; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> knowing the thing won't please the others gives it a charm. After all, she hasn't much reason for respecting their prejudices. At first, they nearly drove us out of Allenwood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must all}} agree, sir, that there's not much {{danger of the}} object you mention being realized. No doubt, there are some to whom this doesn't matter, but the rest are confronted with the {{necessity}} for making a living, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> one or two have the trouble I've experienced in paying my storekeepers' bills." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{happened}} then {{to cross the}} street, and the traffic prevented us from speaking. What Colonel MacAndrew had told me seemed very improbable, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> Mrs. Strickland, for reasons of her own, had concealed from him {{some part of the}} facts. It was clear that a man after seventeen years of wedlock did not leave his wife without certain occurrences which must have led her to <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> all was not well with their married life. The Colonel caught me up.|$|R
6000|$|So much of ----.[6] All that <b>I</b> know, <b>and</b> all <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> {{is to be}} known. A kind, gentlemanly, affectionate hearted man, {{possessed of}} an {{absolute}} talent for industry. Would to God, {{he had never heard}} of Philosophy! ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{all these}} questions, <b>and</b> especially, <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> <b>that</b> last one, ought {{to lead the}} young student up to the great and complex question--How were these islands re-peopled with plants and animals, after the long and {{wholesale}} catastrophe of the glacial epoch? ...|$|R
6000|$|While he was {{speaking}} Queen Cor had been studying the boy's face stealthily, {{from the corners of}} her eyes, and she said to herself: [...] "He is so small and innocent that I believe I can capture him alone, and with ease. He does not seem very terrible <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> King Gos and his warriors were frightened at nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't want control, but I {{may have}} to take it," [...] Harding answered. [...] "The {{settlement}} will fall to bits if it's left alone, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> I'm the only man who can hold it up. I'm glad you have talked to me. What you've said {{makes it clear that}} I've not time to lose. Now, however, this hay must be cut." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Upton laughed aloud. [...] "I wouldn't {{dare say}} no {{in the face}} of such {{completely}} organized plans," [...] he confessed. [...] "Of course he may go. It's a splendid idea, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> when he comes back for the next term of the school year he will be feeling so fine that nothing can stop him from winning that scholarship he has set his heart on, and has been working so hard for." ...|$|E
60|$|I lost my poem somewhere {{about the}} house, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> soon <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> my uncle had found it; as he harshly intimated {{to me that}} I could return home, <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> need not come and see him again until he should send for me.|$|R
60|$|Madame shot at me the swiftest of glances <b>and</b> laughed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> she divined Nick's {{propensity}} for adventure. However, {{she said nothing}} more than to bid me sit down at the table, and presently Zoey came in with lights and strange, highly seasoned dishes, which I ate with avidity, notwithstanding my uneasiness of mind, watching the while the party {{at the far end of}} the room. There were five young gentlemen playing a game I knew not, with intervals of intense silence, and boisterous laughter and execrations while the cards were being shuffled and the money rang on the board and glasses were being filled from a stand at one side. Presently Madame Bouvet returned, and placing before me a cup of wondrous coffee, advanced down the room towards them.|$|R
5000|$|Fred Schneider {{called the}} project [...] "a haunting, evocative wall-of-sound {{experience}} that is affecting in an incredibly visceral way". Neil Gaiman commented, [...] "I wish every school taught music like this. I wish every piece of music recorded in a school gymnasium were this haunting... <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that,</b> if <b>I</b> listened to them right, maybe they would be." ...|$|R
60|$|People do {{not always}} {{formulate}} the beliefs on which they act. The instinct of fear and dislike is quicker than the reasoning process; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that,</b> taken in conjunction with some other causes, such instinctive aversion {{is at the bottom}} of the long exclusion of any serious discipline in the physical sciences from the general curriculum of Universities; while, on the other hand, classical literature has been gradually made the backbone of the Arts course.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here," [...] said Uncle John, musingly, [...] "is a {{philosophy}} I {{did not expect}} from you, Von Taer. They tell me you're one who stands on top the peak. And you were born that way, and didn't have to climb. Seems to me you rather scorn the crowd that's trying to climb to an eminence you never had to win. That wouldn't be my way. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> if the crowd wasn't trying to climb to you, your own position wouldn't be worth a cotton hat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{doubt if}} it would help you to tell it. I've too much respect for your good sense to suppose that it's an unreality; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> {{confession}} would only weaken you. If you told me, you would feel that you had made me a partner in your responsibility, and you would be tempted to leave the struggle to me. If you're battling with some temptation, some self-betrayal, you must make the fight alone: you would only turn to an ally to be flattered into disbelief of your danger or your culpability." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{are there}} any men in this kingdom, except such as find their account in public confusion, who would hazard the {{introduction}} of such scenes of rapine, barbarity, and bloodshed, as have disgraced France and outraged humanity, {{for the sake of}} obtaining--what?--Liberty <b>and</b> Equality. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> the meaning of these terms is not clearly and generally understood: it may be of use to explain them.|$|R
5000|$|... "There {{have been}} {{proposals}} to 'improve' design by converting {{into a kind}} of science. Those with even a smattering of recent history will remember that the same attempts were made in psychology <b>and</b> sociology. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> such efforts are not so much an attempt to improve, but rather to get a free ride on the enormous prestige science enjoys. Design is not science and it never will be." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Reese {{is still}} the best, and in my opinion by a greater margin than before. His dummy and defence are as immaculate as ever, and the old gentleman has {{actually}} polished up his bidding. Believe it or not, he has condescended to play 'fourth suit forcing' <b>and</b> Stayman, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> strongly <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> by 1973 he will be giving the Baron system a close look." ...|$|R
60|$|I confess {{it was a}} {{wonderful}} performance--quite as neat as Colman could have made it; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> Harold did not refrain from producing needle and thread from his fat miscellaneous pocket-book, and repairing her many disasters before they reached the domestic eye; for there was a chronic feud between Dora and Colman, and the attempts of the latter to make the child more like a young lady were passionately repelled, though she would better endure those of a rough little under-housemaid, whose civilisation was, I suppose, not quite so far removed from her own.|$|E
6000|$|Enough of the Gasse. The {{weather is}} here much colder. It rained {{a good deal}} yesterday; and though it is fair and sunshiny again to- day, and we can still sit, of course, with our windows open, {{yet there is no}} more excuse for the siesta; and the bathe in the river, except for cleanliness, is no longer a {{necessity}} of life. The Main is very swift. In one part of the baths it is next door to impossible to swim against it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that,</b> out in the open, it would be quite impossible. - Adieu, my dear mother, and believe me, ever your affectionate son, ...|$|E
60|$|No {{doubt there}} were once finer {{dwellings}} than the peasants' houses {{which are now}} the only habitations on the Lido; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> a genteel villa must formerly have stood near the farm-gate, which we found surmounted by broken statues of Venus and Diana. The poor goddesses were both headless, and some cruel fortune had struck off their hands, and they looked strangely forlorn in the swaggering attitudes of the absurd period of art to which they belonged: they extended their mutilated arms toward the sea for pity, but it regarded them not; and we passed before them scoffing at their bad taste, for we were hungry, and it was yet some distance to Malamocco.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never liked}} him," [...] said Julius. [...] "I felt {{from the first}} that there was {{something}} wrong about him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> always <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> it was he who silenced Mrs. Vandemeyer so appositely. But it wasn't till I heard that the order for Tommy's execution came right on the heels of our interview with him that Sunday that I began to tumble {{to the fact that he}} was the big bug himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] he said, [...] "that {{there can}} be no doubt about that. I saw the Chinaman whom Laura is so fond of sneaking away from this tent a few minutes ago, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> some devilry. <b>That</b> is why <b>I</b> went <b>and</b> fetched my revolver." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should {{agree with}} you but {{for one or two}} remarks that fell from him. They showed an insight into the real nature of {{scientific}} knowledge, and an instinctive sense of the truths underlying words, which I have never met with except in men of considerable culture <b>and</b> experience. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> his manner is deliberately assumed in protest against the selfish vanity which is the common source of social polish. It is partly natural, no doubt. He seems too impatient to choose his words heedfully. Do you ever go to the theatre?" ...|$|R
