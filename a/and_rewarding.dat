5|$|Mephedrone {{is often}} {{consumed}} with alcohol. A study in mice investigated the interrelation {{between these two}} substances, focusing on the psychostimulant <b>and</b> <b>rewarding</b> properties of mephedrone. It found that at low (non stimulant) doses alcohol significantly enhanced the psychostimulant effects of mephedrone. This effect was mediated {{by an increase in}} synaptic dopamine, as haloperidol, but not ketanserin, was able to block the potentiation by alcohol. Similarly, the rewarding properties of mephedrone were enhanced by a low non-rewarding dose of alcohol.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of his father in 1853 Markham needed paid employment, and in December 1853 secured a junior clerkship in the Legacy Duty Office of the Inland Revenue at a salary of £90 per annum (around £6,000 in 2008). He found the work tedious, but after six months was able to {{transfer}} to the forerunner of what became, in 1857, the India Office. Here, the work was interesting <b>and</b> <b>rewarding,</b> with sufficient time to allow him to travel and pursue his geographical interests.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long {{abolished}} all large landholding by princes, nobles {{and high}} officials. He dismantled the 800-year-old practice of paying officials <b>and</b> <b>rewarding</b> or endowing nobles with {{a portion of}} the taxes from a village or a group thereof. Existing highways were repaired and new ones constructed, with the north-south road from Saigon to Lạng Sơn put under restoration. He organised a postal service to operate along the highways and public storehouses were built to alleviate starvation in drought-affected years. Gia Long enacted monetary reform and implemented a more socialized agrarian policy. However, the population growth far outstripped that of land clearing and cultivation. There was little emphasis on innovation in agricultural technology, so the improvements in productivity were mainly derived from increasing the amount of cultivated farmland.|$|E

40|$|The study, {{financial}} incentives <b>and</b> <b>rewards</b> on employee motivation in the Nigerian electricity distribution company, used likert scale form questionnaire {{to gather data}} from purposive selected employees of the company. On one hand, {{respondents were asked to}} rank six financial and non-{{financial incentives}} <b>and</b> <b>rewards</b> in order of importance. The result revealed that financial incentives <b>and</b> <b>rewards</b> were more important and motivating to the respondents. On the other hand, Chi-Square crossstabulation on the hypotheses revealed that financial incentives <b>and</b> <b>rewards</b> influence employee attitude, job satisfaction and productivity irrespective of gender and cadre in the organisation.

40|$|Although {{theoretical}} {{discourse and}} experimental {{studies on the}} self <b>and</b> <b>reward</b> biases have a long tradition, currently we have only a limited {{understanding of how the}} biases are represented in the brain and, more importantly, how they relate to each other. We used multi-voxel pattern analysis to test for common representations of self <b>and</b> <b>reward</b> in perceptual matching in healthy human subjects. Voxels across an anterior-posterior axis in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) distinguished (i) self-others <b>and</b> (ii) high-low <b>reward,</b> but cross generalization between these dimensions decreased from anterior to posterior vmPFC. The vmPFC is characterized by a shift from a common currency for value to independent, distributed representations of self <b>and</b> <b>reward</b> across an anterior-posterior axis. This shift reflected changes in functional connectivity between the posterior part of the vmPFC and the frontal pole when processing self-associated stimuli, and the middle frontal gyrus when processing stimuli associated with high reward. The changes in functional connectivity were correlated with behavioral biases respectively to the self <b>and</b> <b>reward.</b> The distinct representations of self <b>and</b> <b>reward</b> in the posterior vmPFC are associated with self <b>and</b> <b>reward</b> biases in behavior...|$|R
5|$|Harmon {{thought that}} Far Cry 4 was an {{improvement}} over Far Cry 3, but {{he thought that the}} game felt and played too similarly to Far Cry 3, and he added that the game was unambitious. Bertz thought that Ubisoft Montreal's vision for Far Cry 4 is not as bold as its predecessors, and also thought that the experience delivered by Far Cry 4 did not stray far away from Far Cry 3. Tan also noted that the game's open world design felt not only similar to Far Cry 3, but also other Ubisoft franchises like Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs. Evans-Thirlwell thought that the experience offered by Far Cry 4 was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel. Dyer thought that the game was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying <b>and</b> <b>rewarding.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} team {{designed the}} online multiplayer component {{to be balanced}} <b>and</b> <b>rewarding</b> for new players while still offering something for experienced players. An early idea to implement air support (air strikes and attack helicopters) involved players fighting over special zones to access a trigger for air support against enemies. This idea was discarded because it discouraged the type of deathmatch gameplay they intended. The kill streak reward system was put in its place to encourage the improvement of player skills. Players were allowed to select weapons before matches to get accustomed to weapons more easily and minimize weapon hunting. Maps were designed primarily for deathmatch games—the developers felt such designs suited other types of gameplay as well. Map layouts were designed to minimize locations players could hide from enemy gunfire.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the first}} of a series of papers that review the state of {{knowledge}} and practice regarding compensation <b>and</b> <b>rewards</b> for environmental services in the developing world. The paper begins with an assessment of the historical development of compensation <b>and</b> <b>reward</b> mechanisms within a broader context of changing approaches to nature conservation and environmental policy. The assessment shows that greater interest in compensation <b>and</b> <b>reward</b> mechanisms has emerged within a policy context of changing approaches to nature conservation and flexible multi-stakeholder approaches to environmental management. In the developing world, an even greater variety of perspectives has emerged on the opportunities and threats for using compensation <b>and</b> <b>rewards</b> for environmental services. Within that background, the paper clarifies key concepts - including the distinction between compensation <b>and</b> <b>reward</b> - <b>and</b> presents a conceptual framework for typifying and characterizing different types of mechanisms that link ecosystem stewards, ecosystem service beneficiaries, and intermediaries...|$|R

25|$|Music {{has been}} shown to {{consistently}} elicit emotional responses in its listeners, and this relationship between human affect and music has been studied in depth. This includes isolating which specific features of a musical work or performance convey or elicit certain reactions, the nature of the reactions themselves, and how characteristics of the listener may determine which emotions are felt. The field draws upon and has significant implications for such areas as philosophy, musicology, and aesthetics, as well the acts of musical composition and performance. The implications for casual listeners are also great; research has shown that the pleasurable feelings associated with emotional music are the result of dopamine release in the striatum—the same anatomical areas that underpin the anticipatory <b>and</b> <b>rewarding</b> aspects of drug addiction.|$|E

25|$|In Milan, Neoclassicism began a {{few years}} later than in its main European counterparts, mainly {{as a result of the}} {{problems}} of succession to the thone of the Austrian empire, with Maria Theresa's lengthy reign. Initially, Neoclassicism in Milan, like the artists who practiced it, was not so much inspired by the classical models of Ancient Rome or Roman Neoclassicism as by developments in London, Paris and Parma. It was a period of great public works covering theatres, libraries and schools, and more generally of important works for the public good, reflecting the ambitions of an enlightened government. It was a period in which the State and the government itself led the city's cultural life and progress, promoting and funding new activities <b>and</b> <b>rewarding</b> the most deserving citizens and achievements. During this initial period, Neoclassicism was characterized by a more sober and austere approach, resulting in symmetrical, well-ordered structures.|$|E
25|$|As {{a policy}} of {{controlling}} <b>and</b> <b>rewarding</b> his generals, Mari Djata adopted their sons. These children were raised at the mansas court and became Keitas upon reaching maturity. Seeing the throne as their right, two adopted sons of Mari Djata waged a devastating war against one another that threatened to destroy what the first two mansas had built. The first son to gain the throne was Mansa Ouati Keita (also spelt Wati) in 1270. He reigned for four years, spending lavishly and ruling cruelly, according to the djelis. Upon his death in 1274, the other adopted son seized the throne. Mansa Khalifa Keita is remembered as even worse than Ouati Keita. According to the djelis, he governed just as badly, was insane and fired arrows {{from the roof of}} his palace at passers by. Ibn Khaldun recounts that the people rushed upon him and killed him during a popular revolt. The Gbara replaced him with Manding Bory Keita in 1275.|$|E
25|$|Periods {{of rapid}} climate change {{generally}} saw {{a collapse of}} this mixed Mediterranean farming system; commercial production was replaced with subsistence agricultural foodstuffs; and transhumance pastoralism became a year-round nomadic pastoral activity, whilst tribal groups wandered in a circular pattern north to the Euphrates, or south to the Egyptian delta with their flocks. Occasionally, tribal chieftains would emerge, raiding enemy settlements <b>and</b> <b>rewarding</b> loyal followers from the spoils or by tariffs levied on merchants. Should the cities band together and retaliate, a neighbouring state intervene or should the chieftain suffer a reversal of fortune, allies would fall away or intertribal feuding would return. It {{has been suggested that}} the Patriarchal tales of the Bible reflect such social forms. During the periods of the collapse of Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia and the First Intermediate Period of Egypt, the Hyksos invasions {{and the end of the}} Middle Bronze Age in Assyria and Babylonia, and the Late Bronze Age collapse, trade through the Canaanite area would dwindle, as Egypt, Babylonia, and to a lesser degree Assyria, withdrew into their isolation. When the climates stabilized, trade would resume firstly along the coast in the area of the Philistine and Phoenician cities. As markets redeveloped, new trade routes that would avoid the heavy tariffs of the coast would develop from Kadesh Barnea, through Hebron, Lachish, Jerusalem, Bethel, Samaria, Shechem, Shiloh through Galilee to Jezreel, Hazor and Megiddo. Secondary Canaanite cities would develop in this region. Further economic development would see the creation of a third trade route from Eilath, Timna, Edom (Seir), Moab, Ammon and thence to the Aramean states of Damascus and Palmyra. Earlier states (for example the Philistines and Tyrians in the case of Judah and Samaria, for the second route, and Judah and Israel for the third route) tried generally unsuccessfully to control the interior trade.|$|E

Drawing on {{a representative sample}} of 211 multinational corporations, we examine the uptake and determinants of performance management <b>and</b> <b>reward</b> practices used by multinational corporations in Australia. We investigate the influence of established contextual and organisational factors on performance management <b>and</b> <b>rewards</b> <b>and</b> explore the use of such practices amongst managers relative to the largest occupational group. Our findings suggest that overall multinational corporations operating in Australia use a wide range of performance management <b>and</b> <b>reward</b> practices. Findings indicate that multinational corporations are higher users of such practices for managers relative to the largest occupational group. Logistic regression results demonstrate that multinational corporations with higher use of human resource-shared services and global human resource integration are more likely to use the measured performance management <b>and</b> <b>reward</b> practices for both the largest occupational group and managers, suggesting some level of global integration around human resource activities. There is also greater likelihood of the use of these practices where there is low union recognition for the purpose of collective bargaining for the largest occupational group.
