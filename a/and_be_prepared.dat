5|$|On September2, the National Hurricane Center issued gale {{warnings}} and hurricane watches for Guadeloupe, Desirade, Antigua and Barbuda. Later that day, the gale warnings were expanded southward to include islands north of Dominica. After Christine weakened to a tropical depression, the NHC discontinued all watches and warnings for the Leeward Islands. Schools were closed in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands as a precaution. Six scientists {{had to be}} evacuated from the small island of Aves once the storm posed a threat to them. On St. Thomas, nine emergency shelters were opened, mainly in schools. On September5, an emergency meeting was held by disaster officials in Puerto Rico about the threat of flooding from Christine. All residents were urged by government officials to have their disaster kits ready <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> to evacuate if told to do so. Firefighters, on and off-duty, were advised {{about the possibility of}} evacuations and would be pulled into work if needed.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church {{sees the}} sacrament of {{confirmation}} as required to complete the grace given in baptism. When adults are baptised, confirmation is normally given immediately afterwards, a practice followed even with newly baptised infants in the Eastern Catholic Churches. In the West confirmation of children is delayed until they {{are old enough to}} understand or at the bishop's discretion. In Western Christianity, particularly Catholicism, the sacrament is called confirmation, because it confirms and strengthens the grace of baptism; in the Eastern Churches, it is called chrismation, because the essential rite is the anointing of the person with chrism, a mixture of olive oil and some perfumed substance, usually balsam, blessed by a bishop. Those who receive confirmation must be in a state of grace, which for those who have reached the age of reason means that they should first be cleansed spiritually by {{the sacrament of}} Penance; they should also have the intention of receiving the sacrament, <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> to show in their lives that they are Christians.|$|E
25|$|Konoe {{made one}} more {{desperate attempt to}} avert war. He {{proposed}} a personal summit with Roosevelt–in the United States if necessary–to come to some understanding.

25|$|At 04:55 {{a single}} Viet Cong mortar round {{exploded}} {{to the front}} of the perimeter of the 1/26th Infantry. Haig heard and correctly interpreted it to be a registration round for a mortar attack. He immediately ordered all of his companies to be on full alert posture and directed them to take cover <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> for an attack. He also recommended that the 1/16th Infantry do the same, and Lazzell's unit complied.|$|E

McQueen saw this in Evans and felt that he could lift the standard of music at the school. This did indeed happen. For many years, P.L.C won the coveted 'Dempster Shield' for choral singing.

25|$|Plumer’s Second Army was (9 September) hived {{off from}} Haig's direct command into the Group d’Armees de Flandres (GAF), {{commanded}} notionally by King Albert of the Belgians {{but in reality}} by his chief of staff, the French General Degoutte. Haig had to agree but declined to loan three cavalry divisions as well. Dissatisfied by Plumer’s plan for a limited offensive to retake Messines, Haig urged him to retake the high ground around Ypres (the British objectives from the previous autumn) <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> to land a division on the coast at Ostend. Plumer was sceptical as late as 13 September.|$|E

25|$|On the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Chamberlain brought Churchill into government again in his old post of First Lord, so giving him direct responsibility {{for the conduct of}} naval operations. Churchill was required to defend the government of which he was a member, whatever his private views. He had pressed the Cabinet to ignore Norwegian neutrality, mine Norwegian territorial waters <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> to seize Narvik, in both cases to disrupt the export of Swedish iron ore to Germany during winter months, when the Baltic Sea was frozen. On behalf of the Admiralty, he had however advised that a major landing in Norway was not realistically within Germany's powers.|$|E
25|$|Robertson became Commander-in-Chief of the British Army of the Rhine in April 1919. It {{was at a}} tennis-party at {{his house}} in Cologne that the young Captain Montgomery persuaded him to add his name {{to the list of}} {{officers}} selected for Staff College, which would be his only hope of ever achieving high command. In late June 1919 it briefly appeared that Germany might refuse to sign the Versailles Treaty. Units – consisting largely of young and inexperienced soldiers as war veterans had been given priority for demobilisation – had to be concentrated to advance further into Germany <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> for irregular warfare, but the crisis passed.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 review found {{a number}} of adverse events were {{reported}} after acupuncture in the UK's National Health Service (NHS) but most (95%) were not severe, though miscategorization and under-reporting may alter the total figures. From January 2009 to December 2011, 468 safety incidents were recognized within the NHS organizations. The adverse events recorded included retained needles (31%), dizziness (30%), loss of consciousness/unresponsive (19%), falls (4%), bruising or soreness at needle site (2%), pneumothorax (1%) and other adverse side effects (12%). Acupuncture practitioners should know, <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> to be responsible for, any substantial harm from treatments. Some acupuncture proponents argue that {{the long history of}} acupuncture suggests it is safe. However, there is an increasing literature on adverse events (e.g. spinal-cord injury).|$|E

25|$|The {{central column}} would {{establish}} a base at Hargeisa and then carry the main weight of the attack through the Mirgo Pass towards Berbera. The eastern column would move to Odweina to cover the central column's flank <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> to link up with it if necessary. The Italians advanced in three columns, with the western column advancing towards Zeila near the border with French Somaliland, the central column towards Hargeisa and Adadlek, the eastern column towards Odweina and Burao in the south. Lieutenant-General Carlo De Simone commanded the main central column. The SCC skirmished with the Italians as the other British and Commonwealth forces slowly retired. On 5 August, the towns of Zeila and Hargeisa were captured, the occupation of Zeila cutting off British from French Somaliland. Odweina fell the following day and the Italian central and eastern columns combined, to launch attacks against the main British positions at Tug Argan. On 11 August, Major-General Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen, reached Berbera to take over command.|$|E
25|$|The cloth badge was {{introduced}} for Eagle Scouts attending the 2nd World Scout Jamboree in Denmark in 1924 with a design {{based on the}} hat pin. The Eagle Scout merit badge was sewn onto {{the top of the}} merit badge sash that was also created for the jamboree. The design is quite similar to the current badge. As with other patches of the time, the rank badges were embroidered onto rolls of fabric and then cut. The edges were folded under before sewing the badge onto the sash. Initially produced on tan cloth, it was later switched to olive for the Boy Scout uniform and white and blue to match the various Sea Scout uniforms. In 1933, BSA was removed from all of the Eagle Scout insignia, including the badge. The text Eagle Scout and Boy Scouts of America was added to the border, <b>and</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Prepared</b> was added to the scroll. These badges were embroidered with silk thread, switching to cotton in 1940.|$|E
25|$|At 1030 {{hours on}} the morning of 24 November Seneca hailed Tomoka in {{latitude}} 40° 21.6' North, longitude 73° 49.7' West and ordered her to heave to <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> to be boarded and examined. A surfboat with an armed boarding party in charge of Lieutenant L. W. Perkins was sent to go on board and take charge of the vessel. At first Tomoka broke out the British flag and cruised about so that the boarding party would not overtake her. Seneca called her gun crews to quarters, cast loose the number one gun, and then ordered Tomoka to permit the boat to board. The master then complied. At 12:00 the boarding officer reported that he was all right and requested the Seneca to go ahead and he would follow with Tomoka. Seneca shaped a course for the Ambrose Channel lightship, but by 12:30 Tomoka had still not started to follow. Heading back for the rum-runner Seneca was met by her boarding party, which had been chased off Tomoka with a machinegun.|$|E

25|$|On Thursday morning, the mutineers went {{to protest}} {{at the gates}} of Philomel, but found them to be manned by a party of petty officers, {{supported}} by the police. Just before 08:00, Phipps announced that all sailors were to report for duty by 10:00 <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>prepared</b> to accept the consequences of the mutiny—anyone who did not would be discharged. The government was aware that a large number were unlikely to accept the offer, and accepted that this act would set the development of the RNZN back by several years. After the sailors returned to the reserve, Dr. Finlay advised them that they would likely forfeit all veterans' benefits if they persisted in their actions, but the warning had the opposite effect to that intended. The majority of the mutineers stripped off their rank and category insignias, medal ribbons, and good conduct badges, and returned to the base to collect their effects. However, the Master-At-Arms would only allow them onto the base individually and with an escort, and they could only claim their belongings after returning all items of uniform and equipment, even if they had been paid for through wage deductions.|$|E
