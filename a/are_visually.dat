AMI-tv broadcasts a selection of general entertainment programming with accommodations for those who <b>are</b> <b>visually</b> or hearing impaired, with audio descriptions on the primary audio track and closed captioning available across all programming.

In November 2009 RNC announced {{that it had been}} forced to send a third of its students home following an outbreak of swine flu on campus. During the heavy winter snowfall of 2009–2010 the college's sports facilities were utilised by the Hereford United team for training after the bad weather conditions made using their own grounds at Edgar Street difficult.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge of the {{clitoris}} {{is significantly}} impacted by cultural {{perceptions of the}} organ. Studies suggest that knowledge of its existence and anatomy is scant in comparison with that of other sexual organs, and that more education about it could help alleviate social stigmas associated with the female body and female sexual pleasure; for example, that the clitoris and vulva in general <b>are</b> <b>visually</b> unappealing, that female masturbation is taboo, or that men {{should be expected to}} master and control women's orgasms.|$|E

5|$|Mushers {{must start}} the race with at most {{fourteen}} dogs and finish with {{no fewer than}} six. Dogs <b>are</b> <b>visually</b> examined by veterinarians stationed at every checkpoint, and mushers can be ejected and banned from the race for mistreating dogs. Dog whips and forced feeding are forbidden. Participating dogs may not receive injections during the race or be {{under the influence of}} performance-enhancing substances such as steroids.

5|$|The manga {{has become}} one of Shueisha's bestsellers, with over 22.5 million copies sold. In Japan and North America, several {{individual}} volumes have appeared in weekly top-ten lists of bestselling manga. Although most reviewers found it similar to other series for the same demographic, they compared its moments of originality and well-developed characters favorably to other shōnen series. Hoshino's artwork has received mixed reviews; critics commented that her characters <b>are</b> <b>visually</b> appealing, but her fight sequences are difficult to follow.|$|E
5|$|Abramson was {{a leading}} {{architect}} of synagogue-centers at that time. He designed a number of New York examples, including the original synagogue-center, the Manhattan Jewish Center (1918), {{as well as the}} Brooklyn Jewish Center, the Flatbush Jewish Center, and the Ocean Parkway Jewish Center (all constructed in Brooklyn between 1920 and 1924). While the Flatbush Jewish Center has been completely remodeled, the Brooklyn and Ocean Parkway Jewish Centers <b>are</b> <b>visually</b> similar to the East Midwood Jewish Center, and the Brooklyn Jewish Center in particular has an identical layout. The written evidence consists of an entry in a souvenir journal commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the Flatbush Jewish Center, stating that Abramson drew East Midwood's plans. The NRHP nomination form speculates that Abramson drew the basic plans for the East Midwood Center, and that the Building Committee completed them, in order to save money.|$|E

5|$|However, {{despite its}} Eastern European location, Syldavia itself was partly {{a metaphor for}} Belgium, with Syldavian King Muskar XII {{physically}} resembling King Leopold III of Belgium. Hergé's decision to create a fictional East European kingdom might {{have been influenced by}} Ruritania, the fictional country created by Anthony Hope for his novel The Prisoner of Zenda (1894) and which subsequently appeared in film adaptations in 1913, 1915, 1922, and 1937. Many places within Syldavia <b>are</b> <b>visually</b> based on pre-existing European sites: the Diplodocus in the Klow Natural History Museum is based on the one in the Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin; the Syldavian Royal Palace is based on both the Charlottenburg Palace, Berlin and the Royal Palace of Brussels; and Kropow Castle is based on Olavinlinna Castle, constructed in fifteenth century Savonia - a historical province of the Swedish Kingdom, located in modern-day Finland. For the revised version, Kropow Castle was drawn with an additional tower, inspired by Vyborg Castle, Russia. The United Kingdom also bore at least one influence on Syldavia, as King Muskar XII's carriage is based on the British Royal Family's Gold State Coach.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, NBC Sports {{provided}} five-and-a-half {{hours of}} coverage in total, and no live coverage. Pay TV channel NBC Sports Network aired one-hour highlight shows on 4, 5, 6 and 11 September while NBC broadcast a special recapping the Games on 16 September – a week following their conclusion. The United States Olympic Committee provided additional coverage through its own digital outlets. Critics and American athletes expressed disappointment at NBC for its {{decision not to}} broadcast any {{live coverage of the}} Games, continuing the broadcaster's trend of providing minimal coverage for the Paralympics. In Canada, rights were held by Canada's Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium; TSN (English) and RDS (French) produced daily hour-long highlight programs (some of which were aired by CTV Television), while tape-delayed airings of the opening ceremony were carried by Sportsnet One, TSN2, RDS, and RDS2. The coverage was simulcast with open audio descriptions by AMI-tv, a network which broadcasts programming with accommodations for those who <b>are</b> <b>visually</b> or hearing impaired. AMI-tv also broadcast supplemental programming, such as a daily news program from London and a documentary series focusing on Canadian athletes at the Paralympics.|$|E
