5|$|The cool, damp habitat {{provided}} by the bogs <b>at</b> <b>Black</b> Moshannon State Park provides a home for some birds {{that are at the}} southern limit of their habitat in central Pennsylvania. The Canada warbler and northern waterthrush nest in the bogs, as do the alder flycatcher, common yellowthroat, swamp sparrow, red-winged blackbird, and gray catbird. The olive-sided flycatcher, which is designated as locally extinct in Pennsylvania, has been seen during the breeding season <b>at</b> <b>Black</b> Moshannon State Natural Area. Bird watchers have observed nesting barred owls in the IBA, as well as Virginia rail and sora.|$|E
5|$|Most of the CCC-built park {{facilities}} {{are still in}} use today, including log cabins, picnic pavilions, a food concession stand, and miles of trails. Early on, the CCC constructed a dam <b>at</b> <b>Black</b> Moshannon Lake, {{on the site of}} the former mill pond dam. CCC Camp S-71closed in January 1937and Black Moshannon State Park officially re-opened that same year.|$|E

The Jamaican Vice-Admiralty court upheld the {{legality}} of the British capture of Zong from the Dutch, and the syndicate renamed the ship Richard of Jamaica. Luke Collingwood died three days after Zong reached Jamaica, two years before the 1783 court proceedings about the case.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} facilities <b>at</b> <b>Black</b> Moshannon State Park {{were constructed}} by the Civilian Conservation Corps, from 1933to 1937. The CCC created many jobs for unemployed industrial workers from throughout the United States.

However, many people used the area for recreation {{as far back as the}} early 1900s.|$|E
5|$|There are seventy-two {{campsite}}s <b>at</b> <b>Black</b> Moshannon State Park. Each campsite {{has access}} to washhouses with flush toilets, showers, and laundry tubs. The campsites also have fire rings and picnic tables. There is also an organized group tenting area, which can accommodate a group of up to 60persons. Some sites allow pets; there are also twelve full hook-up sites available. These have electric service, water and sewer hook-ups as well. Nine sites are tent-only.|$|E

In 2009, Turkey Point was proposed as the site of two new 1117MW AP1000 nuclear reactors, to be designated Turkey Point 6 and 7. If built, the new reactors would make Turkey Point one of the largest generating sites in the United States. Other neighboring influences on the bay are the agricultural lands of south Miami-Dade County, a sewage treatment facility on the park boundary <b>at</b> <b>Black</b> Point, and its neighbor, the South Miami-Dade Landfill.|$|E

5|$|After {{the slave}} ship reached port <b>at</b> <b>Black</b> River, Jamaica, Zongs owners made {{a claim to}} their {{insurers}} {{for the loss of}} the slaves. When the insurers refused to pay, the resulting court cases (Gregson v Gilbert (1783) 3 Doug. KB 232) held that in some circumstances, the deliberate killing of slaves was legal and that insurers could be required to pay for the slaves' deaths. The judge, Lord Chief Justice, the Earl of Mansfield, ruled against the syndicate owners in this case, due to new evidence being introduced suggesting the captain and crew were at fault.|$|E
5|$|Black American Sign Language (BASL) or Black Sign Variation (BSV) is a dialect of American Sign Language (ASL) {{used most}} {{commonly}} by deaf African Americans in the United States. The divergence from ASL was influenced {{largely by the}} segregation of schools in the American South. Like other schools at the time, schools for the deaf were segregated based upon race, creating two language communities among deaf signers: White deaf signers at White schools and Black deaf signers <b>at</b> <b>Black</b> schools. Today, BASL is still used by signers in the South despite public schools having been legally desegregated since 1954.|$|E

Pipelines and {{refineries}} were built throughout much of Southeast Texas, leading to substantial industrialization, particularly around Houston and the Galveston Bay. The first offshore oilfield in the state opened in 1917 <b>at</b> <b>Black</b> Duck Bay on the Goose Creek field, although serious offshore exploration did not begin until the 1930s.|$|E

Black visits Hance in prison, and upon {{speaking}} to Hance, realizes that Tyler believes himself Hance's reincarnation, aspiring to follow his methods exactly. Meanwhile, Tyler calls the police and leaves an anonymous tip, telling them that the liquor store murderer is hiding in an abandoned building. Black accompanies a SWAT team encircling the building, but the officers come under sniper fire from a construction site across the street. Black and Bletcher separate as they search for Tyler, who gets the drop on Black. Black disarms Tyler, attempting to talk him into surrendering. Tyler empties a handgun <b>at</b> <b>Black,</b> but misses; when Bletcher confronts him, Tyler points the gun and Bletcher instinctively shoots and kills him.|$|E
5|$|Longstanding racial {{tensions}} between {{whites and blacks}} exploded in five days of violence that started on July 27, 1919. On that hot summer day, on a segregated Chicago beach, a white man was throwing rocks <b>at</b> <b>black</b> swimmers in the water at a beach on the South Side which resulted in Eugene Williams' death. Tensions escalated when a white police officer not only failed to arrest the white man responsible for Williams' death, but arrested a black man instead. Objections by black observers were met with violence by whites. Attacks between white and black mobs erupted swiftly. At one point, a white mob threatened Provident Hospital, many of whose patients were African American. The police successfully held them off.|$|E

His squad discuss their deployment, {{somewhat}} irritated {{that they have}} not been told what they are being deployed for. However, as they are nearing their Landing Zone <b>at</b> <b>Black</b> Mesa, airborne alien creatures attack the Osprey formation, causing Shephard's Osprey to crash land. Shephard regains consciousness in a Black Mesa medical bay, tended to by the science team, learning that the Marines are being steadily beaten by the alien forces from Xen and orders have come through to pull out.

5|$|The non-denominational Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade {{was founded}} in 1787.

Then in 1791, Parliament prohibited insurance companies from reimbursing ship owners in cases in which slaves were thrown overboard. The massacre has also inspired works of art and literature. It was commemorated in London in 2007, among events to mark the bicentenary of the British Slave Trade Act 1807, which abolished the African slave trade. A monument to the killed slaves on Zong was installed <b>at</b> <b>Black</b> River, Jamaica, their intended port.|$|E
