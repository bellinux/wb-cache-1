25|$|Worldwide, {{road traffic}} is {{becoming}} ever safer, {{in part due}} to efforts by the government to implement safety features in cars (e.g., seat belts, <b>air</b> <b>bags,</b> etc.), reduce unsafe driving practices (e.g., speeding, drinking and driving and texting and driving) and make road design more safe by adding features such as speed bumps, which reduce vehicle speed, and roundabouts, which reduce the likelihood of a head-on-collision (as compared with an intersection).|$|E
25|$|Commotio cordis {{may also}} occur in other situations, {{such as in}} {{children}} who are punished with blows over the precordium, cases of torture, and frontal collisions of motor vehicles (the impact of the steering wheel against the thorax, although this has decreased substantially {{with the use of}} safety belts and <b>air</b> <b>bags).</b> In one fatality, the impact to the chest was the result of an exploding whipping cream canister.|$|E

If the communication equipment is improperly installed and the <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> inflates, this could cause serious injury. • Installation of vehicle communication equipment should be performed by a professional installer/technician qualified in the requirements for such installations. An <b>air</b> <b>bag’s</b> size, shape and deployment area can vary by vehicle make, model and front compartment configuration (e. g., bench seat vs. bucket seats). • Contact the vehicle manufacturer’s corporate headquarters, if necessary, for specific <b>air</b> <b>bag</b> information for the vehi-cle make, model and front compartment configuration involved in your communication equipment installation. FCC Safety Information The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), with its action in General Docket 79 - 144, March 13, 1985, has adopted a safety standard for human exposure to radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic energy emitted by FCC-regulated equip-ment.

25|$|In 1911, Lieutenant Longmore and Oswald Short {{installed}} streamlined <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> on the undercarriage struts {{and under}} the tail of Improved S.27 No. 38 to enable the aircraft to land on water. On 1 December 1911, Longmore used the aircraft {{to become the first}} person in the United Kingdom to take off from land and make a successful water landing when he landed in the river Medway off Sheerness, after which No.38 was brought ashore and flown back to Eastchurch. A flying-off platform was constructed over the foredeck and forward 12-inch (305mm) gun turret of the pre-dreadnought battleship HMS Africa, and on 10 January 1912 Samson, piloting No.38, used the platform while Africa was anchored off Sheerness to make the United Kingdom’s first successful aeroplane take-off from a ship. The platform was later transferred to the battleship HMS Hibernia.|$|E

500|$|Vehicle-related SCI is {{prevented}} with measures including societal {{and individual}} {{efforts to reduce}} {{driving under the influence}} of drugs or alcohol, distracted driving, and drowsy driving. [...] Other efforts include increasing road safety (such as marking hazards and adding lighting) and vehicle safety, both to prevent accidents (such as routine maintenance and antilock brakes) and to mitigate the damage of crashes (such as [...] head restraints, <b>air</b> <b>bags,</b> seat belts, and child safety seats). [...] Falls can be prevented by making changes to the environment, such as nonslip materials and grab bars in bathtubs and showers, railings for stairs, child and safety gates for windows. Gun-related injuries can be prevented with conflict resolution training, gun safety education campaigns, and changes to the technology of guns (such as trigger locks) to improve their safety. [...] Sports injuries can be prevented with changes to sports rules and equipment to increase safety, and education campaigns to reduce risky practices such as diving into water of unknown depth or head-first tackling in association football.|$|E
500|$|While {{filming the}} scenes {{where the family}} pushes the van to get it started, a stunt {{coordinator}} was used {{to ensure the safety}} of the actors. In an interview, actor Greg Kinnear jokingly described how the scenes were filmed when he was driving: [...] "I was going like 50 miles an hour in this '71 VW van that doesn't have side <b>air</b> <b>bags.</b> Basically you'd wait for this huge camera truck to come whizzing in front of us with the camera. 'Okay, go!' I mean, it was insanity; it's the most dangerous movie I've ever made." [...] While filming the scenes in the van, the actors would at times remain in the vehicle for three or four hours a day. For scenes in which Alan Arkin's character was swearing excessively, Breslin had her headphones on and could not hear the dialogue, just like her character in the film. Only when she saw the film did she know what was being said. On July 25, 2006 Fox Searchlight Pictures invited VW bus owners to a screening at Vineland Drive-In theater in Industry, California. Over 60 of the vans were present at the screening.|$|E

A New York City firefighter, Tim Brown, was a consultant for most of the technical information in the episode. In addition to helping Yoshimura with the dialogue from medical staff characters, Brown advised Yoshimura on the method of using <b>air</b> <b>bags</b> to push the subway train forward and remove Lange's body. Yoshimura included conflicting reports from witnesses about how the incident took place, which the writer described as a [...] "Rashomon thing", in reference to the 1950 Japanese film in which several characters offer differing descriptions of the same murder. [...] "Subway" [...] continued a sixth season trend in which the detectives became more personally involved with the victims, and thus becoming more emotionally drained at their deaths. For example, in the episode [...] "Birthday", which aired a month earlier, Falsone interviewed a victim who eventually died at the conclusion of the episode.
