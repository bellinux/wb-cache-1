5|$|During {{the week}} before his death, {{he was dealing with}} two pending lawsuits, one a {{paternity}} case and the other a recording contract dispute that was due to be heard by a UK High Court the following week. He was also troubled with wanting to leave his manager, Michael Jeffery. Hendrix was fatigued and suffering from poor health, due in part to severe exhaustion caused by overworking, a chronic lack of sleep, and a persistent illness assumed to be influenza-related. Lacking trusting personal relationships, his insecurities <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>and</b> disillusionment with the music industry contributed to his frustration.|$|E

25|$|Locus {{of control}} {{generated}} much research {{in a variety}} of areas in psychology. The construct is applicable to such fields as educational psychology, health psychology and clinical psychology. Debate continues whether specific or more global measures of locus of control will prove to be more useful in practical application. Careful distinctions should also be made between locus of control (a concept linked with expectancies <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>future)</b> <b>and</b> attributional style (a concept linked with explanations for past outcomes), or between locus of control and concepts such as self-efficacy.|$|E
25|$|At the Cowles Commission, Simon’s {{main goal}} was to link {{economic}} theory to mathematics and statistics. His main contributions were to the fields of general equilibrium and econometrics. He was greatly influenced by the marginalist debate {{that began in the}} 1930s. The popular work of the time argued that it was not apparent empirically that entrepreneurs needed to follow the marginalist principles of profit-maximization/cost-minimization in running organizations. The argument went on to note that profit-maximization was not accomplished, in part, {{because of the lack of}} complete information. In decision-making, Simon believed that agents face uncertainty <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>and</b> costs in acquiring information in the present. These factors limit the extent to which agents may make a fully rational decision, thus they possess only “bounded rationality” and must make decisions by “satisficing,” or choosing that which might not be optimal, but which will make them happy enough. Bounded rationality is a central theme in behavioral economics. It is concerned with the ways in which the actual decision making process influences decision. Theories of bounded rationality relax one or more assumptions of standard expected utility theory.|$|E
25|$|Near {{the end of}} the book, Jaypaw and Leafpool must go to WindClan to take Onestar {{a message}} from Firestar about not {{shedding}} unnecessary blood in a battle over something that may never happen, while Hollypaw convinces Mousefur and Firestar to do something to help RiverClan. When they arrive, WindClan queen Gorsetail's kits (Sedgekit, Thistlekit and Swallowkit) are missing and WindClan blames RiverClan, saying {{that there will be a}} battle if RiverClan does not return the kits. Jaypaw and Leafpool return to camp and Lionpaw tells his brother and sister about the tunnels, where he thinks the kits may have gone. They enter the caves, coincidentally meeting up with the WindClan apprentices Breezepaw and Heatherpaw, who share their motive for being there. Jaypaw is guided by the spirit of Fallen Leaves and the group finds the kits behind a boulder that blocked the tunnel. It starts raining and the tunnel floods, but Jaypaw figures a way out just in time and they return the kits, saving the Clans from an unnecessary battle. So Breezepaw, Heatherpaw, Jaypaw, Lionpaw, and Hollypaw return the kits back to WindClan and avert the battle. Then, once again, Lionpaw and Heatherpaw meet up again. They both talk <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>and</b> how they want things to go.|$|E

500|$|Fouad Ajami criticised Aflaq {{for a lack}} of real substance, stating, [...] "Nearly {{three hundred}} pages of text yield no insight, on his part, into what went wrong and what needed to be done; there is only the visible infatuation with words" [...] and [...] "Aflaq summons the party to renounce power and go back to its 'pure essence'". There is some truth in this critique. Aflaq spent much time and energy writing optimistically <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> <b>and</b> the past, of the Arab Nation, and of how the Arab World could be unified. As Kanan Makiya, the author of Republic of Fear: The Politics of Modern Iraq, notes: for [...] "Aflaq, reality is {{confined}} to the inner world of the party." [...] In contrast to other philosophers, such as Karl Marx or John Locke, Aflaq's ideological view of the world makes no clear stand on the materialistic or socioeconomic behavior of humanity. While other philosophers make distinctions between what is real and what is not real, that is between prescriptive and descriptive analysis, [...] Aflaq did not as a rule define what is and what ought to be. [...] In his thought both are molded into the same category: that which is attainable.|$|E
500|$|... "Kicking and Screaming" [...] is {{the most}} {{prominent}} representation of rock music on The Time of Our Lives. The track features instrumentation that relies on glam electric guitar riffing and ragged, gutsy vocals, which, at several points, feature a gravelly element. It results in an uptempo electronic rock number. Lyrically, [...] "Kicking and Screaming" [...] is a merciless message to an ex-boyfriend. [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] mixes R and pop music elements while having instrumentation that includes a [...] "clash between feathery jazz guitar chords and a booming synth bassline serving as a hook". Cyrus' vocals display an undertone of alternative country twang and features belter refrains. The lyrics for [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] discuss Cyrus' relocation from Nashville, Tennessee to Hollywood, California. The refrains mainly speak of how her favorite songs make her feel more confident. [...] "When I Look at You" [...] is a power ballad that transitions in instrumentation, from piano to electric guitar. Throughout the song, Cyrus keeps a hushed tone, but starts to belt soon {{before the arrival of}} the second verse. Lyrically, it speaks of a dream lover. [...] "The Time of Our Lives" [...] is a bouncy, dance-pop song characterized by 1980s synths and a fizzy sound caused by a bubblegum pop background. Cyrus' processed vocals display a prominent use of auto-tune; influences derive from new wave music. The song's lyrics talk about not worrying so much <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>and</b> simply focusing on the present and having a good time together. [...] "Talk Is Cheap" [...] is a pop-punk, garage rock song with disco influences and a number of hooks. [...] "Talk Is Cheap" [...] features lyrics that speak of being extremely irritated after encountering predicaments at a club and others smoking cigarettes. [...] "Obsessed" [...] is a power ballad with soft rock characteristics and husky vocals. [...] "Obsessed"'s lyrics deal with teenage lust. [...] "Before the Storm" [...] is a country pop ballad about a melancholic romantic breakup.|$|E

2500|$|Mania is the {{defining}} feature of bipolar disorder and can occur with {{different levels of}} severity.

As hypomania worsens, individuals begin to exhibit erratic and impulsive behavior, often making poor decisions due to unrealistic ideas <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> <b>and</b> sleep less. At the extreme, manic individuals can experience distorted or delusional beliefs about the universe, hallucinate, hear voices, {{to the point of}} [...] psychosis.
