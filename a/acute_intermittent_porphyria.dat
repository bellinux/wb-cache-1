5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} debates as {{to the nature of}} Van Gogh's illness and its effect on his work, and many retrospective diagnoses have been proposed. The consensus is that Van Gogh had an episodic condition with periods of normal functioning. Perry was the first to suggest bipolar disorder in 1947, and this has been supported by the psychiatrists Hemphill and Blumer. Biochemist Wilfred Arnold has countered that the symptoms are more consistent with <b>acute</b> <b>intermittent</b> <b>porphyria,</b> noting that the popular link between bipolar disorder and creativity might be spurious. Temporal lobe epilepsy with bouts of depression has also been suggested. Whatever the diagnosis, his condition was likely worsened by malnutrition, overwork, insomnia and alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Stacy Warner is {{a fictional}} {{recurring}} character portrayed by Sela Ward on the Fox Broadcasting Company's medical drama House. She {{was in a}} relationship with Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), when a clotted aneurysm in his right thigh led to an infarction during a game of golf, causing his quadriceps muscle to become necrotic. Regarding House's treatment, Stacy acted against House's wishes when he was put into a chemically induced coma. She authorized a safer surgical middle-ground procedure by removing just the dead muscle, leaving House with a lesser, but serious, level of pain {{for the rest of his}} life. House could not forgive her and they broke up. The two meet again, five years later, at the end of season one; Stacy wants House to treat her husband, Mark. House correctly diagnoses Mark with <b>acute</b> <b>intermittent</b> <b>porphyria,</b> and so he has to remain at the hospital for close monitoring. Stacy becomes the hospital's lawyer, and she and House grow closer together. When she is ultimately willing to leave Mark for him, House tells her to go back to Mark, which devastates her and causes her and Mark to leave the city.|$|E
40|$|<b>Intermittent</b> <b>acute</b> <b>porphyria</b> has {{recently}} been distinguished biochemically from other genetic hepatic porphyrias by the observation of diminished hepatic uroporphyrinogen I synthetase activity and increased δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase activity. Since deficient uroporphyrinogen I synthetase may be reflected in nonhepatic tissues, we have assayed this enzyme in red cell hemolysates from nonporphyric subjects and from patients with genetic hepatic porphyria. Only patients with <b>intermittent</b> <b>acute</b> <b>porphyria</b> had decreased erythrocyte uroporphyrinogen I synthetase activity which was approximately 50 % of normal.

25|$|The pathway is {{initiated}} by the synthesis of D-aminolevulinic acid (dALA or δALA) from the amino acid glycine and succinyl-CoA from the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle). The rate-limiting enzyme responsible for this reaction, ALA synthase, is negatively regulated by glucose and heme concentration. Mechanism of inhibition of ALAs by heme or hemin is by decreasing stability of mRNA synthesis and by decreasing the intake of mRNA in the mitochondria. This mechanism is of therapeutic importance: infusion of heme arginate or hematin and glucose can abort attacks of <b>acute</b> <b>intermittent</b> <b>porphyria</b> in patients with an inborn error of metabolism of this process, by reducing transcription of ALA synthase.|$|E
25|$|The organs mainly {{involved}} in heme synthesis are the liver (in which {{the rate of}} synthesis is highly variable, depending on the systemic heme pool) and the bone marrow (in which rate of synthesis of Heme is relatively constant and depends on the production of globin chain), although every cell requires heme to function properly. However, due to its toxic properties, proteins such as Hemopexin (Hx) are required to help maintain physiological stores of iron {{in order for them}} to be used in synthesis. Heme is seen as an intermediate molecule in catabolism of hemoglobin in the process of bilirubin metabolism. Defects in various enzymes in synthesis of heme can lead to group of disorder called porphyrias, these include <b>acute</b> <b>intermittent</b> <b>porphyria,</b> congenital erythropoetic porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda, hereditary coproporphyria, variegate porphyria, erythropoietic protoporphyria.|$|E
25|$|The acute {{porphyria}}s are <b>acute</b> <b>intermittent</b> <b>porphyria</b> (AIP), {{variegate porphyria}} (VP), amino levulinic acid dehydratase deficiency (ALAD) and hereditary coproporphyria (HCP). These diseases primarily affect the nervous system, resulting in episodic crises known as acute attacks. The major symptom of an acute attack is abdominal pain, {{often accompanied by}} vomiting, hypertension (elevated blood pressure), and tachycardia (an abnormally rapid heart rate). The most severe episodes may involve neurological complications: typically motor neuropathy (severe dysfunction of the peripheral nerves that innervate muscle), which leads to muscle weakness and potentially to quadriplegia (paralysis of all four limbs) and central nervous system symptoms such as seizures and coma. Occasionally, there may be short-lived psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, and, very rarely, overt psychosis. All these symptoms resolve once the acute attack passes. Porphyria is not a cause of chronic psychiatric illness, though an association with anxiety and depression has been suggested.|$|E
40|$|Background: Porphyrin {{metabolism}} disorders, {{known as}} porphyria, represent inherited or acquired diseases. The development of porphyria due to light sensibility occurs especially with exposure to wavelengths {{in the range}} of 300 - 700 nm. Skin reactions and neurovisceral dysfunctions are known side effects of ionizing irradiation. It can be postulated that during or after ionizing irradiation treatment of patients affected with tumor and porphyria, severe side effects might appear, in contrast to patients without porphyria. This paper describes the treatment of 2 patients affected with tumor and concomitant porphyria. Patients: One female patient suffering from <b>intermittent</b> <b>porphyria</b> and breast cancer and one male patient suffering from porphyria cutanea tarda and bladder cancer were treated with ionizing irradiation (electrons and photons). No abnormalities nor any severe general or local side effects could be observed. Conclusion: Radiation therapy is not a `stimulating' factor in activating porphyria symptoms. ...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Respiratory neural {{networks}} can adapt to rapid environmental change or be altered {{over the long}} term by various inputs. The mechanisms that underlie the plasticity necessary for adaptive changes in breathing remain unclear. <b>Acute</b> <b>intermittent</b> hypoxia (AIH) -induced respiratory long-term facilitation (LTF) {{is one of the most}} extensively studied types of respiratory plasticity. <b>Acute</b> <b>intermittent</b> hypoxia-induced LTF is present in several respiratory motor outputs, innervating both pump muscles (i. e. diaphragm) and valve muscles (i. e. tongue, pharynx and larynx). Long-term facilitation is present in various species, including humans, and the expression of LTF is influenced by gender, age and genetics. Serotonin plays a key role in initiating and modulating plasticity at the level of respiratory motor neurons. Recently, multiple intracellular pathways have been elucidated that are capable of giving rise to respiratory LTF. These mainly activate the metabolic receptors coupled to Gq ('Q' pathway) and Gs ('S' pathway) proteins. Herein, we discuss AIH-induced respiratory LTF in animals and humans, as well as recent advances in our understanding of the synaptic and intracellular pathways underlying this form of plasticity. We also discuss the potential to use intermittent hypoxia to induce functional recovery following cervical spinal injury. 8 page(s...|$|R

[...] Biochemical and molecular testing can be used to narrow down the diagnosis of a porphyria and identify the specific genetic defect. [...] Overall, porphyrias are rare diseases.
