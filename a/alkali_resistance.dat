Association of the alpha polypeptide with the microsomal membranes was obtained only co-translationally.

30|$|In case {{of current}} {{variation}} with time, {{it was observed}} to increase with time for both RPSu-PVP and PSDVB-based IEM systems as shown in Fig.  9 because of the production of OH−/H+ during water dissociation. In other words, {{at the beginning of}} the experiments, AC and BC initially have distilled water with very low concentrations of acid and <b>alkali.</b> So the <b>resistances</b> offered by these compartments were very high as compared to the resistance offered by FC. As time passes, the concentrations of AC and BC increased because of the continuous formation of acid and alkali in these compartments and all the solutions were being continuously recycled. Hence, the resistance of these compartments was decreased. On the other hand, the concentration of salt in FC decreased due to the continuous transport of ions from these compartments. As a result, the resistance of these compartments increased. The net effect was the overall decrease in stack resistance with time, resulting in an increase in current production with time. But in the case of RPSu-PVP-based system, unlike that of the PSDVB-based system, the final current was slightly lower due to the concentration polarization phenomenon and difference in membrane resistance in the stack.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop hybrid {{copolymers}} through the copolymerisation of a novel low molecular weight oleic acid-based macromer with methyl methacrylate (MMA), with the aim of combining the good properties of alkyd and acrylic binders. Design/methodology/approach - The macromer was synthesised from phthalic anhydride, oleic acid and glycerol. It was copolymerised with MMA using a free radical initiator. The ratio of the macromer and MMA was varied and the glass transition temperature, molecular weight, thermal stability, and film properties of the copolymers were characterised. Findings - Under similar conditions of temperature and reaction time, the lower macromer to MMA ratio has led to faster polymerisation rate, higher molecular weight and higher T g of the copolymer. Generally, all the coatings showed excellent adhesion properties, while the coatings with the higher content of MMA exhibited better <b>alkali</b> and water <b>resistance.</b> Research limitations/implications - The macromer used in the present context was synthesised from oleic acid and glycerol supplied by a local palm oil oleochemicals manufacturer. Presumably the same raw materials from other vegetable oils could also be used. In addition, the macromer structure could be changed by varying the formulation so that it would have different molecular weight and functionality. Practical implications - The method has managed to combine the properties of alkyd and acrylic, resulting in coatings that exhibit good mechanical and chemical properties, fast physical drying as well as excellent adhesion. Originality/value - Oleic acid and glycerol are palm oil derivatives which are from natural resources and are sustainable raw materials. Although the macromer by itself cannot air-dry due low iodine value, this could be overcome through copolymerisation with methyl methacrylate to find numerous applications in surface coating...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} new {{engineering}} materials in aerospace applications and in stationary power turbine blades for high-efficiency energy-generating equipment {{has led to a}} rapid development of ceramic coatings. They can be tailored to have superior physical (high specific strength and stiffness, enhanced high-temperature performance) and chemical (high-temperature corrosion resistance in more aggressive fuel environments) properties than those of monolithic ceramic materials. Among the major chemical properties of SiAlON-Y ceramics are their good corrosion resistance against aggressive media combined with good thermal shock behavior. The good corrosion resistance results from the yttria-alumina-garnet (YAG), Al{sub 5 }Y{sub 3 }O{sub 12 }, formed during the corrosion process of SiAlON-Y ceramics in combustion gases at 1300 C. The interfacial chemical precipitation of the YAG phase is beneficial. This phase may crystallize in cubic and/or tetragonal modifications and if formed in SiAlON-Y ceramic may simultaneously generate residual stress. Also, this phase can contain a large number of point defects, which is a consequence of the large unit cell and complexity of the YAG structure because it has no close-packed oxygen planes. Therefore, the need exists to elucidate the corrosion mechanism of a multilayered barrier with respect to using SiAlON-YAG as a corrosion-protective coating. Stress corrosion cracking in the grain boundary of a silicon nitride (Si{sub 3 }N{sub 4 }) ceramic enriched in a glassy phase such as SiAlON can significantly affect its mechanical properties. It has been suggested that the increased resistance of the oxynitride glass to stress corrosion is related to the increased surface potential of the fracture surface created in the more durable and highly cross-linked oxynitride glass network structure. We expect that either increased or decreased surface potential of the intergranular glassy phase is brought about by changes in the residual stress of the SiAlON-Y ceramic and/or creation of a space-charge region at the SiAlON-YAG interface. Both features originate from a secondary phase of YAG formed during the SiAlON-Y glass corrosion process. Conventional oxidation-protection coatings for metallic materials in high-temperature corrosive environments are typically formed by applying a slurry mixture to the surface followed by a high-temperature furnace cure. During the cure, the coating reacts with the alloy to form a layer typically 25 to 50 {micro}m{sup 3 } thick. Generally, coating thickness is one critical microstructural parameter that influences its performance; therefore, its optimization is an important aspect of coating technology. The aim of the present research program is (1) to produce a thin SiAlON-YAG ceramic coating with a high quality of interface, (2) to understand the major experimental characteristics for creating a good bonding between a substrate and a thin coating, and (3) to explain why the Al{sub 5 }Y{sub 3 }O{sub 12 } phase increases SiAlON-Y ceramic <b>alkali</b> corrosion <b>resistance.</b> To produce the SiAlON-Y coating on silicon nitride ceramic with a YAG layer, a slurry mixture of SiAlON-Y components was designed. The research program was extended to Y{sub 2 }SiO{sub 5 } coating to get preliminary information on the Si{sub 3 }N{sub 4 }-Y{sub 2 }SiO{sub 5 } interface microstructure. It was expected that this phase would have a very low porosity. Generally, coatings that contain ductile phases such as Y{sub 2 }SiO{sub 5 } can produce low-porosity coatings...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Alginate fiber is a {{new type}} of green {{functional}} textile materials that can biodegradation, these years more and more people pay great attention to it for its excellent properties of antibacterial, moisture-absorption property etc. On the basis of experimental examination, the length wise appearance and cross section appearance, the tensile properties, the moisture-absorbency, property,acid resistance and <b>alkali</b> <b>resistance</b> etc. of the alginate fiber are studied. The conclusions gained in this paper have important reference value to the development of alginate fiber product and its processing...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a case of}} Hb D/Beta thalassemia associated with chronic anemia. Hematological analyses performed in a patient with chronic anemia demonstrating microcytosis and hypochromic in his erythrocytes. Specific laboratory diagnosis performed by alkaline and acid electrophoresis, and fetal determination by <b>alkali</b> <b>resistance,</b> indicated it to be Hb D associated with beta thalassemia. Analyses carried out on his family (father, mother and brother) confirmed the suspected diagnosis. Hb D/Beta thalassemia is a very rare interaction in the Brazilian population, and its determination required specific laboratorial techniques and hematological analyses...|$|E
