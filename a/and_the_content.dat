5|$|Interpretations vary. The canvas {{seems to}} portray {{simultaneously}} a dreaming woman <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> of her nightmare. The incubus and horse's head refer to contemporary belief and folklore about nightmares, {{but have been}} ascribed more specific meanings by some theorists. Contemporary critics were {{taken aback by the}} overt sexuality of the painting, since interpreted by some scholars as anticipating Jungian ideas about the unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Many {{medicinal}} plants produce chemical compounds which {{give them an}} evolutionary advantage, such as defending against herbivores or, like salicylic acid, acting against other plants.

Between 1995 and 1999, Li gave lectures in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Switzerland, and Singapore.

5|$|Imaginos was envisioned {{as a rock}} opera to be {{published}} as a trilogy of double albums, with a storyline encompassing about two hundred years of history, {{from the beginning of}} the 19th century to the end of the 20th. This album represents an abbreviated version of the first volume of that planned trilogy, but with the songs arranged out of order, rendering the story harder to comprehend. Even when the song lyrics are analyzed in the chronological order that was devised by the authors and is followed in this section, the narrative progression is scarce <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> often difficult to decipher for the casual reader. However, thanks to various comments in interviews by Pearlman and Bouchard, and the extensive sleeve notes by Pearlman that were issued with the original release, it is possible to reconstruct the story to a great extent.|$|E
5|$|On January 31, 2003, Snow was {{released}} {{as both a}} CD-ROM and DVD-ROM compatible to the Windows 98/ME/2000/XP operating systems. An all-ages version for the Dreamcast {{was released}} by Interchannel on September 25, 2003. Later on February 26, 2004, Interchannel ported the game to the PlayStation 2 in both limited and regular editions; the PS2 port adds an additional scenario for Meiko Tachibana, who was a supporting character in prior releases of Snow. A full voice version was released for Windows on September 24, 2004. Then on September 29, 2006, Snow: Plus Edition was released for Windows, sporting added parts from the console versions and introducing a new heroine. Snow is playable on NTT DoCoMo's FOMA cell phones. A PlayStation Portable version of the game called Snow: Portable was released by Prototype on August 16, 2007. The standard edition for Windows was released on July 25, 2008, containing two fan discs, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> from the portable edition of Snow. Finally, a downloadable version of the PSP edition was made available on the PlayStation Store by Prototype on January 21, 2010.|$|E

5|$|Registered Nurses: Registered {{nurses are}} {{responsible}} for coordinating {{all aspects of the}} patient's care and insuring symptoms (physical or otherwise) are being addressed and managed. The primary care nurse visits a minimum of twice weekly, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> of the visit can vary greatly. When patients are experiencing few symptoms and/or are early in their diseases, the RN visit may just be a short check up. If a patient's symptoms worsen, the nurse will visit more often, make recommendations for increasing or changing the medication intervention and provide support and education regarding the disease/dying process. Many patients on hospice may require complex treatments: respiratory care, wound care or even IV therapy at home. In most cases, the hospice nurse is trained to handle these unique needs as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} {{and rate of}} CSF generation are influenced by hormones <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> and pressure of blood and CSF. For example, when CSF pressure is higher, there {{is less of a}} pressure difference between the capillary blood in choroid plexuses and the CSF, decreasing the rate at which fluids move into the choroid plexus and CSF generation. The autonomic nervous system influences choroid plexus CSF secretion, with activation of the sympathetic nervous system increasing secretion and the parasympathetic nervous system decreasing it. Changes in the pH of the blood can affect the activity of carbonic anhydrase, and some drugs (such as frusemide, acting on the Na-K-Cl cotransporter) have the potential to impact membrane channels.|$|E

It {{was released}} to LD (as a limited edition) and DVD in January 2001, and to VHS in July 2001.
