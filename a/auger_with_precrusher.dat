50|$|A {{machine was}} {{developed}} that could economically implement an Automated Profile Road Building Method {{and would be}} known as the Autograde. This machine was known as either a “trimmer-spreader” or a fine-grader. It could trim or cut off high spots of a road bed and then spread the soil across the entire width of the road profile. By its very nature it was fine-grading the base course of the new road. The Autograde used an <b>auger</b> <b>with</b> cutting teeth to perform this function.|$|R

5000|$|The modern {{grain auger}} of today's farming {{communities}} {{was invented by}} Peter Pakosh.

Pakosh, however, went on to design and build a first prototype auger in 1945, and 8 years later start selling tens of thousands under the 'Versatile' name, making it the standard for modern grain augers.|$|R

6000|$|Some {{months after}} the marriage, Captain Pierpoint {{arranged}} to take down a scow or flat-bottomed boat, laden with grain, from Milwaukee for the Erie Canal. He took up the scow himself, and before he started for the voyage, it was a curious fact that he went in person down into the hold, bored eight large holes right through the bottom, and filled each up, as he drew out the <b>auger,</b> <b>with</b> a caulked plug made exactly to fit it, and hammered firmly into place with a wooden mallet. There was a ring in each plug, by which it could be pulled out again without much difficulty; and the whole eight were all placed along the gangway of the hold, where no cargo would lie on top of them. The scow's name was the Fortuna: [...] "sit faustum omen et felix," [...] murmured Captain Pierpoint to himself; for among his other accomplishments he had not wholly neglected nor entirely forgotten the classical languages.|$|R

40|$|Sampling {{systems for}} {{population}} studies of subterranean woolly apple aphid, Eriosoma lanigerum (Hausmann) (Homoptera: Aphididae), are not available. Therefore, {{a system for}} monitoring underground population levels of this species was developed. A standard soil sample {{was taken to a}} depth of 15 cm using an <b>auger</b> <b>with</b> an internal diameter of 5 cm. Either a hand or mechanical auger may be used. Distance from the trunks of apple trees, and the amount and nature of root material in the samples, affected the number of aphids recorded. More aphids were recorded in soil samples containing root material, particularly if the roots had galls resulting from the feeding of E. lanigerum, than in samples in which there were no roots. The number of E. lanigerum in samples decreased as the distance from the trunk at which they were taken increased. The distance from the trunk at which samples were taken was standardized to 30 cm. The system will be suitable for detecting changes in subterranean population levels over time and for comparing soil treatments for woolly apple aphid control, but not for decision making regarding the necessity for control actions.
