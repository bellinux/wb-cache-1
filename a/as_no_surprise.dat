5|$|That the {{metallurgy}} {{of plutonium}} was completely unknown came <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> at all, for {{it had only}} recently been discovered. On August 1942, Seaborg's team chemically isolated the first weighable amount of plutonium from uranium irradiated in the Jones Laboratory. Until reactors became available, minuscule amounts of plutonium were produced in the cyclotron at Washington University in St. Louis. The chemistry division worked with DuPont to develop the bismuth phosphate process used to separate plutonium from uranium.|$|E
5|$|Analogue filters {{have played}} an {{important}} part in the development of electronics. Especially in the field of telecommunications, filters have been of crucial importance in a number of technological breakthroughs and have been the source of enormous profits for telecommunications companies. It should come <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise,</b> therefore, that the early development of filters was intimately connected with transmission lines. Transmission line theory gave rise to filter theory, which initially took a very similar form, and the main application of filters was for use on telecommunication transmission lines. However, the arrival of network synthesis techniques greatly enhanced the degree of control of the designer.|$|E
5|$|Under severe {{pressure}} from his ministers {{to resolve this}} issue, Field travelled to England in March 1964 to pursue sovereign statehood, but returned empty-handed a month later. He resigned his position on 13 April; this came <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> to many government insiders, but appeared sudden to most sections of the general public. Smith promptly accepted the cabinet's invitation to take over, though he expressed surprise at the nomination. A farmer and erstwhile British Royal Air Force pilot from the rural town of Selukwe, Smith was Southern Rhodesia's first native-born head of government. He immediately promised to take a harder line on independence than his predecessor.|$|E

5|$|Fouroux was {{succeeded by}} Daniel Dubroca, who coached {{the team to}} the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Dubroca's tenure as coach did not last long, however, as he {{resigned}} after violently confronting referee David Bishop following France's World Cup quarter-final against England. Dubroca was replaced by Pierre Berbizier, who coached the team until after the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Berbizier's replacement, Jean-Claude Skrela, coached France to Five Nations Grand Slams in 1997 and 1998 before they came last in the tournament in 1999. He officially resigned following France's loss to Australia in the 1999 Rugby World Cup final. Bernard Laporte was appointed as Skrela's successor in November. Laporte guided France through the 2003 and 2007 Rugby World Cups before stepping down to become Secretary of State for Sport. After Philippe Saint-André turned down the offer to replace Laporte, French Rugby Federation president Bernard Lapasset appointed Marc Lièvremont to guide France to the 2011 World Cup. Lièvremont's tenure as coach was marked by inconsistent and puzzling squad selection choices, and player discontent. There were some bright moments, notably wins against New Zealand in Dunedin and South Africa in Toulouse, and the 2010 Six Nations Grand Slam. But {{there was also a}} 59–16 loss to Australia in Paris, a 22–21 loss to Italy in the 2011 Six Nations, and a 19–14 loss to Tonga during the 2011 World Cup. In August 2011, before the World Cup, it was announced that Philippe Saint-André would replace Lièvremont and guide France to the 2015 World Cup. This came <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> to Lièvremont, as he had announced as early as May 2010 that he would not continue as the coach of France after the World Cup.|$|E
25|$|Bearing this in mind, {{it should}} come <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that many subantarctic glaciers are also in retreat. Mass balance is {{significantly}} negative on many glaciers on Kergeulen Island, Heard Island, South Georgia and Bouvet Island.|$|E
25|$|Peck’s {{recommendation}} for a direct judgment against Noboa {{is likely to}} come <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise,</b> given the judge’s refusal last month to take up Noboa’s request to throw out NYKCool’s claims against him because his challenge came late in the game.|$|E
3000|$|Here {{the nature}} of smart city as {{ideology}} proper arises. It comes <b>as</b> a <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that the global contagion has been underpinned by the very agents of global capitalism, with, among others, IBM, Siemens and Cisco as prime promoters, as it is well documented by Adam Greenfield in his 2013 book Against the smart city (Greenfield 2013). This is something that shouldn’t be forgotten. As Greenfield lucidly puts it: [...]...|$|R

But principally: it's not maudlin; while MusicHeadQuarter writer Astrid Weist wrote: [...] "The album comes <b>as</b> <b>no</b> real <b>surprise</b> {{but is a}} {{bit more}} rocking in {{comparison}} with the No Angels' previous efforts. Altogether the musical direction is well-balanced. She gave Destiny seven out of nine stars.|$|R

Her world is turned upside down {{with the arrival of}} a group of RAF {{officers}} who requisition her family home as a base. She immediately falls for Bill Ogilvie with an old sports-car, then marries 'Splodge' but the life of an RAF pilot is a dangerous one as it comes <b>as</b> <b>no</b> real <b>surprise</b> when tragedy strikes.|$|R
25|$|In late January 2008, {{reports from}} {{anonymous}} U.S. officials indicated a U.S. spy satellite, later confirmed as USA-193, {{was in a}} deteriorating orbit and was expected to crash onto Earth within weeks.

25|$|In Taiwan, by contrast, the Hongmen is {{not only}} legal, but {{politically}} influential; this came <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise,</b> since Sun Yat-sen, founding father of the Republic of China, was a senior figure within the Hongmen, as was nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek. Moreover, the Kuomintang, or Chinese Nationalist Party, was formed from the Xingzhonghui and Guangfuhui, groups not unlike the Hongmen.|$|E
25|$|The Baathist coup of 8 February 1963 came <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> to the Communists, {{but they}} were unable to {{mobilize}} their supporters in the armed forces to oppose it effectively. Al-Radi reacted immediately by drawing up an appeal for mass resistance to the coup, and Communist supporters defended poorer districts of Baghdad against the new government until 10 February, suffering heavy losses.|$|E
60|$|I {{went into}} the village alone. Managing matters so <b>as</b> to excite <b>no</b> <b>surprise,</b> I {{contrived}} {{to have a little}} gossip about Nugent with Gootheridge at the inn, and with the servant at Browndown. If Nugent had returned secretly to Dimchurch, one of those two men, in our little village, must almost certainly have seen him. Neither of them had seen him.|$|R

However, data, which are standardized according to differences in population size and economic potential, reveal that Switzerland - compared to the other Continental European countries - exhibits a very high density of eminent economists. ...|$|R
40|$|Following a {{remarkable}} income year {{for most of}} Nebraska agriculture, it probably comes <b>as</b> <b>no</b> great <b>surprise</b> that agricultural land values rose sharply. Preliminary estimates for the year ending February 1, 2005 show the value of Nebraska farmland rising an average of 10. 9 percent. This was the largest annual percentage increase of the past 16 years. The increase itself represents a value of more than $ 4. 4 billion, and pushed the total estimated value of Nebraska’s agricultural real estate to nearly $ 45 billion...|$|R
25|$|Chorea {{is another}} {{condition}} which results from {{damage to the}} basal ganglia. Similar to athetosis, it results from mutations affecting the pallidum inhibition of the thalamus as well as increased dopaminergic activity {{at the level of}} the striatum. Considering the etiology of both disorders are fairly similar, it comes <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that chorea and athetosis can and usually do occur together in a condition called choreoathetosis.|$|E
25|$|William Malveisin was {{probably}} born in France. It {{is possible that}} {{he was the son of}} the nephew of the Count of Brittany, however it is much more likely that he came from a family of the name based on the lower Seine valley. William was likely the nephew of Samson de Malveisin, Archbishop of Rheims from 1140 to 1161. In this context, William's career can come <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise.</b>|$|E
25|$|From {{the point}} of view of Albert Einstein's theory, it comes <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that all {{attempts}} to treat gravity simply like one more quantum force (on par with electromagnetism and the nuclear forces) have failed. According to Einstein, gravity is not a force – it is a property of space-time itself. Loop quantum gravity is an attempt to develop a quantum theory of gravity based directly on Einstein's geometrical formulation.|$|E
25|$|Thus it came <b>as</b> <b>no</b> real <b>surprise</b> {{when his}} Man at the Crossroads became controversial, as it {{contained}} Moscow May Day scenes {{and a clear}} portrait of Lenin, not apparent in initial sketches. After Nelson issued a written warning to Rivera to replace the offending figure with an anonymous face, Rivera refused (after offering to counterbalance Lenin with a portrait of Lincoln), {{and so he was}} paid for his commission and the mural papered over at the instigation of Nelson, who was to become the Center's flamboyant president.|$|R
5000|$|In The Conduct of Inquiry: Methodology for Behavioral Science (1964), Kaplan again {{mentioned}} {{the law of}} the instrument saying, [...] "It comes <b>as</b> <b>no</b> particular <b>surprise</b> to discover that a scientist formulates problems in a way which requires for their solution just those techniques in which he himself is especially skilled." [...] And in a 1964 article for The Library Quarterly, he again cited the law and commented: [...] "We tend to formulate our problems {{in such a way as}} to make it seem that the solutions to those problems demand precisely what we already happen to have at hand." ...|$|R
40|$|We show that, {{since the}} {{inception}} of energy futures markets, prices have on average exhibited backwardation. Normal backwardation has also been the norm, but, because of the low power of the standard tests, most researchers have concluded that the unbiased expectations model cannot be rejected. The fact that backwardation has been and (though somewhat more weakly) continues to be prevalent makes MGRM?s strategy of hedging long-term supply commitments with short-dated futures contracts look somewhat better than previous observers have argued. That said, it should be re-stressed that their strategy was a highly speculative one and its unraveling should have come <b>as</b> <b>no</b> great <b>surprise.</b> [...] ...|$|R
25|$|Much {{the same}} way that the {{influential}} Duke Ellington matched his scores to the unique abilities of his performers, Hefti was able to take advantage of the same kind of 'fine-tuning' to bring out the best of the talents of the Basie band. Therefore, it should come <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that when the same charts are played by a different band, even the composer's own, that the result is not as strong.|$|E
25|$|To {{gain the}} passage of the Connecticut Plan its proponents needed support of three {{southern}} states, Georgia and the two Carolinas, complementing the small state coalition of the North. It came <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that Ellsworth favored the Three-Fifths Compromise on the enumeration of slaves and opposed the abolition of the foreign slave trade. Stressing that he had no slaves, Ellsworth spoke twice before the Convention, on August 21 and 22, in favor of slavery being abolished.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} of Irish immigrants in America {{has not always}} been harmonious. The US did not have a good relationship with most of the incoming Irish because of their Roman Catholic faith, as {{the majority of the population}} was Protestant and had been originally formed by offshoots of the Protestant faith, many of whom were from Northern Ireland (Ulster). So it came <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that the federal government issued new immigration acts, adding to previous ones which limited Eastern European immigration, ones which limited the immigration of the Irish.|$|E
40|$|Making a {{prediction}} is essentially expressing a belief about the future. It is therefore natural to interpret later predictions as revisions of earlier ones and {{to investigate the}} notion of belief revision in this context. We study, both semantically and syntactically, the following principle of minimum revision of prediction: “as long <b>as</b> there are <b>no</b> <b>surprises,</b> that is, <b>as</b> long as what actually occurs had been predicted to occur, then everything which was predicted in the past, if still possible, {{should continue to be}} predicted, and no new predictions should be added. ”...|$|R
40|$|The {{assumption}} that {{a solution to}} the Einstein equations is static (or stationary) very strongly constrains the asymptotic behaviour of the metric. It is shown that one need only impose very weak differentiability and decay conditions a priori on the metric for the field equations to force the metric to be analytic near infinity and to have the standard Schwarzschildian falloff. It has long been known that the asymptotically flat static and stationary solutions of the Einstein equations are analytic at spacelike infinity (Beig and Simon 1980, 1981). This should come <b>as</b> <b>no</b> real <b>surprise,</b> because they are the special solutions without gravitational radiation and so therefore the far-field should be dominated by the Newtonian potential(s) ...|$|R
40|$|To {{characterize}} {{patient satisfaction}} surveys, {{such as the}} U. S. government-mandated Press Ganey health care performance improvement tools, as unpopular among health care pro-viders is an understatement. So it comes <b>as</b> <b>no</b> real <b>surprise</b> that among medical practitioners a recent internet headline went viral that “reported ” that a major patient satisfaction study was stopped due to a mortality increase of 238 % in patients who received patient satisfaction scores. 1 Despite some pretty obvious pointers {{to the nature of}} this news flash —starting with the outrageous numbers presented, to the contributing author being a “Doktor Schnabel ” who quoted a “Prezz Gainey ” health care organization, which referred to a study sporting an acronym called PISS (Patient Improvement Satisfaction Study) —this posting went viral and prompted comments that vented on the many limitations of patien...|$|R
25|$|That the Drillers {{inflated}} their announced attendance came <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise,</b> {{as it is}} {{a common}} practice in pro sports, but part way through the season {{the degree to which the}} Drillers did became public and the numbers did not paint a rosy picture. It was exposed that while the club was announcing attendance in the 5,800 range, when the actual was only ~4,200. Coupled with even the announced figures falling far short of the previously stated 8,000 break even point, there were questions abound about how long Wojcicki could continue bankrolling the team.|$|E

Curbishley had been the odds-on favourite for the West Ham job straight after Pardew's departure, so it came <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise</b> that Curbishley was unveiled {{at a press conference}} on 13 December. Curbishley served as manager of local rivals Charlton for 15 years leading up to May 2006. During that time, he took Charlton from a struggling side languishing in old Second Division to a recognized Premiership side.|$|E

Colley was convinced that he had enough support to defeat the other likely candidate, Charles Haughey, and that Lynch should resign early to catch his opponents on the hop. Lynch agreed to this and resigned as leader of Fianna Fáil on 5 December 1979, assured that Colley had the votes necessary to win. However, Haughey and his supporters had been preparing for months {{to take over the}} leadership and Lynch's resignation came <b>as</b> <b>no</b> <b>surprise.</b> He narrowly defeated Colley in the leadership contest and succeeded Lynch as Taoiseach.|$|E

Yet Earley's style also takes root in reality, stemming from her own personal battle with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a rare genetic condition that affects the collagen holding one's body together.

60|$|A single blow of {{the massive}} {{glittering}} knocker brought a servant to the door. The promptitude with which this summons was answered showed that, notwithstanding the early hour, the Alderman was an expected guest.

Declining his invitation to enter, however, the Alderman placed his back against the iron railing of the stoop, and opened a discourse with the negro. The latter was aged, with a head that was grizzled, a nose that was levelled nearly to the plane of his face, features that were wrinkled and confused, and with a form which, though still solid, was bending with its load of years.|$|R
