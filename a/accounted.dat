30|$|Several studies {{focus on}} <b>accounting</b> {{identification}}, <b>accounting</b> measurement, and <b>accounting</b> policy. The basis of <b>accounting</b> identification is accrual <b>accounting,</b> butliterature raises {{the concept of}} cash flow based <b>accounting,</b> adjusted from cash based <b>accounting,</b> that could provide more useful information for decision making and solve the limitations of accrual based <b>accounting.</b> For <b>accounting</b> measurement, Lin (1997) investigates the relationship between uncertainty and <b>accounting</b> which argues that <b>accounting</b> has a time-lag and that uncertainty comes from monetary measurement. Xie (1997) presents two non-monetary asset measure models on the labor theory of value and marginal utility theory of value which {{are different from the}} capital preservation concept of <b>accounting.</b> Meanwhile, with the development of financial derivatives, Huang (1997 a) believes that historical cost <b>accounting</b> will be replaced by fair value <b>accounting</b> in the twenty-first century and briefly introduces the concept of fair value <b>accounting</b> in <b>accounting</b> standards issued by the Financial <b>Accounting</b> Standards Board (FASB). With respect to <b>accounting</b> policy, Huang and Yang (1995) explore questions such as what is <b>accounting</b> policy and why there is <b>accounting</b> policy. They regard <b>accounting</b> policy as the principle, procedure and method by which a certain <b>accounting</b> unit is used to make financial statements, including macro-level <b>accounting</b> policy such as <b>accounting</b> standards, and firm-level <b>accounting</b> policy issued by the firms themselves according to their particular situations. Consistent with Huang and Yang (1995), Li and Zhu (1996) argue that <b>accounting</b> environment and firm operation should be taken into consideration for the choice of <b>accounting</b> policy. As well, Huang and Yang (1996) investigate <b>accounting</b> policy in details, that is the separation between financial <b>accounting</b> and tax <b>accounting</b> in <b>accounting</b> policy. Financial <b>accounting</b> and tax <b>accounting</b> are separated due to different objectives, legislative authority and calculation principles. Compared with <b>accounting</b> development internationally, Tang and Lu (1997) put forward the challenge for financial <b>accounting</b> in China, including <b>accounting</b> identification, <b>accounting</b> measurement, financial reporting, <b>accounting</b> theory, the release and diffusion of <b>accounting</b> information, and the combination of financial <b>accounting</b> and managerial <b>accounting.</b>|$|R
