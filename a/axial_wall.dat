40|$|Papers {{presented}} to the 11 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 20 - 23 July 2015. A two-fluid, single-pass, counter-flow, cryogenic heat exchanger is investigated for the effect of ambient heat-in-leak to both the fluids and axial conduction in the wall separating the two fluids. In most cryogenics applications, the performance of heat exchangers deteriorates significantly due to heat-in-leak from the ambient and <b>axial</b> <b>wall</b> conduction. Here a small, counter-flow heat exchanger, of the type used in Joule-Thomson refrigerators, experiencing heat-in-leak to both hot & cold fluids, and <b>axial</b> <b>wall</b> conduction, is analyzed adopting the finite element method. Five non-dimensional parameters, including those to account for ambient heat-in-leak and <b>axial</b> <b>wall</b> conduction are defined to present the result. The effect of these parameters on the heat exchanger performance has been analyzed. The set of non-dimensional governing equations for hot fluid, cold fluid and the wall are obtained by energy balance. These governing equations are solved by FEM using Galerkin’s method. Validation is carried out {{by comparing the results}} obtained using the present methodology with those published in the literature for limited parameters. The excellent match between the two validates the solution methodology used. The effect of ambient heat-in-leak and <b>axial</b> <b>wall</b> conduction are studied for their effect on the fluid temperature profiles. Ambient heat-in-leak and <b>axial</b> <b>wall</b> conduction are found to increase the hot fluid exit temperature. The effect of <b>axial</b> <b>wall</b> conduction is found to be more concentrated towards the heat exchanger ends. Further, the effect of ambient heat-in-leak and <b>axial</b> <b>wall</b> conduction and varying non-dimensional parameters are studied for their effect on the hot fluid effectiveness and performance degradation.

New techniques of large-scale forcing (rotational oscillations of the cubic container) and detecting (monitoring ion transport along {{the axis of}} rotation) turbulence were implemented. Near the <b>axial</b> <b>walls,</b> with increasing forcing the vortex tangle grows without an observable threshold. This tangle gradually develops into bulk turbulence at a characteristic amplitude of forcing that depends on forcing frequency and rotation rate. At higher amplitudes, the total vortex line length increases rapidly. Resonances of inertial waves are observed in both laminar and turbulent bulk states.

40|$|The {{literature}} on the anatomy of root contraction is reviewed with special reference to recent work. This investigation, by light and electron microscopy, began with Hyacinth and was later extended to Gladiolus and Narcissus {{for the purpose of}} comparison with the findings of other workers. Contraction is the result of growth in the inner or middle cortex in which the cells extend radially and shorten axially, their variously orientated walls behaving differently. The horizontal walls are unusual in their structure. Even in uncontracted roots when potentially contractile, they resemble <b>axial</b> <b>walls</b> more than horizontal walls, in that the pit fields are orientated in relation to their potential for growth. In transverse sections of contracted roots, viewed by polarisation microscopy these walls appear as radially extended, highly birefringent thickened-plates with a crossed-fibrillar structure and with thin-areas, of very small birefringence, which become spaced further apart as radial growth and contraction proceed. Microfibrils in the thickened-plate fan out into the developing crossed-fibrillar framework of the radial walls. These walls extend radially and shorten axially. They also develop the marked crossed fibrillar structure already referred to, which results in the complete occlusion of their pit-fields. The middle lamellae between radial walls of adjacent cells break down, the older outer microfibrillar layers become torn and cohesion between adjacent cells is lost. The tangential walls show a passive wrinkling (ballooning) with points of adhesion in the region of pit-field areas. It is proposed that a mechanism of contraction based on these anatomical observations is brought about primarily by the radial extension of the horizontal walls and its concomitant effects on the <b>axial</b> <b>walls.</b> These observations and interpretations are discussed in relation to recent relevant work, in particular that of Sterling, who has proposed a different mechanism which seems to be quite incompatible with the anatomical facts. <p...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This {{in vitro}} study {{investigated}} {{the relationship between the}} cross-sectional area and the location of remaining coronal tooth structure and the fracture resistance of restored endodontically-treated teeth. Materials and Methods: Fifty-five extracted maxillary premolars received root canal treatment and crown preparation and were randomly divided into 11 groups of five teeth each according to the number and the site of the missing <b>axial</b> <b>wall(s).</b> Impressions of the prepared teeth were taken and poured with epoxy resin to construct a die for each tooth that was then sectioned 1 mm above the finish line. The surface area was measured using ImageJ software (version 1. 41 n. Developed by Wayne Rasband. National Institutes of Health, USA. 1 All 55 prepared teeth were then restored with composite resin cores, and cast metal crowns. Specimens were thermocycled between 5 °C and 55 °C for 500 cycles, prior to testing. A universal testing machine was used to apply a compressive load at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min to the palatal surface of the buccal cusp of the crown at an angle of 45 degrees to the long axis of the tooth until failure. Results were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and t-tests. Results: Specimens with all <b>axial</b> <b>walls</b> intact (only access cavity) had mean fracture strength of 1380. 5 ± 393. 9 N. Groups that have a missing palatal wall with one or two proximal walls showed the lowest mean failure loads of 398. 4 N ± 149. 5 N and 344. 7 N ± 91. 2 N respectively. The coefficient of determination (R²) between the surface area and the fracture resistance was 0. 52. Conclusions: For restored endodontically-treated upper premolars there is a positive linear relationship between the remaining dentine surface area and fracture strength. Residual dentine location influences the fracture resistance with the palatal wall having a major role in resisting force. Thesis (D. Clin.

This analysis {{has been carried out}} to understand the effect of <b>axial</b> <b>wall</b> conduction for simultaneously developing laminar flow and heat transfer in a circular microtube subjected to constant wall temperature boundary condition imposed on its outer surface. In this background, we have considered for four most practical cases of partial heating of microtubes: (i) the outer surface of the microtube is subjected to constant wall temperature over its full length (ii) 10 % of total length at both the inlet and the outlet end are insulated while the remaining length is subjected to constant wall temperature boundary condition (iii) 10 % of total length at inlet is insulated while the remaining length is subjected to constant wall temperature boundary condition (iv) 10 % of total length at outlet is insulated while the remaining length is subjected to constant wall temperature boundary condition. Simulations have been carried out {{for a wide range of}} pipe wall to fluid conductivity ratio (ksf: 2 - 646), pipe wall thickness to inner radius ratio (äsf: 1, 10), and flow Re (100 - 500). For partial heated microtube it is found that the average Nusselt number (Nuavg) is increasing with decreasing ksf. At very low ksf it is found that for smaller äsf, (Nuavg) again starts decreasing, but at higher ksf it continues to increase. This is due to absence of <b>axial</b> <b>wall</b> conduction and lower total heating length. But at higher ksf the effective heating length increases due to <b>axial</b> <b>wall</b> conduction. Overall, at higher äsf, the trend is same as full heating case because of <b>axial</b> <b>wall</b> conduction at both the inlet and the outlet ends due to the thick solid wall...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background A recent model {{describing}} the mechanical interaction between a stenosis and the vessel wall {{has shown that}} <b>axial</b> <b>wall</b> stress can considerably increase in the region immediately proximal to the stenosis during the (forward) flow phases, so that abnormal biological processes and wall damages {{are likely to be}} induced in that region. Our objective was to examine what this model predicts when applied to myocardial bridges. Method The model was adapted to the hemodynamic particularities of myocardial bridges and used to estimate by means of a numerical example the cyclic increase in <b>axial</b> <b>wall</b> stress in the vessel segment proximal to the bridge. The consistence of the results with reported observations on the presence of atheroma in the proximal, tunneled, and distal vessel segments of bridged coronary arteries was also examined. Results 1) <b>Axial</b> <b>wall</b> stress can markedly increase in the entrance region of the bridge during the cardiac cycle. 2) This is consistent with reported observations showing that this region is particularly prone to atherosclerosis. Conclusion The proposed mechanical explanation of atherosclerosis in bridged coronary arteries indicates that angioplasty and other similar interventions will not stop the development of atherosclerosis at the bridge entrance and in the proximal epicardial segment if the decrease of the lumen of the tunneled segment during systole is not considerably reduced. </p...|$|E

40|$|Axial valleys {{are found}} along most slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges and {{are one of}} the most {{prominent}} topographic features on Earth. In this paper, we present the first deep-tow swath bathymetry for the <b>axial</b> valley <b>walls</b> of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These data allow us to analyze <b>axial</b> valley <b>wall</b> morphology with a very high resolution (0. 5 to 1 m compared to 50 m for shipboard multibeam bathymetry), revealing the role played by landslides. Slow-spreading ridge axial valleys also commonly expose mantle-derived serpentinized peridotites in the footwalls of large offset normal faults (detachments). In our map of the Ashadze area (lat. 13 degrees N), ultramafic outcrops have an average slope of 18 degrees and behave as sliding deformable rock masses, with little fragmentation. By contrast, the basaltic seafloor in the Krasnov area (lat. 16 degrees 38 N) has an average slope of 32 degrees and the erosion of the steep basaltic rock faces leads to extensive fragmentation, forming debris with morphologies consistent with noncohesive granular flow. Comparison with laboratory experiments suggests that the repose angle for this basaltic debris is > 25 degrees. We discuss the interplay between the normal faults that bound the axial valley and the observed mass wasting processes. We propose that, along <b>axial</b> valley <b>walls</b> where serpentinized peridotites are exposed by detachment faults, mass wasting results in average slopes 20 degrees, even in places where the emergence angle of the detachment is larger...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the thermal safety of Er:YAG and Er,Cr:YSGG lasers with {{conventional}} multi-use and single-use diamond burs. BACKGROUND DATA: Thermal effect of tooth preparation is mostly evaluated through the pulp chamber because it is difficult to measure the temperature of the preparation surface. A new in vitro method was introduced to simultaneously evaluate the heat increase of the preparation surface together with the pulp chamber. METHODS: Six laser and bur instrument groups were used to make standardized preparations on buccal surfaces of 60 intact third molars. The preparations removed an equal volume of hard tissue from each tooth (4 mm occluso-gingival x 8 mm mesial-distal x 1. 6 mm bucco-lingual). The teeth also included tunnel preparations from the opposite (lingual) surface, exposing the pulpal <b>axial</b> <b>wall</b> (axial dentin wall in contact with the pulp chamber from the preparation surface site). An infrared thermal camera was positioned to capture the preparation surface in direct vision, while the pulpal <b>axial</b> <b>wall</b> was indirectly reflected to the thermal camera via a minimal-energy-loss mirror. Data from both surfaces were analyzed statistically using Nested Least Squares Analysis. RESULTS: The laser groups generated significantly lower heat compared to bur groups on the preparation surfaces. In contrast, both lasers generated greater pulpal heat increase, and the Er:YAG laser group showed significance (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: Lasers produced less heat on the preparation surface but more on the pulpal <b>axial</b> <b>wall.</b> However the temperature rise was less than the 5. 5 degrees C threshold margin of safety...|$|E

40|$|Context: The {{design of}} the class V cavity {{presents}} a clinical challenge {{in the field of}} adhesive dentistry as the margin placement is partially in enamel and partly in dentin, and the trouble associated with this design is the microleakage at the dentinal margin. When these restorations undergo microabrasion due to cosmetic reasons, this trouble aggravates to the significant levels. Aims: The aim of this study was the measurement of microleakage of class V glass ionomer restorations over two different periods of enamel microabrasion. Settings and Design: This in vitro experimental study was conducted on 120 class V cavities which had been prepared on the buccal and lingual surfaces of 60 sound human premolars. One-half of the cavities were restored with the resin-modified glass ionomer cement (GIC) (60 cavities) and another half with the compomer (60 cavities). Finishing and polishing were performed. Subjects and Methods: Then, the teeth were classified into six groups (n = 20). Microabrasion treatment was performed with Opaluster (Ultradent Product Inc., South Jordan, UT, USA) for 0 (control no treatment), 60 and 120 s. Then, teeth were thermocycled between 5 °C and 55 °C, immersed in rhodamine B solution (24 h), and sectioned longitudinally in buccolingual direction. Dye penetration was examined with stereomicroscope (× 10). Microleakage scores were statistically analyzed. The mean occlusal margin scores and gingival margin scores were compared between all the groups using the Kruskal–Wallis test, Mann–Whitney U-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and post hoc comparison. There was a significant difference between Group 1 a, Group 2 a, Group 1 b, Group 2 b, Group 1 c, and Group 2 c. Statistical Analysis Used: Statistical analysis used in this study was Kruskal–Wallis test, Mann–Whitney U-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and post hoc comparison. Results: The least microleakage scores were observed in occlusal margins of control groups (without microabrasion). Moreover, in both restorations, the microleakage scores in occlusal margins were higher than gingival margins, and compoglass had less microleakage in occlusal and occlusal plus <b>axial</b> <b>walls</b> of class V cavities compared with resin-modified GIC.

A microchannel of inner width and height are 0. 4 × 0. 4 mm 2 and length of 30 mm is considered for the numerical simulation. The wavelength and amplitude of the vertical wavy shaped channel wall are 12 mm and 0. 2 mm respectively. The working fluid is taken as water which enters the channel at 300 K temperature and constant heat flux boundary condition is imposed on the entire bottom surface of the microchannel. All the remaining walls of the microchannel exposed to surrounding are kept insulated. The velocity at the inlet of channel is {{the combination of a}} fixed component of velocity and fluctuating component of velocity which varies sinusoidally, thus causing pulsatile velocity at the inlet (amplitude, A = 0. 2) with variation of frequency from 2 Hz to 10 Hz. Simulations has been performed for constant flow Reynolds number (Re = 100) and wall thickness to inner radius ratio (δsf = 1) with varrying solid wall to fluid conductivity ratio (ksf from 0. 344 to 715).

The simulations have been carried out by varying wall thickness to channel height ratio (dsf ~ 1 - 24), solid substrate conductivity to working fluid conductivity ratio (ksf ~ 0. 17 - 703) and Reynolds number (Re~ 100 - 1000).

On the whole 72 castings were constructed, which incorporated an attachment to allow removal. Castings were cemented to abutments with TempBond®. A uniaxial tensile force was applied to the crown using an Instron machine until cement failure occurred. Analysis of variance of the models were fit to determine the effect of height of abutment of the restorations on the mean tensile strength (α= 0. 05). Results. The mean peak removal force for corresponding abutments was significantly different (P NP; (2) with alteration of <b>axial</b> <b>wall</b> height for NP: 5 mm > 4 mm > 3 mm = 2 mm and for WP: 5 mm > 4 mm = 3 mm = 2 mm. Conclusion. The retention of NP cement-retained restorations is influenced by the wall height but not in same manner as WP. Restorations of narrow-platform size with longer abutment exhibited higher tensile resistance to dislodgement...|$|E

With the correct ratio of nozzle throat area to rotor effective throat area, the design specific work was obtained near the peak efficiency. From the results of the investigation it was concluded that the convex in sweep of the rotor inner wall and high degree of blade taper caused the turbine configuration to have two aerodynamic disadvantages in comparison with a turbine configuration with an <b>axial</b> inner <b>wall</b> at the rotor outlet and little axial taper...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} study {{was performed to}} assess the influence of beveling the margins of cavities and the effects on marginal adaptation of the application of ultrasound during setting and initial light curing. After minimal access cavities had been prepared with an 80 microm diamond bur, 80 box-only Class II cavities were prepared mesially and distally in 40 extracted human molars using four different oscillating diamond coated instruments: (A) a U-shaped PCS insert as the non-beveled control (EMS), (B) Bevelshape (Intensiv), (C) SonicSys (KaVo) and (D) SuperPrep (KaVo). In groups B-D, the time taken for additional bevel finishing was measured. The cavities were filled with a hybrid composite material in three increments. Ultrasound was also applied to one cavity per tooth before and during initial light curing (10 seconds). The specimens were subjected to thermomechanical stress in a computer-controlled masticator device. Marginal quality was assessed by scanning electron microscopy {{and the results were}} compared statistically. The additional time required for finishing was B > D > C (p < or = 0. 05). In all groups, thermomechanical loading resulted in a decrease in marginal quality. Beveling resulted in higher values for "continuous" margins compared with that of the unbeveled controls. The latter showed better marginal quality at the <b>axial</b> <b>walls</b> when ultrasound was used. Beveling seems essential for good marginal adaptation but requires more preparation time. The use of ultrasonic vibrations may improve the marginal quality of unbeveled fillings and warrants further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. To {{evaluate}} interfacial nanoleakage {{expression of}} the combination of different cementation procedures and different crown systems. Methods. Forty-five human premolars prepared to receive single crowns were randomly divided into three groups (n = 15) based on the materials {{to be used for}} crown fabrication and cementation: group 1 : Zirc (Ivoclar-Vivadent) cemented with Multilink Automix; group 2 : Ivoclar disilicate IPS Empress 2 luted with Excite DSC in combination with Variolink II; group 3 : AAdva Zirconia (GC) cemented with G-Cem Automix. The specimens were then assessed for interfacial nanoleakage expression and the amount of silver deposits along the interface was quantified. The thickness of the cement was assessed at 5 different levels: cervical margins, midway between the cervical margin and the occlusal <b>wall</b> along the <b>axial</b> <b>walls</b> and at the occlusal wall. The nanoleakage scores and the cement thickness were analyzed with Kruskall–Wallis non-parametric Analysis of Variance and Dunn’s Multiple-range post hoc test. Results.

There was no correlation among combination of different cementation procedures and different crown systems and interfacial nanoleakage. Also the cement thickness and the degree of nanoleakage cannot be related.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{conjugate}} heat transfer, vapor compressibility, and viscous dissipation in heat pipes are discussed. The {{accuracy of the}} partially parabolic versus the elliptic presentation of the governing equations is also examined. The {{results show that the}} <b>axial</b> <b>wall</b> conduction has a tendency to make the temperature distribution more uniform for heat pipes with large ratios of pipe wall to effective liquid-wick thermal conductivity. The compressible and incompressible models show very close agreement for the total pressure drop, while the local pressure variations along the heat pipe are quite different for these two models when the radial Reynolds number at the interface is high...|$|E
40|$|The {{heating rate}} and {{pressure}} distributions {{in and around}} the elevon coves were correlated. An analytical approach incorporating such a correlation into a thermal structure computer code to examine the elevon seal and cover structure in flight was developed. Emphasis was placed on the design of a thermal model that predicts gas and wall temperatures in the cove area. The elevon cove area was modelled analytically by a parallel plate flow channel, incorporating effects of <b>axial</b> <b>wall</b> conduction, axial and environmental radiant energy exchanges, and effects of laminar and turbulent convection entrance regions. Comparisons were made between computed and measured values of (1) cove wall temperatures; (2) local gas temperature within the cove; and (3) local heating rates...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the Knoop hardness number (KHN) of dentin and the microtensile bond strength (mu TBS) at different walls of MOD preparations, and the correlation between mu TBS and the KHN of dentin. Materials and Methods: Human molars with MOD preparations were allocated into 3 groups according to the preparation wall (axial, gingival, pulpal). Each tooth was sectioned into halves, resulting in two similar preparation walls: one was used for measuring the KHN of dentin and the other for mu TBS testing. Flat surfaces of the respective walls were obtained by cutting away adjacent walls. For the KHN measurement, twelve indentations were performed along the preparation wall (50 g/ 15 s). For mu TBS testing, specimens were distributed into 3 groups according to the adhesive system (Adper Single Bond Plus/SB, Clearfil SE Bond/SE, Adper Prompt/AP). Composite blocks were built over surfaces; specimens were sectioned (3 slabs/wall) and trimmed to an hourglass shape (1 mm(2)). Results: The KHN of dentin walls was significantly different (ANOVA/Tukey); pulpal wall > <b>axial</b> <b>wall</b> > gingival wall. The effect of preparation walls on mu TBS was dependent on the bonding system (2 -way ANOVA/Tukey's test). SB had higher bond strength than the other systems at the gingival wall; and higher than SE at the <b>axial</b> <b>wall.</b> At the pulpal wall, SE presented a higher mean compared to AP. A significant negative correlation between mu TBS and KHN was observed at the gingival wall. Conclusion: It could be concluded that dentin structure can affect bond strengths, but the impact of the substrate varies according to the type of adhesive system...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of coping designs on the stress distributions in posterior zirconia crowns by non-linear three-dimensional finite element analysis. Three-dimensional finite element models of a mandibular right first molar with layers of veneering porcelain, zirconia coping, cement, and abutment tooth were designed by computer software (HyperWorks 10. 0). Ten zirconia crowns with different designs were produced according to various shoulder positions and heights. The shoulders (1 -mm width) exhibited incremental height increases of 1 mm, 2 mm, and 3 mm on the buccal, lingual, and proximal sides, respectively. An axial compressive dynamic load simulating the progressive load was applied until a stainless steel ball model (7 mm in diameter) deepened the veneer surface to 0. 7 mm in depth. Loads were placed on the inner inclines of the mesiobuccal, distobuccal, and mesiolingual cusps. Residual maximum principal stresses (MPSs) at the veneer and coping under progressive loading were determined for each zirconia crown. Reinforcements with the shoulders on the buccal, lingual, and proximal <b>axial</b> <b>walls</b> resulted in lower MPSs in the veneering porcelain but higher MPSs in the zirconia coping. As the shoulder height increased, the tensile stresses decreased, while the compressive stresses increased in the veneering porcelains. It can be concluded that the shoulder height and position in the zirconia coping will affect the MPSs of the crown. Our findings conclusively reveal the critical role of the shoulder design of the coping in preventing veneer fracture on posterior zirconia restorations by reducing tensile stresses in veneering porcelain...|$|R
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} and compare the marginal and internal fit in vitro of three-unit FDPs in Co-Cr made using four fabrication techniques, and to conclude in which area the largest misfit is present. METHODS: An epoxy resin master model was produced. The impression was first made with silicone, and master and working models were then produced. A total of 32 three-unit Co-Cr FDPs were fabricated with four different production techniques: conventional lost-wax method (LW), milled wax with lost-wax method (MW), milled Co-Cr (MC), and direct laser metal sintering (DLMS). Each of the four groups consisted of eight FDPs (test groups). The FDPs were cemented on their cast and standardised-sectioned. The cement film thickness of the marginal and internal gaps was measured in a stereomicroscope, digital photos were taken at 12 × magnification and then analyzed using measurement software. Statistical analyses were performed with one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test. RESULTS: Best fit based on the means (SDs) in μm for all measurement points was in the DLMS group 84 (60) followed by MW 117 (89), LW 133 (89) and MC 166 (135). Significant differences were present between MC and DLMS (p< 0. 05). The regression analyses presented differences within the parameters: production technique, tooth size, position and measurement point (p< 0. 05). SIGNIFICANCE: Best fit {{was found in the}} DLMS group followed by MW, LW and MC. In all four groups, best fit in both abutments was along the <b>axial</b> <b>walls</b> and in the deepest part of the chamfer preparation. The greatest misfit was present occlusally in all specimens...|$|R
