30|$|Finding {{polarity}} <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> automatically in a corpus is not easy. The {{density of}} polarity shifting is normally low, and <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> are subtle and flexible, making {{the task of}} extracting polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> difficult. Currently, human annotating is the main way to obtain polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns,</b> which is time-consuming. This paper will present a semi-automatic approach to extracting polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> from specially designed corpora. This approach used sequence mining to generate frequent word sequences, which greatly reduced human labor in annotating polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> compared with annotating the original corpus directly.|$|R

30|$|However, a contextual word made {{it harder}} to find a {{polarity}} <b>shifting</b> <b>pattern.</b> For example, 大 da “big” is a contextual polar word. If it is classified as a positive word, then it should fail in helping to find a polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>pattern.</b> For example, 噪声很大 zaosheng hen da “the noise is very big” is a bad comment, but 很X hen X “very X” is not a polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>pattern.</b> For this reason, we did not include contextual polar words in the three experiments in this study.|$|R
30|$|This work {{offered a}} rough {{distribution}} of polarity shifting in the corpora and some typical polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns.</b> However, for a practical system, the patterns manually extracted from only 100 sentences are not enough. Our work aimed to extract more polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> from massive text corpora.|$|R

30|$|Polarity {{shifting}} is {{a phenomenon}} in sentiment analysis that denotes the inversion, attenuation, or cancelation of the sentiment of a polarity clue (i.e., word or phrase) in a sentence. A polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>pattern</b> is a pattern that performs polarity shifting. Previous {{research has shown that}} the detection of polarity shifting can improve the performance of sentiment analysis. Currently, researchers often manually check a corpus line by line to find sentences containing polarity shifting and then extract the polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>pattern.</b> However, this process is time-consuming and may miss many polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the multi-variate sequence classification problem from a multi-instance learning perspective. Real-world sequential data commonly show discriminative patterns only at specific time periods. For instance, {{we can identify}} a cropland during its growing season, but it looks similar to a barren land after harvest or before planting. Besides, even within the same class, the discriminative patterns can appear in different periods of sequential data. Due to such property, these discriminative patterns are {{also referred to as}} <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns.</b> The <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> in sequential data severely degrade the performance of traditional classification methods without sufficient training data. We propose a novel sequence classification method by automatically mining <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> from multi-variate sequence. The method employs a multi-instance learning approach to detect <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> while also modeling temporal relationships within each multi-instance bag by an LSTM model to further improve the classification performance. We extensively evaluate our method on two real-world applications - cropland mapping and affective state recognition. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in sequence classification performance and in detecting discriminative <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} is descriptive qualitative research. The {{objectives of the}} research are to identify the translation shift of noun phrase and to describe the <b>shift</b> <b>pattern</b> of noun phrase translation in The Journey 2 Movie subtitle. The data are noun phrases found in The Journey 2 Movie subtitle. The researcher uses documentation as the method of collecting the data. The result of the {{research is}} from 334 data, there are 136 data belong to translation shift of noun phrase. The researcher finds two types of translation shift, they are level shift and structure shift. Level shift of noun phrase is divided into five parts, the first is noun phrase that is translated into clause, the <b>shift</b> <b>pattern</b> which occurs in this translation is from phrase changes into clause. Secondly, noun phrase is translated into noun, the <b>shift</b> <b>pattern</b> is from phrase changes into word or noun. The third is noun phrase that is translated into adjective, the <b>shift</b> <b>pattern</b> in this translation is from phrase changes into word or adjective. The fourth is noun phrase is translated into verb, the <b>shift</b> <b>pattern</b> which occurs is from phrase into word or verb. And the last is noun phrase that is translated into adverb, its <b>shift</b> <b>pattern</b> is from phrase changes into word or adverb. Then structural shift contains three parts, noun phrase is translated into adjective phrase, noun phrase is translated into verb phrase and noun phrase is translated into prepositional phrase. The <b>shift</b> <b>pattern</b> of this third translation shift is from phrase changes into phrase...|$|R

30|$|The most {{important}} finding in experiment III {{is that the}} experiment did not need star rating information, which is sometimes hard to obtain. Therefore, we can apply our approach to almost unlimited raw corpora {{as long as a}} polarity lexicon is constructed. Although some classes (especially doubt) of polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> were not abundant in this experiment, it did provide most of the polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns.</b>|$|R
30|$|In {{sentiment}} analysis, polarity shifting means {{shifting the}} polarity of a sentiment clue that expresses emotion, evaluation, etc. Compared with other {{natural language processing}} (NLP) tasks, extracting polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> from corpora is a challenging one because the methods used to shift polarity are flexible, which often invalidates fully automatic approaches. In this study, which aimed to extract polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> that inverted, attenuated, or canceled polarity, we used a semi-automatic approach based on sequence mining. This approach greatly reduced the cost of human annotating, while covering as many frequent polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> as possible. We tested this approach on different domain corpora and in different settings. Three types of experiments were performed and the experimental results were analyzed, which will be reported in this paper.|$|R
30|$|After {{obtaining a}} set of prior {{positive}} clues, we used it to find text lines that contained at least one positive clue. The reason for performing this step was to obtain texts in which polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> were dense. Of course, one could skip the steps described in Section  2.3 and in this section and directly annotate polarity shifting in any given corpus. However, according to our experience, the possibility that annotators will detect polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> in an arbitrary unlabeled corpus is quite low. Therefore, to obtain a specified corpus where polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> occur frequently, this experiment used bad comments {{with at least one}} positive clue, assuming that polarity shifting inverted or attenuated the polarity of the positive clue.|$|R

Recent work on polarity shifting has mainly pursued {{two of the}} three classes, namely, inverters and attenuators. In our study, we also limited our research to these two classes of polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns.</b>|$|R

30|$|As {{can be seen}} in Table  9, {{there are}} no {{polarity}} <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns</b> in the doubt class 9. Suppose a negative clue is shifted by a “doubt” <b>shifting</b> <b>pattern</b> and a positive clue follows, the positive clue seems an answer to the doubt, which is like answering one’s own question. Such baffling expressions are rare in the literature. In contrast, there are many patterns in the comparison and transition classes. Since this experiment required that sentences include both a positive clue and a negative clue to qualify as having polarity <b>shifting</b> <b>patterns,</b> {{it is not difficult to}} understand why there were so many instances found in these two classes. This is a similar case for the negation class, as speakers can easily negate a polar clue and put it with a clue of opposite polarity, which is quite common in informal texts.|$|R
