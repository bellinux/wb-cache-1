500|$|Brundage married Elizabeth Dunlap, {{daughter}} of a Chicago banker, in 1927, when he was 40. Elizabeth Brundage, three years younger than her husband, was a trained soprano, a talent she exhibited for visitors to the Brundage home. She had {{a strong interest in}} classical music, one which may not have been fully shared by her husband, who said of a performance of Wagner's Die Walküre that it [...] "started at 7o'clock, at 10:00pm I looked <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> and it registered exactly 8o'clock". She died at age 81 in 1971.|$|E
60|$|I looked <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It was six o'clock. I {{determined}} to lose no time.|$|E
60|$|An {{interval}} elapsed--long or short, I cannot say which; I was {{too much}} excited to look <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> All I know is that I discovered her! She crossed the yard, after waiting {{to make sure that}} no one was there to see her; and she entered the stable by the door which led to that part of the building occupied by Michael. This time I looked <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|E
60|$|When I woke {{up again}} {{it was to}} find the Lady Yva seated <b>at</b> <b>my</b> side <b>watching</b> me.|$|R
6000|$|... "By George, Miles," [...] Marble said, as {{he stood}} <b>at</b> <b>my</b> side, <b>watching</b> the {{movements}} of the stranger, [...] "that second frigate is the Speedy! I know her by the billet, and the distance of her bridle-port from her head. You never saw such a space for anchors, before! Then, you may see she is a six-and-thirty, with white hammock-cloths. Who ever saw that twice, at sea?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{happen to}} know, and unluckily did it happen, the very {{minute of the}} hour when we left Blocksby's. It was a quarter to four o'clock--a church- tower was chiming the three-quarters in the Strand, and I looked half {{mechanically}} <b>at</b> <b>my</b> own <b>watch,</b> which was five minutes fast. On Sunday I went down to Oxford, and happened to walk into Allen's rooms. He was lying on a sofa reading the [...] "Spectator." [...] After chatting a little, I said, [...] "You took no notice of me, nor of the Bretons yesterday, Allen, at Blocksby's." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{lapsed into}} silence. The train rolled on. I looked <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> London {{was not far}} off now.|$|E
60|$|Ah! He, of course, would know. I looked <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It {{was twenty}} minutes past nine only.... Still.|$|E
60|$|I looked <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> Yes, {{five hours}} had been {{gathered}} {{in by the}} grim scytheman. I went to dinner.|$|E
6000|$|... "For sure," [...] she answered—and then, {{laying the}} books on the table, [...] "I know how a man will {{compliment}} me {{by the way he}} looks at me"—she kneeled before the fire. [...] "Some look <b>at</b> <b>my</b> hair, some <b>watch</b> {{the rise and fall of}} my breathing, some look <b>at</b> <b>my</b> neck, and a few,—not you among them,—look me in the eyes for my thoughts. To you, I'm a fine specimen, strong! Pretty strong! You primitive man!" ...|$|R
6000|$|So my {{eyes fixed}} on that patch of yellow sand <b>at</b> <b>my</b> feet, <b>watching</b> how the small {{particles}} glinted like diamond dust when the sunlight touched them. A full hour passed in this way, during which I encouraged myself by saying mentally: [...] "This is a contest between us, and the most patient and the strongest of will, which should be the man, must conquer. And if I win on this occasion, {{it will be easier}} for me in the future--easier to discover those things which I am resolved to know, and the girl must reveal to me, since the old man has proved impracticable." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>At</b> last (<b>my</b> <b>watch</b> {{showed that}} it was one in the morning) I saw the gleam of water amid the {{openings}} of the jungle, and ten minutes later I was among the reeds upon the borders of the central lake. I was exceedingly dry, so I lay down and took a long draught of its waters, which were fresh and cold. There was a broad pathway with many tracks upon it at the spot which I had found, so that it was clearly one of the drinking-places of the animals. Close to the water's edge there was a huge isolated block of lava. Up this I climbed, and, lying on the top, I had an excellent view in every direction.|$|R
60|$|Perfectly {{clear it}} was, {{perfectly}} clear, and why hadn't I seen it before?... I looked <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch,</b> {{and it was}} half-past two.|$|E
6000|$|I glanced with consternation <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> [...] "Why didn't one of {{the others}} waken me? Do you know it's ten o'clock, Sally?" [...] I asked.|$|E
60|$|I {{had just}} looked <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch,</b> making {{out in the}} starlight that the hour was eleven, when the report of a gun broke the silence.|$|E
60|$|For {{seventeen}} years we were together; for {{seventeen years}} he was <b>at</b> <b>my</b> shoulder, <b>watching</b> while I slept, nursing me through fever and wounds--ay, and receiving wounds in fighting for me. He signed on the same ships with me; and together we ranged the Pacific from Hawaii to Sydney Head, and from Torres Straits to the Galapagos. We blackbirded from the New Hebrides and the Line Islands over to the westward clear through the Louisades, New Britain, New Ireland, and New Hanover. We were wrecked three times--in the Gilberts, in the Santa Cruz group, and in the Fijis. And we traded and salved wherever a dollar promised {{in the way of}} pearl and pearl shell, copra, beche-de-mer, hawkbill turtle shell, and stranded wrecks.|$|R
60|$|Truly this {{stranger}} was making life very interesting, {{even if he}} was only prodding over its dead moles. And truly I was an incorrigibly romantic young lady; for when, with a glance <b>at</b> <b>my</b> grandfather's <b>watch,</b> I discovered that it was long past noon, and told him I must be gone; without a single moment's hesitation, I promised to come again to meet him on the very first fine morning that showed. So strong within me was the desire to do so, that a profound dismay chilled my mind when, on turning about {{at the end of the}} terrace--for he had shown no inclination to accompany me--I found that he was already out of sight. I formally waved my hand towards where he had vanished in case he should be watching; sighed, and went on.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} {{of the success of the}} campaign, several other {{companies}} followed suit with nostalgia-themed campaigns of their own, with mixed results. Particularly singled out for derision were campaigns by Persil and Sainsbury's, with Leon Jaume of WCRS commenting on the latter in Campaign magazine: [...] "This is meagre fare, frankly, and allows the blogsters to concentrate on the elephant on the bacon counter: that the ad doesn't so much nod to the recent Hovis epic as pick a fight with it, shouting: 'I've got decades of British history, me! Hear my tinkling piano track! Look <b>at</b> <b>my</b> loveable urchin! <b>Watch</b> <b>my</b> wartime reconstruction!' The bloggers are less than whelmed by the similarities, and I feel the uncomfortable frisson of kinship with them." ...|$|R
60|$|I looked <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It wanted {{five minutes}} to twelve, when the premonitory {{symptoms}} of the working of the laudanum first showed themselves to me.|$|E
6000|$|I looked <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It {{was past}} three o'clock--quite the full swing of {{afternoon}} office {{work in the}} port. He snarled imperiously: [...] "Sit down, Captain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} look <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> upon no such matter," [...] said the Captain; [...] "nor will I any way be {{disposed}} to doubt your friend's honour, Mr. Winterblossom." ...|$|E
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 There 2 ̆ 7 s {{something}} about an upstairs window that always intrigued me. When I was growing up, my bedroom was a converted attic and I would sit <b>at</b> <b>my</b> window and <b>watch</b> the world below me. Voices would drift {{up from the}} street. I would see the people [...] friends and strangers alike [...] walk by, living life each in their own unique way. And I would observe silently, unobtrusively taking it all in. 2 ̆...|$|R
60|$|I sat up {{suddenly}} {{in bed and}} turned on the light. It was barely two o'clock by <b>my</b> <b>watch,</b> but I felt sure that I had not been mistaken. Some one had knocked <b>at</b> <b>my</b> door.|$|R
5000|$|Lacy {{went on to}} star in {{a number}} of short films such as Titsiana Booberini which she co-wrote. The film {{received}} much international acclaim, scoring the director, Robert Luketic, a three-picture deal. She also wrote and starred in Pussy Got Your Tongue? which won her the Nicole Kidman Best Actress award at Tropfest in 1997. Later that year she starred with Ben Mendlesohn in Tangerine Dream, winning the Best Actress Award <b>at</b> the <b>Watch</b> <b>My</b> Shorts Festival.|$|R
60|$|I {{had just}} stopped to look <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch,</b> when I saw {{something}} dark floating towards me, urged by the slow current of the river. As it came nearer, I thought I recognized the mill-boat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! to-night! Let me see. Ah! I just glanced <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch,</b> {{saw that}} I {{had already been}} out just three minutes over the precise half-hour, decided there was not time to go round, turned--" ...|$|E
60|$|Searle {{received}} this broadside gaping. Then turning away {{he went and}} seated himself on a bench {{against the wall and}} rubbed his forehead amazedly. I looked <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> and listened for the wheels of our carriage.|$|E
6000|$|He sat a {{few moments}} looking at me. It was getting dark in the wood. Then he took up an ebony stick with a gold head, and rose. The stick seemed to catch <b>at</b> <b>my</b> imagination. I <b>watched</b> it curiously as we walked {{with the old man}} along the path to the gate. We went with him into the open road. When we reached the clear sky where the light from the west fell full on our faces, he turned again and looked at us closely. His mouth opened sharply, as if he would speak, but he stopped himself, and only said [...] "Good-bye—Good-bye." ...|$|R
40|$|As {{the title}} suggests, {{this is a}} paper trying {{to do two things}} at once. I want to start a {{conversation}} about what an anthropology of reading could look like, and although I will make particular reference to the role of Bible reading in the lives of Christians, I am interested more generally in the role of reading in people’s lives. This leads me onto the question: what kind of methods do we need to use in order to understand reading? As an ethnographer, I have various tools <b>at</b> <b>my</b> disposal: <b>watching,</b> participating, conversing, interviewing, etc. Are these tools sufficient for the understanding of a practice like reading? In order to deepen my understanding of what people do when they read, I have turned to a new research tool, eye-tracking, and in order to use this tool, I am working within an experimental framework. This leads me onto the second goal of my paper: I want prompt a discussion on whether an anthropologist has any business messing around with equipment like eye-trackers, and, beyond this, whether the experimental method has a place in contemporary anthropology.

6000|$|Being {{forbidden}} to meddle with fleshly arms and legs, I solaced myself by mending cotton ones, and, as I sat sewing <b>at</b> <b>my</b> window, <b>watched</b> the moving panorama that passed below; amusing myself with taking {{notes of the}} most striking figures in it. Long trains of army wagons kept up a perpetual rumble from morning till night; ambulances rattled to and fro with busy surgeons, nurses taking an airing, or convalescents going in parties to be fitted to artificial limbs. Strings of sorry looking horses passed, saying as plainly as dumb creatures could, [...] "Why, in a city full of them, is there no horsepital for us?" [...] Often a cart came by, with several rough coffins in it and no mourners following; barouches, with invalid officers, rolled round the corner, and carriage loads of pretty children, with black coachmen, footmen, and maids. The women who took their walks abroad, were so extinguished in three story bonnets, with overhanging balconies of flowers, that their charms were obscured; and all I can say of them is that they dressed in the worst possible taste, and walked like ducks.|$|R
60|$|As I dressed I glanced <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It was {{no wonder}} {{that no one was}} stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly {{finished}} when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse.|$|E
60|$|When I had {{finished}} giving instructions to Wada for the arranging of my things I looked <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch.</b> It was early yet, only several minutes after three so I went on deck again {{to witness the}} arrival of the crew.|$|E
6000|$|ROBERTS: '--a man brushed heavily against me, {{and then}} hurried {{on in the}} other direction. I had unbuttoned my coat to look <b>at</b> <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> under the lamp-post, and after he struck against me I clapped my hand to my waistcoat, and--phew!--' ...|$|E
60|$|Fifteen {{minutes later}} he was out again, without leopard skins, but full of information. By means of my card, of my hotel card, of <b>my</b> <b>watch,</b> and of the boy's fingers, I learned the following: that at six o'clock that evening he would arrive <b>at</b> <b>my</b> hotel with ten leopard skins for my inspection. Further, I learned that the skins were the {{property}} of one Captain Ernesto Becucci. Also, I learned that the boy's name was Eliceo.|$|R
6000|$|To {{stealing}} I {{can never}} come, [...] To pawn <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> I'm too genteel, [...] Besides, I left <b>my</b> <b>watch</b> <b>at</b> home, [...] How could I pawn it then at Lille? ...|$|R
