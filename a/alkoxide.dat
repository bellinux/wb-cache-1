25|$|In the {{presence}} of a very high concentration of base, the aldehyde first forms a doubly charged anion from which a hydride ion is transferred to the second molecule of aldehyde to form carboxylate and <b>alkoxide</b> ions. Subsequently, the <b>alkoxide</b> ion acquires a proton from the solvent.|$|E
25|$|If the {{catalyst}} is a moderate base such as hydroxide ion or an <b>alkoxide,</b> the aldol reaction occurs via nucleophilic {{attack by the}} resonance-stabilized enolate on the carbonyl group of another molecule. The product is the <b>alkoxide</b> salt of the aldol product. The aldol itself is then formed, and it may then undergo dehydration to give the unsaturated carbonyl compound. The scheme shows a simple mechanism for the base-catalyzed aldol reaction of an aldehyde with itself.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} {{is called the}} Williamson ether synthesis. It involves treatment of a parent alcohol with a strong base to form the <b>alkoxide,</b> followed by addition of an appropriate aliphatic compound bearing a suitable leaving group (R–X). Suitable leaving groups (X) include iodide, bromide, or sulfonates. This method usually does not work well for aryl halides (e.g. bromobenzene, see Ullmann condensation below). Likewise, this method only gives the best yields for primary halides. Secondary and tertiary halides are prone to undergo E2 elimination on exposure to the basic <b>alkoxide</b> anion used in the reaction due to steric hindrance from the large alkyl groups.|$|E
50|$|Silicon <b>alkoxides</b> are a {{group of}} <b>alkoxides,</b> {{chemical}} compounds of silicon and an alcohol, with the formula (R)4.|$|R
50|$|Phenoxides {{are close}} {{relatives}} of the <b>alkoxides,</b> in which the alkyl group {{is replaced by a}} derivative of benzene. Phenol is more acidic than a typical alcohol; thus, phenoxides are correspondingly less basic and less nucleophilic than <b>alkoxides.</b> They are, however, often easier to handle, and yield derivatives that are more crystalline than those of the <b>alkoxides.</b>|$|R
50|$|Characteristically, {{transition}} metal <b>alkoxides</b> are polynuclear, that is they contain {{more than one}} metal. <b>Alkoxides</b> are sterically undemanding and highly basic ligands that tend to bridge metals.|$|R
25|$|Alcohols {{behave as}} weak acids, {{undergoing}} deprotonation, but strong bases are required. The deprotonation reaction {{to produce an}} <b>alkoxide</b> salt is performed with a strong base such as sodium hydride or sodium metal.|$|E
25|$|Potassium alkoxides {{eliminate}} quickly, while sodium alkoxides generally require heating. Magnesium alkoxides only eliminate {{in extreme}} conditions. The order of reactivity of alkoxides, K > Na >> Mg, {{is consistent with}} higher electron density on oxygen, hence increasing the <b>alkoxide</b> nucleophilicity.|$|E
25|$|One approach, {{demonstrated}} by Evans, is to silylate the aldol adduct. A silicon reagent such as TMSCl is {{added in the}} reaction, which replaces the metal on the <b>alkoxide,</b> allowing turnover of the metal catalyst. Minimizing the number of reaction steps and amount of reactive chemicals used leads to a cost-effective and industrially useful reaction.|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} {{about the}} role of <b>alkoxides</b> in the most recent uses of the sol-gel process in the synthesis of new materials is presented. Special attention is focused on the uses of silicon, aluminum, zirconium and titanium <b>alkoxides.</b> This review shows that the <b>alkoxides</b> enable the synthesis of new matrices with controlled surface area, acidity and porosity, as well as some unusual properties. The property associated with the solubility of metal <b>alkoxides</b> opens enormous possibilities of combining them for the synthesis films of powders with a very large range of metal compositions...|$|R
50|$|The {{structures}} of the titanium <b>alkoxides</b> are often complex. Crystalline titanium methoxide is tetrameric with the molecular formula Ti4(OCH3)16. <b>Alkoxides</b> derived from bulkier alcohols such as isopropanol aggregate less. Titanium isopropoxide is mainly a monomer in nonpolar solvents.|$|R
40|$|A {{serious problem}} in the {{production}} of homogenous binary gels is the different reactivity of the <b>alkoxides</b> used. In the special case of silicon <b>alkoxides</b> and aluminium <b>alkoxides,</b> the difference is some orders of magnitude. A common procedure to decrease the reactivity is the complexation of the <b>alkoxides</b> by a chelating agent, e. g., ß-diketones. Particle formation in the system aluminium-sec-butylate-ß-diketone-TEOS in an alcoholic solution was studied by SAXS and IR spectoscopy {{to learn more about the}} effect of chelation. The most important effect of the chelating agent was shown to be the reduction of the number of possible condensation sites. Some gels were prepared and supercritically dried. Translucent aerogels were obtained under suitable hydrolysis conditions...|$|R
25|$|Although only a {{catalytic}} {{amount of}} base {{is required in}} some cases, the more usual procedure {{is to use a}} stoichiometric amount of a strong base such as LDA or NaHMDS. In this case, enolate formation is irreversible, and the aldol product is not formed until the metal <b>alkoxide</b> of the aldol product is protonated in a separate workup step.|$|E
25|$|In the Tishchenko reaction, {{the base}} used is an <b>alkoxide</b> rather than hydroxide, {{and the product}} is an ester rather than the {{separate}} alcohol and carboxylate groups. After the nucleophilic base attacks an aldehyde, the resulting new oxygen anion attacks another aldehyde to give a hemiacetal linkage {{between two of the}} formerly aldehyde-containing reactants rather than undergoing tetrahedral collapse. Eventually tetrahedral collapse does occur, giving the stable ester product.|$|E
25|$|Under {{strongly}} basic conditions, the deprotonated substrate {{reacts with}} the N-oxyammonium species. Attack of the substrate <b>alkoxide</b> on either nitrogen or oxygen may occur, although {{the former is}} believed to operate {{on the basis of}} on observations of oxidations of N-alkoxy amines (which, presumably, proceed via intermediate 1). Comproportionation of the reduced product (a hydroxylamine) with the oxoammonium ion competes with oxidation; thus, an excess of the oxidizing agent is often required.|$|E
25|$|With alcohols, <b>alkoxides</b> are formed.|$|R
50|$|With alcohols, <b>alkoxides</b> are formed.|$|R
50|$|Enolates are {{unsaturated}} <b>alkoxides</b> {{derived by}} deprotonation of a C-H bond {{adjacent to a}} ketone or aldehyde. The nucleophilic center for simple <b>alkoxides</b> {{is located on the}} oxygen, whereas the nucleophilic site on enolates is delocalized onto both carbon and oxygen sites.|$|R
25|$|The {{reaction}} {{occurs in}} the presence of 2,2'-dipyridyl disulfide and triphenylphosphine. The reaction is generally refluxed in a nonpolar solvent such as benzene. The mechanism begins with formation of the 2-pyridinethiol ester (scheme 19). Proton-transfer provides a dipolar intermediate in which the <b>alkoxide</b> nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbonyl center, providing a tetrahedral intermediate that yields the macrolactone product. One of the first examples of this protocol was applied to the total synthesis of zearalenone (scheme 20).|$|E
25|$|The PN {{molecule}} {{is considered}} unstable, {{but is a}} product of crystalline phosphorus nitride decomposition at 1100 K. Similarly, H2PN is considered unstable, and phosphorus nitride halogens like F2PN, Cl2PN, Br2PN, and I2PN oligomerise into cyclic Polyphosphazenes. For example, compounds of the formula (PNCl2)n exist mainly as rings such as the trimer hexachlorophosphazene. The phosphazenes arise by treatment of phosphorus pentachloride with ammonium chloride:PCl5 + NH4Cl → 1/n (NPCl2)n + 4 HClWhen the chloride groups are replaced by <b>alkoxide</b> (RO−), a family of polymers is produced with potentially useful properties.|$|E
25|$|By definition, {{condensation}} liberates a small molecule, such {{as water}} or alcohol. This type of reaction can continue to build larger and larger silicon-containing molecules {{by the process of}} polymerization. Thus, a polymer is a huge molecule (or macromolecule) formed from hundreds or thousands of units called monomers. The number of bonds that a monomer can form is called its functionality. Polymerization of silicon <b>alkoxide,</b> for instance, can lead to complex branching of the polymer, because a fully hydrolyzed monomer Si(OH)4 is tetrafunctional (can branch or bond in 4 different directions). Alternatively, under certain conditions (e.g., low water concentration) fewer than 4 of the OR or OH groups (ligands) will be capable of condensation, so relatively little branching will occur. The mechanisms of hydrolysis and condensation, and the factors that bias the structure toward linear or branched structures are the most critical issues of sol-gel science and technology. This reaction is favored in both basic and acidic conditions.|$|E

25|$|The {{fundamental}} step, {{and usually}} the last, in {{the synthesis of}} β-blockers consists of adding a propanolamine side chain. This can be done following two paths which both involve alkylation of an appropriate phenoxide with epichlorohydrin (ECH). The first way is shown as the upper way in figure 5. It consists of phenoxide reacting at the oxirane and resulting in an <b>alkoxide,</b> that displaces the adjacent chloride {{to form a new}} epoxide ring. The second way is shown as the lower route in figure 5. It consists of displacement of the halogen directly with a SN2 reaction to give the same glycidic ether. When following both pathways, the central chiral carbon preserves its configuration, which is an important part to consider when synthesizing enantiomerically defined drugs. The ring opening of the epoxide ring in glycidic ether is done with an appropriate amine, such as isopropyl amine or tert-butylamine, and leads to the aryloxypropanolamine compound that consist of a secondary amine. This amine is typically known as the structural requirement for the β-adrenergic blocking activity.|$|E

This paper discusses some recent examples from CERM, showing that tin (IV) <b>alkoxides</b> can advantageously replace the aluminum counterparts as ROP initiators.
