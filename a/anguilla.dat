The association is affiliated to the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) and the team has, as of December 2009, entered seven Caribbean Cup competitions and three FIFA World Cup qualification campaigns. Montserrat played their first international fixture in 1991, which ended in a 0–3 defeat by Saint Lucia. In their second match, they secured a 1–1 draw with <b>Anguilla.</b> Montserrat lost their next seven matches before achieving their first ever victory on 26 March 1995, when they defeated <b>Anguilla</b> 3–2 at the Blakes Estate Stadium in Plymouth. Montserrat also went on to win their next match, again defeating <b>Anguilla</b> 1–0.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent to the {{confirmation}} {{of the existence of}} Hurricane Alice, the U.S. Weather Bureau Office in San Juan, Puerto Rico warned the islands of the northern Lesser Antilles to prepare for strong winds and rough seas. Hurricane Alice produced moderate to strong winds across the islands, peaking at 81mph (130km/h) in Saint Barthélemy and 75mph (120km/h) in Saba. The hurricane dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across several islands, including a peak of 11.27inches (286mm) in 48hours recorded at Saba. Due to its small size, only a few islands received significant effects from the hurricane. Saint-Barthélemy, Saba, <b>Anguilla,</b> Sint Eustatius, and Saint Kitts reported damage from the hurricane, totaling $623,500 (1955USD, $4.7million 2006USD). Damage was heaviest on Saba and <b>Anguilla,</b> occurring primarily to shipping facilities and crops. 626houses were destroyed or severely damaged on <b>Anguilla,</b> as well. The damage was caused mostly by heavy rainfall and rough seas, not the direct action of the wind. The passage of Hurricane Alice greatly troubled the economies of the small affected islands. Additionally, the outer rainbands of the storm alleviated dry conditions on Puerto Rico which had persisted since the previous October. No deaths were reported.|$|E
5|$|The British Crown {{possesses}} {{a number of}} overseas territories in the Americas, for whom Queen Elizabeth II is monarch. In North America are <b>Anguilla,</b> Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and the Turks and Caicos Islands, while the Falkland Islands, and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are located in South America. The Caribbean islands were colonised under the authority or the direct instruction {{of a number of}} European monarchs, mostly English, Dutch, or Spanish, throughout {{the first half of the}} 17th century. By 1681, however, when the Turks and Caicos Islands were settled by Britons, all of the above-mentioned islands were under the control of Charles II of England, Scotland, France and Ireland. Colonies were merged and split through various reorganizations of the Crown's Caribbean regions, until 19 December 1980, the date that <b>Anguilla</b> became a British Crown territory in its own right. The monarch is represented in these jurisdictions by: the Governor of <b>Anguilla,</b> Andrew George; the Governor of Bermuda, Richard Gozney; the Governor of the British Virgin Islands, David Pearey; the Governor of the Cayman Islands, Stuart Jack; the Governor of Montserrat, Elizabeth Carriere; and the Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands, Peter Beckingham.|$|E

Operationally, lack of definitive data prevented the U.S. Weather Bureau from declaring the system a hurricane until January 2. It received the name Alice in early 1955, though re-analysis {{of the data}} supported extending its track to the previous year, resulting in two tropical cyclones {{of the same name}} in one season.|$|E
5|$|On August22, governments {{across the}} Lesser Antilles issued {{tropical}} storm watches.

40|$|Abstract The {{organisation}} of the praesoma in the para-site Acanthocephalus <b>anguillae</b> was studied on {{the light}} and electron microscopic level, with emphasis on the morphology of the musculature. The study was compiled to add new data to the ground pattern of the Acantho-cephala for analysis of the phylogenetic relationships within the Gnathifera. In A. <b>anguillae</b> the praesomal epi-dermis and lemnisci form a coherent syncytium, separat-ed from the epidermis of the trunk. Hooks are seen to be derivatives of the subepidermal basal lamina and are covered by the praesomal epidermis. The praesomal cir-cular body wall musculature forms a network of ana-stomosing muscle fibres that lines the proboscis; a prae-somal longitudinal body wall musculature does not exist. The truncal circular and longitudinal body wall muscula-ture rise up to the praesomal proboscis. The unpaired proboscis retractor, consisting of longitudinal circomyar fibres, forms an outer and an inner concentric tube; the latter extends through the entire praesoma and penetrates the receptacle wall. The sack-like receptacle is surround-ed by a receptacle constrictor. The nervous system of the praesoma consists of a prominent cerebral ganglion, three nerves which extend anteriorly, ramify and end within the praesomal musculature, and two strong lateral posterior nerves. A. <b>anguillae</b> lacks an apical organ, lat-eral organs and a support cell. Many of the features pres-ent in the praesoma of A. <b>anguillae</b> can be assumed as ground-pattern characteristics of the Acanthocephala...|$|R

5|$|Summer Carnivals {{include those}} on Antigua, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Sint Eustatius, Saint John, Saint Lucia, Grenada, Saba, Nevis and <b>Anguilla,</b> {{the latter two}} of which are {{especially}} known for popular calypso competitions. Christmastime Carnivals are held on Montserrat, Saint Croix, Saint Martin and Saint Kitts; Montserrat's distinctive Carnival includes masquerades and steelbands, and both islands also feature calypso competitions. The Carnival of Sint Maarten, which takes place a month after Easter, is known for the burning of King Moui-Moui as the culmination of the festival. Many islands, especially the French and Dutch Antilles, are home to pre-Lenten Carnivals, including Martinique, Aruba, Saint-Barthélemy, Bonaire, Curaçao, Dominica, Saint Thomas and Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|The {{governments of}} the islands in the {{predicted}} path of Erika urged residents to quickly prepare for the hurricane through radio addresses. In the wake of busy seasons in 1995 and 1996, which some islands were still recovering from, emergency preparations began. In Puerto Rico, fishermen secured their boats {{in preparation for the}} storm. Also on the island, citizens formed long lines at gas stations and purchased emergency supplies. Officials in <b>Anguilla</b> enacted a plan that would turn off the island's power supply if the winds exceeded 50mph (80km/h). As a precaution, authorities on Saint Martin enacted a curfew for all but those in service jobs.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression maintained multiple cloud swirls within a common center. Banding features increased, though southwesterly wind shear {{and the lack}} of a well-defined circulation prevented initial strengthening. Dry air encountered the depression, and as such it developed very slowly; forecasters maintained considerable difficulty in determining a center of circulation. It continued its motion to the west-northwest while tracking around the southern periphery of a deep-layer subtropical ridge to its north. Though convection remained focused near the outer periphery of the system, the overall organized continued to steadily increase, and it is estimated the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Florence on September 5 while located about 1,120miles (1,800km) east-northeast of <b>Anguilla.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Acanthocephalus <b>anguillae</b> is {{a species}} of {{parasitic}} worm in the phylum Acanthocephala. [...] An intestinal parasite, it is found both in the Baltic Sea and {{along the coast of}} California, where it is often found in the fore- and mid-gut of the Brown and Rainbow trouts.|$|R
40|$|Alternative {{transmission}} {{strategies are}} common in many parasitic organisms, often representing discrete phenotypes adopted in response to external cues. The facultative truncation of the normal 3 -host life-cycle to a 2 -host cycle in many trematodes provides an example: some individuals mature precociously, via progenesis, in their intermediate host and produce eggs without the need to reach a definitive host. The factors that determine howmany and which individuals adopt the truncated life-cycle within a parasite population remain unknown. We investigated the occurrence of progenesis in the trematode Stegodexamene <b>anguillae</b> within its fish intermediate host. Location within the host was a key determinant of progenesis. Although the size and egg output of progenetic metacercariae encysted in host gonads {{did not differ from}} those of the few progenetic metacercariae in other host tissues, the likelihood of metacercariae becoming progenetic was much higher for those in the gonads than those elsewhere in the host. Progenetic parasites can only evacuate their eggs along with host eggs or sperm, providing a link between the parasite’s transmission strategy and its location in the host. Host size and sex, and the presence of other parasite species in the host, did not affect the occurrence of progenesis in S. <b>anguillae.</b> However, the proportion of metacercariae in host gonads and the proportion of progenetic metacercariae both decreased with increasing numbers of S. <b>anguillae</b> per host. These results suggest that progenesis is adopted mostly by the parasites that successfully establish in host gonads. These are generally the first to infect a fish; subsequent arrivals settle in other tissues as the gonads quickly become saturated with parasites. In this system, the site of encystment within the fish host both promotes and constrains the adoption of a facultative, truncated life-cycle by the parasite.
