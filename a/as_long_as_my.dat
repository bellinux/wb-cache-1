Thereafter, she has said that she intends to [...] "slow down" [...] by focusing on her teaching, although she has remarked: [...] "There is really no such thing called a swan song, and I won't like to keep still after being so active. ... I will keep dancing <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> body will say yes to me".|$|E
500|$|The {{practices}} of individual schools and teams {{have changed in}} response to the controversy. A local example is Washington High School in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Many Native American images have been removed, and the [...] "Warriors" [...] nickname is now claimed to be generic. The school now has a [...] "circle of courage" [...] logo with eagle feathers and has also [...] "updated" [...] the murals of Chief Hollow Horn Bear in the gym. Duane Hollow Horn Bear, the chief's great-grandson, who teaches Lakota language and history at Sinte Gleska University in Mission, stated: [...] "We had no objection to their utilizing those pictures <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> great-grandfather was represented with honor and dignity." [...] However, not all Native Americans are happy with the presence of any such images.|$|E

2500|$|In 1965, {{together}} with Tam Harvey, Connolly started {{a group called}} the Humblebums. At their first gig, Connolly reportedly introduced them both to the audience by saying, [...] "My name's Billy Connolly, and I'm humble. This is Tam Harvey, he's a bum." [...] The band would later include Gerry Rafferty, who saw Connolly at a charity show in Paisley. [...] "Gerry was very good for me. He taught me that I would never be a musician <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>my</b> arse looked south. He was just so outstandingly good and getting better, and although I was getting better too, the space between us remained huge. He was a real musician, he knew and felt music, a bass player, with a lovely sense of harmony, as well as a great guitarist. I knew tunes and how to play them but that was where my musicianship ended. Unfortunately, I’m still the same to this day. I work very hard, I play every day but I’m still ordinary. I can be flashy, but it’s all tricks really. He’s a musician and I’m just not in the same league. So, I gave up these ambitions and concentrated on what I was really born to do." [...] After Harvey left the group, Connolly and Rafferty continued as a duo and the latter two of their three albums featured just that duo. [...] Connolly sang, played five-string banjo, guitar, and autoharp, and at live shows entertained the audience with his humorous introductions to the songs.|$|E
