5|$|Children of Men used several lengthy single-shot {{sequences}} {{in which}} extremely complex actions take place. The longest {{of these are}} a shot in which Kee gives birth (199 seconds; 3:19); an ambush on <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>road</b> (247 seconds; 4:07); and {{a scene in which}} Theo is captured by the Fishes, escapes, and runs down a street and through a building {{in the middle of a}} raging battle (378 seconds; 6:18). These sequences were extremely difficult to film, although the effect of continuity is sometimes an illusion, aided by CGI effects.|$|E
5|$|Avenged is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a melodrama focusing on John Warren, a young clerk, who is struck by a taxi cab while crossing the street. The chauffeur who struck him, Allen, decides to flee as a crowd gathers around John. Allen ditches his taxi on <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>road</b> and takes a train, successfully escaping. Six years later, the poor, ill and crippled John has become a timekeeper in a mining town. John's wife, who has taken care of him, sickens and dies. Allen, unaware of John's identity, attempts to comfort him and listens to John's story. After learning Allen wrecked his life, John attempts to shoot him, but the specter of his wife stays his hand. John goes to her grave, forgives Allen, and dies. No cast or production credits are known for this film. Released on October 7, 1910, the film was a distinct departure from other Thanhouser releases and was sharply criticized by reviewers. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Amway {{purchased}} WHN in New York, giving Mutual {{a second}} major-market owned-and-operated station. On <b>a</b> <b>Country</b> <b>Road,</b> a music show hosted by WHN's Lee Arnold, was introduced and given national distribution. At {{the beginning of}} the year, Mutual had begun airing Mutual Radio Theater, formerly Sears Radio Theater, which it had just picked up. A number of well-regarded dramas were produced as part of the anthology series. In 1981, Mutual launched Dick Clark's National Music Survey, a three-hour-long weekly program combining music and interviews. Despite these developments and the fact that its satellite network was now fully on line, Amway was making little if any profit out of Mutual. The network's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business. Mutual Radio Theater, the network's last ever original dramatic series, aired its final show on December 19, 1981. In November 1983, Amway sold off Mutual's WCFL to Statewide Broadcasting. A year later, a deal was struck for the sale of WHN to Doubleday Broadcasting.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from September 24, 1910. It states: [...] "The convict is discovered stealing along <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>road,</b> glancing about for signs of danger. His stripes are discernible on that portion of his breast and on that portion of his trousers' leg {{not covered by the}} long coat he wears - which cannot conceal the stripes that tell all; hence his keen watch for passersby. Still, he does not spy a nearby farmer until too late; the cry 'prisoner loose' is raised, and a dozen rustics make after the unfortunate. Convict meets accomplice who is waiting with carriage; jumps in the carriage and the pair drives off. Baffled pursuers come up, sight a wagon, all pile within and resume pursuit. Convict jumps from carriage and drops behind boulder, accomplice driving straight on with the wagon hot after him; when the wagon has passed him by, convict comes from behind boulder, crosses road and disappears on other side - but has been seen crossing the road by a small girl who kept out of sight until the convict had disappeared, but who now rushes off to tell of her discovery. Put back on the trail by the little girl, pursuers follow their quarry to the waterside, where a second accomplice awaits the convict with a rowboat, and into which he jumps and pulls for the other side. Another rowboat sets out in pursuit. One of the pursuers telephones constables {{on the other side of}} the water to catch convict when he tries to land." ...|$|E
500|$|The film is not lost, but {{a modern}} {{synopsis}} {{has not been}} published. The official synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World on December 24, 1910. It states: [...] "Jack Harkaway is of aristocratic birth, being {{the son of a}} wealthy Englishman's daughter and a poor young man, with whom she has eloped. Her parents bring about a separation and compel her to place the child in the hands of strangers, who are bribed to keep his whereabouts a secret from his mother. At the age of 12 Jack is placed in a school, the master of which is prejudiced against him, owing to the boy's mischievous disposition. After having received severe and unjust punishment from the schoolmaster, Jack decides to run away from school, and escapes from the room in which he is locked, through the window. Wandering along <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>road,</b> he accidentally overhears two sneak thieves planning to rob a house. Jack makes his way to the house in time to warn its mistress of the proposed robbery. Two [...] servants are placed in hiding, when the would-be thieves put in an appearance there and are immediately captured. Jack is given a fine supper by the lady of the house, who is very grateful to him. And when the schoolmaster, accompanied by Jack's guardian, arrives, she is touched by the boy's appeal not to be turned over to his rough-looking 'friends.' Upon getting a closer view of the man who calls himself the lad's guardian, she realizes that he is the man to whom she was forced to give over her child. The man admits that Jack is her own boy, and the picture ends with the men being turned {{out of the house and}} Jack restored to his mother's arms." ...|$|E
