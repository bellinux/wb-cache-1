50|$|On September 16 of {{a certain}} year in the 1980s, the United States conducts an orbital test of the new Space Ranger <b>antimissile</b> <b>laser</b> defense system. American {{scientist}} Burt Gains oversees the test {{under the aegis of}} the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency with the target warhead being launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base as the international media covers it. The Space Ranger module successfully destroys the warhead and the crew of the Space Voyager shuttle carrying the module returns to worldwide adulation. Gains looks at the successful test as a sign that nuclear war can be prevented, but has reservations about its potential to inflame the arms race. His sister Laura, and his best friend Wataru Mikumo soon find out that he was kidnapped by Soviet spies while heading off to work. A Soviet Alfa-class submarine is tasked to transport Burt to Vladivostok. Seeing the danger of Burt forced to replicate his Space Ranger work for the Soviets, US President Gibson orders the submarine sunk with nuclear torpedoes.|$|E

The description of the installations in the book matches closely its actual configuration though not its real purpose, as the book is based on Okno being a <b>laser</b> <b>antimissile</b> system. The facility is also featured in the game Operation Flashpoint: Red River as an anti-aircraft base.|$|R
