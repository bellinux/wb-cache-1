50|$|In most instances, <b>a</b> shorter <b>neck</b> or chin suits <b>a</b> {{somewhat}} higher <b>neck</b> edge; <b>a</b> longer <b>neck</b> or chin suits <b>a</b> somewhat lower <b>neck</b> edge. An extra wide <b>neck</b> suits <b>a</b> somewhat narrower <b>neck</b> edge while <b>a</b> thinner <b>neck</b> or protruding ears suit <b>a</b> wider <b>neck</b> edge. When slightly longer sideburns are worn than {{are appropriate for}} a style, it can shorten {{the appearance of the}} face; when slightly shorter sideburns are worn than are appropriate, it can lengthen the appearance of the face; therefore, the appearance of a face that is shorter or longer than average, in particular when due to the length of the chin or lower face, can be normalized by altering the length of the sideburns.|$|R
