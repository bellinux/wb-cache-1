Other fruits include nightshade, <b>apples</b> <b>and</b> <b>pears.</b> They readily visit melon fields during the summer months. A well-fed wolf stores fat under the skin, around the heart, intestines, kidneys, and bone marrow, particularly during the autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|Cooking {{onions and}} sweet onions are better stored at room temperature, optimally {{in a single}} layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, cooking onions have a shelf life of {{three to four weeks}} and sweet onions one to two weeks. Cooking onions will absorb odours from <b>apples</b> <b>and</b> <b>pears.</b> Also, they draw {{moisture}} from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay.|$|E
5|$|The orchard {{contains}} {{fruit trees}} such as quinces, medlars, crab <b>apples</b> <b>and</b> <b>pears</b> are underplanted with spring-flowering meadow {{plants such as}} snakeshead fritillaries, camassias, narcissus, cowslips and lady's smock. The orchard is crossed by wide mown paths meeting at a central sundial. Originally four weeping elms were situated at {{the four corners of}} the garden, but they succumbed to Dutch elm disease in the early seventies and were replaced in 1973 by four weeping ash trees which make inviting 'houses'. The orchard can be viewed from the raised walk on its east side, another idea copied from Avebury Manor. A main path known as the Long walk is based on the Long Walk at Hidcote Manor Garden in Gloucestershire, although it is on a smaller scale. It is a plain grassed walkway connecting the Raised Walk with the Pond Garden.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the fertile}} soil in Union County, the county's farmers {{required}} minimal fertilizer. There {{were hundreds of}} farms in the county in its early stages. The crops grown in Union County's early history included wheat, oats, corn, Irish potatoes, clover and alfalfa.

As marine refrigeration was still in its infancy, this particular venture seems to have been something of a hit-and-miss affair, with some fruit shipments arriving in Britain in good condition and others not.|$|E

25|$|After {{the closing}} of the Methodist Mission in Salem, David Leslie {{received}} the land in what is now between Bush's Pasture Park and the Willamette River, and McGilchrist and Mission streets in Salem.

In 1845, he was elected {{as the president of the}} board of trustees at the Oregon Institute and continued in this role until his death. During this time Oregon Institute would become Willamette University, and during this time Leslie laid the cornerstone for Waller Hall that still stands today as the oldest building on Willamette’s campus.|$|E
25|$|Examples {{of fixed}} {{transhumance}} {{are found in}} the North Governorate of Lebanon. Towns and villages located in the Qadisha valley are at an average altitude of 1,400 meters. Some settlements, like Ehden and Kfarsghab, are used during summer periods from beginning of June till mid-October. Inhabitants move in October to coastal towns situated at an average of 200 meters above sea level. The transhumance is motivated by agricultural activities (historically by the mulberry silkworm culture). The main crops in the coastal towns are olive, grape and citrus. For the mountain towns, the crops are summer fruits, mainly <b>apples</b> <b>and</b> <b>pears.</b> Other examples of transhumance exist in Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|Although both {{exploration}} and settlement were {{hampered by the}} island's mountainous topography, the colony soon established itself, and local food production replaced a dependency on external supply, and settlers began to better exploit the area's natural resources. The climate, similar to England's, {{was found to be}} suitable for fruit orchards, particularly <b>apples</b> <b>and</b> <b>pears,</b> and the raising of livestock soon also began. The best resource of southern Van Diemen's Land though, was the sea. The River Derwent possesses one of the finest deep-water natural harbours in the world, and abundant marine life provided plentiful food supplies. Whaling and sealing soon cropped up as important industries, and provided the economic backbone of Hobart Town in its first decade.|$|E

500|$|Fruit was readily {{combined}} with meat, fish and eggs. The recipe for Tart de brymlent, a fish pie from the recipe collection Forme of Cury, includes {{a mix of}} figs, raisins, <b>apples</b> <b>and</b> <b>pears</b> with fish (salmon, codling or haddock) and pitted damson plums under the top crust. It was considered important {{to make sure that}} the dish agreed with contemporary standards of medicine and dietetics. This meant that food had to be [...] "tempered" [...] according to its nature by an appropriate combination of preparation and mixing certain ingredients, condiments and spices; fish was seen as being cold and moist, and best cooked in a way that heated and dried it, such as frying or oven baking, and seasoned with hot and dry spices; beef was dry and hot and should therefore be boiled; pork was hot and moist and should therefore always be roasted. In some recipe collections, alternative ingredients were assigned with more consideration to the humoral nature than what a modern cook would consider to be similarity in taste. In a recipe for quince pie, cabbage is said to work equally well, and in another turnips could be replaced by pears.|$|E
500|$|Juices, {{as well as}} wines, of a {{multitude}} of fruits and berries had been known at least since Roman antiquity and were still consumed in the Middle Ages: [...] pomegranate, mulberry and blackberry wines, perry, and cider which was especially popular in the north where both <b>apples</b> <b>and</b> <b>pears</b> were plentiful. Medieval drinks that have survived to this day include prunellé from wild plums (modern-day slivovitz), mulberry gin and blackberry wine. Many variants of mead {{have been found in}} medieval recipes, with or without alcoholic content. However, the honey-based drink became less common as a table beverage {{towards the end of the}} period and was eventually relegated to medicinal use. Mead has often been presented as the common drink of the Slavs. This is partially true since mead bore great symbolic value at important occasions. When agreeing on treaties and other important affairs of state, mead was often presented as a ceremonial gift. It was also common at weddings and baptismal parties, though in limited quantity due to its high price. In medieval Poland, mead had a status equivalent to that of imported luxuries, such as spices and wines. Kumis, the fermented milk of mares or camels, was known in Europe, but as with mead was mostly something prescribed by physicians.|$|E
500|$|Described by the Weather Bureau as [...] "a {{most unusual}} tempest," [...] {{the storm was}} one of only four to produce hurricane-force winds in New Jersey. The storm's strong surf {{destroyed}} several boats along the coastline, including 34 in Waretown. Less than 10% of the people in Atlantic City evacuated, and after the storm, many people visited the city to observe the storm damage described in newspapers. High winds disrupted 800telephone lines in Atlantic City, and most communications were cut from the Jersey Shore to the Philadelphia region. Initial damage reports were provided by trains, although there were severe transportation delays due to ongoing flooding. The disrupted communications sparked [...] "wild rumors that the great resort had been entirely washed away," [...] according to The New York Times. Monetary damage in Atlantic City was estimated around $1million (1903USD). Atlantic City's power was deliberately shut off to prevent accidents. In the city, the roof of one hotel and the porch of another were destroyed. Trees and awnings were damaged, and thousands of windows were damaged. The winds destroyed the roofs of an estimated 50 to 60cottages. The surf damaged or destroyed most fishing piers and oceanfront pavilions in the Atlantic City area, with tons of debris dispersed across the beach. The strong winds, combined with heavy rainfall, resulted in one indirect fatality when a man, unable to see owing to the hurricane, drove into a train in Cape May. In Asbury Park, the storm wrecked the roofs of six hotels. High waves damaged the boardwalks at Belmar and Allenhurst. High winds heavily damaged fruit crops in Monmouth, Middlesex, and Hunterdon counties. Fruit trees were uprooted in Vineland, and in Flemington, about 75% of <b>apples</b> <b>and</b> <b>pears</b> were lost. Damage across the state was estimated at $8million (1903USD); the worst of the damage occurred in Atlantic City, though moderate damage extended from Cape May northward through Asbury Park.|$|E
