5|$|Jadid's {{government}} {{was the most}} radical administration in Syria's history. The coup created a permanent schism between the Syrian and Iraqi regional branches of the Ba'ath Party and their respective National Commands, with many senior Syrian Ba'athists defecting to Iraq. As <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>of</b> the coup, during Jadid's rule, Syria initiated a propaganda campaign against the Iraqi Ba'athists. Jadid's government would be overthrown in the Corrective Movement of 1970, which brought Hafez al-Assad to power.|$|E
5|$|On 17 May 1882, {{two years}} after graduation, Druitt was {{admitted}} to the Inner Temple, one of the qualifying bodies for English barristers. His father had promised him <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>of</b> £500 (equivalent to £ today), and Druitt paid his membership fees with a loan from his father secured against the inheritance. He was called to the bar on 29 April 1885, and set up a practice as a barrister and special pleader.|$|E
5|$|Set against this, the purges of the Red Army leadership, {{in which}} Molotov participated, {{weakened}} the Soviet Union's defence capacity {{and contributed to}} the military disasters of 1941 and 1942, which were mostly caused by unreadiness for war. The purges also led to the dismantling of privatised agriculture and its replacement by collectivised agriculture. This left <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>of</b> chronic agricultural inefficiencies and under-production which the Soviet regime never fully rectified.|$|E

5|$|Settlements of the Gold Rush era, such as Portuguese Flat on the Sacramento River, sprang into {{existence}} and then faded. The Gold Rush town of Weaverville on the Trinity River today retains the oldest continuously used Taoist temple in California, <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>of</b> Chinese miners who came. While {{there are not}} many Gold Rush era ghost towns still in existence, the remains of the once-bustling town of Shasta have been preserved in a California State Historic Park in Northern California.|$|E
5|$|The {{supersonic}} F-100 left <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>of</b> many crashes {{over its}} years of service; nearly 25 percent were lost to accidents.

5|$|A {{common theme}} in Humphrey de Bohun's actions was his fierce {{protection}} {{of what he}} regarded as his feudal privileges. His career was marked by turbulence and political strife, particularly in the Marches of Wales, but eventually he left <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>of</b> consolidated possessions there. In 1297, {{at the height of}} the conflict between Edward I and rebellious barons, the king had actively tried to undermine Hereford's authority in the Marches, but failed due to the good relations the earl enjoyed with the local men.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{buildings}} of Fort Yellowstone, the army left <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>of</b> {{policies and practices}} that served as precedents for the future National Park Service management of national parks. The army military commanders implemented backcountry patrols, wildlife protection and management, and protection of natural features. Army educational programs were later adopted by the National Park Service {{as part of their}} resource management. The army effectively implemented law enforcement priorities and developed a ranger force that provided for prosecution and punishment of those engaged in illegal activity in the national parks. The National Park Service carried over a version of the campaign hat worn by members of the army during the last years of their management of Yellowstone National Park for use by Park Rangers.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1950s Waugh was troubled {{on a number}} of fronts. He was afflicted with writer's block, and was unable to make {{progress}} with his current novel, the second in his Sword of Honour trilogy. He had financial worries, <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>of</b> his free-spending post-war habits combined with accumulated tax liabilities and a lack of remunerative productivity. His general health was poor; he suffered from toothache, sciatica and rheumatism, and his memory was faulty. He was also drinking heavily, the effects of which were aggravated by a large intake of chloral and bromide washed down with crème de menthe—a treatment for insomnia that he concealed from his doctors.|$|E

5|$|Christianity {{led to the}} {{development}} of a few phenomena characteristic of Byzantium. Namely, the intimate connection between Church and State, <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>of</b> Roman cultus. Also, the creation of a Christian philosophy that guided Byzantine Greeks in their everyday lives. And finally, the dichotomy between the Christian ideals of the Bible and classical Greek paideia which could not be left out, however, since so much of Christian scholarship and philosophy depended on it. These shaped Byzantine Greek character and the perceptions of themselves and others.|$|E
5|$|Ditton is {{situated}} between the Lower Weald and the Chalk (North) Downs. The parish encompasses the Lower Greensand strata, where a formation of hard sandy limestone {{known as the}} Hythe Beds is abundant. From this formation ragstone is obtained. Kentish ragstone was a historically important building material in south east England. The Romans used ragstone {{in the construction of}} London and villas in the south-east. Medieval builders used ragstone to build churches, civic buildings, houses and bridges over local rivers. The predominance of ragstone beds in the locality gave Ditton <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>of</b> quarrying which continues today.|$|E
5|$|Erected at {{the behest}} of the Illinois General Assembly, the University of Illinois Observatory became {{important}} in the development of astronomy due, in large part, to pioneering research by Dr. Stebbins, from 1907 to 1922. Joel Stebbins left the University of Illinois in 1922 but left behind <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>of</b> discovery that helped alter the face of modern astronomy. The building served the University of Illinois astronomy department from its opening until 1979, when the department moved into a new, larger building to house its growing staff.|$|E

5|$|George Orwell's book The Road to Wigan Pier was {{illustrated}} by {{a photograph of}} homes in the Rosehall area of Coatbridge. In 1934 there was an exodus to Corby in England when the local Union Plant relocated. This {{had the effect of}} a hammer blow impact on the town's iron industry and ushered in the end of serious iron production. The decline of the Clydeside shipbuilding industry in the 1950s meant the demand for iron finally collapsed. <b>A</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>of</b> 'devastating' unemployment, appalling housing conditions and some of the worst overcrowding in Scotland left its stamp on the Coatbridge of the early 1930s. As late as 1936 Coatbridge was the most overcrowded place in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In Anglo-Saxon {{times the}} river formed a {{boundary}} between Wessex and Dumnonia. It later served the Port of Bridgwater, and enabled cargoes {{to be transported}} inland. The arrival of the railways led {{to a decline in}} commercial shipping, and the only working docks are at Dunball. Man's influence on the river has left <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>of</b> bridges and industrial artefacts. The Parrett along with its connected waterways and network of drains supports an ecosystem that includes several rare species of flora and fauna. The River Parrett Trail has been established {{along the banks of the}} river.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia is {{a federal}} {{constitutional}} elective monarchy, and the only federation in Southeast Asia. The system of government is closely modelled on that of the Westminster parliamentary system, <b>a</b> <b>legacy</b> <b>of</b> British colonial rule. The head of state is the Yangdi-PertuanAgong, {{commonly referred to as}} the King. The King is elected to a five-year term by and from among the nine hereditary rulers of the Malay states; the other four states, which have titular Governors, do not participate in the selection. By informal agreement the position is systematically rotated among the nine, and has been held by Muhammad V of Kelantan since December 2016. The King's role has been largely ceremonial since changes to the constitution in 1994, picking ministers and members of the upper house.|$|E
