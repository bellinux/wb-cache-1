Totayam is performed behind a curtain and without all the costumes, while Puruppatu is performed without the curtain and in full costumes.|$|E

500|$|It is Monday morning, {{and five}} {{days until the}} first game of the season for high school {{football}} team Dillon Panthers. While coach Eric Taylor is surveying the field, some of the players <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> for practice. Fullback Tim Riggins is recovering from a hangover, and his brother Billy warns him that he could be kicked off the team if he does not show. Meanwhile, second-string quarterback Matt Saracen is preparing lunch for his grandmother, before his friend Landry Clarke drives him to practice. At the stadium, a television crew is conducting interviews. It is revealed that coach Taylor, who has recently been made head coach, used to coach the exceptionally gifted quarterback Jason Street. It also becomes clear that there is a deep-seated conflict between Tim Riggins and the brash and loud-mouthed running back Brian [...] "Smash" [...] Williams. Later, at the local fast food restaurant where the players regularly hang out, Landry and Matt try to approach the coach's daughter Julie. She insists that she does not associate with football players. They assure her that Landry is not on the team and Matt gets virtually no playing time because of Street, but she still rebuffs them both.|$|E
