5|$|The {{discovery}} of the physical representation of heredity came along with evolutionary principles and population genetics. In the 1940s and early 1950s, experiments pointed to DNA as the component of chromosomes that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as genes. A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as viruses and bacteria, along with the {{discovery of}} the double helical structure of DNA in 1953, marked the transition to the era of molecular genetics. From the 1950s to present times, biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain. The genetic code was cracked by Har Gobind Khorana, Robert W. Holley and Marshall Warren Nirenberg after DNA was understood to contain codons. Finally, the Human Genome Project was launched in 1990 with the goal of mapping the general human genome. This project was essentially completed in 2003, with further analysis still being published.

40|$|Abstract: Firms <b>accumulate</b> <b>knowledge</b> through product {{development}} {{activities such as}} efficient product design, various experimental data, and know-how of project management. By exploiting this knowledge, firms are able to improve product quality, reduce cost, and shorten the development lead time. The more firms <b>accumulate</b> <b>knowledge,</b> the more {{they are able to}} gain competitiveness by exploiting their knowledge. However, because of efficiency gained by exploitation, firms can sometimes excessively exploit their knowledge, thus making their products too similar to and less attractive than earlier products and, as a result, lose competitiveness. In this paper, we employ a time series analysis to show that excess exploitation of know-how reduced product creativity in the Japanese video game industry...|$|R

2500|$|Of the 907 signs {{listed by}} Borger (2003), some 200 have no {{encoding}} {{at a single}} codepoint. Conversely, a number of combinations considered reducible by Borger were assigned unique codepoints. These differences are due {{to the difficulty of}} establishing what represents a single character in cuneiform, and indeed most of Borger's items not encoded have straightforward etymological decomposition. There are still quite a number of universally recognized signs missing, and criticism has been voiced to the effect that the encoding [...] "disregards {{an important part of the}} <b>accumulated</b> <b>knowledge</b> of generations of assyriologists about what actually function as single signs in normal texts, and are reflected in the traditional sign lists, most recently and comprehensively Borger's Mesopotamische Zeichenliste". For example, there are signs written as ligatures of varying constituent signs, such as KURUM7 (Borger 2003 no. 729) that was written IGI.NÍG in early times, but later IGI.ERIM. Since there is no codepoint for KURUM7, the sign must be expressed as either IGI.NÍG (U+12146 U+1243C, [...] ) or IGI.ERIM (U+12146 U+1209F, [...] ) depending on the shape of the glyph, in violation of the basic principle of Unicode to encode characters, not glyphs. While those signs can in principle still be added by a [...] "Cuneiform Extended" [...] range in the future, as has been done for a number of other scripts ("Latin Extended" [...] etc.), their absence as of Unicode 7.0 means that the standard's usability for the encoding of actual texts is limited.|$|E

60|$|What is the {{tangible}} result, {{and what the}} gain of all these labours? The answer is the secret of University discontent. All this <b>accumulated</b> <b>knowledge</b> goes out in teaching, is scattered abroad in lectures, is caught up in note-books, and is poured out, with a difference, in examinations. There is not an amount of original literary work produced by the University which bears any due proportion to the solid materials accumulated. It is just the reverse of Falstaff's case--but one halfpenny-worth of sack to an intolerable deal of bread; but a drop {{of the spirit of}} learning to cart-loads of painfully acquired knowledge. The time and energy of men is occupied in amassing facts, in lecturing, and then in eternal examinations. Even if the results are satisfactory on the whole, even if a hundred well-equipped young men are turned out of the examining-machine every year, these arrangements certainly curb individual ambition. If a resident in Oxford is to make an income that seems adequate, he must lecture, examine, and write manuals and primers, till he is grey, and till the energy that might have added something new and valuable to the acquisitions of the world has departed.|$|E
6000|$|Among our greater artists, {{the chief}} want, {{at the present}} day, is that of solemnity and {{definite}} purpose. We have too much picture-manufacturing, too much making up of lay figures with a certain quantity of foliage, and a certain quantity of sky, and a certain quantity of water,--a little bit {{of all that is}} pretty, a little sun, and a little shade,--a touch of pink, and a touch of blue,--a little sentiment, and a little sublimity, and a little humor, and a little antiquarianism,--all very neatly associated in a very charming picture, but not working together for a definite end. Or if the aim be higher, {{as was the case with}} Barrett and Varley, we are generally put off with stale repetitions of eternal composition; a great tree, and some goats, and a bridge and a lake, and the Temple at Tivoli, etc. Now we should like to see our artists working out, with all exertion of their concentrated powers, such marked pieces of landscape character as might bear upon them the impression of solemn, earnest, and pervading thought, definitely directed, and aided by every accessory of detail, color, and idealized form, which the disciplined feeling, <b>accumulated</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and unspared labor of the painter could supply.

I appeal to the reader, whether there is any trace of insanity in the style or method, of the story he has been reading. I am a young man locked away in an old man's body. But the clear fact is incredible to everyone. Naturally I appear demented to those who will not believe this, naturally I do not know the names of my secretaries, of the doctors who come to see me, of my servants and neighbours, of this town (wherever it is) where I find myself. Naturally I lose myself in my own house, and suffer inconveniences of every sort. Naturally I ask the oddest questions. Naturally I weep and cry out, and have paroxysms of despair. I have no money and no cheque-book. The bank will not recognise my signature, for I suppose that, allowing for the feeble muscles I now have, my handwriting is still Eden's. These people about me will not {{let me go to the}} bank personally. It seems, indeed, that there is no bank in this town, and that I have an account in some part of London. It seems that Elvesham kept the name of his solicitor secret from all his household. I can ascertain nothing. Elvesham was, of course, a profound student of mental science, and all my declarations of the facts of the case merely confirm the theory that my insanity is the outcome of overmuch brooding upon psychology. Dreams of the personal identity indeed! Two days ago I was a healthy youngster, with all life before me; now I am a furious old man, unkempt, and desperate, and miserable, prowling about a great, luxurious, strange house, watched, feared, and avoided as a lunatic by everyone about me.
