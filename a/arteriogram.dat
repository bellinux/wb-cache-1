The method was evaluated on 20 patient CTP scans. An observer study was performed by two radiologists, assessing the arteries and veins in <b>arteriograms</b> and venograms derived from the filtered CTP data, compared to those derived from the original data.

Meanwhile, Cameron and Chase, while breaking into his house, find that the patient has been lying about everything and that he is a Romani, and does not want to share his personal information or medical history with outsiders. After a consultation with House, Foreman tries to find a deep-vein thrombosis by carrying out an <b>arteriogram,</b> although House suggests thinning his blood and redoing the venogram. Foreman discovers his liver is failing, after which House suggests doing a CT scan, MRI, and other tests. After the MRI, they find a granuloma, and believe he has Wegener's Disease; House suggests immediate treatment since a liver biopsy to confirm Wegener's would take too long to obtain results. The treatment improved his liver, but causes a hemorrhage in his bladder, so they switch to an experimental treatment, FT28. While Foreman tries to convince his patient to take the medicine, his spleen bursts. The exchange between the patient's father and Foreman reveals that the father is comparing the experimental treatment to the Porajmos. Foreman replies citing his people's slavery. During surgery, House looks and finds there are no granulomas, so the diagnosis can not be Wegener's. House then orders a colonoscopy, at which point his team finds a toothpick stuck in his colon.

The final sample consisted of nine adult patients who were hospitalized and scheduled for arteriography (except for cerebral arteriograms).

Subjects were contacted prior to the <b>arteriogram</b> and asked to complete part of the prearteriogram questionnaire.

The subjects then completed the remainder of the prearteriogram questionnaire.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the clinical utility of CO 2 gas as an arterial contrast agent, {{the experience with}} CO 2 arteriography at the University of Florida was reviewed. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Preliminary studies have demonstrated the feasibility of CO 2 arteriography and shown that arterial injection of CO 2 gas appears non-toxic (which could limit the risks of contrast induced renal injury and allergic reaction). However, numerous technical problems make CO 2 arteriography a demanding technique and recent {{studies have suggested that}} distal lower extremity vessels are difficult to image using CO 2 arteriography, especially when significant arterial occlusive disease is present. METHODS: One hundred twenty-eight CO 2 <b>arteriograms</b> done in 115 patients were reviewed. CO 2 <b>arteriograms</b> were graded as excellent, good, poor, or inadequate by two blinded observers and results of CO 2 studies compared to results of standard contrast studies (done in 98 patients for image comparison). In addition, a therapeutic plan based on the CO 2 <b>arteriograms</b> was compared with the therapy each patient received. RESULTS: One hundred-seventeen (91 %) of the CO 2 <b>arteriograms</b> were of good or excellent quality and agreement between CO 2 studies and standard contrast studies was seen in 93 of 98 cases (95 %). Accurate therapeutic plans based on CO 2 studies were possible in 92 % of cases with inadequate visualization of infrapopliteal arteries being the major limitation (7 cases). No allergic reactions occurred and only one patient potentially had contrast-induced nephrotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: CO 2 arteriography provides accurate, clinically useful arterial imaging with minimal risk. Thus, this new technology significantly increases the utility of arteriography in patients with peripheral vascular disease...|$|R

This study prospectively evaluates combined 12 lead exercise electrocardiography and thallium- 201 scintigraphy as a screening test in patients with atypical angina in order to determine whether normal <b>arteriograms</b> are avoidable in this important subgroup of patients presenting with chest pain. Sixty seven consecutive patients with atypical angina underwent both maximal exercise testing and thallium scintigraphy before coronary arteriography.

When both tests were applied the predictive accuracy for normal coronary arteries was 96 % (54 / 56) and that for the presence of coronary disease was 82 % (9 / 11). If coronary arteriography was withheld in patients in whom both the exercise test and thallium scintigraphy were negative, the number of normal coronary <b>arteriograms</b> could be reduced with only a very small risk of failing to detect individuals with coronary disease...|$|R
