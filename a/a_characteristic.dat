5|$|Brachiopod fossils show great {{diversity}} in the morphology of the shells and lophophore, while the modern genera show less diversity but provide soft-bodied characteristics.

The phylum also has experienced significant convergent evolution and reversals (in which a more recent group seems to have lost <b>a</b> <b>characteristic</b> that is seen in an intermediate group, reverting to <b>a</b> <b>characteristic</b> last seen in an older group). Hence some brachiopod taxonomists believe it is premature to define higher levels of classification such as order, and recommend instead a bottom-up approach that identifies genera and then groups these into intermediate groups.|$|E
