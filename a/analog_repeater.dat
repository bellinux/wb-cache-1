50|$|On June 30, 2006, {{the station}} {{modified}} its call sign to KKYK-DT, {{becoming one of}} the few U.S. television stations to bear the suffix. KKYK's <b>analog</b> <b>repeater</b> on UHF channel 20 in Little Rock, had been designated as a Class A station with its call letters being modified to KKYK-CA (formerly broadcasting on channel 22, KKYK-CA was forced to move to accommodate the digital signal of ABC affiliate KATV, channel 7).|$|E
50|$|Owned by the Paxton Media Group, WPSD has studios on Television Lane in Paducah.

5000|$|On September 5, WMYG {{became a}} {{separate}} station and joined MyNetworkTV. The call letters {{stayed the same}} since they refer to the network. That station became known on-air as [...] "My 11" [...] (again referring to its cable channel slot). Meanwhile, on September 18, 2006, ABC affiliate WCJB-TV added a new second digital subchannel of its own {{to be part of}} The CW provided through The CW Plus. Eventually, WYME (a Class A <b>analog</b> <b>repeater</b> of WMYG) became a separate station and joined MeTV.|$|E
50|$|On January 27, 2016, Bell Media {{was granted}} {{approval}} by the CRTC to delete their <b>analog</b> <b>repeater</b> (CKAM-TV) in Upsalquitch, New Brunswick. Bell estimated that only 200 viewers were served by this transmitter, and had received zero complaints or questions about the proposed shut-down. To further complicate matters, the high-powered VHF transmitter cost {{a great deal to}} maintain and operate, as well being expensive on electricity, and does not bring in any revenue of its own. Since CKCW-DT would remain available on local cable and satellite providers, there would be no loss of coverage or CTV programming to the area.|$|E

50|$|This type {{is used in}} {{channels}} that transmit data {{in the form of}} an analog signal in which the voltage or current is proportional to the amplitude of the signal, as in an audio signal. They are also used in trunklines that transmit multiple signals using frequency division multiplexing (FDM). <b>Analog</b> <b>repeaters</b> are composed of a linear amplifier, and may include electronic filters to compensate for frequency and phase distortion in the line.|$|R
5000|$|KSNB and KTVG began {{broadcasting}} network programming in high-definition on January 1, 2009 {{prior to the}} broadcast of the Orange Bowl. In August 2009, KFXL became the main station for branding purposes, with all three stations being referred to as [...] "KFXL, Fox Nebraska". Despite this, KFXL-TV and the [...] "Fox Nebraska" [...] network's low-power <b>analog</b> <b>repeaters</b> received their programming from KTVG-TV. The digital subchannels of the NTV stations carrying KFXL received a direct feed from the studios in Axtell, as did KTVG.|$|R
50|$|Owned by Mission Broadcasting, WVNY is {{operated}} by Nexstar Media Group through a local marketing agreement (LMA). This makes it sister to Fox affiliate WFFF-TV {{and the two}} share studios on Mountain View Drive in Colchester, Vermont. Syndicated programming on this station includes The Office, The Dr. Oz Show, and The People's Court among others. WVNY was formerly seen on <b>analog</b> <b>repeater</b> W09BB channel 9 in Schroon Lake, New York. This station had a southeast of the town's Severance section {{and did not have}} an application to air a digital signal; its license has since been cancelled.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the analog}} era {{and some of}} the digital-only {{broadcasting}} period, it operated a repeater, W65AM on channel 65. Licensed to White River Junction, this signal had a transmitter west of Lebanon on Crafts Hill. W65AM had its license cancelled by the FCC on March 19, 2010. [...] This translator was within reach of a former <b>analog</b> <b>repeater</b> operated by sister station WMTW based in Portland, Maine. Also licensed to White River Junction, the translator was established in 2005 after WMTW moved its main transmitter from Mount Washington closer to the Greater Portland area in Maine.|$|E
50|$|At {{one point}} in time, WABI {{operated}} an <b>analog</b> <b>repeater</b> (W61AO channel 61) licensed to Calais with a transmitter in Meddybemps. The transmitter tower was shared with W57AQ channel 57 which repeated WLBZ. Until the mid-1990s, W61AO was used to feed cable systems {{across the border in}} the Canadian Maritimes. With the advent of CANCOM, however, WABI's cross-border carriage declined. It is not offered on any systems across the border today including those in St. Stephen, New Brunswick within W61AO's former signal range. Most cable systems in Atlantic Canada now carry WBZ-TV from Boston, Massachusetts for CBS programming. The W61AO license was canceled by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) at WABI's request on November 9, 2009.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, WMTW {{activated}} two <b>analog</b> <b>repeaters.</b> This included W26CQ channel 26 in Colebrook, New Hampshire (transmitter was {{northeast of}} town in Coleman State Park) and W27CP channel 27 in White River Junction, Vermont (transmitter {{was in the}} Mascoma section of Lebanon, New Hampshire) {{to make up for}} lost coverage when it signed-off from Mount Washington. Under normal conditions, these translators should have been built before WMTW moved off the mountain in order to comply with FCC regulations. However, construction was delayed almost four years because the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission had to agree to the proposed tower locations for the translators.|$|R
50|$|Access 31 (call sign ATW-31) was a free-to-air {{community}} television station based in Perth, Australia which operated between 1999 and 2008 before closing due to insolvency. The station had broadcast on UHF 31 from the ABC's television mast at Bickley in the Perth Hills. It was also available {{at certain times}} on the Westlink Network, which at the time, was broadcast via the Optus Aurora satellite service and some <b>analog</b> terrestrial <b>repeaters.</b>|$|R
30|$|The Third Generation Partnership Project's Long Term Evolution-Advanced is {{considering}} relaying for cost-effective throughput enhancement and coverage extension. While <b>analog</b> <b>repeaters</b> {{have been used}} to enhance coverage in commercial cellular networks, the use of more sophisticated fixed relays is relatively new. The main challenge faced by relay deployments in cellular systems is overcoming the extra interference added by the presence of relays. Most prior work on relaying does not consider interference, however. This paper analyzes the performance of several emerging half-duplex relay strategies in interference-limited cellular systems: one-way, two-way, and shared relays. The performance of each strategy as a function of location, sectoring, and frequency reuse are compared with localized base station coordination. One-way relaying is shown to provide modest gains over single-hop cellular networks in some regimes. Shared relaying is shown to approach the gains of local base station coordination at reduced complexity, while two-way relaying further reduces complexity but only works well when the relay is close to the handset. Frequency reuse of one, where each sector uses the same spectrum, is shown to have the highest network throughput. Simulations with realistic channel models provide performance comparisons that reveal the importance of interference mitigation in multihop cellular networks.|$|R
5000|$|The CBS {{affiliation}} brought Florida Gators football to {{the station}} through the network's rights to air Southeastern Conference football games. These games have been high ratings draws especially during the national championship years of 2006 and 2008. Corresponding with the network change, the station began broadcasting a digital signal on UHF channel 28. A second digital subchannel was established to continue a primary WB (through The WB 100+) and secondary UPN affiliation. This service used the calls [...] "WBFL" [...] in a fictional manner (to match an off-air <b>analog</b> <b>repeater</b> on VHF channel 11 which is now WMYG) and was known on-air as [...] "WB 10" [...] after the cable channel on Cox.|$|E
50|$|WBGT-CD is the Class A MyNetworkTV-affiliated {{television}} station for Rochester, New York. It broadcasts a low-powered standard definition digital signal on UHF channel 46 (or virtual channel 46 via PSIP) from a transmitter in the city's Northwest Quadrant. The station {{can also be}} seen on Charter channel 18 (hence the My 18 on-air branding). Owned by Vision Communications, WBGT-CD has studios on Buffalo Road (NY 33) in the town of Gates (with a Rochester address). Syndicated programing on the station includes Roseanne, Family Feud, The Wendy Williams Show and The Cosby Show among others. WBGT-CD was formerly also seen over-the-air on <b>analog</b> <b>repeater</b> W26BZ channel 26 in Victor, which is no longer licensed. This broadcast from a transmitter south of Perinton's Egypt hamlet along the Monroe and Ontario County line.|$|E
40|$|Conventionally, a memoryless <b>analog</b> <b>repeater</b> at {{the relay}} of a {{multihop}} transmission system amplifies the signal received from its incoming link, and retransmits the amplified signal to its outgoing link. In the frequency domain, such an amplification essentially {{is an ideal}} bandpass filtering, treating all the frequency components uniformly. For multicarrier systems like orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) over frequency-selective channels, such a frequency-flat amplification is inadequate to exploit the benefits of adaptive processing at the relay. This paper analyzes the potential performance gain of non-uniform frequency-domain relay amplification, in which the gain coefficients for subcarriers are adapted from the frequency responses of both the incoming and outgoing links. The end-to-end achievable rate optimization problem is formulated and shown to lack the desired concavity property and thus is not amenable to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker approaches like water-filling. A heuristic power allocation and relay processing algorithm is proposed, which adaptively selects and matches {{a subset of the}} subcarriers for each link, according to the realization of the link frequency responses. Numerical results show that the heuristic algorithm achieves considerable performance gains, compared to conventional amplify-and-forward relay processing without adaptive power allocation...|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{the loss}} of its full-power signal, WAZE {{remained}} on several area cable systems, {{as well as the}} Evansville DirecTV and Dish Network feeds, for over a year. Cable and satellite companies are not legally obligated to carry low-power stations. However, on January 3, 2013, the station's <b>analog</b> <b>repeaters</b> went off the air with no advance warning, leaving the Tri-State without a CW affiliate. Roberts had filed for bankruptcy protection in 2012, but did not file to renew the repeaters' licenses at the time the Evansville stations filed for renewal, meaning their licenses would have expired on August 1, 2013. [...] In a filing with the FCC, Roberts filed a temporary request to halt operations due to the bankruptcy proceedings. However, Newkirk reported that the receiving equipment had been removed from the transmitter site, making it very unlikely that WAZE would return to the air in the foreseeable future. [...] In any event, a prospective buyer would not only have to be approved by the bankruptcy court, but such approval would have had to have been granted before April 1 in order to give the new owner time to file for a license renewal. [...] The repeaters would have been forced off the air in any event if they hadn't converted to digital by 2015; as of late 2012 no conversion applications had been filed with the FCC.|$|R
