40|$|When {{economic}} capital is calculated using a portfolio model of credit value-at-risk, the marginal capital requirement for an instrument depends, in general, on {{the properties of}} the portfolio in which it is held. By contrast, ratings-based capital rules, including both the current Basel Accord and its proposed revision, assign a capital charge to an instrument based only on its own characteristics. I demonstrate that ratings-based capital rules can be reconciled with the general class of credit VaR models. Contributions to VaR are portfolio-invariant only if (a) there is only a single systematic risk factor driving correlations across oblig-ors, and (b) no exposure in a portfolio accounts for more than an arbitrarily small share of total exposure. Analysis of rates of convergence to asymptotic VaR leads to a simple and accurate portfolio-level <b>add-on</b> <b>charge</b> for undiversified idiosyncratic risk. There is no similarly simple way to address violation of the single factor assumption.

Affected customers could choose to receive either a complimentary voice mail <b>add-on</b> at no <b>charge</b> for three consecutive months, or a one-time prepaid credit.|$|R
50|$|Coral QQ, a {{modification}} of Tencent QQ, is another <b>add-on.</b> While Tencent <b>charges</b> for some services and displays advertisements, Coral QQ provides free access {{to some of the}} services and blocks Tencent's advertisements. In 2006, Tencent filed a copyright lawsuit against Chen Shoufu (aka Soff), the author of Coral QQ, after his redistributing of a modified Tencent QQ was ruled illegal. Chen then published his modification as a separate add-on. On 16 August 2007, Chen was detained again for allegedly making profits off of his ad-blocking add-on. His case is pending at Shenzhen Nanshan district court.|$|R
40|$|The German {{health care}} reform {{implemented}} in 2009 led to a considerable increase in price transparency within the statutory health insurance (SHI) (Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung, GKV) system and also made it more consumer-friendly which, in turn, has encouraged policy holders to react to price hikes by switching to a different health insurance fund ("sickness fund"). In 2009, the government established a central "health care fund" (Gesundheitsfond) which standardized contribution rates. Price differences between the sickness funds are now listed separately on the policy holder's bill as add-on or reimbursed premiums. It is above all these add-on premiums that gave policy holders a clear price signal. According to SOEP representative survey data, in 2010 this resulted in one in ten individuals affected by add-on premiums switching health plans. Aggregated sickness fund level data show that the add-on premiums introduced by the DAK and KKH-Allianz resulted in a 7. 5 percent average annual loss of members. However, {{at the beginning of}} 2011, a generous increase in the uniform contribution rate for all sickness funds and the extravagant filling of the health care fund with the additional reserves means that in 2012, it is likely that no sickness fund will have to <b>charge</b> <b>add-on</b> premiums thus thwarting any price transparency previously achieved by the add-on premiums. As of 2013 the situation could change again as a result of increasing health care spending and a downturn in the economy. However, the government should not count on this happening, and instead should introduce new incentives to strengthen price competition, for example by capping the health care fund's payments to the sickness funds.
