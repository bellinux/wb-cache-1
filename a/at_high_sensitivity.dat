40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{demonstrate}} {{the ability to}} analyze a multiple of miniaturized bus-integrated sensor elements <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>sensitivity</b> from the superimposed complex overall spectrum by individual frequency modulation of optical microring resonators (MRR) fed by a single bus waveguide. The diverse sensor elements can be coated with biochemically selective adlayers (e. g., antibody molecules) to specifically promote the accumulation of target molecules on the MRR surface. Adhesion of target molecules results in an increase of the MRR resonance frequencies which can be measured <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>sensitivity</b> with a picometer accuracy. Readout of each MRR from the complex overall spectrum is performed by using phase sensitive lock-in detection to filter out the individual and selective response to external stimuli. We fabricated test arrays with 12 MRR elements based on silicon nitride material, each element integrated with a heater electrode for thermo-optical modulation of the MRR. A clea r readout of the individual MRR by using a tuneable laser source is accomplished in a simple and reliable manner via lock-in detection despite strong overlap of the individual resonances. With our first results, we point out the large potential for multiplexed label-free detection of diverse biomolecular compounds...|$|E

5000|$|For instance, {{the noise}} level {{produced}} by a Four Thirds sensor at ISO 800 is roughly equivalent to that produced by a full frame sensor (with roughly four times the area) at ISO 3200, and that produced by a 1/2.5" [...] compact camera sensor (with roughly 1/16 the area) at ISO 100.

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{evolving}} indications for device therapy in atrial arrhythmia the accurate detection of high rate atrial events is a necessity. In a sheep model of atrial fibrillation (AF) we observed a contradictory behavior of the Thera DR pacemaker. The pacemakers were programmed to deliver burst pacing on detection of sinus rhythm (SR). Paradoxically, progressively more inappropriate bursts were delivered during AF, <b>at</b> a <b>higher</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> This implied that the pacemaker interpreted AF as SR. We assessed the atrial detection of the Thera DR, Diamond, Saphir, and Marathon pacemakers during AF, in a sheep model and in vitro using a waveform generator. By counting the annotated atrial-sensed events reported by the pacemaker we charted {{the behavior of the}} pacemakers at different <b>sensitivities.</b> <b>At</b> a <b>higher</b> <b>sensitivity</b> both the Thera DR and the Diamond paradoxically reported fewer atrial events during AF. This behavior led to inappropriate mode switching and incorrect diagnostic data collection. It could be reproduced in vitro. The Marathon did not show this paradoxical undersensing in vivo or in vitro. This paradoxical undersensing <b>at</b> a <b>high</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is dependent on the amplitude of the input signal and could not be explained by an overlap of programmable timing parameters. It is caused by ringing of the atrial sensing amplifier. <b>At</b> <b>high</b> atrial rates and a <b>high</b> <b>sensitivity</b> the ringing of the repetitive atrial signal input results in blanking of the atrial amplifier. This observation may be relevant in the device management of patients with paroxysmal AF. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background To {{investigate}} how patterns of cell differentiation {{are related to}} underlying intra- and inter-cellular signalling pathways, we use a stochastic individual-based model to simulate pattern formation when stem cells and their progeny are cultured as a monolayer. We assume that the fate of an individual cell is regulated by the signals it receives from neighbouring cells via either diffusive or juxtacrine signalling. We analyse simulated patterns using two different spatial statistical measures that are suited to planar multicellular systems: pair correlation functions (PCFs) and quadrat histograms (QHs). Results With a diffusive signalling mechanism, pattern size (revealed by PCFs) is determined by both morphogen decay rate and a sensitivity parameter that determines {{the degree to which}} morphogen biases differentiation; <b>high</b> <b>sensitivity</b> and slow decay give rise to large-scale patterns. In contrast, with juxtacrine signalling, <b>high</b> <b>sensitivity</b> produces well-defined patterns over shorter lengthscales. QHs are simpler to compute than PCFs and allow us to distinguish between random differentiation at low sensitivities and patterned states generated <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>sensitivities.</b> Conclusions PCFs and QHs together provide an effective means of characterising emergent patterns of differentiation in planar multicellular aggregates. </p...|$|R
