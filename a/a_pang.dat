500|$|At {{the age of}} 50, after {{suffering}} a very short illness, Walker died on 14 June 1886, at Pressland House, Hobart, Tasmania, with his funeral being held two days later. The Mercury wrote in its obituary on 15 June 1886: [...] "Cricketers will learn with regret of the death, after a very short illness, of Mr. William Holden Walker, {{one of the oldest}} votaries of this thoroughly English game in the colony... Mr. Walker, who previous to his departure from England, {{was a member of the}} well-known Walker Team, brought cricketing into great prominence in Launceston... His efforts in the cause of cricket are so well known that they require no comment, but his sudden demise will cause <b>a</b> <b>pang</b> among the many friends who admired his genial and gentlemanly temperament." ...|$|E
500|$|Shakespeare's {{account of}} the battle was mostly based on chroniclers Edward Hall's and Raphael Holinshed's {{dramatic}} versions of history, which were sourced from Vergil's chronicle. However, Shakespeare's attitude towards Richard was shaped by scholar Thomas More, whose writings displayed extreme bias against the Yorkist king. [...] The result of these influences is a script that vilifies the king, and Shakespeare had few qualms about departing from history to incite drama. Margaret of Anjou died in 1482, but Shakespeare had her speak to Richard's mother before the battle to foreshadow Richard's fate and fulfill the prophecy she had given in Henry VI. [...] Shakespeare exaggerated the cause of Richard's restless night before the battle, imagining it as a haunting by the ghosts of those whom the king had murdered, including Buckingham. [...] Richard is portrayed as suffering <b>a</b> <b>pang</b> of conscience, but as he speaks he regains his confidence and asserts {{that he will be}} evil, if such needed to retain his crown.|$|E

500|$|When the Beagle {{returned}} on 2 October 1836, Darwin {{was already}} a celebrity in scientific circles, as in December 1835 University of Cambridge Professor of Botany John Stevens Henslow had fostered his former pupil's reputation by giving selected naturalists a pamphlet of Darwin's geological letters. Charles Lyell eagerly met Darwin {{for the first time}} on 29 October, enthusiastic about the support this gave to his uniformitarianism, and in May wrote to John Herschel that he was [...] "very full of Darwin's new theory of Coral Islands, and have urged Whewell to make him read it at our next meeting. I must give up my volcanic crater theory for ever, though it cost me <b>a</b> <b>pang</b> at first, for it accounted for so much... the whole theory is knocked on the head, and the annular shape and central lagoon have nothing to do with volcanoes, nor even with a crateriform bottom.... Coral islands are the last efforts of drowning continents to lift their heads above water. Regions of elevation and subsidence in the ocean may be traced by the state of the coral reefs." [...] Darwin presented his findings and theory in a paper which he read to the Geological Society of London on 31 May 1837.|$|E

[...] The actress added that even though Silas has let her off this time, he could strike again.|$|E

Since he lived near the Polo Grounds and because {{he was a member of}} the PAL and CYO, he was able to attend many games for free and became a [...] "very big Giants fan". He decided, at the tender age of eight, that he wanted to become a sports announcer, fascinated as he was by football radio broadcasts.|$|E

2500|$|In 1929 {{she worked}} at Busch Circus, where she had to dance to [...] "the tragedy of my father's life and death,and be brought face to face on the stage with actors who were impersonating him and his murderers. Every time I have to confront my father on the stage <b>a</b> <b>pang</b> of poignant memory shoots through my heart, and I could break down and weep." [...] In 1932 Rasputin, My Father was published. In January 1933 she {{performed}} in Cirque d'hiver with a pony act. In December 1934 Maria was in London. In 1935 she found work in the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus, based in Peru, Indiana. The circus toured America and Maria acted one season as a lion tamer, billing herself as [...] "the daughter of the famous mad monk whose feats in Russia astonished the world." [...] She was mauled by a bear in May 1935 [...] but stayed with the circus until it reached Miami, Florida, where she quit before it ceased operations. In 1938 her two daughters were denied entry to the USA. Maria was ordered {{to leave the country}} within 90 days, but then, in March 1940, she married Gregory Bernadsky, a childhood chum and former White Russian Army officer, in Miami. In 1946 they divorced and she became a U.S. citizen. In 1947 the youngest of her daughters married in Paris Gideon Walrave Boissevain (1897-1985), ministre plénipotentiaire in Greece, Chile, Israel and the Dutch ambassador to Cuba.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} the {{supporters}} of the counter-protests have voiced suspicions regarding the purported involvement (including the alleged offering of remuneration) of influential US-based activists and think tanks in providing impetus for the demonstrations, though this remains a fringe view among scholars. Similar conspiracy theories have been espoused by figures like Biser Milanov (who did not self-identify as a counter-protester, but was believed to fit this description by protest activists), who made a statement at the Council of Ministers in August 2013, in which he affirmed that his [...] "National Liberty" [...] movement would only support the government if it took adequate measures against [...] "paid protesters", entailing granting them permission to create [...] "volunteer patrols" [...] who would operate together with police officers and apprehend [...] "all protest organizers who are driven {{by a desire to}} promote George Soros' interests in Bulgaria". Rapper Mihail Mihaylov, who has been described in the media as [...] "one of the faces of the counter-protests", has in a similar fashion expressed dismay at the alleged meddling of outside agents in Bulgarian affairs and in addition to that criticized the Borisov Government for its supposed authoritarian tendencies, thus subscribing to the argument that GERB was bound to be the beneficiary of any anti-government protests. According to research conducted by the Sofia Open Society Institute covering the months of June and July, only 7.4% of respondents cited the concern that GERB could return to the helm of the country as being among their reasons for refusing to participate in a protest. Journalist Petar Volgin, who has been noted for his anti-protest philosophy in contrast to other media anchors, echoed some of the sentiments of the conspiracy theorists, maintaining that the spontaneity of the protests only persisted until about their fifth day, after which they were taken over by a collection of interested [...] "political engineers" [...] – right-wing activists, GERB affiliates and [...] "tipping point" [...] circles with close connections to selected oligarchs. Columnists associated with the Ataka party compare the protests to the Otpor! movement as well as the various colour revolutions that are also purported to have been sponsored by pro-US activists and NGOs that are claimed to promote undesirable political correctness norms in Eastern European countries. Thus, foreign agents were deemed capable of exerting an influence of the momentum and intensity of the protests, with one of the speculations being that the government's decision to implicitly give the green light regarding the construction of a 7th unit of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant (to be commissioned to American company Westinghouse), placated the pro-American NGOs in Bulgaria and brought about a dwindling in the protest waves. During the protests and following their cessation, Volen Siderov has referred to them as [...] "an attempt to pull off a Bulgarian Maidan". He has also alleged that Oresharski had <b>a</b> <b>pang</b> of conscience and decided to resign after refusing to accede to American demands (with the insistence to abandon South Stream being the only one to be made public) put forth during a meeting with John McCain in June 2014, which included (amongst others) providing the United States with a carte blanche to use Bulgarian military airports for the purpose of military and logistical actions in light of the Ukrainian crisis as well as sending Bulgarian troops to fight against the pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine. It has been alleged that parties such as BSP encouraged their supporters to flood Internet forums with anti-protest messages (attempting to divert discussions in the direction of conspiracy theories).|$|E
