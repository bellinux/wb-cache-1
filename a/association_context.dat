However, the decision in Re Denley's Trust Deed allows for some trusts of this type to be held valid, and, accordingly, the case of Re West Sussex Constabulary's Widows, Children and Benevolent (1930) Fund Trusts applied this construction to the rights held by an unincorporated association.

We argue that GPS data contains important information about relationships between people, through location and time, and can ultimately provide ideas about their association level and activities. We propose RDF Metadata and Data Mining can discover these Semantic Associations between entities, from which further insight into past, present and future associations and activities can be determined. We visualize our findings to illustrate effectiveness and also to persuade the user of the feasibility of our system called “GPODS ” (Global Positioning Ontological Data System).

The professional association mission is not and should not be entirely derived from the enhancement of competence, the achievement of certification, or the advancement of career. This ethnographic case study was undertaken to critically examine the process by which one professional medical association educates and socializes its membership. Socialization manifests itself in the formation of a system of values, norms, and beliefs; the degree to which social consciousness emerged as part of the contextual belief system was a focal point of the study. Data collection techniques included interviewing, document analysis, and observation at conferences, workshops, and seminars over a three-year course of investigation. Data analysis approaches included phenomenological theme construction, constant comparison, and analytic induction. Themes were derived from codes of transcripts, field notes, and journals. Triangulation was achieved through comparison of role and other examples from the professional-development research literature base. Six factors that contributed to the socialization of volunteers in the professional <b>association</b> <b>context</b> were established in the literature: charismatic leadership, creation of a community, establishment of standards, development of a hierarchy, volunteer leadership development, and positive reinforcement. A structure of differentiation in levels of volunteer commitment and participation also contributed to the socialization of volunteers: dues payers, attendees, participants, and leaders. Interviewees believed that all citizens have a fundamental obligation to be socially responsible and that everyday professional practice constitutes social responsibility. However, they were unable to make explicit connection between voluntarism within their professional association and social mission. Conspicuously absent from their discussion of motivating interests was the organization's social mission. This research offers overtly bureaucratic socialization as an explanation for that deficit. As an instrument of socialization, voluntarism within the <b>association</b> <b>context</b> ensures that social responsibility remains an implicit function rather than an explicit organizational mission. Finally, metapolicy suggestions for policy makers within professional association contexts that center on formulating policy concerning the participation of volunteers are offered. Policy formation informed by adult education principles not only fosters alignment between organizational mission and personal missions held by association members but enables associations to revitalize the role of professionals in society...|$|E

The change in organizational need has led to rapidly broadened and deepened applications and marketing is nowadays seen as a management tool forsuccess. The biggest problems non-profits faces today are resource limitations, management and organisation problems. The Swedish Chamber of Commerce in France is a non-profit association in change. With the application of the commercial division and through the opening of the Business Centre in Paris the CCSF have engaged itself to be more business-oriented. A marketing project was implemented with the objective of promoting, informing and establishing a new network in Sweden. Having the responsibility of the management of this project my research question is: How is a marketing project of an organization with limited resources such as the CCSF to be conducted to promote a new commercial activity in a non-profit <b>association</b> <b>context?</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate how to conduct a marketing project in order to guide non-profit organizations with limited resources that want to commercialize their services, with the particular case of the CCSF. The theories used to fulfill the purpose in this study are mainly as a support in the construction of aproject process. The framework involves project  anagement theories, the strategic planning and the marketing theories. A qualitative approach was used opting for a deductive method since the outcomes of my study where going to be supported in my theoretical frame.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether the relationship marketing mediators of commitment trust, and satisfaction come together to comprise a global measure of relationship quality and to test if the overall measure of relationship quality is related to specific outcome measures. Originality: Similar studies have examined this type of measure in an overall relationship marketing context but this approach is less informative as it cannot consider variables that are specific to {{a particular type of}} exchange context. This measure has not previously been examined in a specific exchange context. This study will explore this type of measurement specifically in a membership <b>association</b> <b>context</b> where the type of exchange and the large number of members has a unique influence on the type and strength of the relationship. Key literature / theoretical perspective: Relationship marketing antecedents and behaviours are mediated by specific mediating variables that are well researched but not agreed upon. An alternative approach is to suggest that a combination of such mediators, as a global measure of relationship quality is a more informative measure. Design/methodology/approach: Self administered mail questionnaire analysed predominantly using structural equation modeling. Findings: Relationship quality can be measured as a second order construct consisting of trust, satisfaction and commitment. Relationship quality has significant strong relationships with word of mouth and retention and a weak significant relationship with performance. Research limitations/implications: This needs to be measured with antecedents to the relationship to explore the entire RM conceptualisation. Practical and Social implications: Results allow management to have a deeper understanding of how to generate strong relationships with members and the benefits to expect when doing so. Can subsequently develop and target specific RM strategies at achieving these goals. 2 page(s...|$|E

40|$|With the {{increasing}} availability and decreasing costs of high-throughput genotyping, contemporary genetic association studies now incorporate {{vast quantities of}} information. Major advances in genotyping technology have led to higher throughput at lower costs, and greater accuracy and completeness. These advances bring with them new questions, including 1) how to best adjust for the multiple testing problem given the likely correlation between tests involving dense markers, and 2) what levels of genotyping quality can be expected, and what levels can be tolerated in an association testing framework. 	We first {{address the issue of}} adjustment for the many tests performed, given the high levels of correlation that are typical of association studies involving dense markers. We present PACT (P-value Adjusted for Correlated Tests), an estimator analogous to Bonferroni or Sidak adjustment which accounts for the correlation between tests. We show through simulation that PACT can attain the accuracy and power of permutation tests thousands of times faster. 	We next extend our work on PACT so that it may be applied to meta-analyses involving correlated tests. We describe extensions to four common study designs, and show through simulation that these methods provide valid tests with greater power than methods which do not account for correlation. 	Finally, we investigate the nature of genotyping error and missing data for a variety of common SNP genotyping platforms in two datasets where replicate genotyping has been performed. We find that the rates of error and missingness vary depending on an individual's true genotype, and that heterozygotes and minor allele homozygotes are more prone to errors and missingness on most platforms. We show that differential rates of genotype error and missing data can invalidate the commonly used test of equal allele frequencies. We use simulation {{to assess the impact of}} the observed distribution of errors and missing data on false-positive rates in a genome-wide <b>association</b> <b>context.</b> We find that the impact varies depending on 1) whether the underlying association test is an allele frequency test, a test for trend, or a family-based association test and 2) whether appropriate quality control measures are applied...|$|E

The semantic similarity measure is proven to be very useful for many tasks in natural language processing like information retrieval, information extraction, machine translation etc. Additionally, one of the main problems in natural language processing is data sparseness since no language sample is large enough to seize all possible language combinations. In our research we experiment with four different measures of <b>association</b> with <b>context</b> and eight different measures of vector similarity.

The aim of this research is to provide a critical examination of community engagement through the development of practice and strategy of a UK housing association to deliver neighbourhood regeneration in a deprived neighbourhood in North West England. An action research approach using interlinked inquiry streams was undertaken with residents, senior managers and practitioners. The findings were used to develop community engagement strategy, articulate a model of engagement practice and enable the residents’ lived experience and views on service providers to be heard. Most literature about community {{engagement in}} regeneration is critical about the limited involvement of residents in partnerships, meetings and consultations. However, little {{attention has been paid to}} the exploration of transformative engagement where the process and outcome of engagement seeks to empower and enable self-determination of residents. This research addresses this gap and also further explores informal and creative engagement methods, the skills required for engagement practice, the role of housing associations in neighbourhood management and considerations for housing associations undertaking community engagement to achieve a lasting impact for people and place. This thesis has contributed to knowledge in two ways. The first contribution is the adaptation of Andrews and Turner’s (2006) Consumerist and Participatory Framework for the analysis of community engagement in a housing <b>association</b> <b>context.</b> The adapted framework is valuable in identifying different types of engagement approach within organisations. This framework addresses the gap in knowledge about the development of community engagement strategy. The second contribution to knowledge is the creation of a model of transformative community engagement practice, based on an extended definition of neighbourhood sustainability, the literature review and research findings. The research discusses the implications for housing associations undertaking community engagement in the current context, which is of particular relevance given the impact of UK public sector cuts and welfare benefit changes to poorer communities. Findings can be transferred to other housing providers or agencies looking to engage residents to achieve sustainable outcomes that will improve their lives and local neighbourhoods...|$|E
40|$|The most {{important}} information conveyed by language is often contained {{not in the}} utterance itself, but in {{the interaction between the}} utterance and the comprehender's knowledge {{of the world and the}} current situation. This dissertation uses psycholinguistic methods to explore the effects of a common type of inference - causal inference - on language comprehension. In 8 experiments, I investigate the effects of causal inference on the neuro-cognitive processes that occur during word processing (Experiments 1 - 5) and the hemispheric basis of these processing effects (Experiments 6 - 8). The goal of Experiments 1 - 3 was to compare competing theoretical frameworks of language processing with respect to the ordering of "high-level" (causal inferential) and "low-level" (lexical <b>association)</b> <b>context</b> effects on word processing. To that end, participants listened to two-sentence short stories encouraging a causal inference, each followed by a probe word related to some aspect of the context story. ERP results showed that causal information affected word processing earlier than lexical associative information, and that lexical association effects were suppressed in discourse contexts. These results supported dynamic processing theories of the kind inspired by simple recurrent networks. Experiments 4 and 5 tested the impact of causal relatedness on multiple, semi-redundant discourse cues embedded in sentences. This study investigated whether causal inferences build up over time across several words, or if a full-fledged inference can be activated in response to a single critical word. Results indicated that different participants activated inferences in qualitatively different ways. Some showed evidence of predictive inference, while others showed evidence of a drawn-out inference activation process covering several cues to discourse implausibility. These results reflect individual differences in inference activation that are unrelated to common metrics of processing ability. Experiments 6 - 8 tested the hypothesis of a right hemisphere (RH) advantage for activating causal inferences. Results indicated that neither hemisphere had a processing advantage for causal related information, although left hemisphere (LH) experienced facilitated processing for strong lexical associations. This finding suggests causal inference processing is balanced between the two hemispheres, and that causal inference deficits in RH lesion patients are related to a dominant LH tendency to focus on local semantic relationship...|$|E
40|$|Dissertação de mestrado em Ciências da Educação (área de especialização em Administração Educacional) O presente trabalho pretende contribuir para o conhecimento da problemática da Cultura Organizacional no contexto associativo. O nosso desafio consistiu na exploração de algumas das principais investigações {{realizadas}} sobre esta problemática, tendo por base os principais especialistas na área. Sabíamos que, relativamente ao contexto associativo, no nosso país, existia uma escassez de trabalhos sobre as dimensões culturais das associações. Assim, o nosso propósito passou igualmente por despertar a atenção e o interesse pelas manifestações simbólicas desenvolvidas nas instituições de cariz associativo. Esta dissertação pretende reflectir sobre as especificidades culturais mais relevantes de uma Associação, perceber e discutir as regularidades e as dinâmicas ao longo da sua vida, dando destaque aos principais momentos e contextos de afirmação na comunidade. Caracterizar a Cultura Organizacional ao nível das manifestações, destacar os factores mais importantes que intervêm e condicionam o desenvolvimento da instituição, constituíram também objectivos deste trabalho. Assim sendo, esta dissertação estrutura-se em duas partes, sendo a primeira constituída pelo primeiro e segundo capítulo, onde se desenvolve todo o enquadramento teórico do estudo. No primeiro capítulo procuramos realizar uma abordagem à problemática da Cultura Organizacional, nomeadamente à sua génese e desenvolvimento. Procedemos a uma apresentação de concepções teóricas de forma a clarificar o sentido de Cultura Organizacional, que se apresenta como algo bastante complexo e multifacetado. Analisamos os dois pólos de análise da Cultura Organizacional: as focalizações teóricas e as manifestações. E, por último procuramos compreender o papel da liderança na construção da cultura de uma organização. O segundo capítulo, incide sobre a Cultura Organizacional no contexto associativo, procurando percorrer a expansão desta problemática ao nível dos diferentes contextos de investigação, levando-a até ao contexto associativo. Neste ponto procura-se evidenciar as políticas internacionais e nacionais que enquadram o desenvolvimento das associações, dando destaque às dimensões educativas deste contexto. No término, apresenta-se os estilos de liderança preconizados nas diversas organizações. A segunda parte (composta pelo terceiro e quarto capítulos) é dedicada à parte empírica, à apresentação e tratamento dos dados. Optámos por uma metodologia de tipo qualitativa, recorrendo a um estudo de caso de observação. Como técnicas de recolha de dados utilizámos a observação não participante, as entrevistas semidirigidas, a análise documental e as conversas informais. Os resultados obtidos apontam no sentido de que as dimensões da liderança desempenham um papel determinante na construção da identidade da organização, sendo que “sentimos” que as realidades desta organização estão condicionadas pelo tipo de liderança que apresenta. Da mesma forma, os valores e crenças transmitidos aos seus membros (pela liderança) também influenciam a construção dessa mesma identidade. De igual modo, apercebemonos que, nesta organização especificamente (embora, cremos que noutras também, do mesmo tipo), o papel da comunidade é basilar, uma vez que interfere directamente em todo o desenvolvimento da cultura. Por último, apesar de este tipo de organização apresentar uma certa autonomia para a sua prática educativa, começa-se a desenhar a pressão e limitações por parte Estado, a este tipo de organizações do chamado Terceiro Sector, nomeadamente com o processo de certificação das respostas sociais, que são tuteladas pelo Estado. The present work {{intends to}} contribute to the knowledge of the problem that involves the Organizational Culture in an associativism context. Our challenge consisted in studying some of the main investigations carried out so far about this issue, having as background the main experts on this topic. We knew that, what comes to the associativism context, {{there are only a few}} studys done so far in our country about the cultural dimentions of associations. So, our purpose is also to attract the attentions and interest to all this kind of symbolic demonstrations developed in institutions that involve an associative purpose. This essay intends to think about the most relevant cultural specificities of an association, to realize and to discuss what happens more frequently and all the dynamics involved in the process along its life, giving special attention to its higher moments and to the contexts that involves the connection between institution and the surrounding community. We also wanted to study the Organization Culture at the level of the demonstrations and to highlight the most important factors that are behind the development of an institution. So, this essay is structured in two poles of analysis in the first part we have the first and second chapter, in which we explore all the theoretical study. In the first chapter we try to go through the expansion of this problematic of the Organizational Culture more precisely what involves its origin and consequent development. We try to show some of the theoretical concepts, so we can clarify the sense of Organizational Culture that appears to be quite complex and multifaceted. We have studied two points of analisys of the Organizational Culture: the theoretical actions or theoretical focusing and its demonstrations. At last, we wanted to understand the rolle of leadership in the construction of an organization´s culture. The second chapter is about the Organizational Culture in an <b>association</b> <b>context,</b> trying to go through the expansion of this problematic to the different levels of the context of this study. At this point we wish to highlight both national and international politics that involves the development of associations, giving special attention to the educative dimentions. At the end, its showed the different styles of leadership that exists in different organizations. In the second part (that involves the third and fourth chapters) is dedicated to the empiric level, so as the presentation and interpretation of data. We choose for a qualitative kind of method, having as background the study of a case that we have accomplished. The techniques we used to collect data were non-participating observation, semi-guided interviews documental analysis and informal conversations. The results point out to the importance of the leadership´s dimentions that have an important and determinant rolle in the construction of the identity of an organization. We became aware that certain realities of this particular organization were closely connected and influenced by the kind of leadership that exists in this organization. In the same way, the values and believes passed on to its members (by leadership) also influenced the building of this same identity. By the same way, we realized that in this particular organization, although we belief that in the others similar to this one happens the same, the role of the community is very important, because it interfears directly with the development of the culture. Although this kind of organizations seems to have a certain autonomy in what concerns to its educative project, it starts to appear that this organizations are being pressioned and limited by some government politics. We are referring to organizations from the so called third sector, specifically the ones that are working in their certification process, organizations that exists to give social responses to the involving community and are overviewed by the government. This institutions are being influenced on its internal functions and educative projects by some of the government guidelines, and that sometimes interfere with the identity of an organization...|$|E

Thus, auditory experience elicited by product sounds may not be just about the act of hearing or a sensory response to an acoustical stimulus (e. g., this is a loud and sharp sound). A complimentary and meaningful relationship exists between a product and its sounds. The bases for this complimentary relationship {{is the focus of}} this thesis. In other words, meaningful associations of product sounds are investigated from a human perspective. Empirical findings indicate that sound is regarded as an integral property of a product. Thus product, as the sound source, determines the majority of the meaningful <b>associations.</b> <b>Context,</b> in which a product is presented, also influences meaning attribution. The result of the meaning attribution is often a product label, a description of an event, or determining the purpose of the sound.

Experiment 1 investigated whether strengthening the CS–acquisition <b>context</b> <b>association</b> enhances extinction by determining whether stronger extinction is observed when CS-alone trials (i. e., extinction treatment) are administered in the acquisition context (AAC renewal), relative to a context that is neutral {{with respect to the}} US (ABC renewal). Less recovery of responding to the CS was observed in the former than in the latter case, extending the finding that AAC renewal is weaker than ABC renewal to our lick suppression preparation. Experiment 2 assessed the contribution of the acquisition context–US association to extinction of a CS by examining the effect of postextinction exposure to the acquisition context on responding to the extinguished CS. This manipulation enhanced responding to the extinguished CS in AAC, but not ABC, renewal. Experiment 3 addressed the contribution of the CS–acquisition <b>context</b> <b>association</b> by examining the potential of a neutral stimulus, presented in compound with the target CS during extinction treatment, to overshadow the CS–acquisition <b>context</b> <b>association.</b> This manipulation enhanced responding to the extinguished CS inAAC, but not ABC, renewal. The results stress the important role of contextual association in extinction and renewal. National Institute of Mental Health Grant 3388...|$|R
40|$|Fear memory enhances {{connectivity}} in cortical and limbic circuits {{but whether}} treatments disrupting fear reset connectivity to pre-trauma level is unknown. Here {{we report that}} C 56 BL/ 6 J mice exposed to a tone-shock <b>association</b> in <b>context</b> A (conditioning), and briefly re-exposed to the same tone-shock <b>association</b> in <b>context</b> B (reactivation), exhibit strong freezing to the tone alone delivered 48 h later in context B (long term fear memory). This intense fear response {{is associated with a}} massive increase in dendritic spines and phospho-Erk (p-ERK) signalling in basolateral amygdala (BLA) but neurons. We then show that propranolol (a central/peripheral β-adrenergic receptor blocker) administered before, but not after, the reactivation trial attenuates long term fear memory assessed drug free 48 h later, and completely prevents the increase in spines and p-ERK signalling in BLA neurons. An increase in spines, but not of p-ERK, was also detected in the dorsal hippocampus (DH) of the conditioned mice. DH spines, however, were unaffected by propranolol suggesting their independence from the ERK/β-ARs cascade. We conclude that propranolol selectively blocks dendritic spines and p-ERK signalling enhancement in the BLA; its effect on fear memory is, however, less pronounced suggesting that the persistence of spines at other brain sites decreases the sensitivity of the fear memory trace to treatments selectively targeting β-ARs in the BLA...|$|R
40|$|In appetitive Pavlovian learning, animals {{learn to}} {{associate}} discrete cues or environmental contexts with rewarding outcomes, and these cues and/or contexts can potentiate an ongoing instrumental response for reward. Although anatomical substrates underlying cued and contextual learning have been proposed, it remains unknown whether specific molecular signaling pathways within the striatum underlie {{one form of}} learning or the other. Here, we show that while the striatum-enriched isoform of adenylyl cyclase (AC 5) is required for cued appetitive Pavlovian learning, it is not required for contextual appetitive learning. Mice lacking AC 5 (AC 5 KO) could not learn an appetitive Pavlovian learning task in which a discrete signal light predicted reward delivery, yet they could form <b>associations</b> between <b>context</b> and either natural or drug reward, which could in turn elicit Pavlovian approach behavior. However, unlike wild-type (WT) mice, AC 5 KO mice could not use these Pavlovian conditioned stimuli to potentiate ongoing instrumental behavior in a Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer paradigm. These data suggest that AC 5 is specifically required for learning associations between discrete cues and outcomes in which the temporal relationship between conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (US) is essential, while alternative signaling mechanisms may underlie the formation of <b>associations</b> between <b>context</b> and reward. In addition, loss of AC 5 compromises the ability of both contextual and discrete cues to modulate instrumental behavior...|$|R
