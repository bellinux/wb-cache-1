5|$|The {{first three}} P.1127s crashed, {{the second and}} third {{occurring}} during development. In 1963, the first prototype, XP831, publicly crashed at the Paris Air Show; the accident had been caused by <b>a</b> <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> dirt in the air feed lines of the nozzle control motor, which had caused the engine nozzles to stick. XP831 was later fully repaired and resumed development flying. All the pilots involved survived.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, {{part of the}} {{painting}} was damaged when a vandal threw acid at it. On 30 December of that year, a rock was thrown at {{the painting}}, dislodging <b>a</b> <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> pigment near the left elbow, later restored.|$|E
25|$|The {{neatness}} of his attire {{was almost}} incredible; I believe <b>a</b> <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> dust {{would have caused}} him more pain than a bullet wound. Yet this quaint dandified little man who, I was sorry to see, now limped badly, {{had been in his}} time one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police.|$|E
60|$|At length, towards morning, <b>a</b> small <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> {{light was}} noticed on the weather-beam. It flickered for a moment, and then disappeared.|$|R

25|$|Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci {{has long}} been {{attracting}} vandals and is currently one of the best-protected artworks. In 1956, {{the lower part of}} the painting was severely damaged when a vandal doused the painting with acid while it was on display at a museum in Montauban, France. On 30 December of the same year, a young Bolivian named Ugo Ungaza Villegas threw a rock at the painting; this resulted in the loss of <b>a</b> <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> pigment near the left elbow, which was later painted over.|$|E
500|$|Keynes {{sometimes}} {{explained the}} mass murder {{that took place}} during the first years of communist Russia on a racial basis, as part of the [...] "Russian and Jewish nature", rather than {{as a result of the}} communist rule. After a trip to Russia, he wrote in his Short View of Russia that there is [...] "beastliness on the Russian and Jewish natures when, as now, they are allied together". He also wrote that [...] "out of the cruelty and stupidity of the Old Russia nothing could ever emerge, but (...) beneath the cruelty and stupidity of the New Russia <b>a</b> <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> the ideal may lie hid", which together with other comments may be construed as anti-Russian and antisemitic.|$|E
2500|$|... (1977). Nine-minute film. US Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), made by Charles and Ray Eames. [...] "An {{adventure}} in magnitudes. Starting {{at a picnic}} by the lakeside in Chicago, this film transports the viewer to the outer edges of the universe. Every ten seconds we view the starting point from ten times farther out until our own galaxy is visible only as <b>a</b> <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> light among many others. Returning to Earth with breathtaking speed, we move inward - into {{the hand of the}} sleeping picnicker - with ten times more magnification every ten seconds. Our journey ends inside a proton of a carbon atom within a DNA molecule in a white blood cell." ...|$|E
60|$|So, {{when no one}} was looking, Tommy Trout {{slipped out}} of the safe little pool where all the other little Trouts were playing. He swam just <b>a</b> little <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ways farther still. Now he could see almost around the Big Rock. Then he swam just <b>a</b> little <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ways farther and--oh dear, dear! he looked right into the mouth of a great big, big fish called Mr. Pickerel, who is very fond of little Trouts and would like to eat one for breakfast every day.|$|R

Perfectly barren. Up hill and down dale and across Waddies we go. Clouds of dust inconceivable. So dense that you instinctively close on {{the man in front}} of you in order not to lose sight of him. Could not see your own feet, or where you were putting them down. That was the worst ... a man was just discernible at ten paces by peering. In the dust go camels, pack mules, limbers, wagons, artillery, and all the rattling paraphernalia of War." ...|$|E
2500|$|The North British Review {{reflected}} evangelical Presbyterian {{willingness to}} consider science {{in relation to}} [...] "Reason and not to Faith" [...] and to view natural law as directly guided by God, but warned that [...] "If it has been revealed to man that the Almighty made {{him out of the}} dust of the earth, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, it is in vain to tell a Christian that man was originally <b>a</b> <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> albumen, and passed through the stages of monads and monkeys, before he attained his present intellectual pre-eminence." [...] Many women admired the book, and [...] "It would augur ill for the rising generation if the mothers of England were infected with the errors of Phrenology: it would augur worse were they tainted with materialism." ...|$|E

60|$|Poirot seized his hat, gave {{a ferocious}} twist to his moustache, and, {{carefully}} brushing <b>an</b> imaginary <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> dust from his sleeve, motioned me to precede {{him down the}} stairs; there we joined the detectives and set out for Styles.|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} Arnold was {{composed}} {{enough to look}} round him, the chaise had taken the curve in the road which wound behind the farmhouse.

60|$|<b>A</b> <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> eager {{fire from}} foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze after an instant. No: better not: another time.|$|E

5000|$|Here Coblentz quotes Murray Gell-Mann: “It is {{difficult}} to imagine that a handful of residents of a small planet circling an insignificant star in a small galaxy have as their aim a complete understanding of the entire universe, <b>a</b> small <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> creation truly believing it is capable of comprehending the whole.” ...|$|R

50|$|When {{a silver}} halide crystal {{is exposed to}} light, <b>a</b> {{sensitivity}} <b>speck</b> {{on the surface of}} the crystal is turned into <b>a</b> small <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> metallic silver (these comprise the invisible or latent image). If the <b>speck</b> <b>of</b> silver contains approximately four or more atoms, it is rendered developable - meaning that it can undergo development which turns the entire crystal into metallic silver. Areas of the emulsion receiving larger amounts of light (reflected from a subject being photographed, for example) undergo the greatest development and therefore results in the highest optical density.|$|R
