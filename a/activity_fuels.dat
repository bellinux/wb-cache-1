5000|$|Kamarinskaya {{is based}} on two melodies. The first is a bridal song, [...] "Izza gor" [...] (From beyond the mountains). The second, the title song of the piece, is a naigrïsh, an {{instrumental}} dance to an ostinato melody repeated {{for as long as}} the dancers can keep up with it. Glinka uses the principle from folk song of allowing the musical structure to unfold around a thematic constant—or actually two constants, since he uses two folk songs. He varies the background material surrounding these songs more than the songs themselves—orchestral color (timbre), harmonization, counterpoint. This way, Glinka preserves the original character of the dance, complementing it with creative variations in the orchestral treatment. [...] Ideally, the themes in a Western piece interact, contrast and change. This <b>activity</b> <b>fuels</b> the composition's growth as an organic creation. Tension continues building as this thematic dialogue becomes increasingly complex. This dialogue or interchange eventually propels the piece to a climactic point of resolution. Kamarinskaya does not follow this pattern. Nor can it. The ostinato melody of the second song will not allow any motivic development without distorting the character of the piece. The music repeats itself constantly, albeit with changing backgrounds. Because of this lack of thematic growth, the music remains static, not moving forward. Nor was this a unique problem with Kamarinskaya. Russian music, especially Russian folk music, stubbornly refused to follow the Western principles Tchaikovsky had learned in St. Petersburg. This may have been one reason his teacher Anton Rubinstein did not consider folk songs to be viable musical material for anything other than local color.|$|E

An increase in the internationalization indicator of ten percent increases tax revenue by over three percent. This counterintuitive result may be explained by higher tax avoidance activity of purely national firms or by legal provisions in the tax law which can be used as tax loopholes in the case of domestic transactions as opposed to cross-border transactions...|$|E

30|$|Although fire {{of higher}} {{intensity}} and severity {{may be important}} for successful aspen regeneration, localized high heat loads associated with long flame residence times appear to have occurred at some sites (e.g., BUT) where large logs were present and probably contributed to lower post-fire aspen regeneration. We observed that, where fire consumed the duff layer, aspen roots were exposed, burned, and killed, and thus were unable to regenerate post-fire; whereas, areas within the same transect (< 10 m apart) with intact duff had successful aspen regeneration. This could not be observed or quantified for the older burns, so we could not analyze this systematically. However, on the adjacent Lassen National Forest, Jones et al. (2005) observed a similar absence of post-fire aspen regeneration in areas where slash piles were burned, possibly because the fire intensity and residence time killed the aspen roots. In declining, small aspen groves with heavy fuel loading, mechanical treatment (including removal of <b>activity</b> <b>fuels)</b> may be beneficial prior to burning, and regeneration may need initial protection from browse until stems reach heights of greater than 150 cm.|$|E
40|$|Proceedings Paper (for Acquisition Research Program) Federal Government {{agencies}} convert in-house {{positions to}} contractor positions via the A- 76 process {{in order to}} save money. During an A- 76 conversion, stable future labor cost growth is assumed. This assumption is faulty in cases wherein the contractor workforce subsequently unionizes. Unionization may lead to unanticipated increases in cost, threatening the savings projected during the A- 76 process. This study seeks to: 1) compare the rate of labor-cost growth for military, civilian, and contract employees and 2) compare current labor costs for a sample outsourced <b>activity</b> (<b>fuels)</b> to labor costs for the military requirement based on manpower standards. The study finds that overall, annual collective bargaining agreement (CBA) wages increases were typically 1 - 2 % higher than Service Contract Act (SCA) wages increases. However, we found no evidence that contractors performed functions in our sample functional area at a higher cost than in-house. The actual cost of contractors averaged ~ 40 % less than the cost derived from the military manpower standard. The actual in-house cost averaged over 20 % higher than the cost derived from the manpower standard.

30|$|While {{commercial}} timber extraction {{is often}} seen as the primary economic driver behind management projects, managers attempt to avoid public controversy by framing project proposals around more laudable pursuits, such as hazardous fuels reduction. For example, the purpose and need governing several recent fuelbreak timber sales has been canopy fuel reduction {{in order to reduce}} crown fire hazard. Not coincidentally, reducing canopy fuels involves cutting down overstory trees. Typically {{the first order of business}} in these projects is to remove the large-diameter boles—the least flammable but most commercially valuable portion of a tree. This in turn involves moving the most flammable components—the small-diameter limbs and foliage—from the canopy layer directly onto the ground surface. In such cases, one could argue that the net result is not fuels reduction, but rather, fuels relocation, essentially shifting the location of hazardous fuels from the crown to the ground where they become immediately available for surface fires. If these <b>activity</b> <b>fuels</b> are left untreated or are ineffectively treated, fire intensity and severity can actually increase compared to untreated sites (Graham et al 1999, Weatherspoon 1996). Such fuels projects would not create a functional fuelbreak, for even if an independent crown fire drops to the ground, fireline intensity may still be too high to safely and effectively stage firefighters inside the fuelbreak.|$|E

The attached vicinity map shows {{the location of the}} project on the Pomeroy Ranger District. The Forest Service proposes implementing this project in 2006. Proposed activities are outside the boundary of Willow Springs inventoried roadless area, Pataha Research Natural Area, and any congressionally designated areas, such as wilderness. Three alternatives, including the No Action alternative, were analyzed in the DEIS. Alternative A is the No Action alternative. Alternative B, the proposed action and preferred alternative, would salvage harvest dead and dying trees on 9, 432 acres, and remove danger trees along haul routes, open forest routes and developed recreation sites, and administrative sites. Alternative C is designed to remove danger trees and salvage harvest primarily dead trees on 4, 188 acres where fire effects were obviously severe enough to kill 90 percent of trees, along with incidental amounts (less than 10 percent) of trees with visible green needles, within a unit. Both action alternatives (B and C) include Forest Plan amendments. The Forest Plan would be amended, for this site-specific project, to incorporate objectives, standards, and guidelines for Canada lynx, and would be amended to allocate new C 1 -Dedicated Old Growth areas to replace C 1 areas changed by the fire and no longer functioning as old growth.

30|$|The {{combination}} of thinning and burning {{is clearly the}} most effective at sustaining low crown fire potential in light of post-treatment growth and subsequent disturbance. The 2016 thin+burn was superior to the burn-only and thin-only treatments for three main reasons. First, it reduced surface and canopy fuels. Combined thinning and burning most effectively reduces fuels because thinning removes substantial tree and canopy biomass, while burning consumes surface fuels that have built up prior to thinning in addition to <b>activity</b> <b>fuels</b> (Stephens and Moghaddas 2005). Second, thin+burn reduced MPB-caused mortality relative to control and burn-only. Although thinning during outbreak-level disturbances may be ineffective (Six et al. 2014), thinning prior to an outbreak {{has been shown to}} moderate mortality (Fettig et al. 2014, Jenkins et al. 2014, Hood et al. 2016). Third, the thin+burn dampened development of ladder fuels by killing regeneration and potential ingrowth present after commercial thinning. Keyes and O’Hara (2002) identified that fuel treatments stimulate forest regeneration, and in turn negate fuel reduction objectives. Although thin+burn units are in fact regenerating, the {{combination of}} these treatments killed advanced regeneration and reset an understory development phase, lengthening the duration of treatment effectiveness. The recent divergence from thin-only emphasizes that treating the understory is imperative for extending the duration of treatment longevity. Although stand densities in both thin-only and thin+burn were most similar to stand densities in local historical units with intact frequent fire regimes (e.g., per Clyatt et al. 2016), without re-entry or burning, the thin-only treatment {{may not be able to}} resist crown fire like the thin+burn or historical, open ponderosa pine units (Arno et al. 2008). Although the thin+burn treatment had slightly greater MPB-caused mortality than thin-only, fuel treatments in ponderosa pine forest types that include both thinning and burning (i.e., because burning treated the understory) best establish forest structure that is able to resist both beetles and crown fire well into the second decade. This timeframe is especially important for ponderosa pine forests in the inland Northwest, where fire return intervals may range up to half a century (Arno et al. 1995) and managers may be financially or logistically unable to keep up fuel treatments.|$|E
40|$|Biofilms are layered {{structures}} of microbial cells and an extracellular matrix of polymeric substances, associated with surfaces and interfaces. Biofilms trap nutrients for {{growth of the}} enclosed microbial community and help prevent detachment of cells from surfaces in flowing systems. Phototrophic biofilms can best be defined as surface attached microbial communities mainly driven by light as the energy source with a photosynthesizing component clearly present. Eukaryotic algae and cyanobacteria generate energy and reduce carbon dioxide, providing organic substrates and oxygen. The photosynthetic <b>activity</b> <b>fuels</b> processes and conversions in the total biofilm community, including the heterotrophic fraction. This thesis starts with a brief introduction in the ecology of phototrophic biofilms and discusses their actual and potential applications in wastewater treatment, bioremediation, fish-feed production, biohydrogen production, and soil improvement and their role in biofouling. The next chapter describes the diversity of phototrophic bacteria in hot spring microbial mats found {{on the east coast}} of Greenland. In this study we utilized a polyphasic approach using a combination of isolation techniques, microscopic observation of morphological features, and cultivation-independent molecular methods. We observed a relationship between the cyanobacterial community composition and the in situ temperatures of different microbial mat parts. Chapter 4 focuses on the successional changes in community composition of freshwater phototrophic biofilms growing under different light intensities. Our results suggest that surface colonization by heterotrophic pioneers facilitates the development of phototrophic biofilms. In Chapter 5 we compared the community composition of phototrophic biofilms cultivated in three microcosm systems operated under identical conditions but placed in different laboratories. Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of both 16 S and 18 S rRNA gene fragments showed that the communities developed differently in terms of species richness and community composition. Chapter 6 demonstrates that nifD gene sequences, coding for a nitrogenase subunit, can be used to detect and identify diazotrophic cyanobacteria in natural communities. PCR products generated using primers homologous to conserved regions in the cyanobacterial nifD genes were subjected to DGGE and clone library analysis {{in order to determine the}} genetic diversity of diazotrophic cyanobacteria in environmental samples. In the last chapter we describe the development of PCR primers targeting conserved regions within the cyanobacterial hupS gene family. This gene is involved in the hydrogen metabolism of diazotrophic microorganisms. We analyzed hupS diversity and transcription in cultivated phototrophic biofilms by the direct retrieval and analysis of mRNA that was reverse transcribed, amplified with hupS specific primers, and cloned. Overall, the community composition and species richness of phototrophic biofilms was shown to be highly variable. Cultivation-independent molecular methods proved very useful to study diversity and function in phototrophic biofilms. Applied Science...|$|E
