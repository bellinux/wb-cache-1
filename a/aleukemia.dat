25|$|Some leukemia {{patients}} {{do not have}} high {{white blood cell counts}} visible during a regular blood count. This less-common condition is called <b>aleukemia.</b> The bone marrow still contains cancerous white blood cells which disrupt the normal production of blood cells, but they remain in the marrow instead of entering the bloodstream, where they would be visible in a blood test. For an aleukemic patient, the white blood cell counts in the bloodstream can be normal or low. <b>Aleukemia</b> can occur in any of the four major types of leukemia, and is particularly common in hairy cell leukemia.|$|E

Alternative explanations for the low CD4 counts include conditions such as blood cancers (<b>aleukemia),</b> treatment with chemotherapy, immunosuppressive medications, or other medications that suppress or kill T cells, infections, and problems with blood production.|$|E
