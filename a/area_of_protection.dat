40|$|<b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> {{minority}} shareholders after recodification of Czech private law The {{purpose of this}} thesis is to concentrate upon chosen <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> {{minority shareholders}}, analyse them and review {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the recodification of Czech private law in these areas. Simultaneously the thesis evaluates the usability of the existing judicial decisions and outlines possible development of the legislation. In the parts of the thesis where the author believes it is useful, the thesis compares these areas with foreign legislation and doctrine. The thesis is systematically composed of 4 chapters. The introductory part of the thesis consists of two separate chapters that describe the notions of minority and qualified shareholder and explain the reasons <b>of</b> their <b>protection.</b> After the definition <b>of</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> minority shareholders, chapter three concentrates on the <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> the <b>protection</b> that the author considers significant in terms of position of the minority shareholder in the company after the recodification.

50|$|The direct {{role of the}} European Union (and {{also the}} law of the EU/EC) in the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> of {{national}} minorities is still very limited (likewise the general protection of human rights).

But the “de-economisation of European integration”, which started in the 1990s, is changing this situation. The political relevance of national minorities' protection is very high.|$|E

The largest and most significant <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> and habitat for the monkey is in Jozani National Park, which provides 25 km2 of land reserve.

[...] In these shambas adjacent to the park, higher densities of the red colobus have been reported living here in more cohesive groups, compared to inside the park reserve. The incidence of some of these monkeys living permanently outside the zone of the protected park reserve can increase the endangerment of the groups.|$|E

Also, any further development of the Wekepeke Aquifer, from residential septic systems and farming or from commercial operations, could affect the town of Lancaster's well near the North Nashua River.

50|$|According to the {{modulated}} parasystole hypothesis, rigid constancy of a pacemaker {{might be}} expected if the entrance block were complete, {{but if there is}} an escape route available for the emergence of ectopic activity, then clearly there must be an effective ionic communication, not complete insulation, between the two tissues. If there is an electricalcommunication between the two, then the depolarization of the surrounding ventricle may influence the ectopic pacemaker. That influence will be electrotonic; depolarization of the surrounding field will induce a partial depolarizationof the pacemaker cells. Therefore, appropriate diagnosis of modulated parasystole relies upon the construction of a “phase response curve” as theoretical evidence of modulation of the ectopic pacemaker cycle length by the electrotonic activity generated by the sinus discharges across the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>protection.</b> In this case, the timing of the arrival of the electronic stimulus will serve to delay or advance the subsequent pacemaker activation. In this case, the coupling intervals between the manifest ectopic and sinus discharges will be either fixed or variable, depending on the cycle length relations between the two pacemakers.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{secondary}} school students' awareness <b>of</b> the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> civil <b>protection</b> in the Central Bohemian Region was investigated. Every single {{person should be}} involved in individual <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> civil <b>protection,</b> taking into account the person's age. Every person is regularly exposed to extraordinary events of various types. Therefore, it is of primary importance to know how to behave under given circumstances. Thus, such an extraordinary event can be solved better and any negative consequences can be minimized. The best start is to familiarize children in kindergartens with the given issues appropriately, continue with pupils at elementary schools and deepen the information further with students at {{secondary school}}s. However, these days there is no regular training in the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> civil <b>protection</b> at secondary schools. Students today are, therefore, reliant upon one-time lectures or their own search for the required information. The theoretical part of the thesis focuses on civil protection and its brief history in the Czech Republic as well as in foreign countries. The Concept <b>of</b> Civil <b>Protection</b> until 2020 with a View until 2030 is detailed herein. Furthermore, the current system of preventive educational activities and training at secondary schools is described herein. It is followed by definitions of several terms related to the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> civil <b>protection</b> (extraordinary event, emergency, integrated rescue system, warning and notification, evacuation, survival of citizens under emergency circumstances, individual <b>protection,</b> sheltering <b>of</b> citizens). The theoretical part of the thesis also includes the description of the fundamental methods of descriptive and mathematical statistics, which are applied in the subsequent chapter. The aim of the thesis consists in assessing the awareness of secondary school students in the Central Bohemian Region <b>of</b> the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> civil <b>protection</b> and in increasing their knowledge about the given issues. Two hypotheses were laid down: Hypothesis No. 1 : The knowledge of secondary school students about the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> civil <b>protection</b> in the Central Bohemian Region is distributed normally.
