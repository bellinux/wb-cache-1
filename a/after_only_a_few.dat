He served as legal counsel for Paul Hornung when Hornung was suspended for the 1963 National Football League season for gambling. <b>After</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years, Brown left his father's law firm and began a career in business.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 an Austrian chemist Auer von Welsbach {{developed}} the Oslamp with a filament made of osmium, which he introduced commercially in 1902. <b>After</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years, osmium {{was replaced by}} the more stable metal tungsten. Tungsten has the highest melting point among all metals, and its use in light bulbs increases the luminous efficacy and life of incandescent lamps.|$|E
5|$|<b>After</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> Segunda División matches, Pablo {{received}} his first call-up to the Spanish under-21 team, for a friendly match against Bulgaria on 19 November 2002. Despite the media's assumption {{that he would}} be among the substitutes, he played the whole match as Spain won 7–1. He was a regular selection over the next 12 months, and finished his under-21 career with ten caps. His last appearances came as Spain were eliminated by Sweden in the qualification play-offs for the 2004 European Under-21 Championships.|$|E

5|$|At age twenty-seven, {{he entered}} the Monastery of Stoudios, giving his life over {{completely}} to discipleship to his teacher Symeon the Studite. The elder Symeon was not an ordained priest, but a simple monk who was considered holy by many people. The younger Symeon was extremely zealous in his practices and in following his teacher—to {{such an extent that}} the abbot of the monastery insisted that Symeon leave <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months.|$|E
5|$|Dirty Dancing has {{appeared}} in other forms than the stage version. In 1988, a music tour named Dirty Dancing: Live in Concert, featuring Bill Medley and Eric Carmen, played 90 cities in three months. Also in 1988, the CBS network launched a Dirty Dancing television series, however {{with none of the}} original cast or staff. The series was canceled <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> episodes.|$|E
5|$|Priestley {{founded the}} Theological Repository in 1768, a journal {{committed}} to the open and rational inquiry of theological questions. Although he promised to print any contribution, only like-minded authors submitted articles. He was therefore obliged to provide much of the journal's content himself (this material {{became the basis for}} many of his later theological and metaphysical works). <b>After</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years, {{due to a lack of}} funds, he was forced to cease publishing the journal. He revived it in 1784 with similar results.|$|E

5|$|After Metternich's {{studies in}} Vienna, the Prince's death in September 1797 allowed Metternich to {{participate}} in the Congress of Rastatt. Initially his father took him as a secretary while ensuring that, when proceedings officially started in December 1797, he was named the representative of the Catholic Bench of the College of the Counts of Westphalia. A bored Metternich remained at Rastatt in this role until 1799 when the congress was finally wound down. During this period Eleonore had chosen to live with Metternich at Rastatt and gave birth to sons Francis (February 1798) and, shortly {{after the end of the}} Congress, Klemens (June 1799). Much to Metternich's anguish Klemens died <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days, and Francis soon contracted a lung infection from which he would never recover.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Pablo {{work with}} the first-team squad during {{pre-season}} training, coach César Ferrando {{was quoted as saying}} he would pick Pablo and ten others for the coming campaign. He was as good as his word: Pablo made his Segunda División debut in a 1–1 draw away to Terrassa on 31 August 2002, and went on to start 38 of Albacete's 42 matches as they finished the season in third place and were promoted to La Liga. <b>After</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> second-tier matches, he had made sufficient impact to attract interest from clubs both domestic and foreign and receive a call-up to the Spanish under-21 team for a friendly match against Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Irwin {{was born}} in 1858 in Toronto, Ontario, to an Irish {{blacksmith}} and a Canadian mother. As a child, he moved {{with his family to}} Boston and attended school there. He played local amateur baseball from 1873 until he was recruited by the Worcester Ruby Legs of the National Association in 1879. In late 1879, manager Frank Bancroft took Irwin and most of the other Worcester players on a baseball tour that included visits to New Orleans and Cuba. The team, which traveled under the name of the Hop Bitters, returned to the United States <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days due to financial and contractual difficulties. The team may have played as few as two games in Cuba.|$|E

5|$|He {{grew up in}} Nordhausen {{in central}} Germany and was {{orphaned}} at an early age. After embarking on a nautical career {{at the age of}} 16, he served briefly in the Imperial German Navy {{at the start of the}} 20th century. His ill health forced him to abandon a naval career, but he remained in the naval reserve. He joined the Hamburg America Line to work as a tour guide. While escorting a party of tourists, he met and married a German-American woman, but the marriage broke down <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months. His wife divorced him and he returned to Berlin.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} manager of Football Conference club Dover Athletic in December 2001. His managing stint at the Kent club {{was short and}} he was sacked in March 2002, <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months in charge, after the club's new owners decided to promote his assistant Clive Walker. He later made cameo appearances as a player at Canvey Island. He also began teaching young people from deprived backgrounds how to coach in a community scheme called Soccer Skills, and later worked in the special education sector. He set up his own educational consultancy that specialised in working with NEETs, in partnership with Brooklands College.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, while {{studying}} mathematics at Poznań University, Rejewski attended a secret cryptology course {{conducted by the}} Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau (Biuro Szyfrów), which he joined in September 1932. The Bureau had had no success in reading Enigma-enciphered messages and set Rejewski {{to work on the}} problem in late 1932; he deduced the machine's secret internal wiring <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks. Rejewski and his two colleagues then developed successive techniques for the regular decryption of Enigma messages. His contributions included the cryptologic card catalog, derived using the cyclometer that he had invented, and the cryptologic bomb.|$|E

5|$|In {{the seventh}} stage to Bordeaux, Trousselier {{punctured}} <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> kilometers. The {{rest of the}} cyclists quickly sped away from him, and Trousselier had to follow them alone for 200km. A few kilometers before Bordeaux, Trousselier {{caught up with the}} rest, and even managed to win the sprint. Louis Trousselier kept his lead {{until the end of the}} race, winning five stages. Trousselier was accused of bad sportsmanship: he reportedly smashed the inkstands of a control post to prevent his opponents from signing. Unlike the 1904 Tour de France, no stage winners, nor anyone from the top ten of the general classification, were disqualified.|$|E
5|$|England {{currently}} {{hold the}} trophy. They held the trophy for nine years, after beating the West Indies 3–1 to regain it in 2000; they successfully defended the trophy three times. West Indies regained the trophy in the 2009 {{series in the}} West Indies, winning 1–0. It was originally planned to consist of four Test matches. However an extra match was arranged when the second Test had to be abandoned <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> overs play because the ground was unfit. England regained the trophy in May 2009, winning a two Test series 2–0. The tour, coming uncommonly soon after England toured the West Indies, replaced the previously announced tour by Sri Lanka, which in turn was arranged to replace the originally scheduled tour by Zimbabwe.. Since then England have held onto the trophy {{up to and including}} the 2017 series in England, which they won to retain the Trophy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} stage, the riders fell <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> kilometres. Lipman broke a finger, {{and became the}} first rider to abandon this Tour. Around 100km in the race, Lucien Pothier lost ten minutes to the main group, led by Maurice Garin, because of a broken bicycle. In Cosne, at 174km, Pothier had reached the leading group. Aucouturier had lost more than one hour at that point. Just before the next control post in Nevers, Aucouturier fell on his face, and {{continued}} the race covered in blood. In {{the last part of the}} race, Maurice Garin and Lucien Pothier rode away from the others. They were attacked by four masked men in a car, but still finished as the first two, with Garin beating Pothier by 50m. The many flat tires and crashes of Aucouturier, seemingly the results of sabotage, gave him a time loss of several hours.|$|E
50|$|To his {{football}} credit, <b>after</b> <b>only</b> playing <b>a</b> <b>few</b> reserves matches, Watts debuted for the East Perth Football Club on a half back flank against Subiaco {{at the age}} of 17 in 1954 and would become a regular player with the club.|$|R

5|$|Reibey was funding {{all of the}} {{construction}} costs. When the structure was mostly complete a scandal erupted around him. He was alleged to have indecently dealt with a married woman. Her husband raised the issue with the bishop, then in 1870 with no action by the Church again with the Church of England Synod in England. Reibey subsequently took libel action but his complaint was dismissed and the Jury largely held that the allegations against him were true. Apart from these allegations, Reibey's wife's health had been declining, his property had been declining in value, and he wrote {{that he had been}} considering relinquishing the Archdeaconship for a while. <b>After</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years the lack of funds provided left only one person working on the site. All work ceased in 1870, by which time the walls were unfinished and the building still lacked a roof. Though the church was incomplete both Reibey and his wife Catherine were buried in a graveyard at the building's rear.|$|E
5|$|The 17th Airborne was to land its {{units in}} the {{southern}} portion of the area chosen for the operation, engaging the German forces that were defending the area, securing the Diersfordterwald Forest which dominated the surrounding area and capturing three bridges that spanned the River Issel. It would then hold the territory it had captured until it linked up units from the British 6th Airborne Division, which would land in the northern section of the operational area, and finally advance alongside 21st Army Group once the Allied ground forces had made contact with the airborne forces. To avoid heavy casualties such as those incurred by the British 1st Airborne Division during Operation Market Garden, both Allied airborne divisions would be dropped only after Allied ground units had secured crossings over the Rhine; the two divisions would also be dropped only a relatively short distance behind German lines, to ensure that reinforcements {{would be able to}} link up with them <b>after</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours and they would not be isolated.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} {{team for}} Unreal Tournament consisted of around 16 people. Most team members {{had worked on}} Unreal, though Epic hired {{a number of new}} developers to reinforce the team. Programmer Brandon Reinhart was one such hire, joining Epic in August 1998 to help with the support of Unreal and the development of Unreal Tournament. In December 1998, Reinhart discovered an Unreal mod called UBrowser, which provided a new user interface for finding multiplayer matches. After showing it to James Schmalz, the lead designer at Digital Extremes, Schmalz decided to hire the mod's author, Jack Porter. <b>After</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks Porter was already working with the team, replacing the game's existing menu system with his new interface. Epic founder Tim Sweeney worked on improving the networking code along with Steve Polge, who also wrote the original AI code and focused on player physics and general gameplay. Erik de Neve was responsible for the LOD character rendering, and various extra optimizations.|$|E
