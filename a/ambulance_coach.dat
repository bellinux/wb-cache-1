500|$|On game night, coach Taylor gives a {{pep talk}} where he warns the players against taking the opponents – Westerby High School – too lightly. They say their {{rallying}} cry, [...] "Clear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can't Lose!" [...] and enter the field. The first half is problematic for the Panthers, {{and at the end}} of the second half, the visitors make a potentially game-winning interception. Street is the only one left to make a tackle. He succeeds, but the tackle is so hard that he remains prone on the ground. The crowd is left in silence as the starting quarterback does not move, and has to be taken off on a stretcher to a waiting <b>ambulance.</b> <b>Coach</b> Taylor now has to put in the highly unprepared Saracen, who initially makes several silly mistakes. The coach tells him to relax and focus, and Saracen manages to connect with Smash, who scores a touchdown. Riggins recovers the ensuing onside kick for the Panthers. In the final seconds of the game, Saracen throws a long pass to a receiver, who makes it to the end zone for another touchdown. As the Panthers win the game, both teams gather at mid-field to pray for Jason Street. Team members then head over to the hospital, where Street's condition is still unclear. Riggins and Smash reconcile, while Julie tries to comfort Lyla. In a voice-over, coach Taylor is heard saying that [...] "We are all vulnerable, and we will all at some point in our lives fall." ...|$|E

She had lost two stone lb, or 12.6 kg, was all huge eyes and matted hair, untouched since the bullet went through her skull. The bullet was still in her head, inoperable the doctor said. She could not walk, talked with difficulty and was a changed personality, like one who had had a stroke. Not only was her appearance shocking, she was a stranger, someone we did not know. We brought her back to England in an <b>ambulance</b> <b>coach</b> attached to a train. Every jolt was agony to her." ...|$|E
