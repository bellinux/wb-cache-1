In this thesis, the metal deposition process is {{performed by a}} robot with a wire feeder tool and a laser as energy source to melt the metal wire. The robot programming for robotized metal deposition process can be completely automated by computer aided robotics software. University West is currently developing an add-in application in a computer aided robotics software, Process Simulate, {{that is capable of}} programming the robotized metal deposition process. The first goal of this thesis was to verify the up to now developed software and the process from CAD drawing down to robot code. Another goal was to find and implement an algorithm that will reduce the number of locations on a circular arc to three locations. The algorithm to minimize the locations must be capable of changing all the different curvature paths to linear and circular arc motions which are easy to translate to robot code. The user should be able to decide the fitting precision of the approximated motion path to the original path. A real robot cell setup is modelled in Process Simulate. This lets Process Simulate generate the correct robot code for that specific cell.   Since each robot cell has its own unique setup, a custom script will be developed that changes the universal robot code, that Process Simulate generates, to the custom robot code required in this specific robot cell. The software is improved and tested from CAD drawing down to robot code but still needs to be debugged more and needs implementation of some non-existing features...|$|R

40|$|An {{innovative}} and low cost <b>additive</b> <b>layer</b> <b>manufacturing</b> (ALM) process {{is used to}} produce γ-TiAl based alloy wall components. Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) provides the heat source for this new approach, combined with in-situ alloying through separate feeding of commercially pure Ti and Al wires into the weld pool. This paper investigates the morphology, microstructure and mechanical properties of the additively manufactured TiAl material, and how these {{are affected by the}} location within the manufactured component. The typical additively layer manufactured morphology exhibits epitaxial growth of columnar grains and several layer bands. The fabricated γ-TiAl based alloy consists of comparatively large α 2 grains in the near-substrate region, fully lamellar colonies with various sizes and interdendritic γ structure in the intermediate layer bands, followed by fine dendrites and interdendritic γ phases in the top region. Microhardness measurements and tensile testing results indicated relatively homogeneous mechanical characteristics throughout the deposited material. The exception to this homogeneity occurs in the near-substrate region immediately adjacent to the pure Ti substrate used in these experiments, where the alloying process is not as well controlled as in the higher regions. The tensile properties are also different for the vertical (build) direction and horizontal (travel) direction because of the differing microstructure in each direction. The microstructure variation and strengthening mechanisms resulting from the new manufacturing approach are analysed in detail.
