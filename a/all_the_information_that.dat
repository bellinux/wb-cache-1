25|$|Pliny {{says that}} Timaeus (born about 350 BC) {{believed}} Pytheas' {{story of the}} discovery of amber. Strabo says that Dicaearchus (died about 285BC) did not trust the stories of Pytheas. That is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>that</b> survives concerning the date of Pytheas' voyage. Presuming that Timaeus would not have written until after he was 20 years old in about 330BC and Dicaearchus would have needed time to write his most mature work, after 300BC, there is no reason not to accept Henry Fanshawe Tozer's window of 330–300BC for the voyage. Some would give Timaeus an extra 5years, bringing the voyage down to 325BC at earliest. There is no further evidence.|$|E

25|$|The {{night before}} he was {{scheduled}} to leave Shanghai in June 1931, Xiang Zhongfa, who was one of Zhou's most senior agents, decided {{to spend the night in}} a hotel with his mistress, ignoring Zhou's warnings about the danger. In the morning, a KMT informant who had been trailing Xiang spotted him as he was leaving the hotel. Xiang was immediately arrested and imprisoned within the French Concession. Zhou attempted to prevent Xiang's expected extradition to KMT-controlled China by having his agents bribe the chief of police in the French Concession, but the KMT authorities appealed directly to the authorities of the French Concession, ensuring that the chief of police could not intervene. Zhou's hopes that Xiang would be transferred to Nanjing, giving him an opportunity to kidnap Xiang, also came to naught. The French agreed to transfer Xiang to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, under the command of General Xiong Shihui, who subjected Xiang to relentless torture and interrogation. Once he became convinced that Xiang had given his torturers <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>that</b> they requested, Chiang Kai-shek ordered Xiang to be executed.|$|E

2500|$|Similar {{factors have}} led to criticisms of Jaspers' {{definition}} of true delusions as being ultimately 'un-understandable'. Critics (such as R. D. Laing) have argued that {{this leads to the}} diagnosis of delusions being based on the subjective understanding of a particular psychiatrist, who may not have access to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>that</b> might make a belief otherwise interpretable. R. D. Laing's hypothesis has been applied to some forms of projective therapy to [...] "fix" [...] a delusional system so that it cannot be altered by the patient. Psychiatric researchers at Yale University, Ohio State University and the Community Mental Health Center of Middle Georgia have used novels and motion picture films as the focus. Texts, plots and cinematography are discussed and the delusions approached tangentially. This use of fiction to decrease the malleability of a delusion was employed in a joint project by science-fiction author Philip Jose Farmer and Yale psychiatrist A. James Giannini. They wrote the novel Red Orc's Rage, which, recursively, deals with delusional adolescents who are treated with a form of projective therapy. In this novel's fictional setting other novels written by Farmer are discussed and the characters are symbolically integrated into the delusions of fictional patients. This particular novel was then applied to real-life clinical settings.|$|E
