[...] This kernel estimator works for univariate <b>and</b> <b>multivariate</b> samples alike.

40|$|Four {{families}} of special functions, depending on n variables, are studied. We call them symmetric <b>and</b> antisymmetric <b>multivariate</b> sine <b>and</b> cosine functions. They are given as determinants or antideterminants of matrices, whose matrix elements are sine or cosine functions of one variable each. These functions are eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator, satisfying specific {{conditions at the}} boundary of a certain domain F of the n-dimensional Euclidean space. Discrete and continuous orthogonality on F of the functions within each family, allows one to introduce symmetrized <b>and</b> antisymmetrized <b>multivariate</b> Fourier-like transforms, involving the symmetric <b>and</b> antisymmetric <b>multivariate</b> sine <b>and</b> cosine functions.

The {{results of}} this are low pregnancy weight gain and IUGR, followed by LBW, with its associated greater risks of infection and higher perinatal mortality rates. For these reasons, {{in the setting of}} no large previous studies in Venezuela about this problem, a national multicentric study was conducted. Methods. Pregnant women from nine states were studied, a prenatal evaluation with a coproparasitological study. Univariated <b>and</b> <b>multivariated</b> analyses were made to determine risk factors for intestinal parasitosis and related anemia. Results...|$|R
40|$|Because {{the power}} {{properties}} of traditional repeated measures <b>and</b> hierarchical <b>multivariate</b> linear models {{have not been}} clearly determined in the balanced design for longitudinal studies in the literature, the authors present a power comparison study of traditional repeated measures <b>and</b> hierarchical <b>multivariate</b> linear models under 3 variance-covariance structures. The results from a full-crossed simulation design suggest that traditional repeated measures have significantly higher power than do hierarchical multivariate linear models for main effects, but they have significantly lower power for interaction effects in most situations. Significant power differences are also exhibited when power is compared across different covariance structures. Keywords covariance structure; hierarchical multivariate linear models; longitudinal study; power analysis; traditional repeated measures In longitudinal studies, both traditional repeated measures (TRM) <b>and</b> hierarchical <b>multivariate</b> linear models (HMLM) can be applied for a balanced design when the focus is testing fixed main effects.
