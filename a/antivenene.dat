50|$|Coincidentally, the Healesville Sanctuary some 90 km from Melbourne was {{in need of}} a {{director}} and he was appointed. The animals there included quolls, Tasmanian devils, dingoes and various birds of prey, to which he added tiger snakes that were milked for <b>antivenene,</b> and platypus. Many animals were housed in large paddock-like areas with swing-weighted gates so that visitors could freely interact with the animals. He also conducted daily 'feeding' displays of the platypuses.|$|E
50|$|Founded in 1916 the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, an Australian {{government}} body focused on vaccine manufacture. Under the first director, William Penfold, CSL commenced {{operation in the}} vacant Walter and Eliza Hall Institute building at the Melbourne Hospital in 1918, before moving to its purpose-built Parkville premises in the following year. After ongoing disputes with the Commonwealth Department of Health and its director, (John) Howard Cumpston, Penfold resigned in 1927 {{and was replaced by}} Frederic Morgan. Soon after Morgan's appointment, CSL was drawn into a serious public health disaster when a batch of its diphtheria toxin-antitoxin was implicated in the deaths of twelve children in {{what became known as the}} 'Bundaberg tragedy' of 1928. Although CSL's manufacturing processes were absolved, its labelling procedures were seen to be in error, leading to an enduring focus on the highest standards across the facility's production. In 1928, CSL also became involved in <b>antivenene</b> (antivenom) manufacture in conjunction with the snake venom research undertaken by Charles Kellaway at the Hall Institute. This led to the successful clinical testing of <b>antivenene</b> against tiger snake Notechis scutatus bite in 1930, and its commercial release in 1931. In 1934, the research on snake venoms was transferred from the Hall Institute to CSL under the direction of former snake showman, Tom 'Pambo' Eades. This represented the initiation of research at the laboratories - an outcome its directors had been seeking for over a decade. The relationship with the Hall Institute continued until World War II, particularly via joint projects on viral diseases including polio and influenza coordinated by Frank Macfarlane Burnet and Esmond 'Bill' Keogh. Keogh played an important role in the establishment of penicillin production at CSL in 1944 - a critical wartime achievement.|$|E
5000|$|By chance, the {{wildlife}} sanctuary at Healesville, about 90 kilometres north-east of Melbourne, needed to replace Robert Eadie, {{who had been}} the honorary Curator since the early 1930s. In 1937, Fleay was appointed at £7 per week, the first paid Director of the sanctuary, to develop Healesville's wildlife sanctuary on temperate rainforest on Badger Creek. Fleay introduced 95 large tiger snakes to the sanctuary which were displayed on an island and milked for <b>antivenene</b> purposes. At Healesville, Fleay recommenced his breeding and conservation programs in earnest, achieving worldwide recognition. His greatest achievement at Healesville was breeding the first platypus is captivity in 1943. He designed and built a new platypussary, and, in November 1943, [...] "Corrie" [...] the platypus was born. Despite numerous attempts by other scientist and sanctuaries, Fleay remains the only person to have successfully bred and reared a platypus in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Fairley {{returned}} to Australia in 1927 and rejoined the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He worked {{there for two}} years, collaborating with the new director, Charles Kellaway in studies of snake venoms and with Harold Dew {{on the development of}} diagnostic tests for echinococcosis. Fairley dedicated most of 1928 to the snake venom programme, co-ordinating an enormous body of epidemiological data – including a questionnaire to Australian clinicians – on the frequency and outcome of bites by Australian elapid snakes. This work involved numerous milkings to establish typical and maximal venom yields, innovative studies of snake dentition using wax moulds, and detailed dissections to describe each species' biting apparatus. Fairley furthermore undertook in vivo studies of envenomation in a range of large animal species, to determine the efficacy of prevailing first-aid measures. He concluded that at best, ligature and local venesection might slow time to death after a significant envenomation. This reinforced the need for effective <b>antivenenes</b> (antivenoms) for the more dangerous local species of snakes, notably the tiger snake (Notechis scutatus), death adder (Acanthophis antarcticus) and copperhead (Austrelaps superbus), although only the former was suitable for manufacture by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (now CSL Limited).|$|R
50|$|Although {{his early}} studies {{garnered}} {{a degree of}} acclaim, it was in late 1927 that Kellaway found his experimental forte. At the suggestion of Neil Hamilton Fairley - then resident at the Hall Institute whilst recuperating from tropical sprue - a significant research programme was instigated into Australian snake venoms. This practical and scientific problem had not been substantively addressed {{since the turn of}} the century researches by Frank Tidswell and Charles Martin. Kellaway also used the opportunity to negotiate with the Minister for Health one of the first ad-hoc grants for medical research in Australia, preceded only by a limited number of cancer investigations. This grant lasted from 1928-31 and was a milestone in Commonwealth support for independent research in medical science. Working with Fairley, Holden and Fannie Eleanor Williams from the Institute, plus Frederick Morgan from the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (now CSL Limited) and Tom 'Pambo' Eades from the Melbourne Zoo, Kellway's research encompassed venoms from a plethora of Australian snake species (elapidae). This work initially focused on characteristing biting apparatus, venom yields, pharmacological activity, lethality and immunology. Clinical work included investigations into the appropriate first-aid treatment of snakebite and the development of <b>antivenenes</b> (antivenoms) against tiger snake (Notechis scutatus), copperhead (Austrelaps superbus) and death adder (Acanthophis antarcticus) venoms, although only the first was found suitable for manufacture by CSL. In addition to expanding field work on identification and characterisation of a wide range of Australian elapids and their venoms, Kellaway's work through the 1930s broadened to include platypus, mussel, Sydney funnel-web spider (Atrax robustus) and redback spider (Latrodectus hasselti) venoms. This huge corpus of work, totalling over 70 publications by the end of the programme, resulted in an invitation for Kellaway to review his oeuvre via the prestigious Charles E Dohme Memorial Lectureships at Johns Hopkins University Medical School (now Johns Hopkins School of Medicine) in 1936 - an impressive international accolade.|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} features of bites by the Australian scrub tick, Ixodes holocyclus, are reviewed. Eight cases of tick bite are summarized, including six {{new cases of}} tick paralysis in children. In almost all cases neuroparalysis became worse transiently, after the tick had been removed. One child with life-threatening respiratory and bulbar palsy received canine antitick <b>antivenene,</b> with rapid reversal of clinical signs. The differential diagnosis of tick bite includes all acute childhood diseases which can affect the motor units; the importance of including the possibility of tick envenomation in the differential diagnosis of acute weakness or paralysis in children is illustrated. The {{clinical features}} of neuromuscular paralysis are described, together with {{a review of the}} tick 2 ̆ 7 s local effects at the bite site...|$|E
40|$|In 1963 incoagulable {{blood was}} {{observed}} in victims bitten by the Malayan pit viper (Agkistrodon rhodostomd) [1], and ancrod, the factor responsible, was subsequently isolated. Ancrod is a highly specific protease which has a thrombin-like effect on fibrinogen, but results {{in the formation of}} an unstable fibrin clot which is readily dispersed and rapidly lysed. Ancrod administration thus leads to rapid depletion of plasma fibrinogen. Controlled defibrinogenation can be maintained for several weeks by daily infusions of ancrod, with dose adjustments according to response. If overdose occurs the effect car) be reversed rapidly by infusion of fibrinogen and <b>antivenene.</b> Extensive experience in deep vein thrombosis and other thrombotic disease suggests that the risk of haemorrhagic complications may be less than with heparin, and that other side-effects are very rare [2]. What has this to do with glomerulonephritis? In a variety of severe acute renal diseases, including proliferative glomerulonephritides, lupus nephritis, and the thrombotic micro-angiopathies, fibrin can be shown to be present in capillary loop thrombi, or in Bowman's space where it is believed to stimulate crescent formation. The associated clinical picture is often one of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, where progressive irreversible glomeru...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} version {{is available at}} [URL] in vitro and in vivo hematological effects of puff adder (Bitis arietans) venom in the baboon (Papio ursinus) with regard to its effect on coagulation, fibrinolysis and platelet aggregation were studied. There is a delay in the intrinsic coagulation mechanism with fibrinolysis and in vitro fibrinogenolysis. Normal human platelets demonstrated an extreme susceptibility to puff adder venom in vitro. The aggregation of platelets with small dosages of venom was irreversible. The effect {{is related to the}} dosage, and appears {{to be the result of}} multiple enzyme activities, some of which are heat labile. In minimal amounts there is evidence of consumption of blood coagulation factors with sustained thrombocytopenia, but no fibrinolysis, where heparin therapy might have a beneficial effect. With larger dosages of venom the thrombocytopenia, hemorrhagic effects and shock are not prevented or corrected by heparin and heparinisation might even be harmful. The effect of heparin should be further investigated, since it might have a place in mildly affected cases of snakebite, where absorption into the blood has been slow or intermittent. It might be indicated when <b>antivenene</b> is not available or when patients are sensitive to serum. Publishers'Versio...|$|E
