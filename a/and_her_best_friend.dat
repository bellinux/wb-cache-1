500|$|Film critic James Berardinelli {{identified}} Nala as The Lion Kings [...] "sole significant female character." [...] Screenwriter Linda Woolverton conceived Nala [...] "as part of {{a gradual}} progression ... which have driven recent public conversation about what young girls {{should be able to}} expect from their cinematic role models." [...] In early versions of the screenplay, Nala has a younger brother named Mheetu, who enjoys accompanying his sister <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> Simba on their adventures. Pronounced [...] "me too", the character's name alludes to this personality trait. At one point, Simba was supposed to save the cub from a wildebeest stampede, and Nala would eventually become responsible for protecting Mheetu from Simba's tyrannical uncle Scar. Nala also had a fox friend named Bhati. According to Woolverton, Mheetu and Bhati were eventually written out of the film because their stories were beginning to distract from Simba's, in addition to the Mheetu-Scar subplot making the film too dark when combined with the death of Simba's father Mufasa. At one point, Nala also had a father; the character was similarly abandoned.|$|E
