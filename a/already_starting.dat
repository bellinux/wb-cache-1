5|$|The primary {{point of}} the Dictum was the {{re-establishment}} of royal authority. The Provisions of Oxford, that had been forced on the king, were repudiated, and it was {{made clear that the}} appointment of ministers was entirely a royal prerogative. King Henry in turn reconfirmed Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest. Measures were taken to renounce the increasing veneration of the fallen Simon de Montfort, whom some were <b>already</b> <b>starting</b> to consider a martyr and a possible saint.|$|E
5|$|Connor {{appears in}} the Family Reunion arc of Angel & Faith. Willow, on a quest to restore magic to herself and the world asks Angel and Faith to travel from London to LA with her so she can use the {{residual}} magic in Buffy's scythe and Connor's connection to Quor'toth to reopen the tear in reality at the Hyperion Hotel {{to get to a}} dimension that has magic. Angel & Faith agree to this in order to gain the piece of Giles's soul in the scythe, but will only help reopen the tear and go to Quor'toth if Connor agrees to it. Connor is living a normal life as a college student studying social work with a girlfriend. Though initially disappointed Angel ignored his attempts to contact his father, Connor is glad to have Angel in his life and realizes that his normal life is precious, but he still wants Angel {{to be a part of}} it. Angel is genuinely proud of the man his son has become. Connor agrees that magic needs to be returned to the world as the most vulnerable in society are <b>already</b> <b>starting</b> to lose hope without it.|$|E

25|$|Britain {{was still}} reconstructing itself after {{the devastation of}} World War II, and, {{although}} the economy was recovering, towns and cities still had large areas of bomb damage that needed rebuilding or re-use. New motorways were being planned and built across the country, and the motor car was <b>already</b> <b>starting</b> to fill up towns and villages. Wartime had seen the establishment of central planning, and the discipline of urban planning was looking for good patterns and policies to be implemented as they rebuilt.|$|E

25|$|The 19th century {{ideas of}} natural {{selection}} by Darwin and Mendelian genetics were put together with population genetics, early in the twentieth century. The modern synthesis also addressed {{the relationship between the}} broad-scale changes of macroevolution seen by palaeontologists and the small-scale microevolution of local populations of living organisms. The synthesis was defined differently by its founders, with Ernst Mayr in 1959, G. Ledyard Stebbins in 1966 and Theodosius Dobzhansky in 1974 offering differing numbers of basic postulates in their definitions, though they all included natural selection, working on heritable variation supplied by mutation. Other major figures in the synthesis included E. B. Ford, Bernhard Rensch, Ivan Schmalhausen, and George Gaylord Simpson. An early event in the modern synthesis was R. A. Fisher's 1918 paper on mathematical population genetics, but William Bateson, and separately Udny Yule, were <b>already</b> <b>starting</b> to show how Mendelian genetics could work in evolution in 1902.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch also {{promoted}} the plantings of many white wine varieties {{that were in}} fashion through Europe. In regions like Muscadet, in the Loire Valley, the Dutch encouraged the planting of Melon de Bourgogne which produced more reliable harvest than the region's red wine varieties. The practice of blending different grape varieties from different areas was also influenced by the Dutch {{as a means of}} improving weaker wines or to adapt wines to changing public tastes. When the English developed tastes for stronger sweeter wines, the Dutch were the first to bulk up the Gascon claret wines with the wines of Cahors. Skilled engineers, the Dutch drained the marshy Medoc (left bank) region in the 17th century and began planting the region with vineyards. Prior to this time, Bordeaux's most sought-after wines came from the well-drained soil of the Graves region including the estate of Chateau Haut-Brion. By the end of the 17th century, with the aid of the Dutch, the future First Growth estates of Chateau Lafite, Latour and Margaux were planted and <b>already</b> <b>starting</b> to get notice abroad.|$|E
25|$|The Western Chalukya Empire under Satyashraya and Someshvara I {{tried to}} wriggle out of Chola {{domination}} {{from time to}} time, primarily due to the Chola influence in the Vengi kingdom. The Western Chalukyas mounted several unsuccessful attempts to engage the Chola emperors in war, and except for a brief occupation of Vengi territories between 1118–1126, all their other attempts ended in failure with successive Chola emperors routing the armies of the Chalukyas at various places in many wars. Virarajendra Chola defeated Someshvara II of the Western Chalukya Empire and made an alliance with Prince VikramadityaVI. Cholas always successfully controlled the Chalukyas in the western Deccan by defeating them in war and levying tribute on them. Even under the emperors of the Cholas like KulothungaI and Vikrama Chola, the wars against the Chalukyas were mainly fought in Chalukya territories in Karnataka or in the Telugu country like Vengi, Kakinada, Anantapur, or Gutti. Then the former feudatories like the Hoysalas, Yadvas, and Kakatiyas steadily increased their power and finally replaced the Chalukyas. With the occupation of Dharwar in North Central Karnataka by the Hoysalas under Vishnuvardhana, where he based himself with his son NarasimhaI in-charge at the Hoysala capital Dwarasamudra around 1149, and with the Kalachuris occupying the Chalukyan capital for over 35 years from around 1150–1151, the Chalukya kingdom was <b>already</b> <b>starting</b> to dissolve.|$|E

500|$|The Ba'ath {{movement}} was not running {{as smoothly as}} the rest of the world believed; the Iraqi Regional Branch was <b>already</b> <b>starting</b> to lose membership. The Iraqi military and the party's militant arm, the National Guard, detested each other. Al-Sadi, the Regional Secretary of the Iraqi Regional Branch, was eventually exiled to Madrid, Spain on 11 November by several military officers and moderate Ba'athists. An anxious Aflaq hastily traveled from Syria and dissolved the Regional Command of the Iraqi Regional Branch, exclaiming that the National Command would rule Iraq in its place until a new Regional Command was elected. This was not greeted warmly by the majority of Iraqi military officers and Ba'athists – the idea that a Christian was to rule over a Muslim country was considered [...] "insensitive".|$|E
500|$|The Huffington Post editor Laura Prudom and TV Fanatic's C. Orlando also {{highlighted}} Carlyle's {{acting and}} storyline. Prudom liked Dourif's casting, but singled out praise for Mary Margaret and David's poster scene, calling it [...] "beautifully written and played, understated {{and filled with}} longing." [...] The A.V. Clubs Oliver Sava was more critical of the episode, and graded [...] "Desperate Souls" [...] with a C. He remarked that Once Upon a Time [...] "lacks Losts sophistication and insight, instead laying out plot in the plainest terms possible, no matter how tedious that may be... It hasn’t even been ten episodes, and the formula is <b>already</b> <b>starting</b> to feel stale." [...] Despite this, Sava saw potential for the series, noting that [...] "the writers just need to take fuller advantage of the wealth of mythology that the fairy tale stories give them." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} season, the writers had the idea one of the {{background}} survivors would emerge and receive an on-island flashback episode to help answer the question, [...] "What the hell is going on with the other 35 people who nothing ever happens to?" [...] The first of those was Leslie Arzt, only for him to explode a few episodes later. It was originally conceived only a woman, who was previously an actress, would be introduced into the main storyline, but the idea later changed to include her boyfriend as well. Nikki and Paulo were also originally set [...] "to have anchored a winking arc of stories". However the writers instead decided to tell their story in one episode and quickly remove the characters, due to complaints about the characters and the third season's decline in viewership. It also became a running gag that Sawyer did not know who Nikki and Paulo were, calling them [...] "Nina" [...] and [...] "Pablo" [...] and asking [...] "who the hell [...] ". Lindelof later stated, [...] "We had the feeling with Nikki and Paulo that it wasn't right about a month before the fans started reacting.

500|$|Wordplay is a {{key element}} in Wodehouse's writing. This can take the form of puns, such as in Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, when Bertie is {{released}} after a night in the police cells, and says that he has [...] "a pinched look" [...] about him. Linguistic confusion is another humorous mechanism, such as in Uncle Dynamite when Constable Potter says he has been [...] "assaulted by the duck pond." [...] In reply, Sir Aylmer, confusing the two meanings of the word [...] "by", asks: [...] "How the devil can you be assaulted by a duck pond?" [...] Wodehouse also uses metaphor and mixed metaphor to add humour. Some come through exaggeration, such as Bingo Little's infant child who [...] "not only has the aspect of a mass murderer, but that of a mass murderer suffering from an ingrown toenail", or Wooster's complaint that [...] "the rumpuses that Bobbie Wickham is <b>already</b> <b>starting</b> may be amusing to her, but not to the unfortunate toads beneath the harrow whom she ruthlessly plunges into the soup." [...] Bertie Wooster's half-forgotten vocabulary also provides a further humorous device. In Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit Bertie asks Jeeves [...] "Let a plugugly like young Thos loose in the community with a cosh, and you are inviting disaster and... what's the word? Something about cats." [...] Jeeves replies, [...] "Cataclysms, sir?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{general strike}} {{over the winter}} of 1960–61 (...) , known as the Strike of the Century (Grève du Siècle), was a major series of strikes in Belgium which began on 14 December 1960 and lasted {{approximately}} six weeks. The strike was instigated by the militant trade union, the General Federation of Belgian Labour (FGTB-ABVV), against {{an attempt by the}} government of Gaston Eyskens to improve the state of Belgium's public finances by introducing a series of austerity measures known as the Loi Unique or Eenheidswet.
