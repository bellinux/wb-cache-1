50|$|Many of Boon's {{works are}} {{composed}} {{so as to}} give players room to discover their own way through the piece. His clarinet piece 3x, for example, consists of three staves of music containing pitches in three respective registers among which the clarinetist is free to move. In <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>note,</b> Michael Pisaro describes Boon's piano piece 14x as follows:Although the piece is quite slow, and is seemingly a simple series of sustained chords with an occasional beautiful melodic gesture, the technique employed is actually very challenging. No pedal is used, therefore, in order maintain the mostly 10-note sounds all fingers of both hands are employed, holding down keys for the whole piece. What at first seems nearly impossible reveals itself to be ingeniously composed to be just possible.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{audience}} at Malmö was Ola Hansson, who had just published a short story from which, Strindberg claimed in <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>note,</b> the title and theme of Pariah were taken. However, Hanssen said he didn’t recognize anything of his original theme. Hanssen also reports {{that at this time}} he had lent Strindberg a book of mysteries by Edgar Allan Poe, and that Poe was a significant influence on Strindberg’s writing at this time. A possible example of that influence, is that a scene of psychological detective work occurs in Poe’s short story, [...] "The Gold Bug", that appears to have inspired an episode in Pariah. Strindberg's original title for the play is “Paria”, with its Hindu etymology. Some English translations use the title, “The Outcast”, which, however, can be confused with an earlier play by Strindberg, “The Outlaw”.|$|E
5000|$|Jay Nordlinger of The New Criterion was {{slightly}} {{more critical of}} the piece, however, remarking, [...] "I found Karawane a bit tiresome. But perhaps the problem was my lack of patience, rather than a lack of imagination on the composer's part. In <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>note</b> of his own, Gilbert called Salonen's work 'deliciously whimsical while also being fully formed and rigorous.' I'll buy that. And I'll definitely buy Salonen, who is a credit to this musical age." [...] Despite calling it [...] "entertaining and grandiose," [...] George Grella of the New York Classical Review similarly observed that the [...] "narrative feel of Karawane loses out to density over a 30-minute duration." [...] He added, [...] "There are entertaining, colorful bits of music that seem inspired by other composers, like Ennio Morricone, Philip Glass, and John Adams. In particular, sections seem like responses to Harmonium. Salonen embraces clichés with a knowing wink, but they add bigness to a piece that is already overblown." ...|$|E
5000|$|Apart {{from his}} ongoing (and {{probably}} unfinished) {{work on the}} Messe des pauvres, the Prélude was the only music Satie composed in 1894. [...] In the wake of Satie's 1911 [...] "discovery" [...] by the Société Musicale Indépendante (instigated by Maurice Ravel), and the sudden interest in his music, his new young protégé Alexis Roland-Manuel offered to orchestrate the Prélude de la porte héroïque du ciel. His version was premiered at an SMI concert at the Salle Gaveau in Paris on June 17, 1912. Satie did not attend, but he provided <b>an</b> ironic <b>program</b> <b>note</b> in which he described the piece as [...] "a little prelude worked in ivory like a tapestry of sound, a little prelude full of mystical sweetness, a little prelude full of ecstatic joy, a little prelude full of intimate goodness." [...] Rouart, Lerolle & Cie published the original piano score (with Satie's self-dedication) later that year.|$|R

5000|$|In Henry Bellamann's {{program note}} to the 1927 premiere {{of the first and}} second {{movements}} of the symphony (<b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>note</b> that seems to be ghost-written by Ives, as his tone of voice and use of language is obvious throughout), the program of the symphony is described this way: [...] "The aesthetic program of the work is that of many of the greatest literary and musical masterpieces of the world—the searching questions of What? and Why? which the spirit of man asks of life. This is particularly the sense of the prelude. The... succeeding movements are the diverse answers in which existence replies." [...] In his Memos, Ives misquotes Bellamann's program note by attributing to it the famous description of the Finale (hence providing further proof that he had supplied descriptive text to Bellamann for the note, with Bellamann dropping the Finale's description because of its absence on the 1927 performance): [...] "The last movement is an apotheosis of the preceding content, in terms that {{have something to do with}} the reality of existence and its religious experience." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{composition}} {{was written}} in first months of 1925, but Janáček decided on its inception {{in the end of}} 1924. He was impressed by the skills of pianist Jan Heřman, and therefore he dedicated the composition to him. (The first printing by Hudební matice from 1926 bears the dedication: [...] "To Jan Heřman"). The concertino was at first intended to be a piano concerto, but later grew into a small chamber concerto. It was first entitled [...] "Spring". This title Janáček wrote into the finished manuscript; he also added a date (25 April 1925) and <b>a</b> <b>program</b> <b>note.</b> The première of this 'small concerto' took place on 16 February 1926 in Brno at the third concert of the Moravian Composer's Club. The piano part was performed by Ilona Štěpánová-Kurzová, František Kudláček played first violin, Viktor Nopp the second, the viola was played by Josef Trkan, the clarinet by Stanislav Krtička, František Janský played French horn and František Bříza the bassoon.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the genre of libretto, the sung words for music theatre. The “little book” which accompanies every operatic {{performance}} is not just <b>an</b> extended <b>program</b> <b>note</b> to the spectacle, but in fact a substantial literary form in its own right. However, despite the immense influence of Wagner, the output from librettists in an operatic collaboration, has been serious ignored; indeed in opera the aesthetic function of language is frequently diminished and foreshortened, because it is often re-directed by and within the music. The result is that librettists are often seen as offering words to be “decomposed” by composers {{in the process of}} operatic collaboration. 	Opera, in the English language, finally achieved its rightful status, alongside its European counterparts, {{during the second half of}} the twentieth century. The thesis is intended to encompass something of the vast diversity of this genre and discusses a number of individual works as constituting legitimate literary artefacts in their own right. There will be five chapters featured in the thesis and each chapter is devoting to a specific theme...|$|R
