2500|$|Uncritical use of {{standardized}} test scores to evaluate teacher and school performance is inappropriate, because the students' scores are influenced by three things: what students learn in school, what students learn outside of school, and the students' innate intelligence. The school only has control over one of these three factors. Value-added modeling has been proposed {{to cope with this}} criticism by statistically controlling for innate ability and out-of-school contextual factors. In a value-added system of interpreting test scores, analysts estimate an expected score for each student, based on factors such as the student's own previous test scores, primary language, or socioeconomic status.

30|$|Apart from {{comparing}} participants’ {{scores to}} the expected {{values for the}} sample, another more focused approach to determine whether size of graphs subconsciously influenced participants was to compare their individual scores to their expected values (i.e., values calculated {{based on their own}} trustworthiness formulae). This was therefore moving away from assessing outliers as it pertains to the expected score across the sample, to identifying and evaluating outliers relating to the respective participant's expected graph score. For this investigation, therefore, we used the formula generated for each participant based on the linear regression analysis, and compared the new expected values to the <b>actual</b> <b>scores</b> that were given to the respective graphs. To gather an idea of whether graph size or area might have influenced participants, we checked for cases where <b>actual</b> <b>scores</b> were 50 % or more different to the expected scores, and size of the graph (or more accurately, the calculated area of the filled graph) was at least 25 % different to the expected value. To calculate the filled area, we used the equation presented below in (3). This splits the pentagon into five triangles, calculates the blue-shaded area in each, sums these, then divides by the total pentagon area to determine the size percentage filled.|$|R
