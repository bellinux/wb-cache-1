5|$|Henry was an intellectual. The first English king with {{a modern}} humanist education, he read and wrote English, French and Latin, and was {{thoroughly}} {{at home in}} his well-stocked library. He personally annotated many books and wrote and published one of his own. To promote the {{public support for the}} reformation of the church, Henry had numerous pamphlets and lectures prepared. For example, Richard Sampson's Oratio (1534) was an argument for absolute obedience to the monarchy and claimed that the English church had always been independent from Rome. At the popular level, theatre and minstrel troupes funded by the crown travelled around the land to promote the new religious practices: the pope and Catholic priests and monks were mocked as foreign devils, while the glorious king was hailed as a brave <b>and</b> <b>heroic</b> defender of the true faith. Henry worked hard to present an image of unchallengeable authority and irresistible power.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the crucial}} points {{is that there are}} several {{different}} sources for the Battle itself, including poems and songs in Old English, Old Norse, Old Welsh, Middle English, Latin, and Anglo-Norman, highlighting a wide potential of sources in order to glean information about the battle from all sides of the campaign. Furthermore, while these sources might be seen as biased due to national origin and underlying romantic <b>and</b> <b>heroic</b> narrative constructions of the battle for each side, some of the sources, such as the Chronicle work as points of reference to the more lyrical constructions presented in other popular narrative formats. Although there is a relative lack of iron-clad primary sources that are completely unbiased, by taking into account all of these sources, historians and literary scholars can gain a fuller image of the military maneuvers and actions taken by the respective leaders of armies involved in this battle.|$|E
