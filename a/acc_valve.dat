50|$|One common active {{clearance}} control {{consists of}} the <b>ACC</b> <b>valve</b> which mixes hot and cold air from the compressor exit and the bypass duct, respectively, to a desired temperature. The air is routed to flow through tubes surrounding the casing at each turbine stage. This air expands or contracts the turbine case and in doing so, it maintains the accurate clearance between the turbine case and the blade tip. This clearance should be maintained accurately which {{is essential for the}} engine efficiency and its performance. The <b>ACC</b> <b>valve</b> opening is adjusted automatically by the FADEC system depending on the thrust lever position.|$|E

We present {{an extension of}} recently developed Loop and Schaefer’s approximation of Catmull-Clark surfaces (ACC) for surfaces with creases and corners which are essential for most applications. We discuss the integration of <b>ACC</b> into <b>Valve’s</b> Source game engine and analyze performance of our implementation...|$|R

The registry will serve as an objective, comprehensive, and scientifically based resource {{to improve the quality}} of patient care, to monitor the safety and effectiveness of TVT devices, to serve as an analytic resource for TVT research, and to enhance communication among key stakeholders...|$|R
