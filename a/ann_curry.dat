25|$|On October 2, 2000, NBC {{expanded}} Today {{to three}} hours, {{with the addition}} of an hour from 9:00 to 10:00a.m. For its first twelve years, the format of the third hour was originally structured similarly to Todays first two hours, using the same anchors as that portion of the broadcast; separate anchors began to be used for the third hour over time, with only the news anchor (<b>Ann</b> <b>Curry</b> until 2011, then Natalie Morales) and the weather anchor (Al Roker) being shared with the main 7:00 to 9:00a.m. block – this was particularly the case during instances where Matt Lauer and/or his co-host (Katie Couric, then Meredith Vieira from 2006 to 2011, <b>Ann</b> <b>Curry</b> from 2011 to 2012 and finally Savannah Guthrie during the final months of the original format) could not be present for the entire hour due to reporting assignments or personal commitments. Vieira, outside of breaking news situations, was specifically disallowed by contract from any duties in the third hour due to her hosting commitments to the syndicated version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? by Buena Vista/Disney–ABC Domestic Television.|$|E

25|$|Amid declining ratings at Today in the {{aftermath}} of reports of Matt Lauer's alleged role in <b>Ann</b> <b>Curry's</b> departure as co-host (though ratings had been in a steady decline for that program during Curry's co-hosting tenure), viewership for Good Morning America increased starting in 2012. The program beat Today {{for the first time in}} 16 years during the week of April 9, 2012, ending that program's streak of 852 consecutive weeks as the most-watched network morning news program, by a margin of 31,000 more viewers than the NBC program.

25|$|Alexander Parks {{and others}} have {{identified}} libraries as potentially important safe places for LGBTQ youth and teens, especially {{in the face of}} bullying. He suggests the inclusion of LGBTQ titles in library displays or book talks to promote greater visibility. However, according to an 2005 study by <b>Ann</b> <b>Curry,</b> though many LGBTQ teens have the very similar concerns to their adult counterparts, librarians often do not answer their questions related to LGBTQ topics in a sensitive or welcoming manner. Studies by Carmichael and Greenblatt have emphasized that the library is an important place for teens who are coming out to find information because of the potential anonymity it provides. In his examination of public libraries in areas with large concentrations of same-sex families, Naidoo finds that many children's librarians are unaware of the LGBTQ families in their community and provide a mixed-bag of services, collections, and programs.|$|E
500|$|... "You and I", {{written by}} Lady Gaga and {{produced}} by Gaga and Robert John [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, {{was one of}} the first songs previewed from the album. Gaga said she wrote the song in New York, while she was busy playing her old piano. The singer first played [...] "You and I" [...] at Elton John's White Tie and Tiara Ball in June 2010. She said that the song was a bit of a [...] "rock-and-roll tune" [...] and, as such, was unlikely to be released as a single from Born This Way. She said [...] that it [...] " [...] is very dear" [...] to her heart. Footage of the performance appeared on the Internet soon after, and positive response encouraged Lady Gaga to perform the song during the first concert of the North American leg of The Monster Ball Tour in Montreal. Gaga told MSNBC's Meredith Vieira and <b>Ann</b> <b>Curry</b> that [...] "'You and I' was written about the most important person that I ever met", allegedly Lüc Carl, her ex-boyfriend.|$|E
500|$|The Ad Council {{claimed the}} poster was {{developed}} in 1942 by its precursor, the War Advertising Committee, {{as part of a}} [...] "Women in War Jobs" [...] campaign, helping to bring [...] "over two million women" [...] into war production. In February 2012 during the Ad Council's 70th anniversary celebration, an interactive application designed by Animax's HelpsGood digital agency was linked to the Ad Council's Facebook page. The Facebook app was called [...] "Rosify Yourself", referring to Rosie the Riveter; it allowed viewers to upload images of their faces to be incorporated into the [...] "We Can Do It!" [...] poster, then saved to be shared with friends. Ad Council President and CEO Peggy Conlon posted her own [...] "Rosified" [...] face on Huffington Post in an article she wrote about the group's 70-year history. The staff of the television show Today posted two [...] "Rosified" [...] images on their website, using the faces of news anchors Matt Lauer and <b>Ann</b> <b>Curry.</b> However, Seton Hall University professor James J. Kimble and University of Pittsburgh professor Lester C. Olson researched the origins of the poster and determined that it was not produced by the Ad Council nor was it used for recruiting women workers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ann</b> <b>Curry's</b> final show as co-anchor was subdued {{compared}} to the earlier departures of Katie Couric and Meredith Vieira, as it did not include retrospectives of Curry's 15-year run on the program or goodbye messages from colleagues and celebrities, although Curry – seated alongside Lauer, Natalie Morales and Al Roker in the couch area of the Studio 1A set – gave a tear-filled farewell message to viewers. Rumors of Curry's departure from Today began weeks before NBC formally announced that she {{would no longer be}} co-host, spurring negative press similar to that resulting from the departure of Jane Pauley and her replacement by Deborah Norville 23 years earlier, as since disproven reports suggested that Matt Lauer had a hand in the program's decision to let Curry go. Viewership declines for the program that began in the months following Curry becoming co-host precipitated in part due to public criticism over Lauer's alleged involvement in Curry's departure; loyal viewers once again began turning to the competing Good Morning America, which toppled Todays 16-year consecutive run as the top-rated morning news program during the week of April 9, 2012. The public relations problems for Lauer that resulted from the accusations, led then-executive producer Jim Bell to admit responsibility for the negative press, in defense of Lauer, in a series of interviews with The New York Times, The Hollywood Reporter and the Associated Press.|$|R

Following their success, Huston and Stark went on to create Reflections in a Golden Eye (1967), based on the 1941 novel by acclaimed author Carson McCullers and starring Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor, Fat City (1972), and the commercially successful remake of Annie the musical (1982) starring Albert Finney, Carol Burnett, <b>Ann</b> Reinking, Tim <b>Curry,</b> Bernadette Peters, Geoffrey Holder, Edward Herrmann, and Aileen Quinn in her film debut.|$|R

The fourth hour does not have news or weather segments (other than local newsbreaks aired during the first half-hour on some NBC stations, provided they air the fourth hour at 10:00a.m.) or input from the earlier hosts and is structured virtually as a standalone talk show, with an opening [...] "host chat" [...] segment reminiscent of the one popularized by Gifford and Regis Philbin on Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee, as well as interviews and features focusing on entertainment, fashion and other topics aimed at female viewers.|$|E
50|$|Annie is a 1982 American musical film {{adapted from}} Broadway musical {{of the same}} name by Charles Strouse, Martin Charnin and Thomas Meehan, which in turn is based on Little Orphan Annie, the 1924 comic strip by Harold Gray.

Set during the Great Depression, the film tells the story of Annie, an orphan from New York City who is taken in by America's richest billionaire Oliver Warbucks. Filming took place for six weeks at Monmouth University in New Jersey.|$|R
2500|$|From the show's inception, {{the idea}} of {{providing}} the latest news headlines has been critical to {{the function of the}} program. In that vein, there has always been at least one person on set {{whose job it is to}} prepare and deliver newscasts. In 1952, that person was called the [...] "news editor" [...] or (informally) [...] "news chief." [...] In modern parlance, the term [...] "newsreader" [...] or [...] "news anchor" [...] is preferred. Under the two-hour format, four newscasts were delivered, once every half-hour. Presently, there are only two newscasts, delivered at the top of each of the first two hours. Some anchors, including Jim Fleming, Lew Wood, Floyd Kalber and John Palmer, were seasoned journalists before joining the program. Others, including <b>Ann</b> <b>Curry,</b> have used the position to increase their journalistic acumen, at times leaving the newsdesk behind to venture into the field.

In 1989, Emil Guillermo, a Filipino American born reporter from San Francisco, became the first Asian American male to co-host a national news show when he was senior host at National Public Radio's [...] "All Things Considered." [...] In 1990, Sheryl WuDunn, a foreign correspondent in the Beijing Bureau of The New York Times, became the first Asian American to win a Pulitzer Prize. <b>Ann</b> <b>Curry</b> joined NBC News as a reporter in 1990, later becoming prominently associated with The Today Show in 1997. Carol Lin is perhaps best known for being the first to break the news of 9-11 on CNN. Dr. Sanjay Gupta is currently CNN's chief health correspondent. Lisa Ling, a former co-host on The View, now provides special reports for CNN and The Oprah Winfrey Show, as well as hosting National Geographic Channel's Explorer.
