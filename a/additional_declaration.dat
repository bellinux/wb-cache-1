40|$|Introduction: {{we present}} the first {{qualitative}} {{steps in the}} adaptation and validation of an observational tool for father-mother-infant interactions in adolescence. It develops from the Lausanne Trilogue Play application (Fivaz-Depeursinge and Corboz-Warnery, 1999) to adolescent patients in a Neuropsychiatric Unit for Children and Adolescents project: ―LTP used as a psychodiagnostic and therapeutic tool for psychiatric children and adolescents‖. Our aim {{is to find out}} relevant changes to the LTP and to the Family Alliance Assessment Scales (FAAS 6. 3, Favez, Lavanchy Scaiola, Tissot, Darwiche, Frascarolo, 2011) in order to fit families with adolescents interactive peculiarities. Methods: 66 families with pre-adolescents (n = 34, 11 - 14 years old) and adolescents (n = 32, 15 - 18 years old). Observation and study of relevant communication skills, non verbal language and interactive dynamics in adolescence. Adjustment of setting, activity and scoring system. Results: setting change only for the presence of the table between the family partners. Concerning to the activity it seems that a conversational theme as weekend organization or birthday party involve all the families partners. Analysing each LTP variables we have noticed that for some of these it seems to be important to insert some <b>additional</b> <b>declaration</b> in the coding system. In particular for ―postures and looks‖ both for the presence of the table and in line with adolescent communication and non- verbal signals; for ―roles‖ in line with the more active contribution of the adolescent to the activity and to the family system than the infant do; ―co-construction and scaffolding‖ variables characteristics are modulated to adolescents peculiarities focusing both on verbal and non-verbal language. Finally a deep discussion is emerged about the modulation of affective variables concerning to the high level of conflict, a central characteristic of individuation-separation process in adolescence.

40|$|We {{investigate}} type inference {{for programming}} languages with subtypes. As described in previous work, {{there are several}} type inference problems for anygiven expression language, depending on {{the form of the}} subtype partial order andtheability todefine newsubtypes in programs. Our first main result is that foranyspecific subtype partial order, the problem of determining whether alambda term is typable is algorithmically (polynomial-time) equivalent to a form of satisfiability problem over thesame partial order. This gives the first exact characterization of the problem that is independent of the syntax of expressions. In addition, since this form of satisfiability problem is l%p, 4 CE-hard over certain partial orders, this equivalence strengthens the previous lower bound of iw’-hard to pspAcE-hard. Our second main result is a lower bound on the length of most general types when the subtype hierarchy may change as a result of <b>additional</b> type <b>declarations</b> within the program. More specifically, given any input expression, a type inference algorithm tries to find a most general (or prtncipal) typing. The prop-erty of a most general typing is that it has all other possible typings as instances. However, there are several sound notions of instance in the presence of subtyping. Our lower bound is that no sound definition of instance would allow the set of additional subtyping hypotheses about a term to grow less than linearly {{in the size of the}} term...|$|R

40|$|The 2009 Terezin Declaration on Holocaust Era Assets is the {{international}} community’s latest effort to effectuate the return of looted artworks to victims of Nazispoliation. However, over the past years, U. S. courts have shown little difficulty in brushing aside these high-flown international commitments when denying yet another claim for recovery. This Article analyzes the tenuousness of public international law arguments in disputes seeking restitution of looted artwork from U. S. museums. It interprets the imperviousness of the U. S. courts to these international agreements {{as a result of}} their non-self-executing nature, their reticent implementation in domestic law and the private status of the leading American art museums. Thereupon, this Article exposes the hypocrisy of the American policy towards art restitution by contrasting the above analysis with the United States’ strongly proclaimed support of restitution efforts and exacting attitude towards other countries. Taking into consideration the participation of the majority of European countries in {{the international}} art restitution agreements of Washington, Vilnius and Terezin, this Article compares the U. S. position with the often denounced European reticence regarding the restitution of stolen artworks. The analysis will reveal that the U. S. denunciation of the European position is not only inappropriate given its own shortcomings, but also inaccurate taking into account the serious restitutional efforts displayed in a number of West European countries. The article’s final purpose is to argue that there is no need for <b>additional</b> nonbinding <b>declarations</b> regarding Nazi-era art looting, as long as existing international framework has not been sufficiently implemented. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{coding system}} under {{consideration}} for the Galileo S-band low-gain antenna mission is a concatenated system using a variable redundancy Reed-Solomon outer code and a (14, 1 / 4) convolutional inner code. The 8 -bit Reed-Solomon symbols are interleaved to depth 8, and the eight 255 -symbol codewords in each interleaved block have redundancies 64, 20, 20, 20, 64, 20, 20, and 20, respectively (or equivalently, the codewords have 191, 235, 235, 235, 191, 235, 235, and 235 8 -bit information symbols, respectively). This concatenated code is to be decoded by an enhanced decoder that utilizes a maximum likelihood (Viterbi) convolutional decoder; a Reed Solomon decoder capable of processing erasures; an algorithm for declaring erasures in undecoded codewords based on known erroneous symbols in neighboring decodable words; a second Viterbi decoding operation (redecoding) constrained to follow only paths consistent with the known symbols from previously decodable Reed-Solomon codewords; and a second Reed-Solomon decoding operation using the output from the Viterbi redecoder and <b>additional</b> erasure <b>declarations</b> to the extent possible. It is estimated that this code and decoder can achieve a decoded bit error rate of 1 x 10 (exp 7) at a concatenated code signal-to-noise ratio of 0. 76 dB. By comparison, a threshold of 1. 17 dB is required for a baseline coding system consisting of the same (14, 1 / 4) convolutional code, a (255, 223) Reed-Solomon code with constant redundancy 32 also interleaved to depth 8, a one-pass Viterbi decoder, and a Reed Solomon decoder incapable of declaring or utilizing erasures. The relative gain of the enhanced system is thus 0. 41 dB. It is predicted from analysis based on an assumption of infinite interleaving that the coding gain could be further improved by approximately 0. 2 dB if four stages of Viterbi decoding and four levels of Reed-Solomon redundancy are permitted. Confirmation of this effect and specification of the optimum four-level redundancy profile for depth- 8 interleaving is currently being done...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of strengthened safeguards measures creates {{a wealth of}} information including AP declarations, complementary access reports, inspectors' reports and Open Source information. Often, the information is scattered in different databases and document repositories. Therefore, efficient nuclear safeguards require an information platform integrating the collection, management and analysis of all relevant data. Since most safeguards relevant information has a geographical component (e. g. sites, buildings, mines), Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are suitable tools for satisfying the needs of a safeguards information system: the geographical features in the GeoDatabase are used to associate different data items in the distributed databases; the map-based interface allows to intuitively browse, query and find the information of interest, thus providing a single-point-of-entry. Over the last years, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) has developed a number of tools supporting the preparation, management and verification of AP declarations, which were demonstrating the usefulness of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for this purpose. Following these experiences, JRC in collaboration with DG-TREN developed SIT-ES, a Geo-Portal integrating the diverse safeguards-related databases at DG-TREN and providing a single point of access to all relevant information. SIT-ES allows DG-TREN users to have fast and direct access to information related to a particular facility or activity. The possibility to intuitively browse a map-based interface and quickly find the required information is essential for verifying the information and documentation efficiently and accurately. The paper will present the SIT-ES architecture, its main reporting capabilities in answering to clarification requests from IAEA or other interested parties, and will describe the main operational features: •SIT-ES is a Geo-Portal, which provides an intuitive, map-based interface to access Safeguards related information through a geographic location on the map; •It integrates different existing databases at DG-TREN and provides central access to the distributed information.

40|$|Developing a Scale for Assessing the Forensic Experience of Recovery: the SAFER {{questionnaire}} and Clinical Research Portfolio Abstract Background: A conceptual framework of recovery was developed through systematic identification of five key processes - Connectedness, hope/optimism, identity, meaning {{in life and}} empowerment (CHIME). There are increasing efforts to implement recovery focused interventions in forensic setting. To date {{there has not been}} a self-report recovery measure developed for this population. Aims: The primary aim was to develop a self-report recovery measure for forensic service-users, conceptually based on the Good Lives Model (GLM) of offender rehabilitation and the CHIME model of recovery. Secondary aims were to explore the concurrent validity, test-retest reliability and internal consistency of the measure. Method: The processes of recovery outlined in CHIME and the description of primary goods from the GLM were explored to identify overlapping constructs. When researchers reached a consensus on the connection between constructs, items for the questionnaire were developed. The questionnaire was titled SAFER (The Scale for Assessing the Forensic Experience of Recovery). A cross-sectional pilot study was devised to evaluate concurrent validity, test-retest reliability and internal consistency of the SAFER. Results: Forty-six forensic inpatients in low, medium and high secure facilities participated. Results show the SAFER had concurrent validity, good test-retest reliability and internal consistency.

40|$|Gaseous {{uranium hexafluoride}} (UF 6) {{is used for}} the {{enrichment}} of uranium and is known to be a very reactive and volatile gas. When a small amount of UF 6 is released in the environment, it forms uranium oxyfluoride (UO 2 F 2) particles and hydrogen fluoride from the reaction with atmospheric moisture. The UO 2 F 2 particles settle on various surfaces within the enrichment facility where they are collected by safeguards organizations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) through a technique called environmental sampling. Despite their small size, the uranium isotopic composition of these particles is used to determine whether an enrichment facility is compliant with its <b>declarations.</b> <b>Additional</b> and complementary information on the particles’ source, formation process and exposure history can be obtained from elemental, molecular and morphological analysis. As fluorine is not always detected in uranium particles originating from enrichment facilities, it is assumed that UO 2 F 2 is unstable under certain environmental conditions. This study aims to determine how those environmental conditions affect the relative amount of fluorine in UO 2 F 2 particles. Expressly {{for the purpose of this}} work, we prepared a set of UO 2 F 2 particle samples from the hydrolysis of UF 6 and stored these samples in environmental chambers at different temperature, humidity and lighting conditions. The NanoSIMS secondary ion mass spectrometer, with a nanometer-scale spatial resolution, was used to measure the F+/U+ secondary ion ratio of individual particles immediately after sample preparation, and at different time intervals. NanoSIMS analyses on single particles stored up to 7 months in dry air did not detect a significant decrease in the relative amount of fluorine. The exposure to high humidity however, resulted in a much lower F+/U+ ratio, up to 2 orders of magnitude belowthat of the particles stored in dry air. It should be noted that fluorine was still detected in these samples, even after 7 months of high humidity exposure. JRC. D. 2 -Standards for Innovation and sustainable Developmen...|$|R
