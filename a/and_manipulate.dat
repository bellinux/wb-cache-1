5|$|A {{flashback}} {{reveals that}} before the Joker died, his infected blood was used in blood transfusions, infecting five people including Batman; Batman, concealing his infection from others, imprisoned the four other recipients who were physically and mentally transforming into the Joker. The Joker, now existing as a mental projection produced by the infected blood and fear toxin, frequently appears to taunt Batman, <b>and</b> <b>manipulate</b> his perception {{of the world around}} him. After Batman escapes the exploding Ace Chemicals, he alerts Gordon to Oracle's kidnapping, who angrily leaves to find Scarecrow.|$|E

5|$|Campaigns in From Dust are {{structured}} as {{a sequence of}} missions, whereby completing certain objectives expedites the tribe's progress and bestows additional powers, such as the capacity to jellify water. Tribal shamans alert the player to natural disasters, notably tsunamis and volcanic eruptions, shortly before they occur. These disasters can be inhibited through creative, physical manipulation of the environment: a tsunami can be jellified, wildfires extinguished, and lava flows diverted. Although there is no 'explicit sandbox' mode, Chahi stated that each mission features a distinct map, which the player can return to <b>and</b> <b>manipulate</b> further.|$|E
5|$|Dyrwood is cursed by the Hollowborn Plague: {{children}} are being born without souls, leaving them totally unresponsive in a way similar to a permanent vegetative state. Many people blame animancers, the scientists who study <b>and</b> <b>manipulate</b> souls. Investigating the curse, the Watcher discovers that the Hollowborns' souls have in fact been stolen by a cult known as the Leaden Key, led by a priest named Thaos, and that Thaos is framing animancers for the Plague. This eventually leads to a riot {{in the capital city}} where animancers are lynched and their college is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell Gourley {{was born}} in Geelong, Victoria, on 2 June 1991. He was born a {{congenital}} amputee, with his left forearm ending a few inches below his elbow. Mitchell can move the tiny stump of his forearm and uses it to hold <b>and</b> <b>manipulate</b> objects by gripping them in his elbow. He plays a variety of sports including cricket, Australian rules football, basketball, mountain biking and rock-climbing. He attended at Geelong College, and as of 2014 is studying commerce at the University of Melbourne.|$|E

5|$|An {{original}} non-canon story {{set in the}} legendarium {{created by}} J. R. R. Tolkien, the game takes place between the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. The player controls Talion, a Ranger who bonds with the wraith of the Elf Lord Celebrimbor, as the two set out to avenge {{the deaths of the}}ir loved ones. Players can engage in melee combat, and use wraith abilities to fight <b>and</b> <b>manipulate</b> enemies. The game introduces the Nemesis System, which allows the artificial intelligence of non-playable characters to remember the deaths of the game's protagonist and react accordingly.|$|E
5|$|Individuals who are {{intentional}} {{in their}} actions display regularity in their behavior. Individuals locate objects with their eyes, move towards the object, {{and then use}} hands {{to make contact with}} <b>and</b> <b>manipulate</b> the object. Change in gaze direction is one of several behavioral cues that individuals use in combination with changes in facial and vocal displays and body posture to mark the intention to act on an object. Individuals who seek or follow a joint focus of attention display knowledge that what is in their awareness is also in another's awareness. They believe that they are experiencing the same world as others.|$|E
5|$|Magic in Vagrant Story {{is learned}} {{later in the}} game using Grimoires that are dropped by enemies. Once a Grimoire is used, the magic spell {{associated}} with the Grimoire {{will remain in the}} menu, and players only need to spend magic points (MP) to cast a learned spell. Magic spells can be used to attack, heal, create status effects, <b>and</b> <b>manipulate</b> Ashley's elemental and enemy affinities. Certain magic spells allow the player to affect multiple targets by using a small sphere positioned within the Battle Mode wire frame. Unlike physical attacks however, magic attacks cannot be chained.|$|E

5|$|The Saturn had {{technically}} impressive hardware at {{the time}} of its release, but its complexity made harnessing this power difficult for developers accustomed to conventional programming. The greatest disadvantage was that both CPUs shared the same bus and were unable to access system memory at the same time. Making full use of the 4kB of cache memory in each CPU was critical to maintaining performance. For example, Virtua Fighter used one CPU for each character, while Nights used one CPU for 3D environments and the other for 2D objects. The Saturn's Visual Display Processor 2 (VDP2), which can generate <b>and</b> <b>manipulate</b> backgrounds, has also been cited as one of the system's most important features.|$|E
5|$|The {{executive}} {{function of the}} brain is the set of cognitive processes that allow the cognitive control of behavior: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions include the ability to filter information and tune out irrelevant stimuli with attentional control and cognitive inhibition, the ability to process <b>and</b> <b>manipulate</b> information held in working memory, {{the ability to think}} about multiple concepts simultaneously and switch tasks with cognitive flexibility, the ability to inhibit impulses and prepotent responses with inhibitory control, and the ability to determine the relevance of information or appropriateness of an action. Higher order {{executive function}}s, require multiple cognitive processes including planning, reasoning, and problem solving.|$|E
5|$|We {{shot the}} clip in mid-October {{on a cold}} day in New York City. The vibe and feeling was great... It was the first video for the album, so {{obviously}} everyone was excited and focused on setting the tone for what's to come. Rihanna and I spoke in depth about creating a piece that was gritty, raw {{and more of a}} street video then a classic beauty piece... We loved the energy and bravado of early hip-hop videos that were made without a lot of resources, working more with the textures and shapes of the surroundings, then trying to build <b>and</b> <b>manipulate</b> environments as we {{have done in the past}}... I wanted to try and take everything we have done in the past and put it to the side.|$|E

5|$|Bioinformatics {{involves}} {{the development of}} techniques to store, data mine, search <b>and</b> <b>manipulate</b> biological data, including DNA nucleic acid sequence data. These have led to widely applied advances in computer science, especially string searching algorithms, machine learning, and database theory. String searching or matching algorithms, which find an occurrence of a sequence of letters inside a larger sequence of letters, were developed to search for specific sequences of nucleotides. The DNA sequence may be aligned with other DNA sequences to identify homologous sequences and locate the specific mutations that make them distinct. These techniques, especially multiple sequence alignment, are used in studying phylogenetic relationships and protein function. Data sets representing entire genomes' worth of DNA sequences, such as those produced by the Human Genome Project, are difficult to use without the annotations that identify the locations of genes and regulatory elements on each chromosome. Regions of DNA sequence that have the characteristic patterns associated with protein- or RNA-coding genes can be identified by gene finding algorithms, which allow researchers to predict the presence of particular gene products and their possible functions in an organism even before they have been isolated experimentally. Entire genomes may also be compared, which can {{shed light on the}} evolutionary history of particular organism and permit the examination of complex evolutionary events.|$|E
5|$|Halo 3 {{contains}} non-gameplay additions, such as Forge, a map-editing tool. Forge enables {{players to}} insert and remove game objects, such as weapons, crates and vehicles into existing multiplayer maps. Almost all weapons, vehicles, and interactive objects {{can be placed}} and moved on maps with Forge. Players can enter Forge games and edit <b>and</b> <b>manipulate</b> objects in real time. A budget limits the amount of objects that can be placed. Players may also save up to 100 films of gameplay to their Xbox 360's hard drive, viewing the action from any angle and at different speeds. Halo 3 offers a form of file sharing, where items such as saved films, screenshots, and custom variants can all be uploaded to Bungie's official website, Bungie.net. Anyone can browse user created content that has been uploaded to Bungie's website and tag it to automatically download to their console next time they sign into Xbox Live on Halo 3.|$|E
