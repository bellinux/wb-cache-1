40|$|Prague <b>Appeal</b> <b>Chamber</b> (niem. Appellationsgericht, czes. Apelačni soud) {{was brought}} into being by an {{instruction}} of Ferdinand I in January 1548. Since that year, everyone who was not satisfied with a verdict of a town council or court, which verdicts were not decisive since then, from any royal town could appeal to Prague <b>Appeal</b> <b>Chamber</b> through town council. It dealt mainly with civil and criminal cases or advised in lawsuits. It may suggest, that from Silesian town courts there were mostly sent documents of cases concerning those matters. As it was defined, to Prague <b>Appeal</b> <b>Chamber</b> there were directed cases regarded as important, difficult or dubious. However, it occurred that Prague Court received to consider cases which today would be recognized as highly controversial or even beyond belief. Prague <b>Appeal</b> <b>Chamber</b> also dealt with reviews of privileges possessed by towns (chiefly concerning judiciary matters). Such reviews, for example, took place in 1709 and 1722.

50|$|On 15 August 2001, Counsel for Krstić filed {{a notice}} of appeal against the Trial Chamber judgement, arguing that the Trial Chamber both misconstrued the legal {{definition}} of genocide and erred in applying the definition to several circumstances of the case.

With regard to factual errors, the <b>Appeal's</b> <b>Chamber</b> on 19 April 2004 dismissed the appeal on some issues, but granted it with regard to other issues. They pronounced him not guilty of genocide, but affirmed his guilt as an aider and abbetor to genocide, thus redefining Krstić's involvement and cutting 11 years from his sentence.|$|R

In 2009, however, the ICTY <b>Appeals</b> <b>Chamber</b> overturned Milošević's conviction for the 28 August 1995 shelling of the Markale Market because at that time Milošević was in hospital in Belgrade, so that his deputy commander Čedomir Sladoje should in fact be considered responsible for the shelling.

25|$|On 28 June 2012 the Trial Chamber {{made its}} oral ruling on motion for a {{judgement}} of acquittal, pursuant to Rule 98 bis of the Tribunal’s Rules of Procedure and Evidence, where it granted Karadžić's motion {{in relation to}} count one of the indictment {{in which he was}} charged with genocide for the crimes committed between 31 March 1992 and 31 December 1992 in several municipalities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, leaving only the case of Srebrenica as a count of genocide. On 11 July 2013 the <b>Appeals</b> <b>Chamber</b> reversed the Trial Chamber's acquittal of Karadžić for genocide under Count 1 of the Indictment, and remanded the matter to the Trial Chamber. The <b>Appeals</b> <b>Chamber</b> found that the Trial Chamber erred in fact in concluding that there was no evidence, taken at its highest, based upon which a reasonable trier of fact could be satisfied that Karadžić and other alleged JCE members possessed genocidal intent, and that this error resulted in a miscarriage of justice.|$|E

The author of the present paper discusses the judicial reasoning provided by the <b>Appeals</b> <b>Chambers</b> of the ICTY before the Perišić Appeal Judgement was delivered and demonstrates how negligence of judicial chambers can build case law which leaves the door wide open to highly debatable judicial conclusions.

25|$|Foreign {{volunteers in}} Bosnia {{have been accused}} of {{committing}} war crimes during the conflict. However, the ICTY has never issued indictments against mujahideen fighters. Instead, the ICTY indicted some Bosnian Army commanders on the basis of superior criminal responsibility. The ICTY acquitted Amir Kubura and Enver Hadžihasanović of the Bosnian 3rd Corps of all charges related to the incidents involving mujahideen. Furthermore, the <b>Appeals</b> <b>Chamber</b> noted that the relationship between the 3rd Corps and the El Mujahedin detachment was not one of subordination but was instead close to overt hostility since the only way to control the detachment was to attack {{them as if they were}} a distinct enemy force.|$|E

There were reports in the media that Tuđman himself participated in the coverup. The <b>appeals</b> <b>chamber</b> of the ICTY ruled that Blaškić did not have command responsibility for the massacre and lowered the initial sentence (in 2000) of 45 years to nine years of imprisonment.

25|$|Momcilo Krajisnik {{was indicted}} by the ICTY and accused of genocide, {{complicity}} in genocide, {{crimes against humanity}} (namely extermination, murder, persecution, deportation, and forced transfer), and various war crimes, in relation to acts committed in 1992 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was arrested on April 3, 2000 by SFOR. After the death of Slobodan Milosevic, Krajisnik was the highest-ranking politician on trial at the ICTY. On 27 September 2006, Krajisnik was convicted of the following crimes against humanity: extermination, murder, persecution, deportation, and forced transfer. He was acquitted of the charges of murder as a war crime, genocide, and complicity in genocide. He was sentenced to 27 years imprisonment. On 17 March 2009 the ICTY <b>Appeals</b> <b>Chamber</b> reversed some of the Trial Chamber's convictions for crimes against humanity and reduced Krajisnik's sentence to 20 years.

25|$|Goran Jelisic, in 1999, {{pleaded guilty}} to the charges of crimes against {{humanity}} and violating the laws and customs of war and {{pleaded not guilty to}} genocide. The Trial Chamber found that, despite discriminatory intent and the commission of acts within the definition of the actus reus of genocide, Jelisić did not have the requisite intent to destroy {{in whole or in part}} the Muslim group from Brčko. He was sentenced to 40 years imprisonment. The <b>Appeals</b> <b>Chamber,</b> among other things, held that the Trial Chamber’s erroneous application of the standard under Rule 98 bis(B) led to an incorrect assessment of the evidence as insufficient to sustain a conviction for genocide, but it did not consider it appropriate to reverse the acquittal and to remit the case for further proceedings, since a retrial would only be limited to the question of whether Jelisić possessed the genocidal intent, and thus it affirmed the sentence. On 29 May 2003, Jelisić was transferred to Italy to serve the remainder of his sentence with credit for time served since his arrest on 22 January 1998.|$|E
