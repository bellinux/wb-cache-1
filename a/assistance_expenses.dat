40|$|In Japan, {{the aging}} of public {{facilities}} constructed {{during the period of}} high economic growth is progressing. While huge renewal investment is anticipated in the future, in addition to the reduction in tax revenues, the increase in <b>assistance</b> <b>expenses</b> etc. is expected to rise rapidly and there is concern that renewal and repair expenses will be secured. Furthermore, it is necessary to deal with the falling birthrate and the aging population and corresponding changes in the facility functions required. In response to these challenges, it was urgent to introduce "public facility management", which is a mechanism for comprehensively grasping the public facilities they possess and managing and borrowing them in conjunction with fiscal management.

30|$|The direct {{financial}} {{consequences of}} a disability onset are dramatic – previous estimates suggest a 50 to 80 percent drop in earnings. Means-tested programs, tapping into assets, family <b>assistance</b> and lowering <b>expenses</b> are all potential ways in which one could cope with this income loss, especially before SSDI benefits kick in. While {{the relationship between the}} wait time and any particular initial or average coping strategies is largely absent, our findings suggest that SNAP is a very important coping mechanism for SSDI applicants {{over the course of the}} application. Those applicants with longer waiting durations are more likely to use SNAP benefits both as an initial and average coping strategy. This relationship has some direct policy implications. For instance, it implies that a reallocation of funds that decrease SSDI wait may decrease outlays for SNAP and therefore decreases the overall costs of reducing SSDI wait times. Thus, our findings highlight that such program interactions are important in understanding the full fiscal implications of changes to the SSDI program.|$|R

Recent changes to the Customs Act and the creation of a new Anti-Dumping Commission are designed to make it easier for Australian producers to bring anti-dumping actions against foreign producers. If this leads to a sustained increase in anti-dumping actions, it will mark the end of a downward trend in Australia’s use of anti-dumping measures since the mid- 1980 s. It will also impose growing costs on the Australian economy.

40|$|Many {{refugee camps}} today are places of {{insecurity}} and outright danger, both for refugees and relief workers, and, {{by virtue of}} their destabilizing effect, for those living around the camps. Camps are an essential element of the humanitarian response to refugees, and cannot and should not be eliminated (as has been suggested elsewhere). However, they need to be rendered secure in order {{to ensure the safety of}} displaced people and others living and working in and around the camps. During the past few decades, the main focus of the international humanitarian response in asylum countries has been to emphasize <b>assistance</b> at the <b>expense</b> of protection. Particularly in the initial emergency phase, physical assistance (“biological needs”) is given priority over protection and security concerns. It is proposed in this paper that this focus be re-directed, particularly in the contingency planning and emergency phases, so as to stress security and physical protection needs before assistance: that is, adopt a ‘security-first’ approach. Such an approach would be the basis of an overall strategy to ensure security and protection in refugee hosting areas. This strategy should be ‘regionally appropriate,’ that is, designed in accordance with the needs and capacities of the various state, international and nonstate actors that participate in the specific refugee situation. An important part of the strategy, it is argued, is the presence of a security force in the camps. Camps cannot be made secure without armed backup, but it is crucial that such a force be appropriately trained and prepared for refugee situations, and carefully controlled and monitored. The specific composition and mandate of such a force would vary from one host country to another, depending on needs and capacities...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an examination}} of influences that {{have contributed to the}} retention of a group of minority students attending a predominately white postsecondary institution. The focus of the study is on the students 2 ̆ 7 perspectives and the meaning and personal interpretation students draw from influences that impinge upon them and from their interactions with the college experience. From a sociological perspective this view and emphasis on meaning is described as the sociology of everyday life. The component of the sociology of everyday life which directed the methodology is symbolic interactionism. The data collection instrument was a focused interview. Variables from the Metzner and Bean (1987) Conceptual Model of Nontraditional Student Attrition and Tinto (1987) Student Integration Model served as the starting point for the formation of the open-ended questions. The selected group of students were participants in a collaborative program between a school district, a community college, and a state university designed to encourage minorities to pursue careers in education. Twelve out of 25 qualified participants volunteered for the study. They represented a heterogeneous group of African-American, Hispanic-American, and Asian-American students. The data indicated that while the students had divergent family and educational experiences prior to entering the college, certain circumstances took place that were in many instances similar. The findings were multifaceted and represent institutional, environmental, and personal influences. Institutional influences included the encouragement of faculty and staff, introduction of college as a choice either early in their lives or when they were ready to make career changes, academic supports, ethnic and multicultural studies, a familiar site on campus to go for assistance, and the availability of supportive administrators and faculty. Environmental influences included familiarity with the lack of employment opportunities without a college degree, and experience in racially integrated environments. Personal influences included <b>assistance</b> with college <b>expenses</b> from a family member, awareness of the economic limitations without advanced training, and personal commitment and determination to persist.

40|$|Cataract is {{the most}} common cause of {{blindness}} in the world. Epidemiologic studies have shown that the etiology of cataract is multifactorial. Cataract increases with age and oxidative damage to the lens proteins is suggested to be of importance. The only currently available treatment is surgical extraction of the lens; two thirds of these operations are performed in women. Today in Sweden cataract extraction {{is the most}} common operation, with nearly 80, 000 operations being performed each year among a population of 9 million inhabitants. The number of cataract extractions has increased dramatically during the last two decades due to improvements in the operation technique leading to earlier intervention, and an increasing elderly population. Cataract involves decreased vision and deteriorated quality of life resulting in socio-economic consequences. Elderly individuals with compromised vision require <b>assistance.</b> Furthermore, <b>expenses</b> increase due to a rise in operation volumes. Therefore, finding modifiable risk factors for cataract is of public health importance. Cigarette smoking, UV-exposure, diabetes and steroid medication have been associated with cataract in previous studies. Alcohol consumption, abdominal adiposity, hypertension and postmenopausal hormone therapy may be associated with cataract development. Dietary patterns and vitamin supplement use could also be of importance. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the association between smoking intensity; smoking cessation; alcohol consumption; metabolic syndrome with its components of abdominal adiposity, diabetes and hypertension; and postmenopausal hormone therapy, with the incidence of age-related cataract extraction among women in the Swedish Mammography Cohort (SMC). About 35, 000 women in the cohort (born 1914 - 48) and living in Västmanland and Uppsala county, filled in a mailed questionnaire on diet, height, weight and lifestyle factors in 1997. During the study period, September 1997 until October 2005, a total of 4, 508 incident cases of age-related cataract extraction were identified by linking the study cohort, using personal identification number, with computerized registers of cataract extraction in the two counties. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate relative risk as rate ratio (RR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) adjusted for potential confounders. Smoking was associated with a 17 % increased risk of cataract extraction with a significant dose-response for intensity of smoking, measured as the average number of cigarettes smoked per day during smoking life-time. Quitting smoking predicted reduced risk over time, but a longer time was needed for those with a higher smoking intensity. Alcohol consumption was associated with a modest (10 %) increased risk of cataract extraction. The risk increased with increasing alcohol consumption. An increment of alcohol consumption with 1 alcoholic drink per day (equivalent to 13 gram alcohol per day), was associated with a 7 % increased risk of cataract extraction. Women who smoked as well as used alcohol had cataract extractions five years earlier than women who did neither. Abdominal adiposity (waist circumference >= 80 cm), diabetes and hypertension were positively associated with risk of cataract extraction, the observed risk being 8 %, 43 % and 12 % respectively. Women with all three component of the metabolic syndrome had an even greater risk (68 %); those younger than 65 years of age had an almost 3 fold increased risk of cataract extraction associated with the metabolic syndrome. Current use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) among postmenopausal women was associated with an 18 % increased risk for cataract extraction. The risk increased with duration of HRT use. Current users of HRT consuming more than one alcoholic drink per day had an even higher risk (42 %) for cataract extraction. In conclusion, healthy life-style promotions like smoking prevention or cessation, modest alcohol consumption, and weight control, as well as a restrictive use of HRT, could delay the development of cataract...|$|R

To date, however, there has been no in-depth exploration into workers’ leave taking behavior, nor how the New Jersey Family Leave Insurance program affected families who did receive state family leave insurance. Motivation: A growing body of research demonstrates the positive outcomes associated with longer amounts of time that women stay at home with their newborns before returning to work. Despite this evidence, the United States is the only industrialized country that does not guarantee paid parental leave to care for a new child or attend to important family needs. Explorations into how family leave insurance programs affect the health, economic security, and well-being of low-income families can inform the development of evidence-based statewide and/or federal paid leave programs. Approach: Researchers recruited 42 low-income fathers and mothers in Newark, Camden, and Trenton, New Jersey to participate in focus groups and in-depth interviews. Groups were separated by gender {{and whether or not they}} took up family leave insurance after welcoming a child to their families. The research team analyzed transcripts from focus groups and interviews using Atlas. ti to organize major themes. By comparing the experiences of parents who took up leave with those who have not, we gained insight into the barriers to FLI program take up by low-income workers in New Jersey and how it affects those who did utilize FLI. Brief Results: Among those who did not utilize FLI, barriers included a lack of awareness, lack of employer support, concerns about job security, and confusion over eligibility. For those that did take it up, while they experienced difficulty navigating the application process, FLI allowed them to bond with their babies shortly after their birth with additional financial <b>assistance</b> to pay <b>expenses</b> while taking leave. Recommendations to increase FLI take up include increased investment in program outreach and administrative capacity. Conclusions: New Jersey’s FLI program has benefited low-income parents in allowing them to take leave from work to bond with their newborns, but program administration needs improvement in order to meet their needs. Improving internal efficiency to process applications and increasing awareness has the potential to increase FLI take up and improve the economic security and well-being of low-income parents and their children. More evaluations of current paid family leave programs can inform national efforts to ensure that families do not have to go without a source of income while caring for a newborn or ill family member...|$|R
40|$|The goal {{of owning}} one’s home, {{as opposed to}} ‘just renting’, is deeply {{ingrained}} in Australian culture. Indeed, home ownership in Australia is seen as ‘natural’ and has been adopted by the majority as the tenure of choice. People have accepted assumptions that have shaped housing discourse which normalises home ownership as hegemonic. In this thesis I argue that the prevailing attitude is that home ownership equates with social and personal attributes such as success, belongingness and stability, giving the home owner greater status, power and choice compared to renters. In addition, despite the various pressures faced by many home owners, home ownership can also facilitate an increased sense of community because it enables long term and secure housing. This in turn contributes {{to the notion of}} ‘home’ and sense of identity which comes through allowing people to put down deep roots and to express personal tastes. Property ownership, as the key determinant of class in Australia, separates the ‘haves’ from the ‘have nots’. However, property prices have risen beyond the means of many low income households resulting in a housing affordability crisis. This crisis has excluded some groups from achieving the sought after goal of home ownership and has left them vulnerable to the vagaries of the private rental market. Others have entered into the housing market and face financial hardship due to massive debt. Consequently, this situation has served to challenge the widely held assumption that Australia is an egalitarian society. As well, property has largely taken on the instrumental purpose of an investment opportunity rather than a place that provides the basic needs of shelter, security and a sense of belonging and wellbeing. Thus {{the very nature of the}} meaning of ‘home’ has altered in light of this situation with housing increasingly seen as a commodity. Low income, non-home owning sole mother headed families constitute a social group that is particularly vulnerable to, and disadvantaged by, their housing situation. This qualitative study draws on a critical feminist approach and utilises in-depth interviews to explore the housing experiences of thirty-two sole mother renters living in Northern NSW. Critical feminist research endeavours to present the views – the ‘voices’ - of those participating in the research. In so doing, the study fills an important gap in current housing research and facilitates a greater awareness of what it means to rent on a low income in contemporary Australia. This approach is markedly different to many utilised in housing related research which often results in the particular concerns of vulnerable social groups being indistinguishable from others that are faring well within the neo-liberal, ‘free market’ approach to housing. By also examining contemporary housing policy, such as the push towards rent <b>assistance</b> at the <b>expense</b> of social housing, along with the promotion of home ownership for those who can afford it, underlying assumptions and hidden power imbalances are made apparent. The study has found that for many of the women such policies work directly against their perceived interests as well as social and personal aspirations. A key finding is that this group is excluded from a socially desirable resource and are rendered invisible, while simultaneously being subjected to high levels of surveillance within an institutionalised culture of watching and noticing. It is argued that the challenges faced by this group of women need to be acknowledged. Policy needs to be introduced that recognises that the main function of housing should be to provide secure and stable homes for all, which after all is both a basic need and a right...|$|R
