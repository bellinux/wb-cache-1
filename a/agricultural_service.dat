According to an analysis in the USDA Foreign <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Service</b> report of 2015, it is grown as an industrial crop in 15% of the nation's land.

5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} early modern {{individuals}} experienced {{a period of}} youth in the modern sense. For many the early teens were marked by moving away from home to undertake life-cycle service, which was necessary {{so that they could}} build up skills and capital that would enable them to marry and create a separate household. Lower down in society boys might be apprenticed to a trade, or become agricultural servants. Girls might go into domestic or <b>agricultural</b> <b>service.</b> For those higher up in society and increasingly for those lower down, this might be after a period of schooling or even university.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} end of the first {{outbreak}} of the Black Death, there were efforts by the authorities to stem the upward pressure on wages and prices, with parliament passing the emergency Ordinance of Labourers in 1349 and the Statute of Labourers in 1351. The efforts to regulate the economy continued as wages and prices rose, putting pressure on the landed classes, and in 1363 parliament attempted unsuccessfully to centrally regulate craft production, trading and retailing. A rising amount of the royal courts' time was involved in enforcing the failing labour legislation – as much as 70% by the 1370s. Many land owners attempted to vigorously enforce rents payable through <b>agricultural</b> <b>service</b> rather than money through their local manor courts, leading to attempts by many village communities to legally challenge local feudal practices using the Domesday Book as a legal basis for their claims. With the wages of the lower classes still rising, the government also attempted to regulate demand and consumption by reinstating the sumptuary laws in 1363. These laws banned the lower classes from consuming certain products or wearing high-status clothes, and reflected the significance of the consumption of high-quality breads, ales and fabrics as a way of signifying social class in the late medieval period.|$|E

25|$|In 1901, when Red Deer was {{incorporated}} as a town, the population stood at 343. Through its location midway between Edmonton and Calgary and the fertile land that supported profitable mixed farming, Red Deer developed primarily as an <b>agricultural</b> <b>service</b> and distribution centre. A further boost came in 1907 {{when it was}} chosen as a major divisional point for the Canadian Pacific Railway. Two other railways, the Alberta Central Railway and the Canadian Northern Railway, entered the community in 1911. Red Deer underwent a large land boom.|$|E

International manufacturers like General Motors Holden and Chrysler made use of these factories around Adelaide, completing its transformation from an <b>agricultural</b> <b>service</b> centre to a 20th-century city. A pipeline from Mannum brought River Murray water to Adelaide in 1954 and an airport opened at West Beach in 1955.

25|$|A Medical Civic Action Program (MEDCAP) station {{manned by}} medical {{personnel}} from an American unit, aided by Vietnamese interpreters, and a dentist was brought along {{to provide health}} check-ups and treatment for the villages. The medical treatment was mainly symptomatic and for minor problems, such as aspirin for pains, soap and medication for skin diseases, and extraction for toothaches. Where more serious medical issues were diagnosed, they were referred to other facilities outside the military channels for proper treatment or corrective surgery. The Youth Service Activity entertained the children so that their parents were free {{to talk to the}} government officials present about more serious matters such as government policy. Games were played, songs were sung, candy and toys were handed out to the children, and movies were shown. At one point Colonel Ba joined the children for ballgames. The Vietnamese <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Service</b> provided information to the elders about farming and government initiatives designed to assist farmers. The American military personnel present reported that the villagers appeared to be very pleased with the information session and the free social services.|$|E
500|$|Though a bio-safety {{regulatory}} system {{was part of}} the 18th Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan that [...] "devolved" [...] several functions to the provinces, the system is still unclear with regard to regulators who can oversee the approval of new seed technologies. In this context the three regulatory acts which are under approval stage are the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act, Amendments to the 1976 Seed Act, and the Biosafety Law. According to the USDA Foreign <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Service</b> report of 2015, passage of these laws is crucial to the introduction of new biotech events.|$|E

30|$|It is also {{important}} to note that the results from this study appear to be localized and represent the specific crop growth and irrigation characteristics of the target watershed. At the provincial level, 2002 and 2003 reported the third and second highest agricultural claims for drought ($ 19.5 and $ 25  million dollars, respectively) while 2006 experienced the highest level of drought insurance claims in the province ($ 27  million dollars) (Manitoba <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Services</b> Corporation 2015). However, within the Victoria and Lorne census areas, that were the target of the present research, 2002 and 2003 received far more precipitation than in 2006 and had much lower insurance claims for drought (Manitoba <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Services</b> Corporation 2015). Drought insurance claims within the Victoria and Lorne census areas were instead higher in 2012 and 2013, which provincially saw low insurance claims ($ 18 and $ 22.5  million lower than 2006 claims, respectively) (Manitoba <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Services</b> Corporation 2015). In 2010, Manitoba saw $ 169  million in claims for flooding (the second highest between 2002 and 2014) while the Victoria and Lorne census areas did not see any claims for flooding that year (Manitoba <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Services</b> Corporation 2015).|$|R
