5|$|During the 1990s, Morrison {{developed}} a close association with two vocal talents <b>at</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> of their careers: Georgie Fame (with whom Morrison had already worked occasionally) lent {{his voice and}} Hammond organ skills to Morrison's band; and Brian Kennedy's vocals complemented the grizzled voice of Morrison, both in studio and live performances.|$|E
5|$|Both {{teams were}} {{competing}} in the Scottish First Division {{at the time of}} the final and despite being ranked <b>at</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> of the league table, St Johnstone in third and Dunfermline in ninth, both teams were in relatively bad form. St Johnstone had drawn seven games from thirteen and were nine points behind second placed Dundee; whilst Dunfermline had won only three games in thirteen and were two points off the bottom of the table. The match was the first time the clubs had met in the Challenge Cup, however, they had already played each other twice in the season in the First Division; both matches ended in 0–0 draws.|$|E

The palace, a gift from Tsar Nicholas II to his sister, now houses the Saint Petersburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Olga and Peter had {{separate}} bedrooms <b>at</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> of the building, and the Grand Duchess had her own art studio.

5|$|Amundsen did not {{publicise}} {{his change}} of plan. As Scott's biographer David Crane points out, the expedition's {{public and private}} funding was earmarked for scientific work in the Arctic; there was {{no guarantee that the}} backers would understand or agree to the proposed volte-face. Furthermore, the altered objective might cause Nansen to revoke the use of Fram, or parliament to halt the expedition for fear of undermining Scott and offending the British. Amundsen concealed his intentions from everyone except his brother Leon and his second-in-command, Nilsen. This secrecy led to awkwardness; Scott had sent Amundsen instruments to enable their two expeditions, <b>at</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> of the earth, to make comparative readings. When Scott, in Norway to test his motor sledges, telephoned Amundsen's home to discuss cooperation, the Norwegian would not take the call.|$|E
5|$|While the river, its valley, and {{the rail}} line proceed south from North Cohocton, NY21 {{turns to the}} northeast, {{ascending}} out of the valley and finally crossing the county line, at this point bordering Ontario County. The route meanders across another area of hilly, undeveloped terrain {{to the village of}} Naples, home to the north end of NY53 and the south end of NY245. NY21 meets the two routes <b>at</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> of the community, with NY53 terminating south of the village center and NY245 beginning to its north. Naples also serves as NY21's entrance to the Finger Lakes region; the village itself is located in the southernmost part of the Canandaigua Lake valley.|$|E

Later, he gets back to her house again, but Stan closes the door in his face. Subsequently, she is portrayed traveling with a red car previously shown in the beginning, arriving at an old vehicle and holding a bird on her arm. Over {{the rest of the}} music video, the singer is shown meeting her love interest face to face two more times, including a performance of the song to a bar's crowd in which he is featured, sporting a white dress and head accessory. Her suitor ends struggling with alcohol issues. Scenes interspersed through the main video present the singer laying over the abandoned vehicle, and playing the piano in her room.|$|E

25|$|A third complex {{consists}} of species with rather large, openly coiled to nearly planispiral shells with pronounced prickly sculpture and widely expanded outer lips; the shells are often strongly patterned. The group contains Abbottella haitensis, and Abbottella moreletianus. Bartsch (1946) broke Abbottella moreletianus into five subspecies. Zoogeographically, this group presents a problem: {{the two species}} occur <b>at</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>ends</b> of the island (Thomazeau, Haiti and the Samaná Peninsula and environs).

The established arrangement was that single men were quartered in the forward areas, while single women, married couples and families were quartered aft. In addition, while other ships provided only open berth sleeping arrangements, White Star Line vessels provided their Third Class passengers with private, small but comfortable cabins capable of accommodating two, four, six, eight and 10 passengers.|$|E
