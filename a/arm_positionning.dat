Identified risk factors in professional musicians include posture, <b>arm</b> <b>position</b> and playing time. Studies in amateur musicians are limited. Two questions are addressed: (1) {{what is the difference}} in prevalence of CANS in amateur musicians playing in either elevated or neutral <b>arm</b> <b>position?</b> (2) What is the association between duration of playing time per week and CANS? Methods: Cross-sectional survey in amateur musicians. Evaluated were background, instrument and musculoskeletal complaints. Respondents were categorized by arm position; neutral versus elevated (≥ 40 ° abduction and/or flexion (one- or two-sided)). The groups were compared using T-test, Chi Square test and Mann Whitney U Test. Multiple logistic regression analysis modeled playing time as predictor of CANS. Results: Available for analyses were 162 amateur musicians, of which 46. 9 % played with elevated <b>arm</b> <b>position.</b> The point-prevalence of CANS was 24. 4 % in neutral <b>arm</b> <b>position</b> and 15. 8 % in elevated position (Odds ratio (OR) 0. 41 (p= 0. 06).

40|$|Abstract Background Electromyography (EMG) pattern-recognition based control {{strategies}} for multifunctional myoelectric prosthesis {{systems have been}} studied commonly in a controlled laboratory setting. Before these myoelectric prosthesis systems are clinically viable, {{it will be necessary}} to assess the effect of some disparities between the ideal laboratory setting and practical use on the control performance. One important obstacle is the impact of <b>arm</b> <b>position</b> variation that causes the changes of EMG pattern when performing identical motions in different <b>arm</b> <b>positions.</b> This study aimed to investigate the impacts of <b>arm</b> <b>position</b> variation on EMG pattern-recognition based motion classification in upper-limb amputees and the solutions for reducing these impacts. Methods With five unilateral transradial (TR) amputees, the EMG signals and tri-axial accelerometer mechanomyography (ACC-MMG) signals were simultaneously collected from both amputated and intact arms when performing six classes of arm and hand movements in each of five <b>arm</b> <b>positions</b> that were considered in the study. The effect of the <b>arm</b> <b>position</b> changes was estimated in terms of motion classification error and compared between amputated and intact arms. Then the performance of three proposed methods in attenuating the impact of <b>arm</b> <b>positions</b> was evaluated. Results With EMG signals, the average intra-position and inter-position classification errors across all five <b>arm</b> <b>positions</b> and five subjects were around 7. 3 % and 29. 9 % from amputated arms, respectively, about 1. 0 % and 10 % low in comparison with those from intact arms. While ACC-MMG signals could yield a similar intra-position classification error (9. 9 %) as EMG, they had much higher inter-position classification error with an average value of 81. 1 % over the <b>arm</b> <b>positions</b> and the subjects. When the EMG data from all five <b>arm</b> <b>positions</b> were involved in the training set, the average classification error reached a value of around 10. 8 % for amputated arms. Using a two-stage cascade classifier, the average classification error was around 9. 0 % over all five <b>arm</b> <b>positions.</b> Reducing ACC-MMG channels from 8 to 2 only increased the average position classification error across all five <b>arm</b> <b>positions</b> from 0. 7 % to 1. 0 % in amputated arms. Conclusions The performance of EMG pattern-recognition based method in classifying movements strongly depends on <b>arm</b> <b>positions.</b> This dependency is a little stronger in intact arm than in amputated arm, which suggests that the investigations associated with practical use of a myoelectric prosthesis should use the limb amputees as subjects instead of using able-body subjects. The two-stage cascade classifier mode with ACC-MMG for limb position identification and EMG for limb motion classification may be a promising way to reduce the effect of limb position variation on classification performance. </p...|$|R

However, it remains unknown whether these proposed approaches could also perform well in the clinical use of a multifunctional prosthesis control. In this study, the online effect of <b>arm</b> <b>position</b> variation on motion identification was evaluated by using a motion-test environment (MTE) developed to mimic the real-time control of myoelectric prostheses. The performance of different classifier configurations in reducing the impact of <b>arm</b> <b>position</b> variation was investigated using four real-time metrics based on dataset obtained from transradial amputees. The {{results of this study}} showed that, compared to the commonly used motion classification method, the CC and MPC configurations improved the real-time performance across seven classes of movements in five different <b>arm</b> <b>positions</b> (8. 7 % and 12. 7 % increments of motion completion rate, resp.).

The {{objective of this}} study is to precisely characterize the impacts of the two representative factors on myoelectric controllability in practical control situations, thereby providing useful references that can be potentially used to find better solutions for clinically reliable myoelectric control. To this end, a real-time target acquisition task was performed by fourteen subjects including one individual with congenital upper-limb deficiency, where the impacts of <b>arm</b> <b>position</b> change, donning/doffing and a combination of both factors on control performance was systematically evaluated. The changes in online performance were examined with seven different performance metrics to comprehensively evaluate various aspects of myoelectric controllability. As a result, <b>arm</b> <b>position</b> change significantly affects offline prediction accuracy, but not online control performance due to real-time feedback, thereby showing no significant correlation between offline and online performance. Donning/doffing was still problematic in online control conditions. It was further observed that no benefit was attained when using a control model trained with multiple position data in terms of <b>arm</b> <b>position</b> change, and the degree of electrode shift caused by donning/doffing was not severely associated with the degree of performance loss under practical conditions (around 1 cm electrode shift).

In the former BP was measured with the arm in two supported positions, dependent on a table (manufacturer's instructions) and horizontal (mid sternum), while the latter followed the manufacturer's instructions. Results In contrast to the dependent arm where BP was significantly higher (P< 0. 05), the horizontal <b>arm</b> <b>position</b> with the arm-cuff produced a mean systolic and diastolic BP comparable to the wrist-cuff device where the wrist was at heart level being respectively, 137 &PLUSMN; 29 / 80 &PLUSMN; 16 and 134 &PLUSMN; 27 / 77 &PLUSMN; 16 mmHg.

METHODS: Blood pressure of 128 individuals (the majority being treated hypertensive patients) visiting the outpatient clinic was measured simultaneously on both arms with arms in two different <b>positions.</b> First, both <b>arms</b> were placed at the chair support level and blood pressure was measured three times on both arms after 10 min of rest. Subsequently, while still remaining in the same sitting position, five blood pressure measurements were made simultaneously at both arms with one arm placed on the desk and one arm placed and supported at heart level (mid-sternal). The arm placed at heart level served as the reference arm. The choice of which arm was placed at desk level and which arm was placed at heart level was randomized. RESULTS: Both at desk level and at chair support level, mean (+/-SD) systolic and diastolic blood pressures were higher than blood pressure at heart level by 6. 1 / 5. 7 +/- 4. 6 / 3. 1 and 9. 3 / 9. 4 +/- 5. 4 / 3. 4 mmHg, respectively.

METHODS: Two treatment plans were made for each patient (akimbo/arms-raised); treatment was per Children’s Oncology Group AHOD 0031 protocol, including AP/PA fields. The anterior midline T 6 -T 7 disc space {{was used as an}} anatomic reference of midline. Heart/lungs were contoured for each setup. For females, breasts were also contoured and nipple positions identified. Volumetric centers of contoured organs were defined and three-dimensional distances from midline were computed. Analyzed dosimetric parameters included V 5 (volume receiving ≥ 5 Gy), V 10, V 15, V 20, and mean dose. Statistics were performed using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Fifteen (6 female, 9 male) pediatric HL patients treated with mediastinal RT were analyzed. The median lateral distance from the breast center/nipple to midline with arms akimbo was larger than that with arms raised (8. 6 vs. 7. 7 cm left breast, p= 0. 04; 10. 7 vs. 9. 2 cm left nipple, p= 0. 04; 8. 7 vs. 7. 0 cm right breast, p= 0. 004; 9. 9 vs. 7. 9 cm, p= 0. 007 right nipple).

There {{were no significant differences in}} craniocaudal breast/nipple <b>position</b> based on <b>arm</b> <b>positioning</b> (p> 0. 05). Increasing breast volume was correlated with larger arm position-related changes in breast/nipple separation (r= 0. 74, p= 0. 06 / r= 0. 85, p= 0. 02). Akimbo positioning lowered median breast V 5, V 10, V 15, and mean dose (p 0. 05). <b>Arm</b> <b>position</b> had no significant effect on cardiopulmonary doses. CONCLUSIONS: Akimbo <b>arm</b> <b>positioning</b> may be advantageous to decrease breast doses in female pediatric HL patients undergoing mediastinal RT, especially in the absence of axillary disease...|$|R
40|$|Background: {{the empty}} and full can <b>arm</b> <b>positions</b> {{are used as}} {{diagnostic}} tests and in therapeutic exercise programs for patients with subacromial impingement syndrome. the adverse effects of these <b>arm</b> <b>positions</b> on the rotator cuff have not been fully described. {{the purpose of this}} investigation was to compare the acromio-humeral distance, three-dimensional scapular position, and shoulder pain during maximum isometric contractions in the empty and full can <b>arm</b> <b>positions.</b> Methods: Subjects with subacromial impingement syndrome (n = 28) and a matched control group without shoulder pain (n = 28) participated. Acromio-humeral distance, scapular/clavicular positions and shoulder pain were measured during maximal isometric contractions in each position. Findings: No difference was found in acromio-humeral distance (P= 0314) between the <b>arm</b> <b>positions</b> or between the groups (P = 0. 598). the empty can position resulted in greater scapular upward rotation (P< 0. 001, difference = 4. 9 degrees), clavicular elevation (P< 0. 001, difference = 2. 7 degrees), clavicular protraction (P = 0. 001, difference = 2. 5 degrees) and less posterior tilt (P< 0. 001, difference = 3. 8 degrees) than the full can position. No differences in the scapular positions were found between the groups. Positive correlations were seen between the scapular positions in the control and not in the subacromial impingement group. Interpretation: Our results did not show a difference in acromio-humeral distance between the <b>arm</b> <b>positions</b> or groups, indicating that the kinematic differences between the positions are not associated with altered acromio-humeral distance. the increased pain in the EC position might be {{due to the lack of}} an association amongst the scapular positions rather than the deficiency of a single scapular motion.
