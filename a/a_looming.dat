5|$|Returning to {{his former}} seat of power, Osborn regains control of his {{business}} and also buys out the Daily Bugle, humiliating former friend and societal peer J. Jonah Jameson as he no longer has control over the newspaper. He also torments Ben Urich and demands a retraction over Urich's exposé of his time as the Green Goblin, providing faked evidence that he never was the supervillain, despite Urich's extensive research. However, he saves his most sadistic treatment for Peter, acting {{not only as a}} constant reminder of all the pain he's inflicted on his nemesis over the years, but <b>a</b> <b>looming</b> threat that could strike at any time.|$|E
5|$|In {{the face}} of <b>a</b> <b>looming</b> crisis in his career, Wills {{admitted}} to throwing in his 1870–71 Australian Cricketers' Guide, {{and in so doing}} taunted his enemies to stop him. Nonetheless, he was made Victoria XI captain for the March 1871 intercolonial against New South Wales, held at the Albert Ground. Wills' first innings top score of 39* was offset by his drunken behaviour in the field and his apparent reluctance to bowl for fear of being called. Victoria won by 48 runs. Not long after, Wills was no-balled for throwing {{for the first time in}} a club match. Rumour spread that the umpire had conspired against him with the opposing club's owner.|$|E
5|$|The British Empire was {{the largest}} on Earth, and Britain {{protected}} that empire and its trade routes with the world's largest navy. Great Britain {{assumed the role of}} peacekeeper on the world's oceans, and the Royal Navy was the instrument by which the Pax Britannica was kept. The global reach of the Royal Navy included the western Pacific Ocean, patrolled by the Australia Station. In 1887 Captain Henry Coey Kane took Calliope to the Pacific. At first assigned to the China Station, the vessel was reassigned to the Australia Station later in 1887. The cruiser was in New Zealand {{at the end of that}} year, and was the first vessel to enter the new Calliope Dock. In early 1888 Calliope was sent north to watch over <b>a</b> <b>looming</b> diplomatic crisis and potential military confrontation in Samoa.|$|E

50|$|In 1792, Dr Cartwright {{obtained}} {{his last}} patent for weaving machinery; this provided his loom with multiple shuttle boxes for weaving checks and cross stripes.However all his efforts were unavailing; {{it became apparent}} that no mechanism, however perfect, could succeed so long as warps continued to be sized while <b>a</b> <b>loom</b> was stationary. His plans for sizing them while <b>a</b> <b>loom</b> was in operation, and before being placed in <b>a</b> <b>loom,</b> failed. These problems were resolved in 1803, by William Radcliffe and his assistant Thomas Johnson, by their inventions of the beam warper, and the dressing sizing machine.|$|R
5|$|This {{area that}} is located south of the bathing complex, but no visible remains are left. According to a {{reconstruction}} of the site, this complex consisted of the complex of Pasarean Dalem Ledok Sari and the pool complex of Garjitawati with several pavilions and a garden. Pasarean Dalem Ledok Sari is {{the only part of}} the complex that is still protected. Pasarean Dalem Ledok Sari was probably used as a meditation place for the sultan, or some said as the meeting place for the sultan and his concubines. In the middle of the building was also a sleeping room for the sultan with water flowing beneath it. There was also a kitchen, <b>a</b> <b>looming</b> room, a storage, two pools for the servants, and a garden.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{participated in}} the May 15 GOP debate, where he {{discussed}} his insistence to trim bureaucracy in the federal government, and {{his support for the}} advancements made in stem cell research, lauding the achievements of the his alma mater University of Wisconsin–Madison in the field. He was asked what he would do in the event of <b>a</b> <b>looming</b> preemptive attack against a hypothetical anti-American nation promoting terrorism. The candidate quoted former Secretary of State Colin Powell reflecting the need to be sure the intelligence was correct, to deploy the right amount of troops {{and to make sure that}} an exit strategy was planned. Following the debate, Thompson campaigned in New Hampshire before taking a break for the rest of the month.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, <b>a</b> <b>looming</b> tight {{election}} saw Richardson {{tasked with}} responsibility to attract second-preference votes from the Australian Democrats {{and other environmental}} parties. Richardson claimed this as {{a major factor in}} the government's narrow re-election in 1990.|$|E
25|$|In early 2003, {{members of}} the ULA were kicked out of a reading at Housing Works in New York City for {{requesting}} a discussion of issues, including <b>a</b> <b>looming</b> war.

25|$|Born from a Brazilian {{government}} {{plan and}} having been state-run from the beginning, Embraer began a privatization process during {{the government of}} Itamar Franco. This {{was a period of}} privatization for many state-controlled companies in Brazil. Embraer was sold on December 7, 1994, which helped it avoid <b>a</b> <b>looming</b> bankruptcy. The company continued to win government contracts.|$|E

25|$|Until 1941 Riverside did {{not have}} a school {{cafeteria}} and lacked a full library. Riverside then received a renovation and a three-story addition that added a third gym and a full cafeteria {{to the rear of the}} building, turning the U shape of the school into a square on all but the fourth floor. The third gym was originally intended to be a new pool, but cost and <b>a</b> <b>looming</b> war made a new pool impractical.|$|E
25|$|Afterwards, Cao Cao {{returned}} to his base in the capital Xu City in the ninth lunar month to give his troops {{a few months of}} needed rest. Yuan Shao was able to regather his defeated armies to settle the rebellions in his own domain, soon reestablishing order and restored the status quo ante. In the fifth lunar month of the next year, summer 202, Yuan Shao died in illness and agony over his defeat, leaving his domain to be contested by his sons and <b>a</b> <b>looming</b> Cao Cao.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1970, Thompson {{wrote an}} article {{entitled}} The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved for the short-lived new journalism magazine Scanlan's Monthly. Although it was not widely read, the article {{was the first to}} use the techniques of Gonzo journalism, a style Thompson would later employ in almost every literary endeavor. The manic first-person subjectivity of the story was reportedly the result of sheer desperation; he was facing <b>a</b> <b>looming</b> deadline and started sending the magazine pages ripped out of his notebook. Ralph Steadman, who would collaborate with Thompson on several more projects, contributed expressionist pen-and-ink illustrations.|$|E

25|$|Discussions {{had begun}} about the {{projected}} {{need to build}} a larger arena for UT basketball team. Longhorn basketball had grown significantly in popularity under Gray and Gilstrap's guidance. Sellouts had not been particularly common during the war years, but the University was growing rapidly, and if Texas basketball continued to achieve success, <b>a</b> <b>looming</b> capacity problem was clearly foreseeable. Football and basketball were growing in popularity nationwide, and a spending and building boom was expected to take place in athletics departments around the country. No specific plans for basketball took shape at UT, but discussions of a larger gym or arena continued over the next three years.|$|E
25|$|Amidst {{the rising}} wave of {{lawlessness}} and the conveniently timed threat of <b>a</b> <b>looming</b> Communist insurgency, Marcos declared martial law on September 21, 1972 {{by virtue of}} Proclamation No. 1081. The Nacionalista president, ruling by decree, curtailed press freedom and other civil liberties, abolished Congress, closed down major media establishments, ordered the arrest of opposition leaders and militant activists, including his staunchest critics: senators Benigno Aquino, Jr., Jovito Salonga and Jose Diokno. The declaration of martial law was initially well received, given the social turmoil the Philippines was experiencing. Crime rates plunged dramatically after a curfew was implemented. Many political opponents were forced to go into exile. Corazon C. Aquino, the Wife of Benigno Aquino, Jr. replaced Marcos by an Election on 1986.|$|E
25|$|Most Democrats {{and some}} Republicans are {{critical}} of such ideas, {{partly because of the}} large (US$1 trillion or more) federal borrowing the plan would require, which might actually worsen the imbalance between revenues and expenses that Bush pointed to as <b>a</b> <b>looming</b> problem; and partly because of the problems encountered by the United Kingdom's privatized pension plan. See Social Security debate (United States). In addition, many Democrats opposed changes that they felt were turning Social Security into a welfare program that would be politically vulnerable. Portions of Bush's bill exempting private companies from social security payments have led to complaints that Bush's plan was created to benefit private companies, and that it would turn Social Security into just another insurance program.|$|E

25|$|During the {{campaign}} for the governorship in 2002, Romney proposed a plan that he said would balance the Massachusetts budget without raising taxes. He campaigned {{that he would be}} able to save $1 billion (out of a $23 billion budget) by reducing waste, fraud, and mismanagement in the state government, and he railed against the large tax increase that the legislature were negotiating in an attempt to close <b>a</b> <b>looming</b> $2 billion budget deficit. He promised that if elected he would repeal that tax increase within four years without cutting core government services. Surveys suggested that many residents agreed with his antitax stance. Though less than a majority, some 40percent of the voters voted in favor of abolishing the income tax in a referendum held during the election that carried Romney into office; and in an April 2003 poll of Massachusetts residents, 57percent said Romney should not consider raising taxes as part of his plan to balance the budget.|$|E
25|$|There were exceptions, of course. The {{first person}} known to {{publicly}} {{address this issue}} was Bob Bemer, who had noticed it in 1958 {{as a result of}} work on genealogical software. He spent the next twenty years trying to make programmers, IBM, the government of the United States and the ISO aware of the problem, with little result. This included the recommendation that the COBOL PICTURE clause should be used to specify four digit years for dates. Despite magazine articles on the subject from 1970 onward, the majority of programmers and managers only started recognising Y2K as <b>a</b> <b>looming</b> problem in the mid-1990s, but even then, inertia and complacency caused it to be mostly unresolved until the last few years of the decade. In 1989, Erik Naggum was instrumental in ensuring that internet mail used four digit representations of years by including a strong recommendation to this effect in the internet host requirements document RFC 1123.|$|E
25|$|Rosetti was {{a widower}} from September 1905, but enjoyed {{the moral and}} {{material}} support of his grown sons: Radu Jr was an officer and Henri a jurist, while Eugène had quit school and was prospecting for Standard Oil. He himself supplemented his income as an insurance investigator, assessing damages caused by hail. During this time, he became preoccupied with <b>a</b> <b>looming</b> social crisis. The first of his works to openly {{deal with the issue}} of agrarian inequalities and tensions over land was Despre originea și transformările clasei stăpânitoare din Moldova ("On the Origins and Transformations of the Moldavian Ruling Class"). His thesis looked back on the sources of Vlach law, suggesting that ancient Romanians were all free men organized into obști, that latifundia were imposed through boyar theft, and that serfdom was only cemented by the will of Michael the Brave in the late 16th century. Dealing more specifically with the genealogical claims of the Romanian nobles, Rosetti distinguished between an Uradel of knyazes and a later stratum of Phanariotes, with the latter including his own lineage.|$|E
