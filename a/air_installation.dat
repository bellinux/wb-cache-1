The last extensive project of decorations was planned for the celebrations commemorating the Third International in 1921 by the constructivists Alexander Vesnin and Liubov Popova. It was supposed to be large-scale open <b>air</b> <b>installation</b> consisting of a model of a “Fortress of Capitalism” and the “Communist Future City,” connected by ties and banners that were to be held up by airships. The envisioned site for this installation was the Khodinka field in northern Moscow.

However, Vesnin's and Popova's plans were not realized which is indicative of the underlying conflict between avant-garde aesthetics and Marxist ideology.|$|E
50|$|Camp Speicher, officially {{known as}} the Tikrit Air Academy and {{formerly}} as FOB Speicher, COB Speicher, and Al Sahra Airfield (under Saddam Hussein) is an <b>air</b> <b>installation</b> near Tikrit in northern Iraq. The installation is approximately 170 kilometers north of Baghdad and 11 kilometers west of the Tigris River. The United States Army captured the base from the Iraqi Army during the 2003 invasion of Iraq and used it during the Iraq War as {{the headquarters of the}} United States Division-North (USD-N, formerly Multinational Division, North, (MND-N)). The airfield is served by two main runways measuring 9600 ft long with a shorter runway measuring 7200 ft. The Americans named the airfield after Captain Michael Scott Speicher, a United States Navy pilot who was killed in action in Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War. Prior to the 2003 invasion, Al Sahra Airfield was the main base of the Iraqi Air Force Air Academy.|$|E
5000|$|Sanderson Field {{originally}} {{operated under}} the name Mason County Airport. and opened in the late 1920s. In 1941, the United States Navy took over operations of Mason County Airport {{for use as a}} Naval Air Station during World War II and became Naval Air Station Shelton. Under the ownership of the Navy, a new runway was added, and the facilities expanded. The airport closed down as a naval <b>air</b> <b>installation</b> in 1955 and sat unused for eleven years until reopening in August 1966. At the reopening dedication on August 28, it was deeded back to the Port of Shelton (who owns the airport today), christened [...] "Sanderson Field" [...] and the facilities improved. The largest of two runways (north-south; designated 17-35) was closed, and runway 5-23 (east-west) was expanded and kept open. The closed runway has occasionally been used as a drag strip. In late 1993, a chainlink security fence was added to the perimeter of the airport and in 1994 five new hangars were built at the southeast corner. A large number of buildings today are remnants of the World War II era.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, the privations of {{operating}} around Mubo {{and in the}} Markham Valley continued to take their toll on the Australians, and by early August {{the bulk of the}} men forward of Bulolu and Wau were commandos. The NGVR had been exhausted by their exertions during the fighting and few now remained, with a small group from the 2/5th Independent Company relieving the NGVR scouts for their observation role. Indeed, by September 1942 the NGVR was no longer recognisable as a unit. As the first phase of irregular warfare in the Salamaua-Lae-Wau region came to a close by the end of August, the Japanese occupied Mubo from where they were positioned to seize Wau and the Bulolo Valley, but had not yet moved up the Markham Valley in strength. The Australians were subsequently forced to abandon Wau and the Bulolo Valley, and were preparing to hold a position {{at the head of the}} Bulldog Track. While the focus of the campaign in New Guinea shifted to the Milne Bay and Kokoda Track battles in August and September 1942 the NGVR continued to man its posts overlooking the Japanese base areas, patrolling extensively. The Allies remained concerned about the defence of the important <b>air</b> <b>installation</b> at Wau and were keen to secure the crest of the Owen Stanleys in that area.

The results in this paper demonstrate that study focus on the tertiary <b>air</b> <b>installation</b> is a practical measure without the analysis of other processes in the rotary kiln. A solution to this problem offers several alternatives of modifying the inlet to the tertiary air duct. As a result of numerical calculations, we demonstrate the influence of geometry of a rotary kiln modification on the number of large particles transported in the tertiary air duct. The results indicate that in order to reduce large particles, rotary kiln head geometry needs to be modified, and a particle settler should be installed at its outlet...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{technological}} challenges for the transport sector is to cut emissions of particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) simultaneously from diesel vehicles to meet future emission standards and to reduce their contribution to the pollution of ambient <b>air.</b> <b>Installation</b> of particle filters in all existing diesel vehicles (for new vehicles, the feasibility is proven) is an efficient but expensive and complicated solution; thus other short-term alternatives have been proposed. It {{is well known that}} water/diesel (W/ D) emulsions with up to 20 % water can reduce PM and NOx emissions in heavy-duty (HD) engines. The amount of water {{that can be used in}} emulsions for the technically more susceptible light-duty (LD) vehicles is much lower, due to risks of impairing engine performance and durability. The present study investigates the potential emission reductions of an experimental 6 % W/D emulsion with EURO- 3 LD diesel vehicles in comparison to a commercial 12 % W/D emulsion with a EURO- 3 HD engine and to a Ceriumbased combustion improver additive. For PM, the emulsions reduced the emissions with - 32 % for LD vehicles (mass/km) and - 59 % for the HD engine (mass/ kWh). However, NOx emissions remained unchanged, and emissions of other pollutants were actually increased for the LD vehicles with + 26 % for hydrocarbons (HC), + 18 % for CO, and + 25 % for PM-associated benzo[a]pyrene toxicity equivalents (TEQ). In contrast, CO (- 32 %), TEQ (- 14 %), and NOx (- 6 %) were reduced by the emulsion for the HD engine, and only hydrocarbons were slightly increased (+ 16 %). Whereas the Cerium-based additive was inefficient in the HD engine for all emissions except for TEQ (- 39 %), it markedly reduced all emissions for the LD vehicles (PM - 13 %, CO - 18 %, HC - 26 %, TEQ - 25 %) except for NOx, which remained unchanged. The presented data indicate a strong potential for reductions in PM emissions from current diesel engines by optimizing the fuel composition. JRC. H. 4 -Transport and air qualit...|$|E
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that on average people spend more than 90 {{percent of their time}} indoors. And yet, when we think about our health and how the environment affects it, most are unaware that indoor environments may have a larger impact on our health and well-being than even the outdoor environment. Given the amount of time we spend indoors, what are we exposed to indoors? Can we design indoor environments that are not only not harmful to us, but actually good for us? And can we do this in an energy efficient manner? What does a “healthy building” look like? To start answering these questions, we focused on studying how various building characteristics and interventions affected indoor air microbiology and energy efficiency, two qualities that are critical when designing a healthy building. This work is split into three parts: (1) Investigating a healthy building intervention: cooling coil ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVG-CC), (2) investigating the microbiology of indoor air quality in a university dormitory and its effect on student health, and (3) a review of the role of mechanical ventilation in the airborne transmission of infectious agents in buildings. Part (1) (Chapter 2) investigates the effect of ultraviolet germicidal coil cleaning (UVG-CC) technology on building energy efficiency and indoor air microbiology. Cooling coil surfaces within building ventilation systems are ideal sites for biofilm formation due to the presence of adequate nutrients (i. e. deposited particles) and moisture (i. e. condensate). Biofouling of cooling coils can contribute to decreased heat transfer efficiency and possible contamination of indoor air by releasing toxins or allergens into the air entering the building. We found that, in mild condensing conditions, UVG-CC increased heat transfer effectiveness by 3 – 6. 4 %, with an uncertainty of ± 2. 7 % resulting from the accuracy of our instrumentation. Microbial results showed increased airborne cell counts downstream of the coil one month after UVG-CC installation. This increase coincided with drastic (80 – 90 %) decreases in surface cell counts, which suggests that UVGI inactivated biofilms {{from the surface of the}} coil and these clusters were then re-entrained into the airstream. Overall this study suggests that UVG-CC is most effective at reducing microbial contamination and increasing heat transfer effectiveness in humid climates with high latent loads but care must be taken one month after installation, especially in the case of retrofits, as inactive biological material may re-entrain into the <b>air.</b> <b>Installation</b> of this technology should be carefully considered depending on the climatic region, and may not need to be operated during non-condensing states. Future studies of UVG-CC should pay careful attention to the sensitivity and detection limits of their instrumentation, and would benefit from studying environments prone to excessive biological fouling so that differences between UV and non-UV coils are more pronounced. Part (2) (Chapter 3) of this dissertation investigates the microbiota in indoor air in a student dormitory. We have long known that human occupants are a major source of microbes in the built environment. What remains undetermined is what, if anything, we can learn about the occupants of a building by analyzing the microbial communities found in indoor air. We investigated bacterial and fungal diversity found in settled dust samples and dust collected onto HVAC air filters from 91 rooms within a university dormitory in Boulder, CO. The sex of the room occupants had the most significant effect on the bacterial communities found in both the settled dust and air filter samples, while the room occupants had no significant effect on fungal communities. By examining the abundances of taxa at the genus level, we can predict the sex of room occupants with 79 % accuracy, a finding that demonstrates the potential forensic applications of studying indoor air microbiology. We also identified which taxa at the OTU level were most different in abundance and frequency of occurrence between female and male rooms, and found that taxa often identified as members of the vaginal microbiome were more common in female-occupied rooms while taxa associated with human skin or the male urogenital microbiota were more common in male-occupied rooms. Measurement methods used to characterize the dormitory HVAC system and methods of health data collection are also described. Part (3) (Chapter 4) is a comprehensive literature review of the role of mechanical ventilation in the transmission of infectious agents in buildings. Infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics such as those due to SARS, influenza, measles, or tuberculosis have raised concern about the airborne transmission of pathogens in indoor environments. There are insufficient data to quantify how various parameters controlled by HVAC systems may affect the airborne transmission of infectious agents. To improve our understanding and design of HVAC systems to promote better infection control, our review reveals a strong need for more epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses. Specifically, we call for well designed prospective observational or intervention studies in buildings to establish causal relationships between airborne exposures and outcomes and between building factors and exposures. Future studies will benefit greatly from improved experimental design, standardized measurement methods, and better collaboration between epidemiologists and HVAC engineers. The work presented here provides a glimpse into the complex and interdisciplinary nature of indoor air and building science and makes connections across building energy systems, HVAC science, and microbiology to demonstrate the nuances of how building characteristics or design decisions can affect indoor exposures...|$|E
