5|$|Although the {{physical}} and chemical properties of cobalt <b>and</b> <b>nickel</b> are rather similar, the concentrations of isolated cobalt in diamond are much smaller than those of nickel (parts per billion range). Several defects related to isolated cobalt have been detected by electron paramagnetic resonance and photoluminescence, but their structure is yet unknown.|$|E
5|$|Chromium {{content of}} common foods is {{generally}} low (1-13 micrograms per serving). Chromium content of food varies widely due {{to differences in}} soil mineral content, growing season, plant cultivar, and contamination during processing. In addition, large amounts of chromium (<b>and</b> <b>nickel)</b> leach into food cooked in stainless steel.|$|E
5|$|Chromium, unlike such metals as iron <b>and</b> <b>nickel,</b> {{does not}} suffer from {{hydrogen}} embrittlement. However, it does suffer from nitrogen embrittlement, reacting with nitrogen from air and forming brittle nitrides {{at the high}} temperatures necessary to work the metal parts.|$|E

5|$|Iron is {{the first}} of the {{transition}} metals that cannot reach its group oxidation state of +8, although its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium can, with ruthenium having more difficulty than osmium. Ruthenium exhibits an aqueous cationic chemistry in its low oxidation states similar to that of iron, but osmium does not, favoring high oxidation states in which it forms anionic complexes. In fact, in this second half of the 3d transition series, vertical similarities down the groups compete with the horizontal similarities of iron with its neighbors cobalt <b>and</b> <b>nickel</b> in the periodic table, which are also ferromagnetic at room temperature and share similar chemistry. As such, iron, cobalt, <b>and</b> <b>nickel</b> are sometimes grouped together as the iron triad.|$|E
5|$|Three of {{the most}} {{commonly}} used crystal lattice structures in metals are the body-centred cubic, face-centred cubic and close-packed hexagonal. Ferritic steel has a body-centred cubic structure and austenitic steel, non-ferrous metals like aluminum, copper <b>and</b> <b>nickel</b> have the face-centred cubic structure.|$|E
5|$|Today, some cobalt is {{produced}} specifically from various metallic-lustered ores, for example cobaltite (CoAsS), {{but the main}} source of the element is as a by-product of copper <b>and</b> <b>nickel</b> mining. The copper belt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic and Zambia yields most of the cobalt mined worldwide.|$|E

25|$|In {{anticipation}} {{of the business of}} melting down U.S. pennies <b>and</b> U.S. <b>nickels</b> for profit, the U.S. Mint, which {{is a part of the}} US Department of the Treasury, implemented new regulations on December 14, 2006, which criminalize the melting of pennies <b>and</b> <b>nickels</b> <b>and</b> place limits on export of the coins. Violators can be punished with a fine of up to $10,000 USD and/or imprisoned for a maximum of five years.|$|R
5|$|Traditionally, most sulfide ores {{have been}} {{processed}} using pyrometallurgical techniques {{to produce a}} matte for further refining. Recent advances in hydrometallurgical techniques resulted in significantly purer metallic nickel product. Most sulfide deposits have traditionally been processed by concentration through a froth flotation process followed by pyrometallurgical extraction. In hydrometallurgical processes, nickel sulfide ores are concentrated with flotation (differential flotation if Ni/Fe ratio is too low) and then smelted. The nickel matte is further processed with the Sherritt-Gordon process. First, copper is removed by adding hydrogen sulfide, leaving a concentrate of cobalt <b>and</b> <b>nickel.</b> Then, solvent extraction is used to separate the cobalt <b>and</b> <b>nickel,</b> with the final nickel content greater than 99%.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt in {{compound}} form {{occurs as}} a minor component of copper <b>and</b> <b>nickel</b> minerals. It is the major metallic component in combination with sulfur and arsenic in the sulfidic cobaltite (CoAsS), safflorite (CoAs2), glaucodot ((Co,Fe)AsS), and skutterudite (CoAs3) minerals. The mineral cattierite is similar to pyrite and occurs together with vaesite in the copper deposits of the Katanga Province. Upon contact with the atmosphere, weathering occurs and the sulfide minerals oxidize to form pink erythrite ("cobalt glance": Co3(AsO4)2·8H2O) and spherocobaltite (CoCO3).|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that the vulcanoids would be very rich in {{elements}} with a high melting point, such as iron <b>and</b> <b>nickel.</b> They are unlikely to possess a regolith because such fragmented material heats and cools more rapidly, and is affected more strongly by the Yarkovsky effect, than solid rock. Vulcanoids are probably similar to Mercury in colour and albedo, and may contain material {{left over from the}} earliest stages of the Solar System's formation.|$|E

5|$|On {{geophysical}} evidence, {{most of the}} nickel on Earth {{is believed}} to be in the Earth's outer and inner cores. Kamacite and taenite are naturally occurring alloys of iron <b>and</b> <b>nickel.</b> For kamacite, the alloy is usually in the proportion of 90:10 to 95:5, although impurities (such as cobalt or carbon) may be present, while for taenite the nickel content is between 20% and 65%. Kamacite and taenite are also found in nickel iron meteorites.|$|E
5|$|Other {{heavy metals}} noted for their {{potentially}} hazardous nature, usually as toxic environmental pollutants, include manganese (central nervous system damage); cobalt <b>and</b> <b>nickel</b> (carcinogens); copper, zinc, selenium and silver (endocrine disruption, congenital disorders, or general toxic effects in fish, plants, birds, or other aquatic organisms); tin, as organotin (central nervous system damage); antimony (a suspected carcinogen); and thallium (central nervous system damage).|$|E
5|$|Renewed {{interest}} in copper <b>and</b> <b>nickel</b> mining in northern Minnesota {{has also been}} a source of tension. While the mines would be situated south and west of the BWCAW, concerns about runoff that could ultimately enter the BWCAW's watershed have caused concerns among environmental and conservationist groups. A 2015 bill proposed by Representative Betty McCollum seeks to block nearby mining.|$|E

50|$|Rising copper prices {{caused the}} {{reduction}} {{of the size of the}} large cent. Originally, cent coins were large and heavy. This changed between 1856 and 1857 when they were replaced by the small-sized Flying Eagle cent, which was made of 88% copper <b>and</b> 12% <b>nickel,</b> <b>and</b> had a somewhat pale brown color. In 1859 this was replaced by the Indian Head cent, and by 1864, the Civil War increased <b>nickel</b> <b>and</b> copper prices and the cent was made thinner <b>and</b> the <b>nickel</b> removed; the cent was thus now a small, thin bronze coin.|$|R

5|$|The Soviet period saw a rapid {{increase}} of the population, although most of it remained confined to urbanized territories along the sea coast and the railroads. The Sami people were subject to forced collectivization, including forced relocation to Lovozero and other centralized settlements, and overall the peninsula was heavily industrialized and militarized, largely due to its strategic position and {{the discovery of the}} vast apatite deposits in the 1920s. As a result, the ecology of the peninsula suffered major ecological damage, including contamination by military nuclear waste <b>and</b> <b>nickel</b> smelting.|$|E
5|$|Welded {{titanium}} {{pipe and}} process equipment (heat exchangers, tanks, process vessels, valves) {{are used in}} the chemical and petrochemical industries primarily for corrosion resistance. Specific alloys are used in Oil & Gas downhole applications <b>and</b> <b>nickel</b> hydrometallurgy for their high strength (e. g.: titanium Beta C alloy), corrosion resistance, or both. The pulp and paper industry uses titanium in process equipment exposed to corrosive media, such as sodium hypochlorite or wet chlorine gas (in the bleachery). Other applications include ultrasonic welding, wave soldering, and sputtering targets.|$|E
5|$|Beads {{made from}} {{meteoric}} iron in 3500BC or earlier {{were found in}} Gerzah, Egypt by G. A. Wainwright. The beads contain 7.5% nickel, which is a signature of meteoric origin since iron found in the Earth's crust generally has only minuscule nickel impurities. Meteoric iron was highly regarded due to its origin in the heavens and was often used to forge weapons and tools. For example, a dagger made of meteoric iron {{was found in the}} tomb of Tutankhamun, containing similar proportions of iron, cobalt, <b>and</b> <b>nickel</b> to a meteorite discovered in the area, deposited by an ancient meteor shower. Items that were likely made of iron by Egyptians date from 3000 to 2500BC. Meteoritic iron is comparably soft and ductile and easily forged by cold working but may get brittle when heated because of the nickel content.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to evaluate the gastroprotective activity of Schiff base ligand derived from the condensation reaction of tryptamine (an indole derivative) and 5 -nitrosalicylaldehyde (TNS) <b>and</b> its <b>nickel</b> (II) complex against ethanol-induced gastric ulcer in rats. The compounds were orally administered with low (30 mg/kg) and high (60 mg/kg) doses to ulcer-induced Sprague-Dawley rats. Macroscopically, the ulcer control group exhibited severe mucosal injury, whereas pre-treatment with either cimetidine or TNS <b>and</b> its <b>nickel</b> (II) complex each resulted in significant protection against gastric mucosal injury. Flattening of gastric mucosal folds was also observed in rats pretreated with TNS <b>and</b> its <b>nickel</b> complex. Histological studies of the gastric wall of ulcer control group revealed severe damage of gastric mucosa, along with edema and leucocytes infiltration of the submucosal layer compared to rats pre-treated with either cimetidine or TNS <b>and</b> its <b>nickel</b> (II) compound, where there was marked gastric protection along with reduction of edema and leucocytes infiltration of the submucosal layer. Acute toxicity study done on mice with a higher dose of 5 g/kg of TNS <b>and</b> its <b>nickel</b> (II) complex did not manifest any toxicological signs. Research finding suggest that TNS <b>and</b> its <b>nickel</b> (II) complex could be considered as effective gastroprotective compounds. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland...|$|R
