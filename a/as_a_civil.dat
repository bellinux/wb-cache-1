5|$|Burebista inevitably {{came into}} {{conflict}} with Rome. During the Roman civil war of 49–44 BC, Pompey gained the support of Burebista through Akornion of Dionysopolis. Pompey himself had recognized Burebista's and Dacia's might with their successful conquests against the Greek Black Sea cities. Caesar, however, ended any alliance between Pompey and Burebista at the Battle of Pharsalus. Caesar was also aware of the growing strength of the Dacians and had himself planned to lead an attack against Burebista. Burebista at this time had a force that may have numbered up to 200,000 men – though it is disputed whether this force was an actual military force {{or the number of}} able bodied men within the kingdom. Regardless, Dacia was a formidable power which Caesar perceived as a threat to Rome. But Caesar was never able to start his intended campaign because he was assassinated in 44 BC. Burebista met with the same fate <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> uprising had him killed in either 45 or 44 BC.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale used Mitică as a stock {{character}} to feature in satirical contexts; the biographical insights he provided are short and often contradict each other.

His existence is connected to events in the history of Bucharest which he occasionally references in his jokes. Like Lache and Mache, who are present in Caragiale's fiction, the character is usually portrayed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> servant who has a hard time making ends meet, but who is well liked by his peers.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{declaration}} of the German republic in 1918 and the ensuing revolutionary period, the so-called Weimar Republic was founded in August 1919. To form a continuity between the anti-autocratic movement of the 19th century and the new democratic republic, the old black-red-gold tricolour was designated as the national German flag in the Weimar Constitution in 1919. Only the tiny German principalities of Reuss-Greiz, Reuss-Gera, and Waldeck-Pyrmont and its republican successor had upheld the tradition and had always continued to use the German colours of black, red, and or (gold) in their flag. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>civil</b> ensign, the black-white-red tricolour was retained, albeit with the new tricolour in the top left corner.|$|E
