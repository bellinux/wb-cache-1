5|$|The {{character}} art {{featured on}} the game's box art and instruction manual is {{in the style of}} a comic book, and the characters <b>are</b> <b>portrayed</b> as toy dolls that come to life to fight.

5|$|In Vedic literature, Mitra and Varuna <b>are</b> <b>portrayed</b> as {{icons of}} affection and {{intimate}} friendship between males (the Sanskrit word mitra means “friend” or “companion”). They are depicted riding a shark or crocodile together while bearing tridents, ropes, conch shells and water pots. Sometimes they <b>are</b> <b>portrayed</b> seated side-by-side on a golden chariot drawn by seven swans. Ancient Brahmana texts furthermore associate Mitra and Varuna {{with the two}} lunar phases and same-sex relations: “Mitra and Varuna, on the other hand, are the two half-moons: the waxing one is Varuna and the waning one is Mitra. During the new-moon night these two meet {{and when they are}} thus together they are pleased with a cake offering. Verily, all are pleased and all is obtained by any person knowing this. On that same night, Mitra implants his seed in Varuna and when the moon later wanes, that waning is produced from his seed.” (Shatapatha Brahmana 2.4.4.19) Varuna is similarly said to implant his seed in Mitra on the full-moon night for the purpose of securing its future waxing. In Hinduism, the new- and full-moon nights are discouraged times for procreation and consequently often associated with citrarata or unusual types of intercourse.|$|E

5|$|Much like {{fathers are}} {{depicted}} primarily in recreational activities with their children, other male {{members of the}} family, including sons and male grandchildren, <b>are</b> <b>portrayed</b> in play activities {{the majority of the}} time. Interestingly, young female members of the family are depicted similarly in play activities, but nevertheless tend to be more likely shown in activities related to chores and child-care. In addition, the image of the grandparent has been largely nonexistent in advertising.|$|E

5|$|The {{representation}} of gangsters {{in the literature}} (Drum magazine) went through very different stages during the 1950s and early 1960s. The first representation is characterized by consistent condemnations of crime as an urban phenomenon that threatens the rural identity of tribal blacks. The second is almost a complete turn-around from the first, as gangsters <b>are</b> <b>portrayed</b> as urban survivors {{who are able to}} achieve a standard of living normally denied to blacks. The final period is an extended period of nostalgia for the shebeen culture that all but disappeared with the destruction of Sophiatown.|$|E
5|$|The statue {{that sits}} atop the Burnside Fountain is now {{commonly}} referred to as Turtle Boy. In the tradition of the Manneken Pis in Brussels, Turtle Boy has become an unofficial mascot for Worcester. Much of the local popularity of the statue is due to bawdy insinuations about how the boy and the turtle <b>are</b> <b>portrayed.</b> Anonymous members of the Worcester community sometimes dress the statue in festive clothes for holidays, local bands write crowd-pleasing songs about it, and the statue has even graced postcards of the city.|$|E

50|$|Three {{different}} {{actors have}} played Tommasino {{in the three}} feature films. In The Godfather, as a middle-aged man, he <b>was</b> <b>portrayed</b> by Corrado Gaipa. Tommasino <b>was</b> <b>portrayed</b> as partially paralyzed because Gaipa was a wheelchair user in real life. In The Godfather Part II, a much younger Tommasino <b>was</b> <b>portrayed</b> by Mario Cotone. In The Godfather Part III, as an elderly man, he <b>was</b> <b>portrayed</b> by Vittorio Duse.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1975 film, The Hindenburg, Pruss <b>was</b> <b>portrayed</b> by Charles Durning. This {{portrayal}} is inaccurate because Pruss <b>is</b> <b>portrayed</b> as {{ignoring the}} advice of the 2nd Captain Ernst Lehmann, who only traveled as an observer, saying [...] "I'll do the worrying on this trip". In the docudrama Hindenburg: The Untold Story he <b>was</b> <b>portrayed</b> by Albert Welling. In the 2011 RTL television movie he <b>is</b> <b>portrayed</b> by Jürgen Schornagel.|$|R
5|$|Wisemore's {{character}} introduces {{feelings about}} the London community and criticises various problems. However, his reflections <b>are</b> <b>portrayed</b> as both correct and lacking, {{and that he is}} focused only on the bad aspects of life. His ideas result from removing himself from society in preference to the company of classical books. Although he does not realise it, the play suggests that there are virtuous people. Merital, in response to Wisemore, believes that Wisemore's philosophical inclinations are foolish. As the play later reveals, Wisemore's views are only a mask to hide from his own feelings and views on love.|$|E

The events feature wrestlers from the promotion's roster competing in a variety of professional wrestling match types, performances with pre-determined outcomes between wrestlers with fictional personalities that <b>are</b> <b>portrayed</b> as real for the entertainment of the audience. The WrestleMania franchise debuted in 1985 with WrestleMania I, and has been produced annually since then. WrestleMania 33 is the most recent production.|$|E
5|$|A common {{plot device}} is referenced, where a {{shoulder}} angel (represents conscience) and a shoulder devil (representing temptation) appear near a character. This concept is spoofed in the episode, {{as both the}} devil and the angel suggest to Mackey that he should drink the beer. When Stan tells Kyle what he thinks a bris means, a dolly zoom is used, which is an unsettling filmmaking effect often used {{to show that a}} character is undergoing a major realization. The hallucinogenic effects of certain drugs <b>are</b> <b>portrayed</b> by different means. When inhaling cannabis, the alley that Mr. Mackey is in suddenly turns very colorful. After taking LSD, Mackey's head inflates like a giant balloon, and then literally detaches from his body, and floats away (the boys interact with Mackey by looking up at his head as it floats over them).|$|E
