50|$|The {{traveling}} wave on a Leaky-Wave Antenna is a fast wave, with a phase velocity {{greater than the}} speed of light.This type of wave radiates continuously along its length, and hence the propagation wavenumber kz is complex, consisting of both a phase and an <b>attenuation</b> <b>constant.</b> Highly directive beams at an arbitrary specified angle can be achieved with this type of antenna, with a low sidelobe level. The phase constant β of the wave controls the beam angle (and this can be varied changing the frequency), while the <b>attenuation</b> <b>constant</b> α controls the beamwidth.

40|$|In this paper, {{radiation}} at broadside is {{studied for}} a general class of leaky-wave antennas (LWAs) comprised of a grounded slab covered with a partially reflecting surface, {{on the basis of}} a simple transverse equivalent network model of the structure. The analysis of the one-dimensional (1 -D) version of such a LWA excited by a line source shows that a central role in establishing the features of broadside radiation is played by the condition that the phase and <b>attenuation</b> <b>constants</b> of the leaky mode responsible for radiation are equal. When this happens, a beam with a single peak at broadside is on the verge of splitting into two distinct peaks, and maximum power density is radiated at broadside. Design formulas to achieve such an optimized condition, as well as approximate expressions for the frequency bandwidth and pattern beamwidth of the antenna and for the leaky-wave phase and <b>attenuation</b> <b>constants</b> are derived, both in the absence and in the presence of losses; in addition, an optimal-beamwidth condition (which gives the narrowest broadside beam) is derived.

5000|$|Note that [...] is {{identical}} to the skin depth, the latter term usually applying to metals in reference to the decay of electrical currents (which follow the decay in the electric or magnetic field due to a plane wave incident on a bulk conductor). The <b>attenuation</b> <b>constant</b> [...] is also identical to the (negative) real part of the propagation constant, which may also be referred to as [...] using a notation inconsistent with the above use. When referencing a source one must always be careful to note whether a number such as [...] or [...] refers to the decay of the field itself, or of the intensity (power) associated with that field. It can also be ambiguous as to whether a positive number describes attenuation (reduction of the field) or gain; this is usually obvious from the context.|$|E
5000|$|Since leakage occurs {{over the}} length of the slit in the waveguiding structure, the whole length {{constitutes}} the antenna's effective aperture unless the leakage rate is so great that the power has effectively leaked away before reaching the end of the slit.A large <b>attenuation</b> <b>constant</b> implies a short effective aperture, so that the radiated beam has a large beamwidth. Conversely, a low value of α results in a long effective aperture and a narrow beam, provided the physical aperture is sufficiently long.Since power is radiated continuously along the length, the aperture field of a leaky-wave antenna with strictly-uniform geometry has an exponential decay (usually slow), so that the sidelobe behavior is poor. The presence of the sidelobes is essentially because the structure is finite along z.When we change the cross-sectional geometry of the guiding structure to modify the value of α at some point z, however, {{it is likely that the}} value of β at that point is also modified slightly. However, since β must not be changed, the geometry must be further altered to restore the value of β, thereby changing α somewhat as well.In practice, this difficulty may require a two-step process. The practice is then to vary the value of α slowly along the length in a specified way while maintaining β constant (that is the angle of maximum radiation), so as to adjust the amplitude of the aperture distribution A(z) to yield the desired sidelobe performance.We can divide uniform leaky-wave antennas into air-filled ones and partially dielectric-filled ones. In the first case, since the transverse wavenumber kt is then a constant with frequency, the beamwidth of the radiation remains exactly constantas the beam is scanned by varying the frequency. In fact, since: ...|$|E
