50|$|The chub {{mackerel}}, Pacific mackerel, or Pacific {{chub mackerel}} (Scomber japonicus) is a mackerel which closely resembles the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomber colias) is a pelagic {{schooling}} {{species of}} mackerel {{found in the}} Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Black Sea. It was originally {{thought to be a}} subspecies of the chub mackerel Scomber japonicus colias.|$|E
5000|$|About 21 {{species in}} the family Scombridae are {{commonly}} called mackerel. The type species for the scombroid mackerel is the Atlantic mackerel, Scomber scombrus. Until recently, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> and Indo-Pacific chub mackerel {{were thought to be}} subspecies of the same species. In 1999, Collette established, on molecular and morphological considerations, that these are separate species. Mackerel are smaller with shorter lifecycles than their close relatives, the tuna, which are also members of the same family.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chub</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Scomber japonicus, are {{the most}} intensively fished scombroid mackerel. As {{can be seen from}} the graph on the right, they account for about half the total capture {{production}} of scombroid mackerels. As a species they are easily confused with <b>Atlantic</b> <b>mackerel.</b> <b>Chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> migrate long distances in oceans and across the Mediterranean. They can be caught with drift nets and suitable trawls, but are most usually caught with surround nets at night by attracting them with lampara lamps.|$|R
5000|$|Fishing {{boats are}} {{generally}} small, often {{little more than}} 30 m but up to 100 m for a large tuna or whaling ship. Aboard a fish processing vessel, the catch can be made ready for market and sold more quickly once the ship makes port. Special purpose vessels have special gear. For example, trawlers have winches and arms, stern-trawlers have a rear ramp, and tuna seiners have skiffs. In 2004, 85800000 t of fish {{were caught in the}} marine capture fishery. Anchoveta represented the largest single catch at 10700000 t. [...] That year, the top ten marine capture species also included Alaska pollock, Blue whiting, Skipjack tuna, <b>Atlantic</b> herring, <b>Chub</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Japanese anchovy, Chilean jack mackerel, Largehead hairtail, and Yellowfin tuna. [...] Other species including salmon, shrimp, lobster, clams, squid and crab, are also commercially fished. Modern commercial fishermen use many methods. One is fishing by nets, such as purse seine, beach seine, lift nets, gillnets, or entangling nets. Another is trawling, including bottom trawl. Hooks and lines are used in methods like long-line fishing and hand-line fishing. Another method is the use of fishing trap.|$|R
50|$|As larvae, <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> feed {{mainly on}} copepods and rotifers and {{sometimes}} even smaller larvae of their own kind. <b>Chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> larvae can consume up to 87% of their dry body weight a day. As juveniles, <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> feed mainly on zooplankton. As adults, they feed on mysids and euphausids.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> is a long, {{streamlined}} {{fish with}} a deeply forked tail. The first dorsal fin has 9 or 10 spines and {{is separated from}} the second dorsal fin by a space at least as long as its base. The origin of the anal fin is directly below or just behind {{the origin of the}} second dorsal fin. This fish is silvery in colour, the upper surface has oblique zigzagging lines while the belly is paler and spotted or marked with wavy lines.|$|E
50|$|Chub {{mackerel}} are {{widespread in}} the Indo-Pacific. They are absent from the Indian Ocean except for South Africa from KwaZulu-Natal to Western Cape, and are replaced by the closely related <b>Atlantic</b> <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> in the Atlantic. The chub mackerel is widely distributed, usually found in the northwestern, southeastern, and northeastern Pacific. In the eastern Pacific, {{it can be found}} from central Mexico to southeastern Alaska. Chub mackerel are generally found within 20 miles (37 km) off the coast in waters between 50 and 72°F (10 to 22°C). Young mackerel live around sandy beaches or kelp beds, while adults are found in deeper waters in shallow banks to 1000 feet (300 m) deep. Chub mackerel school with other pelagic species, as well such as other types of mackerels and sardines. In 2015 chub mackerels were found in Indian Ocean and the new species were classified as Scomber indicus.|$|E
40|$|Small pelagic fishes are {{particularly}} abundant {{in areas with}} high environmental variability (zones of coastal upwelling and areas of tidal mixing and river discharge), and because of this, their abundance suffers large inter-annual and inter-decadal fluctuations. In Portugal, the most important species in terms of landings are European sardine, Atlantic horse mackerel and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel.</b> Small pelagic fish landings account for 62. 8 % of the total fish biomass and represent 32. 7 % of the economical value of all catches. We have investigated trends in landings of these small pelagic fishes and detected the effects of environmental factors in this fishery. In order to explain the variability of landings of small pelagic fishes, we have used official landings (1965 - 2012) for trawling and purse seine fisheries and applied generalized linear models, using the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO) (annual and winter NAO index), sea surface temperature (SST), wind data (strength and North-South and East-West wind components) and rainfall, as explanatory variables. Regression {{analysis was used to}} describe the relationship between landings and SST. The models explained between 50. 16 and 51. 07 % of the variability of the LPUE, with the most important factors being winter NAO index, SST and wind strength. The LPUE of European sardine and Atlantic horse mackerel was negatively correlated with SST, and LPUE of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> was positively correlated with SST. The use of landings of three important species of small pelagic fishes allowed the detection of variations in landings associated with changes in sea water temperature and NAO index...|$|E
50|$|Known to {{fisherman}} as the hardhead, the <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> {{is regularly}} fished and canned for human consumption, pet food, bait, or served fresh. From 1980-89, the recreational catch average in California was 1,462 tons. Since {{they have begun}} being fished, the <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> reached its catching peak in 1978 with 3,412,602 tons. Since 1978, the catch ratings have continued to decrease, but picked back up a little in 1995. The ideal method for catching <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> is round-haul gear such as purse seines. Bycatch is low because nets are placed directly on schools of fish. <b>Chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> are caught all year round, but especially between June and November. They can be caught {{on both sides of}} North America, but the most important fisheries commercially are in California and Mexico.|$|R

40|$|The {{metazoan}} parasite {{assemblage of}} the head of 30 specimens of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomber colias) from the western Mediterranean Sea was analysed. Eight species of parasites were found, four mazocraeid monogeneans: Grubea cochlear (prevalence = 10 %), Kuhnia scombercolias (59 %), K. scombri (52 %), Pseudokuhnia minor (86 %); three didymozoid trematodes: Nematobothrium cf. faciale (21 %), N. filiforme (41 %), N. scombri (7 %); and one laerneopodid copepod: Clavelissa scombri (7 %). Results were compared with previously published data from 14 localities of the eastern Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, using non-parametric univariate and multivariate analyses, and the whole parasite fauna of S. colias was compared with that of the congeners (S. australasicus, S. japonicus and S. scombrus). Parasites showed to reflect the biogeographical and phylogenetic history of host. From a methodological point of view, the use of both non-parametric univariate and multivariate techniques proved to be effective tools to detect dissimilarities between parasite assemblages...|$|E
40|$|Restriction-site {{associated}} DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) {{and related}} methods are revolutionizing {{the field of}} population genomics in non-model organisms as they allow generating an unprecedented number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) even when no genomic information is available. Yet, RAD-seq data analyses rely on assumptions on nature and number of nucleotide variants present in a single locus, the choice of which may lead to an under- or overestimated number of SNPs and/or to incorrectly called genotypes. Using the Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus L.) and a close relative, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomber colias), as case study, here we explore the sensitivity of population structure inferences to two crucial aspects in RAD-seq data analysis: {{the maximum number of}} mismatches allowed to merge reads into a locus and the relatedness of the individuals used for genotype calling and SNP selection. Our study resolves the population structure of the Atlantic mackerel, but, most importantly, provides insights into the effects of alternative RAD-seq data analysis strategies on population structure inferences that are directly applicable to other species...|$|E
40|$|Small {{pelagic fish}} are {{the link between}} planktonic {{production}} and higher trophic levels. Competition for resources {{may play a role}} in the population dynamics of species, some of them probably standing out from the others due to greater feeding success. It is therefore important to understand the trophic niche of species overlapping both spatially and temporally. In this study, we have investigated the diet, prey preference, trophic niche breadth and diet overlap of the 8 major small pelagic species (anchovy, sardine, sprat, Atlantic and Mediterranean horse mackerel, bogue, Atlantic mackerel and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel)</b> inhabiting the Bay of Biscay. Results indicate that all fish feed mainly on calanoid copepods, incorporating larger prey like euphausiids and decapods to complete their diet. Differences in ingested prey diversity seem to be more limited by the available zooplankton at sea than by a specific diet preference by fish species, resulting in an overall high diet overlap, especially within clupeids but also between clupeids and other (larger) predator species. Consumption estimations for different prey groups could therefore determine whether such a large diet overlap between small pelagic fish, together with spatial co-occurrence, results in competition or enhances the effects of intraguild predation, which is important in terms of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> {{is not a}} predator, so {{it relies}} on camouflaging itself to stay hidden from its predators. Although it cannot change colors or spray ink like other marine species, it has a dorsal pattern {{very similar to the}} light pattern that the waves and sun work {{together}} to emit. When in danger, they move close {{to the surface of the}} water to merge with the flickering light of the sun. From above, spotting the <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> is difficult, which helps keep it safe from predatory birds. Camouflage and Evasive Behaviour. [...] This is the technique <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> use to stay hidden from their predators, such as sharks, birds, and mainly tuna.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> has a {{well-developed}} {{swim bladder}} attached with the esophagus, which the [...] "true mackerels" [...] in the Scomber genus lack, and a characteristic color difference is seen between the <b>chub</b> and the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>chub,</b> {{the latter being}} silvery-sided below the midline, whereas {{the lower part of}} the sides of the chub (otherwise colored somewhat like the Atlantic) are mottled with small dusky blotches, and the chub has a larger eye than the Atlantic. Less obvious differences are that the dorsal fins are closer together in the chub and only 9 or 10 spines are in its first dorsal fin instead of 11 or more, which is the usual count in the Atlantic mackerel. In most species, the mackerel is known to travel in large schools. It is a smaller fish than its better-known relatives, growing to a length around 8 to 14 in.|$|R

40|$|Small {{pelagic fish}} {{can play an}} {{important}} role in various ecosystems linking lower and upper trophic levels. Among the factor behind the observed inter-annual variations in small pelagic fish abundance, intra- and inter-specific trophic interactions could have a strong impact on the recruitment variability (e. g. anchovy). Egg cannibalism observed in anchovies has been postulated to be a mechanism that determines the upper limit of the population density and self-regulates the population abundance of the species. On the other hand, predation by other guild species is commonly considered as a regulation mechanism between competing species. This study provides empirical evidence of anchovy cannibalism and predation of the main small pelagic fish species on anchovy eggs and estimates the effect of intraguild predation on the anchovy egg mortality rate. Results show that, depending on the year (2008 – 2009), up to 33 % of the total anchovy egg mortality was the result of sardine predation and up to 4 % was the result of egg cannibalism together with predation by Atlantic and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> and sprat. Results also indicate that in the Bay of Biscay, fluctuations in the survival index of the early life stages of anchovy are likely to be attributable at least in part to egg cannibalism and especially to a high sardine predation on anchovy eggs. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelber...|$|E
40|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomber colias, Gmelin, 1978) is a middle-sized {{pelagic fish}} {{distributed}} in warm and temperate Northeast Atlantic waters. The {{bulk of the}} catches takes place in north western waters of Africa, but landing are significantly increased {{in the most recent}} years in the Iberian Peninsula, resulting a new target species for both Portuguese and Spanish purse seiner fleets which partially replaces the important drop of sardine landings in both countries. Given this increasing importance and the lack, for the time being, of any scientific assessment, nor management plan and in order to update the available biological and catch information on this specie in Spanish Atlantic waters, this paper working document compile, review and analyze the existing data of biology, fisheries, and surveys to further enhance knowledge on chub mackerel in Atlantic Iberian waters (ICES Subdivisions 9. a South & North and Division 8. c), specifically: (i) stock structure, (ii) spatial distribution (iii) growth and reproduction and (iv) fisheries exploitation. This analysis suggests an increasing trend in Atlantic waters (9 a) in both spatial distribution and abundance, mainly due to the strength of the 2015 and 2016 cohorts. This area, besides, could be considered as a nursery area while the Cantabrian Sea (8 c) is rather main spawning area.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{changes in}} abundance and {{spatial distribution of}} <b>Atlantic</b> <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> in the Portuguese waters and the Spanish waters of the Gulf of Cadiz using data from acoustic surveys from 1995 to 2010 and data from the fishery since 1958. The distribution and dynamics of chub mackerel and sardine (Sardina pilchardus) are compared and species interactions are discussed. From 2007 to 2009, chub mackerel biomass, as measured acoustically, ranged between 69000 and 238000 t concentrated off the western coast (~ 50 %) and in the Gulf of Cadiz (~ 30 %). Portuguese landings have varied with periods of high landings around 1970 and in recent years. Since 1986 landings have been between 4000 and 23000 t. Both survey catches and commercial landings are taken mainly off the southwestern coast and one- to two-year-old individuals (20 - 24 cm) predominate in both. Scarcity of larger individuals may be a consequence of their deeper distribution and avoidance of fishing gear, migration of older individuals {{or a combination of}} both. In years with high abundance, the fishery expands to the northwestern areas of the Iberian Peninsula. The expansion appears to be caused by improved recruitment although other factors might have contributed (such as targeting to compensate for low sardine catches and the appearance of new markets). The complementary spatial distribution of chub mackerel and sardine and the inverse correlations between their frequency of occurrence, landings and recruitment indices suggest some interaction between the dynamics of the two species, possibly associated with climatic variation...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomber colias) is a {{pelagic fish}} {{distributed}} in warm and temperate Atlantic waters {{and in the}} Mediterranean Sea that may be considered the southern congener of Atlantic mackerel (S. scombrus), both species overlapping in Iberian waters. Age determination is an essential feature in fish stock assessment to estimate the rates of mortalities and growth. Chub mackerel is not assessed, but its fishery has increased in northern Iberian Atlantic waters (ICES Div. VIIIc and IXa) and fishery advice of this population may be soon required. The increase in the landings may also reflect a shift in distribution further north possibly associated with climatic variation, and could interact with the population dynamics of other species. Therefore, {{it is important to}} know, as accurate as possible, the growth pattern of this species. The age estimation criteria of chub mackerel are not still internationally standardized and have never been validated or corroborated in Iberian waters. This work presents the growth pattern in southern Bay of Biscay (ICES Div. VIIIc) based on samples from a whole annual period (2011). An attempt of semi-direct validation of the age estimation of this species in the area is performed, at first time, based on the otolith marginal increment and edge analyses. The consistency of the age interpretation is tested by the regularity of the increments formation and the comparison of the lengths at age obtained from direct otolith reading and those from back-calculation.

40|$|The {{suitability}} of using discards from artisanal fisheries as feed for wild-caught Chelidonichthys lucerna (L.) reared in submerged cages in the Adriatic Sea was investigated. Three-hundred juvenile tub gurnard (72. 9 ± 11 g, 18 ± 1 cm) were captured and separated into four circular 35. 3 m 3 submerged cages. Two stocking densities were used: two cages contained 60 fish each (1. 7 fish m- 3; CG-L) and two cages contained 90 fish each (2. 55 fish m- 3; CG-H). Growth performance and survival rates were recorded over a 240 day {{period during which}} tub gurnard were fed with a variety non-target fishery discards, including common crab, sardine, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel,</b> anchovy, and salema. The survival rate was approximately 90 % in both groups (CG-L = 91 % and CG-H = 90 %), with final stocking densities of 0. 32 kg m- 3 and 0. 49 kg m- 3 for the CG-L and CG-H groups, respectively.

However, respective roles of two GtHs in the teleosts are still incompletely characterized due to technical difficulties in the purification of native GtHs. Methods Native FSH and LH were purified from the pituitaries of adult <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Scomber japonicus by anion-exchange chromatography and immunoblotting using specific antisera. The steroidogenic potency of the intact <b>chub</b> <b>mackerel</b> FSH (cmFSH) and LH (cmLH) were evaluated in mid- and late-vitellogenic stage follicles by measuring the level of gonadal steroids, estradiol- 17 beta (Ε 2) and 17, 20 beta-dihydroxy- 4 -pregnen- 3 -one (17, 20 beta-P). In addition, we evaluated the maturation-inducing potency of the GtHs on same stage follicles. Results Both cmFSH and cmLH significantly stimulated E 2 production in mid-vitellogenic stage follicles. In contrast, only LH significantly stimulated the production of 17, 20 beta-P in late-vitellogenic stage follicles.
