I explore what is influencing the current cultural environment and which of those influencers can be shifted to encourage organizational change toward the “ideal” culture that the organization has identified. Using new institutionalism as the theoretical approach, I discuss the significance of institutional forces (such as the economy and the rise in technology) on the cultural elements (i. e. behaviors, ideas, material artifacts and social structures) in the Market Research Department. Lastly, I show that by understanding those institutional influences, I can better assess what cultural elements can be shifted and which cannot. Of the cultural elements that are able to be shifted, I recommend three interventions that the organization should employ: 1) from <b>a</b> contrive <b>culture</b> to <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> of candor, 2) from <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> of division to <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> of cohesion, and 3) from <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> of knowing to <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> of learning...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Despite {{the need}} for <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> of {{learning}} in South African schools, research reveal {{that it is not}} generally encountered. Research also indicates the manifestation of student behavior problems constraining effective learning. Approach: This research study was directed at determining if a link existed between behavior problems and a lack of <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> of learning. The research approach adopted constituted a literature study and a qualitative based, narrative inquiry at a school within a traditionally disadvantaged community. The literature study was undertaken to gain an understanding of the concept âculture of learningâ and its impact as a behavioral determinant. Caring schools as a means to address the problem formed part of the study. Results: Important research findings relate to the correlation between characteristics that give rise to behavioral problems and those associated with a lack of <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> of learning, the role played by âcaring schoolsâ in nurturing <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> of learning and the importance of addressing studentsâ emotional needs for dealing with behavioral problems. Conclusion: The significance of the research is the guidelines proposed for dealing with behavior problems by establishing <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> of learning. Recommended is in-service training of all key stakeholders in the dynamics of establishing <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> of learning and the realization of learnerâs unmeet emotional needs...|$|R
40|$|The current {{importance}} {{attributed to}} the need for <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> of learning would appear to stem from the necessity for people by business and industry with new skill sets that are more effective for dealing with a turbulent global economy and marketplace. As the complexity {{of the world and the}} issues confronting communities, government, business and industry have escalated, so the importance of continuous learning has come to the fore in grappling with these complex issues. The role of schools and other academic institutions in establishing the foundation for <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> of learning it is suggested needs to be questioned, as it would appear that in South Africa, not withstanding numerous calls for such <b>a</b> <b>culture,</b> the situation appears to have deteriorated, instead of improving. With this as background the focus in this paper is on gaining an insight into what constitutes <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> of learning, the economic imperative for the development of such <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> and the means whereby it may be achieved. An important conclusion made is that the assumption of being able to manage the concept culture intentionally is in effect flawed. An alternative complex adaptive systems approach is suggested as a possible solution to the difficulty encountered in engendering <b>a</b> <b>culture</b> of learning in South African institutions...|$|R
