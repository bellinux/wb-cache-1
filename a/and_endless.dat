5|$|The {{worship of}} the lingam {{originated}} from the famous hymn in the Atharva-Veda Samhitâ sung in praise of the Yupa-Stambha, the sacrificial post. In that hymn, a description is found of the beginningless <b>and</b> <b>endless</b> Stambha or Skambha, and it is shown that the said Skambha is put {{in place of the}} eternal Brahman. Just as the Yajna (sacrificial) fire, its smoke, ashes, and flames, the Soma plant, and the ox that used to carry on its back the wood for the Vedic sacrifice gave place to the conceptions of the brightness of Shiva's body, his tawny matted hair, his blue throat, and the riding on the bull of the Shiva, the Yupa-Skambha gave place in time to the Shiva-Linga. In the text Linga Purana, the same hymn is expanded in the shape of stories, meant to establish the glory of the great Stambha and the superiority of Shiva as Mahadeva.|$|E
5|$|Toby Creek's {{watershed}} {{is in part}} or all of 14 municipalities. It is in ten boroughs: Swoyersville, Pringle, Luzerne, Larksville, Kingston, Harveys Lake, Fort Fort, Edwardsville, Dallas, and Courtdale. It is also in four townships: Lehman Township, Kingston Township, Jackson Township, and Dallas Township. It is {{adjacent to}} watersheds {{such as those of}} Harveys Creek and Abrahams Creek. A 9-mile (15-kilometer) long stretch of land along the main stem of Toby Creek is highly urbanized. This stretch of land begins in Dallas, near the creek's headwaters, and passes through Shavertown, Luzerne, Kingston, and Edwardsville. Both the Back Mountain <b>and</b> <b>Endless</b> Mountain regions are associated with the creek's watershed and are adjacent to it.|$|E
5|$|IV. Rondo: Allegretto – Presto. This lyrical rondo {{movement}} {{consists of}} flowing triplet movement <b>and</b> <b>endless</b> songful melody. Its form is a sonata-rondo (A–B–A–development–A–B–A–coda). The Rondo's main and opening theme {{is taken from}} the slow movement of the sonata D. 537 of 1817. Charles Fisk {{has pointed out that}} this theme would make musical sense as a response subsequent to the questioning leading tone that closes the Allegro's opening fanfare; in this capacity the Rondo's lyricism is the dramatically delayed final goal of the sonata. The second thematic group is written in the traditional dominant key; however, it is very long, modulating through many different subdominant tonalities. The development section, in contrast, culminates in a long passage in C-sharp minor with a climax characterized by a tension-building ambiguity between E major and C-sharp minor and a greatly prolonged evasion of a cadence. This leads to a false recapitulation in F-sharp major, which then modulates to begin again in the home key. In the coda, the main theme returns fragmented, with full bar pauses, which lead each time to unexpected changes of key. This is followed by an agitated presto section, based on the final bars of the main theme, and the sonata concludes with a bold evocation of its very opening measures, with an ascending arpeggio (essentially an inversion of the descending figure from the Allegro's second phrase), followed by a fortissimo full statement of the opening fanfare in retrograde.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Stardock {{released}} {{a remake of}} Galactic Civilizations, which was praised by reviewers who saw the game {{as a replacement for}} the Master of Orion series. In 2004 the Creative Assembly released the critically acclaimed , which has spawned many sequels. Civilization IV was {{released a}}t the end of 2005 and was considered the PC game of the year according to several reviewers, including GameSpot and GameSpy. It is now considered one of the greatest computer games in history, having been ranked the second-best PC game of all time by IGN. By 2008, the Civilization series had sold over eight million copies, followed the release of Civilization Revolution for game consoles soon after, Civilization V in 2010, and Civilization VI in 2016. Meanwhile, Stardock released , which was considered the sixth-best PC game of 2006 by GameSpy. Additionally, French developer Amplitude Studios released both Endless Space <b>and</b> <b>Endless</b> Legend. These successes have led Stardock's Brad Wardell to assert that 4X games have excellent growth potential, particularly among less hardcore players. This is in addition to the loyal base of 4X gamers who have supported free software releases such as Freeciv, FreeCol, Freeorion, Golden Age of Civilizations, and C-evo.|$|E

25|$|In some stories, the {{question}} remains unresolved of whether formal justice will ever be delivered, such as Five Little Pigs <b>and</b> <b>Endless</b> Night. According to P. D.

25|$|The {{proposition}} is peace.

It is peace sought in the spirit of peace, and laid in principles purely pacific.|$|E
25|$|At the end, in a Christie hallmark, {{the detective}} usually gathers the {{surviving}} suspects into one room, explains {{the course of}} his deductive reasoning, and reveals the guilty party, although there are exceptions in which it is left to the guilty party to explain all (such as And Then There Were None <b>and</b> <b>Endless</b> Night, both rather nihilistic in nature).|$|E

25|$|When {{the series}} Judge Dredd was being {{developed}} in 1976–77 {{it was originally}} planned that the story would be set in New York, in the near future. However, when artist Carlos Ezquerra drew his first story for the series, a skyscraper {{in the background of}} one panel looked so futuristic that editor Pat Mills instructed him to draw a full-page poster of the city. Ezquerra's vision of the city – with massive tower blocks <b>and</b> <b>endless</b> roads suspended vast distances above the ground with no visible means of support – was so futuristic that it prompted a rethink, and a whole new city was proposed. Art director Doug Church suggested that the city should extend along the entire Eastern Seaboard, and be called Mega-City One, and his idea was adopted.|$|E
25|$|Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies was a keen cricket fan and {{the match}} between his Prime Minister's XI and the touring team {{was one of}} the social {{highlights}} of the tour with an official reception the night before the match. Cricketers can become jaded over official functions <b>and</b> <b>endless</b> speeches as the tour progresses, but Menzies was a marvellous after-dinner speaker and proved to be highly entertaining. Five Australian captains graced his team; Lindsay Hassett, Ian Johnson, Arthur Morris, Ian Craig and Ray Lindwall as did the all-rounder Sam Loxton and a Victorian wicket-keeper called Les Botham. They batted first and the opener Morris hit 14 boundaries in his 79 and Brian James, a New South Wales Country player hit 5 sixes in his 88 before retiring hurt. Tom Graveney took 2/38 with his leg-spin and Jim Laker 2/61. They declared on 288/7 off 38 eight-ball overs in two hours and thirty-five minutes, leaving the MCC roughly the same number of overs in slightly less time. Peter Richardson was out for a duck to Lindwall, Ted Dexter thrashed 76 before hitting his wicket and Colin Cowdrey struck 101 runs in 84 minutes with 10 boundaries to win the match by four wickets. He batted on for his century before he was caught by Hassett off Morris (4/46), who ran through the lower order with his part-time leg-spin and they were all out for 332.|$|E
