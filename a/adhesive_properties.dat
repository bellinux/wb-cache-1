5|$|At {{his trial}} in Clearwater, Florida, Chandler {{said that he}} met the Rogers women and gave them directions, but he never saw them again except in {{newspaper}} coverage and on billboards. He never told the authorities {{that he had seen}} the women again. He acknowledged that he was on Tampa Bay that nightthe police had evidence of three ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home during the time frame of the murdersbut Chandler maintained that he was fishing alone. He claimed that he had returned home late because his engine would not start, which he attributed to a gas line leak. He said that he had called the Coast Guard and the Florida Marine Patrol, and had flagged down a patrol boat, but both were too busy to help. He said that he subsequently fixed the line with duct tape and returned safely to shore. However, there were no records of distress calls from Chandler to either the Coast Guard or the Marine Patrol that night, nor were there any Coast Guard boats on the bay the following morning that could have helped him. According to a boat mechanic, who testified for the prosecution, Chandler's explanation of repairing the boat's alleged gas leak was not tenable because the fuel lines in his boata Baylinerwere directed upward. A leak would have sprayed fuel into the air rather than into the boat, and the corrosive gasoline would have eaten away the <b>adhesive</b> <b>properties</b> of the duct tape Chandler maintained he had used to repair the purported leak. Under interrogation from Pinellas County prosecutor, Douglas Crow, Chandler then said he could not remember.|$|E

The interfacial <b>adhesive</b> <b>property</b> between the inserted part and an injected polymer was investigated. The glass fiber reinforced polypropylene (GF/PP) with various adhesive lengths of 0, 5, 10 and 15 mm was prepared as the inserted part. Polypropylene was injected to the mold. The effects of the inserted parts surface roughness, pre-heated the inserted parts and the barrel temperature on the <b>adhesive</b> <b>property</b> of GF/PP-PP injection molded were studied. It was found that interfacial <b>adhesive</b> <b>property</b> of GF/PP-PP insert injection molded increased according with increasing of surface roughness, pre-heated the insert part and increasing the barrel temperature.

25|$|Although {{some of the}} {{properties}} of PfEMP1 were firmly established, the protein was difficult to isolate due to its low occurrence. Five years after its discovery, {{one of the original}} researchers Irwin Sherman began to doubt the existence of PfEMP1 as a unique protein. He argued that the antigen could be merely a surface protein of RBCs that changes upon infection with malarial parasites. A consensus was achieved in 1995 following the identification (by cloning) of the gene for PfEMP1. The discovery of the genes was independently reported by Howard's team and two other teams at NIH. Howard's team identified two genes for PfEMP1, and recombinant protein products of these genes were shown to have antigenic and <b>adhesive</b> <b>properties.</b> They further affirmed that PfEMP1 is the key molecule in the ability of P. falciparum to evade the host's immune system. Joseph D. Smith and others showed that PfEMP1 is actually a large family of proteins encoded by a multigene family called var. The gene products can bind to a variety of receptors including those on endothelial cells. Xin-Zhuan Su and others showed that there could be more than 50 var genes which are distributed on different chromosomes of the malarial parasite.|$|E

2500|$|Born in Wylam in 1786, Timothy Hackworth was {{the eldest}} son of John Hackworth who {{occupied}} the position of foreman blacksmith at Wylam Colliery {{until his death in}} 1804; the father had already acquired a considerable reputation as a mechanical worker and boiler maker. At the end of his apprenticeship in 1807 Timothy took over his father's position.

Blackett set up a four-man working group including himself, William Hedley, the viewer; Timothy Hackworth, the new foreman smith and Jonathan Foster, a [...] "wright".

The basic properties of COPNA resin and modified resin were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-NMR), vapor pressure osmometry (VPO) and elemental analysis (EA). Average structural parameters of resins were calculated by the improved Brown-Ladner method, and heat resistance of resins was tested by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The chemical structure, mechanical properties and heat resistivity of the resin/graphite composites prepared with different resins were compared. The {{results show that the}} <b>adhesive</b> <b>property</b> and heat resistance of COPNA resin can be remarkably improved by addition of 5 wt.% epoxy resin.

40|$|During {{eosinophil}} (EOS) accumulation {{at sites}} of allergic inflammation, an initial step is the binding of EOS to adhesion molecules expressed on vascular endothelial cells (EC). We have previously observed that adhesion of peripheral blood EOS to recombinant human vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (rh-VCAM- 1) stimulates the respiratory burst of EOS. Although the biological {{consequence of this}} activation remains to be elucidated, reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) may modify the <b>adhesive</b> <b>property</b> of EOS. In the present study, we examined whether H 2 O 2 modifies the <b>adhesive</b> <b>property</b> of EOS. EOS were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy subjects. Adhesion of the EOS to paraformaldehyde-fixed human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC), stimulated or not stimulated with tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α; 100 pm for 24 hr), was examined in {{the presence or absence}} of H 2 O 2. H 2 O 2 significantly enhanced adhesion of EOS to both resting and TNF-α-stimulated fixed HUVEC (P < 0 · 01, respectively). Such enhancing effects were inhibited by anti-β 2 integrin antibody or anti-CD 11 b antibody, but not by anti-CD 11 a or anti-α 4 integrin antibody. H 2 O 2 also enhanced EOS adhesion to rh-intracellular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) but not to rh-VCAM- 1. Finally, H 2 O 2 enhanced the expression of both CD 11 b and CD 18 on EOS.

Considering the effect to leucocyte during the extracorporeal circulation, there are three factors, that is heparin, mechanical acting of heart-lung machine and massive transfusion.

Massive transfusion decrease the {{white blood cell count}} by means of dilution. And both impaired <b>adhesive</b> <b>property,</b> phagocytic property and ameboid motility. Clinically, using agglutination test and antihumanglobulin consumption test, leucocyte antibody were examined in 30 cases performed extracorporeal circulation and 20 cases with preserved blood transfusion in general surgery. Complete antibody was seen in one case (3. 3 %). incomplete antibody was in 8 cases (26. 7 %) with extracorporeal circulation. In 2 cases with preserved blood transfusion (10 %) incomplete antibody was also seen. Those revealed one massive transfusion might produce the leucocyte antibody. The effect to blood coagulation of white blood cell or homogenized white blood cell, which were separated after extracorporeal circulation, were experimentally studied. White blood cell depressed the 1 st phase of blood coagulation, and homogenized cell depressed the 1 st and 2 nd phase. Both two promoted the fibrinolysis.
