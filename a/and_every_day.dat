5|$|The {{victory was}} well {{received}} among the Albanians, and Skanderbeg's recruits increased as documented by Geraldini: Skanderbeg {{was in his}} camp with 16,000 men <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> his camp grows with young warriors. The victory was also well received in Italy with contemporaries hoping for more such news. But, despite the Ottoman loss, the victory did not signal {{an end to the}} war. Skanderbeg's damaged forces, however, had been renewed with northern warriors and Venetian battalions. The situation remained critical, however, due to the economic hardships suffered during the siege. Skanderbeg's only expectancy was for help to come from Italy, but the Italian states, despite sending contragulatory messages, send no financial aid. Hungary continued its defensive war and thus Skanderbeg's only remaining ally was Venice. Even Venice became skeptical of continuing the war and was alone in allying with Skanderbeg. Venice reported to Hungary that Mehmed had offered peace and was willing to accept it. Hungary also opted for peace, but Mehmed only sought peace with Venice in order to isolate Skanderbeg and thus peace was not signed. Skanderbeg and Venice continually began to worry about the Ottoman garrison in Elbasan. Skanderbeg led some assaults on the fortress after being urged to by Venice but failed to capture it due to lack of artillery. According to Critobulos, Mehmed was troubled after learning of the Ottoman defeat and began preparations for a new campaign. Venice itself was in conflict with its Italian neighbors who had grown wary of its increasing influence in the Balkans. With the western powers fighting among themselves, the road to Albania was open. Mehmed thus decided to send a force to subdue Albania conclusively which resulted in a new siege on Krujë.|$|E

25|$|Orthodox Judaism {{believes}} in the rebuilding of a Third Temple and the resumption of Korban (sacrificial worship), although there is disagreement about how rebuilding should take place. Orthodox scholars and rabbinic authorities generally believe that rebuilding should occur {{in the era of}} the Jewish Messiah at the hand of Divine Providence, although a minority position, following the opinion of Maimonides, holds that Jews should endeavour to rebuild the temple themselves, whenever possible. Orthodox authorities generally predict the resumption of the complete traditional system of sacrifices, but Conservative, Reform, and Reconstructionist authorities disavow all belief in the resumption of Korban. This belief is embedded in Orthodox Jewish prayer services. Three times a day, Orthodox Jews recite the Amidah, which contains prayers for the Temple's restoration and for sacrificial worship's resumption, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> there is a recitation of the order of the day's sacrifices and the psalms the Levites would have sung that day.|$|E

Baba went to Lendi Baug daily <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> he threw some silver coins in the 'Lendi' ('Well'). Baba was also known to test his devotees to see if they hankered after money and gold. Baba used to come here every morning and afternoon entering alone through the west and rest under a Neem tree. Sai Baba also dug a pit, 2 feet deep, under the Neem tree and kept an earthen lamp lit continuously. Lendi Baug also has a well which was dug by Baba and his devotees.|$|E

She requested that he keep Kaycee's identity secret. Van der Woning did as requested and kept the information to himself; however, this had the side effect of allowing the Metafilter investigation to continue. As more and more evidence mounted {{that the story of}} Kaycee had been cobbled together using misdirection and borrowed facts, Swenson emailed the truth to him, and he, in turn, posted it to the In Living Colours blog on May 20: Kaycee Nicole had never existed. [...] "I didn't know the reactions would be so strong", Swenson said. [...] "I knew it was wrong <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> it ate at me and I couldn't take it."

She performed the piano version wearing a dress made of plastic transparent bubbles and playing the glass piano with her stilletoes with a glowing mannequin, like the music video, {{standing in front of the}} stage. Gaga claimed that the transparent bubble filled piano was specifically made to match her dress.

[...] Gaga wore a nude corseted leotard embellished with crystals and an admiral's hat during the performance. The hat as well as the fingerless gloves worn were decorated with the word Gaga on it.|$|E

500|$|The {{environment}} in Lody's boarding-house was becoming increasingly hostile; his hosts were growing suspicious of him. Their doubts grew as the ongoing espionage scare progressed. He had {{stayed there for}} more than three weeks and his evasive answers when questioned about when he expected to leave did not satisfy them. When they said that his accent appeared to be [...] "more German than American", he knew it was time to go. He wrote in his letter of 27 September that [...] "the fear of espionage is very great <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> I see some Germans going to Redford Barracks under the escort of a soldier... It is advisable for me to vanish for a few days, and to change my place of abode. I can only hope that my telegraphic and letter information have duly arrived."

Despite his hopes, his letter was intercepted by the British; this time it was retained as the information therein was of genuine military value.|$|E
500|$|... "Lose My Breath" [...] {{was written}} by Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams, Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins, Fred Jerkins, Sean Garrett, LaShawn Daniels and Jay-Z. The {{production}} of the song was handled by Jerkins, Beyoncé, Rowland and Garrett. Record producer Jerkins, who had previously collaborated with the group for [...] "Say My Name" [...] (2000), had worked on [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] without informing Destiny's Child. Beyoncé and Williams heard the drum instrumentation of the track and they enjoyed it with the latter feeling that the song was nothing like the mainstream radio sound. They went to their band mate Kelly Rowland presenting the song. Alongside Jerkins, the group asked for help from American rapper Jay-Z who immediately created a chorus including the lines [...] "Can you keep up" [...] without hearing the track. The group took his chorus and wrote the verses and bridge around it. During an interview with Complex, Garrett recalled the time he worked with Williams on the song, saying, [...] "There was so much magic {{going on in the}} studio. We probably recorded all the songs in about a month <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> it was a new song coming out. 'Lose My Breath' was towards {{the latter part of the}} album and that was an amazing song that we felt could not only be big on the radio but big with bands and marching bands. I was on a natural high after that." ...|$|E
500|$|In monasteries, {{the basic}} {{structure}} of the diet was laid down by the Rule of Saint Benedict in the 7th century and tightened by Pope Benedict XII in 1336, but (as mentioned above) monks were adept at [...] "working around" [...] these rules. Wine was restricted to about [...] per day, but there was no corresponding limit on beer, and, at Westminster Abbey, each monk was given an allowance of [...] of beer per day. Meat of [...] "four-footed animals" [...] was prohibited altogether, year-round, for everyone but the very weak and the sick. This was circumvented in part by declaring that offal, and various processed foods such as bacon, were not meat. Secondly, Benedictine monasteries contained a room called the misericord, where the Rule of Saint Benedict did not apply, and where a large number of monks ate. Each monk would be regularly sent either to the misericord or to the refectory. When Pope Benedict XII ruled that at least half of all monks should be required to eat in the refectory on any given day, monks responded by excluding the sick and those invited to the abbot's table from the reckoning. Overall, a monk at Westminster Abbey in the late 15th century would have been allowed [...] of bread per day; 5 eggs per day, except on Fridays and in Lent; [...] of meat per day, 4 days/week (excluding Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday), except in Advent and Lent; and [...] of fish per day, 3 days/week <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> during Advent and Lent. This caloric structure partly reflected the high-class status of late Medieval monasteries in England, and partly that of Westminster Abbey, {{which was one of the}} richest monasteries in the country; diets of monks in other monasteries may have been more modest.|$|E
