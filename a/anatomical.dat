5|$|In general, {{motion is}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} <b>anatomical</b> plane it occurs in. Flexion and extension are examples of angular motions, in which two axes of a joint are brought closer together or moved further apart. Rotational motion may occur at other joints, for example the shoulder, and are described as internal or external. Other terms, such as elevation and depression, describe movement above or below the horizontal plane. Many <b>anatomical</b> terms derive from Latin terms with the same meaning.|$|E
5|$|In the Hebrew Bible, {{the word}} for heart, lev, is used in these meanings, as the seat of emotion, the mind, and {{referring}} to the <b>anatomical</b> organ. It is also connected in function and symbolism to the stomach.|$|E
5|$|Motion, {{the process}} of movement, is {{described}} using specific <b>anatomical</b> terms. Motion includes movement of organs, joints, limbs, and specific sections of the body. The terminology used describes this motion according to its direction relative to the <b>anatomical</b> position of the joints. Anatomists use a unified set of terms to describe most of the movements, although other, more specialized terms are necessary for describing {{the uniqueness of the}} movements such as those of the hands, feet, and eyes.|$|E

5|$|The 2014 study defined Deinocheiridae as a clade {{including}} all taxa {{with a more}} recent common ancestor with Deinocheirusmirificus than with Ornithomimusvelox. The three members share various <b>anatomical</b> features in the limbs. The 2014 cladogram suggested that ornithomimosaurians diverged into two major lineages in the Early Cretaceous; Deinocheiridae and Ornithomimidae. Unlike other ornithomimosaurians, deinocheirids were not built for running. The <b>anatomical</b> peculiarities of Deinocheirus when compared to other, much smaller ornithomimosaurs, can largely be explained by its much larger size and weight. Deinocheirids and the smaller ornithomimids did not have teeth, unlike more primitive ornithomimosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The Society had an {{expansive}} <b>Anatomical</b> Cabinet, begun in 1828, {{the year of}} its founding.|$|E
5|$|The Society's medical {{collections}} were {{donated to}} the Warren <b>Anatomical</b> Museum around 1870, while its library was absorbed into the Boston Medical Library in 1875.|$|E
5|$|There is <b>anatomical</b> and {{trackway}} {{evidence that}} this talon was held {{up off the ground}} while the dinosaur walked on the third and fourth toes.|$|E
5|$|These direct pain inputs, {{as well as}} {{indirect}} inputs, {{are thought}} to induce long-term pain avoidance behavior that results in chronic posture changes and consequently, in functional and <b>anatomical</b> remodeling of vestibular and proprioceptive nuclei. As a result, chronic neuropathic pain can induce macroscopic <b>anatomical</b> remodeling of the hindbrain, including the cerebellum. The magnitude of this remodeling and the induction of neuron progenitor markers suggest the contribution of adult neurogenesis to these changes.|$|E
5|$|All pulmonate {{land snails}} are hermaphrodites, {{and have a}} {{complete}} and rather elaborate set of {{both male and female}} reproductive organs (see the simplified <b>anatomical</b> diagram above), but the majority of pulmonate land snails have no love darts and no dart sac.|$|E
5|$|Another edition in quarto format {{was printed}} by the Imprimerie royale in 36 volumes (1774–1804). It {{consisted}} of 28 volumes par Buffon, and 8 volumes by Lacépède. The part containing <b>anatomical</b> articles by Louis Jean-Marie Daubenton was dropped. The supplements were merged into the relevant {{articles in the}} main volumes.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the great}} range of <b>anatomical</b> {{diversity}} among molluscs, many textbooks start the subject of molluscan anatomy by describing what is called an archi-mollusc, hypothetical generalized mollusc, or hypothetical ancestral mollusc (HAM) to illustrate the most common features found within the phylum. The depiction is visually rather similar to modern monoplacophorans, and some suggest it may resemble very early molluscs.|$|E
5|$|Buffon {{attached}} much {{importance to}} the illustrations; Jacques de Sève illustrated the quadrupeds and François-Nicolas Martinet illustrated the birds. Nearly 2000 plates adorn the work, representing animals with care given both to aesthetics and <b>anatomical</b> accuracy, with dreamlike and mythological settings.|$|E
5|$|Burke's {{skeleton}} {{was given}} to the <b>Anatomical</b> Museum of the Edinburgh Medical School where, as of 2016, it remains. His death mask and a book said to be bound with his tanned skin can be seen at Surgeons' Hall Museum.|$|E
5|$|Congenital {{disorders}} include cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypoplasia (an incomplete {{development of}} the lungs)congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and infant respiratory distress syndrome caused by a deficiency in lung surfactant. An azygos lobe is a congenital <b>anatomical</b> variation which though usually without effect can cause problems in thoracoscopic procedures.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{painters}} {{are also}} inspired by El Greco's art. Kysa Johnson used El Greco's {{paintings of the}} Immaculate Conception as the compositional framework for some of her works, and the master's <b>anatomical</b> distortions are somewhat reflected in Fritz Chesnut's portraits.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{distinctive}} position, the foramen {{is used as}} an <b>anatomical</b> landmark during neurosurgery. As a landmark, the foramen spinosum reveals the positions of other cranial foramina, the mandibular nerve and trigeminal ganglion, foramen ovale, and foramen rotundum. It may also be relevant in achieving haemostasis during trauma surgery.|$|E
5|$|He {{examines}} {{in detail}} the expression of evolutionary stages {{in the development of}} embryos, tracing from the process of cell division to the development of specific <b>anatomical</b> features. He finds a striking resemblance between the embryonic development of reptiles and birds, including details of the skeletal anatomy (with special attention to the hands and feet) and various organs. He notes that bird and reptile embryos develop visceral arches, hinting at their aquatic ancestry. Of more interest to his goal, Heilmann writes in a similar vein that the embryos of certain birds clearly show a three-clawed finger structure, at least one of which (the hoatzin) retains actual claws after hatching. He mentions other <b>anatomical</b> features of bird embryos that hint at their reptilian ancestry as well, such as the embryonic splitting of the pygostyle into distinct separate vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the Federative Committee on <b>Anatomical</b> Terminology {{accepted}} female prostate as {{an accurate}} {{term for the}} Skene's gland, which {{is believed to be}} found in the G-spot area along the walls of the urethra. The male prostate is biologically homologous to the Skene's gland; it has been unofficially called the male G-spot because it can also be used as an erogenous zone.|$|E
5|$|In Aristotle's time, the 4th century BCE, {{porpoises}} {{were regarded}} as fish due to their superficial similarity. Aristotle, however, could already see many physiological and <b>anatomical</b> similarities with the terrestrial vertebrates, such as blood (circulation), lungs, uterus and fin anatomy. His detailed descriptions were assimilated by the Romans, but mixed with a more accurate knowledge of the dolphins, as mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his “Natural history”. In the art of this and subsequent periods, porpoises are portrayed with a long snout (typical of dolphins) and a high-arched head. The harbour porpoise {{was one of the}} most accessible species for early cetologists, because it could be seen very close to land, inhabiting shallow coastal areas of Europe. Much of the findings that apply to all cetaceans were first discovered in porpoises. One of the first <b>anatomical</b> descriptions of the airways of the whales on the basis of a harbor porpoise dates from 1671 by John Ray. It nevertheless referred to the porpoise as a fish.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Campanian of North America, Daspletosaurus was a {{contemporary}} of the albertosaurine tyrannosaurid Gorgosaurus. This {{is one of}} the few examples of two tyrannosaur genera coexisting. In modern predator guilds, similar-sized predators are separated into different ecological niches by <b>anatomical,</b> behavioral or geographical differences that limit competition. Several studies have attempted to explain niche differentiation in Daspletosaurus and Gorgosaurus.|$|E
5|$|It {{is usually}} easy to {{recognise}} {{that a particular}} insect is a bee. They differ from closely related groups such as wasps by having branched or plume-like setae (bristles), combs on the forelimbs for cleaning their antennae, small <b>anatomical</b> differences in the limb structure and the venation of the hind wings, and in females, by having the seventh dorsal abdominal plate divided into two half-plates.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) {{was trained}} in anatomy by Andrea del Verrocchio. He {{made use of}} his <b>anatomical</b> {{knowledge}} in his artwork, making many sketches of skeletal structures, muscles and organs of humans and other vertebrates that he dissected.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo {{started his}} {{study in the}} anatomy {{of the human body}} under the {{apprenticeship}} of Andrea del Verrocchio, who demanded that his students develop a deep knowledge of the subject. As an artist, he quickly became master of topographic anatomy, drawing many studies of muscles, tendons and other visible <b>anatomical</b> features.|$|E
5|$|Louis Jean-Marie Daubenton {{assisted}} Buffon on the quadrupeds; Philippe Guéneau de Montbeillard {{worked on}} the birds. They were joined, from 1767, by Barthélemy Faujas de Saint-Fond, the abbot Gabriel Bexon and Charles-Nicolas-Sigisbert Sonnini de Manoncourt. The whole descriptive and <b>anatomical</b> part of l’Histoire des Quadrupèdes {{was the work of}} Daubenton and Jean-Claude Mertrud.|$|E
5|$|Opisthobranch {{gastropods}} are hermaphrodites, {{as are the}} pulmonates; however, opisthobranchs do {{not have}} love darts. Nonetheless, {{some of them do}} stab one another during mating, using hardened <b>anatomical</b> structures. For example, in the Cephalaspidean genus Siphopteron, both seaslugs attempt to stab their partner with a two-part, spined penis.|$|E
5|$|Originally, plantar {{fasciitis}} {{was believed}} to be an inflammatory condition of the plantar fascia. However, within the last decade, studies have observed microscopic <b>anatomical</b> changes indicating that plantar fasciitis is actually due to a noninflammatory structural breakdown of the plantar fascia rather than an inflammatory process.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1900, the {{similarity}} in {{shape of the}} shell of Amphidromus to that of South American tree snails in the family Bulimulidae had misled taxonomists. However, the dissections made by Wiegmann and Jacobi clearly showed that the inner <b>anatomical</b> features of Amphidromus {{were the same as}} those of the Asian-Indonesian Camaenidae, and that the resemblance of the shell of Amphidromus to that of bulimulids was merely an example of parallelism.|$|E
5|$|René Descartes {{proposed}} {{the theory of}} dualism to tackle {{the issue of the}} brain's relation to the mind. He suggested that the pineal gland was where the mind interacted with the body after recording the brain mechanisms responsible for circulating cerebrospinal fluid. This dualism likely provided impetus for later anatomists to further explore the relationship between the <b>anatomical</b> and functional aspects of brain anatomy.|$|E
5|$|Smaller {{than other}} dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus and Achillobator, Velociraptor {{nevertheless}} shared {{many of the}} same <b>anatomical</b> features. It was a bipedal, feathered carnivore with a long tail and an enlarged sickle-shaped claw on each hindfoot, which is thought to have been used to tackle and disembowel prey. Velociraptor can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low skull, with an upturned snout.|$|E
5|$|Superficial or surface anatomy is {{important}} as the study of <b>anatomical</b> landmarks that can be readily seen from the exterior contours of the body. It enables physicians or veterinary surgeons to gauge the position and anatomy of the associated deeper structures. Superficial is a directional term that indicates that structures are located relatively {{close to the surface}} of the body.|$|E
5|$|TBI {{is usually}} {{classified}} based on severity, <b>anatomical</b> {{features of the}} injury, and the mechanism (the causative forces). Mechanism-related classification divides TBI into closed and penetrating head injury. A closed (also called nonpenetrating, or blunt) injury occurs when the brain is not exposed. A penetrating, or open, head injury occurs when an object pierces the skull and breaches the dura mater, the outermost membrane surrounding the brain.|$|E
5|$|The <b>anatomical</b> {{structure}} of the internal organs and tissues of the female reproductive tract provides a pathway for pathogens to ascend from the vagina to the pelvic cavity thorough the infundibulum. The disturbance of the naturally occurring vaginal microbiota associated with bacterial vaginosis {{increases the risk of}} PID.|$|E
