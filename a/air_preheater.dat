Necessary safety valves are located at suitable points to relieve excessive boiler pressure. The air and flue gas path equipment include: forced draft (FD) fan, <b>air</b> <b>preheater</b> (AP), boiler furnace, induced draft (ID) fan, fly ash collectors (electrostatic precipitator or baghouse) and the flue gas stack.|$|E
25|$|Maximum {{supplementary}} firing {{refers to}} the maximum fuel that can be fired with the oxygen available in the gas turbine exhaust. The steam cycle is conventional with reheat and regeneration. Hot gas turbine exhaust is used as the combustion air. Regenerative <b>air</b> <b>preheater</b> is not required. A fresh air fan which {{makes it possible to}} operate the steam plant even when the gas turbine is not in operation, increases the availability of the unit.|$|E
25|$|As the {{combustion}} flue gas exits the boiler it is routed through a rotating flat basket of metal mesh which picks up heat and returns it to incoming fresh air as the basket rotates. This {{is called the}} <b>air</b> <b>preheater.</b> The gas exiting the boiler is laden with fly ash, which are tiny spherical ash particles. The flue gas contains nitrogen along with combustion products carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. The fly ash is removed by fabric bag filters or electrostatic precipitators. Once removed, the fly ash byproduct can sometimes {{be used in the}} manufacturing of concrete. This cleaning up of flue gases, however, only occurs in plants that are fitted with the appropriate technology. Still, the majority of coal-fired power stations in the world do not have these facilities. Legislation in Europe has been efficient to reduce flue gas pollution. Japan has been using flue gas cleaning technology for over 30 years and the US has been doing the same for over 25 years. China is now beginning to grapple with the pollution caused by coal-fired power stations.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the untypical corrosion resistance of rotary <b>air</b> <b>preheaters</b> in a biomass co-fired power plant. Design/methodology/approach: The selected results of some components of regenerative rotary <b>air</b> <b>preheaters</b> in a biomass co-fired power plant are presented. The macro and microstructure of corroded components of a LUVO preheater after 3 years of service are presented. The chemical composition of corrosion products was determined by X-ray microanalysis. Findings: Data concerning toxicity and identification of PBDEs (Polibrominated diphenyl ethers) in the biomass is very limited. The presented research provides information and the proposed corrosion reaction mechanism in environments containing biomass with aggressive compounds like Cl, Si, H and Br. Research limitations/implications: An extended research on PBDEs in power plant fuels is necessary to give a full assessment of the corrosion mechanism in the presented environment; obligatory classification of the co-fired biomass.

40|$|Cryogenic air-separation {{process cycle}} {{variations}} and compression schemes are examined. They {{are designed to}} minimize net system power required to supply pressurized, oxygen-enriched air to the combustor of an MHD power plant with a coal input of 2000 MWt. Power requirements and capital costs for oxygen production and enriched air compression for enrichment levels from 13 to 50 % are determined. The results are presented as curves from which total compression power requirements can be estimated for any desired enrichment level at any delivery pressure. It is found that oxygen enrichment and recuperative heating of MHD combustor air to 1400 F yields near-term power plant efficiencies in excess of 45 %. A minimum power compression system requires 167 MW to supply 330 lb of oxygen per second and costs roughly 100 million dollars.

40|$|Existing direct fired process heaters {{and steam}} boilers {{can have their}} {{efficiencies}} remarkably improved, and thus cut the fuel bill, by conversion from conventional type natural draft burners to high intensity, "forced draft" type burners. An available type that is "forced draft," but which does not require expenditure of energy for forced draft, will be discussed. Combustion Air is automatically controlled by the fuel flow - which fuel drives the "forced draft" fan to control airflow. Use of such type burners can, in many instances, increase efficiency to a point close enough to that obtainable by addition of air preheat until the difference in efficiency with <b>air</b> <b>preheaters</b> will not justify {{the high cost of}} air preheat systems. Low excess air and short, high intensity flame patterns assure reduction of stack temperature, thus increased efficiency.

40|$|In {{the last}} ten years energy costs have soared. The cost of coal and # 2 fuel oil have gone up by a factor of 3 - 5. Residual fuel oil cost has {{increased}} by approximately ten times. The cost of natural gas has gone up at an even higher rate. This paper reviews methods to conserve energy in industrial boiler water systems. Both mechanical and chemical approaches for energy conservation are discussed. The important aspects of efficient combustion are covered as well as other mechanical factors such as boiler blowdown heat recovery, economizers, <b>air</b> <b>preheaters,</b> and boiler blowdown control. The chemical aspects discussed for energy conservation include fuel additives, boiler internal treatment, and condensate treatments. The emphasis in this paper, for both mechanical and chemical approaches to energy conservation covers three areas: 1) maximizing the use of available Btu's in fuel through more efficient combustion, 2) improving the efficiency of heat transfer, and 3) recovering Btu's that have been previously considered uneconomical...|$|R

40|$|Several {{material}} {{related issues}} {{may arise from}} oxyfuel combustion of coal due {{to the presence of}} CO 2    but also as an effect of the partial recirculation of the flue gas. Two examples are increased corrosion and carburisation which may limit steam data, hence limiting the efficiency. A number of corrosion tests, in both conventional air-firing and oxyfuel mode, have been made in Vattenfalls 30 MW oxyfuel pilot plant located in Schwarze Pumpe, Germany. Internally cooled corrosion probes, equipped with ferritic, austenitic, super austenitic steels as well as Ni-based and FeCrAl alloys, simulating superheaters, economisers and <b>air</b> <b>preheaters</b> were exposed for up to 1500 hrs. The analyses show an indication of higher material wastage in oxyfuel compared to air combustion especially at the lower exposure temperatures. This may be due to increased sulphur concentration in corrosion front, increased heat flux, carburisation or other preciptate formations on austenitic steels and Ni-based alloys.

They can easily be imple-mented as heat exchangers inside sorption and vapour-compression heat pumps, refrigerators {{and other types of}} heat transfer devices. Their heat transfer coefficient in the evaporator and condenser zones is 103 – 105 W/m 2 K, heat pipe thermal resistance is 0. 01 – 0. 03 K/W, therefore leading to smaller area and mass of heat exchangers. Miniature and micro heat pipes are welcomed for electronic components cooling and space two-phase thermal control systems. Loop heat pipes, pulsating heat pipes and sorption heat pipes are the novelty for modern heat exchangers.

40|$|Canada Packers Inc. has {{successfully}} demonstrated condensing flue gas heat recovery and rendering vapour heat recovery under the Federal/Provincial Conservation and Renewable Energy Demonstration Agreement. The condensing flue gas heat recovery system, designed and manufactured by John Thurley Ltd., {{has been in}} operation at the Winnipeg Packinghouse Plant since the summer of 1982. It is capable of recovering about {{four times as much}} heat as conventional systems, such as economizers and combustion <b>air</b> <b>preheaters.</b> This is due to its ability to recover latent heat by condensing the flue gas water vapour, and to recover a greater portion of the sensible heat. As a result, the exit flue gas temperature is reduced to about 30 C. The heat recovery system is capable of heating water to about 60 C, thus it is ideally suited to operations which require large quantities of hot water, At Winnipeg the pre-heated water is used for processing, sanitation and boiler make-up. The rendering vapour heat recovery system, in operation at the Moose Jaw Packinghouse Plant since December 1982, recovers previously lost waste heat produced by four batch inedible rendering cookers. The vapour, which has the properties of atmospheric saturated steam, is used to preheat city water to about 65 C, by means of a spiral heat exchanger.

40|$|A part of {{this thesis}} {{has been devoted to}} present general {{recuperator}} technology such as available gas turbine recuperator types, applications where recuperators are utilized, recuperator materials etc. An investigation of some compact and highly efficient heat transfer surfaces, for intended use in gas turbine recuperators, include the following surfaces: · Cross Wavy (CW) primary surface. · Corrugated Undulated (CU) primary surface. The CU surface is a relatively new surface which is projected for use in <b>air</b> <b>preheaters</b> · Cross Corrugated (CC) primary surface. The CC surface is familiar from the process industry (often called chevron type or herring bone pattern) but is so far not used in any commercially available gas turbine recuperator · A plate-fin type configuration, called the off-set strip fin is. The method of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been used for prediction of thermal performance and pressure losses of the CU and CW surfaces above. In this thesis a specific variant of the CW surface has been considered, called the Trapezoidal Cross Wavy (TCW) surface. This surface may be used in applications having larger hydraulic diameter than the small dimensions used in modern gas turbine recuperators. Design calculations of a recuperator heat transfer matrix were performed using configurations of the above surface types for a specific 50 kW microturbine. In these calculations the hydraulic diameter is equal for all configurations enabling comparison of the thermal and hydraulic performances of the surfaces. The results are presented as heat transfer matrix volumes and weights. The CC surface configurations give the smallest volume and weights of the heat transfer matrix for the specific microturbine recuperator. The straight corrugations of the CC surface should also be easier to fabricate by a stamping, pressing or folding process. It is concluded that the CC surface has potential to give a smaller volume and weight of a recuperator than any commercially available unit today...|$|R
