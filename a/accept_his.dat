5|$|Pietro Colonna {{and three}} bishops brought {{the news of}} Morrone's {{election}} to his mountain-top hermitage. Contemporary sources are emphatic in noting Morrone's reluctance to <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> election; for example, Petrarch recounts his attempt to flee.|$|E
5|$|Back at home, Quisling was {{now less}} {{concerned}} about Nasjonal Samling's membership and even wanted action {{to clean up the}} membership list, including purging it of drunkards. On 12 March, Norway officially became a one-party state. In time, criticism of, and resistance to, the party was criminalised, though Quisling expressed regret for having to take this step, hoping that every Norwegian would freely come around to <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> government.|$|E

5|$|C. J. gets emotionally {{involved}} in {{a story about the}} deadly assault on a homosexual youth. She sees {{this as an opportunity to}} push hate crime legislation, but the suggestion finds little support among the others. Reporter Danny Concannon also disagrees, but this encourages her to finally <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> offer of a date, to have him convince her.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary sources {{suggest that}} Morrone was {{hesitant}} to <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> election when {{word of the}} cardinals' decision reached his mountain-top hermitage. His ascetic life left him largely unprepared for the day-to-day responsibilities of the papacy, and he quickly fell {{under the influence of}} the Neapolitan monarchy of Charles of Anjou, to the dissatisfaction of even the pro-Angevin cardinals within the College. Celestine V resigned on 13 December 1294.|$|E
5|$|In October 1913, Tinker and Herrmann conferred, {{leading to}} Tinker signing a {{contract}} to remain the Reds manager for the 1914 season.

5|$|On 28 May the {{conclave}} unanimously elected Orsini as Pope. He had {{not been}} seen as a serious candidate in past conclaves because he did not have political experience. Orsini was 75 at the time, and it took the cardinals two days to convince him to <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> election. He was recorded to have spent the night before his election sleepless and in tears. Even when the cardinals had taken him into the Sistine Chapel for the formal vote to elect him pope after they had been convinced he would accept, he was still unwilling to <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> own election. Ultimately, he only accepted it after being convinced of it by Agustín Pipia the Master of the Dominican Order, of which he was a member. Upon accepting his election, he attempted to take the name Benedict XIV, which would have recognized Antipope Benedict XIII, the last Avignon Pope during the Western Schism. Lawyers from the Roman Curia eventually persuaded Orisini to take the name Benedict XIII.|$|E
5|$|Some {{time after}} the attack, RUC {{officers}} questioned Stephen Travers at Dublin Castle. He subsequently stated they refused to <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> description of the different-coloured beret worn by the soldier with the English accent.

5|$|The Vinaypatrika is {{considered}} {{as the last}} compositions of Tulsidas, believed to be written when Kali Yuga started troubling him. In this work of 279 stanzas, he beseeches Rama to give him Bhakti ("devotion"), and to <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> petition. Tulsidas attests in the last stanza of Vinaypatrika that Rama himself signed the manuscript of the work. The 45th stanza of the Vinaypatrika is sung as the evening Aarti by many Hindus.|$|E

While the Canadiens were defeated in the 1955 Stanley Cup Finals, Richard led Montreal to the 1956 Stanley Cup as he promised.|$|E
5|$|Abandoned by Emperor Manuel, Stephen IV {{approached}} Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor. Around {{the same}} time, {{a group of}} Hungarian barons and prelates {{sent a letter to}} Emperor Frederick, stating that they were willing to <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> suzerainty. Stephen III also dispatched his envoys to Frederick, who decided not to intervene, but ordered his vassalsthe King of Bohemia, the Duke of Austria, and the Margrave of Styriato {{keep an eye on the}} political situation in Hungary. King Vladislaus' son, Sviatopluk, even married Stephen III's sister, Odola. The betrothal of Stephen III to an unnamed daughter of Yaroslav Osmomysl, Prince of Halych, was also arranged around this time.|$|E
5|$|Although Khan {{has bought}} Jasmine a house, she rejects his advances, {{saying that she}} has never seen him as being more than a friend.

Jasmine returns home to see that Khan has filled her house with expensive presents. Her mother is taken aback when Jasmine explains that Khan is a gangster with whom she'd prefer not to associate. Her family questions the sense in rejecting a man as powerful and dangerous as Khan.|$|E

5|$|Bohemond of Tripoli {{regarded}} himself his father's lawful heir, {{because he}} was Bohemond's elder surviving son. He came to Antioch {{at the end of}} 1198 and persuaded the commune to <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> rule. Before long, the younger Bohemond returned to Tripoli, enabling his father to re-take control of state affairs, suggesting that the elder Bohemond had tacitly supported his son's coup. LeoI of Cilicia appealed to the Holy See to protect Raymond-Roupen's interest, but the Knights Templar submitted a complaint against him for refusing to restore Bagras to them.|$|E
5|$|Concerned {{about the}} succession, Henry sought to persuade Louis VI to <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> son, William Adelin, as the {{legitimate}} future Duke of Normandy, {{in exchange for}} his son's homage. Henry crossed into Normandy in 1115 and assembled the Norman barons to swear loyalty; he also almost successfully negotiated a settlement with King Louis, affirming William's right to the Duchy in exchange for a large sum of money, but the deal fell through and Louis, backed by his ally Baldwin of Flanders, instead declared that he considered William Clito the legitimate heir to the Duchy.|$|E
5|$|Constance {{was given}} in {{marriage}} to Raymond of Poitiers in 1136. During the subsequent years, Raymond ruled Antioch while Constance gave birth to four children. After Raymond was murdered after a battle in 1149, Fulk of Anjou's son, Baldwin III of Jerusalem, assumed the regency. He tried to persuade Constance to remarry, {{but she did not}} <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> candidates. She also refused to marry a middle-aged relative of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenus. Finally, she found a love interest and was married to Raynald of Châtillon, a knight from France, in 1153.|$|E

5|$|Constantine {{grew up in}} an old priory in the Leicestershire {{village of}} Knipton and went hunting from the age of seven. She had a close {{relationship}} with her sister Annette Constantine and her father, Joseph Constantine, who was successful in the property and shipping sectors, was an Old Etonian pupil and served in the Coldstream Guards. When she was young, Constantine would rely on her father for fashion advice and has commented that any style that she has, she learned from him. He was a talented artist and was offered worldwide art exhibitions, although he was too modest to <b>accept.</b> <b>His</b> death came suddenly and was a milestone for Constantine.|$|E
5|$|In Karhide, {{the king}} is {{reluctant}} to <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> diplomatic mission. In Orgoreyn, Ai is seemingly accepted more easily by the political leaders, yet Ai is arrested, stripped of his clothes, drugged, and sent to a work camp. Rescued by Estraven, the deposed Prime Minister of Karhide, Genly realizes that cultural differences—specifically shifgrethor, gender roles and Gethenian sexuality—had kept him from understanding their relationship previously. During their 80-day journey across the frozen land to return to Karhide, Ai learns to understand and love Estraven.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{was also}} {{unable to stop}} those who came to hear him speak from desecrating the Sabbath, and his Yiddish sermons had {{no impact on the}} younger generation. In addition, he had to contend with a number of obstacles: he had no {{administrative}} experience or training, local Orthodox rabbis (particularly Joshua Seigel) and Jews outside his congregation did not <b>accept</b> <b>his</b> authority, and non-Orthodox Jews and groups criticized him. These problems were exacerbated by a stroke suffered in 1895, which partially incapacitated him, followed by a relapse in 1900 which left him bedridden.|$|E
