We have used <b>antisense</b> RNA and <b>DNA</b> <b>molecules</b> targeted against CA II, and against 16 - and 60 -kD subunits of vacuolar H(+) -ATPase (V-ATPase), to block the expression of these proteins in vitro. Osteoclastic bone resorption was studied in two in vitro culture systems: release of 45 Calcium from prelabeled newborn mouse calvaria cultures, and resorption pit assays performed with rat osteoclasts cultured on bovine bone slices. Both <b>antisense</b> RNA and <b>DNA</b> against CA II and the V-ATPase were used to compare their specificities as regards inhibiting bone resorption in vitro. The antisense molecules inhibited the synthesis of these proteins by decreasing the amounts of mRNA in the cells in a highly specific manner. In osteoclast cultures treated with the 16 -kD V-ATPase antisense RNA, acidification of an unknown population of intracellular vesicles was highly stimulated. The acidification of these vesicles was not sensitive to amiloride or bafilomycin A 1. This suggests {{the existence of a}} back-up system for acidification of intracellular vesicles, when the expression of the V-ATPase is blocked.

30|$|Viable {{bacterial}} cells impaled with {{a single}} particle of a nano-sized acicular material formed when a mixture containing the cells and the material was exposed to a sliding friction field between polystyrene and agar gel; hereafter, we refer to these impaled cells as penetrons. We have used nano-sized acicular material to establish a novel method for bacterial transformation. Here, we generated penetrons that carried <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> adsorbed on nano-sized acicular material (α-sepiolite) by providing sliding friction {{onto the surface of}} agar gel; we then investigated whether penetron formation was applicable to gene silencing techniques. <b>Antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> was artificially synthesized as 15 or 90 mer DNA oligonucleotides based on the sequences around the translation start codon of target mRNAs. Mixtures of bacterial cells with <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> adsorbed on α-sepiolite were stimulated by sliding friction on the surface of agar gel for 60 s. Upon formation of Escherichia coli penetrons, β-lactamase and β-galactosidase expression was evaluated by counting the numbers of colonies formed on LB agar containing ampicillin and by measuring β-galactosidase activity respectively. The numbers of ampicillin resistant colonies and the β-galactosidase activity derived from penetrons bearing <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> (90 mer) was repressed to 15 % and 25 %, respectively, of that of control penetrons which lacked <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA.</b> Biphenyl metabolite, ring cleavage yellow compound produced by Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes penetron treated with <b>antisense</b> oligonucleotide <b>DNA</b> targeted to bphD increased higher than that lacking <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA.</b> This result indicated that expression of bphD in P. pseudoalcaligenes penetrons was repressed by <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> that targeted bphD mRNA. Sporulation rates of Bacillus subtilis penetrons treated with <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> (15 mer) targeted to spo 0 A decreased to 24.4 % relative to penetrons lacking <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA.</b> This novel method of gene silencing has substantial promise for elucidation of gene function in bacterial species that have been refractory to experimental introduction of exogenous DNA.|$|R
40|$|The {{continued}} {{development of}} antisense targeting {{will require a}} better understanding of the mechanism. METHODS: We performed initial studies of the mechanism of intracellular antisense targeting through measurements of in situ transcription, immunofluorescence, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 32 P-labeled uridine- 52 ̆ 7 -triphosphate (alpha- 32 P-UTP) incorporation, nuclear accumulations of 99 mTc-labeled DNAs, and messenger RNA (mRNA) transcription rate. As reported earlier, an <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> against the mdr 1 mRNA coding for P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and its sense DNA control were used in KB-G 2 (Pgp++) cells. RESULTS: Definitive evidence for antisense targeting was obtained by in situ transcription showing complementary DNA elongation in cells exposed to <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA,</b> acting therefore as an intracellular PCR primer of mdr 1 mRNA, but not in cells exposed to sense DNA. Immunofluorescence staining showed higher accumulations of <b>antisense</b> versus sense <b>DNAs</b> in KB-G 2 cells. Transnuclear migration was confirmed by higher accumulations in the nucleus compared with the cytoplasm in cells incubated with 99 mTc-labeled <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA.</b> However, the observed specific accumulations of <b>antisense</b> <b>DNAs</b> of about 10 (6) per cell over 10 h could not be explained by a feedback mechanism upregulating transcription in cells exposed to <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> as no increase in mRNA levels was detected by both RT-PCR and 32 P-UTP in these cells. To explore an alternative hypothesis, a novel approach using 99 mTc-labeled <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> as a probe of total mRNA from cells previously saturated with unlabeled <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> was used to estimate the transcription rate. Compared with controls, mdr 1 mRNA levels were found to be initially low after saturation and to recover at about 2, 000 copies per minute per cell. If persistent, this transcription rate would provide 10 (6) mRNAs in 10 h. CONCLUSION: The results of all studies are consistent with antisense as the mechanism of targeting. Though a feedback mechanism leading to upregulation of mRNA transcription is an unlikely explanation for the high specific accumulations, our results may be explained if <b>antisense</b> <b>DNAs</b> are targeting mdr 1 mRNAs produced at high transcription rates. If the target is primarily pre-mRNA in the nucleus rather than mature mRNA in the cytoplasm, this would provide as well an explanation for the observed migration of 99 mTc-labeled <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> into the nucleus...|$|R
30|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that the effects on gene silencing caused by the <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> and nano-sized acicular materials were transient, thus this method affected only resting cells. In these experiments, we used <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> oligonucleotides that were chemically stable and reasonable to synthesize. Many published results demonstrate that the length of antisense oligonucleotides that are effective for gene silencing ranges from 15 to 25 residues (Uhlmann and Peyman [1990]; Mizuta et al. [1999]). The <b>antisense</b> <b>DNAs</b> with sequences complementary to sequences around the target AUG translation initiation codon should provide favorable results for gene silencing. A mechanism by which <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> oligonucleotides are released from α-sepiolite was proposed previously (Yoshida and Ide [2008]). Our novel gene silencing method described in this paper was more effective with Gram-negative bacteria than Gram-positive bacteria. We suspect that Gram-positive penetrons were harder to generate than Gram-negative penetrons because the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria is thicker than that of Gram-negative bacteria. Until now, researchers have used E. coli mutants with increased permeability properties to introduce <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> oligonucleotides when evaluating the gene silencing effects of <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> (Jayaraman et al. [1981]). The advantage of penetron technology for gene silencing is that the technique is simple and applicable to different bacterial species, and many such species {{have been unable to}} directly uptake oligonucleotide DNA until now. Once the experimental protocol is established for many bacterial species, the proposed gene silencing technique will be a powerful tool for the elucidation of physiological functions of biological molecules. In any case, our findings demonstrated the substantial potential of <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> as a new class of gene silencing molecules for not only bacteriology but also molecular biology, physiology, developmental biology involving clinical research.|$|R

We used Escherichia coli JM 109 harboring pUC 18 DNA and Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF 707 to represent Gram-negative bacteria. We synthesized 15 and 90 mer <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> oligonucleotides; each was targeted to the translation start codon of β−galactosidase α-fragment gene or β−lactamase gene coded in pUC 18 DNA. Silencing of the β−galactosidase α-fragment was evaluated by measurement of enzyme activity; silencing of β−lactamase was evaluated by numerical comparisons of ampicillin resistant colonies. Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF 707 was isolated by Furukawa and Miyazaki ([1986]) as a biphenyl degrading bacterium (1986). The genes associated with biphenyl metabolism and their functions are well studied (Furukawa and Miyazaki [1986]; Furukawa and Arimura, [1987]; Taira et al. [1992]). We synthesized 15 and 90 mer <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> oligonucleotides; each was targeted to the 2 -hydroxy- 6 -oxo- 6 -phenylhexa- 2, 4 -dienoate hydrolase gene (bphD).

A second objective was to establish to a reasonable extent whether cellular accumulation of radiolabeled oligonucleotides can be explained by an antisense mechanism. METHODS: An 18 mer uniform phosphorothioate <b>DNA</b> <b>antisense</b> to the messenger RNA (mRNA) of the type I regulatory subunit alpha of cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase A (RI alpha) was conjugated with the N-hydroxysuccinimidyl derivative of S-acetylmercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG 3) through a primary amine/linker and investigated in vitro in cell culture. RESULTS: By surface plasmon resonance, the association kinetics between native (i. e., without amine/linker) DNA and MAG 3 -amide/linker-DNA were identical. Melting temperatures were also identical for native DNA, amine/linker-DNA, and MAG 3 -amide/linker-DNA, indicating that these chemical modifications had no detectable influence on hybridization. However, cellular accumulation of (99 m) Tc-MAG 3 -DNA was lower than that of (35) S-MAG 3 -DNA, suggesting that chemical modifications can have an important influence on cellular accumulation. In tissue culture studies of ACHN tumor cells (a human renal adenocarcinoma cell type), an antisense effect was suggested by 3 findings: an increased accumulation of (35) S- or (99 m) Tc-labeled <b>antisense</b> versus sense <b>DNA,</b> an increased accumulation of (99 m) Tc-antisense DNA in another RI alpha-positive tumor cell line (LS 174 T) but not in a murine transfected control cell line (HC- 2), and the disappearance of the increased cellular accumulation of (99 m) Tc-antisense DNA with increasing dosage of <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA.</b> Higher than expected cellular accumulations of about 10 (5) <b>antisense</b> <b>DNAs</b> per cell over 24 h suggest stabilization of the target mRNA or increased mRNA production by the presence of the <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA.</b> In support of this suggestion, we observed, first, an increased incorporation of uridine- 52 ̆ 7 -triphosphate into RNA in cells exposed to the <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> but not to the control DNA and, second, an increase in target mRNA expression in cells exposed to the <b>antisense</b> <b>DNA</b> but not to the control DNA.
