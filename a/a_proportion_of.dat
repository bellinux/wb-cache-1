5|$|Australia's defence {{expenditure}} {{is much larger}} in dollar terms to that of most countries in Australia's region. The share of GDP Australia spends on defence is also larger than that in most developed economies and major South-East Asian countries. China spends somewhat more on defence as <b>a</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> GDP than Australia does, and has been rapidly increasing its expenditure. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute has estimated that Australia's defence spending in 2015 was the 13th highest of any country in real terms. As <b>a</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> GDP Australia's defence spending ranks as 49th of the countries for which data is available.|$|E
5|$|HeliumII is a superfluid, {{a quantum}} {{mechanical}} state (see: macroscopic quantum phenomena) of matter with strange properties. For example, when it flows through capillaries {{as thin as}} 10−7 to 10−8m it has no measurable viscosity. However, when measurements were done between two moving discs, a viscosity {{comparable to that of}} gaseous helium was observed. Current theory explains this using the two-fluid model for helium II. In this model, liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing <b>a</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> helium atoms in a ground state, which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero viscosity, and <b>a</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> helium atoms in an excited state, which behave more like an ordinary fluid.|$|E

5|$|A {{traditional}} {{thesis is}} that cavalry assumed {{a much greater}} importance in the 4th-century army than it enjoyed in the 2nd century. According to this view, cavalry increased significantly as <b>a</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> the total forces and took over the leading tactical role from the infantry. It also enjoyed much higher status than in the 2nd century. At the same time, the infantry declined in efficiency and value in operations, leaving the cavalry as the effective arm.

5|$|The annual {{incidence}} is about 1.1 per 100,000 annually in population studies from the United States and France.

Similarly, those living in urban areas are more likely to receive appropriate investigations, accounting for increased rates of diagnosis in those dwelling in cities.

5|$|Agriculture in Wales has in {{the past}} been {{a major part of the}} economy of Wales, a largely rural country that forms part of the United Kingdom.

As <b>a</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> the national economy, the importance of agriculture has become much reduced; a high proportion of the population now live in the towns and cities in the south of the country and tourism has become an important form of income in the countryside and on the coast.

5|$|During the {{reproductive}} season, males {{of this and}} other fairywren species pluck yellow petals, which contrast with their plumage, and show them to female fairywrens. The petals often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a female in the male fairywren's own or another territory. Males sometimes show petals to females in other territories even outside the breeding season, presumably to promote themselves. Fairywrens are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous: pairs will bond for life, though {{both males and females}} will regularly mate with other individuals; <b>a</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> young will have been fathered by males from outside the group. Young are often raised not by the pair alone, but with other males who also mated with the pair's female assisting.|$|E
5|$|Given that liver AVMs {{generally}} cause high-output cardiac failure, {{the emphasis}} is on treating this with diuretics to reduce the circulating blood volume, restriction of salt and fluid intake, and antiarrhythmic agents in case of irregular heart beat. This may be sufficient in treating the symptoms of swelling and breathlessness. If this treatment is not effective or leads to side effects or complications, the only remaining option is liver transplantation. This is reserved for those with severe symptoms, as it carries a mortality of about 10%, but leads to good results if successful. The exact point at which liver transplantion is to be offered is not yet completely established. Embolization treatment has been attempted, but leads to severe complications in <b>a</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> patients and is discouraged.|$|E

In February 2011, Gillard announced extensive revision of the original health funding reforms proposed by the Rudd Government, which had been unable to secure the support of all state governments. The revised Gillard government plan proposed that the federal government move towards providing 50% of new health funding (and not 60 per cent as originally agreed) and removed the requirement of the states to cede <b>a</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> their GST revenue to the Federal Government in order to fund the new arrangement.
