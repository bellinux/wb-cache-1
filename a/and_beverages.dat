There are only four kitchen chefs and two cook helpers in this division. Because there are many activities in the Food <b>and</b> <b>Beverage</b> product, it will be better for Food <b>and</b> <b>Beverage</b> department to add more kitchen chef and cook helper. Food <b>and</b> <b>Beverage</b> product should also try to make new variety of menu in order to attract more customers...|$|R

5|$|From the 1840s, {{the city}} enjoyed {{a period of}} rapid {{expansion}} beyond its traditional boundaries, becoming Denmark's second largest city. The city gates were demolished in 1851 and soon afterwards development extended to the area south of the river. Glove production, which had begun in the 18th century, developed {{into one of the}} most important industries while the harbour facilities were further expanded. In 1853 Denmark's first modern water and gas works were opened in Odense. Commerce was further boosted by the building of a railway across Funen in 1865, and Odense became one of Denmark's largest rail junctions. All this provided an ideal basis for industrialisation, attracting a wide range of industries including iron and metals, textiles, and food <b>and</b> <b>beverages.</b> Separate areas of the city were devoted to increased industrial and residential expansion, and the population of the city began to grow markedly; by 1900 it had 35,000 inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Some Muslims, {{especially}} those living near the southern coast, took {{the option of}} exile, but for most, publicly converting to Christianity while secretly continuing to believe and practise Islam was the only available option for surviving as Muslims. The population converted en masse, and by 1501 the entire Muslim population of Granada was nominally converted to Christianity. The apparent success of Granada's forced conversions triggered a series of edicts and proclamations in 1501 and 1502 which effectively put the Muslims elsewhere in Castile to the same fate. These new converts, along with their descendants, were known by Spanish sources as the Moriscos. As well as having to accept Christianity and abandon the Islamic faith and rituals, they were also pressured to conform to Christian ways, including by attending church, sending their children to be instructed in the Christian doctrine, and partaking of food <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> forbidden by Islamic law.|$|E

40|$|This {{second edition}} of the best selling {{textbook}} Food <b>and</b> <b>Beverage</b> Management has been updated and revised {{to take account of}} current trends within the hospitality industry. In particular the consideration of food <b>and</b> <b>beverage</b> (or foodservice) operations is clearly set within a broader business framework with more consideration being given to the management of foodservice operations within a changing business environment. The underlying thinking behind much of this text relies on the application of a systems approach to the management of operations. The text therefore proposes systematic approaches to the design, planning and control of food <b>and</b> <b>beverage</b> operations, <b>and</b> also recognises the need to manage operations as operating systems. The book considers a food <b>and</b> <b>beverage</b> operation as comprising three distinct but interlinked systems: food production, food <b>and</b> <b>beverage</b> service as a delivery system <b>and</b> food <b>and</b> <b>beverage</b> service as a customer process system. The component parts of the three systems are examined, as well as the linkages between them, and how these together create a food <b>and</b> <b>beverage</b> operation...|$|R

At the supporter centre, fans can buy souvenirs, and tickets to away matches. The square also contains publicly accessible benches and tables. Access between the {{different areas of the}} stadium was limited by a system of security gates {{until the end of the}} 2011 season, when Malmö FF announced that supporters would be able to roam the stadium freely, except for the areas occupied by away supporters. This was done to create a more free and friendly atmosphere, and to encourage fans to arrive earlier for matches. To further motivate spectators to come early, pre-match activities are often held at Ståplatstorget.|$|E
5|$|When the {{predecessor}} of international fast food restaurant chain Burger King (BK) first opened in 1953, its menu predominantly consisted of hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks, milkshakes, and desserts. After being acquired by its Miami, Florida franchisees and renamed in 1954, BK began expanding its menu {{by adding the}} Whopper sandwich in 1957, and has since added non-beef items such as chicken, fish, and vegetarian offerings, including salads and meatless sandwiches. Other additions include a breakfast menu <b>and</b> <b>beverages</b> such as Icees, juices, and bottled waters. As the company expanded {{both inside and outside}} the United States, it introduced localized versions of its products that conform to regional tastes and cultural or religious beliefs. To generate additional sales, BK occasionally introduces limited-time offers of special versions of its products, or brings out completely new products intended for either long- or short-term sales. Not all of these products and services have been successful; in 1992, Burger King introduced limited table service featuring special dinner platters, but this concept failed to generate interest and was discontinued.|$|E
