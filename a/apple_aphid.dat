40|$|ReportThis {{study showed}} that {{resistance}} to organophosphates remained relatively stable in the field populations of OBLR during the 3 years of the study, {{despite the absence of}} sprays of these materials. The control of OBLR in the soft pesticide programs was generally better than that obtained by growers in their standard pesticide treatments. However, adequate control of plum curculio was not obtained in most of the blocks {{and at the end of}} the study, damage was observed even in blocks that were completely free of this pest during the first season. These results showed that adequate control of the curculio cannot be maintained for multiple seasons without using special control sprays even in blocks that would not be considered to be at risk from this pest.

40|$|Abstract Background Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) are a {{class of}} small, non-coding RNAs that play an {{important}} role in development and environmental responses. Hundreds of plant miRNAs have been identified to date, mainly from the model species for which there are available genome sequences. The current challenge is to characterise miRNAs from plant species with agricultural and horticultural importance, to aid our understanding of important regulatory mechanisms in crop species and enable improvement of crops and rootstocks. Results Based on the knowledge that many miRNAs occur in large gene families and are highly conserved among distantly related species, we analysed expression of twenty-one miRNA sequences in different tissues of apple (Malus x domestica 'Royal Gala'). We identified eighteen sequences that are expressed in at least one of the tissues tested. Some, but not all, miRNAs expressed in apple tissues including the phloem tissue were also detected in the phloem sap sample derived from the stylets of woolly <b>apple</b> <b>aphids.</b> Most of the miRNAs detected in apple phloem sap were also abundant in the phloem sap of herbaceous species. Potential targets for apple miRNAs were identified that encode putative proteins shown to be targets of corresponding miRNAs in a number of plant species. Expression patterns of potential targets were analysed and correlated with expression of corresponding miRNAs. Conclusions This study validated tissue-specific expression of apple miRNAs that target genes responsible for plant growth, development, and stress response. A subset of characterised miRNAs was also present in the apple phloem translocation stream. A comparative analysis of phloem miRNAs in herbaceous species and woody perennials will aid our understanding of non-cell autonomous roles of miRNAs in plants. </p...|$|R

The aphid has displaced the native species Aphis pomi DeGeer in some regions of the country. Its development, from newborn nymph to adult female takes, in laboratory conditions, 9 – 10 days at 22 – 24 °C or 6 – 7 days at 28 – 30 °C. The average fecundity of one female at both temperatures is 9. 5 – 10. 5 nymphs. Under field conditions, in May and July of 2007 and 2008, the full development lasted 8. 1 – 8. 6 days of average, and the average fecundity of one female was 20. 7 – 21. 2 nymphs.

50|$|In {{the case}} of apples, in which {{research}} is being carried out {{in order to develop}} resistance to diseases such as apple scab (Venturia inaequalis), powdery mildew (Podosphaera leucotricha), orchard fireblight (Erwinia amylovora), woolly <b>apple</b> <b>aphid</b> (Eriosoma lanigerum) and collar rot (Phytophthora cactorum), the main sources of resistant material used in breeding programmes such as those being run by East Malling Research Station in England or Hortresearch in New Zealand are major gene resistances derived from crab-apples. The Vf gene for black spot resistance is derived from the ornamental crab-apple species Malus floribunda. Most black spot resistant cultivars developed around the world carry this gene, but there are some selections that carry the Vr (from M. pumila) or Vm (from M. micromalus) gene. Major gene resistances to powdery mildew are derived from M. robusta (Pl1) and M. zumi (Pl2), and the apple cultivar Northern Spy has a long-standing reputation for its major gene resistance to woolly <b>apple</b> <b>aphid.</b> Since early this century this resistance has been used to develop woolly aphid resistant rootstocks such as MM.106 and M.793.

5000|$|Eriosoma lanigerum infestations have {{increased}} in the North-western United States as apple growers have reduced the use of organophosphate pesticides, it is though {{that the use of}} these chemicals to control the codling moth in orchards also repressed the infestation by the aphids. The chalcid wasp Aphelinus mali is used as a biological control and this wasp has been deliberately or accidentally introduced into most regions where the woolly <b>apple</b> <b>aphid</b> occurs. When they have been parasitised by the wasps the aphids cease wax production and turn black in colour. Sometimes it is possible to see a circular hole on the upper surface of the aphid which the adult wasp created when it emerged from the body of its host. [...] Rootstocks have been developed which convey resistance to the aphids to the roots but they {{do not appear to be}} effective against aerial infestation. Growers have also tried to prevent nfestation by preventing the crawler stage of the nymph from climbing into the crown but these have proven ineffective as aphids can colonise the crown from neighbouring trees. As well as the parasitoid, Alphelinus mali, these aphids are preyed on by the bug Anthocoris nemoralis, ladybirds, hoverfly larvae and lacewings. The presence of earwigs Forficula auricularia on the tress can reduce the levels of aphid infestation, so encouraging these insects by providing shelters may be another means of biological control. Exclsuion experiments in Poland showed that the earwigs, and to a lesser extent the seven-spot ladybird Coccinella septempunctata were important in controlling the numbers of aphids later in the season while in the early Spring the pine ladybird Exochomus quadripustulatus was the main predator on the aphids. The hoverflies, Heringia calcarata and Eupeodes americana, have also been used as effective biological control organisms. Areopraon lepelleyi is another species of wasp which is a parasitoid of the woolly <b>apple</b> <b>aphid.</b> In addition, entomopathogenic nematodes have been used to control root-dwelling populations of E. lanigerum.|$|E
40|$|The <b>apple</b> rosy <b>aphid,</b> Dysaphis plantaginea (Passerini), is {{a serious}} pest in pome orchards. Insecticide {{applications}} of to reduce damages are usually a need and are based on pre- and / or post-flowering treatments. The secondary host of this aphid has no agricultural interest so, differently from other species like Myzus persicae (Sulzer) and Aphis gossypii Glover the summer generations are not treated. This lower selection pressure is certainly {{the main reason for}} the quite rare reports of resistance in D. plantaginea. However, following specific control failure reports, it was considered wise to make a preliminary survey on the activity of enzymatic systems of D. plantaginea, that in other aphid species are known to be involved in insecticide resistance. In spring 2008 two populations of D. plantaginea were collected: the first in a commercial orchard with insecticide control failures, the second from an apple tree in an untreated garden far away from commercial fruit orchards. Spectrophotometric and fluorimetric techniques have been used to measure the activity of the following enzymatic systems: esterases, glutathione S-transferases, monooxygenases and acetylcholinesterases. Preliminary results indicate that between the two populations: • there are no significant differences in the activity total esterase; • also the activity of glutathione S-transferase is very similar; • acetylcholinesterase is inhibited equally {{in the presence of a}} dimethycarmabate diagnostic concentration that in M. persicae can distinguish among resistant than sensitive specimens; • there are differences in monooxygenase activity: such activity is higher in the specimens from the population that survived the treatments.

Further investigations will be needed to clarify the role played by monooxygenases in the sporadic cases reported of treatment efficacy reductio...|$|R
40|$|A survey {{has been}} carried out in two {{experimental}} organic orchards located at the INRA experimental station of Gotheron near Valence (Southeastern France). The program also associated the GRAB (Groupe de Recherche en Agriculture Biologique, Avignon). The aims were:(i) to acquire references about peach and apple organic farming; (ii) to improve the management of organic orchards by integrating some results of previous research; and (iii) to measure on the long term the effect of organic farming on the soil and on the arthropod community of the orchard. Soils were shallow and washed out stone soils presenting low pH, low organic matter content and low CEC (Cationic Exchange Capacity). Both orchards had been organically managed since planting, realised in 1994 for the apple orchard (Smoothee 2832 T(r) cultivar), and in 1999 for the peach orchard (Bénédicte(r) cultivar). Several parameters measuring the growth of the trees, the yield and the fruit quality were monitored. The low ability of the soil to store and supply nutrients to fulfill the tree requirements implied: (i) to use appropriate types of fertilizers, such as compost in autumn, with additional organic fertilizers which quickly mineralized in spring; (ii) to decrease the dose of fertilizers increasing therefore the number of doses; and (iii) to make additional sprays with oligoelements (Mn, B) in apple orchard. This strategy allowed to increase the pH, to improve the organic matter soil content and to preserve or to increase the availability of the soil nutrients. PEACH ORCHARD The yield was balanced at about 20 tons per ha with a high fruit quality (high sugar content, well balanced sugar/acidity ratio), that was favoured by a water supply restriction during the fruit first growth stages. Most probably because of a well-balanced nutrition and because of a non-disruptive pest management, aphids did not cause any damages: the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) was very seldom monitored and Brachycaudus persicae did not affect seriously the trees. Most of all other pests were under control, using mating disruption against the oriental moth (Cydia molesta), sulphur against powdery mildew and mineral oils in winter against wintering arthropods. The main worrying pest was leaf curl due to Taphrina deformans. With a susceptible period lasting 6 to 7 weeks in winter, and a control of this desease relying on the use of copper, the total amount of this compound sprayed in one year can be high, unless the cultivar is not highly susceptible. APPLE ORCHARD The yield has increased regularly since planting until 2000. In 2001, the decrease in yield was most probably related to aphid infestation in 2000, which is lileky to have induced biennal bearing.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 A {{method of}} culturing Eriosoma pyricola on {{detached}} root pieces {{was developed to}} ensure a regular supply of aphids for experimental work. Another method was designed for studying the alate sexuparae formation in woolly pear aphid, whereby growing plants were infested so that the aphids or their progeny could be recovered later. Sexuparae were produced in woolly pear aphid colonies on the roots of "Domestic Bartlett" seedlings treated to induce dormancy, indicating E. pyricola is holocyclic in Oregon. No sexuparae were found while shoot growth continued. Shoot growth of pear seedlings ceased when the plants were exposed to 10 -hour photoperiods at a constant 24 °C. Growth continued for a much longer time when plants were kept under 16 -hour photoperiods at alternating day and night temperatures, 24 °C and 18 °C, respectively. However, aphids did not produce sexuparae when cultured on detached root pieces from plants treated for four weeks under 10 -hour photoperiods at a constant 24 °C. Also, sexuparae were not found in aphid colonies on root pieces of dormant plants from the field. All these results agree with our field observations. In the field, sexuparae are produced for about two months in late summer and early fall on the roots of infested plants. After this, no more sexuparae appear in the remaining aphid populations which continue as apterous virginoparae on pear roots until autumn of the following year. Experiments on growth cessation in pear plants indicated that short day-length was not the critical factor responsible for the induction of growth cessation in pear seedlings. These experiments also showed that constant temperatures were {{more important in the}} regulation of growth in this pear variety. The direct effect of photoperiods and temperatures on sexuparae production in this aphid was also investigated. Aphids on detached root pieces did not produce sexuparae when exposed to 10 -hour photo-periods at alternating day and night temperatures, 24 °C and 18 °C, respectively. Aphid cultures on detached root pieces were kept under different combinations of 10 - and 16 -hour photoperiods and 15 ° and 18 °C constant temperatures. But the treatments had no effect on sexuparae formation. No sexuparae were found in aphid colonies on root pieces kept in continuous darkness at constant temperatures of 15 °, 18 °, 21 °, 24 ° and 27 °C for periods of 14 to 49 days. Also, sexuparae were not produced when aphid cultures on root pieces were alternated between 15 ° and 24 °C every 12 hours for 47 days. Sexuparae were not found in our stock cultures maintained at 21 °C for about three years. Direct effect of different temperatures on the development and increase in numbers of woolly pear aphid was also studied. Apterous E. pyricola on detached roots developed and reproduced normally at 24 °C, but failed to reproduce and died within two weeks when kept at 27 °C.

50|$|The {{adults of}} Eriosoma lanigerum are small to medium sized aphids, up to 2mm long, {{and have an}} {{elliptical}} shape, are reddish brown to purple in colour but the colour is normally hidden by the white cotton-like secretion from the specialised glands in the aphid's abdomen which gives it the common name of woolly <b>apple</b> <b>aphid.</b> The wax is produced after each moult so newly moulted individuals lack the wax coating, {{the main purpose of}} which is thought to be to prevent the honeydew secreted by the aphids to contaminate them but it may also produce a shelter from the weather and from parasites and predators.

40|$|Yellow dwarf {{of onions}} is a {{transmissible}} virus disease, of the mosaic group. The virus overwinters in the infected onion bulbs and in volunteer onion plants that live over {{winter in the}} fields. It probably is neither seed nor soil borne. Yellow dwarf symptoms are characterized by yellowing and crinkling of the leaves, which become more or less flat and droop over in the advanced stages. Flower stalks of infected mother on ion plants become yellow, twist, and curl and are shorter than normal plants. Masking of yellow dwarf symptoms occurs quite commonly in infected onion plants, and these plants {{are a source of}} inoculum for infecting healthy plants; bulbs from the plants masking symptoms when regrown produce infected plants that show disease symptoms. Plants grown from infected onion sets and those that become infected early in the growing season produce under-developed bulbs of little commercial value. Onion plants having masked infection throughout their growth period produce apparently normal plants and yields. Infected mother onion plants produce normal seed, but the seed yield is about 30 percent less than from healthy plants. Yellow Dwarf is transmissible by artificial inoculation and insect vectors. By artificial inoculations the incubation period is usually about 10 days. Onion bulbs hypodermically inoculated with juice extracted from the fleshy and dry scale leaves of infected onion bulbs failed to show infection. Inoculations made during retarded growth periods either fail to infect the plants or the symptoms are not manifested during the current growth period. Signs of the disease appear when the bulbs of such infected plants are regrown. The virus extracted from yellow dwarf infected onion leaves that mask the symptoms is infective. Yellow dwarf virus was transmitted under controlled conditions by the bean aphid (Aphis rumiscis Linn.), corn leaf aphid (Aphis maidis Fitch.), and the <b>apple</b> grain <b>aphid</b> (Rhopalosiphum prunifoliae Fitch). The yellow dwarf virus was inactivated when the viriferous juice was stored in vitro at 29 ° C. for a period of 112 hours. When infected onion leaves were stored in the open, at 29 ° C. for 100 hours, juice extracted from the leaves was non-infective. The infectivity of the virus was only slightly retarded when viriferous juice was heated 10 minutes at 70 ° C. At 75 ° C. for 10 minutes, 55 percent of the original virulence of the virus was lost. At 80 ° C. for 10 minutes, the virus was inactivated. With 10 -minute exposures the critical thermal point for the yellow dwarf virus lies between 75 and 80 ° C. Exposures as low as - 14 ° C. for 6 hours failed to inactivate yellow dwarf virus. Inoculations with dilutions of 1 - 10, 240 and above failed to infect any of the onion plants. Yellow dwarf virus inoculated into Chinese sacred lily (Narcissus tazetta L.) bulbs, Jonquil (Narcissus jonquilla L.) bulbs and shallots (Allium sativum L.) visibly infected 60, 30 and 90 percent of the plants, respectively. Inoculations with other plant viruses, including mosaic of Chinese sacred lily (Narcissus tazetta L.) and Jonquil (Narcissus jonquilla L.) failed to infect onion plants. Only one (Riverside Sweet Spanish) of thirty-six onion varieties tested seemed to be markedly resistant. The combined effect of indexing all growing stocks of onion bulbs, producing the planting stock of bulbs in areas free from yellow dwarf and roguing out the infected volunteer onions in the fields reduced the percentage of yellow dwarf infection in the district from 40 percent in 1928 to a trace in 1933 and 1934...|$|R

40|$|A {{sampling}} system {{was developed for}} monitoring population levels of woolly <b>apple</b> <b>aphid,</b> Eriosoma lanigerum (Hausmann), by counting colonies on half of each of 25 apple trees per 2 ha block. Sampling error was affected by whether the colonies were found in wounds or in leaf axils. Parasitism of colonies in leaf axils had a slight effect on sampling error. Sampling error for colonies in leaf axils was high at just over 40 %. However, decisions regarding intervention were not markedly compromised by simply classifying the 25 trees as infested or uninfested, as opposed to counting colonies in leaf axils. The presence-absence system greatly reduced the time spent monitoring E. lanigerum population levels, making it an attractive system for assessing woolly <b>apple</b> <b>aphid</b> infestations in commercial orchards.
