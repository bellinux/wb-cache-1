40|$|Work motives, {{work values}} and work orientations are {{concepts}} that seem closely connected. In order to test these concepts and their possible overlap a survey has been organized. Because {{of a research}} interest in the non-profit sector, a survey was held with newly graduates in teacher education of who were 179 employed as teachers and 43 persons working elsewhere (non-teachers). The questionnaire consisted of different parts: 35 questions about the initial motives to become a teacher, derived from a previous study in non-profit secondary schools, a shortened Dutch version on work values (De Vos, 2002) and a measure following De Witte (1990) for work orientations. The group of teachers and non-teachers were compared. As expected and confirmed (Matheus et al., 2002; Dierynck et al., 1998), teachers attach high importance to the altruistic and social aspects of work, whereas non-teachers give more importance <b>to</b> <b>career,</b> <b>promotion</b> and individual growth aspects. Following Baele et al. (2002) teachers appear to target first of all holistic or altruistic values in their work, in contrast to non-teachers, who look mostly for individualistic values. Concerning the conceptual overlap, analyses on the data seem to indicate little discrimination between work orientations and work values. Further methodological and conceptual analyses seem required to test hypotheses about this overlap. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{review the}} {{principles}} underlying medical student selection {{from the perspective}} of the imperatives of widening access policies. Setting: A recent government initiative has increased the number of medical school places in Great Britain. A priority is to widen access to sections of the community hitherto inadequately represented in medical schools, including applicants from disadvantaged areas and lower socio-economic groups, in order that the social characteristics of the population of future doctors better reflects society as a whole. Outcome: An analysis of evidence upon which medical student selection policies and practice have evolved in order to i) provide guidelines to shape programmes aimed at raising <b>aspirations</b> <b>to</b> a <b>career</b> in medicine in target groups under-represented in medical schools; ii) establish a template for flexible and inclusive selection and admission policies; iii) increase the representation of students from diverse backgrounds.

40|$|The study {{examined}} the relationship between the secondary constructs of Holland’s (1997) theory of vocational interests and career choice readiness [career maturity] attitudes with 358 Swiss secondary students. The hypothesis was tested that the secondary constructs consistency, coherence, differentiation, and congruence are measures for the degree of vocational interest development. Thus, they should belong to the content domain in career choice readiness and should show meaningful relations <b>to</b> <b>career</b> choice readiness attitudes. The hypothesis was confirmed for congruence, coherence, and differentiation. Interest profile consistency showed no relation <b>to</b> <b>career</b> choice readiness attitudes. Vocational identity emerged as a direct measure for career choice readiness attitudes. Realism of <b>career</b> <b>aspirations</b> was related <b>to</b> <b>career</b> choice readiness attitudes and coherence of career aspirations.

40|$|The study investigates {{changes in}} Israeli {{accounting}} students' career aspirations during their course of studies, {{and the relationship}} between these and their perceptions of professional accountancy firms. We employed a cross-sectional analysis of students across consecutive educational levels from the first year to the end of their formal education. We assumed that revealed differences between the accounting student cohorts, in terms of their perceptions of professional accountancy firms and their career aspirations, could be interpreted as reflecting changes over time in students' attitudes. Results from the sample show that accounting student' <b>aspirations</b> <b>to</b> pursue a <b>career</b> with a professional accountancy firm decline significantly between the first and postgraduate years, while their desire to work in the business sector increases. The results show the same trend with regard to the student's positive perceptions of the above firms as future workplaces. Non-parametric tests demonstrate significant relationships between students' career aspirations and their perceptions of professional accountancy firms. We suggest that the change in students' perceptions and aspirations is a symptom of something similar to a 'reality shock', and that it results from the students' exposure to the accounting profession. Professional accountancy firms need to implement innovative policies to meet the challenge. Accounting education, career aspirations, perceptions, students, reality shock,...|$|R

40|$|This project {{examines}} why {{college women}} who pursued a science career {{for at least}} two years eventually changed their career aspirations. The current research evolves from a pilot study where college women considering careers in medicine used language which envisioned a future clash between the role of a physician and that of a mother. This idea of a clash of future selves is further studied in the project. College women who pursued science {{for at least two}} years before changing career goals (Switchers) were interviewed using a semi-structured interview protocol addressing such topics as experiences in science courses, science interests, supportive people, and personal aspirations. By contrast, college women still pursuing a science career in such areas as research science or medicine (Pursuers) were also interviewed. Results indicate that both Switchers and Pursuers used language of the self when discussing their career goals and when describing clashes they experienced when considering future science careers.
