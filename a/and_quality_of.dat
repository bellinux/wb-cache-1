5|$|Horses, {{particularly}} colts, {{sometimes are}} physically capable of reproduction at about 18months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed {{before the age}} of three, especially females. Horses four years old are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six; maturation also depends on the horse's size, breed, sex, <b>and</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> care. Larger horses have larger bones; therefore, not only do the bones take longer to form bone tissue, but the epiphyseal plates are larger and take longer to convert from cartilage to bone. These plates convert after the other parts of the bones, and are crucial to development.|$|E

The aim of this work was to literary review the effects that {{have an impact on the}} <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the colostrum <b>and</b> on the calves itselves during the colostrum nutrition and the lactic nutrition. Among the analyzed effects there were selected order of lactation, age at the first calving, level of productivity, season of born of the calf, length of the dry period and the process of bloody discharge. All the data used in this thesis was obtained from reports of registration of bovine animals and reports of productivity monitoring of the agricultural association Černovice from May 2013 to December 2014. The monitored group was made of 243 cows of Czech Pied cattle and 233 calves. The paper contains an evaluation <b>of</b> a <b>quality</b> (density) <b>of</b> the colostrum reviewed by order of lactation, age at the first calving, level of productivity, season of birth of the calf, length of the dry period, calving interval and bloody discharge, it also contains the correlations between lactation <b>and</b> the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the colostrum, the age at the first calving <b>and</b> the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the colostrum, level <b>of</b> productivity <b>and</b> the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the colostrum, the season of birth of the calf <b>and</b> the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the colostrum, the time of the dry period <b>and</b> the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the colostrum, the bloody discharge <b>and</b> the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the colostrum, the length of the interim period <b>and</b> the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the colostrum <b>and</b> the viability <b>of</b> calves <b>and</b> the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the colostrum...|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages the {{problems}} of schism in the Catholic Church allowed the Scottish Crown to gain greater influence over senior appointments and two archbishoprics had been established {{by the end of}} the fifteenth century. Historians have discerned a decline in traditional monastic life in the late Middle Ages, but the mendicant orders of friars grew, particularly in the expanding burghs, emphasised preaching and ministering to the population. New saints and cults of devotion also proliferated. Despite problems over the number <b>and</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> clergy after the Black Death in the fourteenth century, and evidence of heresy in the fifteenth century, the Church in Scotland remained stable before the Reformation in the sixteenth century.|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedThere {{appears to}} be a paradox in the {{prostate}} cancer literature: despite the fact that age and comorbidities are positively correlated, comorbidities are associated with worse physical <b>and</b> emotional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life while age is associated with worse physical <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life but better emotional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life. Emotional support and positive reframing coping strategies may help explain part of this paradox in that they may be more frequently used by older prostate cancer patients and associated with better emotional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life. In an effort to better understand this paradox, the present questionnaire-based study of pre-treatment prostate cancer patients (n= 74) investigated 1) the relations among age, comorbidity level, emotional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life, <b>and</b> physical <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life, 2) age as a potential moderator of the association between comorbidities <b>and</b> emotional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life, <b>and</b> 3) an age-specific coping strategy comprised of emotional support and positive reframing as a mediator of the age <b>and</b> emotional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life association. Results suggest that age is positively associated with emotional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life <b>and</b> comorbidity level is negatively associated with physical <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life. However, no significant relations were found between age <b>and</b> physical <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life or comorbidity level <b>and</b> emotional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life, nor was an interaction between age and comorbidity level in emotional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life confirmed. Age-specific coping strategies were not found to mediate the relation between age <b>and</b> emotional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life either, but statistical trends suggest that older patients may appraise their prostate cancer diagnoses as less distressing than their younger counterparts and therefore use fewer coping strategies in general.
