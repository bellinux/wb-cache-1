5|$|In Autumn La Fleche {{attempted}} {{to win a}} second Manchester Plate, but finished third to the three-year-colts Raeburn, and Isinglass. The race had been expected to lie between La Fleche and Isinglass, and their respective jockeys focused their attentions on each other, allowing Raeburn to emerge almost unseen to take the race in the closing stages. For this race, La Fleche carried <b>a</b> <b>weight</b> of 154 pounds. On 25 October she found <b>a</b> <b>weight</b> of 133 pound too much when finishing unplaced in the Cambridgeshire. She won the Lowther Stakes at Newmarket in October. On 10 November she ran in the Liverpool Autumn Cup, carrying <b>a</b> <b>weight</b> of 132 pounds and won in impressive style by one and a quarter lengths from The Prisoner. Later in November, she was beaten under 137 pounds in the Manchester November Handicap.|$|E

5|$|Following Against All Odds, Team 3D {{were forced}} to weigh in before each contest, which created a feud with the team of Curry Man and Shark Boy, leading to a Fish Market Street Fight between the two teams, with the {{stipulation}} that if Team 3D could not make weight they would be fired from TNA. At the event, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that if Team 3D made weight that night {{they would not have}} to abide by <b>a</b> <b>weight</b> restriction henceforth.

The Ohio Department of Transportation capped funding for maintaining the Fort Steuben Bridge in 1998 at around $200,000 (US$ with inflation) per year. The Fort Steuben Bridge was weight-restricted in 2006 due to the weakening of the structure over time.

5|$|January Jones became {{pregnant}} {{in between the}} fourth and fifth season of the series. Instead of writing in a pregnancy for the Betty Francis character, the writers opted to write in <b>a</b> <b>weight</b> gain. January Jones wore a fat suit during the filming of this episode, the same technique used by Elizabeth Moss during the first season when her character encountered a similar weight gain (though in that instance, the character was actually pregnant). Make-up tricks and clever camera angles were also used to create the dramatic impression of Betty's weight gain. A body double was used for the scene in which Betty rises from the bathtub.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after its}} opening, {{concerns}} were {{raised about the}} bridge's safety. Following an inspection by John Hawkshaw and Edwin Clark in 1861, an additional support chain was added on each side. Despite the strengthening there were still concerns about its soundness, and <b>a</b> <b>weight</b> limit of 5 tons was imposed. At the same time, the name was changed from Victoria Bridge to Chelsea Bridge, as the government {{was concerned about the}} reliability of suspension bridges and did not want a potential collapse {{to be associated with the}} Queen.|$|E

He made little show in the race and finished unplaced behind Stone Clink. Two days later, St. Gatien was given a chance to redeem his reputation when he met Stone Clink again in Her Majesty's Plate over two miles. This race was at level weights and St. Gatien had no difficulty justifying his position as 4/9 favourite, taking the lead a furlong from the finish and winning very easily by three lengths.|$|E
5|$|The 5.7×28mm SS90 {{cartridge}} was discontinued, and replaced, in 1993, {{with the}} 5.7×28mm SS190. The SS190 uses a 2.7-mm (0.11in) shorter projectile with <b>a</b> <b>weight</b> of 2.0g (31grains), which has, when {{fired from the}} P90, a muzzle velocity of roughly 715m/s (2,350ft/s).

The lasers can be configured for three different internal settings: Off– disabled to prevent accidental activation, Training– low intensity for eye safety and extended battery life in training, or Combat– high intensity for maximum visibility.

5|$|The Six Man Tag Team Street Fight {{between the}} team of Jay Lethal and MCMG (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) and {{the team of}} Johnny Devine and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). The {{stipulation}}s were if Lethal and MCMG won then Team 3D {{would be forced to}} work with <b>a</b> <b>weight</b> limit, while if Devine and Team 3D won the TNA X Division would dissemble. Another added stipulation before the contest was whoever gained the pinfall would win the TNA X Division Championship. It lasted twelve minutes and thirty seconds. A Street Fight is fought under no disqualification and no count-out rules, with weapons legal and provided for the match. During the final minutes, both Sabin and Shelley were scripted to appear unconscious at ringside, which caused Lethal to have to fight off Devine and Team 3D alone. Near the end of the match Team 3D set up a table; Lethal followed by sending both out of the ring and laying Devine over the table. Lethal then stood {{on the top of a}} padded turnbuckle and jumped off to perform an elbow drop on Devine through the table to win the match. With the victory, Lethal won the TNA X Division Championship, prevented the X Division from disbanding, and forced Team 3D to work with <b>a</b> <b>weight</b> limit in the company.|$|E
