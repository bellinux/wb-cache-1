Reports generally communicate negative circumstances facing <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> males in the educational, economic, social, and political arenas. These sorts of life experiences have the potential to have a tremendous impact on the lives and development, particularly identity developmental process of young <b>African</b> <b>American</b> men; however, few research efforts have been devoted to specifically exploring the identity development process of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> males. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to examine the meaning of being a young <b>African</b> <b>American</b> man and to explore how the types of experiences and socialization messages contribute to the perception of being a young <b>African</b> <b>American</b> man.

40|$|<b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> females aged 13 to 19 {{are among}} the fastest growing populations of new HIV infections, and those with mental {{illnesses}} are also at risk. Within this demographic, depressive symptoms have correlated with HIV risk-related sexual behaviors (HRRSB) including inconsistent condom use, multiple sexual partners, and early sexual debut. Little is known however, about underlying constructs resulting in HRRSB among clinically depressed <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> females who seek mental health services, or about the links between depression and specific behavioral risks within this group. Guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior, {{the purpose of this}} sequential exploratory mixed methods research (QUAL→QUAN) was to develop {{a better understanding of the}} context of sexual risk for HIV among clinically depressed <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> females. <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> females (N = 128, 13 - 19 years old) were recruited from outpatient mental health facilities and complimentary settings in the Hampton, Virginia and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania metropolitan areas to participate in individual interviews and/or anonymous surveys. The results indicate that the psychopathology of depression (i. e. low self-esteem, hopelessness, guilt, etc.) may create situations where clinically depressed <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> females could become exposed to HIV. Participants recounted stories of how through fear of abandonment and the search for attention and emotional release, the inclination to acquiesce to one 2 ̆ 7 s partners demands (i. e. noncondom use, engaging in undesired sexual activity, etc.) is increased. Empirically, depression severity is a significant determinant of HRRSB including early sexual debut, inconsistent condom use, not inquiring about partners HIV status and engaging in sexual activity under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. The condition is also a moderator of the relationship between adolescents 2 ̆ 7 beliefs and intentions, and condom use at last sex.

40|$|Background: It is {{not clear}} whether the decline in <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> smoking in the 1980 s {{reflected}} a delay in age of onset of regular smoking initiation rather than success in preventing initiation completely. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify whether the marked reductions in <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> smoking in the 1980 s were offset by increased initiation in young adults. Methods: We combined data from the Tobacco Use Supplements of the 1992 - 1993, 1995 - 1996, and 1998 - 1999 Current Population Surveys (n = 512, 258), and reconstructed year of smoking initiation and calculated age-specific incidence of initiation from 1970 to 1992. We then compared detailed age-specific rates of initiation for two 5 -year periods selected to be before and after the documented large declines in <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> smoking. Results: In the time period after marked declines in <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> smoking (1987 - 1991), the incidence of initiation of regular smoking decreased for <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> ages 14 to 16 and increased for ages 18 to 20. Such a delay was not as evident among non-Hispanic Whites. The delay that was slight in regular smoking initiation among <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> relative to non-Hispanic Whites in 1975 - 79 had increased substantially by 1987 - 91. Conclusions: Reductions in <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> smoking in the 1980 s were offset by increased initiation among young adults ages 18 to 20 during this time period and suggest that the window for uptake of regular smoking shifted to older ages for <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> more so than non-Hispanic Whites.

My research question unfolds, "What is the lived experience of writing poetry to uncover the power for <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> girls to name who they really are?" My exploration calls upon the works of such phenomenologists as Edward Casey, John O'Donohue, Michael D. Levin and Martin Heidegger. My study is further augmented by Black feminists scholars and writers such as Patricia Hill Collins, Alice Walker and Zora Neale Hurston. Furthermore, Max van Manen provides a research guide pedagogically on this journey, alongside culturally responsive educators such as Gloria Ladson Billings and Jacqueline Jordan Irvine. The paths, thoughts, and meanings of phenomenology and poetry danced through, between and alongside one another. 	 		 Poetic Eight is what the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> poets of my study have named themselves. The eight poets' names are brought forth by their external identities, lived experiences and cultural collective as <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> girls. And while these identities and names offer some insight into who these girl poets are, the girls, themselves, reveal who they are through their writing and voices.

These insights and suggestions are concluded with my own poetic reflections.

Objectives: To examine the relationship between smoking habits and perceptions of racial discrimination among <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> girls and to identify and test potential psychological mechanisms through which racial discrimination may operate to increase smoking among this group. Methods: A sample of 105 <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> girls (mean age 15. 45 years) derived from a larger cross-sectional research project comprised the sample. Univariate analyses were conducted to provide descriptive data on the participants of the study, including information about their use of licit and illicit substances. Bivariate correlational analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between perceptions of discrimination and smoking habits. The ability of stress to mediate the relationship between discrimination and smoking was examined by using standard analytical procedures for testing mediation models as outlined by Baron and Kenny (1986). Results: The sample (93 %) reported experiencing discrimination and racial discrimination was highly correlated with cigarette smoking (r =. 35, p >. 001). Removing the effects of stress significantly reduced the relationship between racial discrimination and smoking (r =. 17, p <. 05), indicating that racial discrimination is related to smoking because of its stressful nature.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{effective}} culturally responsive treatments {{has become more}} urgent {{as the number of}} ethnic minority clients continues to increase. Previous research with a clinically referred sample of substance-abusing <b>African</b> <b>American</b> inner-city teenagers found that treatment engagement increased when cultural content was incorporated in the therapeutic process (Jackson-Gilfort, Liddle, Tejeda, & Dakof, 2001). This article amplifies these findings by offering clinical guidelines for how to develop and implement culturally specific interventions that contribute to the therapeutic engagement of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> males. Clinical outcomes may be improved by integrating culturally responsive intervention methods within a multisystemic approach to the adolescent’s treatment. Family therapy has a rich tradition of shaping treatments ac-cording to the cultural characteristics of diverse client populations (Falicov, 1983; McGoldrick, Pearce, & Giordano, 1996). Systemic conceptualizations and therapy methods have been tailored to the life experiences of different cultural groups and to the practical needs of the clinical situation (Montalvo & Gutierrez, 1983; Sluzki, 1979). Family therapists also have defined methods of teaching a cultural perspective to new therapists (Falicov, 1988). Working in these traditions, as well as within a treatment devel-opment framework (Kazdin, 1982), this article addresses engage-ment strategies developed to address the characteristics and needs of a particular cultural group, <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> males.

Given the disproportionately high representation of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> youth among individuals living in poverty, their increased exposure to stress in the context of poverty, and the association between stress and psychological symptoms for <b>African</b> <b>American</b> girls, the search for protective factors that foster resilience for low-income <b>African</b> <b>American</b> girls is particularly important. Methods: A modified grounded theory approach was used to analyze audiotaped transcribed focus group discussions, self-esteem written intervention materials, and direct observation notes from self-esteem interventions conducted by study participants. Fennell’s cognitive model of low self-esteem was used as a theoretical framework for this study to help understand which factors contribute to low self-esteem and as a result need to be considered when improving overall self-esteem among <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> girls living in low-income communities. Results: Teaching skills and providing opportunities for girls to practice new skills, guided group discussions and talks, exposure to new experiences, addressing basic needs, healthy relationship building, the positive use of self, spiritual/cultural approaches and the lack of family involvement were all themes that emerged when professionals addressed the self-esteem of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> girls living in low-income communities. The study also discovered that professionals should find ways to include the primary caregiver when addressing self-esteem with this group. Conclusions: The findings suggest that addressing self-esteem with this group begins with understanding their culture, listening to what they need and observing obstacles faced by these girls to sustain a healthy self-esteem. Implications for social work practice are discussed. Keywords: <b>African</b> <b>American</b> girls, <b>African</b> <b>American</b> youth, Self-Esteem...|$|R
40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} adolescents’ understanding of romantic relationship commitment, particularly among African American youth. Using three waves of semistructured interviews, the present descriptive study addresses this topic by exploring {{the ways in which}} 20 <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescents</b> (age range 13 - 19 years) from low-income backgrounds conceptualize and describe commitment in romantic relationships. Qualitative analyses revealed three main themes related to defining commitment, indicating that which commitment provides, and describing the nature of commitment in different relationship contexts. Findings inform psychological research and practice relating to commitment and romantic relationships among <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescents...</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the extent to which}} perceived occupational barriers and perceived parental support predicted career certainty and career indecision in a sample of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescents.</b> Perceived occupational barriers were positively predictive of career indecision, and perceived parental support was positively associated with career certainty. The results provided support for the importance of considering contextual variables, such as perceived occupational barriers and perceived parental support, in the career decision-making processes of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescents.</b> The results also highlighted the salience of social cognitive career theory in conceptualizing career-related issues in African American high school students. Future research directions are discussed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} was to provide {{empirical}} evidence for the notion that social work interventionists should consider identity issues in <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescents</b> as a foci in the development of intervention strategies. The author provides an overview of the major identity constructs and their interrelationships in <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescents.</b> An example of the pervasiveness of relevant identity issues in African American adoles-cents was demonstrated by using a regression analysis to determine how identity characteristics predicted various forms of aggression in incarcerated and nonincarcerated youth. Significant statistical findings and theoretical support was used to sustain the rational of ‘‘identity matters. ’...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundFew HIV/STI {{interventions}} {{exist for}} <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> girls in juvenile detention. ObjectiveThe {{objective was to}} evaluate the efficacy of an intervention to reduce incident STIs, improve HIV-preventive behaviors, and enhance psychosocial outcomes. MethodsWe conducted a randomized controlled trial among <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> girls (13 - 17 years, N= 188) in juvenile detention from March 2011 to May 2012. Assessments occurred at baseline and 3 - and 6 -months post-randomization and included: audio computer-assisted self-interview, condom skills assessment, and self-collected vaginal swab to detect Chlamydia and gonorrhea. InterventionThe Imara intervention included three individual-level sessions and four phone sessions; expedited partner therapy was offered to STI-positive adolescents. The comparison group received the usual care provided by the detention center: STI testing, treatment and counseling. ResultsAt the 6 -month assessment (3 -months post-intervention) Imara participants reported higher condom use self-efficacy (p< 0. 001), HIV/STI knowledge (p< 0. 001), and condom use skills (p< 0. 001) compared to control participants. No significant differences were observed between trial conditions in incident Chlamydia or gonorrhea infections, condom use, or number of vaginal sex partners. ConclusionsImara for detained <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> girls can improve condom use skills and psychosocial outcomes; however, a critical need for interventions to reduce sexual risk remains. 5 UR 6 PS 000679 /PS/NCHHSTP CDC HHS/United StatesF 32 AA 022058 /AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United StatesF 32 AA 022058 /AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United StatesK 01 MH 085506 /MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United StatesK 01 MH 085506 /MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United StatesK 12 GM 000680 /GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United StatesK 12 GM 000680 /GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States 2015 - 11 - 01 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 25190056 PMC 422462...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{burden of}} sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STI) is {{greater in the}} <b>African</b> <b>American</b> community {{than in any other}} racial or ethnic group in the United States. Rates of reported STIs continue to increase especially among the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> female population. The CDC calls for interventions to address the social and cultural conditions related to sexual risk-taking behaviors; however, these conditions must first be identified and described. More qualitative research is needed to describe and to better understand <b>African</b> <b>American</b> sexuality and the sexual risk behaviors of this group. The {{purpose of this study was}} to better understand how <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> females construct sexuality. ^ Aim: The aim of this study was to describe how <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> (15 - 19 years) females 2 ̆ 7 constructions of sexual behaviors reflect their values, beliefs and social influences. ^ Methods: From February to April 2013, a sample of 21 <b>African</b> <b>American</b> girls 2 ̆ 7 between the ages of 15 - 19 years participating in community based afterschool programs in a major urban center in South Central United States was recruited for the study. Both small group interviews and individual interviews were conducted. Data analysis was conducted using an inductive 2 ̆ 2 grounded 2 ̆ 2 analytical approach. ^ Results: Three main categories were identified from the data: the (1) Social Environment, (2) Personal Ethics vs. Emotions, and (3) External Factors. The central theme was the teen 2 ̆ 7 s internal struggle between personal values (ethics) and emotions as it relates to sexuality. This struggle included the tension between social desirability and personal goals, as well as views of condom use related to trust and perceived threat which impact sexual behavior. Elements included in the teen 2 ̆ 7 s social environment that help shape their sexuality were perceived social norms, condom stigma and peer pressure. External influences included media and other sources of information. ^ Conclusion: Findings from this study suggest that the struggle between a teen 2 ̆ 7 s values and emotions along with mixed messages from the social environment and external influences create tension within and between the adolescent 2 ̆ 7 s personal ethic and social forces resulting in a lack of personal agency in making a decision related to sexual behavior. These findings may be used to enhance or modify current interventions and/or aid in the design and development of new sexual risk reduction interventions for <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>adolescent</b> females. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>African</b> <b>American</b> {{children}} are disproportionately over-represented {{in the child}} welfare system. Many of these children linger {{in the system and}} experience disconnection from their biological families, communities, cultural beliefs, values, and practices. Familial socialization and cultural exposure are essential to developing a positive ethnic identity and self-concept. For <b>African</b> <b>American</b> female <b>adolescents,</b> hair and hair care are critical areas for such socialization and support. This qualitative study explored the hair and hair care perceptions and experiences of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> female <b>adolescents</b> in foster care. The goal was to examine hair and hair 2 ̆ 7 s connection to, and influence on, sense of self and self-esteem for <b>African</b> <b>American</b> female <b>adolescents</b> in foster care. Eleven <b>African</b> <b>American</b> female <b>adolescents</b> participated in individual interviews, and grounded theory was used to analyze the data. Four major themes emerged: hair care, perception of hair and identity as an <b>African</b> <b>American</b> female, societal influences on self-awareness, and influence of the foster care system. Results from the study indicated <b>African</b> <b>American</b> female <b>adolescents</b> in foster care identify hair as important. Participants noted hair is connected to appearance and shapes who they are and how they view themselves as <b>African</b> <b>American</b> females. Participants addressed the complexity of hair and politics associated with hair. The findings further emphasized the role of racial socialization and the importance of a supportive hair care environment. Participants also discussed their awareness of societal influences on their perception of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> women. They offered recommendations for improving the hair care experiences of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> children in foster care, for supporting positive development of identity and self-esteem, and for implementing standards of practice that will ensure these youths 2 ̆ 7 cultural needs are addressed in the child welfare system...|$|R
