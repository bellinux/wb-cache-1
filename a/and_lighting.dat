5|$|Each of Hollywood Dream's 5 trains carry 36 {{riders in}} nine coaches, each having {{a row of}} four seats. All trains have an {{on-board}} audio <b>and</b> <b>lighting</b> system, with each seat having a headrest stereo sound system capable of playing one of five songs selected by the rider with a control panel inserted into the seat's restraining lap bar. The on-board audio <b>and</b> <b>lighting</b> system animates LED lights that are built into the trains' sides and front riderless pilot coach. The lighting program varies as the train moves, with different animations for different track sections and the station. The lighting pattern used for the park entrance track section gives {{the effect of a}} Comet with a sparkling head and glittering trail of light.|$|E

40|$|In our {{designed}} culture, every environment, {{object and}} picture is analyzed {{from the viewpoint}} of colour <b>and</b> <b>light.</b> Colour <b>and</b> <b>light</b> {{play an important role in}} social life and culture. This paper springs from an epistemological project about concept formation in the field of colour <b>and</b> <b>light.</b> Based on own observations and scientific and scholarly references it presents a graphic model describing possible constituent relations between colour <b>and</b> <b>light</b> experiences. Design is the art of using knowledge – implicit or explicit – about how humans perceive, experience, and relate to the world around. In design all senses are involved, but when dealing with colour <b>and</b> <b>light</b> we can confine ourselves to vision; designers must understand the conditions of visual perception. Human experience of colour <b>and</b> <b>light</b> has many sources; the given cultural context (conventional meanings of colour <b>and</b> <b>light),</b> the direct experience of the world around (colour <b>and</b> <b>light</b> expressions) <b>and</b> the basic perceptual functions (formal aspects of colour <b>and</b> <b>light).</b> There is need for distinct concepts and concise approaches to understand coherence of aesthetic and functional expressions. Design education calls for coherent and well defined structures that can be used to describe connections and distinctions between experiences of different kinds.

Special emphasis is put on the spatial interaction of colour <b>and</b> <b>light</b> in architecture. The work has the form of seminars /workshops where colour <b>and</b> <b>light</b> specialists from different academic disciplines (six Nordic universities) <b>and</b> companies (<b>light</b> sources, paint, colorimetric standards, window glass) examine different aspects of the problem complex. Sub-projects deal with the epistemology and concepts of colour <b>and</b> <b>light,</b> with methods for analysing colour <b>and</b> <b>light</b> in existing architectural spaces and with the relationship between energy efficiency <b>and</b> <b>light</b> quality...|$|R
