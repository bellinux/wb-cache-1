50|$|Coren defines {{three aspects}} of dog {{intelligence}} in the book: instinctive intelligence, adaptive intelligence, and working and obedience intelligence. Instinctive intelligence refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dog's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> perform the tasks it was bred for, such as herding, pointing, fetching, guarding, or supplying companionship. Adaptive intelligence refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dog's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> solve problems on its own. Working and obedience intelligence refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dog's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> learn from humans.|$|R
50|$|Kin recognition, {{also called}} kin detection, is <b>an</b> organism's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> {{distinguish}} between close genetic kin and non-kin. In evolutionary biology and psychology, such <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> is presumed <b>to</b> have evolved for inbreeding avoidance.|$|R
50|$|Hyperlexia is {{a similar}} but {{different}} disorder where main characteristics are <b>an</b> above-average <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> read with <b>a</b> below-average <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> understand spoken and/or written language.

5|$|A player (or a pair), {{who wins}} {{at least one}} trick {{receives}} <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> gain more round points upon declaring the card combinations. In Tute in Pairs the declarations can be performed {{until the end of}} round; in Two-player Tute this ability persists until only two cards are left in the deck.|$|E
5|$|Careful {{measurement}} of {{the positions of the}} planets has led to a solid understanding of gravitational perturbations, and <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> determine past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy, a field known as celestial mechanics. More recently the tracking of near-Earth objects will allow for predictions of close encounters or potential collisions of the Earth with those objects.|$|E
5|$|Even some nonhuman animals show {{a limited}} ability to add, {{particularly}} primates. In a 1995 experiment imitating Wynn's 1992 result (but using eggplants instead of dolls), rhesus macaque and cottontop tamarin monkeys performed similarly to human infants. More dramatically, after being taught {{the meanings of}} the Arabic numerals 0 through 4, one chimpanzee was able to compute the sum of two numerals without further training. More recently, Asian elephants have demonstrated <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> perform basic arithmetic.|$|E
50|$|While it {{has been}} {{suggested}} the cropping may interfere with <b>a</b> dog's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> communicate using ear signals, some also argue that cropping increases <b>a</b> dog's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> communicate with ear signals. There has been no scientific comparative study of ear communication in cropped and uncropped dogs.|$|R

Some {{people may}} be anosmic for one particular odor. This is known as [...] "specific anosmia". The absence {{of the sense of}} smell from birth is called congenital anosmia.|$|R
5|$|Milne was {{naturally}} right-footed, though trained {{hard with}} his left foot as a boy to become equally skilled with both feet. Former Dundee United teammate Paul Hegarty stated that Milne possessed great pace, as well as bravery, a good work ethic, and <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> score important goals. Another former Dundee United teammate, Davie Dodds, said that Milne was as good a finisher as any player in Scottish football during the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Moult is {{prolonged}} in all tubenoses, since they must maintain <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> fly. Northern populations start replacing their plumage after those further south, reflecting the later start to their breeding season. Birds in a Welsh colony commenced moulting in early August, while populations in northern Spain and the Balearics started in early July and mid-June respectively. Breeding birds moult later than non-breeders.|$|E
5|$|The cagA gene {{codes for}} one of the major H. pylori {{virulence}} proteins. Bacterial strains with the cagA gene are associated with <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> cause ulcers. The cagA gene codes for a relatively long (1186-amino acid) protein. The cag pathogenicity island (PAI) has about 30 genes, part of which code for a complex type IV secretion system. The low GC-content of the cag PAI relative {{to the rest of the}} Helicobacter genome suggests the island was acquired by horizontal transfer from another bacterial species.|$|E

5|$|Ant {{societies}} have division of labour, communication between individuals, and <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> solve complex problems. These parallels with human {{societies have}} long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rituals. Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), are regarded as invasive species, establishing themselves in areas {{where they have been}} introduced accidentally.|$|E
5|$|As early Homo sapiens {{began to}} diversify the {{ecological}} zones that they inhabited during the MSA, {{the archaeological record}} associated with these zones begins to show evidence for regional continuities. These continuities are significant {{for a number of}} reasons. The expansion of Homo sapiens into various ecological zones demonstrates <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> adapt to a variety of environmental contexts including marine environments, savanna grasslands, relatively arid deserts, and forests. This adaptability is reflected in MSA artifacts found in these zones. These artifacts display stylistic variability depending on zone. During the Acheulian, which spanned from 1.5 million years ago to 300 thousand years ago, lithic technology displayed incredible homogeneity throughout all ecological niches. MSA technologies, with their evidence for regional variability and continuity, represent a remarkable advance. These data have been used to support theories of social and stylistic development throughout the MSA.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of his {{succession}} Chamberlain's personality was not well known to the public, though he had made annual budget broadcasts for six years. According to Chamberlain biographer Robert Self, these appeared relaxed and modern, showing <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> speak directly to the camera. Chamberlain had few friends among his parliamentary colleagues. An attempt by his Parliamentary Private Secretary, Lord Dunglass (later Prime Minister himself as Alec Douglas-Home) to bring him to the Smoking Room in the Commons to socialise with his colleagues, ended in embarrassing silence. Chamberlain compensated for these shortcomings by devising the most sophisticated press management system employed by a Prime Minister up to that time, with officials at Number 10 led by his chief of press George Steward, convincing members of the press that they were colleagues sharing power and insider knowledge, and should espouse the government line.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Narayan's {{writings}} {{tend to be more}} descriptive and less analytical; the objective style, rooted in a detached spirit, providing for a more authentic and realistic narration. His attitude, coupled with his perception of life, provided a unique ability to fuse characters and actions, and <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> use ordinary events to create a connection {{in the mind of the}} reader. A significant contributor to his writing style was his creation of Malgudi, a stereotypical small town, where the standard norms of superstition and tradition apply.|$|E

5|$|Dr. George Spomer of the University of Idaho has {{discovered}} protocarnivorous activity and function in several glandular plant species, including Cerastium arvense, Ipomopsis aggregata, Heuchera cylindrica, Mimulus lewisii, Penstemon attenuata, Penstemon diphyllus, Potentilla glandulosa var. intermedia, Ribes cereum, Rosa nutkana var. hispida, Rosa woodsii var. ultramontana, Solanum tuberosum, Stellaria americana, and Stellaria jamesiana. These species {{tested positive for}} protease activity, though {{it is unclear whether}} the protease is produced by the plant or by surface microbes. Two other species evaluated by Dr. Spomer, Geranium viscosissimum and Potentilla arguta, exhibited protease activity and were further examined with 14C-labeled algal protein for nutrient absorption activity. Both of these latter species displayed <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> digest and absorb the labeled protein.|$|E
5|$|Echolocation {{probably}} first derived in bats from communicative calls. The Eocene bats Icaronycteris and Palaeochiropteryx had cranial adaptations suggesting <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> detect ultrasound, implying {{they used}} echolocation. This {{may have been}} used at first mainly for communicative purposes or for mapping out their surroundings during their gliding phase, only being used for hunting insects while foraging on the ground or among vegetation. After the adaptation of flight was established, it may have been refined to target flying prey. Bats may have evolved echolocation through a shared common ancestor, in which case it was then lost in the Old World fruit bats, only to be regained in the horseshoe bats; or, echolocation evolved independently in both the Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera lineages.|$|E
5|$|Georges, an only child, showed early {{aptitude}} {{for music and}} quickly picked up the basics of musical notation from his mother, who probably gave him his first piano lessons. By listening {{at the door of}} the room where Adolphe conducted his classes, Georges learned to sing difficult songs accurately from memory and developed <b>an</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> identify and analyse complex chordal structures. This precocity convinced his ambitious parents that he was ready to begin studying at the Conservatoire even though he was still only nine years old (the minimum entry age was 10). Georges was interviewed by Joseph Meifred, the horn virtuoso who was a member of the Conservatoire's Committee of Studies. Meifred was so struck by the boy's demonstration of his skills that he waived the age rule and offered to take him as soon as a place became available.|$|E
