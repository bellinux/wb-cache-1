5|$|Despite the defeat, the {{soldiers}} were received <b>as</b> <b>heroes</b> in Santiago. Thanks to Las Heras, a potential disaster for the patriot armies turned into a minor setback. The army was reorganized again, but the deaths, injuries and desertions caused by the defeat at Cancha Rayada reduced its size to 5,000 soldiers, which was closer to the royalist forces. They took position next to the Maipo River, near Santiago.|$|E
5|$|France had {{threatened}} to invade the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo. In 1808, the Spanish Crown sent their Navy, {{under the command of}} Puerto Rican Captain Ramón Power y Giralt, to prevent the invasion of Santo Domingo by the French by enforcing a blockade. Col. Rafael Conti organized a military expedition with the intention of defending the Dominican Republic. They were successful and were proclaimed <b>as</b> <b>heroes</b> by the Spanish Government.|$|E

5|$|Onshore, civilians woke on {{the morning}} of 23 November to find that the most {{powerful}} ships in their navy, crewed by the lowest of the underclass, were firing on the city. Thousands quickly fled, although nearly all were unable to. The press initially stoked these peoples' fears, although they later flipped to lionizing the rebels, portraying them <b>as</b> <b>heroes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Popular {{heroes and}} leaders of the Greek Revolution, such as Generals Theodoros Kolokotronis and Yiannis Makriyiannis, who opposed the Bavarian-dominated regency, were charged with treason, put in jail and sentenced to death. They were later pardoned under popular pressure, while Greek judges who {{resisted}} Bavarian pressure and refused to sign the death warrants (Anastasios Polyzoidis and Georgios Tertsetis, for instance), were saluted <b>as</b> <b>heroes.</b>|$|E

5|$|In Libya {{and other}} {{countries}} of the region, mass celebrations erupted, with the Lufthansa hijackers and the liberated Munich perpetrators being treated <b>as</b> <b>heroes.</b> Right after their arrival at the airport, a press conference was held, which was broadcast live around the world. The Libyan government led by Muammar Gaddafi allowed the Munich attackers to take refuge and go into hiding, ignoring the demands of West German foreign minister Scheel {{to put them on}} trial. In a large scale covert operation dubbed Wrath of God, Israel would subsequently aim at them being tracked down and killed.|$|E
5|$|In May 1970, {{the crews}} of two Cuban fishing boats were kidnapped by Florida-based {{dissident}} group Alpha 66, who demanded that Cuba release imprisoned militants. Under U.S. pressure, the hostages were released, and Castro welcomed them back <b>as</b> <b>heroes.</b> In April 1971, Castro was internationally condemned for ordering {{the arrest of}} dissident poet Heberto Padilla; Padilla was freed, but the government established the National Cultural Council to ensure that intellectuals and artists supported the administration.|$|E
5|$|In {{the long}} term, however, the British backed Iraq and {{rejected}} an international {{inquiry into the}} killings, fearing that this may provoke further massacres against Christians. They also did not insist on punishing the offenders, who were now seen <b>as</b> <b>heroes</b> by Iraqis. The official British stance was to defend the Iraqi government for its perseverance and patience {{in dealing with the}} crisis and to attribute the massacres to rogue army units. A report on the battle of Dirabun blames the Assyrians, defends the actions of the Iraqi Army, and commends Sidqi as a good officer.|$|E

5|$|Sonic and {{his friends}} still want to return home, so they {{repeatedly}} scuffle for the Emeralds with Doctor Eggman, his robot assistants—the hyperactive, attention-seeking Bokkun and the bumbling Bocoe and Decoe—and his larger, armed robots. Eggman plans {{to take over the}} world, catching the attention of the unnamed nation's President, so Knuckles, Rouge, and federal agent Topaz work to stop him. The other anthropomorphic residents soon join the crusade and, when Eggman is defeated, they are all hailed <b>as</b> <b>heroes.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{lawsuits}} {{damaged the}} public {{image of the}} Wright brothers, who were generally regarded before this <b>as</b> <b>heroes.</b> Critics said the brothers were greedy and unfair and compared their actions unfavorably to European inventors, who worked more openly. Supporters said the brothers were protecting their interests and were justified in expecting fair compensation for the years of work leading to their successful invention. Their 10-year friendship with Octave Chanute, already strained by tension over how much credit, if any, he might deserve for their success, collapsed after he publicly criticized their actions.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of his}} {{security}} clearance ended Oppenheimer's role in government and policy. He became an academic exile, cut off from his former career and the world he had helped to create. The reputations {{of those who had}} testified against Oppenheimer were tarnished as well, and Oppenheimer's reputation was later partly rehabilitated by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. The brief period when scientists were hailed <b>as</b> <b>heroes</b> uniquely qualified to comment on public policy was ended, and scientists working within the government were on notice that dissent was no longer tolerated.|$|E

5|$|The one {{exception}} to the general rule of concealment and obfuscation was that of border guards who died on duty. Most were killed either deliberately or accidentally by escapees or escape helpers. The dead guards were hailed by East German government propaganda <b>as</b> <b>heroes,</b> but West German public opinion was divided about the morality of killing border guards. Some took the view that escapees were entitled to use force {{in the course of}} crossing the border, but (as in one case tried in a West Berlin court) others saw the guard's life as taking priority over an escapee's freedom.|$|E
5|$|The two German governments {{promoted}} {{very different}} views of the border. The GDR saw it as the international frontier of a sovereign state– a defensive rampart against Western aggression. In Grenzer ("Border Guard"), a 1981 East German Army propaganda film, NATO and West German troops and tanks were depicted as ruthless militarists advancing towards East Germany. Border troops interviewed in the film described {{what they saw as}} the rightfulness of their cause and the threat of Western agents, spies and provocateurs. Their colleagues killed on the border were hailed <b>as</b> <b>heroes</b> and schoolchildren in East Berlin were depicted saluting their memorial.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, {{seventeen}} {{people were}} indicted {{by a federal}} grand jury and five were found guilty of wilfully interfering with a marshal in performance of his duties (Braden, Patterson, Pryor, Purcell, and John J. Doyle, a leader in the Settler's League). They were convicted in federal court (with Judge Sawyer presiding) and sentenced to eight months in prison and fined $300 each. Their time spent in imprisonment was hardly difficult. Three of the men's wives were allowed to live with them, and Susan Curtis, daughter of one of the jailers, fell in love with and later married Braden. Upon their release in September 1881, they were greeted by a joyous crowd of 3,000 in Hanford. Such was the anti-railroad sentiment that the five were looked upon <b>as</b> <b>heroes</b> by many across California, and those killed were considered martyrs who had given their lives for a cause.|$|E

5|$|News of the Donner Party's {{fate was}} spread eastward by Samuel Brannan, an elder of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and journalist, who {{ran into the}} salvage party as they {{came down from the}} pass with Keseberg. Accounts of the ordeal first reached New York City in July 1847. Reporting on the event across the U.S. was heavily {{influenced}} by the national enthusiasm for westward migration. In some papers, news of the tragedy was buried in small paragraphs despite the contemporary tendency to sensationalize stories. Several newspapers, including those in California, wrote about the cannibalism in graphic exaggerated detail. In some print accounts, the members of the Donner Party were depicted <b>as</b> <b>heroes,</b> and California a paradise worthy of significant sacrifices.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi Propaganda Ministry {{was quick}} to {{capitalise}} on the successful raid, and radio broadcasts by the popular journalist Hans Fritzsche displayed the triumph felt throughout Germany. Prien and his crew reached Wilhelmshaven at 11:44 on 17 October and were immediately greeted <b>as</b> <b>heroes,</b> learning that Prien had been awarded the Iron Cross First Class, and each man of the crew the Iron Cross Second Class. Hitler sent his personal plane to bring the crew to Berlin, where he further invested Prien with the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. This decoration, made {{for the first time}} to a German submarine officer, later became the customary decoration for successful U-Boat commanders. Dönitz was rewarded by promotion from Commodore to Rear-Admiral and was made Flag Officer of U-Boats.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts was wildly successful, {{shipping}} {{more than}} four million copies worldwide; Shimomura's music was frequently cited {{as one of the}} highlights of the game, and the title track has been ranked as the fourth-best role-playing game title track of all time. The soundtrack has led to two albums of piano arrangements. Kingdom Hearts was the last soundtrack that she worked on at Square. After the release of Kingdom Hearts in 2002, Shimomura left Square for maternity leave, and began work as a freelancer in 2003. She has built on the work she did while at Square; since leaving she has composed or is composing music for eleven Kingdom Hearts games and Nintendo's Mario & Luigi series. She has also worked on many other projects, such <b>as</b> <b>Heroes</b> of Mana and various arranged albums. In February 2014, Shimomura played piano at a retrospective 25th anniversary concert at Tokyo FM Hall. She performed songs from games such as Kingdom Hearts, Live a Live, and Street Fighter II. During the Beware the Forest's Mushrooms performance from Super Mario RPG, Shimomura was joined onstage by fellow game composer Yasunori Mitsuda, who played the Irish bouzouki. She most recently composed and produced the majority of the score for Final Fantasy XV, which she began writing for in 2006, a decade before the game was released.|$|E
