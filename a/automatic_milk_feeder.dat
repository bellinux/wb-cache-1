40|$|In {{artificial}} rearing, calves {{are separated}} from their dam usually within 24 h after birth and any further social contacts to the mother are prevented. Although this is common in practice we expect severe consequences on the health state, weight gain and stress response of the young calf. Two groups of calves suckled by their mother (unrestricted contact, n= 14; contact twice daily for 15 minutes each before milking, n= 15) were compared to two control groups that were both fed via <b>automatic</b> <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> (maximal six times daily, n= 14; twice daily, n= 14). The calves of the four treatment groups were kept in the same barn and cows were milked twice daily. All calves were weaned at 13 weeks of age. The calves were weighed weekly until 3 weeks after weaning. The health state of each animal was assessed daily and all veterinary treatments were recorded until weaning. Stress response to a long-term stressor (absence of the mother) was assessed by stimulation of the HPA axis by ACTH administration (at 11 weeks of age). For statistical analyses, linear mixed-effects models were used. The health state of both suckled groups was poorer (p= 0. 046, caused by diarrhoea), {{but the number of}} animals that had to be treated by a veterinarian did not differ. During the milk feeding period, weight gain was better in suckled calves (p< 0. 001). After weaning, the weight gain of all treatment groups was diminished, especially in suckled calves (p< 0. 001). Cortisol response to ACTH administration was reduced in calves fed via an <b>automatic</b> <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> (p< 0. 001). The higher weight gain in suckled calves before weaning {{can be explained by the}} large milk amounts the calves received. These results suggest that suckled calves show fewer signs of chronic stress. We conclude that rearing without contact with the mother causes chronic stress in young calves in terms of desensitization of the HPA axis...|$|E
40|$|Dairy calves {{are usually}} raised by {{artificial}} milk feeding systems where {{their need to}} perform sucking is not fulfilled. This thesis investigated the effects of various milk feeding and weaning methods on the calves ’ behaviour, intake and weight gain. In paper I calves were fed from an <b>automatic</b> <b>milk</b> <b>feeder.</b> It was found that gradual weaning over 14 days reduced the occurrence of cross-sucking immediately after weaning and it stimulated the calves to eat more concentrate during weaning compared to abrupt weaning. A high milk allowance (9. 2 vs. 4. 8 litres) reduced the number and duration of unrewarded visits and thus reduced individual calves ’ occupancy of the feeder. In paper II calves were fed milk from teat-bars with either a common milk compartment for all teats or a separate milk compartments for every teat. The teat-bar design {{did not affect the}} variation in milk intake within the groups, but a teat-bar with separate compartments increased the teat switching while there was still milk left in {{one or more of the}} compartments. Gradual weaning over 10 days stimulated the calves to eat more concentrate during weaning as compared to weaning by diluting the milk. The occurrence of cross-sucking was low with this milk feeding system...|$|E

The foals were reared in an indoor box, weighed every 3 weeks from day 4 after birth and observed for 24 consecutive hours at the age of 4, 10, 47, 114, 142 and 176 days, to compile an ethogram which includes biorhythms, and social, alimentary and eliminative behavioural patterns. During the study, "daily weight gains" were greater than 1610 g/d; but between 26 and 46 days and after weaning, values were lower than 1230 g/d, and between 172 and 193 days, prior to slaughtering, they were of 1090 g/d. Age had a significant influence (P< 0. 001) on almost all the ethological parameters considered, above all for the time spent lying down and the licking structures (P< 0. 01), and for the drinking bouts (P< 0. 05).

40|$|The subject ‘young stock rearing’ is {{important}} for future dairy farming. So far there has been too little attention for young stock rearing. Proper care by monitoring health and growth of the young animals will lengthen life expectancy and increase milk production of the adult dairy cow.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present article was to summarize available evidence of the economic benefits and health risks {{associated with the use}} of <b>automatic</b> <b>milk</b> <b>feeders</b> (AMFs) in calves. Although AMFs are increasingly used in cattle production, clear evidence of their economic benefits (increased average daily gain, gradual weaning and reduced labor time) for the typical Belgian farm size and management is not available. Especially in smaller farms, where labor time is not a limiting factor, a careful economic consideration should be made. Regarding the association of AMFs with calf disease, studies have only been performed for bovine respiratory disease and confirmed an increased risk. However, since the use of AMFs is strongly related with several other risk factors (group housing at young age, large groups, age difference in a group, continuous system versus all-in/all-out), it is difficult to unequivocally identify the risk associated with AMFs alone. A group size of less than ten calves on a single drinking point, an all-in/alloutb grouping system and a minimum age at introduction to the automat of three weeks are recommended for farms with AMFs. To the authors’ knowledge, no scientific evidence supporting the presumed association of diarrhea and tongue ulcers with AMFs is available to date...|$|R

After euthanasia, Intestinal contents and tissues (proximal jejunum and ileum) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were collected. The residual immunoreactivity of β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) and caseins (Cns) present in the digestive compartments was determined by ELISA. The paracellular permeability (using FITC-dextran 4000) was evaluated using Ussing chambers. The EXP formula enhanced the resistance to proteolysis of β-lg and Cns. It modified microbiota {{with an increase in}} proteobacteria and a decrease in firmicutes. Ileal density (g/cm) was greater in EXP-fed piglets at 28 d. A decreased jejunal permeability was observed between d 7 and d 28 in EXP-fed piglets which was not observed with STD. There was an important effect of formula components on the secretory activity of MLN: a major immunosuppressor effect of the lipid fraction extracted from digestas of both formulas was evidenced. In conclusion, the lipid composition in infant formulas influenced the neonatal intestinal physiology through release of immunomodulatory lipids, modulation of proteolysis and modification of progressive colonisation of the infant digestive tract by bacteria...|$|E

Blood was analysed for acid-base balance, biochemical and hematological values, minerals and hemoglobin derivatives. Effects of season (groupl: calvings from October tili December; group 2 : calvings from January tili April) and of gender were considered. Growth Performance was different between the groups at all age points. Group effects existed at 15 days (RT, Hk, MetHb, Laktat, P), at 30 days (RT, P), at 60 days (Hb, O 2 CAP, pH, BE, HCO 3, P), at 90 days (pCO 2, blood urea, Mg, Fe). Gender effects became obvious at 30 days (O 2 CONT, O 2 SAT, MetHb, HHb, pCO 2). Interactions of group and gender occured at 15 days (P), at 30 days (O 2 CONT, pCO 2), at 60 days (COHb, Mg) and at 90 days (Hb, O 2 CAP). Between age point mean differences could be found for acid-base Status, total protein, albumin, Creatinine, blood urea, glucose, Mg and for the hematological variables.

The formulas were distributed with an <b>automatic</b> <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> to piglets until slaughter at 28 days. Intestinal contents and tissues (proximal jejunum and ileum) as well as mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were collected. The residual immunoreactivity of β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) and caseins (Cns) present in the digestive compartments was determined by ELISA. Mononuclear cells isolated from MLN were cultured in vitro to evaluate their cytokine secretory profiles. Microbiota diversity and composition was assessed using DHPLC and metasequencing analysis. Finally the immunomodulatory capacity of peptide and lipid fractions extracted from the jejunal contents of STD and EXP piglets were tested in vitro on MLN cells from sow’s suckling piglets. The immunoreactivity of β-lg and Cns was higher in EXP than in STD intestinal contents. The secretory activity of MLN cells was modified by the formula composition, the highest IFNγ secretion was obtained in EXP piglets. A major immunosuppressor effect of lipid fractions was evidenced with both formulas. Microbiota clustering successfully discriminated infant formulas according to the presence of exclusive vegetable vs. a combination of milk and vegetable lipids. Differences in proteobacteria and firmicutes phyla were observed.

40|$|In 2000 {{the book}} Robotic Milking, {{reflecting}} {{the proceedings of}} an International Symposium which was held in The Netherlands came out. At that time, commercial introduction of <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> systems was no longer obstructed by technological inadequacies.

However, it was recognised that the changeover from “traditional” to <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> affected the farming operation, herd management and control of milk quality profoundly and {{that many of the}} implications were still unknown. So, new challenges in various fields of dairy farming and new research areas emerged. Since this previous International Symposium, much has happened.

The number of farms <b>milking</b> with an <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> system has worldwide increased to more than 2. 200 by the end of 2003.

40|$|Milk {{phospholipids}} and lipids {{have been}} associated with modulation of membrane properties and intestinal inflammation, but less is known on their effects on the development of gut physiology and immune system in neonates. Two infant formulas differing by the presence of bovine milk phospholipids and lipids (CRTL: a standard-based formula adapted to neonatal pig requirement; PLUS: CRTL plus phospholipids and lipids) were distributed with an <b>automatic</b> <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> to 36 piglets during the nursing period (i. e. 28 days). The residual immunoreactivity of β-lactoglobulin and caseins present in the digestive compartments was determined by ELISA. The intestinal permeability was evaluated using Ussing chambers. Mononuclear cells were isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and cultured in presence of a mitogen to evaluate their cytokine pattern. Physiological data were compared to previous data obtained on same aged-sow suckling piglets. Moreover, immunoregulatory capacity of peptide and lipid fractions extracted from jejunal digestas was evaluated in vitro on mitogen-stimulated MLN cells from sow suckling 7 days-old piglets. The immunoreactivity of β-lactoglobulin and caseins was higher in PLUS than CRTL digestas both in jejunum and ileum. Higher intestinal thickness observed in PLUS group was not associated with changes in permeability. The reduced mononuclear cell density in MLN of PLUS-fed piglets indicated a modification of the mobilization or recruitment of MLN cells. PLUS formula also increased IFNγ secretion suggesting an improved intestinal immune system maturation such as observed in sow suckling piglets. Finally, a major immunosuppressor effect of the lipid fractions was evidenced with both formulas. However, the less severe inhibitor activity of lipids extracted from PLUS digesta may participate in the in vivo increased IFNγ secretion in PLUS formula-fed piglets. In conclusion, introduction of milk phospholipids and lipids in infant formula induced modifications of the intestinal immune system maturation that may promote intestinal immune system maturation similar to sow suckling piglets...|$|E
40|$|Gut {{microflora}} {{is acknowledged}} {{as a major}} contributor to Health whatever the physiological stage. In the neonatal period, microbial colonization of the infant gut is essential {{for the development of the}} intestinal and immune systems. The profile of intestinal microbiota is influenced by genetics and environment, including the route of delivery and early dietary intake. The microbiota of full-term, vaginally delivered, breast-fed infant is considered as ideally healthy. Human milk consumption shapes the infant microbiota thanks to its unique mix of antimicrobial proteins, abundant sIgA, but also milk fat components such as polar lipids and a broad range of fatty acids that may influence the ecology of the neonatal microbiota. Structure, composition and physiological properties of Human milk are better mimicked in infant formulas that include milk lipids and milk fat membrane extracts although very few infant formulae use milk lipids more expensive than vegetable lipids. In this context, two formulas based on i) vegetable fat (STD) or ii) a blend of vegetable fat and milk lipids stabilized by milk fat membrane extracts (EXP) were distributed with an <b>automatic</b> <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> to piglets from birth until 28 days. At this stage, feces were collected and analyzed in terms of microbial diversity by metasequencing (16 S rRNA extraction and sequencing, GS-FLEX 454 Roche). The EXP formula modified positively the microbiota with an increase in proteobacteria and a decrease in firmicutes. This shift is also observed in breast-fed compared to formula-fed 6 mths-old neonates. In conclusion, the milk fat addition in infant formulas modulated the intestinal microbiota. The persistence of these modifications and their impact on adult metabolism will be further investigated to elucidate the links between early milk fat intake, intestinal maturation and microbial colonization of the infant gut...|$|E

Facilities for teat cleaning and separation of abnormal milk are incorporated into the automatic system and several adaptations are needed to accommodate continuous milking. Cow management including routing within the barn, the opportunity for grazing and the use of total mixed rations is altered.

In terms of quality control, AM-systems offer extra means to assure milk quality and food safety. No adverse effects of the transition have been found for body condition, lameness or teat condition. A potential risk is that fertility of the herd may decline faster than the current trend for conventional dairy farms. The only obvious change was that milk cell count, often an indicator of the prevalence of mastitis, increased overall. <b>Automatic</b> <b>milking</b> systems require a higher investment than conventional milking systems. However increased milk yields and reduced labour requirements may lead to a decrease in the fixed costs per kg <b>milk.</b> <b>Automatic</b> <b>milking</b> is gaining widespread acceptance and is estimated to be in use on more than 2500 farms in over 20 countries worldwide...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDairy calves {{are often}} {{separated}} from the cow soon after birth and prevented from nursing, but {{little is known about}} the effects of nursing on the development of the cow–calf bond. This study evaluated the effect of nursing on affiliative behaviours between the dam and her calf including allogrooming, proximity and latency to reunite after a period of separation. Holstein cow–calf pairs were randomly allocated to three treatments differing only in nutritional dependency on the dam: <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> (n= 10 pairs), combined (n= 10 pairs) or nursing (n= 10 pairs). <b>Milk</b> <b>feeder</b> calves could feed ad libitum from an automated milk-feeder, combined calves could suckle from their dams at night and could feed ad libitum from an automated <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> and nursing calves could suckle from their dams at night. Cows and calves were kept together during the night (between 20 : 00 h and 08 : 00 h) and were housed adjacent to each other during the day (between 08 : 00 h and 20 : 00 h). Direct live observations were performed 2 h following the opening of the gate that allowed calves to mix with cows at night. All pairs spent more time (% of observations) allogrooming each other (i. e. own cow/calf) than they did grooming other cows and calves within the same group (10 ± 0. 8 % vs. 0. 4 ± 0. 7 %, t 29 = 168. 8, P< 0. 001). The time cow–calf pairs spent allogrooming did not vary with treatment; 10. 0 ± 0. 8 %, F 2, 27 = 0. 4, P= 0. 696). Similarly, time spent in close proximity without nursing did not differ among treatments; 31 ± 2. 6 %, F 2, 27 = 0. 6, P= 0. 543). The percentage of occasions a pair did not reunite (i. e. not observed within 1 m of each other within 3 min) was 23 % for the <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> pairs, 38 % for the combined pairs and 32 % for the nursing pairs (χ 2 = 3. 9, P= 0. 415). Nevertheless suckling from another cow than own dam was observed at least once by 19 of the 20 calves that were allowed to suckle. Latency to reunite (among pairs that did so within 180 s) was highest for the combined pairs and tended to be lower for <b>milk</b> <b>feeder</b> and nursing calves; 52. 5 ± 16. 0, 23. 3 ± 8. 3 and 12. 9 ± 5. 8; F 2, 24 = 3. 1, P= 0. 062).

40|$|Sensor {{systems for}} oestrus and disease {{detection}} are increasingly used on dairy farms. It is, however, not known whether using sensor systems also improves production, health, reproduction and economic {{performance of the}} farm. The first objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the effect of sensor systems on milk production, days to first service and somatic cell count of the herd. The second objective is to investigate the impact of investment in sensor systems on several cost components and revenues. Data on production, health and reproduction over the years 2003 - 2013 was available for 414 Dutch dairy farms with sensor systems on an <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> system (n= 103), with sensor systems on a conventional milking system (n= 49) and without (n= 262) sensor systems. In addition, farm accounting data of 217 dairy farms with sensor systems on an <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> system (n= 54), with sensor systems on a conventional milking system (n= 36) and without (n= 127) sensor systems was available for the years 2008 - 2013. Having sensor systems was associated with a higher average production per cow on farms with an <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> system, and with a lower average production per cow on farms with a conventional milking system in the years after investment. Farms with an <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> system had on average 12, 000 cells/ml higher somatic cell count after adoption of the sensor system whereas farms with a conventional milking system had on average 10, 000 cells/ml lower somatic cell count. Total capital costs and milk revenues increased after investment in sensor systems on farms with an <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> system. Labour costs did not decrease after investment in sensor systems. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the profitability of dairy farms using an <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> system (AMS) compared with a conventional milking system (CMS) based on real accounting data. In total, 62 farms (31 AMS and 31 CMS) were analyzed for the year 2003, using a case control study. Results of 2003 showed that AMS farms used on average 29 % less labor and had € 7, 899 lower revenues. CMS farms had € 15, 566 more available for rent, depreciation, interest, labour and profit (RDILP) than AMS farms. AMS farms had greater revenues, margin, and gross margin per full time employee, resulting in a substantial (but not statistical significant) greater RDILP per full time employee. Costs for depreciation and interest were larger for AMS farms than for CMS farms. Therefore, farm managers should consider the extra time acquired by <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> against extra costs associated with an AMS.

50|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>milking</b> or 'robotic milking' sheds {{can be seen}} in Australia, New Zealand, the U.S., Canada, {{and many}} European countries. Current <b>automatic</b> <b>milking</b> sheds use the {{voluntary}} milking (VM) method. These allow the cows to voluntarily present themselves for milking at any time of the day or night, although repeat visits may be limited by the farmer through computer software. A robot arm is used to clean teats and apply milking equipment, while automated gates direct cow traffic, eliminating the need for the farmer to be present during the process. The entire process is computer controlled.|$|R
