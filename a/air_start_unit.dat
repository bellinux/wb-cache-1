50|$|An <b>Air</b> <b>Start</b> <b>Unit</b> is {{a device}} used {{to start the}} aircraft's engines when the aircraft's APU is not operational. There are three primary types of these devices that exist currently: a stored air cart, a gas turbine based unit, and a diesel engine driven screw {{compressor}} unit. All three devices create a source of high pressure air to start the aircraft engines. Typically one or two hoses are connect to these units, with the largest aircraft engines requiring three.|$|E
40|$|Air start {{units are}} an {{invaluable}} piece of aviation common support equipment (CSE) which provide primary, secondary, and ground maintenance start capability for Navy and Marine Corps aircraft.

If the <b>air</b> <b>start</b> <b>unit</b> fails, there will be no chance of the getting the aircraft airborne to perform its intended mission. Today the Huffer and its GTCP 100 - 82 engine, which is housed in both a shore based and carrier configuration, is the Navy and Marine Corps' primary <b>air</b> <b>start</b> <b>unit.</b> Current operational Huffers range from 10 to 30 years old, and must be overhauled every 3 years at the depot level.

The author determines {{the boundaries of the}} assured quality area considering mathematical model analysis and defect detection of rotor blades {{based on the results of}} natural vibration frequency measurements. Description and working principle of the turbine compressor package GTK- 10 - 4 Turbine compressor package GTK- 10 - 4 is designed on the basis of the aeronautical drive NK- 16 ST and used for pipeline gas transmission [1]. The package is a machine mounted on a reinforced concrete base; the equipment parts of the package are arranged in separate transportable units (Fig. 1) and comprise the following major components: 1. Air-intake chamber 1 used for atmospheric air purification flowing into the axial flow compressor; starter motor 2 (turbo expander, <b>air</b> <b>start</b> <b>unit</b> or electrical starter) used for initial spinning of an axial flow compressor (AC) and a high pressure turbine at the start of the turbine compressor package. 2. Axial compressor 3 used for air supply into combustion chamber (CC) of a gas turbine engine. 3. High pressure turbine (HP turbine) 4 used as an axial compressor drive and mounted on the same shaft. 4. Low pressure turbine (LP turbine) 5 driving a centrifugal natural gas supercharger and constituting a centrifugal gas compressor. 5...|$|E

The explosion perforated the aircraft's fuel cells, and ignited the leaking JP-5 jet fuel. About a minute later, three additional Zuni rockets exploded; these blasts blew holes into the flight deck, allowing the burning JP-5 to pour into the 03 level directly under the flight deck. Captain Kent Lee, commanding officer of the Enterprise, directed the port turn to continue after the first explosion, steering the ship into the wind to blow smoke away from the ship.Approximately three minutes after the initial explosion, a bomb mounted on the Phantom exploded, having been engulfed in flames from the earlier explosions and burning fuel. This explosion blew a larger hole, approximately eight feet by seven feet, in the flight deck. The heat from the blast ignited additional fires on the 03 level, and debris from the explosion caused holes in the deck; this allowed burning fuel to spread further, entering the 02 and 01 levels and eventually the first deck. This explosion also damaged the twin agent units that provided firefighting foam to the area, rendering them inoperable as well as severing fire hoses in the area. In short order two 500 lb (227 kg) Mark 82 bombs detonated in succession. Several minutes after the detonations a bomb rack holding three Mk 82 bombs exploded. This blast tore a large hole, approximately 18 feet by 22 feet, into the flight deck, and ruptured a 6,000-gallon fuel tank mounted on a tanker aircraft; a massive fireball resulted from the fuel igniting, spreading the fire further. All told, eighteen explosions occurred, blowing eight holes into the flight deck and beyond.|$|R
50|$|In Pacific 1940 (and Europe 1940), airbases may be {{built on}} any {{territory}} controlled by that power, and provide one additional movement point to <b>air</b> <b>units</b> <b>starting</b> in that space. Fighters and tactical bombers on islands (but not coastal territories) with airbases may also choose to scramble and defend the surrounding sea zone should combat arise. After battle, any surviving scrambled aircraft are returned to the island during, unless the island was captured, {{in which case the}} rules for stranded aircraft apply to them. Since Pacific 1940, airbases are susceptible to strategic bombing: an airbase accumulating three points of damage is considered neutralized, and airbases may not accumulate more than six damage points. In strategic bombing raids against air bases, the bases are considered to be defended by their own anti-air defenses which shoot at all the attacking bombers, and any normal AAA in the zone do not fire.|$|R
40|$|The air-start {{capability}} of a secondary engine control (SEC) was tested for a DEEC-equipped F 100 engine and installed in an F- 15 airplane. Two air-start schedules were tested. The first {{was referred to}} as the group I schedule; the second or revised schedule was the group II start schedule. Using the group I start schedule, an airspeed of 300 knots was required to ensure successful 40 - and 25 -percent SEC-mode <b>air</b> <b>starts.</b> If N 2 were less than 40 percent, a stall would occur when the start bleeds closed 40 sec after initiation of the <b>air</b> <b>start.</b> All JFS-assisted <b>air</b> <b>starts</b> were successful with the group start schedule. For the group II schedule, the time between pressurization and start-bleed closure ranged between 50 and 72 sec depending on altitude. All <b>air</b> <b>starts</b> were successful above 225 knots givin a 75 -knot reduction in required airspeed for a successful <b>air</b> <b>start.</b> Spooldown <b>air</b> <b>starts</b> of 40 percent were successful at 200 knots at altitudes up to 10, 650 m and at 175 knots at altitudes up to 6100 m.

Using the group 1 start schedule, based on a 40 sec timer, an air speed of 300 knots was required to ensure successful 40 and 25 % BUC mode spooldown airstarts.

The results were validated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of PTh deposits obtained onto SnO 2 coated glass, following a potential pulse program. Besides of corroborating the electropolymerization model, this study suggested the possibility of designing and performing suitable experiments leading to the attainment of electro-deposited conductive polymers bearing a desired morphology, appropriated for prospective applications...|$|R
