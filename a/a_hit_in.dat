5|$|A {{home run}} is <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> <b>in</b> which the player reaches home plate, and scores {{a run on}} the same play without being called out. Most often in modern baseball, this occurs when a player hits the ball over the outfield wall in fair territory. However, it can occur on a ball hit to the outfield with a fast runner when the ball does not leave the field of play; this is called an inside-the-park home run. Home-run hitters are often likely to be larger, slower players due to their strength, {{and may not be}} fast enough to {{complete}} the triple. The MLB single-season and all-time leader in home runs is Barry Bonds, who hit 73 home runs in the 2001 season and notched 762 in his 22-season career. Bonds never hit for the cycle. The highest on the list to do so is Alex Rodriguez (fourth all-time; 696 home runs as of January 16, 2017), who hit for the cycle on June 5, 1997.|$|E
