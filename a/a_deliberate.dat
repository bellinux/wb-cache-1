5|$|Sherman {{captured}} {{the state capital}} of Columbia, South Carolina, on February 17, 1865. Fires began that night and by next morning most of the central city was destroyed. The burning of Columbia has engendered controversy ever since, with some claiming the fires were accidental, others <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> act of vengeance, and still others that the retreating Confederates burned bales of cotton {{on their way out}} of town.|$|E
5|$|The {{possible}} {{reasons for the}} clipping of coins are controversial.

5|$|Following <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> {{break from}} media scrutiny, Williams {{released}} his seventh album Rudebox in October 2006 to great public anticipation. Despite a lukewarm critical reception, it matched the chart success of its predecessors, becoming Williams' seventh album {{in a row}} to reach {{number one in the}} United Kingdom and spawning the UK number-four single of the same name. The album, however, sold far fewer copies in the UK than his record label EMI had predicted.|$|E

5|$|Located in {{the bottom}} of a narrow valley, the Nine Stones circle has a {{diameter}} of 9.1 metres by 7.8 metres (29 feet 10 inches by 25 feet 11 inches). It consists of nine irregularly spaced sarsen megaliths, with a small opening on its northern side. Two of the stones on the north-western side of the monument are considerably larger than the other seven. This architectural feature has parallels with various stone circles in south-western Scotland, and was potentially <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> choice of the circle's builders, to whom it may have had symbolic meaning.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a raiding party {{attacked}} Williams Station, a Pony Express station {{located on}} the Carson River near present-day Lake Lahontan. One account says the raid was <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> attempt to provoke war. Another says the raiders had heard that men at the station had kidnapped two Paiute women, and fighting broke out {{when they went to}} investigate and free the women. Either way, the war party killed five men and the station was burned.|$|E
5|$|Swiftsure {{had taken}} {{significant}} damage to its masts, rigging and sails during {{the exchange of}} fire, <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> ploy by the French captains to limit the ship's movement and prevent its escape. This had minimised casualties on deck by distracting the gunfire, {{and as a result}} only two men were killed and eight wounded, two of whom subsequently also died. French losses were more severe, with four casualties on Indivisible and six killed and 23 wounded on Dix-Août, although neither ship was significantly damaged in the action.|$|E

5|$|The Tribal Hidage {{is a list}} of thirty-five {{tribes that}} was {{compiled}} in Anglo-Saxon England some time between the 7th and 9th centuries. It includes a number of independent kingdoms and other smaller territories and assigns a number of hides to each one. The list of tribes is headed by Mercia and consists almost exclusively of peoples who lived south of the Humber estuary and territories that surrounded the Mercian kingdom, some of which have never been satisfactorily identified by scholars. The value of 100,000 hides for Wessex is by far the largest: {{it has been suggested that}} this was <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> exaggeration.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} of Dreadnought coincided with increasing {{tension between the}} United Kingdom and Germany. Germany had begun to build a large battlefleet in the 1890s, as part of <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> policy to challenge British naval supremacy. With {{the conclusion of the}} Entente Cordiale between the United Kingdom and France in April 1904, it became increasingly clear that the United Kingdom's principal naval enemy would be Germany, which was building up a large, modern fleet under the 'Tirpitz' laws. This rivalry gave rise to the two largest dreadnought fleets of the pre-war period.|$|E
5|$|The {{first round}} was {{broadcast}} February 14, 2011, {{and the second}} round, on February 15, 2011. The right to choose the first category had been determined by a draw won by Rutter. Watson, represented by a computer monitor display and artificial voice, responded correctly to the second clue and then selected the fourth clue of the first category, <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> strategy to find the Daily Double as quickly as possible. Watson's guess at the Daily Double location was correct. At {{the end of the}} first round, Watson was tied with Rutter at $5,000; Jennings had $2,000.|$|E

5|$|The {{net effect}} of the Dutch {{campaign}} was a pax Hollandica (Dutch peace), assuring VOC control in the southwest of the island. The Dutch called their new area of control the Verenigde Dorpen (United Villages), <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> allusion to the United Provinces of their homeland. The campaign was vital to the success and growth of the Dutch colony, which had operated {{as more of a}} trading post than a true colony until that point.|$|E
5|$|The non-appearance of Monteverdi's promised {{explanatory}} treatise {{may have}} been <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> ploy, since by 1608, by Monteverdi's reckoning, Artusi had become fully reconciled to modern trends in music, and the seconda pratica was by then well established; Monteverdi {{had no need to}} revisit the issue. On the other hand, letters to Giovanni Battista Doni of 1632 show that Monteverdi was still preparing a defence of the seconda practica, in a treatise entitled Melodia; he may still have been working on this {{at the time of his}} death ten years later.|$|E
5|$|The prose, while simple at {{the level}} of the {{sentence}} (and we can safely assume that Hofmann's translation is very faithful to the original), is shifty, blurred, to the point where at times we are left unsure as to what exactly is going on – <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> flight from causation, quite understandable in a country where everyone (even, we learn, the horses) has been driven mad by fear.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{theories}} about why the hoard was buried. One is that the hoard represented <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> attempt to keep wealth safe, perhaps in response to one of the many upheavals facing Roman Britain in the early fifth century. This is not the only hypothesis, however. Archaeologist Peter Guest argues that the hoard was buried because the items in it were used as part of a system of gift-exchange, and as Britain separated from the Roman Empire, they were no longer required. A third hypothesis is that the Hoxne Hoard represents the proceeds of a robbery, buried to avoid detection.|$|E
5|$|Tonelli {{retired after}} the Games. His aquatic success was not derived from any {{physical}} advantage, {{as he was}} relatively small for a swimmer. He was only 185cm tall and weighed 70kg, with relatively small hands and feet. Tonelli felt that his success was based around his ability to make fast starts from the blocks, and attributed his success to his mental approach {{and his ability to}} convert his energy into a fast swim in under one minute. He had <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> strategy of making himself nervous before the race, feeling that he thrived on pressure.|$|E
5|$|A lull {{probably}} occurred {{early in}} the afternoon, and a break for rest and food {{would probably have been}} needed. William may have also needed time to implement a new strategy, which may have been inspired by the English pursuit and subsequent rout by the Normans. If the Normans could send their cavalry against the shield wall and then draw the English into more pursuits, breaks in the English line might form. William of Poitiers says the tactic was used twice. Although arguments have been made that the chroniclers' accounts of this tactic were meant to excuse the flight of the Norman troops from battle, this is unlikely as the earlier flight was not glossed over. It was a tactic used by other Norman armies during the period. Some historians have argued that the story of the use of feigned flight as <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> tactic was invented after the battle; most historians agree that it was used by the Normans at Hastings.|$|E
