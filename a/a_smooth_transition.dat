5|$|On 25October, the {{division}} was broken up and all troops {{were transferred to}} Special Force. Symes, despite his seniority, became Wingate's second-in-command and tried to prevent the further break-up of {{the division}}al units to retain the traditions, histories and esprit de corps of the British Army's regimental structure, which reconciled his men and helped to ensure <b>a</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>transition</b> to Special Force. Having ceased to exist, the 70th Division was officially disbanded on 24 November.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} episodes {{of the eighth}} season, as Andy Griffith was {{preparing}} to leave, the character Sam Jones, played by Ken Berry, was introduced as the new star, and the series was reitled Mayberry R.F.D.. Most of the cast members continued their original roles, with Bavier becoming Sam's housekeeper. To create <b>a</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>transition,</b> Andy and Helen were married in the first episode with the new title and remained for a few additional episodes before leaving with a move to Raleigh, effectively ending their appearances. After RFDs cancellation in 1971, George Lindsey played Goober for many years on the popular country-variety show Hee Haw.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, it is {{possible}} that Livia did supply a poisoned fig (she did cultivate a variety of fig named for her that Augustus is said to have enjoyed), but did so as a means of assisted suicide rather than murder. Augustus' health had been in decline in the months immediately before his death, and he had made significant preparations for <b>a</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>transition</b> in power, having at last reluctantly settled on Tiberius as his choice of heir. It is likely that Augustus was not expected to return alive from Nola, but it seems that his health improved once there; it has therefore been speculated that Augustus and Livia conspired to end his life at the anticipated time, having committed all political process to accepting Tiberius, in order to not endanger that transition.|$|E
5|$|Muren {{found both}} stop motion and optical effects {{to be too}} {{technically}} challenging and decided that the transformation scene would be a perfect opportunity for ILM to create advances with digital morphing technology. He proposed filming each animal, and the actress doubling for Hayes, and then feeding the images into a computer program developed by Doug Smythe. The program would then create <b>a</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>transition</b> from one stage to another before outputting the result back onto film. Smythe began development of the necessary software in September 1987. By March 1988, the impressive result Muren and fellow designer David Allen achieved what would represent a breakthrough for computer-generated imagery (CGI). The head of ILM's animation department, Wes Takahashi, supervised the film's animation sequences.|$|E

5|$|On 28 July 1943, {{strike and}} bomber {{production}} {{was to be}} scaled down, and fighter and bomber destroyer production given priority. On 3 August 1943, Milch contradicted this and declared that this increase in fighter production would not affect production of the Ju 87, Ju 188, Ju 288 and Ju 290. This was an important consideration as the life expectancy of a Ju 87 had been reduced (since 1941) from 9.5 months to 5.5 months to just 100 operational flying hours. On 26 October, General der Schlachtflieger Ernst Kupfer reported the Ju 87 could no longer survive in operations and that the Focke-Wulf Fw 190F should take its place. Milch finally agreed and ordered the minimal continuance of Ju 87 D-3 and D-5 production for <b>a</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>transition</b> period.|$|E

5000|$|When {{shifting}} properly, {{the driver}} [...] "shifts" [...] to another gear and then releases {{pressure on the}} clutch pedal to re-engage the engine to the driveshaft. If the pedal is released quickly, a definite lurch can be felt as the engine and driveshaft re-engage and their speeds equalize. However, if the clutch is released slowly the clutch disc will [...] "slip" [...] against the flywheel; this friction permits the engine <b>a</b> <b>smoother</b> <b>transition</b> to its new rotation speed. Such routine slippage causes wear on the clutch analogous to the wear-and-tear on a brake pad when stopping. Some amount of wear is unavoidable, but with better clutching/shifting technique it can be minimized by releasing the clutch {{as close to the}} correct engine speed for the gear and vehicle speed as possible. When upshifting, this will involve allowing the engine speed to fall. Conversely, when downshifting, increasing the engine speed with the accelerator prior to releasing clutch will result in <b>a</b> <b>smoother</b> <b>transition</b> and minimal clutch wear.|$|R
