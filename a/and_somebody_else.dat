500|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} his car, Martin felt the {{championship}} was an achievement {{that he was}} unable to secure: [...] "They tell me {{a lot of people are}} having trouble anyway, but we didn't need to throw that away," [...] He said he was unaware that Yeley intended to make a pit stop and, from his viewpoint, it allowed Kenseth to pass him while Yeley was coming from the centre of the track. Yeley said the pit stop was planned and signalled his intentions to Martin for over a mile. He felt Martin placed him in a position to hit the backstretch wall. Hamlin said the first-lap crash that he was involved in was part of auto racing, and stated it was problematic being involved in difficulties in the Chase for the Nextel Cup: [...] "We checked up <b>and</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> (Waltrip) didn't. I put myself back there in qualifying. We'll take our lumps and go on." [...] Seventh-place finisher Raines was happy to hold the first position for 28 laps saying it was [...] "extra special" [...] to lead a race at Charlotte. Tom Bowles of Frontstretch opined that had the caution flag not been displayed for the three safety vehicles on lap nine, it could have resulted in [...] "one of the most disastrous accidents in NASCAR history." ...|$|E

2500|$|Christian Bale denied {{rumors that}} he was {{approached}} for {{a role to play}} Solid Snake in the film. However, on January 11, 2010, de Luca confirmed that work on a Metal Gear film adaptation was postponed indefinitely. He said Konami expressed concern that the entire Metal Gear franchise could be seriously affected if a movie version performed poorly. In March 2012, during The Art of Video Games exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Hideo Kojima stated, [...] "Honestly, I'm a movie fan and that's very special to me. I honestly would love to make a movie someday, but that said, I {{think it has to be}} a certain special game that has to provide that right setting. But I don't think that game will be Metal Gear Solid. Metal Gear Solid was developed specifically to become a game. ...If it were to be made into a movie it would have to be something completely new. I wouldn't use my current scripts. I think I'd have to get somebody to get a new script <b>and</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> to direct it as a movie." [...] At the Metal Gear 25th Anniversary on August 30, 2012, Hideo Kojima announced that Arad Productions, owned by Arad brothers Avi and Ari, have agreed to produce a movie version of Metal Gear Solid with Columbia Pictures. Columbia's parent company, Sony Pictures Entertainment, will be in charge of distribution. On June 3, 2014, Deadline reported that Sony are eyeing Jordan Vogt-Roberts to direct the film. On March 30, 2015, Sony Pictures announced that Jay Basu will write the screenplay. In February 2017, Vogt-Roberts said the filmmakers are working on the film's script with Kojima and making it either an R or a PG-13 film rating.|$|E
