5|$|McCulloch met former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr in 1993 {{and they}} wrote and {{recorded}} an album, tentatively titled Touch Down. The album {{was to be}} released in early 1994; however, despite McCulloch and Marr being happy with the album, Rob Dickins at WEA felt it was missing some element. Dickins suggested to McCulloch that Sergeant be brought in to do some work. McCulloch was initially sceptical because he had not spoken with Sergeant since de Freitas's funeral; however, he did give the idea some thought. Before McCulloch had chance to contact Sergeant, a mutual friend persuaded the pair to meet socially. While McCulloch and Sergeant were being reacquainted, the tapes from the McCulloch and Marr sessions disappeared. McCulloch was not upset <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> he and Sergeant had started working together as Electrafixion.|$|E
25|$|Gilchrist {{was said}} to be one of only four bowlers ever to have {{actually}} hit the sightscreen after first bounce on the pitch, on the full. (There is some doubt <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> <b>as</b> the scorebook for the match in question, however, showed only three extras).|$|E
25|$|With an {{operational}} system now online, tactical considerations were developed. The first was airborne radar sets, installed on fighters. German pilots complained <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> it created drag {{and reduced the}} performance of their aircraft. They preferred to acquire the target visually once ground control had guided them onto the bomber stream. A second change involved the removal of AAA installations and searchlights from the line and grouping them around cities for their defence.|$|E

25|$|On 14 August, it was {{reported}} that Fernandes had flown to the Merseyside to complete the deal after being left out of the squad in Benfica's game, and he attended Everton's match against Blackburn 11 days later. Adding to the fact the player's rights were partly owned by an agency, the Premier League did not agree to the transfer as Everton would only half-own the player's contract – the English were not too happy <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> the league had previously let Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano move to other clubs under the same agreements.|$|E
25|$|The special {{property}} of entanglement {{can be better}} observed if we separate the said two particles. Let's put {{one of them in}} the White House in Washington and the other in UC Berkeley (think <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a thought experiment, not an actual one). Now, if we measure a particular characteristic of one of these particles (say, for example, spin), get a result, and then measure the other particle using the same criterion (spin along the same axis), we find that the result of the measurement of the second particle will match (in a complementary sense) the result of the measurement of the first particle, in that they will be opposite in their values.|$|E
25|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this approach}} is that it is trivial, based on the trivial observation that mathematics is a human activity. To observe that rigorous proof comes only after unrigorous conjecture, experimentation and speculation is true, but it is trivial and no-one would deny this. So it's a bit of a stretch to characterize a philosophy of mathematics in this way, on something trivially true. The calculus of Leibniz and Newton was reexamined by mathematicians such as Weierstrass in order to rigorously prove the theorems thereof. There is nothing special or interesting <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> <b>as</b> it fits in with the more general trend of unrigorous ideas which are later made rigorous. There needs to be a clear distinction between the objects of study of mathematics and the study of the objects of study of mathematics. The former doesn't seem to change a great deal; the latter is forever in flux. The latter is what the social theory is about, and the former is what Platonism et al. are about.|$|E

500|$|At the time, {{a career}} in music in Ukraine meant having an {{unstable}} income, causing Leontovych to seek employment wherever he could find it. Leontovych worked in Kiev, Yekaterinoslav, and Podolia guberniyas {{over the next few}} years in order to remain gainfully employed. His first position after graduating was in a secondary school in the village of Chukiv (present-day Vinnytsia Oblast) as a vocal and math teacher. During this time Leontovych continued to transcribe and arrange folk songs. He completed his [...] "First compilation of songs from Podolia" [...] and began working on his second compilation. He also inspired the children at the school to sing in the choir and play in the orchestra. He would later write a book <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a professor at the Kiev Conservatory, titled [...] "Як я організував оркестр у сільській школі" [...] (How I organized an orchestra in a village school).|$|E
500|$|The schism continued, {{with the}} {{national}} AIM leadership claiming that the local AIM leaders, such as Churchill, are tools of the U.S. government used against other American Indians. The leaders of the national AIM organization, now called AIM Grand Governing Council, claim that Churchill {{has worked in the}} past as an underground counter-intelligence source for the U.S. government, for example the FBI, and local, non-Indian, police forces, to subvert the national AIM organization. Specifically, they refer to a 1993 Boulder, Colorado interview with Jodi Rave, a former columnist for the Denver Post, in which Churchill stated that he [...] "was teaching the Rapid City Police Department about the American Indian Movement." [...] In addition, Vernon Bellecourt accused Churchill of having 'fraudulently represented himself as an Indian' to bolster his credentials. Bellecourt said he complained to the University of Colorado <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> early as 1986.|$|E
500|$|Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) has tasked Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{with finding}} a {{part-time}} replacement for Jim Halpert (John Krasinski). Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) is concerned <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> <b>as</b> Jim's replacement {{will be her}} new [...] "deskmate". Clark Green (Clark Duke) feels he {{is ready for the}} position, citing his key role in various sales, but Dwight wants someone who he can be sure will not team up with Pam against him. To that end, he brings in a bizarre gallery of his relatives and close friends, including his cousin Mose (Michael Schur), best friend Rolf (James Urbaniak), part-time private investigator Trevor (Chris Gethard), former Corporate executive Troy Undercook (Noel Petok), and his karate teacher Sensei Ira (Lance Krall). To Dwight's horror, though, none of his candidates are competent enough to even make it through the full job interview, much less be paper salesmen. Clark ends his interview after answering Dwight's complicated questions perfectly, pointing out that he {{has no choice but to}} hire him if he wants someone who can do the job.|$|E

2500|$|In late 2006 {{or early}} 2007, in what {{journalist}} Seymour Hersh called The Redirection, the United States changed its {{policy in the}} Muslim world, shifting its support from the Shia to the Sunni, {{with the goal of}} [...] "containing" [...] Iran and as a by-product bolstering Sunni extremist groups. Richard Engel, who is an NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent, wrote an article in late 2011 alleging that the United States Government is pro-Sunni and anti-Shia. During the Iraq War, the United States feared that a Shiite-led, Iran-friendly Iraq could have major consequences for American national security. However, nothing can be done <b>about</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> Iraq's Shiite government were democratically elected. Shadi Bushra of Stanford University wrote that the United States’ support of the Sunni monarchy during the Bahraini uprising {{is the latest in a}} long history of US support to keep the Shiites in check. The United States fears that Shiite rule in the Persian Gulf will lead to anti-US and anti-Western sentiment as well as Iranian influence in the Arab majority states.
