25|$|In {{the sixth}} year of her {{confinement}} in the sanatorium Madonna’s younger brother Orby, {{who also had}} tuberculosis, died. He had begged his sister to have their parents take him home from the sanatorium {{so that he could}} die at home. He was taken home and died later the same day. After being denied the opportunity to attend her brother’s funeral, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> dying in the sanatorium added to Madonna’s desire to leave, which she did without permission and returned to her family home. Facing the threat of quarantine her father refused to return Madonna to the Indian sanatorium. Instead he wrote to an old school friend, Henry Standing Bear, who advised them to see a doctor in Pierre and gain admittance to the “white” TB sanatorium, Sanator at Custer, SD. This was not simple, again due to discrimination because they were Indians the authorities denied her admittance to Sanator, telling them that they {{had to go back to}} the Sioux San. Madonna’s father James Hart Swan would not accept this denial and he gained an audience with the governor of South Dakota, Judge Sigurd Anderson. James Swam explained their situation and the governor, who considered himself somewhat of a pioneer for human rights, understood that American Indians were not treated fairly, arranged for Madonna to be admitted to Sanator.|$|E

500|$|While Eliot {{acknowledged}} that the passage in The Waste Land beginning [...] "Who is the third who walks always beside you" [...] was a reference to an early Antarctic expedition of explorer Ernest Shackleton, scholars have seen connections to the appearance of Jesus to two of his disciples walking on the Road to Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35). However, Alan Shucard indicates a possible link to Whitman, and a passage in the fourteenth strophe [...] "with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me, / <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> death close-walking {{the other side of}} me, / And I in the middle with companions" [...] (lines 121–123).|$|E
500|$|Despite Shatner's doubts, Nimoy and Bennett {{selected}} a time travel {{story in which}} the Enterprise crew encounters a problem {{that could only be}} fixed by something only available in the present day (the Star Trek characters' past). They considered ideas about violin makers and oil drillers, or a disease that had its cure destroyed with the rainforests. [...] "But the depiction of thousands of sick and dying people seemed rather gruesome for our light-hearted film, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> our crew taking a 600-year round trip just to bring back a snail darter wasn't all that thrilling," [...] explained Nimoy. The director read a book on extinct animals and conceived the storyline that was eventually adopted. Nimoy hit upon the idea of humpback whales after talking with a friend—their song added mystery to the story, and their size added logistical challenges the heroes would have to overcome.|$|E
500|$|Knowles {{commented on}} the song, [...] "It's energetic, {{aggressive}} and filled with hard beats".

If you're in a relationship, even if the man's cheating and you end up not wanting him, the thought of another woman benefiting from the lessons you taught him." [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] features Knowles as the female protagonist impersonating a threatened woman involved in a love triangle. She is unwilling to allow another woman to profit from all the efforts she put on to make her lover a better man. Frances Romero of Time magazine noted that Knowles' anger is due to her man's wandering eye, her desire to leave, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> having to give him up to some unworthy woman.|$|E

In the process, he lost a year at school, but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies. His wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their marriage, he once said, [...] "As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives." [...] However, as was prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband. Writing many years later, Mohandas described with regret the lustful feelings he felt for his young bride, [...] "even at school I used to think of her, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me." [...] He later recalled feeling jealous and possessive of her, such as when she would visit a temple with her girlfriends, and being sexually lustful in his feelings for her.|$|E

2500|$|Common {{themes in}} his thought can, however, be {{identified}} and discussed. His earliest work emphasized the opposition of Apollonian and Dionysian impulses in art, and the figure of Dionysus continued {{to play a role}} in his subsequent thought. Other major currents include the will to power, the claim that God is dead, the distinction between master and slave moralities, and radical perspectivism. Other concepts appear rarely, or are confined to one or two major works, yet are considered centerpieces of Nietzschean philosophy, such as the Übermensch <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> eternal recurrence. His later works involved a sustained attack on Christianity and Christian morality, and he seemed to be working toward what he called the transvaluation of all values (Umwertung aller Werte). [...] While Nietzsche is often associated in the public mind with fatalism and nihilism, Nietzsche himself viewed his project as the attempt to overcome the pessimism of Arthur Schopenhauer.|$|E

On May 9, 1936, she attended a play in which a geisha attacks her lover with a large knife, after which she decided to threaten Ishida with a knife at their next meeting. On May 11, 1936, Abe pawned some of her clothing and used the money to buy a kitchen knife. She later described meeting Ishida that night, [...] "I pulled the kitchen knife out of my bag and threatened him as had been done in the play I had seen, saying, 'Kichi, you wore that kimono just to please one of your favorite customers.

2500|$|Pallis' translation, however, {{while still}} subject {{to all the}} old criticisms that had been {{directed}} at the Queen's work, also attracted new kinds of political, linguistic and personal attack. [...] His long residence in the British Empire aroused suspicions of British influence, and his adopted British nationality laid him open to the accusation of being a traitor, [...] "one who had no patrida". [...] British influence in itself {{would not have been}} too threatening, since Britain had always been a reliable supporter of the young Greek state; but the British were predominantly Protestant, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> a Protestant 'foreign finger' awoke memories of the 1830s threat from the missionary societies that had brought about the ban on Bible translations in the first place. [...] Although Pallis was an Orthodox believer, he had certainly [...] "developed anti-clerical leanings and had come to believe that the sacred texts of Christianity should be available to all people in their own language for their own private study." [...] (Mackridge 2009 p.247) [...] To the Orthodox Church, these seemed suspiciously similar to Protestant views, coming as they did from a British citizen.|$|E
