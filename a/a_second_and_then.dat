5|$|Edwards' actions alienated those Native Americans {{friendly}} to the U.S. in the region. Ninian Edwards, having lost {{the confidence of the}} Madison administration, waited out the war in Kentucky. However, he was reappointed to <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> a third term as territorial governor in 1812 and 1815, and he was also named one of the three U.S. negotiators of the Treaties of Portage des Sioux in 1815.|$|E
500|$|Webb {{stated that}} he and the crew wanted to keep the stunts more {{grounded}} physically, a challenge for a superhuman character. The stunt performers included the Armstrong family, Vic and Andy, along with Richard Norton who plays a SWAT team member. Andy Armstrong was the stunt coordinator while Vic was the second unit director. To determine how Spider-Man should swing, Andy videotaped an Olympic Games gymnast swinging on a horizontal bar. Andy noted that in the computer-generated swing in the earlier Spider-Man films, [...] "he swings down at the same speed as he swings up," [...] and this [...] "constant" [...] speed is unlike a real gymnast's movement where [...] "he's accelerating until he reaches the bottom, then as he starts to come up, he's decelerating until he gets to the top of his swing and he actually gets negative gravity, where he'll go weightless for <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the next swing starts, and it becomes another violent swing again." [...] Vic felt that Spider-Man's moves were comparable to those of Tarzan, and he wanted to add that in the film. While filming in New York City, they swung a man through traffic down the street. Then, while the crew built a rig hundreds of feet long over Riverside Drive in Harlem, Andy built a car rig with a series of wires to help with effects which Webb said required an [...] "incredible wealth of acrobatics". These rigs were over 200â€“300 feet long and demanded months of rehearsals and design. According to Andy, operating the rigs [...] "was a combination of a lot of human skills and mechanical engineering." [...] The purpose of the rigs was to depict Spider-Man's swing in a way that wasn't computer-generated. Garfield was reported to be involved with some of the stunts. Leaked pictures reveal Garfield with a nosebleed that reports claimed was from swinging. Arad explained that [...] "Andrew is not only a brilliant actor but he is a sportsman. This gave us the opportunity to try things with him that were it not so it would have been almost impossible." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a post-show {{interview}} clip on Austin City Limits, guitarist Munaf Rayani {{said about}} {{their status as}} instrumentalists, [...] "I mean, I think we discussed singing for half <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> it just kinda, we just dropped it. We just didn't go back to it because we were comfortable enough." [...] Drummer Chris Hrasky added, [...] "I think we just {{liked the idea of}} a band that there was not a leader or main songwriter, everyone sort of collaborating and has their own say. I don't think any of us want the sort of 'leader role', so a leaderless band is kind of the best option for us." ...|$|E

60|$|The sand {{began to}} work, and {{presently}} {{a small black}} bug appeared for <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> darted under again in a fright.|$|E
6000|$|And then {{he stopped}} suddenly. Pomona also stood for <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> she made a dash at the child, and {{snatched}} it up. Gazing sharply at its tear-smeared countenance, she exclaimed, [...] "What's this?" ...|$|E
60|$|Amy turned deadly pale, stood {{speechless}} for <b>a</b> few <b>seconds,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> fainted in her friend's arms.|$|R
60|$|The nurse {{bent over}} the girl for <b>a</b> few <b>seconds,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> drew the sheet over her face. It covered a corpse.|$|R

6000|$|Torrance {{considered}} for <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> smiled significantly as {{he glanced at}} his daughter's face. [...] "Well, you would be 'most as safe down there--and I guess it was born in you," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{yet there}} was somebody!" [...] She pouted her lips at him, glancing up into his face for half <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> again hung her head down. [...] "Mary, do not grudge me my delight." ...|$|E
60|$|As he spoke, the senator's son fired, and {{the bullet}} from his pistol hit the wolf in the side. The beast {{staggered}} for <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> kept on, still carrying the sheep in its strong teeth.|$|E
60|$|Yuba Bill {{swallowed}} {{the glass of}} whiskey at a gulp, wiped his mouth <b>and</b> eyes, smothered <b>a</b> <b>second</b> explosion, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> gravely confronted Brice.|$|R
60|$|The prize-fighter stood glaring for <b>a</b> few <b>seconds,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> {{rather to}} the {{surprise}} of Flambeau and the others, strode out, sending the door to with a crash behind him.|$|R

60|$|Seaforth {{wondered}} whether his comrade saw the wickedness {{in the other}} man's face, and the slight closing of his hands upon the bridle. It was very perceptible for <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> he made a gesture of resignation.|$|E
60|$|A {{minute later}} came a fierce gust of wind, {{followed}} by <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> a third. Around spun the biplane and then tilted {{up as if}} about to go over. Then came an unexpected ripping and tearing sound.|$|E
60|$|As Carthoris, Xodar, Tars Tarkas, and I stood {{gazing at}} the {{magnificent}} vessel which {{meant so much to}} all of us, we saw <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> a third top the summit of the hills and glide gracefully after their sister.|$|E
60|$|Undaunted by this threat, Tom {{mounted the}} stairs two steps at a time. As {{he did so}} he heard Merrick go up <b>a</b> <b>second</b> flight <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> third.|$|R
6000|$|MacIan {{looked at}} the grass frowningly for <b>a</b> few <b>seconds,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> said in <b>a</b> new, small and childish voice: [...] "I am awfully stupid, Mr. Turnbull; you must be patient with me." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{waited for}} <b>a</b> few <b>seconds</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> whistled once more. Was he mistaken, or did an {{answering}} whistle sound out? He could not tell. He set his face grimly and trudged on.|$|R
6000|$|Sackville only {{replied that}} he did not see his way to doing so. <b>A</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> a third officer were sent to him, with a like result, and at last he himself left his cavalry and rode to the duke and inquired: ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{went off}} {{down to the}} river, {{studying}} over this thing, and pretty soon I noticed that my nigger was following along behind. When we {{was out of sight}} of the house he looked back and around <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> comes a-running, and says: ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Smith {{turned his}} head and looked at the divide for half <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> said he had crossed a worse one up north back of the Wahnipitae and that the flies were Hades,--and then went on playing freezeout poker with the two juniors in Duff's bank.|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't {{worry about}} that," [...] was the cheerful answer. [...] "Things are going {{just about as}} well as they could. There'll be <b>a</b> <b>second</b> adjournment, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> perhaps another." ...|$|R
60|$|The Rover boys waited <b>a</b> few <b>seconds</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> {{knocked on}} {{the back door of}} the cottage. The farm hand, a fellow named Dan Murdock, stamped over to the door and threw it open.|$|R
60|$|At {{this stage}} in the elucidation of the knotty point, Bluenose {{observed}} that his pipe was going out, so he paused, pulled at it vigorously for <b>a</b> few <b>seconds,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> resumed his discourse.|$|R
60|$|Down, down, down he sailed {{and landed}} on his feet. Of course, he hit the ground pretty hard, and {{for just a second}} he quite lost his breath.

60|$|Jinks {{generally}} fancied {{himself a}} submarine and Blinks acted {{the part of}} a first-class battleship. Jinks would pop his periscope out of the water, take a look at Blinks merely for the fraction of <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> like a flash, would dive under water again and start firing his torpedoes. He explained that he carried six.|$|E
6000|$|... "That will be {{the true}} service. For though he has sent me a gallant adversary for the first, the thought in Mr. Simon's mind is merely murder.

6000|$|... "Just {{wait and}} I'll {{tell you all}} about it--maybe." [...] <b>And</b> <b>then</b> Spouter stopped short, struck by a sudden idea. He thought for <b>a</b> few <b>seconds</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> his face broke into a broad smile.|$|R
