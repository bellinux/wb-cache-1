This very Autumn, hearing that the Crown-Prince and his Princess fancied Reinsberg; an old Castle in their Amt Ruppin, some miles north of them,--his Majesty, without word spoken, straightway purchased Reinsberg, Schloss and Territory, from the owner; gave it to his Crown-Prince, and gave him money to new-build it according to his mind.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{rewriting}} logic based technique for defining the formal executable semantics of a non-autonomous Petri net class, named Input-Output Place/Transition nets (IOPT nets), designed for model-based embedded system’s development, {{according to the}} MDA initiative. For this purpose, we provide model-to-model transformations from ecore IOPT models to a rewriting logic specification in Maude. The transformations are defined as semantic mappings based on the respective metamodels: the IOPT metamodel and the Maude metamodel. Also, we define model to-text transformations for the generation of the model execution code in the rewriting logic framework. Hence, we present a translational semantics composed by two components: (i) the denotational one, considering as semantic domains the operations, equations, and properties that specify the Petri net structure, signals, and events according to the commutative monoid view; and (ii) the operational one, that changes the interleaving semantics of Maude using rewriting rules specified at the Maude metalevel to provide a maximal step semantics for transitions with arcs, test arcs, and priorities. Additionally, this work gives <b>architectural</b> <b>advices</b> in order to compose new semantics specifications by simple component substitution. Due to its simulation and verification capabilities for control systems, the presented work was applied to a domotic project that intends to save energy in residential buildings...|$|R

50|$|In 1911, {{the house}} was {{purchased}} by SPNEA, its first <b>architectural</b> acquisition. With <b>advice</b> from restoration architect Henry Charles Dean, SPNEA removed layers of lath and plaster to reveal original timbers, early 18th-century paneling, {{and one of the}} largest fireplaces in New England. Restoration stopped when funds were exhausted, before any long-gone original features like diamond-paned casements were recreated, resulting in a house with an unrestored 18th-century exterior and a partially restored interior reflecting both the 17th and early 18th centuries. After restoration, {{the house was}} rented to a series of tenants, who operated a tea room there until 1965 when the house became a study museum.|$|R

40|$|Neil is a sporty, outdoorsy sort of bloke. He spends verylittle time at home, {{preferring to}} golf, surf, {{go to the}} footy and hang out with his mates: You can tell just by looking inside his house—a huge TV in the darkened lounge, and golf equipment, surf boards and {{motorbike}} gear fill up the room. That was before last October. Now, in June, Neil is a paraplegic, his house is inaccessible and his boys-toys are in the way. For Neil, his home, previously an inwardly focused place to sleep and store, will become the centre of his world (when he can eventually get into it). Initially, accessibility is the key problem to be solved. To this end the architectural advisor from the rehabilitation unit proposed formulaic adjustments {{to the bathroom to}} allow for wheelchair access. However, accessibility is only one facet of the problem. This environment, relatively unimportant before,now needs to enable and inspire the occupant both physically and emotionally. As physical abilities dramatically change the spatial practices of everyday life also change. The home environment is ever more important to support and help heal emotional scarring after a life-changing event. In the context of shorter hospital and rehabilitation stays,the home provides a vital extension to the healthcare system. Therefore it is important that <b>architectural</b> <b>advice</b> given to enable this move considers the holistic qualities ofdesign thinking rather than be restricted to short-term solutions...|$|E
40|$|The 2 nd author's {{contribution}} consists {{mainly of}} <b>architectural</b> and algorithmic <b>advice</b> regarding {{the design and}} implementation of the system presented in this paper. The algorithmic suggestions are inspired from the 2 nd author's experience with participating in various algorithmic programming contests (examples of several tasks and solutions from such contests {{can be found in the}} attached zip archive). International audienceIn this paper we propose a new strategy that can be applied for creating a secure peer-to-peer topology in which the identity of the source node cannot be revealed. The main goal is to obtain a decentralized network distributed in space, where the users are allowed to share and exchange their music files. The proposed model uses different metrics for estimating the distance between nodes (like the round trip time and the semantic distance) and uses the smallest values in order to select a node's neighbors. For the identity protection, the system imposes the encryption of the traffic and that the communication is mediated by a node from the network, randomly chosen by each instance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. AS {{complexity}} of computational applications and their environments has been increased {{due to the}} heterogeneity of resources; complexity, continuous changes of the applications {{as well as the}} resources states, and the large number of resources involved, the importance of problem solving environments has been more emphasized. As a PSE for metacomputing environment, Adaptive Distributed Computing Environment (ADViCE) has been developed before the emergence of Grid computing services. Current runtime systems for computing mainly focus on executing applications with static resource configuration and do not adequately change the configuration of application execution environments dynamically to optimize the application performance. In this paper, we present an <b>architectural</b> overview of <b>ADViCE</b> and discuss how it is evolving to incorporate Grid computing services to extend its range of services and decrease the cost of development, deployment, execution and maintenance for an application. We provide that ADViCE optimize the application execution at runtime adaptively optimize based on application requirements in both non-Grid and Grid environment with optimal execution options. We have implemented the ADViCE prototype and currently evaluating the prototype and its adaptive services for a larger set of Grid applications. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUnderstanding and {{exploiting}} the future value of existing buildings {{is an opportunity}} for property owners, developers and designers to be sustainable and offer advantages rather than burdens to successiveusers. However, although several assessment methods have been studied to quantifythe future value of buildings, more cases are needed to illustrate their usefulness. Commissioned by theVrijeUniversiteit Brussel's administration we studied the feasibility of the transformation of 352 student residences that have become obsolete. In order to compose a thorough <b>advice,</b> <b>architectural</b> explorations and life cycle assessments have been conducted. This paper reports on the result of Life Cycle Costingon this case in particular. Through Life Cycle Costing, the initial costs of distinct transformation strategies, conventional as well as adaptable, were put in a long term perspective. By combining assessments at element and building level,it was possible to detect the particular value of the residences’ load bearing structure and the conditions under which adaptable building can increase that value. These findings allowed us to formulate straightforward advises in an early project stage. They are useful to both the university's administration and the architectural designers that will be commissioned. Nevertheless, in this paper we alsoexpressthe technical and methodological optimizationthat is necessary...|$|R
