40|$|The {{high cost}} of wheels <b>and</b> <b>rails</b> due to wear and rolling contact fatigue {{is one of the}} main {{problems}} in the railway transport. The values of creepage, sliding distance and wear rate of wheels <b>and</b> <b>rails</b> at rolling of a wheel on the rail greatly depend on geometric characteristics of working profiles of wheels <b>and</b> <b>rails</b> <b>and</b> location of wheels relative to rails. In the present work the functional requirements of various parts of profiles of wheels <b>and</b> <b>rails</b> <b>and</b> dominating kinds of their damage in various operating conditions are considered and a new profile of a wheel and device for fastening of rails are offered...|$|R
