The aim {{of the present study}} is to explore the role of peroxynitrite (ONOO-) in <b>aging</b> <b>resistance</b> arterial vasorelaxation dysfunction and the possible mechanism. In the present study, young (3 - 4 months olds) and aging (20 months olds) male SD rats were randomized to receive vehicle (Saline) or FeTMPyP (ONOO- scavenger) for 2 weeks. The vasorelaxation of resistance arteries was determined in vitro; NOx level was tested by a colorimetric assay; the expression of nitrotyrosine (NT), soluble Guanylate Cyclase (sGC), vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), phosphorylated VASP (P-VASP) and cGMP in resistance arteries were detected by immunohistochemical staining. In the present study, endothelium-dependent dilation in <b>aging</b> <b>resistance</b> arteries was lower than in those from young rats (young vs. aging: 68. 0 % ± 4. 5 % vs. 50. 4 % ± 2. 9 %, P< 0. 01). And the endothelium-independent dilation remained constant. Compared with young rats, aging increased nitrative stress in resistance arteries, evidenced by elevated NOx production in serum (5. 3 ± 1. 0 nmol/ml vs. 3. 3 ± 1. 4 nmol/ml, P< 0. 05) and increased NT expression (P< 0. 05). ONOO- was responsible for the vasorelaxation dysfunction, evidenced by normalized vasorelaxation after inhibit ONOO- or its sources (P< 0. 05) and suppressed NT expression after FeTMPyP treatment (P< 0. 05). The expression of sGC was not significantly different between young and <b>aging</b> <b>resistance</b> arteries, but the cGMP level and P-VASP/VASP ratio (biochemical marker of NO-sGC-cGKs signaling) decreased, which was reversed by FeTMPyP treatment in vivo (P< 0. 05).

Nanozirconia ceramics have great potential {{to be used in}} a range of applications from dental implants to petrochemical valves due to their enhanced mechanical properties and superior hydrothermal <b>ageing</b> <b>resistance.</b> Unlike conventional ceramic components that are normally produced in large quantities with low costs using various conventional dry forming or wet forming methods, industry scale processing of nanoceramics has not yet been achieved.

Commercial nanosuspension with a primary particle size of 16 nm was concentrated to 55 wt% solids content using an electrosteric dispersant, β-alanine, whilst retaining low viscosities of ~ 20 mPa s at a 200 s- 1 shear rate.

40|$|The {{influence}} of surface treatment on the low-temperature degradation (LTD) of tetragonal zirconia polycrystalline (TZP) is still unclear. Objectives. The effect of surface treatments on the LTD behavior of zirconia was investigated. Methods. Fully-sintered specimens of seven commercial dental zirconia (Aadva, GC; In-CeramYZ, VITA; IPS e. max ZirCAD, Ivoclar Vivadent; LAVA Frame and LAVA Plus, 3 M ESPE; NANOZR, Panasonic; ZirTough, Kuraray Noritake) {{were provided by}} the manufacturers with specimen dimensions of approximately 10 mm × 5 mm × 3 mm. For each zirconia grade, samples were kept ‘as sintered’ (untreated) or were subjected {{to one of the}} three surface treatments: rough polished, sandblasted with Al 2 O 3, tribochemical silica sandblasted (n = 3 /group). The tetragonal to monoclinic transformation was evaluated by X-ray diffraction at several intervals during LTD testing up to 40 h in steam in an autoclave (134 °C, 2 bar). Results. The five yttria-stabilized TZP (Y-TZP: Aadva, In-CeramYZ, IPS e. max ZirCAD, LAVA Frame, LAVA Plus) zirconia showed a similar trend in LTD behavior. The Al 2 O 3 sandblasted zirconia showed the highest monoclinic volume fraction. The as sintered (untreated) zirconia degraded faster than the surface-treated zirconia. Although the surface-treated ceria-stabilized TZP/alumina (Ce-TZP/Al 2 O 3 : NANOZR) zirconia had a higher initial monoclinic volume fraction compared to the Y-TZP zirconia, it showed a stronger <b>aging</b> <b>resistance.</b> The as sintered (untreated) Y-TZP/alumina (Y-TZP/Al 2 O 3 : ZirTough) zirconia showed a strong <b>aging</b> <b>resistance,</b> whereas the surface-treated Y-TZP/Al 2 O 3 zirconia degraded slightly.

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>age</b> <b>resistance</b> by mice {{has been reported}} {{for a number of}} viral infections including infection wth foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Skinner (1) and Graves and Poppensiek (2) found that mice are rather uniformly susceptible to FMDV until they are approximately 2 weeks old, after which they progressively become resistant. At 5 to 6 weeks of age very few remain susceptible. Although <b>age</b> <b>resistance</b> has been demonstrated many times, the mechanism of this resistance is not clear (3). A number of possibilities have been investigated or suggested including blocking of virus pathways (4 - 7), production of inhibitory substances (8), production of more effective immunological responses with maturation (9, 10), and hormonal effects (11). There is also the possibility that <b>age</b> <b>resistance</b> is related to the production during maturation of cells resistant to virus infection. The studies of Goodman and Koprowski (12) and Kantoch et al. (13) on the association of cell susceptibility to susceptibility of cell donors provide evidence for this hypothesis. Previous to these investigations, Sabin and Olitsky (5) found a relation between intramuscular multiplication of vesicular stomatitis virus and age of the animal, and recently Lerner et al. (14) reported a similar relationship with Coxsackie A 4 virus. Also working with Coxsackie viruses, Kunin (15) obtained evidence which indicated that the susceptibility of animals at various ages was related to the relative amount of receptor-like substances in the tissues. The experiments presented here were performed, therefore, to investigate the possibility of a cellular mechanism for the {{development of}} <b>age</b> <b>resistance</b> to FMDV.

The increased aging stability with increasing Sc 2 O 3 content and the optimum content of 0. 4 - 0. 6 mol% Nd 2 O 3 or 0. 2 - 0. 4 mol% La 2 O 3, resulting in the highest <b>aging</b> <b>resistance,</b> could be directly related to the constituent phases and the lattice parameters of the remaining tetragonal zirconia. At low M 2 O 3 dopant contents ≤ 0. 4 mol%, the different aging behavior of tetragonal zirconia was attributed to the defect structure of the zirconia grain boundary which was influenced by the dopant cation radius. It was observed that the grain boundary ionic resistivity and the <b>aging</b> <b>resistance</b> followed the same trend: La 3 + > Nd 3 + > Al 3 + > Sc 3 +, proving that hydrothermal aging is driven by the diffusion of water-derived mobile species through the oxygen vacancies.
