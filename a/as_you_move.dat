These items include incense (which attract Pokémon to you <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>move</b> for thirty minutes), lure modules, to attract Pokémon to a fixed location, and lucky eggs, which double experience points gained for a thirty-minute period from use. All Pokémon are displayed with a combat power. A Pokémon's combat power is a rough measure of how powerful that Pokémon is in battle. Generally, as players level up, they catch Pokémon with higher CP.|$|E

They then outstretch their right arm inline with their right shoulder, hand flat in a vertical position. The dancer then rotates around the waist in a 180 degree sweep, pulling back three times <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>move</b> your arm to the left, and then in one motion swing right arm back to the right. The move is then repeated. The dancer may then swap arms and reverse the move.|$|E
25|$|The soils {{closest to}} the plains of the Saône are too fertile, with patches of poorly drained soils, that make growing quality wine grapes difficult. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>move</b> upwards along the cote {{escarpment}} the soil becomes progressively less fertile with higher proportions of the well-draining and highly porous oolitic limestone and less clay. At this elevation of around 800ft (250 m) most of the premier cru vineyards start to be found with areas of particularly favored location being designated as grand cru. The band of suitable soils for viticulture is narrow because too far up the hills (beyond 1000ft/300 m) the top soil becomes too thin to support vines.|$|E

500|$|The ride {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{upon its}} July 2014 opening. Lance Hart from Screamscape {{was impressed with}} the fact that the King's Cross entrance was hidden from the rest of the Diagon Alley area. He also credited Universal for making the train look as realistic as possible: [...] "Clearly they went to great lengths to create these cars to be replicas of what you see in the films, both on the outside as well as on the inside <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>move</b> down the hallway towards your cabin to take your seat". In terms of the overall experience Hart said, [...] "Universal has managed to turn what would simply be a method of transporting guests between their two parks into yet another must-see attraction ... tying together the overall story and theme of visiting Hogwarts at Islands of Adventure and Diagon Alley inside Universal Studios Florida".|$|E
500|$|The SIS {{building}} was positively critiqued by Deyan Sudjic in The Guardian in 1992 who {{described it as}} an [...] "epitaph for the [...] architecture of the eighties". Sudjic wrote that [...] "It's a design which combines high seriousness in its classical composition with a possible unwitting sense of humour. The building could be interpreted equally plausibly as a Mayan temple {{or a piece of}} clanking art deco machinery", and added that the most impressive thing about Farrell's design was the way he had not [...] "confined himself to a single idea" [...] as the building [...] "grows and develops <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>move</b> around it". In their 2014 Guide to London's Contemporary Architecture, Kenneth Allinson and Victoria Thornton wrote that [...] "Some see this building as Farrell's most controlled and mature building – a rich diet, certainly, but not a cacophony of rhetorical features, nor without the unselfconscious virtuosity which can uplift and excite. But it is undoubtedly too Gotham City for the taste of many. Farrell's many critics and opponents...would call it a nightmare: a secret service fortress, provided by a private speculator, designed by an avowed populist, and sited on a most prominent river location. Indubitably, it is a bizarre phenomenon".|$|E
500|$|Rendering lead Jessica McMackin {{spoke about}} the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: [...] "In {{addition}} to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and {{you want to get a}} feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be if you had a piece of red paper and held it up to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall." [...] Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground–locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: [...] "The ground-locking system is one of the things I’m most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen. On Cars, this system is built into the models themselves, and <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>move</b> the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but we had no idea how to do it." ...|$|E

5000|$|Gollop {{later said}} it was [...] "quite an ambitious project" [...] of turn-based {{tactical}} strategy game, featuring such innovative elements as a destructible terrain system. He said that had it been released, The Dreamland Chronicles would be very similar in gameplay terms to the much later tactical role-playing game Valkyria Chronicles, released for the PlayStation 3 in 2008: [...] "We had a third-person camera view behind your character with a bar representing your Action Points, which went down <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>moved.</b> When <b>you</b> went into shooting mode it went into a first-person view and you could select snap shots or aimed shots, which altered {{the size of an}} aiming circle on screen." ...|$|R

500|$|Production {{designer}} Carey Meyer {{built the}} ship Serenity {{in two parts}} (one for each level) as a complete set with ceilings and practical lighting installed {{as part of the}} set that the cameras could use along with moveable parts. The two-part set also allowed the second unit to shoot in one section while the actors and first unit worked undisturbed in the other. As Whedon recalled: [...] "...you could pull it away or move something huge, so that you could get in and around everything. That meant the environment worked for us and there weren't a lot of adjustments that needed to be made." [...] There were other benefits to this set design. One was that it allowed the viewers to feel they were really in a ship. For Whedon, the design of the ship was crucial in defining the known space for the viewer, and that there were not [...] "fourteen hundred decks and a holodeck and an all-you-can-eat buffet in the back". He wanted to convey that it was utilitarian and that it was [...] "beat-up but lived-in and ultimately, it was home". As Joss Whedon discusses in the DVD commentary, each room represented a feeling or character, usually conveyed by the paint color. He explains that <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>move</b> {{from the back of the}} ship in the engine room, toward the front of the ship to the bridge, the colors and mood progress from extremely warm to cooler. Besides evoking a mood associated with the character who spends most time in each area, the color scheme also alludes to the heat generated in the tail of the ship.|$|E

2500|$|Current {{research}} on the WSC focuses in on two areas: heat content and methane gas release. It {{has been well documented}} that the Atlantic Water core temperature associated with the WSC has increased by almost 1 °C in recent years. It has also been well documented that the Atlantic Water core temperature decreases <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>move</b> cyclonically around the Arctic. Thus, this means that heat is being lost to the surrounding water. As the temperature of the water is increased, more heat will be lost to the surrounding water as the WSC tracts around the Arctic Ocean. If the heat flux out of the Atlantic Water core in the WSC is vertically upward then that would lead to warming of the Arctic Surface Water and the melting of more Arctic Sea Ice. Thus, this current topic is of high interest because an increase of heat flux out of the AW core will result in more Arctic Sea Ice melting.|$|E

2500|$|However, Peniston herself {{seemed to}} be not worried about losing her audience, when interviewed {{at the time of}} I'm Movin' On release by Billboard: [...] "When you're first coming out as an artist, many times label {{executives}} have their own vision for you. But <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>move</b> forward, it's only fair that you begin determining your own direction. People will make the change with you as long as you’re honest about your craft and display a comfort for what it is that you’re doing," [...] two years later Peniston actually confirmed her doubts, after being questioned by the magazine: [...] "I can speak about this firsthand, believe me. Sometimes doing what you feel isn’t always accepted by the public. You’ve got to choose {{where you want to go}} and be consistent," [...] (said by the artist at the 5th annual Billboard Dance Music Summit that urged members of the dance music community to work together toward greater credibility, visibility and sales for the genre, held July 8–10 in 1998).|$|E
2500|$|The {{city can}} be divided into three sections: the Oregon Section (located in {{southern}} Pittston), the Downtown (or City Center), and the Junction (or Upper Pittston). The Oregon Section is a neighborhood located on high ground which overlooks the Susquehanna River (in the southern half of the city). The Downtown is located to the north (in the central part of Pittston). U.S. Route 11 runs through this part of the city. Two bridges cross over the Susquehanna and connect the Downtown with the Borough of West Pittston (on the opposite bank). The Downtown is where most of the city’s businesses and high-rises exist. The elevation climbs <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>move</b> inland (eastward) away from the Susquehanna. The northernmost section of the city is known as the Junction. It is named after the railroad junction (or the Duryea Yard) which runs through its borders.

50|$|Another {{advantage}} of the surface mounting of all components is that no additional holes or routs are needed to the guitar to fit the unit.

40|$|It {{started with}} an idea to create an empty space in which you {{activated}} music and light <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>moved</b> around. In responding to the music and lighting you would activate more or different sounds and thereby communicate with the space through your body. This led to an artistic research project in which children’s spontaneous movement was observed, a choreography made based on the children’s movements and music written and recorded for the choreography. This music was then decomposed and choreographed into an empty space at Botkyrka konsthall creating an interactive dance installation. It was realized using an interactive sound and light system in which 5 video cameras were detecting the motion in the room connected to a 4 -channel sound system {{and a set of}} 14 light modules. During five weeks people of all ages came to dance and move around in the installation. The installation attracted a wide range of people of all ages and the tentative evaluation indicates that it was very positively received and that it encouraged free movement in the intended way. Besides observing the activity in the installation interviews were made with schoolchildren age 7 who had participated in the installation...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examined the}} impact of species, physiological age and spacing on tree form and branching at a Nelder experiment located near Rolleston, Canterbury. Two species were compared, Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus nitens, at a range of stockings from 271 stems/ha to 40, 466 stems/ha. Within the P. radiata, two different physiological ages were compared. Stocking and species significantly affected (p-value < 0. 05) tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH), crown depth, branch mortality, branch angle, branch size and internode length. Only stocking was statistically significant for crown width, and height from the ground was also statistically significant for branch angle and branch mortality. DBH, crown width, crown depth, branch size and branch survival decreased with increasing stocking for both species. Branch angle and average internode length increased as stocking increased for both species, and branch angle and average internode length also increased <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>moved</b> away {{from the base of}} the tree. DBH, average internode length and branch size were significantly larger for P. radiata across all stockings, however branch mortality and branch angle were significantly larger for E. nitens. Physiological age was not statistically significant for any aspects of tree form or branching examined in this study...|$|R

60|$|The street {{cars are}} manned with conductors, and, therefore, are free {{from many of}} the perils of the omnibus; but they have perils of their own. They are always quite full. By that I mean that every seat is crowded, that there is a double row of men and women {{standing}} down the center, and that the driver's platform in front is full, and also the conductor's platform behind. That is the normal condition of a street car in the Third Avenue. You, as a stranger {{in the middle of the}} car, wish to be put down at, let us say, 89th Street. In the map of New York now before me, the cross streets running from east to west are numbered up northward as far as 154th Street. It is quite useless for you to give the number as you enter.
