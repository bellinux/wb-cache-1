5|$|The Virgin Tour was {{the debut}} concert tour by American singer-songwriter Madonna. The tour {{supported}} her first two studio albums, Madonna (1983) <b>and</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Virgin (1984). Although initially planned {{for an international}} audience, the tour was restricted to the United States and Canada. Warner decided to send Madonna on tour after Like a Virgin became a success. After an official announcement on March 15, 1985, Madonna and her team began production plans. She wanted the tour to be a reflection of her own self and collaborated with designer Maripol for the costumes.|$|E

25|$|The {{inspiration}} for the name came from a Pee-wee brand miniature harmonica and the surname of an energetic boy Reubens knew from his youth. Reubens thought the name Pee-wee Herman was a name that sounded too real to be made up, <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> real name a parent would give a child that they didn't really care about.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Stradlin {{recorded}} his sixth album, Like a Dog, with guitarist Rick Richards, drummer Taz Bentley, and bassist JT Longoria. It was originally {{scheduled for a}} late 2003 release, with just under one thousand promo copies made. However, the album was not released until October 2005, when Stradlin—prompted by a fan petition—made it available through internet order. The following year, Stradlin re-released Ride On, River, On Down the Road, <b>and</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Dog through iTunes.|$|E

25|$|As I {{walked down}} {{at this place}} I was walled on both sides by those {{inaccessible}} high rocky barren hills which hang over one’s head in some places and appear very terrible; and from them springs many little currents {{of water from the}} sides and clefts which trickle down to some lower part where it runs swiftly over the stones and shelves in the way, which makes a pleasant rush and murmuring noise <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> snowball is increased by each spring trickling down on either side of those hills, and so descends into the bottoms which are a Moorish ground in which in many places the waters stand, and so form some of those Lakes as it did here.|$|E
25|$|Even if {{the source}} {{intensity}} is turned down, {{so that only}} one particle (e.g. photon or electron) is passing through the apparatus at a time, the same interference pattern develops over time. The quantum particle acts as a wave when passing through the double slits, but as a particle when it is detected. This is a typical feature of quantum complementarity: a quantum particle will act as a wave in an experiment to measure its wave-like properties, <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> particle in an experiment to measure its particle-like properties. The point on the detector screen where any individual particle shows up will {{be the result of}} a random process. However, the distribution pattern of many individual particles will mimic the diffraction pattern produced by waves.|$|E
25|$|Maharaja Kameshwar Singh Bahadur (ruled 1929 to the {{independence}} of India in 1947) (born 28 November 1907, died 8 November 1964). He was member of the Council of State 1933–1946, member of the Constituent Assembly 1947–1952, and the Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha-Upper House) 1952–1958 and 1960–1962. He {{was the first person}} in India to get a bust of Mahatma Gandhi made, by celebrated artist Clare Sheridan, cousin of Winston Churchill. The bust was presented to the viceroy of India, Victor Hope, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow, to be displayed in Government House (now Rashtrapati Bhawan). This was acknowledged by Gandhi in a letter to Lord Linlithgow in 1940. Gandhi, in an interview during his visit to Bihar in 1947, said that the Maharaja Kameshwar Singh was an extremely good person <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> son to him.|$|E

25|$|Troubled by this paradox, Gerard 't Hooft {{analyzed}} the emission of Hawking radiation in more detail. He noted that when Hawking radiation escapes, {{there is a}} way in which incoming particles can modify the outgoing particles. Their gravitational field would deform the horizon of the black hole, and the deformed horizon could produce different outgoing particles than the undeformed horizon. When a particle falls into a black hole, it is boosted relative to an outside observer, and its gravitational field assumes a universal form. 't Hooft showed that this field makes a logarithmic tent-pole shaped bump on the horizon of a black hole, <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> shadow, the bump is an alternative description of the particle's location and mass. For a four-dimensional spherical uncharged black hole, the deformation of the horizon is similar to the type of deformation which describes the emission and absorption of particles on a string-theory world sheet. Since the deformations on the surface are the only imprint of the incoming particle, and since these deformations would have to completely determine the outgoing particles, 't Hooft believed that the correct description of the black hole would be by some form of string theory.|$|E

500|$|The dual {{nature of}} the Eye goddess shows, as Graves-Brown puts it, that [...] "the Egyptians saw a double nature to the feminine, which {{encompassed}} both extreme passions of fury and love." [...] This same view of femininity is found in texts describing human women, such as the Instruction of Ankhsheshonq, which says a man's wife is like a cat when he can keep her happy <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lioness when he cannot.|$|E
500|$|The {{stage was}} {{triangular}} and included ramps around it, with lighting arrangements hanging about 30 feet above. Four giant screens lined three {{sides of the}} stage's outer perimeter.
