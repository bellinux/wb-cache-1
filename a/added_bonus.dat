5|$|Claymore {{took place}} on 4 March 1941. The Germans were caught {{unprepared}} and the landings were unopposed. Within an hour No. 4 Commando had taken all its objectives. The raid was a success: 11 fish oil factories and storage tanks were destroyed, 10 ships sunk, 225 prisoners taken with {{an unknown number of}} German sailors killed on the sunken ships. An <b>added</b> <b>bonus</b> were the 315 Norwegian volunteers brought back to join the Free Norwegian Forces.|$|E
5|$|Similarly {{to other}} {{distributed}} computing projects, Folding@home quantitatively assesses user computing {{contributions to the}} project through a credit system. All units from a given protein project have uniform base credit, which is determined by benchmarking one or more work units from that project on an official reference machine before the project is released. Each user receives these base points for completing every work unit, though {{through the use of}} a passkey they can receive <b>added</b> <b>bonus</b> points for reliably and rapidly completing units which are more demanding computationally or have a greater scientific priority. Users may also receive credit for their work by clients on multiple machines. This point system attempts to align awarded credit with the value of the scientific results.|$|E

25|$|Biba smocks were {{uncomfortable and}} itchy, and stopped women’s arms from bending - {{something}} that did not stop customers from buying the clothes. They became the uniform of the era, with the <b>added</b> <b>bonus</b> of that whatever you bought, you could always get accessories to match.|$|E
25|$|In November 1958, Meccano Ltd {{introduced}} the Dublo Dinky range of models in 1:76 OO scale, {{designed to be}} used with the Hornby railway system (Force 1988, pp.165–166). These were relatively cheap to produce – having a one-piece die-cast metal body, a base plate and or windows on some, and plastic wheels. There was the <b>added</b> <b>bonus</b> of being able to compete in the small-scale toy car market which, at the time was dominated by Lesney's Matchbox (see Force 1988, p.47).|$|E

25|$|The Great Central Railway has a {{reasonable}} running length with the <b>added</b> <b>bonus</b> of a mainline setup, and {{so some of}} Britain's largest locomotives have been there in recent years. The steam fleet currently comprises over a dozen mainline classes, many of them either heavy freight, express passenger or shunting tank engines. Some are of types that were preserved in abundance elsewhere, but others have been leased from the National Collection. On most days a green-liveried, two-car British Rail Class 101 DMU runs from Loughborough to Leicester.|$|E
25|$|The League Cup {{then took}} centre stage as Tottenham took on Doncaster Rovers {{in the second}} round. Spurs eased {{their way to a}} 5–1 victory over their lower league counterparts, with Spurs having the <b>added</b> <b>bonus</b> of five {{different}} goal scorers; strikes from Tom Huddlestone, Jamie O'Hara, Peter Crouch, David Bentley and Roman Pavlyuchenko sealed the win and passage to the next round. In the ensuing draw, it was announced that Tottenham would face Preston North End in the third round of the cup.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, Alan Sainsbury became {{chairman}} {{after the}} death of his father, John Benjamin Sainsbury. During the 1950s and 1960s, Sainsbury's was a keen early adopter of self-service supermarkets in the United Kingdom; the first self-service store within the country was a co-operative store opened in 1942. On a trip to the United States of America, Alan Sainsbury realised the benefits of self-service stores and believed the future of Sainsbury's was self-service supermarkets of , with eventually the <b>added</b> <b>bonus</b> of a car park for extra convenience. The first self-service branch opened in Croydon in 1950.|$|E

25|$|As the {{inhabitants}} of Redwall Abbey bask in the glorious Summer of the Late Rose, all is quiet and peaceful. But things are not as they seem. Cluny the Scourge—the evil one-eyed rat warlord, is hell-bent on destroying the tranquility {{as he prepares to}} fight a bloody battle for the ownership of Redwall. This dazzling story in the Redwall series is packed with all the wit, wisdom, humor, and blood-curdling adventure of the other books in the collection, but has the <b>added</b> <b>bonus</b> of taking the reader right back to {{the heart and soul of}} Redwall Abbey and the characters who live there.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, every bivector can {{be written}} as the sum of two simple bivectors. It is useful to choose two {{orthogonal}} bivectors for this, and this is always possible to do. Moreover, for a generic bivector the choice of simple bivectors is unique, that is, {{there is only one}} way to decompose into orthogonal bivectors; the only exception is when the two orthogonal bivectors have equal magnitudes (as in the above example): in this case the decomposition is not unique. The decomposition is always unique in the case of simple bivectors, with the <b>added</b> <b>bonus</b> that one of the orthogonal parts is zero.|$|E
25|$|One {{fraction}} supported {{building the}} main station near Eidsberg Church. This had the <b>added</b> <b>bonus</b> of {{being close to}} the ferry quay at Grønsund and was a central transport hub in the community. These proposals called for a line traversing the municipality from Moss via Eidsberg to Ørje. Once such a route was discarded in 1873, the debate cooked down to a route to the east or to the west, close to the river Glomma. The eastern alternative was ultimately victorious. The station and line opened on 24 November 1882, although temporary traffic had taken place since July.|$|E

25|$|Alexios {{appealed to}} Philip {{to help him}} and his father regain the Byzantine throne. Fortunately for Alexios IV, Phillip had good {{connections}} with the new leader of the Fourth Crusade, Boniface I of Montferrat (Theobald III, Count of Champagne had died in 1201). Therefore, when Alexios offered 500 Knights, 10,000 soldiers along with food and money to help the Crusaders with their drive to Egypt, Doge Dandolo and the other leaders of the Fourth Crusade happily accepted this new challenge. Both {{the money and the}} troops were desperately needed by the Crusaders as they had neither in the quantities they required- especially to pay of the Venetian debt of 34,000 silver marks. As an <b>added</b> <b>bonus,</b> Alexios IV promised to submit the Byzantine Church to the Church of Rome.|$|E
25|$|Heraclius later {{moved on}} to the Great Palace of Dastagird only to {{discover}} that Khosrau II had fled his Palace. In a fit of rage, Heraclius ordered that everything be burnt to the ground. Moving on, he soon found that Khosrau no longer commanded the loyalty of his subjects— as they refused to rally to defend Ctesiphon. Heraclius waited a week or two before marching his army back. Khosrau's son Siroes took power as Kavadh II and had his father shot to death with arrows. Later, the formation of a peace treaty favourable to the Byzantines led to the restoration of the pre-war boundaries. As an <b>added</b> <b>bonus,</b> all captives and Christian relics that had been captured by the Persians were returned. Thus, it was {{at the head of the}} True Cross that Heraclius entered the Capital on September 14, 628 triumphant. Leading a procession which included four elephants, the True Cross was placed high atop the altar of the Hagia Sophia.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} the Ottomans {{considerably}} changed the mood within Constantinople. The rewards reaped by the Empire were outstanding considering that {{only a short time}} had passed since the city (and possibly the Empire itself) stood on the brink of destruction. John VII appeared to have achieved numerous other benefits for Byzantium. The first was a non-aggression treaty between the local Christian powers (who were also free from Ottoman servitude), meaning that the disasters of Andronikos III's later rule would not be repeated. Next were a treaty between Byzantium and the successor of Bayezid, Süleyman who was in Asia Minor, confirming Byzantium's freedom from paying tribute. The Empire also gained Mount Athos and coastal land of the Black Sea from Constantinople to Varna. As an <b>added</b> <b>bonus,</b> Imperial authority was asserted over a number of Aegean Islands. The importance of the latter should not be underestimated as these would serve in the future as refuge for any seeking to escape Ottoman expansion, even if only as a temporary refuge.|$|E

500|$|The first U.S. {{issue of}} the album was on the Dunhill Records {{division}} of ABC Records. It featured a revised cover with a white background instead of purple. The mid-priced [...] "Charisma Classics" [...] re-issue from the early 1980s had a blue cover. [...] A re-mastered version of this album <b>added</b> <b>bonus</b> tracks and was released in 2005. One of the additions is a studio version of [...] "Squid / Octopus", a song {{that had been a}} staple of early Van der Graaf Generator concerts.|$|E
500|$|By the mid-eighties, post-disco {{dance music}} was {{extremely}} popular {{and the concept}} of remix was widely regarded as a new direction of music. Several artists were remixing their tracks and compiling them to create new albums. Hence Madonna, who was the most popular dance artist of that era, decided to create a similar remix compilation album, later titled You Can Dance, which included seven of her up-tempo songs. Along with the pre-released tracks in remixed form, [...] "Spotlight" [...] was included as an <b>added</b> <b>bonus.</b> Madonna said that she was inspired by the song [...] "Everybody Is a Star" [...] (1970), by American rock band Sly and the Family Stone.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{and artificial}} intelligence {{were the most}} praised aspects of the game. Game Revolution noted the gameplay was [...] "well above average" [...] and had an excellent replay value, in contrast to games such as Star Fox 64 once completed. Perry praised the game's wide variety of weapons and gadgets, having counted at least thirty different weapons and equipment for the player to use, with the <b>added</b> <b>bonus</b> of secret weapons, adding to the gameplay value. Game Revolution added that the AI was [...] "perhaps {{the best part of}} the game", commending on how certain enemies react on when one of their comrades are killed nearby. IGN similarly praised its AI, pointing out on how every time a level is played the AI would change its behaviour, sometimes hiding behind trees or carrying different weapons.|$|E
50|$|Cultural: Cultural {{buildings}} provide happiness, {{which increases}} the productivity and <b>adds</b> <b>bonuses</b> to coin and supply productions when the population is happy or enthusiastic. On the other hand, a lack of happiness can cause {{a decrease in the}} production of such items. Cultural buildings are similar to decorations; however, they need to be connected to a road.|$|R
