5|$|The Commission's final report, {{released}} in May 1940, reflected many of Macdonald's recommendations. Mackenzie King called a federal-provincial conference in January 1941 {{to discuss the}} report. The provinces failed to agree on what should be done, but in April, the federal government went <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> its own announcing it would levy steep taxes on personal and corporate incomes as a temporary measure to finance Canada's participation in the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|After Prop 17 lost by a voter {{margin of}} 53–47, the project's opponents – which {{had grown to}} include other {{environmental}} groups, such as the Friends of the River and the Sierra Club – shifted their focus on limiting {{the amount of water}} the reservoir could hold, rather than trying to stop the dam altogether. In the meantime, construction on the dam continued to progress. On April 1, 1978 the gates of the diversion tunnel were closed, and New Melones Lake began to fill, soon inundating the old Melones Dam. As the reservoir filled, work moved <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> the power plant and generating units, which were all completed by the end of 1978. The main embankment of the dam was topped out on October 28, 1978.|$|E

5|$|Athletic's quarter-final {{began on}} 21 January with a goalless draw at the La Rosaleda Stadium against Málaga, but eight {{days later in}} the second leg Aduriz scored three minutes into the second half to send them into the semi-finals. The semi-final against Espanyol began with a 11 home draw, Aduriz putting Bilbao <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> his 34th {{birthday}} and Víctor Sánchez equalising ten minutes before half time. On 4 March, Athletic travelled for the second leg at the Estadi Cornellà-El Prat and won 20 to reach the final, with first-half goals from Aduriz and Etxeita.|$|E
5|$|Despite its problems, the {{locomotive}} displayed outstanding steaming characteristics and total traction {{from the two}} power bogies on its trial runs. When properly fired, the Leader was capable of {{keeping up with the}} schedules, even running <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> occasions. However, operational difficulties when stopping for water tended to lose any time advantages gained and affected the published performance figures. Despite hauling test trains over the Central Section of the former Southern Railway, the Leader prototype was never used on a revenue-earning service because of the risk of failure of the valve gear and the adverse publicity this would cause for British Railways.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{retirement}} of long-standing WIBF belt holder Regina Halmich, Kentikian unified the WBA and vacant WIBF Flyweight titles {{in her hometown of}} Hamburg on December 7, 2007. She met Nadia Hokmi in a rematch of their contest six months earlier. The French boxer again proved to be a tough opponent and the fight developed very similarly to their first encounter. Once more, Kentikian had the better start, but Hokmi scored {{during the second half of}} the fight, again making it a close bout. This time however, Kentikian was <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> all three of the judges' scorecards, winning by unanimous decision.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, an {{overwhelming}} majority of voters in the TID and MID service areas and San Francisco approved bond issues to finance {{the construction of a new}} dam. The irrigation districts hoped to complete the dam by 1966, but concerns that the dam would further impact decreasing populations of king salmon in the Tuolumne put a temporary stop to the project. In fact, it was not until that year that the Federal Power Commission (now Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) licensed the irrigation districts to go <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> New Don Pedro.|$|E

He was {{assigned}} the Chief Public Defender of Santa Cruz County, attorney Jim Jackson—who had defended John Linley Frazier and also been assigned to the Herbert Mullin case—but due to Kemper's explicit and detailed confession, his counsel's only option was to plead {{not guilty by reason}} of insanity to the charges. Kemper twice tried to commit suicide in custody, surviving both times. His trial went <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> October 23, 1973.|$|E
5|$|Now {{facing a}} more rugged and {{hazardous}} trek, Young chose {{to follow the}} trail used by the Donner–Reed party on their journey to California the previous year. As the vanguard company traveled through the rugged mountains, they divided into three sections.

The small sick detachment lagged behind the larger group, and a scouting division was created to move farther <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> the designated route.|$|E

5|$|By {{the evening}} of 4 June, the Allied {{meteorological}} team, headed by Group Captain James Stagg of the Royal Air Force, predicted that the weather would improve sufficiently so that the invasion could go <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> 6 June. He met Eisenhower and other senior commanders at their headquarters at Southwick House in Hampshire to discuss the situation. General Montgomery and Major General Walter Bedell Smith, Eisenhower's chief of staff, were eager to launch the invasion. Admiral Bertram Ramsay was prepared to commit his ships, while Air Chief Marshal Trafford Leigh-Mallory {{expressed concern that the}} conditions would be unfavourable for Allied aircraft. After much discussion, Eisenhower decided that the invasion should go ahead. Allied control of the Atlantic meant that German meteorologists did not have access to as much information as the Allies on incoming weather patterns. As the Luftwaffe meteorological centre in Paris predicted two weeks of stormy weather, many Wehrmacht commanders left their posts to attend war games in Rennes, and men in many units were given leave. Marshal Erwin Rommel returned to Germany for his wife's birthday and to meet Hitler to try to get more Panzers.|$|E
5|$|Group Captain James Stagg of the Royal Air Force (RAF) met Eisenhower on {{the evening}} of 4 June. He and his {{meteorological}} team predicted that the weather would improve enough for the invasion to proceed on 6 June. The next available dates with the required tidal conditions (but without the desirable full moon) would be two weeks later, from 18 to 20 June. Postponement of the invasion would have required recalling men and ships already in position to cross the Channel, and would have increased the chance that the invasion plans would be detected. After much discussion with the other senior commanders, Eisenhower decided that the invasion should go <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> the 6th. A major storm battered the Normandy coast from 19 to 22 June, which would have made the beach landings impossible.|$|E
5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply torques between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight <b>ahead.</b> <b>On</b> bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E

5|$|Max bumps into Niall Rafferty (Barry Sloane) in {{the village}} and tells him that his wedding with Steph is back on. Niall is devastated but tries to remain {{composed}} in front of Max. Steph has big plans for her wedding day and it looks as if it’s getting out of control as Jack worries about how much it's going to cost, with Jack even suggesting to Frankie and Steph that he should call Johnno and ask him to contribute to the cost of the wedding, a suggestion that Steph and Frankie refute immediately on the basis that Johnno was never very good with money, and also that he was now married to Michelle and was therefore preoccupied with bringing up his new son Presley. With only 48 hours until their big day everything starts to go wrong and when Steph accidentally rips her wedding dress it's the final straw. A devastated Steph announces there's no way the wedding can go <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> Thursday.|$|E
5|$|Series one of {{the show}} aired in September of that year, {{consisting}} of five two-part half-hour stories. Individual half-hour episodes aired once a week on BBC One, with episodes airing a week <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> children's digital channel CBBC. The final part aired in November 2007. The second series started in September 2008 using the same format, with six stories instead of five, ending the series in December. The third series started 15 October 2009, twice weekly (Thursdays and Fridays) on BBC One from 15 October to 20 November. The fourth series aired from 11 October 2010. The first of each story pair was accompanied by an episode of Sarah Jane's Alien Files, a set of 25-minute episodes in which {{a member of the}} cast updates Mr. Smith's database about certain aliens. It accompanied series 4 of the programme.|$|E
5|$|The RPF {{selected}} Paul Kagame as its presidential candidate, {{to run for}} {{his first}} full term following his three-year transitional presidency. His main challenger was Faustin Twagiramungu, who had been prime minister from 1994 to 1995, when he resigned and moved to Brussels after a disagreement with Kagame. Twagiramungu had intended to run as the candidate for the MDR, but instead sought the presidency as an independent following the party's banishment. Twagiramungu returned to the country in June 2003 and began campaigning in August. Two other candidates also ran: Alvera Mukabaramba, a medical doctor and former MDR member running for the newly formed Party for Progress and Concord (PPC), and Jean Nepomuscene Nayinzira, an independent and former member of parliament who cited belief in God as {{a central part of}} his campaign. Mukabaramba pulled out one day before the election, accusing Twagiramungu of ethnic propaganda and advising her supporters to vote for Kagame. The election went <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> 25 August with Kagame, Twagiramungu and Nayinzira as candidates.|$|E

5|$|The World Cup final {{match is}} the last of the competition, and the result determines which country is {{declared}} world champions. If after 90 minutes of regular play the score is a draw, an additional 30-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If such a game is still tied after extra time it is decided by kicks from the penalty shoot-out. The team winning the penalty shoot-out are then declared champions. The tournament has been decided by a one-off match on every occasion except 1950, when the tournament winner was decided by a final round-robin group contested by four teams (Uruguay, Brazil, Sweden, and Spain). Uruguay's 2–1 victory over Brazil was the decisive match (and one of the last two matches of the tournament) which put them <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> points and ensured that they finished top of the group as world champions. Therefore, this match is regarded by FIFA as the de facto final of the 1950 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|The {{season began}} with a 2–1 win over Mansfield Town at Field Mill on 19 August; Chris Marron put Mansfield <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> 52 minutes, before Roy Sproson scored the {{equaliser}} on 69 minutes, Basil Hayward scored the winning goal three minutes later after being the first {{to react to the}} rebound that came when Colin Askey's shot hit the crossbar. The main surprise in the line-up of the opening day was that goalkeeper Ray Hancock had been dropped in favour of Ray King after King impressed in the pre-season friendly, the club's positive season meant that Hancock was unable to win back his place in the side. Vale were then held to two consecutive goalless draws but remained unbeaten in their first seven league games, conceding just two goals. This run included a 3–0 win over Darlington at Feethams, and a 4–0 win over Barrow in which Hayward scored a hat-trick. They had risen {{to the top of the}} table by the third game of the season and remained in first place until the end of the season. Of the Barrow first eleven that day three of the players were brothers: Jack, Alan and Bert Keen.|$|E

After delay, the proposal to close seven state parks and a dozen state historic sites, including Apple River Fort, went <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> November 30, 2008.
