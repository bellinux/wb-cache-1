Now try to play detached tones for twenty seconds and do you do it? Well I found {{that something was wrong}} because I couldn't play half, not even a fourth <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hold a tone. When you play you must let only the amount of air pass the lips that is needed to produce the tone—no more. I went to work on this and now I can play an air or an allegro exercise as long as I can hold a tone." ...|$|E

2500|$|After all of Watchman Nee’s close {{co-workers}} {{were arrested}} on January 29, 1956, Tang and Ren were elected as elders, {{not by the}} congregation {{of the church in}} Shanghai, but by the [...] "Believers’ Political Re-education Committee," [...] which had been formed to oversee the political indoctrination of the church’s members. Tang and Ren cooperated in the PRC’s campaign to denounce Watchman Nee as a counterrevolutionary. Tang had earlier {{been a member of the}} Three-Self Standing Committee but withdrew from this position due to criticism by church members that he had betrayed the church in Shanghai. After his cooperation in denouncing Watchman Nee, Tang was reinstated and made a TSPM Vice Chairman. Under the leadership of Tang and Ren the Nanyang Road meeting hall built under Watchman Nee’s oversight for the church in Shanghai was given to the TSPM in 1958 and any semblance of the church in Shanghai’s meetings ceased. After undergoing re-education in a reform-through-labor (laogai) camp during the Cultural Revolution, Tang was reinstated as a Vice Chairman in the newly re-established TSPM and made a member of the standing committee of the China Christian Council, which was established by the TSPM in 1980. In July 1981 Tang issued a statement titled [...] "Pouring Out My Heart to the Party," [...] in which he said, [...] "I made a decision: anything that was expedient to the Party and our country, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do it, I would do it and would do it well." ...|$|E
