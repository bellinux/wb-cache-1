40|$|MSW {{sanitary}} landfills represent nowadays one of {{the most}} important issue related to the waste management cycle. In particular, knowledge about biogas production is a key aspect for a proper exploitation of this energy source, even in the <b>after-care</b> <b>phase.</b> In the present study, a simple mathematical model was proposed for the simulation of biogas production. The model is based on 1 st order biodegradation kinetic and takes also into account the temperature variation in time and depth and the landfill settlement. The model was applied to a real landfill located in Sicily (ITALY) and its simulation result was compared with experimental data (volumes of biogas collected by the recovery system and diffuse emissions directly measured by authors). The obtained result showed a good fitting between simulation results and methane production evaluated with experimental data, suggesting that the model can be the proposed model can be applied for reliable estimates of landfill gas production, thus representing a useful tool for landfill operators also for a reliable estimate of the <b>after-care</b> <b>phase</b> duration...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of parameters determining the potential emissions {{of two different}} mechanically-biologically pretreated municipal solid wastes (MBT wastes) is elucidated in this work. The origins of the wastes are Germany and Sweden. By means of lab-scale experiments, increased stabilisation through composting is preferably determined by a decrease in respiration activity. Concurrently, the stabilisation is verified for the leachates by a decrease in COD, DOC, and BOD(5). Total organic carbon content reflects stabilisation less accurately. FT-IR and thermal analytical methods add valuable information {{about the state of}} degradation, especially when several distinct thermal parameters are taken into account. Mobility of Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn produced by a batch leaching test with deionized water is reduced by the pretreatment of both materials. Mobility of copper unambiguously increased. A principle component analysis (PCA) of membrane fractionated leachates indicates an affinity of Cu to mobile humic acids or dissolved organic carbon. High Cr, Zn, and Ni contents in the solid co-occur with high contents of solid humic acids. To a lesser extent, this is also true for solid Cd, Cu, and Pb contents. Due to differences in required landfilling conditions, actual emissions and <b>after-care</b> <b>phase</b> length will depend on whether each waste is landfilled in Germany or Sweden...|$|E
40|$|Water {{recycling}} to {{the landfill}} body today is tested or already applied {{on a large}} scale in order to control and to accelerate the biodegradation processes within the reactor “landfill“. Targeted water recycling to the landfill body aims at accelerated decomposition of all degradable material within short foreseeable periods. For this purpose various methods are applied, {{such as the use of}} existing gas wells as sink shafts or of pipe systems installed under the sealing and the installation of lances. The results first revealed that discharge of pollutants via the gas phase directly depends on the water quantity recycled. Examining the discharge of pollutants via the leachate, the situation was completely different. The results from the leachate emissions showed that a water quantity of 2 mm/d is not sufficient to effect optimal accelerated pollutant discharge from the landfill body. With this water quantity recycled on the landfill body no dosage response could be stated. Therefore it was assumed that only a water quantity recycled of 4 - 8 mm/d leads to optimum accelerated discharge of pollutants via the water phase of the landfill body. A model was developed to prognosticate the gas production and the leachate emissions under the influence of water recycling. These new approaches for the prognosis of gas and water emission served to develop models which in future will allow to assess the emissions of a reactor landfill to be expected under the influence of water recycling. Thus the <b>after-care</b> <b>phase</b> of a reactor landfill can be determined more exactly...|$|E
