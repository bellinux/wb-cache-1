The central flowers {{are said to be}} neuter or sterile, but I obtained by <b>artificial</b> <b>fertilisation</b> a seed (fruit) apparently perfect from one such flower. (Introduction/12. 'The English Flora' by Sir J.E. Smith 1824 volume 2 page 39.) Occasionally two or three of the flowers next to the central one are similarly characterised; and according to Vaucher [...] "cette singuliere degeneration s'etend quelquefois a l'ombelle entiere." [...] (Introduction/13. 'Hist. Phys. des Plantes d'Europe' 1841 tome 2 page 614. On the Echinophora page 627.) That the modified central flower is of no functional importance to the plant is almost certain. It may perhaps be a remnant of a former and ancient condition of the species, when one flower alone, the central one, was female and yielded seeds, as in the Umbelliferous genus Echinophora. There is nothing surprising in the central flower tending to retain its former condition longer than the others; for when irregular flowers become regular or peloric, they are apt to be central; and such peloric flowers apparently owe their origin either to arrested development--that is, to the preservation of an early stage of development--or to reversion. Central and perfectly developed flowers in not a few plants in their normal condition (for instance, the common Rue and Adoxa) differ slightly in structure, as in the number of the parts, from the other flowers on the same plant. All such cases seem connected with the fact of the bud which stands {{at the end of the}} shoot being better nourished than the others, as it receives the most sap. (Introduction/14.

I do not doubt that this is usually the case, and that the fertility often suddenly decreases {{in the first few}} generations. Nevertheless I believe that in all these experiments the fertility has been diminished by an independent cause, namely, from close interbreeding. I have collected so large a body of facts, showing that close interbreeding lessens fertility, and, on the other hand, that an occasional cross with a distinct individual or variety increases fertility, that I cannot doubt the correctness of this almost universal belief amongst breeders. Hybrids are seldom raised by experimentalists in great numbers; and as the parent-species, or other allied hybrids, generally grow in the same garden, the visits of insects must be carefully prevented during the flowering season: hence hybrids will generally be fertilised during each generation by their own individual pollen; and I am convinced that this would be injurious to their fertility, already lessened by their hybrid origin. I am strengthened in this conviction by a remarkable statement repeatedly made by Gartner, namely, that if even the less fertile hybrids be artificially fertilised with hybrid pollen of the same kind, their fertility, notwithstanding the frequent ill effects of manipulation, sometimes decidedly increases, and goes on increasing. Now, in <b>artificial</b> <b>fertilisation</b> pollen is as often taken by chance (as I know from my own experience) from the anthers of another flower, as from the anthers of the flower itself which is to be fertilised; so that a cross between two flowers, though probably on the same plant, would be thus effected. Moreover, whenever complicated experiments are in progress, so careful an observer as Gartner would have castrated his hybrids, and this would have insured in each generation a cross with the pollen from a distinct flower, either from the same plant or from another plant of the same hybrid nature. And thus, the strange fact of the increase of fertility in the successive generations of ARTIFICIALLY FERTILISED hybrids may, I believe, be accounted for by close interbreeding having been avoided.|$|E

With respect to this decrease, it may first be noticed that when any deviation in structure or constitution is common to both parents, this is often transmitted in an augmented degree to the offspring; and both sexual elements in hybrid plants are already affected in some degree. But I believe that their fertility has been diminished in nearly all these cases by an independent cause, namely, by too close interbreeding. I have made so many experiments and collected so many facts, showing {{on the one hand}} that an occasional cross with a distinct individual or variety increases the vigour and fertility of the offspring, {{and on the other hand}} that very close interbreeding lessens their vigour and fertility, that I cannot doubt the correctness of this conclusion. Hybrids are seldom raised by experimentalists in great numbers; and as the parent-species, or other allied hybrids, generally grow in the same garden, the visits of insects must be carefully prevented during the flowering season: hence hybrids, if left to themselves, will generally be fertilised during each generation by pollen from the same flower; and this would probably be injurious to their fertility, already lessened by their hybrid origin. I am strengthened in this conviction by a remarkable statement repeatedly made by Gartner, namely, that if even the less fertile hybrids be artificially fertilised with hybrid pollen of the same kind, their fertility, notwithstanding the frequent ill effects from manipulation, sometimes decidedly increases, and goes on increasing.

40|$|AbstractThe taxonomic {{composition}} {{and types of}} particles comprising the downward particle flux were examined during the mesoscale <b>artificial</b> iron <b>fertilisation</b> experiment LOHAFEX. The experiment was conducted in low-silicate waters of the Atlantic Sector of the Southern Ocean during austral summer (January–March 2009), and induced a bloom dominated by small flagellates. Downward particle flux was low throughout the experiment, and not enhanced by addition of iron; neutrally buoyant sediment traps contained mostly faecal pellets and faecal material apparently reprocessed by mesozooplankton. TEP fluxes were low, ≤ 5 mgGXeq. m− 2 d− 1, and a few phytodetrital aggregates {{were found in the}} sediment traps. Only a few per cent of the POC flux was found in the traps consisting of intact protist plankton, although remains of taxa with hard body parts (diatoms, tintinnids, thecate dinoflagellates and foraminifera) were numerous, far more so than intact specimens of these taxa. Nevertheless, many small flagellates and coccoid cells, belonging to the pico- and nanoplankton, were found in the traps, and these small, soft-bodied cells probably contributed the majority of downward POC flux via mesozooplankton grazing and faecal pellet export. TEP likely played an important role by aggregating these small cells, and making them more readily available to mesozooplankton grazers...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} iron (Fe) and Fe-light (Fe-L) co-limitation on cellular silica (BSi), carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in two marine diatom species, Thalassiosira oceanica and Ditylum brightwellii. We showed that C and N per cell tend to decrease with increasing Fe and Fe-L co-limitation (i. e. decreasing growth rate). We observed an increase (T. oceanica, Fe-L co-limitation), no change (T. oceanica, Fe limitation) and a decrease (D. brightwellii, Fe and Fe-L limitations) in BSi per cell with increasing degree of limitation. When comparing our results to literature data, we noted that the trend in C and N per cell for other Fe limited diatoms was similar to ours. However there was no global trend in BSi, which suggests interspecific differences. The relative variations in C:N, Si:C and Si:N versus the relative variation in specific growth rate (i. e. μ:μ max) followed the same patterns for both species under Fe and Fe-L co-limitation. The variations of C:N under Fe limitation {{reported in the literature}} for other diatoms are contrasted, which may thus be more related to growth conditions than to interspecific differences. Si:C and Si:N ratios increased by more than 2 -fold between 100 % and 40 % of μ max. Under more severe limitation (Fe or Fe-L), these ratios tend to decrease. To asses the field significance of our results, we compared them to those of <b>artificial</b> Fe <b>fertilisation</b> experiments. This comparison showed that Si:N increased between 100 % and ~ 40 % of μ max, but decreased between 40 % and 20 % of μ max, and increased again below 20 % of μ max. Between ~ 15 % and 30 % of μ max, Si:N was even lower than under non limiting conditions. These results may have important biogeochemical implications on the understanding and the modeling of the oceanic biogeochemical cycles, e. g. carbon export...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDiatoms {{are a major}} {{component}} of phytoplankton community. They tend to dominate under natural high-nutrient concentrations, as well as during <b>artificial</b> Fe <b>fertilisation</b> experiments. They are main players in the biogeochemical cycle of carbon (C), as they can account for 40 % of the total primary production in the Ocean and dominate export production, {{as well as in the}} biogeochemical cycles of the other macro-nutrients, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and silicon (Si). Another important nutrient is Fe, which was shown to have a direct or indirect effect on nearly all the biogeochemical parameters of diatoms. In the present paper, an inventory is made of the growth, physiology and fate of many diatom species, including maximum growth rate, photosynthetic parameters (maximum specific rate of photosynthesis, photosynthetic efficiency and light adaptation parameter), nutrient limitation (half-saturation constant for growth/uptake), cellular elemental ratios, and loss terms (sinking rates, autolysis rates and grazing rates). This is a first step for improvement of the parameterisation of physiologically based phytoplankton growth and global 3 D carbon models. This review is a synthesis of a large number of published laboratory experiments using monospecific cultures as well as field data. Our compilation confirms that size is an important factor explaining variations of biogeochemical parameters of diatoms (e. g. maximum growth rate, photosynthesis parameters, half-saturation constants, sinking rate, and grazing). Some variations of elemental ratios can be explained by adaptation of intracellular requirements or storage of Fe, and P, for instance. The important loss processes of diatoms pointed out by this synthesis are (i) sinking, as single cells as well as through aggregation which generally greatly increases sinking rate, (ii) cell autolysis, which can significantly reduce net growth rates, especially under nutrient limitation when gross growth rates are low, and (iii) grazing by both meso- and micro-zooplankton. This review also defines gaps concerning our knowledge on some important points. For example, we need to better know which iron species is available for phytoplankton, as well as the impact of Fe on the variation of the elemental ratios, especially in terms of assimilation and regeneration of C and N. A better quantification of prey selection by microzooplankton and mesozooplankton in natural environments is also needed, including preference for the various phytoplankton and zooplankton species as well as for aggregates and faecal pellets...|$|R

50|$|Hatcheries produce larval and {{juvenile}} {{fish and shellfish}} for transferral to aquaculture facilities where they are ‘on-grown’ to reach harvest size. Hatchery production confers three main benefits to the industry;1. Out of season productionConsistent supply of fish from aquaculture facilities is an important market requirement. Broodstock conditioning can extend the natural spawning season and thus the supply of juveniles to farms. Supply can be further guaranteed by sourcing from hatcheries in the opposite hemisphere i.e. with opposite seasons.2. Genetic improvementGenetic modification is conducted in some hatcheries {{to improve the quality}} and yield of farmed species. <b>Artificial</b> <b>fertilisation</b> facilitates selective breeding programs which aim to improve production characteristics such as growth rate, disease resistance, survival, colour, increased fecundity and/or lower age of maturation.

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognised}} that some oceanic regions have persistently low-chlorophyll levels, {{even though there are}} abundant inorganic nutrients. Studies have shown that these high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) areas are depleted in iron, an essential micronutrient. In these regions biological production can be enhanced with <b>artificial</b> mesoscale iron <b>fertilisation.</b> However, the ability of iron-induced blooms to efficiently sequester carbon to mesopelagic depths is still an open question. It is hypothesised that sub-Antarctic islands in the HNLC Southern Ocean are also a source of iron and thus fuel the natural phytoplankton blooms observed in their proximity, thereby enhancing levels of particulate organic carbon (POC) export. To test the third part of this hypothesis, POC export was measured in the Southern Ocean region of the Crozet Islands (52 °E, 46 °S) during the austral summer of 2004 / 2005 as part of the CROZEX project. Based on satellite imagery, a high-chlorophyll region (maximum concentration= 4 ?g l? 1) north and downstream of the islands was distinguished from a low-chlorophyll region (typical concentration= 0. 3 ?g l? 1) south and upstream of the islands. POC export estimates were obtained by using the naturally occurring particle-reactive radionuclide tracer 234 Th. POC export was initially 15 mmol C m? 2 d? 1 in the high-chlorophyll bloom region, compared with 5 mmol C m? 2 d? 1 in the low-chlorophyll, non-bloom region. After a moderately small bloom at the southern control stations (max concentration= 0. 7 ?g l? 1) the spatial variability in POC export was lost, resulting in equally high levels of POC export (ca. 20 mmol C m? 2 d? 1) throughout the study region. Comparison of 234 Th-derived POC export with estimates of new production, calculated from nitrate budgets, revealed evidence for a decoupling of new and export production, with this effect most apparent within the northern bloom area. In addition to methodological issues this apparent decoupling of new and export production could be due to a buildup of dissolved organic nitrogen within the bloom region, thus reducing the amount of POC available for export to mesopelagic depths...|$|R
40|$|The {{biological}} carbon pump (BCP) is {{a significant}} part of the global carbon cycle, exporting ? 10 Gt of particulate organic carbon (POC) out of the euphotic zone each year. However, most of the exported POC is remineralized biologically within the upper few hundred metres of the mesopelagic, above the permanent thermocline. Gaining more understanding of the factors controlling the BCP is hence important for understanding and predicting the global carbon cycle better. This thesis investigates the BCP in the Iceland Basin, and during an <b>artificial</b> ocean iron <b>fertilisation</b> experiment in the South Atlantic. In the Iceland Basin, export during a spring diatom bloom was tracked using Lagrangian sediment traps and thorium- 234 disequilibria. A large pulse of diatom detritus was exported suddenly at the end of the bloom, probably upon impending Si-limitation. The particles were rich in transparent exopolymer particles (TEP, sticky polysaccharides secreted by phytoplankton), and a comparatively large proportion (20 – 40 %) of the exported POC sank past 750 m. This shows that diatom blooms can produce rapid pulses of particle sedimentation that are transferred efficiently through the mesopelagic, and suggests that aggregation and sinking are mediated by TEP. In contrast, alleviating iron limitation in low silicic acid waters of the South Atlantic with very high copepod grazing pressure only caused a modest phytoplankton response and no enhancement of downward particle flux. This was probably primarily due to grazing control and detritus-feeding by copepods, since diatom growth rates were apparently not strongly Si-limited. This suggests that future Fe-fertilisation experiments must investigate the role of zooplankton thoroughly to distinguish beween bottom-up control of export by nutrient concentrations and top-down control by zooplankton. Export measurements based on thorium- 234 disequilibria compared well with net community production measured by O 2 :Ar ratios over the 39 d experiment, suggesting that these two methods can be meaningfully compared over ?month-long cruises. Further work was conducted with a mesoscale array of four time-series sediment traps deployed for eight moths in the Iceland Basin to study particle flux at 2000 m. Large, fast-sinking acantharian cysts contributed up to 48 % of POC flux during a specific flux event in early spring, demonstrating that the celestite shells of these protists do not necessarily dissolve in the upper mesopelagic as generally believed. The hypothesis is advanced that deep sinking of acantharian reproductive cysts during spring in this region enables juveniles to feed off seasonally sedimenting phytodetritus in the deep-sea. Finally, the full time-series of particle flux in the four deep traps was analysed. Fluxes peaked in late spring and again in mid-summer. Over the eight months, cumulative mass flux varied by 30 % between traps without corresponding variation in the cumulative flux of thorium- 230, implying genuine mesoscale variability in bathypelagic particle flux. Moreover, during any one of the two-week collection intervals total mass flux of particles varied 2 – 16 -fold between traps, although it is unclear how much of this short-term variability was due to differences in collection efficiency between traps. Overall, the traps probably under-collected thorium- 230 in absolute terms by at least 50 %, but this estimate is very uncertain...|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognised}} that some oceanic regions have persistently low chlorophyll levels, even though inorganic nutrients are plentiful. Studies have shown that these high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) areas are depleted in iron, which is an essential micronutrient for phytoplankton growth. In HNLC regions biological production can be enhanced with <b>artificial</b> mesoscale iron <b>fertilisation.</b> However, the ability of artificially induced phytoplankton blooms to efficiently sequester carbon to mesopelagic depths is still an open question. SubAntarctic islands in the HNLC Southern Ocean are a natural source of iron and thus fuel the annual phytoplankton blooms observed in their proximity. One such bloom, tied to the Crozet Islands (52 ºE, 46 ºS), provided the opportunity to examine particulate organic carbon (POC) export during the austral summer of 2004 / 5. This work was imbedded into the multi-disciplinary CROZEX project thus providing a rich context for data interpretation. Based on satellite imagery, a high chlorophyll region (max = 4 µg l- 1) north and downstream of the Crozet Islands was distinguished from a low chlorophyll region (typically 0. 3 µg l- 1) south and upstream of the islands. POC export estimates, obtained with the naturally occurring particle reactive radionuclide tracer, 234 Th, were initially D 15 mmol C m- 2 d- 1 in the high chlorophyll region, compared with D 5 mmol C m- 2 d- 1 in the low chlorophyll region. After a moderately small increase in chlorophyll in the south (max = 0. 7 µg l- 1) the spatial variability in POC export was lost, resulting in equally high levels of POC export (ca. 20 mmol C m- 2 d- 1) throughout the study area. After comparing the daily rates of POC export with temporally integrated new production calculated from nitrate budgets, a different spatial pattern emerged. New production (NP) presented consistently higher values in the north, {{when compared to the}} south. Two hypotheses were formulated to explain this, 1) dissolved organic matter (DOM) and suspended particulate organic matter (sPOM) produced from NP was stored in the mixed layer with this effect relatively greater in the north, 2) the export event in the north was longer resulting in greater seasonal POC export. Investigation of the DOM pool revealed that DOM accounted for 46 ± 7 % of NP and was consistent across the whole study area. In contrast, sPOM accumulated at differential rates of 18 ± 7 % in the north and 0 ± 7 % in the south. This suggested that differential storage of sPOM was responsible for the lack of a latitudinal gradient in POC export after the relatively small increase in chlorophyll in the south. After investigating the second hypothesis, the daily rates of POC export were scaled to seasonal integrals using a silicon budget, which allowed the formulation of a seasonal carbon budget. This revealed that over the timescale of the study the magnitude of NP and POC export were not the same with this difference greatest within the northern high chlorophyll region. This was the result of relatively greater storage of sPOM in the north and had the effect of reducing the amount of easily exportable POC to mesopelagic depths. Thus both hypotheses contributed to better understanding carbon export in the Crozet region. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Individuals are {{increasingly}} having recourse to assisted or artificial reproduction {{in order to}} realise their desire for offspring. This field is currently regulated by the National Health Act No. 61 of 2003 (NHA, or the Act) and the regulations relating to <b>artificial</b> <b>fertilisation</b> of persons, which form the framework legislation for assisted reproduction.

Matters are further complicated when the Act and the regulations have to be applied alongside legislation such as the Children’s Act No. 38 of 2005. The result is that legislation that is intended to provide legal certainty and clarity has the opposite result. This article considers the Act, its regulations and legislation that has bearing on assisted forms of reproduction.

40|$|To {{develop a}} {{protocol}} for the hormonal induction of ovulation and <b>artificial</b> <b>fertilisation</b> in Senegalese sole, {{it is necessary}} to determine whether the time of day of the GnRHa injection influences the lapsed time to ovulation or the egg quality.

The time of ovulation was 42. 5. ± 0. 6. h following hormonal treatment, and {{there were no significant differences}} between groups. However, it was noted that the time of ovulation was the most homogeneous in Groups 6 and 12, and most females in these groups ovulated at 41 or 44. h following hormonal treatment. Fertilisation rates were lower in fish injected at 19 : 00. h than in those injected at 06 : 00 or 12 : 00. h, and the largest number of larvae per kg of each female was obtained when the treatment was administered at 06 : 00.

40|$|<b>Artificial</b> <b>fertilisation</b> of {{the ocean}} has been {{proposed}} as a possible geoengineering method for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The associated increase in marine primary productivity may {{lead to an increase}} in emissions of dimethyl sulphide (DMS), the primary source of sulphate aerosol over remote ocean regions, potentially causing direct and cloud-related indirect aerosol effects on climate. This pathway from ocean fertilisation to aerosol induced cooling of the climate may provide a basis for solar radiation management (SRM) geoengineering. In this study, we investigate the transient climate impacts of two emissions scenarios: an RCP 4. 5 (Representative Concentration Pathway 4. 5) control; and an idealised scenario, based on RCP 4. 5, in which DMS emissions are substantially enhanced over ocean areas. We use mini-ensembles of a coupled atmosphere-ocean configuration of CESM 1 (CAM 5) (Community Earth System Model version 1, with the Community Atmosphere Model version 5). We find that the cooling effect associated with enhanced DMS emissions beneficially offsets greenhouse gas induced warming across most of the world. However, the rainfall response may adversely affect water resources, potentially impacting human livelihoods. These results demonstrate that changes in marine phytoplankton activity may lead to a mixture of positive and negative impacts on the climate. Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology.

40|$|In {{the last}} 20 - 30 years an {{increasing}} number of studies on lesbian parents and the development of their children has been published. PubMed/Medline was used to identify studies for inclusion in this assignment on lesbian families and the focus was review articles. There is a variety of ways of becoming a lesbian mother, and several lesbian couples have began to visit fertility clinics requesting donor insemination. The concern of the general population was that children growing up in lesbian families, and thus deprived of a father figure, had a tendency to develop abnormal sexual identity, atypical gender behavior and sexual orientation. Due to stigma of homosexuality in the society, one believed that their children were more likely to get bullied and have difficulties attaining friendships, which could lead to a higher incidence of depression and anxiety. Evidence suggest that lesbian mothers and their children are doing well, and their families are very much alike heterosexual families. The children do not seem to have more mental illnesses or gender disturbances than other children. They do not report a higher number of bullying episodes, and have several healthy social relationships. Still, lesbian women were not allowed <b>artificial</b> <b>fertilisation</b> in Norway until 01. 01. 09.

These fish, weighing initially between 190 and 1100 g were fed with a 35 - 40 % crude protein pelleted feed and followed up {{during a period of}} 16 months. Two trials of induced ovulation were also carried out on females from a small stock of a dozen adult fish reared in floating cages at the Danau Teluk fish culture station (Sumatra). Between June 1997 and October 1998, the mean body weight of fish increased from 555 g to 4162 g, which corresponded to a daily weight gain of 7. 4 /d. The highest individual growth rate observed between two successive sampling dates was of 16. 5 g/d. The mean growth rate of #P. djambal$ females (8. 9 plus or minus 2. 2 g/d) was significantly higher than that of males (6. 3 plus or minus 1. 9 g/d) and first sexual maturity occurred several months earlier in males than in females. Oocyte maturation and ovulation were induced with two successive injections of Ovaprim at 8 h interval, corresponding to a total dose of 0. 9 mL/kg. Among four females treated, three ovulated and could be stripped. Mean hatching rates obtained after <b>artificial</b> <b>fertilisation</b> of eggs varied between 8 and 31 %.

40|$|Waterbirds can {{reallocate}} {{a considerable}} amount of nutrients within agricultural fields and between agriculture sites and wetlands. However their effects on biogeochemical cycles have rarely been quantified. We estimated bird numbers, diet (from stable isotope analysis), food supply, and the food consumption on rice fields by overwintering waterbirds {{in one of the most}} important areas for rice production in southwestern Europe and a key area for various migrating and resident waterbird species. Herein, we modelled the nutrient (N and P) recycling in rice fields, and their transport to reservoirs. The energy consumption by waterbirds (96, 605 ± 18, 311 individuals) on rice fields during winter averaged at 89. 9 ± 39. 0 kJ·m- 2, with its majority (89. 9 %) belonging to foraging on rice seeds. Thus, the birds removed about 26 % of rice seeds leftover after harvest (estimated in 932. 5 ± 504. 7 seeds·m- 2 in early winter) wherein common cranes and dabbling ducks (four species) were the most important consumers. Waterbirds foraging and roosting in the rice fields recycled more than 24. 1 (1. 0 kg·ha- 1) of N and an additional 5. 0 tons (0. 2 kg·ha- 1) of P in the Extremadura's rice fields during winter. Additionally, we estimated that 2. 3 tons of N and 550 kg of P were removed from rice fields and transported to reservoirs. The seasonal foraging of wildlife should result in a direct benefit for rice farmers by improving nutrient recycling through defecation by waterbirds with respect to <b>artificial</b> <b>fertilisation.</b> Additionally, rice fields located in the cranes' core wintering areas can provide sufficient food supply to induce habitat shift from their traditional wintering habitat in ‘dehesas’ to rice fields, which causes indirect socioeconomic benefit through reduced acorn consumption by cranes.

40|$|The {{production}} of farmed Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) has increased rapidly {{over the last}} decade, and the industry is predicted {{to continue to grow}} in the coming years. One major bottleneck for this future expansion concerns the supply of viable eggs and juveniles. Hatching rates of Arctic charr eggs in aquaculture are generally much lower than for other farmed salmonids, and exhibit a large variation between individuals and years. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate current hatchery conditions and to deepen the understanding on how environmental and biological factors affect the reproductive performance of Arctic charr in routine farming. The thesis comprises four separate studies. In paper I, records of biological and environmental variables and individual egg survival data from an Arctic charr hatchery, covering a period of 12 years, were analysed in an attempt to find single and combined factors that can explain some of the variation in egg survival. Rearing temperature during summer was identified as the most critical factor for reproductive success of the current broodstock. The study also revealed strong positive relationships between female age, egg size, and egg viability, most likely enhanced by the thermal stress experienced by the broodstock. Paper II assessed broodstock rearing temperature and egg viability over a period of 28 years with focus on thermal stress in a changing climate. Mean summer water temperatures in the hatchery increased by approximately 2 °C from 1986 to 2010. The temperature increase was most evident in July but was also apparent in May, August, and September. Egg survival was most closely linked to September temperatures, which indicates that it is not necessarily the warmest days that are the most detrimental. Paper III is a study on egg incubation temperature, and the first, to my knowledge, to show that the initial stages of embryogenesis in Arctic charr are much more cold-sensitive than later in the incubation period. Incubations initiated at low temperature (2. 3 °C to 2. 8 °C) resulted in significantly higher mortality and deformity rates. Paper IV is a case study which assessed hormonal status and gamete quality of male and female Arctic charr during routine <b>artificial</b> <b>fertilisation.</b> Female plasma levels of maturation inducing hormone during stripping indicated that post-ovulation aging of oocytes can explain part of the egg loss.

40|$|Solea senegalensis is a {{promising}} species for European Aquaculture, however individuals born in captivity display a reproductive failure that hinders the sustainable culture of this species. The reproductive {{problem has been}} focused on males reared in captivity. It has been demonstrated that wild males held with captivity breed females produced viable spawns, but non viable spawns were obtained in the opposite situation (Mañanós et al., 2007, Carazo 2013). The absence of courtship is not the only reproductive problem in this species. Sperm quality is in general low, and spermatozoa show low resistance to hyperosmotic shock, high levels of DNA fragmentation, high levels of apoptotic cells and also display different and heterogeneous sperm subpopulations within the same seminal sample (Beirao et al 2009; Beirao et al 2011). The aim {{of this study is to}} implement a sperm selection method for optimal sperm subpopulation recovery. In particular, a method to eliminate apoptotic spermatozoa has been used. Annexin V binds to phosphatidylserine, which is externalized to the outer surface of the sperm membrane in early apoptosis. In this study Annexin V-MACS beads have been used for the separation of apoptotic spermatozoa. This technique has been used in sperm samples from wild and F 1 individuals. In order to confirm the efficiency of the technique, apoptotic cell population was studied by flow cytometry using YOPRO- 1 and a caspases detection kit. MATERIALS AND METHOS Sperm samples from adult Senegalese sole males (wild and F 1 broodstocks from el Bocal, IEO, Santander) were obtained by gently pressing the testes on the fish pigmented side. Ejaculates were pooled (3 - 5 males/pool) attending to similar motility parameters to avoid the influence of the sperm quality, to get volume enough to perform the study and following the routine in Aquaculture companies prior to <b>artificial</b> <b>fertilisation.</b> Each pooled sample was split into two aliquots. One of them was directly cryopreserved following the only published protocol for this species so far (Rasines et al 2013). Sperm was diluted (1 : 2 ratio) in Mounib extender with cryoprotectants (10 % BSA and 10 % DMSO), loaded into 0. 5 mL French straws, exposed to liquid nitrogen vapour during 7 min and rinsed into liquid nitrogen until used. This aliquot was considered as control in the experiment. Magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) was performed with the other aliquot using a MiniMACS separation unit (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) following manufacturer’s instructions. Magnetically labelled cells (apoptotic cells) flushed from the MS columns were discarded and the apopototic-reduced elution was cryopreserved following the same protocol as the control. Samples were thawed (37 ºC, 7 s) and washed prior to cytometer analysis. Two apoptosis detection protocols were carried out: 1) YOPRO- 1 (150 nM) (Invitrogen, Leiden, The Netherlands) and 2) CaspGLOW Fluorescein Active Caspase Staining Kit (eBioscience, San Diego, USA) following manufacture’s instructions. Both of them were co-stained with PI (2 µg/mL) (Sigma, Madrid, Spain). After the incubation time samples were analyzed twice in a FACSort Plus Analyzer (Becton–Dickinson, USA) acquiring 10000 events per replicate. The red fluorescence emitted by PI was detected using a 610 nm filter and the green fluorescence emitted by the active caspase detection kit (FITC) and YOPRO- 1 with a 516 nm filter. For each staining, significant differences between the apoptotic cell percentage (green positive/red negative cells for each protocol) between control and MACS samples were evaluated by ANOVA with a SNK (Student- Newman-Kleus) multiple range test (P < 0. 05). All statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS software (version 20. 0). RESULTS Results demonstrated that Magnetic Activated Cell sorting eliminated apoptotic cells from Solea senegalensis seminal samples. In samples obtained from captured males, apoptotic cell population significantly decreased after the process. This decrease is observed independently of the assessment method used (caspases and YO-PRO- 1). However, in F 1 individuals, only caspase-positive-cells significantly decreased after the selection. Moreover, the comparative study between seminal samples from captured and F 1 individuals showed significant differences only in caspase positive cells, being the percentage of YO-PRO- 1 positive cells similar in both cases. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that caspase determination is more specific than YO-PRO- 1 in the calculation of apoptotic cells in S. senegalensis seminal samples. The percentage of apoptotic cells (caspase positive) is, as expected, significantly higher in F 1 seminal samples. Magnetic activated cell sorting is applicable in this species for non-apoptotic spermatozoa recovery, but fertility trials must be done to confirm the real potential of the technique.

40|$|Concerns {{regarding}} the climatic {{implications of the}} increase in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations throughout the anthropocene have provided the impetus to obtain a mechanistic understanding of oceanic processes and their role in regulating atmospheric pCO 2. One important mechanism is the functioning of the biological pump which partitions carbon between the atmosphere and ocean reservoirs over relevant time scales. Current uncertainties revolve around the accuracy of upper ocean particle flux measurements, and the effect of iron and ballast minerals on the strength and efficiency of the biological carbon pump. This study documents the design and deployment of a neutrally buoyant sediment trap (PELAGRA). In the north-east Atlantic organic carbon fluxes were measured using this new technology and compared to indirect estimates of export based on 234 Th and nutrient budgets. The vertical fluxes of 234 Th into the traps were less than those estimated from the 234 Th water column budget, which is interpreted {{to be the result of}} previous export events removing 234 Th from the water column and the lateral advection of gradients of total 234 Th/ 238 U disequilibria confounding the Eulerian budgeting approach adopted. Successful simultaneous deployments in July 2006 at different depths provided a direct measurement of the attenuation of flux with depth, which at 1. 8 is substantially greater than the canonical value of 0. 856. PELAGRA deployments in the Southern Ocean were conducted as part of the CROZEX project, which examined the role of iron supply on bloom dynamics and subsequent export. Using a mass balance approach to account for the seasonal depletion of dissolved silica acid in surface waters and Si fluxes from the euphotic zone, potential surface export(100 m) of organic carbon from +Fe bloom area was estimated to be in the order of 11 - 15 g C m- 2, which is higher than previous estimates obtained from <b>artificial</b> <b>fertilisation</b> experiments. The issue of temporal decoupling between production and export processes was addressed by employing retrospective estimates of production. Particle export efficiency in the +Fe region to the north of the plateau (25 - 70 %) was higher than similar estimates in the –Fe region (11 - 20 %). Diatom size was well correlated with a range of calculated export ratios(100 m). The main diatoms involved in the export from the surface were E. Antarctica in the +Fe region and F. kerguelensis in the –Fe region. E. Antarctica fluxes also dominated deep-water (3000 m) diatom fluxes in the +Fe region, and its importance is attributed to the regions proximity to the Crozet Islands, where resting spores and dissolved iron are advected into the bloom area during the winter. Deep-water carbon fluxes measured to the south of the plateau. Deep-water carbon fluxes measured south of the plateau (0. 09 g C m- 2 yr- 1) are consistent with previous measurements in a similar environment. In the +Fe region to the north, deep water fluxes were 0. 4 g C m- 2 yr- 1 indicating that natural iron fertilisation can increase the strength of the biological carbon pump by a factor of 4. Comparison of fluxes with satellite-derived productivity also suggests that the efficiency of the biological pump in transferring organic carbon to the deep-ocean is increased by a factor of 3 in the presence of iron. The flux and composition of amino acids, in relation to the dominant mineral phases that comprised the particulate flux in the NE Atlantic and the Southern Ocean was also examined. The fraction of carbon that could be accounted for by the total hydrolysable amino acids varied very little (20 - 30 %) with sample composition. Protein amino acids were used to quantify the degradation state of the settling particulate material. Specific amino acids seem to infer diatomaceous rather than calcareous as the dominant organic matter source. Multiple linear regression analysis reveals that mineral fluxes can only explain a very small amount of the variability in amino acid composition, which does not support previous hypotheses that relate mineral fluxes and organic carbon fluxes through the differential protective capacity of various mineral phases.
