5|$|During {{his time}} in Strasbourg, Calvin was not {{attached}} to one particular church, but held his office successively in the Saint-Nicolas Church, the Sainte-Madeleine Church and the former Dominican Church, renamed the Temple Neuf. (All of these churches still exist, but none are in the architectural state of Calvin's days.) Calvin ministered to 400–500 members in his church. He preached or lectured every day, with two sermons on Sunday. Communion was celebrated monthly and congregational singing of the psalms was encouraged. He also worked on the second edition of the Institutes. Calvin was dissatisfied with its original structure as a catechism, <b>a</b> <b>primer</b> for young Christians.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, GCC {{assembled}} {{an advisory}} committee of scientific and technical experts to compile an internal-only, 17-page report on climate science entitled Predicting Future Climate Change: <b>A</b> <b>Primer,</b> which said: “The scientific basis for the Greenhouse Effect and {{the potential impact of}} human emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2 on climate is well established and cannot be denied.” In early 1996, GCC's operating committee asked the advisory committee to redact the sections that rebutted contrarian arguments, and accepted the report and distributed it to members. The draft document was disclosed in a 2007 lawsuit filed by the auto industry against California’s efforts to regulate automotive greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{detection}} of V. vulnificus in shellfish via competitive PCR was herein developed. We designed <b>a</b> forward <b>primer,</b> <b>a</b> reverse <b>primer</b> and <b>a</b> hybrid forward <b>primer</b> {{based on the}} V. vulnificus specific hemolysin gene (vvh), which was used to amplify target DNA and an internal competitive PCR standard. The specificity of the primers for V. vulnificus was proven by gel electrophoresis. The detection sensitivity for V. vulnificus was 220 CFU per PCR reaction with cells from a pure culture and 270 CFU/g of tissue without enrichment. After 10 hours of enrichment at 37 ° C the minimum detection level was reduced to 7 CFU/g of tissue...|$|R

25|$|Because DNA {{polymerase}}s require <b>a</b> <b>primer</b> {{on which}} to begin DNA synthesis, polymerase α (Pol α) acts as a replicative primase. Pol α is associated with an RNA primase and this complex accomplishes the priming task by synthesizing <b>a</b> <b>primer</b> that contains a short 10 nucleotide stretch of RNA followed by 10 to 20 DNA bases. Importantly, this priming action occurs at replication initiation at origins to begin leading-strand synthesis and also at the 5' end of each Okazaki fragment on the lagging strand.|$|E

50|$|MLPA {{facilitates}} the amplification and detection of multiple targets with <b>a</b> single <b>primer</b> pair. In <b>a</b> standard multiplex PCR reaction, each fragment needs <b>a</b> unique amplifying <b>primer</b> pair. These primers being {{present in a}} large quantity result in various problems such as dimerization and false priming. With MLPA, amplification of probes can be achieved. Thus, many sequences (up to 40) can be amplified and quantified using just <b>a</b> single <b>primer</b> pair. MLPA reaction is fast, inexpensive and very simple to perform.|$|R
