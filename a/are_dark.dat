5|$|Streaks {{are common}} across Mars and new ones appear {{frequently}} on steep slopes of craters, troughs, and valleys. The streaks <b>are</b> <b>dark</b> {{at first and}} get lighter with age. The streaks can start in a tiny area, then spread out for hundreds of metres. They have been seen to follow the edges of boulders and other obstacles in their path. The commonly accepted theories include that they <b>are</b> <b>dark</b> underlying layers of soil revealed after avalanches of bright dust or dust devils. Several other explanations have been put forward, including those that involve water or even the growth of organisms.|$|E

5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins are as long {{or longer}} than the head, with a nearly straight front margin and broad tips. The first dorsal fin is large with a rounded apex, and is placed behind the pectoral fins. The second dorsal and anal fins are tiny. The caudal peduncle is expanded laterally into strong keels. The caudal fin is crescent-shaped, with a small notch near {{the tip of the}} upper lobe. The dermal denticles are elliptical, longer than wide, with three to seven horizontal ridges leading to a toothed posterior margin. The coloration is dark blue to grayish black above and white below. The unpaired fins <b>are</b> <b>dark</b> except for a white rear margin on the anal fin; the pectoral and pelvic fins <b>are</b> <b>dark</b> above and white below with sharp gray posterior margins. In adults and large juveniles, the area beneath the snout, around the jaw, and the origin of the pectoral fins have dusky mottling.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} many Cortinarius species {{with some degree of}} violet colour, C.violaceus and its close {{relatives}} are easily distinguished by their much darker purple colour. Cortinarius iodes of the southeastern United States has a slimy purple cap and paler violet stipe. The other species in the section Cortinarius <b>are</b> <b>dark</b> purple and superficially similar, but can be differentiated based on host and geography as they do not occur in the same locations as C. violaceus. Certain Leptonia species in northwestern North America, including L. carnea and L. nigroviolacea, have a similar color, but are easily differentiated due to their pink spore print.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter trojans <b>are</b> <b>dark</b> {{bodies with}} reddish, featureless spectra. No firm {{evidence}} {{of the presence of}} water, or any other specific compound on their surface has been obtained, but it is thought that they are coated in tholins, organic polymers formed by the Sun's radiation. The Jupiter trojans' densities (as measured by studying binaries or rotational lightcurves) vary from 0.8 to 2.5g·cm−3. Jupiter trojans are thought to have been captured into their orbits during {{the early stages of the}} Solar System's formation or slightly later, during the migration of giant planets.|$|E
5|$|Licancabur has erupted {{primarily}} andesite, but basaltic andesite and dacite {{have also}} been found. The rocks <b>are</b> <b>dark</b> and grey-coloured. Basaltic andesite {{was found in the}} older lavas, and dacite in the more-recent ones. Although the rocks have a seriate texture, the groundmass is hyalopilitic. Phenocrysts include amphibole, clinopyroxene, hornblende, orthopyroxene, plagioclase and titanomagnetite; olivine is found in andesite, and biotite in dacites. Plagioclase is the most common. The amount of phenocrysts in Licancabur's rocks is smaller than that in other Central Volcanic Zone volcanoes, such as Lascar.|$|E
5|$|Long, highly {{sensitive}} whiskers and front paws help the sea otter find prey by touch when waters <b>are</b> <b>dark</b> or murky. Researchers have noted when they approach in plain view, sea otters react more rapidly {{when the wind}} is blowing towards the animals, indicating the sense of smell is more important than sight as a warning sense. Other observations indicate the sea otter's sense of sight is useful above and below the water, although not as good as that of seals. Its hearing is neither particularly acute nor poor.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 17-18 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> rather <b>dark</b> fuscous. The discal stigmata <b>are</b> obscurely <b>darker</b> {{and with}} the extreme costal edge sometimes whitish posteriorly. The terminal edge <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> fuscous. The hindwings are grey.|$|R
2500|$|The Great Red Spot varies {{greatly in}} hue, from almost brick-red to pale salmon, or even white. In fact, the spot {{occasionally}} [...] "disappears", becoming evident {{only through the}} Red Spot Hollow, which is its niche in the South Equatorial Belt (SEB). Interestingly, its visibility is apparently coupled to the SEB; when the belt is bright white, the spot tends to <b>be</b> <b>dark,</b> and when it <b>is</b> <b>dark,</b> the spot <b>is</b> usually light. These periods when the spot <b>is</b> <b>dark</b> or light occur at irregular intervals; as of 1997, during the preceding 50 years, the spot <b>was</b> <b>darkest</b> in the periods 1961–1966, 1968–1975, 1989–1990, and 1992–1993.|$|R

5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse is a {{terrestrial}} rodent {{with short}} forelimbs and long hindfeet. With a head and body length of 150mm (5.9in) and body mass of 105g (3.7oz) {{in the only}} known complete specimen, it is much larger than M.bastardi, and its measurements fall {{at or above the}} upper end of the known range of variation in M.ingens. The upperparts are covered with soft and short, brown fur. Most cover hairs (the main part of the fur) <b>are</b> <b>dark</b> brown for the two-thirds closest to the base, then light brown, with a short dark brown tip. The middle of the back appears darker, because the cover hairs there are entirely dark brown. The hairs are 6 to 8mm (0.2 to 0.3in) long on the shoulders and 7 to 9mm (0.3 to 0.4in) on the back. The guard hairs are gray. Because the flanks lack entirely dark cover hairs, they are slightly lighter than the rest of the upperparts. They are sharply separated in color from the underparts, which are entirely white to buffish. The mystacial vibrissae (whiskers above the mouth) are long, up to 60mm (2.4in), and white or black in color. The pinnae (external ears) <b>are</b> <b>dark</b> brown and covered with fine gray hairs, and ear length is 32mm (1.3in).|$|E
5|$|Rare colours {{can appear}} {{unexpectedly}} in certain lines, for instance while an all-white cocker is usually bred by selective breeding of very light golden strains, {{they can still}} appear very uncommonly to parents who <b>are</b> <b>dark</b> colored.

5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any {{treatment}} prior to planting, and take 26 to 40 days to germinate. Seeds that grow into yellow-flowered plants are pale and unpigmented, while future bronze- and red-flowered plants <b>are</b> <b>dark</b> greyish and black respectively. It generally takes about {{five to seven years}} to flower from seed. The plant favours sandy well-drained soils and a sunny position and can be heavily pruned if necessary, as new growth can arise from the lignotuber.
