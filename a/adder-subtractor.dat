It addresses the minimization {{of the number}} of <b>adder-subtractors</b> used in the hardware implementation of a FIR filter (Multiple Constant Multiplication problem). The method is based on identification and elimination of n-bit pattern common subexpressions in a set of filter coefficients by means of an exhaustive search. We give an algorithm description of our solution and demonstrate the performance on selected examples. A comparison of the results obtained by other authors is made and finally optimization and synthesis results on a realistic example, a 64 -tap root-raised-cosine filter with 10 bit CSD coefficients is given.

40|$|Reversible {{circuits}} {{are similar}} to conventional logic circuits except that they are built from reversible gates. In reversible gates, there is a unique, one-to-one mapping between the inputs and outputs, {{not the case with}} conventional logic. Also, reversible gates require constant ancilla inputs for reconfiguration of gate functions and garbage outputs that help in keeping reversibility. Reversible circuits hold promise in futuristic computing technologies like quantum computing, quantum dot cellular automata, DNA computing, optical computing, etc. Thus, it is important to minimize parameters such as ancilla and garbage bits, quantum cost and delay in the design of reversible circuits. The first contribution of this dissertation is the design of a new reversible gate namely the TR gate (Thapliyal-Ranganathan) which has the unique structure that makes it ideal for the realization of arithmetic circuits such as adders, subtractors and comparators, efficient in terms of the parameters such as ancilla and garbage bits, quantum cost and delay. The second contribution is the development of design methodologies and a synthesis framework to synthesize reversible data path functional units, such as binary and BCD adders, subtractors, <b>adder-subtractors</b> and binary comparators. The objective behind the proposed design methodologies is to synthesize arithmetic and logic functional units optimizing key metrics such as ancilla inputs, garbage outputs, quantum cost and delay. A library of reversible gates such as the Fredkin gate, the Toffoli gate, the TR gate, etc. was developed by coding in Verilog for use during synthesis. The third contribution of this dissertation is the set of methodologies for the design of reversible sequential circuits such as reversible latches, flip-flops and shift registers. The reversible designs of asynchronous set/reset D latch and the D flip-flop are attempted for the first time. It is shown that the designs are optimal in terms of number of garbage outputs while exploring the best possible values for quantum cost and delay. The other important contributions of this dissertation are the applications of reversible logic as well as a special class of reversible logic called conservative reversible logic towards concurrent (online) and offline testing of single as well as multiple faults in traditional and reversible nanoscale VLSI circuits, based on emerging nanotechnologies such as QCA, quantum computing, etc. Nanoelectronic devices tend to have high permanent and transient faults and thus are susceptible to high error rates. Specific contributions include (i) concurrently testable sequential circuits for molecular QCA based on reversible logic, (ii) concurrently testable QCA-based FPGA, (iii) design of self checking conservative logic gates for QCA, (iv) concurrent multiple error detection in emerging nanotechnologies using reversible logic, (v) two-vectors, all 0 s and all 1 s, testable reversible sequential circuits...|$|R

In this paper, a novel efficient full <b>adder–subtractor</b> in QCA nanotechnology is proposed. First, one bit full adder with minimum delay cell is designed. Then the proposed full adder is used to design an efficient full <b>adder–subtractor</b> with minimum number of cells. The proposed circuit does not need any rotated cells and only uses one layer. Therefore, manufacturability of the design significantly improves.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{hardware}} circuit {{has been proposed}} for evaluating value of a term {{in the form of}} xi easily,where x is the prime base and i is the exponent. Using greedy algorithm a large integer number can be represented by the multiplication of various prime numbers and each of the prime number may be in the form of xi. Without taking the general approach of multiplication for finding out the result of xi, the new and simple approach has been adopted. Certain pattern has been shown by detail study of the binary form of the prime basesand its exponent. Instead of multiply the prime base x with i times with itself, it can be possible to calculate the xi by performing simple logical shifts, addition or subtraction operations. Those operations are similar in nature. To calculate the exponent part, set of some similar operations have been performed repeatedly. The proposed circuit has been implemented by decoder, shift register, <b>adder-subtractor,</b> lookup table, counter and tri-state buffer. Exponent part of each of the prime base x has been computed by this common circuit by selecting appropriate similar type of operations by the help of the lookup table. Due to the fixed size of shift register and <b>adder-subtractor,</b> finite range of operations of the exponent of the corresponding prime base x has been computed with this proposed hardware circuit...|$|E

In reality these quantities depend on the number of digits these units are designed to process simultaneously.

The core of this paper consist of the introduction of a novel and high performance design of an 8 x 8 multiplier using ancient Indian mathematics called Vedas. This paper presents four different designs which includes 8 x 8 Vedic multiplier and 8 x 8 array multiplier implementation using CMOS and Hybrid PTL / CMOS logic style and finally proved that Hybrid PTL(Pass Transistor Logic) /CMOS design of Vedic Multiplier is the best among all these implementations. The multiplier and the <b>adder-subtractor</b> units used for the implementation of Vedic multiplier are adopted from ancient methodology of India mathematics called as Vedas.
