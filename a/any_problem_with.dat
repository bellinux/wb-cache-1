25|$|Within {{the late}} Roman military, many {{recruits}} and even officers had barbarian origins, and soldiers are recorded as using possibly-barbarian rituals such as elevating a claimant on shields.

500|$|In a 2006 {{interview}} with Wizard magazine, Moore was also critical about {{his decision to}} cripple Barbara Gordon: [...] "I asked DC if they had <b>any</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> me crippling Barbara Gordon - who was Batgirl at the time - and if I remember, I spoke to Len Wein, who was our editor on the project... said, 'Yeah, okay, cripple the bitch.'

500|$|The {{reliability}} of the ZX81 was controversial. W.H. Smith, one of the machine's key distributors, had a company policy of ordering a third more ZX81s than were actually required for sale, {{so that it would}} have enough replacements for faulty machines. Similar problems were reported in the US market, where contemporary reports suggested that only a third of the ZX81s shipped actually worked. However, figures released by Sinclair claimed that only 2.4 per cent of pre-assembled machines were returned, although 13 per cent of kits were returned.

500|$|Retired Test umpires Col Hoy and Les Townsend were {{watching}} {{at the ground}} when Meckiff was called. The day after the incident, both asserted {{that they would not}} have no-balled the paceman. Hoy said he had never had <b>any</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the bowler's action during matches in which he officiated. He described Meckiff's action as [...] "slightly different" [...] but attributed this to an accentuated wrist action used in an attempt to get more life out of dead pitches, rather than his elbow. Townsend watched the paceman through binoculars and deemed all of his 12 deliveries to be identical. Townsend regarded Meckiff's arm action as [...] "peculiar" [...] but felt he did not throw. Former Test spinners Ian Johnson and Doug Ring said Meckiff's action was fair.|$|E
500|$|DC officially retired {{the hero}} in the {{one-shot}} comic Batgirl Special #1 (July 1988), written by Barbara Kesel. Later that year, she appears in Alan Moore's Batman: The Killing Joke. In this graphic novel, the Joker shoots and paralyzes Barbara Gordon {{in an attempt to}} drive her father insane, thereby proving to Batman that anyone can be morally compromised. While the events in The Killing Joke exert a great impact on the character, the story {{has little to do with}} her. She is deployed as a plot device to cement the Joker’s vendetta against Commissioner Gordon and Batman. In 2006, during an interview with Wizard, Moore expressed regret over his treatment of the character calling it [...] "shallow and ill-conceived". He stated prior to writing the graphic novel, [...] "I asked DC if they had <b>any</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> me crippling Barbara Gordon—who was Batgirl at the time—and if I remember, I spoke to Len Wein, who was our editor on the project", and following a discussion with then-Executive Editorial Director Dick Giordano, [...] "Len got back onto the phone and said, ‘Yeah, okay, cripple the bitch.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Brundage quickly {{displayed}} what writer Roger Butterfield in a 1948 {{article for}} Life magazine termed [...] "a dictatorial temperament." [...] In 1929, American track star Charlie Paddock stated that Brundage and other sports officials were making {{money for the}} AOC by using him as a gate attraction, while treating him badly; Brundage shot back accusing Paddock of [...] "untruths" [...] and [...] "sensationalism of the rankest sort". The runner turned professional, escaping Brundage's jurisdiction. In 1932, soon after winning three medals at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, track star Mildred [...] "Babe" [...] Didrikson appeared in an automobile advertisement, and the Brundage-led AAU quickly suspended her amateur status. Didrikson objected {{that she had not}} been paid and that regardless, the rules for maintaining amateur status were overcomplex. In the first of several well-publicized run-ins he had with female athletes, Brundage replied that he had not had <b>any</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the rules when an Olympic athlete himself, and stated, [...] "You know, the ancient Greeks kept women out of their athletic games. They wouldn't even let them on the sidelines. I'm not so sure but they were right." [...] According to Butterfield, Brundage was suspicious of female athletes, suspecting that some were actually men in disguise.|$|E

[...] Although there has been speculation as to whether or not editors at DC specifically intended to have the character's paralysis become permanent, Brian Cronin, author of Was Superman A Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed (2009) noted that DC had hired Barbara Kesel to write the Batgirl Special specifically to retire the character and set her in place for The Killing Joke.|$|E

Therefore, it is most likely that the pilots of flight 2311 did not notice a problem with the airplane until the propeller began to overspeed and roll control was affected." [...] Thus, the flight crew would have been unable to declare an emergency as the event was so sudden.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, Lantos, {{who was on}} the House Committee on International Affairs, took Colette Avital, a Labor Party {{member of}} the Israeli Knesset, by the hand and, {{according}} to Haaretz, tried to reassure her with these words: [...] "My dear Colette, don't worry.

2500|$|In a San Francisco Chronicle {{article on}} January 13, 2008, People's Park was {{referred}} to as [...] "a menacing hub for drug users and the homeless" [...] and also as [...] "perfectly safe, clean and accessible".

2500|$|Such {{views are}} also shared by former CIA {{director}} James Woolsey who {{said in a}} 1999 Congressional Statement: [...] "I have been particularly concerned for some years, beginning during my tenure, with the interpenetration of Russian organized crime, Russian intelligence and law enforcement, and Russian business. I have often illustrated this point with the following hypothetical: If you should chance to {{strike up a conversation}} with an articulate, English-speaking Russian in, say, the restaurant of one of the luxury hotels along Lake Geneva, and he is wearing a $3,000 suit and a pair of Gucci loafers, and he tells you that he is an executive of a Russian trading company and {{wants to talk to you}} about a joint venture, then there are four possibilities. He may be what he says he is. He may be a Russian intelligence officer working under commercial cover. He may be part of a Russian organized crime group.
