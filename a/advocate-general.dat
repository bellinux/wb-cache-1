5|$|In 1858, {{under the}} terms of Queen's Proclamation issued by Queen Victoria, the Madras Presidency, {{along with the rest of}} British India, came under the direct rule of the British crown. During the period of {{governor}} Lord Harris (1854–1859), measures were taken to improve education and increase representation of Indians in the administration. Legislative powers were given to the Governor's council under the Indian Councils Act 1861. The council was reformed and expanded under the Indian Councils Act 1892, the Indian Councils Act 1909, the Government of India Act 1919, and the Government of India Act 1935. V. Sadagopacharlu (1861–63) was the first Indian to be appointed to the council. The legal profession was specially prized by the newly emerging corpus of educated Indians. In 1877, T. Muthuswamy Iyer became the first Indian judge of the Madras High Court despite strong opposition from the Anglo-Indian media. He also acted as the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court for a few months in 1893, thereby becoming the first Indian to hold the post. In 1906, C. Sankaran Nair became the first Indian to be appointed <b>Advocate-General</b> of the Madras Presidency. A number of roads, railways, dams and canals were constructed during this period.|$|E

25|$|Srinivasa Iyengar {{was born}} in the Ramanathapuram {{district}} of Madras Presidency. He graduated in law and practised as a lawyer in the Madras High Court rising to become <b>Advocate-General</b> in 1916. He also served {{as a member of the}} bar council and was nominated as the law member of the Governor's executive council. He resigned his <b>Advocate-General</b> post, his seat in the Governor's executive council and returned his C. I. E. in 1920 in protest against the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and joined the Indian National Congress. He participated in the Non-Cooperation Movement. However, in 1923, he broke away along with other leaders as Motilal Nehru and Chittaranjan Das due to differences with Mahatma Gandhi over participating in elections. The breakaway faction later formed the Swarajya Party. Iyengar served as the President of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee and later, the Madras Province Swarajya Party and was the leader of the party when it refused to form the government in the province despite winning a majority in the 1926 elections. In later life, he established the Independence of India league and organised protests against the Simon Commission. He retired from politics due to differences with other Congress politicians over the goal of Dominion status. He briefly returned to politics in 1938. On 19 May 1941, Iyengar died in his house in Madras.|$|E
25|$|The {{outcome was}} not {{a vote in the}} Commons, but a kind of truce until, in August 1874, Gladstone {{transferred}} Ayrton from the Board of Works to the office of Judge <b>Advocate-General,</b> just before his government fell. Ayrton failed to get re-elected to Parliament. From that moment to this, the value of the Botanic Gardens has never been seriously questioned. In the midst of this crisis, Hooker was elected as President of the Royal Society in 1873. This showed publicly the high regard which Hooker's fellow scientists had for him, and the great importance they attached to his work.|$|E

25|$|The first Indian Councils Act of 1861 {{set up the}} Madras Legislative Council as an {{advisory}} body through which the colonial administration obtained advice and assistance. The Act empowered the provincial Governor to nominate four non-English Indian members to the council for the first time. Under the Act, the nominated members were allowed to move their own bills and vote on bills introduced in the council. However, they {{were not allowed to}} question the executive, move resolutions or examine the budget. Also they could not interfere with the laws passed by the Central Legislature. The Governor was also the president of the Council and he had complete authority over when, where and how long to convene the Council and what to discuss. Two members of his Executive Council and the <b>Advocate-General</b> of Madras were also allowed to participate and vote in the Council. The Indians nominated under this Act were mostly zamindars and ryotwari landowners, who often benefited from their association with the colonial government. Supportive members were often re-nominated for several terms. G. N. Ganapathy Rao was nominated eight times, Humayun Jah Bahadur was a member for 23 years, T. Rama Rao and P. Chentsal Rao were members for six years each. Other prominent members during the period included V. Bhashyam Aiyangar, S. Subramania Iyer and C. Sankaran Nair. The Council met infrequently and in some years (1874 and 1892) was not convened even once. The maximum of number of times it met in a year was eighteen. The Governor preferred to convene the Council at his summer retreat Udagamandalam, much to the displeasure of the Indian members. The few times when the Council met, it was for only a few hours with bills and resolutions being rushed through.|$|E

The hearing was conducted by Frederick Solly Flood, Attorney General of Gibraltar who was also <b>Advocate-General</b> and Proctor for the Queen in Her Office of Admiralty. Flood was described by a historian of the Mary Celeste affair as a man [...] "whose arrogance and pomposity were inversely proportional to his IQ", and as [...] "...the sort of man who, once he had {{made up his mind}} about something, couldn't be shifted." [...] The testimonies of Deveau and Wright convinced Flood unalterably that a crime had been committed, a belief picked up by the New York Shipping and Commercial List on December 21: [...] "The inference is that there has been foul play somewhere, and that alcohol is at the bottom of it." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 19 June 1990 the ECJ court (as [...] "full court" [...] of 11 justices) en banc {{gave its}} ruling, rephrasing the {{question}} posed as [...] "whether a national court which, {{in a case}} before it concerning Community law, considers that the sole obstacle which precludes it from granting interim relief is a rule of national law, must disapply that rule". Following the <b>Advocate-General's</b> opinion, the ECJ held that a national court, in fact, {{has a duty to}} grant interim relief to safeguard alleged Community rights of individuals until the decision of the ECJ on the interpretation of Community law is available, and where a rule of national law would deny such relief, to set aside that rule. The basis of such a duty lies in the nature and object of directly effective Community law rights which are intended to be fully effective throughout the EU, and where, in order to safeguard such a right, it is necessary to grant interim measures, a national court must do so. This is especially true where a national court is awaiting a clarification or interpretation of the right claimed by the ECJ.|$|R
40|$|Imagine a state {{proclaiming that}} it will claim {{jurisdiction}} over, and apply its laws to, any website that can be accessed from a computer located in its territory. The response would perhaps be outrage from some. Others would point to the ineffective nature of such a rule, and yet others would perhaps view the model as infeasible. Indeed, when the <b>Advocate-General’s</b> office of Minnesota in the mid 90 ’s issued a statement that: ‘[p]ersons outside of Minnesota who transmit information via the Internet knowing that information will be disseminated in Minnesota are subject to jurisdiction in Minnesota courts for violations of state criminal and civil laws’, it was met with strong criticism. Against this background, persons unfamiliar with private international law (or as the discipline is referred to in common law systems, conflict of laws) might {{be surprised to find}} that many, not to say most, states’ private international law rules do in fact provide for jurisdictional claims over any website that can be accessed in its territory, in relation {{to a wide range of}} legal matters. Similarly, many, not to say most, states’ private international law rules do provide for the court to apply the law of the state where the court is located in many situations where jurisdiction is being exercised over a foreign website. This article examines the issues associated with the application of private international law to online activities. In doing so, the four interconnected elements of private international law; jurisdiction, choice of law, the courts’ option of declining jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement are examined. Examples and experiences are primarily drawn from Australia, and particular focus is placed on the Internet defamation dispute between US publishing giant, Dow Jones 2 ̆ 6 Company Inc, and Victorian businessman, Joseph Gutnick. However, non-Australian materials, particularly from the European Union (i. e. community instruments), the People’s Republic of China and the United States of America, are relied upon...|$|R

Unhappy with the conditions, at 07:00 on 14 May around 260 privates grouped together {{and refused to}} disperse when ordered {{to do so by}} the orderly officer. The commanding officer then spoke to the men and ordered them to return to duty, which they again refused to do. That afternoon the commanding general arrived and spoke to them. They were then ordered to fall in and when they failed to comply, 258 men were taken into military custody. A Court of Inquiry was held which decided the 258 men were to stand trial for mutiny. In the trial, three men were acquitted, eight were sentenced to five years' penal servitude and discharged from the army, and the rest were given two years imprisonment with hard labour and discharged. Two days after sentencing, the Secretary of State for War quashed all the convictions, stating that the Judge <b>Advocate-General</b> had advised him that there were, [...] "a number of irregularities of a substantial nature which may well have prejudiced the accused individually. These irregularities in his opinion rendered the trial as a whole so unsatisfactory that the convictions ought not to be allowed to stand." ...|$|E
