McCaskill grilled top officials of the military's auditing <b>agencies</b> <b>for</b> <b>rewarding</b> KBR <b>for</b> their Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) contract, a contract now valued at over $20 billion, despite audit reports indicating extreme contractor mismanagement and expansive overcharging of the U.S. government. She has {{been critical of the}} DoD's auditors, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, based on a recent GAO report that alleges that audits were not properly supported or supervised, and in some cases been changed by managers in order to appease the procurement community and/or the audited contractor.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to measure the effects of task difficulty and reward opportunity on motivation. The participants, 20 undergraduate students, were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four experimental conditions: reward opportunity-hard proofreading task, reward opportunity-easy proofreading task, no reward opportunity-hard proofreading task, or no reward opportunity-easy proofreading task. It was hypothesized that the participants offered an opportunity <b>for</b> <b>reward</b> would perform better than those not offered an opportunity <b>for</b> <b>reward</b> by indicating and correcting more spelling and grammatical errors. Also, it was hypothesized that participants offered an opportunity <b>for</b> <b>reward</b> would return the completed proofreading task quicker than participants not offered an opportunity <b>for</b> <b>reward.</b> Two, 2 x 2 ANOVAs were carried out with the results showing no main effects of task difficulty or opportunity <b>for</b> <b>reward</b> on number of errors corrected or time of return (in days), indicating no change in motivation. As the original hypothesis was not supported, issues with the study and areas for further research were discussed...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. Statistics {{on private}} road freight {{transportation}} services (not <b>for</b> <b>reward)</b> (defined as: “a business’s own vehicles {{that are used}} to transport its own products to its own customers”) are very limited in South Africa. Statistics South Africa’s (SSA) research focuses on road freight carriers <b>for</b> <b>reward</b> and excludes the data on private (not <b>for</b> <b>reward)</b> carriers. The CSIR in 2004 published a report entitled Second Annual State of Logistics Survey for South Africa. The focus of this study was on land freight transport, i. e. road and rail. Maritime, air and pipeline volumes were not included in this study’s scope. Therefore, the number of studies investigating the private (not <b>for</b> <b>reward)</b> road freight market and even the total freight market in South Africa is limited to the above-mentioned two sources and the Rand Afrikaans University’s (RAU) 1991 -study (published in 1993), entitled Freight Transport Survey.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{evolution}} and the co-evolution of both characteristics of reciprocity- {{the willingness to}} reward friendly behavior and the willingness to punish hostile behavior. Firstly, both preferences <b>for</b> <b>rewarding</b> and preferences <b>for</b> punishing can survive in evolution provided individuals interact within separate groups. This holds even with randomly formed groups and even when individual preferences are unobservable. Secondly, preferences <b>for</b> <b>rewarding</b> survive only in coexistence with self-interested preferences, but preferences for punishing tend either to vanish or to dominate the population entirely. Finally, the evolution of preferences <b>for</b> <b>rewarding</b> {{and the evolution of}} preferences for punishing influence each other decisively. The existence of rewarders enhances the evolutionary success of punishers, but punishers crowd out rewarders...|$|R
