This includes, but is not limited exclusively to, those ships which participated in, and in support of convoys to North Russia.

25|$|The {{qualification}} {{requirement for}} the award of the War Medal 1939–1945 to full-time military personnel was 28 days of service, wherever rendered. Qualifying service in the Merchant Navy was 28 days of service <b>anywhere</b> <b>at</b> sea during the qualifying period. Foreign subjects commissioned or enlisted into British Forces, who did not receive a similar award to the War Medal 1939–1945 from their own Governments, were also eligible {{to qualify for the}} award of this medal.|$|E
25|$|In 991 the Vikings sacked Ipswich, {{and their}} fleet made {{landfall}} near Maldon in Essex. The Danes {{demanded that the}} English pay a ransom, but the English commander Byrhtnoth refused; {{he was killed in}} the ensuing Battle of Maldon, and the English were easily defeated. From then on the Vikings seem to have raided <b>anywhere</b> <b>at</b> will; they were contemptuous of the lack of resistance from the English. Even the Alfredian systems of burhs failed. Æthelred seems to have just hidden, out of range of the raiders.|$|E

25|$|In addition, many NA {{groups were}} not {{following}} the 12 traditions very closely (which were quite new at the time). These groups were at times accepting money from outside entities, conflating AA with NA, or even adding religious elements to the meetings. For {{a variety of}} reasons, meetings began to decline in the late 1950s, {{and there was a}} four-month period in 1959 when there were no meetings held <b>anywhere</b> <b>at</b> all. Spurred into action by this, Kinnon and others dedicated themselves to restarting NA, promising to hold to the traditions more closely.|$|E
25|$|The {{duration}} of the Second World War in Europe was from 3 September 1939 to 8 May 1945, while in the Pacific Theatre it continued until 2 September 1945. The War Medal 1939–1945 was instituted by the United Kingdom on 16 August 1945 and was awarded to all full-time personnel {{of the armed forces}} and merchant marines for serving for 28 days, irrespective of where they were serving, between 3 September 1939 and 2 September 1945 inclusive, the full {{duration of}} the Second World War. In the Merchant Navy, the 28 days had to have been served <b>anywhere</b> <b>at</b> sea.|$|E
25|$|Interscan {{proved to}} have many {{advantages}} over other precision landing systems. It allows {{a wide selection of}} channels to avoid interference with other nearby airports; has excellent performance in all weather; and gives freedom to locate antennae <b>anywhere</b> <b>at</b> an airport. Some installations became operational in the 1990s and more were set up subsequently in Europe. NASA has operated a similar system to land space shuttles. However, Interscan has not become widely deployed worldwide, largely because the US Federal Aviation Administration has developed the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), which augments the satellite-based Global Positioning System (GPS). Although WAAS is cheaper and conforms to ILS Category I, its accuracy is under 1.0 metre laterally and under 1.5 metres vertically, which is a particular concern at locations that frequently suffer from low visibility.|$|E

500|$|Madman's Drum is a {{more ambitious}} work than Gods' Man, with a larger cast of {{characters}} and more complicated plot. [...] The book is more explicit in its far-leftist politics, and includes a subplot in which the main character's sister's communist lover is executed for his political beliefs.

500|$|Some {{people still}} {{incorrectly}} believe that opening windows {{ahead of a}} tornado will reduce the damage from the storm, {{but this is not}} true. Some people also believe that escaping in a vehicle is the safest method of avoiding a tornado, but this could increase the danger in some situations. Other myths are that tornadoes can skip houses, always travel in a predictable direction, always extend visibly from the ground to the cloud, and increase in intensity with increasing width. Finally, some people believe that tornadoes only occur in North America, do not occur in winter, are attracted to trailer park homes, or that some areas are protected from tornadoes by rivers, mountains, valleys, tall buildings or other geographical or man-made features; the truth is that tornadoes can occur almost <b>anywhere</b> <b>at</b> any time if the conditions are right. [...] Some geographic areas are simply more prone to these conditions than others.|$|E

Ejiofor's role was confirmed during the 2015 D23 Expo. In April, Derrickson and members of the production team visited New York City to scout potential filming locations, while Feige revealed that filming would begin that November. A month later, Tilda Swinton was in talks to play the Ancient One. In June 2015, Derrickson announced {{that he was going to}} London to begin work on the film, and Feige confirmed that Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum would appear, located on Bleecker Street in New York City's Greenwich Village, as in the comics. Swinton confirmed her role in the film in July, when Rachel McAdams was being considered for the female lead. McAdams cautioned that [...] "it's still super-early, and I don't know where that's gonna go, if it's gonna go <b>anywhere</b> <b>at</b> all", but she ultimately confirmed her role during the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival.

500|$|The date of Thored's {{death is}} uncertain, but his last {{historical}} appearance {{came in the}} Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, recension C (D, E), under the year 992, which reported the death of Archbishop Oswald and an expedition against a marauding Scandinavian fleet: In this year the holy Archbishop Oswald left this life and attained the heavenly life, and Ealdorman Æthelwine [...] died in the same year. Then the king and all his counsellors decreed that all the ships that were any use should be assembled at London. And the king then entrusted the expedition to the leadership of Ealdorman Ælfric (of Hampshire), Earl Thored and Bishop Ælfstan [...] and Bishop Æscwig , and they were to try if they could entrap the Danish army <b>anywhere</b> <b>at</b> sea. Then Ealdorman Ælfric sent someone to warn the enemy, {{and then in the}} night before the day on which they were to have joined battle, he absconded by night from the army, to his own disgrace, and then the enemy escaped, except that the crew of one ship was slain. And then the Danish army encountered the ships from East Anglia and from London, and they made a great slaughter there and captured the ship, all armed and equipped, on which the ealdorman was.|$|E

500|$|The Boers countered on 7February {{with a much}} heavier 100-pounder named [...] "Long Tom"; it {{had been}} {{disabled}} by British saboteurs at Ladysmith, before being repaired at Pretoria, and brought to Kimberley. [...] In addition to having larger shells {{than any of the}} siege guns used up to that point, its longer range meant that it could also target any location in Kimberley. [...] The town's inhabitants had become accustomed to shelling by smaller guns and were to some extent able to take shelter and to carry on their daily lives. [...] The new gun immediately changed the status quo, as terrified residents were no longer able to find sanctuary <b>anywhere</b> <b>at</b> ground level. [...] Rhodes published a notice inviting people to take shelter in the Kimberley Mine in order to avoid its lethal shelling. [...] Fortunately for the defenders, the gun did not use smokeless powder, so observers were able to give residents up to 17seconds warning to take cover when a shell was incoming. [...] Labram was the most notable civilian casualty, when he was killed within a week {{of the end of the}} siege, ironically by a Boer shell from the Long Tom gun brought to counter his own gun. [...] Kekewich arranged a full military funeral for him, which was well attended, but took place after dark for safety reasons; the procession was targeted by Boer shelling with the help of a traitor inside the town who lit the area with a flare.|$|E

To obtain reliable information in the same environment <b>anywhere</b> and <b>at</b> any time, the introduction of a Server-Based Computing (SBC) system is promising, because a SBC system accumulates and processes information in the one place. Cellular phones are also useful as terminals to easily achieve information access <b>anywhere</b> and <b>at</b> any time. To achieve an SBC system for cellular phones that can operate comfortably, we propose a light-weight protocol called the “UI component oriented protocol ” and a function of speculative execution based on the prediction of user events.
