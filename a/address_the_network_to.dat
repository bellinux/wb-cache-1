The Domain Name System (DNS) is a {{critical}} component of the Internet infrastructure as it maps human-readable hostnames into <b>the</b> IP <b>addresses</b> <b>the</b> <b>network</b> uses <b>to</b> route traffic. Yet, the DNS behavior of individual clients is not well understood. In this paper, we present a characterization of DNS clients with an eye towards developing an analytical model of client interaction with the larger DNS ecosystem. While this is initial work and we do not arrive at a DNS workload model, we highlight a variety of behaviors and characteristics that significantly increase our mental models of how DNS operates and move us towards an analytical model of client-side DNS operation. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of NATs map multiple private hosts to one publicly exposed IP address. In a typical configuration, a local network uses {{one of the}} designated [...] "private" [...] IP address subnets (RFC 1918).

40|$|Internetworking {{protocols}} such as IP currently do {{not allow}} "mobile hosts" to interoperate easily or conveniently with other hosts on <b>the</b> <b>network.</b> A host's IP <b>address</b> encodes <b>the</b> <b>network</b> number <b>to</b> which <b>the</b> host is connected, which prevents IP datagrams from reaching the host when it moves to a new location and connects to the Internet within a different network. This paper presents a new protocol for allowing mobile hosts to transparently interoperate in the Internet using IP. The protocol is designed {{to make use of}} existing facilities of the IP protocol architecture where possible, in order to minimize any changes necessary to existing protocol software. The protocol takes advantage of the standard IP loose source routing option for routing datagrams correctly to mobile hosts, while allowing the hosts to retain their normal "home" IP address even when connected <b>to</b> a foreign <b>network.</b> <b>The</b> protocol is simple and scales well to large numbers of mobile hosts.

40|$|Abstract: Recently, losses {{reduction}} {{gained a}} great deal of attention in distribution system due to low-voltage level and the high-current passing through the lines, pushing the distribution utilities to improve their profit margins on one hand by reducing the unnecessary operational cost, and improving their delivered power quality on the other hand by maintaining the system reliability, and the continuity of supply for varying load demand. Load balancing, voltage regulation, network reconfiguration and others are different techniques used to reduce the losses. This study <b>addresses</b> <b>the</b> distribution <b>network</b> reconfiguration <b>to</b> minimise <b>the</b> <b>network</b> losses. A new modified form of particle swarm optimisation (PSO) is used to identify the optimal configuration of distribution <b>network</b> effectively. <b>The</b> difference between the modified PSO (MPSO) algorithms and the typical one is the filtered random selective search space for initial position, which is proposed to accelerate the algorithm for reaching the optimum solution. The suggested MPSO is tested via 33 and 69 IEEE networks. A benchmark comparison has been conducted to prove the effectiveness of MPSO compared with previous optimisation techniques...|$|R
30|$|Network {{reconfiguration}} is {{a complex}} combinational optimization problem [3], and many approaches have been proposed for power loss minimization in the literature. Treating DGs as negative loads, Cui et al. [4] applied a genetic algorithm (GA) <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>network</b> reconfiguration problem <b>to</b> achieve power loss minimization. The results showed that network reconfiguration with DGs reduces active power loss and improves the voltage profile over feeders. Dai et al. [5] reconfigured <b>the</b> distribution <b>network</b> based on a refined branch-exchange technique. This method can decrease the number of necessary switch combinations and quickly determine <b>the</b> distribution <b>network</b> topological structure <b>to</b> reduce active power loss. With regard to topology adjustment, this algorithm switches off the branch that has a current closest to the ideal transfer current and obtains a near-optimal solution relatively quickly. Rao et al. [6] proposed a new approach for reconfiguring and installing DGs simultaneously in <b>the</b> distribution <b>network.</b> A metaheuristic harmony search algorithm (HSA) was used to reconfigure and identify the optimal placement of DGs. The results showed that <b>the</b> simultaneous <b>network</b> reconfiguration and DG installation method is more effective in reducing power loss and improving the voltage profile. Numerous studies have considered network reconfiguration for service restoration. Li et al. [7] proposed a service restoration model for reconfiguration in which the minimization of both active power loss and the possible number of switch operations are considered simultaneously, and a new approach based on the tabu search was used to solve this model. Gholami et al. [8] proposed two heuristic methods to solve the service restoration problem considering load shedding based on two important indices and a graph-based method. Li et al. [9] formulated a heuristic algorithm for service restoration of <b>the</b> distribution <b>network</b> with DG <b>to</b> determine the closing order of tie switches by calculating the optimal cut point. The capacity of the standby power source can be well utilized, {{and the effects of}} uncertainty on loads and DG outputs on service restoration can be included.|$|R
40|$|The {{background}} for this masters thesis {{is the threat}} of session hijacking in public wireless networks. A public wireless network {{in this context is}} a network such as Wireless Trondheim where users with WLAN enabled devices can connect for a small fee for a given period of time. These kind of networks relies on having a high degree of user friendliness to reach users with average knowledge in computers and wireless networks. There is always a struggle between user friendliness and security and the downside to the user friendliness in these kind of networks is poor security. Many of these <b>networks</b> only use <b>the</b> unique identifier (MAC <b>address)</b> of <b>the</b> <b>network</b> device <b>to</b> identify users and grant them access. A person with some technical knowledge about wireless networks and less then honest intentions may exploit this weak security barrier and impersonate the legitimate user by duplicating <b>the</b> MAC <b>address.</b> <b>The</b> practical part of this master thesis starts with the setup of a test bench with three computers, an attacker, a legitimate client and a passive monitor. A MAC spoofing attack was performed on <b>the</b> production <b>network</b> <b>to</b> prove that this kind of attack is easy to perform. The attack was first done with Backtrack which is a specialized penetration testing OS and the same type of attack was done in Windows to also prove that it does not require specialized tools. The attacker was able {{to gain access to the}} Internet without going through the web page for authentication. The thesis also proposes some countermeasures against this kind of attack. They are session ID, MAC sequence number tracking and monitoring physical properties such as received signal strength and RTS-CTS handshake round trip times. The thesis presents some thoughts on how they can be implemented in <b>the</b> wireless Trondheim <b>network</b> and what <b>the</b> major difficulties of each of them might be. The thesis also makes an evaluation of how well each of them fit with Wireless Trondheims requirements for countermeasures against the attacks done in this thesis. </p...|$|R

With an overall view of <b>the</b> <b>network,</b> <b>the</b> SDN controller has visibility over the offloaded data and can deliver subscribed content from vendors even after offloading, {{which is important}} for the operators [4]. Moreover, SDN provides an open and easily reconfigurable interface, which will enable the operators to efficiently modify and update/upgrade network policies. Our contributions also include quantifying the delay incurred due to the SDN-based data processing and forwarding and analyzing the performance improvements of the proposed algorithms under realistic network model. Results show that SDN-based data offloading algorithm decreases threshold miss probability and saves significant amount of cellular resources simultaeously. It is also shown that SDN-based load balancing achieves better resource allocation with higher network throughput and smaller number of handovers, as compared to the baseline algorithms.|$|R
