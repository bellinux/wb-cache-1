5|$|The Scalloway Islands {{are a small}} {{archipelago}} at {{the entrance}} to Weisdale Voe in the South West. The North Isles is the name given to the group including Yell, Unst and Fetlar. There are also numerous islands in Yell Sound between the Mainland <b>and</b> <b>Yell</b> and in St. Magnus Bay to the west, especially near the strait of Swarbacks Minn, but the number and diverse locations of the Shetland islands makes further classification difficult.|$|E

In 1991, North Yell was merged with Mid <b>and</b> South <b>Yell</b> to the new civil parish of Yell, leaving Fetlar a parish of its own.

5|$|A {{crowd of}} several {{thousand}} gathered outside the courthouse while Lockett's trial was underway. A cameraman asked {{a large group of}} those gathered to shake their fists <b>and</b> <b>yell</b> so he could get a picture. The rest of the crowd mistakenly believed they were storming the courthouse and rushed forward. In the ensuing skirmish, one policeman was injured so badly that his arm later had to be amputated. The National Guard opened fire, killing six people and wounding approximately fifty. Some members of the mob looted nearby stores in search of weapons to retaliate, but reinforcements arrived from a nearby army post by mid-afternoon. Martial law was declared, and no further violence was perpetrated. A month later, Lockett was executed at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville.|$|E

5|$|The film had regular showings in many theaters worldwide, {{with many}} as a monthly event.

Wiseau has claimed that it was his intent for audiences to find humor in the film, although viewers and some of the cast members generally have viewed it as a poorly-made drama.|$|E

25|$|Then {{came the}} rematch with Bowe on November 6, 1993. In what is {{considered}} by many sporting historians {{as one of the most}} bizarre moments in boxing's history, during round seven the crowd got off their feet and many people started to run for cover <b>and</b> <b>yell.</b> Holyfield took his eyes off Bowe for one moment and then told Bowe to look up to the skies. What they saw was a man in a parachute flying dangerously close to them. The man almost entered the ring, but his parachute had gotten entangled in the lights and he landed on the ropes and apron of the ring, and he was then pulled into the crowd, where he was beaten by members of Bowe's entourage. Bowe's pregnant wife, Judy, fainted and had to be taken to the hospital from the arena. Twenty minutes later, calm was restored and Holyfield went on to recover his world heavyweight titles with a close 12 round majority decision. The man who parachuted down to the middle of the ring became known as The Fan Man and the fight itself became known as the Fan Man Fight. His victory over Bowe that year helped Holyfield being named as ABC's Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year for 1993.|$|E

In her own way, Cher is an outlier, perhaps the last unreconstructed high-profile Twitter user to stand at her digital pulpit <b>and</b> <b>yell</b> (somewhat) incomprehensibly, and be rewarded for it. Online, authenticity and originality are often carefully curated myths. Cher thrives on a version of nakedness and honesty that is rarely celebrated in the public eye." [...] Monica Heisey of The Guardian called Cher's Twitter profile [...] "a jewel in the bizarro crown of the internet", and stated, [...] "While many celebrities use Twitter for carefully crafted self-promotion, Cher just lets it all hang out." ...|$|E
500|$|Some Easter eggs {{originated}} from in-jokes {{between members of}} the development team.

[...] This egg was also the key to unlocking the hidden character Smoke when it happened in the Portal stage. In Mortal Kombat 4, Forden would say [...] "Toasty! 3D!" [...] after Scorpion did his burn Fatality, a reference to the fact that it is the first 3D game of the series. [...] "Toasty!" [...] is also found in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, appearing randomly after the character pulls off a chain of hits, though the picture of Forden was removed for that title, but brought back for the 2011 Mortal Kombat game.|$|E

500|$|For the film's director, King {{wanted someone}} [...] "who would steer {{us away from}} the {{traditional}} BBC-type costume drama," [...] and [...] "make a period film for an MTV audience". By chance, someone recommended King watch the 2005 film C.R.A.Z.Y. by French-Canadian filmmaker Jean-Marc Vallée, and became immediately interested in hiring him. King offered the job to Vallée on their very first meeting. Though at first expressing disinterest, Vallée agreed to direct after reading the script. He commented, [...] "When I read the script, I saw it's a family drama, a romance, a political plot at the same time." [...] Vallee considered Victoria to be a rebel because [...] "she has this attitude, which is you make noise, you want to yell <b>and</b> <b>yell</b> loudly to your parents and all the people, to authority...

500|$|Wilson dislikes {{saying his}} character's catchphrase ("I don't believe it!") and only {{performs}} {{the line for}} charity events for a small fee. This became a joke in the actor's guest appearance as himself in the Father Ted episode [...] "The Mainland", where Ted annoys him by constantly repeating his catchphrase. The situation was conceived when Father Ted writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews sat behind Wilson at a performance of Le Cirque du Soleil at the Royal Albert Hall. They considered how [...] "tasteless and wrong" [...] {{it would be to}} lean forward to him every time that an acrobat did a stunt <b>and</b> <b>yell</b> the catchphrase, and then they realised that that's exactly what their fictional priests would do. This was also played upon when Wilson made a guest appearance on the comedy TV quiz show Shooting Stars, in which Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer purposefully misquoted his catchphrase by referring to him as [...] "Richard 'I don't believe you' Wilson".|$|E
500|$|When {{comparing}} work on Batman Forever, Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, explained, [...] "It {{just felt}} like everything got a little soft the second time.

[...] He also complained of the Robin costume, saying it was more involved and uncomfortable {{than the one he}} wore in Batman Forever, with a glued-on mask which caused sweat to pool on his face. According to John Glover, who played Dr. Jason Woodrue, [...] "Joel [...] would sit on a crane with a megaphone <b>and</b> <b>yell</b> before each take, 'Remember, everyone, this is a cartoon'. It was hard to act because that kind of {{set the tone for the}} film." [...] Production designer Barbara Ling admitted her influences for the Gotham City design came from [...] "neon-ridden Tokyo and the Machine Age. Gotham is like a World's Fair on ecstasy." [...] Rhythm and Hues and Pacific Data Images created the visual effects sequences, with John Dykstra and Andrew Adamson credited as the visual effects supervisors.|$|E

500|$|After each yell, {{students}} make a noise and a hand motion {{that is known}} as a wildcat. [...] Each class has a separate wildcat, and students caught [...] "pulling out," [...] or using the wildcat of a higher class, are often forced to do pushups as punishment. [...] Freshmen raise their hands above their heads <b>and</b> <b>yell</b> [...] "AAAA". [...] Sophomores, symbolically pushing back on the seniors, chant [...] "A!" [...] five times, waving their hands up and {{down in front of the}} torso with their index fingers extended and thumbs perpendicular. [...] Juniors yell [...] "A! A! A! Whoop!" [...] wrapping their left hand over their right fist, with both index fingers extended and pointing towards the ground, [...] "shooting the ground" [...] once for each [...] "A" [...] and holding the position on the [...] "whoop!"

500|$|In a February 11, 2011 Entertainment Weekly article, veteran script {{supervisor}} Sandy Schklair {{announced that}} he desired credit for directing The Room. Schklair told EW shortly after being hired on as script supervisor, Wiseau became too engrossed with his acting duties to direct the film properly; according to Schklair, Wiseau then asked him to [...] "tell the actors what to do, <b>and</b> <b>yell</b> 'Action' and 'Cut' and tell the cameraman what shots to get." [...] The script supervisor {{also said that he}} had a conversation with Wiseau in which he refused to give up the title of [...] "director", but asked Schklair to [...] "direct [...] movie." [...] The story is corroborated by {{at least one of the}} film's actors, who requested anonymity for the story. Wiseau has dismissed Schklair's comments. Greg Sestero's memoir The Disaster Artist about the making of The Room partially corroborates Schklair's version of events, describing him taking charge of numerous sequences in which Wiseau found himself unable to remember lines properly or adequately interact with the rest of the cast, but jokes that claiming directorial credit was like [...] "claiming to have been the Hindenburg's principal aeronautics engineer". Wiseau said of Schklair's assertion, [...] "Well, this is so laughable that… you know what? I don’t know, probably only in America it can happen, this kind of stuff." ...|$|E
500|$|Wildflower is a plunderphonics album; every {{track on}} the record is sample-based, similar to Since I Left You. The album has also been {{described}} as featuring electronic music, neo-psychedelia, disco, and hip hop throughout. When asked if Wildflower has more than the estimated 3,500 samples on the former record, Chater stated [...] "I’ve got no idea...there’s probably more. It’s so fragmented. Every little footstep and voice <b>and</b> <b>yell</b> and clatter and cowhorn and dog barking, it’s just ridiculous." [...] The group had been clearing samples starting in 2011-12, but would occasionally need to re-negotiate when owners of the source material discovered who the Avalanches were and would request more money. The sample clearance was done by Pat Shannahan in Los Angeles, who also cleared the samples for Since I Left You. The track [...] "Subways" [...] features vocals sampled from a 1980 track {{of the same name}} sung by then 12-year-old post punk artist Chandra off her EP Transportation. Chandra had not heard of the Avalanches until they approached her in early 2014 for permission to sample the track, but has since become a fan of their work. The most difficult sample to clear was of a choir from Kew High School in Melbourne singing [...] "Come Together" [...] by The Beatles on the track [...] "The Noisy Eater". Initially their request was refused, but Chater and Di Blasi made contact with Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono directly through [...] "friends of friends". They sent them the track along with a letter written by Tony explaining their process and in return were granted approval. The song would have not been added to Wildflower if the sample could not be cleared.|$|E
