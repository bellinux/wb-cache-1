5|$|The 2013 {{tax rate}} {{was set at}} $2.486 per $100 of <b>assessed</b> <b>value</b> (an overall {{increase}} of 3.7% from 2012), which is composed of school taxes of $1.365 (up almost 3.3%), municipal taxes of $0.871 (an increase of 5.8%), a library tax of $.031 (down 3.1%) and county taxes of $0.206 (down 0.5%), plus a municipal open space tax of $0.010 and a county open space tax of $0.003 (both unchanged). The owner of a median-valued home in Teaneck, assessed at $465,300, paid 2011 property taxes of $11,190, which would include $6,244 in school taxes, $3,992 in municipal taxes and $949 to the county (including open space levies).|$|E

40|$|Actual {{property}} values are overwhelmingly {{employed as a}} dependent variable in hedonic pricing models. Yet, <b>assessed</b> property <b>values</b> are generally more readily available than actual sales values and have, in some studies, been used in lieu of market prices. In this study, we compare estimates of different non-market amenity values based on actual transactions and <b>assessed</b> <b>values.</b> We estimate a Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) model with two hedonic price equations, one with actual market values {{as the dependent variable}} and the other with <b>assessed</b> property <b>values,</b> and compare the resulting estimates of shadow prices for open space amenities. We also take into account spatial autocorrelation and combine Method of Moment estimates of the spatial parameters in both equations to create our test statistic. The results indicate that we cannot accept the hypothesis that the impacts of open space on {{property values}} are the same for actual sales and <b>assessed</b> <b>values.</b> Moreover, we do observe some differences between the distributions of <b>assessed</b> versus sales <b>values,</b> although the difference between the sizes of open space effects measured within the two equations is rather limited. Thus, while this one study is insufficient to enable one to draw definitive conclusions, there remains the possibility that policy makers cannot reliably base decisions on amenity values obtained from a hedonic model using <b>assessed</b> <b>values...</b>|$|R

25|$|Proposition 13 {{sets the}} <b>assessed</b> <b>value</b> of {{properties}} {{at the time}} of purchase (known as an acquisition value system), with a possible 2% annual assessment increase.

The Case-Shiller housing index shows prices in Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco appreciated 170% from 1987 (the start of available data) to 2012 while the 2% cap only allowed a 67% increase in taxes on homes that were not sold during this 26-year period.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature on the sale price appraisal ratio (SPAR) as an alternative house price index methodology. Housing market transaction data for 12 cities or districts in New Zealand for the period 1994 – 2004 is utilised to test the effect of measurement errors in <b>assessed</b> <b>values</b> on index accuracy and temporal aggregation on index stability. The main findings are: 1) temporal aggregation effect on the SPAR index stability is a constraint at the monthly level with respect to this New Zealand data set. 2) reporting sample size has a much larger effect on the precision of the SPAR index than the frequency of reassessments. Random measurement errors in <b>assessed</b> <b>values</b> tend to cancel out each other when the number of sales per period is large. 3) Any reassessment tends to disturb the SPAR index for the reassessment period.

25|$|The {{property}} may be reassessed {{under certain}} conditions other than a change of ownership, such as when additions or new construction occur. The <b>assessed</b> <b>value</b> is also subject to reduction if {{the market value of}} the property declines below its <b>assessed</b> <b>value,</b> for example, during a real estate slump. Reductions of property valuation were not provided for by Proposition 13 itself, but were made possible by the passage of Proposition 8 (SCA No. 67) during 1978 that amended Proposition 13. Such a real estate slump and downward reassessments occurred during 2009 when the California State Board of Equalization announced an estimated reduction of property tax base year values due to negative inflation. The property tax in California is an Ad valorem tax meaning that the tax assessed (generally) increases and decreases with the value of the property.|$|E

Operations research modelling has the potential to help in the assessment of these counterfactuals. However, is such modelling too arcane, complex, and technically burdensome for organisations that, like SAIs, operate in a time- and resource-constrained and politically charged environment? We report on three applications of modelling at the UK's SAI, the National Audit Office, in the context of studies on demand management in tax collection, end-of-life care, and health-care associated infections. In all cases, the models have featured in the audit reports and helped study teams come to a value-for-money judgment. We conclude that OR modelling is indeed a valuable addition to the value-for-money auditor's methodological tool box...|$|R
