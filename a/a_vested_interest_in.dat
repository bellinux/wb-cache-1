5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Wallace was {{drawn into the}} debate over {{mandatory}} smallpox vaccination. Wallace originally saw the issue {{as a matter of}} personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the germ theory of disease was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human immune system to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, research on this family was thus more advanced than Indo-European research.

25|$|At {{the time}} of Hammarskjöld's death, {{intelligence}} agencies of the U.S. and its allies were {{actively involved in the}} political situation in the Congo, which culminated in Belgian and United States support for the secession of Katanga and the assassination of former prime minister Patrice Lumumba. Belgium and the United Kingdom had <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> maintaining their control over much of the country's copper industry during the Congolese transition from colonialism to independence. Concerns about the nationalisation of the copper industry could have provided a financial incentive to remove either Lumumba or Hammarskjöld.|$|E
25|$|A {{public debate}} about {{the cause of the}} {{accident}} arose after the report, in part because of sightings of fighter jets. Such reports had been appearing in the media since shortly after the accident. Fremover reported in January 1987 that radar had observed an unidentified aircraft which was {{on a collision course with}} the Twin Otter. The issue escalated with the captain's brother, Widerøe's chief pilot John Hovring, stating that the crash must have occurred as a result of a collision with a fighter or missile. He further stated that General Mohr as an air force officer had <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> covering up the real cause.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Lih and Andrew Brown both {{maintain}} editing Wikipedia with smart phones {{is difficult}} and this discourages new potential contributors. Several years running the number of Wikipedia editors has been falling and Tom Simonite of MIT Technology Review claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this.

Lih fears for Wikipedia's long term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it.|$|E
30|$|Another type of {{evidence}} that does not address program effects comes from surveys of employers or program administrators. Pavetti et al. (2011) report that administrators of subsidized employment programs surveyed by telephone claimed that the subsidies helped some small businesses expand, although it would be preferable to obtain this (still subjective) information from employers. Roder and Elliott (2013) conducted a telephone survey of employers {{who took part in}} job subsidy programs in three states and report that 63  % said they created new positions in order to hire the subsidized workers. Of course, employers may have <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> giving <b>a</b> positive assessment of a program that is to their financial advantage.|$|R

Furthermore, Okubo’s record of the internment of 120, 000 Japanese Americans during World War II can be usefully read and taught as an autoethnography that constructs a counterhistory of World War II. The juxtaposition of Okubo’s autobiographical record of her internment experience {{with a variety of}} “official” images can help students learn about the construction of knowledge. Such classroom work can help students “decolonize knowledge,” to borrow a phrase from Mary Louise Pratt, by demonstrating how knowledge is not neutral but is instead constructed by constituencies with <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> how events are depicted...|$|R

25|$|Salleh was {{represented}} by Anthony Lester, QC, who objected to the tribunal's composition. It was argued Abdul Hamid had <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the case's outcome, since if Salleh was impeached, he would remain Lord President. It was also claimed that the tribunal was improperly constituted because two of the judges were relatively junior, and that the two foreign judges were from countries not noted for judicial independence. Salleh demanded to be tried by peers of equal standing – retired Lord presidents, if need be. He also demanded that the tribunal make its hearings public. All of these claims were rejected by the tribunal, and Salleh withdrew from the proceedings.|$|E
25|$|When Ronald Reagan {{was elected}} in 1982, he {{significantly}} reduced the size and cost of many portions of government, thereby greatly limiting the Civil Service Reform Act. Satisfying {{the need for new}} legislation, the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) was enacted on November 8, 1984. Most notably, the PMRS provided a greater level of evaluation accuracy and imposed minimum and maximum levels of pay increase to limit disparity among merit pay employees. PMRS also created Performance Standard Review Boards for each department and required that {{at least half of the}} board be members who were under the merit pay system. This requirement ensured that at least some board members had <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> dealing with potential problems and concerns.|$|E
50|$|After a {{visit to}} the local survey company, Africa Engineers, Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, we believe that we have found the map of the survey ordered (if not done by) (Figure 2) John Armstrong; who, had <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> {{personal}} <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the property at Aughwick as he owned the deed to one of the three tracts (also redrawn and reprinted in Africa 1883, 342a).|$|R

50|$|In 1844 Wood {{became a}} partner in the company that owned Hetton Colliery, and moved to Hetton Hall as {{colliery}} manager. He also had <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of other local collieries and businesses. Following the introduction of the Mines Inspection Act of 1850 he was appointed President of the newly formed North of England Institute of Mining Engineers. He campaigned for a College of Science in Newcastle which eventually came to fruition after his death, and was the forerunner to Newcastle University. In 1857, he published an other work on mining safety, On the conveyance of coals underground in pits, which was read at monthly meetings of the Institute. In 1858 he was elected member of the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers, and soon became its first President, delivering the Inaugural Address, and was thus re-elected each year afterwards until his death in 1865. In 1864 Wood was made a Fellow of the Royal Society.|$|R
25|$|The Chinese {{originally}} built a road across northern Phongsali Province in 1962 and 1963 as {{a foreign}} aid project. They then began an entirely new road construction project in early 1966, extending south from Yunnan Province past Luang Namtha, down the Pakbeng Valley. As Route 46, the new road gathered ever more attention the further south it progressed. The Royal Thai Government worried it might be extended across trackless northwestern Laos to the Thai border. The presence of 25,000 Chinese troops and 400 antiaircraft guns along the new road raised anxiety {{not only in the}} Thai and Lao governments, but also in Washington. The American government had <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> Thailand; the Kingdom was a major American supporter in the ongoing Vietnam War.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, the Public Service Administration of Chicago {{recommended}} {{restructuring the}} Atlanta City Council. Based upon that recommendation, Hamilton {{introduced a bill}} to establish Atlanta Charter Commission. Her goal was to bring city representation into compliance with the 1965 Voting Rights Act and apportion the council seats relative to {{the demographics of the}} city. This would give blacks fair representation in the city government. Commission chair Emmet J. Bondurant and vice-chair Hamilton began work July 1, 1971. Governor Jimmy Carter signed the new charter into law on March 16, 1973. The new charter separated the city's legislative and executive branches, but shrunk the size of the City Council. Protests were raised by those with <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the number of city council seats, and a compromise was worked out.|$|E
25|$|Fortna {{argues that}} peacekeepers have a {{positive}} impact on the peace process, despite often being sent to places where peace is most difficult to achieve. Peacekeeping is often looked at by detractors as ineffective, or unnecessary. Peace prevails when belligerents already have <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> sustaining peace and therefore it could be argued that Peacekeepers play only a minor role in creating a strong foundation for enduring peace. Yet these causal reasons illustrate the important roles that Peacekeepers play in ensuring that peace lasts, especially when contrasted against situations in which belligerents are left to their own devices. These causal reasons thus illustrate the need for Peacekeeping and lay a foundation for the manner in which Peacekeeping operations can have a substantive impact on the post-conflict environment.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{quantitative}} theory of entrepreneurship, income inequality, and financial frictions disciplined with household data from Brazil. The theory extends Lucas (1978) by modeling heterogeneity in two skills: -working and managerial skills. Consistently with the evidence, the theory implies three occupational categories: workers, employers, and self-employed entrepreneurs. We {{find that the}} removal of financial frictions decreases self-employment rates from 24 % to 11 % (with small effects {{on the number of}} employers), increases aggregate output by 48 %, and has non- trivial effects on the distribution of income. We also find that while most households benefit from a reform that eliminates enforcement problems, the majority of employers (about two thirds) lose from the reform. By depressing the demand for labor, limited enforcement depresses the equilibrium wage rate, increasing the profits of employers. Our theory thus suggests that employers in Brazil may have <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> maintaining <b>a</b> status quo with low enforcement.

40|$|Whereas tariffs {{were once}} the main barrier to {{international}} trade, cross-national differences in regulation now constitute {{the most significant}} impediment to trade and are therefore the centrepiece issues in contemporary trade negotiations. That change has profound implications for the global economy and for international political economy scholarship. This article explains how that change occurred in order to explore how the incorporation of regulation affects trade and illuminate the politics that surround the negotiation over these regulatory trade barriers. As tariffs and other non-regulatory measures were reduced, {{the extent to which}} cross-national differences in regulation impeded trade became more apparent, especially to multinational firms which pushed for attenuations of these regulatory trade barriers. Once regulations became the subject of trade negotiations in the 1980 s, civil society groups with <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> those regulations became involved in trade politics to a greater degree than ever before. These developments have shaped the major trade negotiations underway today and are likely to remain at the centre of trade politics for the foreseeable future...|$|R
25|$|The Protestant Reformation {{had begun}} in Germany in 1517. Charles, through his {{position}} as Holy Roman Emperor, his important holdings along Germany's frontiers, and his close relationship with his Habsburg relatives in Austria, had <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> maintaining {{the stability of the}} Holy Roman Empire. The German Peasants' War broke out in Germany in 1524 and ravaged the country until it was brutally put down in 1526; Charles, even as far away from Germany as he was, was committed to keeping order. After the Peasants' War the Protestants organized themselves into a defensive league to protect themselves from Emperor Charles. Under the protection of the Schmalkaldic League, the Protestant states committed a number of outrages {{in the eyes of the}} Catholic Church— the confiscation of some ecclesiastical territories, among other things— and defied the authority of the Emperor.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} years of Philip's reign, Spain entered the initial part of the {{conflict}} that would become known as the Thirty Years' War (1618–48). The result was a decisive Spanish victory in the Holy Roman Empire that would lead to a recommencement of the war with the Dutch shortly after Philip's death. Europe was anticipating a fresh election for the position of Emperor upon the likely death of Matthias, who was heirless. Spain and Austria's common Habsburg ancestry influenced Spain's involvement in the convoluted politics of the Empire: on the one hand, Philip had <b>a</b> <b>vested</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the success of his cousin Ferdinand of Bohemia, who intended to follow Matthias to the throne; on the other, Philip had hopes of appointing one of his own family, such as Prince Philip, to the Imperial throne and worried that a failed bid by Ferdinand might reduce collective Habsburg prestige.|$|E
