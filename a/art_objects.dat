5|$|She began {{purchasing}} <b>art</b> <b>objects</b> {{with the}} intention of sending them to America, so that people that were not afforded the luxury of traveling to Europe could view good works of art. Norcross collected furniture, textiles, porcelains, and other objects during visits to quiet French villages.|$|E
5000|$|Conceptual Art focused {{attention}} on the idea behind the <b>art</b> <b>object</b> and questioned the traditional role of that object as the conveyor of meaning. Subsequently, those theories cast doubt upon the necessity of materiality itself as conceptual artists [...] "de-materialized" [...] the <b>art</b> <b>object</b> and began to produce time-based and ephemeral artworks. Although total dematerialization of the <b>art</b> <b>object</b> never occurred, the <b>art</b> <b>object</b> became flexible - malleable - and that malleability, coupled with semiotics and computer processing, {{has resulted in the}} post-conceptual <b>art</b> <b>object.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Museum's {{permanent}} collection includes approximately 3,000 paintings, drawings, sculptures, works on paper, and decorative <b>arts</b> <b>objects.</b> Particular strengths include American decorative <b>arts</b> <b>objects,</b> early 20th century European art, California Modernism, and contemporary art of California.|$|R

In [...] "Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object" [...] Lucy Lippard {{characterizes the}} period of 1966 to 1972 as {{one in which the}} <b>art</b> <b>object</b> was dematerialised through the new artistic practices of conceptual art.|$|R
5|$|As {{the museum}} {{moved to the}} National Mall in the mid 1980s, its {{permanent}} collection consisted of more than 6,000 <b>art</b> <b>objects</b> (e.g., sculpture, artifacts, textiles) and the large Elisofon photography collection. This original collection focused on Sub-Saharan Africa, with better representation of the Guinea coast and Western Sudan than the Central African region. The collection is idiosyncratic, reflecting the relative lack of colonial era African art acquisitions in American donor collections. Some early highlights of the museum's collection include an Edo–Portuguese ivory spoon and an Akan gold pendant bequeathed by the Robert Woods Bliss estate. The museum's first acquisitions budget came with joining the Smithsonian.|$|E
5|$|Woolly mammoth ivory {{was used}} to create <b>art</b> <b>objects.</b> Several Venus figurines, {{including}} the Venus of Brassempouy and the Venus of Lespugue, were made from this material. Weapons made from ivory, such as daggers, spears, and a boomerang, are also known. To be able to process the ivory, the large tusks had to be chopped, chiselled and split into smaller, more manageable pieces. Some ivory artefacts show that tusks had been straightened, and it is unknown how this was achieved.|$|E
5|$|FIU {{has three}} museums, the Frost Art Museum, the Wolfsonian-FIU Museum and the Jewish Museum of Florida. The Frost Art Museum {{is located on}} Modesto A. Maidique campus and was opened in 1977 as The Art Museum at Florida International University. The Frost Art Museum's Permanent Collection {{consists}} of {{a broad array of}} <b>art</b> <b>objects</b> from ancient cultural artifacts to contemporary works of art. The Wolfsonian-FIU Museum is located in Miami Beach and promotes the collection, preservation and understanding of decorative art and design from the period from 1885 to 1945. FIU also has a large sculpture collection, named the Sculpture Park at FIU, with sculptures from such prominent artists as Anthony Caro, Jacques Lipchitz, Daniel Joseph Martinez, and Tony Rosenthal. Many different art structures, statues, paintings and mosaics can be seen throughout campus in gardens, buildings, walkways, and on walls.|$|E
50|$|People may {{be mistaken}} by the <b>art</b> <b>object</b> analogy. For instance, a sandhill crane {{is not an}} art object; an <b>art</b> <b>object</b> is not a sandhill crane. In fact, an <b>art</b> <b>object</b> should be called an artifact. The crane is {{wildlife}} on its own and is not an <b>art</b> <b>object.</b> This {{can be related to}} Satio's definition of the cognitive view. In elaboration, the crane lives through various ecosystems such as Yellowstone. Nature is a living system which includes animals, plants, and Eco-systems. In contrast, an <b>art</b> <b>object</b> has no regeneration, evolutionary history, or metabolism. An individual may be in the forest and perceive it as beautiful because of the plethora of colors such as red, green, and yellow. This {{is a result of the}} chemicals interacting with chlorophyll. An individual's aesthetic experience may increase; however, none of the things mentioned have anything to do with what is really going on in the forest. The chlorophyll is capturing solar energy and the residual chemicals protect the trees from insect grazing.|$|R

5|$|Many <b>art</b> <b>objects</b> were {{produced}} in Northern China {{during the time}} of the Northern Celestial Masters. These objects were closely modeled on Buddhist designs. The image of the god (usually Laozi), would be carved on the front side of a stone stele, with inscriptions on the back or side of the carving. The inscriptions were usually prayers to the dead, a wish for the happiness of family members or wishes for political peace. The iconography and contents of the inscriptions show that a close relationship between Daoism and Buddhism existed in the Northern Wei state. This relationship is especially evident in some four-sided stelae that had carvings of both Laozi on two sides and the Buddha on the other two.|$|E
5|$|Not long afterwards, Horch {{closed the}} Roerich Museum, which {{subsequently}} {{moved to a}} new location at 319 West 107th Street in 1949. In the Roerich Museum's former space, Horch established the Riverside Museum. He became president of the new museum and appointed Vernon C. Porter as its director. Open to the public free of charge, the new museum was devoted mainly to exhibitions of contemporary art by American artists. At its opening in on June 4, 1938, the museum showed modern American paintings and work by native Americans as well as Tibetan <b>art</b> <b>objects</b> that Roerich had given to Horch. The American artists included Stuart Davis, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Jack Levine, Marsden Hartley, George Luks, John Sloan, Philip Evergood, Reginald Marsh, Charles Burchfield, and Rockwell Kent.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum has}} a {{collection}} of 13,000 artifacts, books, photographs, <b>art</b> <b>objects,</b> and memorabilia. The DuSable collection has come largely from private gifts. It has United States slavery-era relics, nineteenth- and twentieth-century artifacts, and archival materials, including the diaries of sea explorer Captain Harry Dean. The DuSable collection includes works from scholar W. E. B. Du Bois, sociologist St. Clair Drake, and poet Langston Hughes. The African American art collection contains selections from the South Side Community Art Center students Charles White, Archibald Motley, Jr., Gus Nall, Charles Sebree, and Marion Perkins, as well as numerous New Deal Works Progress Administration period and 1960s Black Arts Movement works. The museum also owns prints and drawings by Henry O. Tanner, Richmond Barthé, and Romare Bearden, and has an extensive collection of books and records pertaining to African and African American history and culture.|$|E

5|$|The {{museum was}} founded in 1964 by a Foreign Service officer and layman who bought African <b>art</b> <b>objects</b> in Germany and {{multiple}} houses in the Capitol Hill neighborhood in which to display them. The collection focused on traditional African art and an educational mission to teach black cultural heritage. To ensure the museum's longevity, the founder lobbied the national legislature to adopt the museum under the Smithsonian's auspices. It joined the Smithsonian in 1979 and became the National Museum of African Art two years later. A new, mostly underground museum building was completed in 1987, just off the National Mall and adjacent to other Smithsonian museums. It is among the Smithsonian's smallest museums.|$|E

40|$|Current {{discourse}} about internet based art practices brings renewed {{interest to the}} materiality of the <b>art</b> <b>object</b> and the exhibition event. Digital and internet artists reflecting on the institutionalisation of the internet find that the {{turn away from the}} world of the institutionalised gallery has become untenable, and now create artwork that functions in both realms: the gallery and online. My research acknowledges this dual approach and proposes that accordingly areas of interest, such as negation and the material condition of the <b>art</b> <b>object</b> within conceptual <b>art,</b> institutional critique, and internet art should be reconsidered. By means of a practice-led artistic research methodology and based on the above context, the artist-researcher initiated a research process focused on how the distribution of art can enable us to rethink the traditional status of the <b>art</b> <b>object.</b> Integrating theory and practice led to an approach to art practice where distribution is integral to the doing and making of art. In my proposal, dispersal – or spreading the <b>art</b> <b>object</b> over multiple platforms, some of which lies beyond the exhibition event – is seen as an act of self-determination by the artist and a means to create objects with an ambiguous ontology or material condition. This proposal is developed and tested in several situations inside and outside the gallery, online, and as tools applied to text. From my research emerged a new practice I call a dispersal practice, and the dispersed object becomes a project that consists of multiple entities that are located on, or circulate through, different platforms. Some entities might appear in different forms at different times. My research finds that the functioning of the dispersed object within the artworld raises permanent questions about the status of the <b>art</b> <b>object</b> in terms of its materiality and status as art. My research finds also that the dispersed <b>art</b> <b>object</b> needs to be seen as both process and object. The dispersed object can be authorised by the artist to have the following characteristics: distributed, unlocated, circulating and ambiguous, a hybrid object structured through modularity. It becomes exposed and performed through a succession of events in different configurations. These are the temporary conditions of the dispersed <b>art</b> <b>object.</b> The research concludes with a project in collaboration with the John Hansard Gallery that demonstrates the dispersed <b>object.</b> Keywords: <b>art</b> <b>object,</b> dispersion, dispersal practice, distribution, institutionalisation, status of the <b>art</b> <b>object,</b> conceptual <b>art,</b> institutional critique, digital, internet, process, materiality, hybrid, ambiguous object, digital object, symbiosis, archive, aggregation...|$|R
