40|$|In recent years, several {{paradigms}} {{have emerged}} for interactive storytelling. In character-based storytelling, plot generation {{is based on}} the behaviour of <b>autonomous</b> <b>characters.</b> In this paper, we describe user interaction in a fully-implemented prototype of an interactive storytelling system. We describe the planning techniques used to control <b>autonomous</b> <b>characters,</b> which derive from HTN planning. The hierarchical task network representing a characters' potential behaviour constitute a target for user intervention, both in terms of narrative goals and in terms of physical actions carried out on stage. We introduce two different mechanisms for user interaction: direct physical interaction with virtual objects and interaction with synthetic characters through speech understanding. Physical intervention exists for the user in on-stage interaction through an invisible avatar: this enables him to remove or displace objects of narrative significance that are resources for character's actions, thus causing these actions to fail. Through linguistic intervention, the user can influence the <b>autonomous</b> <b>characters</b> in various ways, by providing them with information that will solve some of their narrative goals, instructing them to take direct action, or giving advice on the most appropriate behaviour. We illustrate these functionalities with examples of system-generated behaviour and conclude with a discussion of scalability issues...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: FearNot! {{is a novel}} {{software}} application aimed at the age-group of 8 - 12 year old students with the aim to influence their attitude towards and knowledge about bullying. It is a virtual learning environment for {{social and emotional learning}} that allows for individual interaction with synthetic <b>autonomous</b> <b>characters</b> that engage in bullying and ask the learner for help and advice in order to escape victimisation. FearNot! uses an emergent narrative approach that generates stories through the interaction of the learner with the <b>autonomous</b> <b>characters,</b> a highly innovative and believable way to create engaging stories and evoke emotional learning in the user. Whether learning in the virtual environment transfers to real-world attitudes and behaviour about bullying is currently investigated in a comprehensive evaluation study, both in the UK and in Germany...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAutonomous {{synthetic}} {{characters have}} the potential to promote the social engagement of users in virtual environments, enhancing their interaction experience. In computer games, for example, poor interaction with game characters can drastically detract from the gaming experience, making the design of <b>autonomous</b> synthetic <b>characters</b> an important issue. In particular, in Role Playing Games (RPGs), for example, users and <b>autonomous</b> <b>characters</b> often perform in a group. Usually, the role of such characters is very limited since they lack the social skills to perform coherently in group scenarios. The goal of the work presented here is to endow <b>autonomous</b> synthetic <b>characters</b> with social skills that allow them to perform in groups with human members. However, to successfully achieve this, {{it is not enough to}} assure that the characters behave in a coherent manner from an individual perspective or that they are able to perform the group task optimally. It is also necessary that the <b>autonomous</b> <b>characters</b> exhibit behaviours that are coherent with the group's composition, context and structure. For this reason, we have developed a model to support group dynamics of <b>autonomous</b> synthetic <b>characters</b> (SGD model) inspired by theories developed in human social psychological sciences. This model defines the knowledge that each individual should build about the others and the group, and how this knowledge drives their interactions. The model was used in a collaborative computer game that was tested with users. The results showed that the model had a positive effect on the users' social engagement, namely, on their trust and identification with the group...|$|R

5000|$|As {{explored}} {{more fully}} in the section on effects, concentrated poverty has increasingly been recognized as a [...] "causal factor" [...] in compounding the effects of poverty by isolating residents in these neighborhoods from networks and resources useful to realize human potential. In The Truly Disadvantaged, William Julius Wilson coined these processes as [...] "concentration effects." [...] The primary effect is what he termed social isolation, defined as the lack of contact or of sustained interaction with individuals and institutions that represent mainstream society. This isolation makes {{it much more difficult}} for those who are looking for jobs to be tied into the job network and also generates behavior not conducive to good work histories. What is key in Wilsons idea of social isolation is that he links the behavioral outcomes of the ghetto poor to the structural constraints of the job market and historical discrimination. This goes against the theory of a [...] "culture of poverty," [...] which implies that basic values and attitudes of the ghetto subculture have been internalized and places a strong emphasis on the <b>autonomous</b> <b>character</b> of the cultural traits once they come into existence.|$|E
5000|$|Fr. Joaquin G. Bernas opined that: [...] "The main {{objective}} of the MOA is to amend the Organic Act which established the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). The amendment envisions expansion of the geographical area of the ARMM and of its <b>autonomous</b> <b>character.</b> These objectives cannot be achieved by a mere memorandum of agreement. It will involve amending the Organic Act for the ARMM and the Constitution. The current Organic Act for ARMM is not any ordinary law. It {{is the product of}} a 3-step process prescribed by the Constitution: the formation of a regional consultative commission whose task was to enlighten the legislators who were to draft the law; drafting of the Organic Act itself by Congress; and the plebiscite conducted among the areas concerned. The original 1989 Organic Act was replaced by the Organic Act of 2001 which incorporated the salient features of the 1996 Peace Agreement entered into between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF). A 2002 decision of the Supreme Court would later make it clear that provisions of the Organic Act can be amended only through the legislative-cum-plebiscite process. The controversial MOA, product of innumerable GRP-MILF dialogues, did not go through a broad consultation. The lack of consultation is now being defended by government as a matter of “executive privilege.” The Organic Act is similar in nature to a Constitution. It is an embodiment of the will of the sovereign people of Mindanao. In the end, those who are pushing for the achievement of the goals of the MOA will have no choice but to feed it into the legislative process. Indeed, when the document begins to be subjected to scrutiny, there will be a lot to debate about." ...|$|E
5000|$|Many {{scholars}} {{refrain from}} presenting Carloctavistas as mere puppets {{of the regime}} and acknowledge genuine support the group enjoyed. Some of them, both in Spain and abroad, repeat—with reservations or unconditionally—the thesis of financial support lent by the regime, even as late as in the 1960s. Others perform review of different views and limit themselves to concluding that Francoism either was at least amicably tolerating the Carloctavistas or it was lending them at least non-financial forms of support. The collaborationist Octavista line is presented as genuine. Some {{see it as a}} conscious political strategy, an attempt aimed at gaining room for open activity and possibly using Francoism as a vehicle for crowning a Carlist king. Some see it as rooted in Carloctavista theoretical framework, to a large extent overlapping with the official doctrine, and wrap up by claiming that [...] "with no doubt, Octavism was either Carlism of the Francoists or Francoism of the offshoot Carlists".The thesis of fully <b>autonomous</b> <b>character</b> of Carloctavismo is advanced mostly by its activists or their descendants. They focus on pre-Francoist, Cruzadista origins of Don Carlos' claim, dwell on extended network of his supporters and vehemently deny having accepted financial support from the regime. Authors of major monographs on the movement—two out of three not Carloctavistas themselves though certainly Left-wing sympathizers neither—tend to share this perspective. Their works relate the origins of the movement to profound dynastical crisis within Carlism, later enhanced by political fragmentation and bewilderment of Traditionalism resulting from different strategies adopted towards Francoism. Within this perspective, theoretical outlook of the Octavistas is described as having had little in common with Falangist national-syndicalism and having been rather deeply anchored in Traditionalist thought. One scholar suggests Don Carlos stood a real chance of becoming a king, ruined by his wife, who tarnished his image and deprived him of future male descendency. These authors presents Carloctavista stand versus the so-called Rodeznistas, a collaborative and pro-Juanista branch of Carlism, as vehement opposition. Carloctavista support for the regime is presented as an attempt to outsmart the dictator and use the Francoist political setting for own political goals.|$|E

This added freedom allows many behaviors to be specified more naturally, more simply, more succinctly and at a much higher-level than would otherwise be possible. The cha [...] ...|$|R

To help build cognitive models, we develop the cognitive modeling language CML. Using CML, we can imbue a character with domain knowledge, elegantly specified in terms of actions, their preconditions and their effects, and then direct the character's behavior in terms of goals. Our approach allows behaviors to be specified more naturally and intuitively, more succinctly and at a much higher level of abstraction than would otherwise be possible.
