5|$|The {{court also}} found the <b>affidavit</b> of Parker to be {{insufficient}} as a factual matter {{to comply with the}} terms of the statute. However, even if the district attorney had brought the action and the <b>affidavit</b> had been sufficient, the Supreme Court still would have denied mandamus as a matter of law.|$|E
5|$|Klemana Schuetz was {{identified}} as the bomber by Franz Mayhoff, a New York anarchist and fraudster, who claimed in an <b>affidavit</b> that Schuetz had once admitted throwing the Haymarket bomb. August Wagener, Mayhoff's attorney, sent a telegram from New York to defense attorney Captain William Black {{the day before the}} executions claiming knowledge of the bomber's identity. Black tried to delay the execution with this telegram but Governor Oglesby refused. It was later learned that Schuetz was the primary witness against Mayhoff at his trial for insurance fraud, so Mayhoff's <b>affidavit</b> has never been regarded as credible by historians.|$|E
5|$|In a new <b>affidavit</b> (his second <b>affidavit</b> {{and third}} statement), Conley {{admitted}} he had lied about his Friday meeting with Frank. He {{said he had}} met Frank on the street on Saturday, and was told to follow him to the factory. Frank told him to hide in a wardrobe to avoid being seen by two women who were visiting Frank in his office. He said Frank dictated the murder notes for him to write, gave him cigarettes, then told {{him to leave the}} factory. Afterward, Conley said he went out drinking and saw a movie. He said he did not learn of the murder until he went to work on Monday.|$|E

50|$|The {{court found}} that there was little scope, if any, for {{deciding}} matters of fact {{on the basis of a}} respondent's <b>affidavits,</b> where such <b>affidavits</b> dealt with facts not put forward directly in answer to the factual grounds of relief on which the applicant relied, particularly where the <b>affidavits</b> dealt equivocally with such facts, as was the case in the instant matter.|$|R
5|$|In 1977 and 1978, {{he signed}} <b>affidavits</b> reasserting Butler's and Johnson's innocence, naming four other Nation members as {{participants}} in the murder or its planning. These <b>affidavits</b> {{did not result in}} the case being reopened.|$|R
5|$|The {{defendants}} alleged in an <b>affidavit</b> {{that only}} {{women who were}} members of the Illinois League of Women Voters and who had completed a jury training class (taught by a local prosecutor) were included in the jury pool. The defendants' jury was composed of six men and six women.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} for applying for {{an order for}} review of detention differs from that for obtaining a mandatory order, prohibiting order or quashing order because the latter orders are only available by leave of court, whereas an order for review of detention may be applied for without prior permission from the court. The {{procedure for}} doing so is set out in Order 54 of the Rules of Court. An application {{must be made to}} the High Court by way of an ex parte originating summons, supported, if possible, by an <b>affidavit</b> from the person being restrained which shows that the application is being made at his or her instance and explaining the nature of the restraint. If the person under restraint is unable to personally make an <b>affidavit,</b> someone may do so on his or her behalf, explaining the reason for the inability.|$|E
5|$|Chief Justice Yong, {{referring}} to the <b>affidavit</b> of the Minister for Culture, held that Order 123 was made after the Government had been satisfied that the teachings and beliefs contained in publications of the WTBTS were contrary to the public interest. The Minister had viewed the teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses as being prejudicial to the Government's nation-building efforts, and hence he had rightly exercised his discretion to prohibit such publications.|$|E

5|$|Wiesenthal did {{not mention}} either of these events—or Kohlrautz's part in them—when testifying to American {{investigators}} in May 1945, or in an <b>affidavit</b> he made in August 1954 about his wartime persecutions, and researcher Guy Walters questions their authenticity. Wiesenthal variously reported that Kohlrautz was killed on the Soviet Front in 1944 or in the Battle of Berlin on 19 April 1945.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{after being}} sued for libel by the Church of Scientology, Steven Fishman, {{a former member}} turned critic, offered {{a large amount of}} the group's highly {{confidential}} teachings in court. The documents, contained in {{what is known as the}} Fishman <b>Affidavit,</b> included detailed accounts of the church's space opera narratives. This material was subsequently posted on alt.religion.scientology and a website of Dutch journalist Karin Spaink. The church filed suits against those who posted the documents, claiming copyright violations. Lengthy court battles ensued, but the church was unable to prevent the materials' dissemination over the internet.|$|E
5|$|While early {{efforts to}} legalize {{same-sex}} marriage failed, the legislature approved two bills in 2008 that granted all unmarried couples certain domestic partnership rights, including {{the ability to}} make hospital and nursing home visits, end-of-life choices and other medical decisions, in addition to rights to joint property ownership. Domestic partners must be at least 18 years old and be able to provide an <b>affidavit</b> attesting to their relationship along with two documents, such as joint checking accounts, mortgages or car leases; coverage on health insurance policies or the designation as a primary beneficiary in a will. The laws went into effect on July 1, 2008.|$|E
2500|$|At trial, the {{prosecution}} placed into evidence the bags seized {{from the police}} car. It also submitted three [...] "certificates of analysis" [...] or <b>affidavits</b> showing {{the results of the}} forensic analysis performed on samples of the seized white powder. The <b>affidavits</b> reported the weight of the seized bags and claimed the substance found was cocaine. The <b>affidavits</b> were sworn before a notary public in accordance with Massachusetts law. [...] Melendez-Diaz objected to their admission asserting that the Supreme Court decision in Crawford v. Washington required the forensic analyst to testify in person. [...] The trial court overruled the objection and admitted the <b>affidavits</b> as prima facie evidence of the positive presence of narcotics.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>affidavits</b> attesting to the {{character}} of Joseph Smith were collected by Doctor Philastus Hurlbut. The <b>affidavits</b> themselves are not known to exist outside of their printing in Mormonism Unvailed [...] One purpose of the <b>affidavits</b> was to discredit the Smith family by emphasizing their treasure seeking activities as a negative reflection upon their character. In doing so, however, some of those providing these statements revealed their own involvement with treasure seeking as well [...] Martin Harris was also the subject of a number of these statements.|$|R
50|$|The {{respondents}} did {{not seek}} to rely on their foundational allegation on appeal; they contended instead that the matter could be decided on the appellants' <b>affidavits.</b> They based their arguments {{on the premise that}} it appeared from those <b>affidavits</b> that the hearing did not comply with the audi rule.|$|R
5|$|As the Director-General was {{a public}} officer {{appointed}} by statute to discharge public duties, he was subject to an order of prohibition in an appropriate case. The Court found that on the <b>affidavit</b> evidence produced by the applicants, the Director-General could not reasonably {{have come to the}} conclusion he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as to the nature of the evidence that was required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was unfair to the applicant. The Court therefore made an order of prohibition against the Director-General to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|E
5|$|Chapman {{purchased}} land in Portland from Stephen Coffin and Daniel H. Lownsdale in 1850, {{which he}} then cleared {{and built a}} home. This is now {{the site of the}} Multnomah County Courthouse. In Portland, he was a promoter of the city and helped to get Canyon Road built to ensure the city would become the commercial center of Oregon. Chapman practiced law, and in October 1851 he was held in contempt of court by Oregon Supreme Court justice Orville C. Pratt. Chapman was ordered to be sent to jail in the county seat of Hillsboro for 20 days and disbarred, but never went to jail and the order was revoked when Pratt was replaced on the court by justice Thomas Nelson. Chapman had accused Pratt of mistreating lawyers in an <b>affidavit.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chintanda's <b>affidavit</b> {{caused the}} BSAC to become {{concerned}} about Clark's continued authority in North-Eastern Rhodesia {{and to begin}} investigating him more thoroughly. The situation was complicated when, after a month's perusal, the Company's lawyers resolved that the courts in Salisbury and Bulawayo held no jurisdiction outside Southern Rhodesia and therefore could not hear any case brought against Clark. On 4 July 1899, Arthur Lawley, the Company's administrator in Matabeleland, wrote to Cape Town to report the situation to the resident High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Alfred Milner. Lawley briefly summarised the charges against Clark and requested permission to hold a court north of the Zambezi {{under the supervision of}} one of three chiefs friendly to the Company. Milner replied on 17 August that he could not legally sanction this, and that Lawley should pursue the matter further only when authority extended over Clark's area.|$|E
50|$|As to {{the issue}} whether the audi rule had been {{complied}} with, it appeared from the appellants' <b>affidavits</b> that the respondents {{had been given the}} opportunity to make representations. It was not clear from these <b>affidavits,</b> however, whether this opportunity had been expressed to be an unlimited one embracing all reasons why they should not be dismissed, or a restricted one confined only to reasons as to why they stayed away from work. This ambiguity made it unfair to the appellants to decide the case against them purely on their own <b>affidavits.</b>|$|R
50|$|It was not permissible, {{the court}} determined, to {{consider}} the appellants' <b>affidavits</b> in isolation, divorced from {{the context of the}} case they were answering. To the extent that the appellants' <b>affidavits</b> went further than may have been necessary to answer the case as presented, it could not be said the appellants would not be prejudiced if their <b>affidavits</b> were relied upon to determine the nature and ambit of the hearing that took place: To do so would be unfair to the appellants and tantamount to reversing the onus.|$|R
25|$|Other {{witnesses}} who signed <b>affidavits</b> reporting additional powered flights later in 1902 include Elizabeth Koteles (Gypsy Spring, 5 feet off ground, 150–250 feet) and John Lesko (flight in street and Gypsy Spring). Other people signed <b>affidavits</b> saying they saw short flights of varying altitude and distance in the 1901–1902 time period.|$|R
5|$|If a {{mandatory}} order, prohibiting order or quashing order is sought, the applicant must follow the procedure {{set out in}} Order 53 of the Rules of Court. In general, there are two stages. At the first stage, an applicant must obtain leave {{to apply for the}} prerogative order. This requirement prevents unmeritorious applications from being taken against decision-makers by filtering out groundless cases at an early stage to prevent wastage of judicial time, and protects public bodies from harassment, intentional or otherwise. An application for such leave must be made by ex parte originating summons and must be supported by a statement setting out the name and description of the applicant, the relief sought and the grounds on which it is sought; and by an <b>affidavit,</b> to be filed when the application is made, verifying the facts relied on. In granting leave, the judge hearing the application for leave may impose such terms as to costs and as to security as he or she thinks fit.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, a {{group of}} {{citizens}} from Newport asked Combs for help in cracking down on crime in their city. Just across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, Newport had gained {{a reputation as a}} haven for prostitution, gambling, and illegal alcohol. After receiving an <b>affidavit</b> from the citizens, Combs sent agents from the department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to the city. They cited six bars for violating laws governing liquor sales, and instructed Attorney General John B. Breckinridge to prosecute four local officials for failure to enforce the laws. When allegations of civil rights violations in a related trial surfaced, U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy sent federal Justice Department officials to Newport, prompting the resignation of the sheriff and a circuit judge. Two other local officials were barred from office for four years.|$|E
5|$|In July 2003 Rambhadracharya deposed as {{an expert}} witness for {{religious}} matters (OPW 16) in Other Original Suit Number5 of the Ram Janmabhoomi Babri Masjid dispute case in the Allahabad High Court. Some portions of his <b>affidavit</b> and cross examination are quoted in the final judgement by the High Court. In his <b>affidavit,</b> he cited the ancient Hindu scriptures including the Ramayana, Rāmatāpanīya Upaniṣad, Skanda Purana, Yajurveda, Atharvaveda, and others describing Ayodhya as a city holy to Hindus and the birthplace of Rama. He cited verses from two works composed by Tulsidas which, in his opinion, {{are relevant to the}} dispute. The first citation consisted of eight verses from a work called Dohā Śataka, which describe the destruction of a temple and construction of a mosque at the disputed site in 1528CE by Mughal ruler Babur, who had ordered General Mir Baqui to destroy the Rama temple, considered a symbol of worship by infidels. The second citation was a verse from a work called Kavitāvalī, which mentions a mosque. In his cross examination, he described in some detail the history of the Ramananda sect, its Mathas, rules regarding Mahants, formation and working of Akharas, and Tulsidas' works. Refuting the possibility of the original temple being {{to the north of the}} disputed area, as pleaded by the pro-mosque parties, he described the boundaries of the Janmabhoomi as mentioned in the Ayodhya Mahatmya section of Skanda Purana, which tallied with the present location of the disputed area, as noted by Justice Sudhir Agarwal. However, he stated that he had no knowledge of whether there was a Ram Chabootra ("Platform of Rama") outside the area that was locked from 1950 to 1985 and where the Chati Poojan Sthal was, nor whether the idols of Rama, his brother Lakshmana, and Sita were installed at Ram Chabootra outside the Janmabhoomi temple.|$|E
50|$|In {{a recent}} New York case, the Court {{rejected}} a lender's attempt to foreclose on summary judgment because the lender failed to submit proper <b>affidavits</b> and papers {{in support of}} its foreclosure action and also, the papers and <b>affidavits</b> that were submitted were not prepared in the ordinary course of business.|$|R

5|$|In early 1935, {{however, the}} company {{heard about the}} game's {{excellent}} sales during the Christmas season of 1934 in Philadelphia and at F.A.O. Schwarz in New York City. Robert Barton, President of Parker Brothers, contacted Darrow and scheduled a new meeting in New York City. On March 18, Parker Brothers bought Darrow's game, helped him take out a patent on it, and purchased his remaining inventory. By April, 1935, the company had learned that Darrow was not the sole inventor of the game, but sought out an <b>affidavit</b> by Darrow to repeat his statements to the contrary, and thus bolster their claim to the game. Parker Brothers subsequently decided to buy out Magie's 1924 patent and the copyrights of other commercial variants of the game to claim that it had legitimate undisputed rights to the game.|$|E
5|$|Marriage {{plans were}} {{confirmed}} and Poe returned to Baltimore {{to file for}} a marriage license on September 22, 1835. The couple might have been quietly married as well, though accounts are unclear. Their only public ceremony was in Richmond on May 16, 1836, when they were married by a Presbyterian minister named Rev. Amasa Converse. Poe was 27 and Virginia was 13, though her age was listed as 21. This marriage bond was filed in Richmond and included an <b>affidavit</b> from Thomas W. Cleland confirming the bride's alleged age. The ceremony {{was held in the}} evening at the home of a Mrs. James Yarrington, the owner of the boarding house in which Poe, Virginia, and Virginia's mother Maria Clemm were staying. Yarrington helped Maria Clemm bake the wedding cake and prepared a wedding meal. The couple then had a short honeymoon in Petersburg, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The Georgian hired William Manning Smith to {{represent}} Conley for $40. Smith {{was known for}} specializing in representing black clients, and had successfully defended a black man against an accusation of rape by a white woman. He had also taken an elderly black woman's civil case {{as far as the}} Georgia Supreme Court. Although Smith believed Conley had told the truth in his final <b>affidavit,</b> he became concerned that Conley was giving long jailhouse interviews with crowds of reporters. Smith was also anxious about reporters from the Hearst papers, who had taken Frank's side. He arranged for Conley to be moved to a different jail, and severed his own relationship with the Georgian.|$|E
