25|$|Buffeting is a {{high-frequency}} instability, {{caused by}} airflow separation or shock wave oscillations from one object striking another. It {{is caused by}} a sudden impulse of load increasing. It is a random forced vibration.

25|$|Bladder tanks, bag tanks or fuel cells, are {{reinforced}} rubberised bags {{installed in}} a section of <b>aircraft</b> <b>structure</b> designed to accommodate fuel. The bladder is rolled up and installed into the compartment through the fuel filler neck or access panel, and is secured by means of snap fasteners or cord and loops inside the compartment. Many high-performance light aircraft, helicopters and some smaller turboprop aircraft use bladder tanks.|$|E
25|$|Particularly troubling was the yaw {{instability}} in certain regimes of flight which produced inertia coupling. The aircraft could develop a sudden yaw and roll which would happen {{too fast for}} the pilot to correct and would quickly over-stress the <b>aircraft</b> <b>structure</b> to disintegration. It was under these conditions that North American's chief test pilot, George Welch, was killed while dive testing an early-production F-100A (s/n 52-5764) on 12 October 1954.|$|E
25|$|Airbus {{suggested}} Boeing's use of {{composite materials}} for the 787 fuselage was premature, and that the new A350 XWB was to feature large carbon fibre panels for the main fuselage skin. After facing criticism for maintenance costs, Airbus confirmed in early September 2007 the adoption of composite fuselage frames for the <b>aircraft</b> <b>structure.</b> The composite frames would feature aluminium strips to ensure the electrical continuity of the fuselage (for dissipating lightning strikes). Airbus will use a full mock up fuselage to develop the wiring, a different approach from the A380, on which the wiring was all done on computers.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{theory of}} {{economic}} life prediction and reliability assessment of <b>aircraft</b> <b>structures</b> {{has a significant}} effect on safety of <b>aircraft</b> <b>structures.</b> It is based on the two-stage theory of fatigue process and can guarantee the safety and reliability of structures.

At the same time, mathematical models of fatigue life prediction are presented by utilizing the fatigue scatter factors and full scale test results of <b>aircraft</b> <b>structures.</b> Furthermore, the economic life model is put forward. The model is of significant scientific value for products to provide longer economic life, higher reliability and lower cost.

25|$|The basic design, {{common to}} both models, {{was that of}} a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane of all-metal construction with side-by-side seating for two in a fully enclosed cabin. The main gear wheels of the undercarriage were retractable, and the tailwheel was steerable. The <b>aircraft</b> <b>structure</b> incorporated a framework built up of welded steel tube which extended lengthwise from the engine firewall {{to the rear of the}} cabin, and spanwise from one undercarriage well to the other. Around this framework was a conventional, monocoque fuselage. The MAC-125 was powered by a single 125-hp engine while the MAC-145 production model had a 145-hp engine instead and a larger tail fin.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, Hanno Fischer, Technical Director of Rhein-Flugzeugbau (RFB), {{developed}} {{an interest in}} aircraft powered by ducted fans integrated into the <b>aircraft</b> <b>structure,</b> flying two modified gliders as testbeds, a VFW-Fokker FK-3 fitted with an eight-bladed ducted fan in the rear fuselage, which flew as the Sirius I in 1969, and a Caproni Vizzola Calif A-21, which flew as the Sirius II on 16 December 1971. Based on the successful results of testing of these aircraft, RFB decided to start work on a two-seat ducted-fan military trainer, intended to offer jet-like handling at low cost, which became the RFB Fantrainer, while in 1972, RFB began studies on a two-seat light touring aircraft with side-by-side seating.|$|E

25|$|Homebuilt {{aircraft}} are generally small, one to four-seat sportsplanes which employ simple methods of construction. Fabric-covered wood or metal frames and plywood {{are common in}} the <b>aircraft</b> <b>structure,</b> but increasingly, fiberglass and other composites as well as full aluminum construction techniques are being used, techniques first pioneered by Hugo Junkers {{as far back as}} the late World War I era. Engines are most often the same as, or similar to, the engines used in certified aircraft (such as Lycoming, Continental, Rotax, and Jabiru). A minority of homebuilts use converted automobile engines, with Volkswagen air-cooled flat-4s, Subaru-based liquid-cooled engines, Mazda Wankel and Chevrolet Corvair six-cylinder engines being most common. The use of automotive engines helps to reduce costs, but many builders prefer dedicated aircraft engines, which are perceived to have better performance and reliability. Other engines that have been used include chainsaw and motorcycle engines.|$|E
25|$|Work {{on a more}} {{advanced}} armoured fighter, conceived as an armoured version of the Sopwith Snipe, began early in 1918. The forward portion of the fuselage was a 605lb (275kg) box of armour plate, forming {{an integral part of}} the <b>aircraft</b> <b>structure,</b> protecting the pilot and fuel system, with a 0.315 in (8mm) front plate, a 0.433 in (11mm) bottom plate, 0.236 in (6mm) side plates and rear armour consisting of an 11-gauge and 6-gauge plate separated by an air gap. The rear (unarmoured) section of the fuselage was a generally similar structure to the Snipe’s, but flat sided, to match the forepart. The two-bay wings and tailplane were identical in form to those of the Snipe, but were strengthened to cope with the extra weight, while the fin and rudder were identical to the Snipe. The new aircraft used the same Bentley BR2 rotary engine as the Snipe, covered by an unarmoured cowling – the foremost armour plate forming the firewall.|$|E
25|$|Originally, the B-52 was {{designed}} to penetrate Soviet airspace at high altitude around 35,000 feet (10.7km) and high speed around 450 kts to drop nuclear weapons. When the US intelligence realized that the Soviets had implemented a sophisticated, layered and interconnected air defense system with radar controlled surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), the US Air Force decided the B-52 would have to penetrate the Soviet airspace at low altitude around 500 feet (152 meters) and high speed to stay underneath the radar. However, low altitude, high speed flight operations put enormous stress on <b>aircraft</b> <b>structure,</b> especially when flying near mountains, up and down ridges and through valleys due to lee waves and the rotor. The B-52 was not designed {{for this kind of}} operation. 56-0591, a B-52D, took off from Larson AFB, Washington, on 23 June 1959 and experienced a horizontal stabilizer turbulence-induced failure at low level and crashed. The modification process of the B-52 series began in 1961.|$|E

25|$|Lightning {{protection}} for aircraft {{is provided by}} mounting devices on the <b>aircraft</b> <b>structure.</b> The protectors are provided with extensions through {{the structure of the}} aircraft's outer surface and within a static discharger. Protection systems for use in aircraft must protect critical and non-critical electronic equipment. Aircraft lightning protection provides an electrical path having a plurality of conductive segments, continuous or discontinuous, that upon exposure to a high voltage field form an ionization channel due to the system's breakdown voltage. Various lightning protection systems must reject the surge currents associated with the lightning strikes. Lightning protection means for aircraft include components which are dielectrics and metallic layers applied to the ordinarily lightning-accessible surfaces of composite structures. Various ground connection means to the layers comprises a section of wire mesh fusing the various layers to an attachment connecting the structure to an adjacent ground structure. Composite-to-metal or composite-to-composite structural joints are protected by making the interface areas conductive for transfer of lightning current.|$|E
500|$|In 1965, Historian Emeritus Paul E. Garber of the NASM interviewed Coandă, who related {{that the}} December 1910 flight was no accident, {{that he had}} seated himself in the cockpit {{intending}} to test five factors: <b>aircraft</b> <b>structure,</b> the engine, the wing lift, the balance of controls, and the aerodynamics. He said that {{the heat from the}} engine was [...] "fantastic", but that he placed mica sheets and deflecting plates to direct the jet blast away from the wooden fuselage. Garber wrote that as Coandă's aircraft began to move forward and rise from the ground, [...] "the exhaust flame, instead of fanning outward, curved inward and ignited the aircraft." [...] In this interview Coandă said that he brought the aircraft back to earth under control, but the landing was [...] "abrupt" [...] and he was thrown clear of the airframe which was consumed completely by flame, the engine reduced to [...] "a few handfuls of white powder." ...|$|E
500|$|Analysis of {{the cockpit}} area found there was bird residue and {{feathers}} on the windshield and center post. The remains of 15cowbirds were found within [...] {{of the end of}} Runway 20L. These birds, the NTSB found, had collided with the <b>aircraft</b> <b>structure.</b> Examination of the two engines found evidence of foreign objects, which consisted of minute fragments of feathers. The objects had blocked cooling ports, and had damaged the rotor assembly inside the engine. It was found the left engine had encountered 14 separate bird strikes and the right engine had encountered five. When the birds entered the engine, they caused the compressors to stall; these were the two loud bangs the witnesses heard as the aircraft took off. As the aircraft passed over the perimeter fence, the left engine flamed out, and the trail of smoke was unburned fuel passing through the hot combustion and turbine sections. Investigators determined it was possible the flight crew had managed to restart the left engine.|$|E
