Both films have been criticised for deviating from the poem's plot. Also, Bertilak <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> Knight are never connected. French/Australian director Martin Beilby directed a short (30') film adaptation in 2014. There {{have been at least}} two television adaptations, Gawain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> Knight in 1991 and the animated Sir Gawain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> Knight in 2002. The BBC broadcast a documentary presented by Simon Armitage in which the journey depicted in the poem is traced, using what are believed to be the actual locations.|$|E

5|$|Sir Gawain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> Knight {{was adapted}} into an opera called Gawain by Harrison Birtwistle, first {{performed}} in 1991. Birtwistle's opera was praised {{for maintaining the}} complexity of the poem while translating it into lyric, musical form. Another operatic adaptation is Lynne Plowman's Gwyneth <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Green</b> Knight, first performed in 2002. This opera uses Sir Gawain as the backdrop but refocuses the story on Gawain's female squire, Gwyneth, who is trying to become a knight. Plowman's version was praised for its approachability, as its target is the family audience and young children, but criticised for its use of modern language and occasional preachy nature.|$|E

5|$|Like its sibling V-Bombers, the Victor {{made use}} of the Navigational and Bombing System (NBS); a little-used optical sight had also been {{installed}} upon early aircraft. For navigation and bomb-aiming purposes, the Victor employed numerous radar systems.

Radar information was inputted into the onboard electromechanical analogue bomb-aiming apparatus. Some of the navigation and targeting equipment was either directly descended from, or shared concepts with, those used on Handley Page's preceding Halifax bomber. Operationally, {{the accuracy of the}} bomb-aiming system proved to be limited to roughly 400 yards, which was deemed sufficient for high-level nuclear strike operations.|$|E
