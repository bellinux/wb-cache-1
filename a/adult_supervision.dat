5|$|ETS, whose {{prestige}} {{enhanced the}} credibility of its findings, conducted two landmark summative evaluations in 1970 and 1971, demonstrating that Sesame Street had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies illustrated the early educational effects of Sesame Street, and have been cited in other studies {{of the effects of}} television on young children. ETS reported that the children who watched the show most learned the most, and achieved better results in letter-recognition skills. Three-year-olds who watched regularly scored higher than five-year-olds who did not; children from low-income households who were regular viewers scored higher than children from higher-income households who watched the show less frequently. Similar results occurred in children from non-English-speaking homes. Although <b>adult</b> <b>supervision</b> was not required for children to learn using the material presented, children who watched and discussed the program with their parents gained more skills than those who did not. Children viewing the show in an informal home setting learned as much as children who watched it at school under a teacher's supervision. Regular viewers adjusted better to the school environment than non-viewers. They also had a more positive attitude toward school and better peer relations than non-viewers.|$|E

Technology that facilitates rapid prototyping and rapid manufacturing has become increasingly available to the ordinary user in the home, the office, or at school. These rapid prototyping technologies should make it possible to offer school children the opportunity to design and then realise three dimensional (3 D) objects. One of the perceived benefits of this is that children can become more involved in the process of producing 3 D objects. Unfortunately, {{because of the nature of}} the available of the technology, and the issues associated with access to materials, <b>adult</b> help, <b>supervision</b> and assistance are often required, depriving children of the opportunity to create and produce freely, taking ownership of the process. This study evaluates the different techniques and materials available to children, highlighting their benefits and limitations, and reaching a conclusion about which materials and techniques are the most suitable for achieving a child-led approach to production. The study concludes that Cubify Cube is the most appropriate solution in terms of ease of use, not requiring <b>adult</b> assistance or <b>supervision</b> or the realisation of designs...|$|R

40|$|Learning {{under an}} <b>adult’s</b> <b>supervision</b> {{is one of}} the {{essential}} conditions for child development. For the benefit of a child’s innate liveliness and his spontaneous discovery of the world, and in order to promote individuality, there is a call for new teaching methods at schools and nursery schools. This, however, entails boards of competent teachers with the necessary knowlege and skills at enhancing their pupils’ creativity and inventivess. Polish Foundation of Children and Teenagers in Warsaw, given assistance by Bernard Van Leer Foundation, has already prepared and carried out an educational programme intended for ore-school teaching circles. The programme propagated new methods of teaching children aged from 3 to 6. The presented article shows the programme’s evaluation research conducted on children. The research tried to provide an answer to the following question: do heightened competence of pre-school teachers’ and implementation of the new programme for working with children affect children’s development. The subject of analysis heavily relied on the children-made works, such sa: a picture of a human being, a picture on a freely-chosen subject and a picture Urban-Jellen’s Creative Thinking Test. In the research procedure both model and inspection nursery schools were taken into account. In the model nursery schools the teachers participated in the educational programme, and, supposedly, implemented the new programme for working with children. In the inspected nursery schools the teachers worked under traditional guidelines for teaching. Research conducted in 1997 focused on 120 children from Lublin, Kielce and Ło´dz´: 60 from model institutions and 60 from the inspection ones (before teachers’ training). The research was subsequently continued in the consecutive years and finishhed up in 1999. Consequently, a very rich, empirical material was collected, comprising qualitative analyses of the assembled children’s works. In order to objectify the results, homogeneous (equal for all children) research conditions were closely followed, whereas the analyses (according to carefully worked out criteria) were all done by the author herself. Detailed analysis of the children-made works showed that there are differences between the children from model nursery schools and the inspection ones, in reference to constructing subject-based pictures. Similarly, the results of Creative Thinking Test significantly differed in the researched groups. In both cases the differences proved beneficial to the model schools children. Hence, the heightening of pre-school teachers’ level of competence and implementation of the new programme radically affect child development...|$|R

The majority of these problematic behaviors occur in non-classroom settings, where students outnumber staff and structure is lacking. Although strategies, like active supervision, are effective at reducing problem behavior in these settings, adults often miss opportunities to implement these strategies to achieve desired results. Project RECESS (Restructuring Environmental Contingencies and Enhancing Self-Managed Supervision) introduces a behavioral approach to increase <b>adult</b> active <b>supervision</b> through the use of self-management. Specifically, four recess supervisors participated in a brief training on active supervision and engaged in self-management by filling out a supervision checklist and direct behavior ratings (DBR). Using a multiple baseline across participants design, I introduced the intervention to participants in a randomly assigned order, and I examined the fidelity, effects (measured by direct observations of staff and students and recordings of interactions), and social validity of the RECESS intervention. Results suggest that the brief training and self-management may be associated with increases in some of the active supervision interactions, specifically prompting and praising. There was no change in students’ problematic behavior, although it was at low levels through each phase. This exploratory study has potential implications for schools, and researchers...|$|R
