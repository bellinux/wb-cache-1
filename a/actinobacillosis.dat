50|$|The {{bacterium}} {{has many}} strains {{and is the}} pathogen responsible for <b>Actinobacillosis</b> in pigs of all ages. It can also infect wild birds, domestic ruminants, dogs, cats and horses.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} common forms seen by veterinarians is mouth <b>actinobacillosis</b> of cattle, due to Actinobacillus lignieresii. The most {{prominent}} symptom is the swelling of the tongue that comes out of the mouth and is very hard at palpation (wooden tongue).|$|E
50|$|The {{infection}} is most commonly caused by abrasions on different soft tissues {{through which the}} bacteria, Actinobacillus lignieresii, enters. These soft tissues include subcutaneous tissues, the tongue, lymph nodes, lungs, and various tissues in the gastrointestinal tract. The injury results in different forms and locations of the disease depending on {{the location of the}} tissue. The commensal bacteria is also commonly found in the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and reproductive tract, sometimes resulting in disease. There are generally one or two cases of <b>actinobacillosis</b> per herd found in adult cows, foals or adult horses, and other similar animals.|$|E
40|$|Infection with Actinobacillus lignieresi {{is found}} {{frequently}} in the bovine here in the Middle West. Too frequently the term actinomycosis is used to include those lesions of both the soft tissues and bones {{of the head and}} mandible. As a general rule, we find <b>actinobacillosis</b> involving the soft tissue with Actinomyces bovis invading the bony tissue. <b>Actinobacillosis</b> is found most {{frequently in the}} region of the head but may become rather generalized involving almost any tissue of the body.

40|$|<b>Actinobacillosis</b> is {{a common}} cause of {{sporadic}} infection in cattle. It was mostly characterized as a pyogranulomatous inflammation of the tongue, but also soft tissues as lymph nodes, other digestive tract localization and skin. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe an episode of granulomatous dermatitis and lymphadenitis affecting a bull herd in Argentina during 2010. Actinobacillus lignieresii was isolated from samples collected from one of the affected bulls, and characteristic lesions were observed. Lesions other than 'wooden tongue' are usually uncommon; however, <b>actinobacillosis</b> should be included as a differential diagnosis for cutaneous diseases...|$|E
40|$|A not {{pregnant}} 4 -year-old Jersey cow {{was presented}} with the sudden appearance of respiratory noise, nasal discharge and moderate respiratory difficulty. Upon physical examination a snoring-like noise, extended head and neck position, exaggerated abdominal effort, bilateral nasal discharge and left prescapular lymph node enlargement were noted. Sub-occlusion of the initial portion of the respiratory tract was suspected. Radiographic and endoscopic examinations revealed a pedunculate mass on the dorsal aspect of the rhinopharynx, which was removed with endoscopically assisted electrosurgery. Histologic examination revealed a chronic pyogranulomatous inflammation with eosinophilic club-like bodies surrounding small colonies of rod-shaped bacteria. Results of histochemical staining were consistent with Actinobacillus-like bacteria and a diagnosis of respiratory <b>actinobacillosis</b> was reached. Surgery and antibiotic therapy were resolutive, as demonstated by an endoscopic check at the second month after surgery, even without the association of the traditional iodine cure, which {{is regarded as the}} treatment of choice for <b>actinobacillosis.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Field {{experience}} with two different vaccination strategies aiming to control infections with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae in a fattening pig herd Marie Sjölund 1, 2, Per Wallgren 1, 2 * Background: The prevalence of pleurisies recorded at slaughter is increasing in Sweden, and acute outbreaks of <b>actinobacillosis</b> that require antimicrobial treatments {{have become more}} frequent.

40|$|An unusual {{occurrence}} of <b>actinobacillosis</b> was diagnosed in 4 heifers aged 8 - 15 months and 2 cattle in a dairy herd with 190 Iranian Holstein breed. Anorexia, dysphagia, drooling of normal or foodtinged saliva and presence of warts-like lesions on the dorsal surface of tongue shaft {{were observed in}} a 15 -month-old heifer without showing protrusion of tongue or presenting woody tongue and no involvement of either sulcus lingualis or tongue base. In addition to tongue, soft tissues of oral cavity and pharyngeal region including lymph nodes, salivary glands and tonsils were contained multiple whitish nodules. Histopathologically, typical pyogranulomas of <b>actinobacillosis</b> contained radiating eosinophilic clubs surrounded by many neutrophils were diagnosed. Actinobacillus lignieresii was isolated from the lesions in pure culture. Clinical examination of other animals revealed the presence of different degrees of granulomatous abscesses in soft tissues including skin around mandibles in at least 3 heifers aged 8 - 11 months and 2 cattle. Due to 4 recent droughty years feeding the heifers, dry cows and low milk producing cattle by cheap oat and wheat straw mixed with plant awns could {{be the cause of}} this event...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of pleurisies recorded at slaughter is increasing in Sweden, and acute outbreaks of <b>actinobacillosis</b> that require antimicrobial treatments {{have become more}} frequent. As an increased use of antimicrobials may result {{in the development of}} antimicrobial resistance it is essential to develop alternative measures to control the disease. Vaccinations present an appealing alternative to antimicrobial treatments. The aim of this work was to evaluate the potential of two different vaccination strategies in a specialized fattening herd affected by <b>actinobacillosis.</b> Methods The study was conducted in a specialized fattening herd employing age segregated rearing in eight units. The herd suffered from infections caused by Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 2, confirmed by necropsy and serology. The study included 54 batches of pigs grouped into five periods. Batches of pigs of the second period were vaccinated against <b>actinobacillosis</b> twice, and pigs in the fourth period were vaccinated three times. Batches of pigs of the first, third and fifth period were not vaccinated. Concentrations of serum antibodies to A. pleuropneumoniae and serum amyloid A (SAA) were analysed and production data were recorded. Results Despite vaccinating, medical treatments were required to reduce the impact of the disease. The mean incidence of individual treatments for respiratory diseases during the rearing period ranged from 0 to 4. 7 ± 1. 8 %, and was greatest during the triple vaccination period (period IV; p A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 2 {{in the absence of a}} SAA-response. The {{prevalence of}} pleuritis decreased from 25. 4 ± 6. 5 % in the first period to 5. 0 ± 3. 7 % in the fifth period (p Conclusions The vaccine did not effectively prevent clinical expression of A. pleuropneumoniae infections, but seroconversion to A. pleuropneumoniae in the absence of a SAA-response in a large number pigs indicated that the vaccine had activated the immune system. Further, the prevalence of pleuritis decreased with time. This indicates that vaccinations together with intensified medical treatments of affected pigs could be useful in reducing the impact of A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 2 infections. </p...|$|E
40|$|Cough is {{the element}} for {{monitoring}} and diagnosis of respiratory disease cause of mortality {{and loss of}} productivity in pig houses. In order to prevent {{as much as possible}} the outbreak of such diseases the aim of this research is to describe acoustic features of cough sounds originating from infections due to <b>Actinobacillosis</b> and Pasteurellosis and to compare them with healthy cough sounds provoked by inhalation of citric acid. The acoustic parameters investigated are peak frequency [Hz] and duration of cough signals. The differences resulting from the cough sound analysis confirmed a variability in acoustics parameters according to a state of health or disease in the animals. Sound analysis provides physic acoustic features that can be used as tool to label and detect cough in a automatic monitoring system applied in farms...|$|E
40|$|In {{the winter}} of 1987 / 88 a {{previously}} unrecognized septicemic disease syndrome — <b>actinobacillosis</b> in mature sows and gilts — was diagnosed in two minimal-disease swine herds in southwestern Ontario. In herd 1, 34 sows, 2 boars, 13 feeder pigs, and 30 suckling pigs were affected; 11 sows, 2 feeders, and 18 suckling pigs died. In herd 2, 13 sows and 1 feeder pig were affected; 1 sow and 1 feeder pig died. The disease was manifested by moderate fever (39 - 40. 5 °C), round or rhomboid erythematous skin lesions, and inappetence. Sudden deaths without previous clinical signs were frequent. Histologically, coccobacillary thromboemboli in superficial and deep dermal vessels were associated with infarcted dermal and epidermal tissues. The causative organism, Actinobacillus suis, was isolated from the affected pigs. Treatment with commonly used antibacterial drugs was effective...|$|E
40|$|In a {{representative}} cross-sectional study during 12 {{months of the}} years 2008 / 2009 in four abattoirs in Switzerland, lung and pleura lesions as well as lesions of slaughter carcasses and organs of 34 706 pigs were studied for frequency and type of macroscopic lesions. Of the 24276 examined pigs, 91. 2 % of the lungs, 94. 4 % {{of the heart and}} 95. 5 % of the livers showed no macroscopically visible lesions. Pigs that were produced for a label program had significantly less bronchopneumonia and pneumonia residuals, pleuritis and liver lesions due to echinococcosis. Pigs supervised by the Swiss Pig Health Service (SGD), showed significantly less bronchopneumonia and pneumonia residuals, diffuse pleuritis, pleuritis/pericarditis and milkspots compared to the non-SGD supervised farms. Thanks to the national eradication program for enzootic pneumonia (EP) and <b>actinobacillosis,</b> the health-status of lungs has been considerably improved and the prevalence of pleurisy decreased considerably. The results of this study indicate a good herd health in Swiss pig production...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Tonsils of 25 adult swine with {{inflamed}} crypts {{were screened}} {{for the presence}} of radiating clubs, and five were selected for electron microscopic study of pathogenesis of clubs. Radiating clubs in crypts were surrounded by an exudate which principally contained neutrophils. Clubs were present on the outer surface of bacterial microcolonies; they also were present on the outer surface of plant particles wedged in crypts or on the cell walls of these particles near bacterial microcolonies. The study demonstrated development of clubs from an amorphous material derived from bacterial and leukocytic cells and also from precipitated proteins. The amorphous material was shaped into clubs by a protracted phagocytic activity of numerous neutrophilic leukocytes. The lesions with radiating clubs within crypts were not surrounded by granulomatous inflammation due to the intact epithelial lining of crypts, and therefore they differ from the granulomas having clubs around microbial colonies. They could, however, serve as models of pathogenesis of radiating clubs in the purulent core of specific granulomas with radiating clubs. Eosinophilic club-shaped bodies develop radially around microbial colonies in actinomycosis, <b>actinobacillosis,</b> botryomycosis and some mycotic infections [1 - 3, 5...|$|E
40|$|Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is a {{major cause}} of {{respiratory}} disease in pigs, causing animal suffering and substantial economic losses. The aim of this thesis was to obtain more knowledge on the protective immunity to infections with A. pleuropneumoniae and to evaluate potential strategies in preventing and combating A. pleuropneumoniae infections. Investigations regarding the role of maternal immunity {{for the protection of the}} offspring and the subsequent effect on the epidemiology on herd level demonstrated that the levels of serum antibodies to A. pleuropneumoniae in sows were reflected in colostral levels. The colostral levels were in turn reflected in the levels of serum antibodies in the offspring and piglets with high levels of antibodies also had detectable levels of antibodies for a longer time compared to the offspring to sows with low levels of antibodies to A. pleuropneumoniae. An inoculation of naïve pigs with A. pleuropneumoniae induced acute-phase protein responses. The response to the inoculation was clearly affected by the antimicrobial treatment administered at the onset of clinical signs of respiratory disease. The response of these pigs to a second inoculation was also influenced by the treatments carried out after the first inoculation. Enrofloxacin was superior in reducing clinical signs but left pigs unprotected at the second inoculation. Tetracycline demonstrated a similar treatment efficacy as enrofloxacin but pigs were protected at challenge as were the penicillin treated pigs. Penicillin was on the other hand not efficient in curing diseased pigs. The pigs that were protected from disease at the second inoculation had all developed serum antibodies to A. pleuropneumoniae following the first inoculation and an acute-phase response was not induced following the second inoculation. The results therefore indicate that antibodies mirror protection against disease well. Vaccinations against <b>actinobacillosis</b> in a fattening herd did not provide protection against clinical disease. However, in combination with intensified treatments of pigs with signs of respiratory disease, pleurisy registrations at slaughter decreased over time although the growth rate was unaffected...|$|E
