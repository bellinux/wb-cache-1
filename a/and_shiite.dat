25|$|Others defend {{neoconservative}} interventionist {{foreign policy}} from {{a view of}} cosmopolitanism for the added benefits to human rights that such intervention could bring.

According to Hezbollah-owned Al-Manar, the shooting was started by pro-government militiamen.|$|E
25|$|American {{newspaper}} The New York Sun {{reported that}} the documents described the Quds Force as not only cooperating with Shi'a death squads, but also with fighters related to al-Qaeda and Ansar al-Sunna. It said that the Quds Force had studied the Iraq situation {{in a similar manner}} to the U.S. Iraq Study Group, and had concluded that they must increase efforts with Sunni <b>and</b> <b>Shiite</b> groups in order to counter the influence of Sunni states.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} known Islamic domes in Persia, {{such as the}} Great Mosque of Qom (878) and {{the tomb}} of Muhammed b. Musa (976), seem to have continued the rounded Sasanian form. Domed mausoleums contributed greatly to the development and spread of the dome in Persia early in the Islamic period. By the 10th century, domed tombs had been built for Abbasid caliphs <b>and</b> <b>Shiite</b> martyrs. Pilgrimage to these sites may have helped to spread the form.|$|E
25|$|On February 25 Sunni <b>and</b> <b>Shiite</b> clerics {{agreed to}} {{prohibit}} killing {{members of the}} two sects and banning attacks on each other's mosques {{in an effort to}} ease tension between Iraq's Muslim communities following sectarian violence after the bombing of a Shi'ite shrine.

25|$|After {{his first}} imprisonment, his public life {{consisted}} of good works (charity, teaching, and spreading Islam), exercising public responsibility, and suffering short prison sentences for upsetting the secular authorities. Between these incarcerations, Faizani {{was able to}} create a library in Pul-i-Khumri (in Baghlan Province). It was here that Faizani attracted a large following of professionals (teachers and government officials), military personnel, and students. In time, his followers encompassed both Sunni <b>and</b> <b>Shiite</b> Muslims, an accomplishment not repeated by other groups in Afghanistan. To this day, the school of Islam that he initiated, the Madrassa-e Tawheed, consists of both Sunnis and Shi'ites.|$|E
50|$|In December 2008 some 25 {{security}} officials {{were arrested for}} membership of Awda and attempting to restore the Ba'ath party, with some claiming they were planning a coup.

2500|$|Cole {{rejects the}} Bush administrations early claims of Iraqi {{cooperation}} with Al-Qaeda, noting that Saddam Hussein had [...] "persecuted and killed both Sunni <b>and</b> <b>Shiite</b> fundamentalists in great number", {{as well as}} claims {{to the effect that}} Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction. Rather than making America safer, he says, the war has ironically had the opposite effect: inspiring anti-U.S. militants.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, as part {{of their}} [...] "Midwest Midterm Midtacular", The Daily Show visited Ohio State University and made fun of the rivalry on the final night by having {{correspondent}} Rob Riggle report while wearing a Michigan sweatshirt. This brought boos, jeers, and a few laughs from the OSU audience. After the sketch was over, Jon Stewart compared the rivalry to the disputes between Sunni <b>and</b> <b>Shiite</b> Muslims.|$|E

The legislation was introduced by Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R-NE), and it had 11 co-sponsors from Democrats and Republicans. It was referred to the House Foreign Affairs Committee ...|$|E

[...] An otherwise unknown group called the [...] "Armed Vanguards of the Second Mohammed Army" [...] claimed they were responsible for the attack.|$|E
2500|$|When in the 1980s and 1990s the inner-Islamic {{conflict}} escalated in Pakistan between Sunnite <b>and</b> <b>Shiite</b> sectarians, Islamic organizations {{represented the}} religious and political frontiers, and spread their ideas in the madrasas which they sponsored. Graduates (talib) from North Pakistani madrasas like [...] "Mullah" [...] Mohammed Omar {{played a role in}} the establishment of the Afghan Taliban regime as well as in the development of the radical Islamic terrorism. Under the pressure of Islamic terrorism, the traditional Islamic educational system together with their ulama came into general disregard within the Western world.|$|E
2500|$|U.S. President George W. Bush {{warned about}} the threat of civil war and {{expressed}} support for the Iraqi government. On February 25, Bush called seven Iraqi political leaders in an extraordinary round of telephone diplomacy aimed at getting talks restarted about forming a permanent government. On February 28, Bush decried the latest surge in sectarian violence and said that for Iraqis [...] "the choice is chaos or unity." [...] In congressional testimony, National Intelligence Director John Negroponte said a civil war in Iraq {{could lead to a}} broader conflict in the Middle East, pitting the region's Sunni <b>and</b> <b>Shiite</b> powers against one another.|$|E

50|$|After the {{decision}} of George H. W. Bush to leave Saddam Hussein in power after the first Iraq War during 1991, many neoconservatives considered this policy, and {{the decision}} not to endorse indigenous dissident groups such as the Kurds <b>and</b> <b>Shiites</b> in their 1991-1992 resistance to Hussein, as a betrayal of democratic principles.|$|R
50|$|On 11 December 2013, {{the rebel}} Islamic Front and al-Nusra Front groups {{infiltrated}} the industrial {{area of the}} town of Adra, northeast of Damascus, attacking buildings housing workers and their families.

50|$|Relations between Muslims and Jews remain quite difficult, {{exacerbated}} by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. There are inter-Muslim issues in between Sunnis <b>and</b> <b>Shiites</b> that are very much unresolved in the Middle East. Also, relations between Muslims and Hindus in India and Pakistan could theoretically be much better if interfaith efforts were more successful.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} {{religion}} of Islam, the Arabic language, number system and Arab customs spread throughout the empire. A sense of unity grew among many though not all provinces, gradually forming the consciousness of a broadly Arab-Islamic population: something which was recognizably an Islamic world had emerged {{by the end of}} the 10th century. Throughout this period, as well as in the following centuries, divisions occurred between Persians and Arabs, <b>and</b> Sunnis <b>and</b> <b>Shiites,</b> <b>and</b> unrest in provinces empowered local rulers at times.|$|R
50|$|Because of its {{proximity}} to the border of Afghanistan, in recent years, the economy of Parachinar has been adversely affected, with tourism in steep decline.
