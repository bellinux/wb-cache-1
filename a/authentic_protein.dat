40|$|The structure, stability, and unfolding-refolding {{kinetics}} of Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant goat α-lactalbumin {{were studied}} by circular dichroism spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and stopped-flow measurements, {{and the results}} were compared with those of the <b>authentic</b> <b>protein</b> prepared from goat milk. The electric properties of the two proteins were also studied by gel electrophoresis and ion-exchange chromatography. Although the overall structures of the authentic and recombinant proteins are the same, the extra methionine residue at the N terminus of the recombinant protein remarkably affects the native-state stability and the electric properties. The native state of the recombinant protein was 3. 5 kcal/mol less stable than the <b>authentic</b> <b>protein,</b> and the recombinant protein was more negatively charged than the authentic one. The recombinant protein unfolded 5. 7 times faster than the authentic one, although {{there were no significant differences}} in the refolding rates of the two proteins. The destabilization of the recombinant protein can be fully interpreted in terms of the increased unfolding rate of the protein, indicating that the N-terminal region remains unorganized in the transition state of refolding, and hence is not involved in the folding initiation site of the protein. A comparison of the X-ray structures of recombinant α-lactalbumin determined here with that of the <b>authentic</b> <b>protein</b> shows that the structural differences between the proteins are confined to the N-terminal region. Theoretical considerations for the differences in the conformational and solvation free energies between the proteins show that the destabilization of the recombinant protein is primarily due to excess conformational entropy of the N-terminal methionine residue in the unfolded state, and also due to less exposure of hydrophobic surface on unfolding. The results suggest that when the N-terminal region of a protein has a rigid structure, expression of the protein by E. coli, which adds the extra methionine residue, destabilizes the native state through a conformational entropy effect. It also shows that differences in the electrostatic interactions of the N-terminal amino group with the side-chain atoms of Thr 38, Asp 37, and Asp 83 bring about a difference in the pKa value of the N-terminal amino group between the proteins, resulting in a greater negative net charge of the recombinant protein at neutral pH...|$|E

The banding pattern of <b>authentic</b> secreted <b>proteins</b> synthesized in tissue slices was largely congruent with that obtained from the translation products of rough microsomes indicating {{that the bulk of}} the mRNA engaged with rough microsomes codes for secretory proteins.

By using Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation, both transient expression in N. benthamiana plants and stable expression of the human protein in Nicotiana tabacum cv. 81 V 9 were achieved. Immunoassays such as Western blot and ELISA (the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) showed high-level accumulation of the recombinant protein.

40|$|Baculovirus and {{vaccinia virus}} vectors {{were used to}} express the small (S) and medium (M) genome {{segments}} of Hantaan virus. Expression of the complete S or M segments yielded proteins electrophoretically indistinguishable from Hantaan virus nucleocapsid protein or envelope glycoproteins (G 1 and G 2), and expression of portions of the M segment, encoding either G 1 or G 2 alone, similarly yielded proteins which closely resembled <b>authentic</b> Hantaan virus <b>proteins.</b> The expressed envelope proteins retained all antigenic sites defined {{by a panel of}} monoclonal antibodies to Hantaan virus G 1 and G 2 and elicited antibodies in animals which reacted with <b>authentic</b> viral <b>proteins.</b> A Hantaan virus infectivity challenge model in hamsters was used to assay induction of protective immunity by the recombinant-expressed proteins. Recombinants expressing both G 1 and G 2 induced higher titer antibody responses than those expressing only G 1 or G 2 and protected most animals from infection with Hantaan virus. Baculovirus recombinants expressing only nucleocapsid protein also appeared to protect some animals from challenge. Passively transferred neutralizing monoclonal antibodies similarly prevented infection, suggesting that an antibody response alone is sufficient for immunity to Hantaan virus...|$|R
40|$|Recombinant vaccinia viruses {{containing}} the 22 -kilodalton protein (matrixlike or 22 K protein) or phosphoprotein gene from {{respiratory syncytial virus}} were constructed. These recombinant viruses expressed proteins which were immunoprecipitated by appropriate respiratory syncytial virus antibodies and comigrated with <b>authentic</b> <b>proteins</b> produced by respiratory syncytial virus infection. The new recombinant viruses (and others previously described {{containing the}} attachment glycoprotein, fusion, or nucleoprotein genes of respiratory syncytial virus) were used to infect target cells for cultured polyclonal cytotoxic T lymphocytes generated from the spleens of BALB/c or DBA/ 2 mice primed by intranasal infection with respiratory syncytial virus. Respiratory syncytial virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) showed strong Kd (but not Dd) -restricted recognition of the 22 K protein. As previously reported, the fusion protein and nucleoprotein were both seen by CTL, but recognition of these proteins was comparatively weak. There was no detectable recognition of other respiratory syncytial virus proteins tested (including phosphoprotein). 22 K protein-specific splenic memory CTL persisted for at least 11 months after infection of BALB/c mice. Priming BALB/c mice with recombinant vaccinia virus containing the 22 K protein gene induced respiratory syncytial virus-specific memory CTL at lower levels than that previously reported following infection with a similar recombinant containing the fusion protein gene. These data identify the 22 K protein as a major target antigen for respiratory syncytial virus-specific CTL from H- 2 d mice primed by respiratory syncytial virus infection...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, Hsp 90 {{was one of}} {{the least}} well {{understood}} of the molecular chaperones, but considerable progress is now being made in unravelling its biochemistry. Hsp 90 has now been shown to possess an inherent ATPase that is essential for the activation of <b>authentic</b> 'client' <b>proteins</b> in vivo and in vitro. The molecular detail of Hsp 90 's interactions with co-chaperones is also becoming clearer and the identification of key roles in assembling regulatory and signalling pathways has made it a target for anticancer drug development. Despite this, a clear understanding of how Hsp 90 contributes to the folding and/or activation of its client proteins remains some way off...|$|R
