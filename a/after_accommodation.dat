On 27 September {{the sea was}} calm enough to allow the spare seaplane to be assembled. Ernst-Felix Krüder and his navigation officer Leutnant Wilhelm Michaelsen conceived and developed a plan to lay mines in six Australian and Tasmanian sea lanes, but it would require two ships. On 7 October off Christmas Island a vessel crossing the raider's path was flagged down and ordered to stop with a 75 mm warning shot. The vessel stopped and surrendered. The vessel was identified as the Norwegian motor-tanker Storstad carrying a cargo of 12,000 tons of diesel oil and 500 tons of heavy fuel oil.

40|$|A {{previous}} study in chickens revealed that myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), f actin, and myosin are {{found on the}} crystalline lens. Their polygonal arrangement at the posterior surface resembles a muscle tissue, which suggests that these proteins may have a contractile role in accommodation. The ciliary muscle in chickens is skeletal in nature and, therefore, chickens were {{used to test the}} hypothesis that contractile microfilaments play a role in accommodation. Ciliary nerve-induced accommodation was measured in the presence of an MLCK inhibitor 1 -(5 -Iodonaphthalene- 1 -sulfonyl) - 1 H-hexahydro- 1, 4 -diazepine hydrochloride (ML- 7). Eyes of 6 -day old white Leghorn chickens (gallus gallus domesticus) were enucleated in Tyrode’s saline solution while keeping the ciliary nerve intact. One eye was treated with ML- 7 and the other eye was treated with vehicle only. Three concentrations of ML- 7 were used: 1 µM, 10 µM, and 100 µM. Two experiments were carried out, one including a (3 × 10 min) wash and one without. Focal lengths of the vehicle- and ML- 7 -treated eyes were measured before, during and <b>after</b> <b>accommodation.</b> Immunoblots were used to detect the amount of phosphorylated myosin with and without the inhibitor. Focal lengths for accommodation were shorter than those at rest (p< 0. 001). In the wash experiment, vehicle-treated eyes had higher accommodative amplitudes compared to ML- 7 -treated eyes for all three dosage groups. In the no-wash experiment, only the 1 µM group demonstrated the same trend as the wash experiment. For the 10 µM and 100 µM groups, ML- 7 -treated eyes had higher accommodative amplitudes compared to vehicle-treated eyes. Immunoblots revealed varying amounts of inhibition within pairs of eyes as well as between birds for both experiments. Results from this experiment indicate that ML- 7 was not effective at determining whether contractile microfilaments found on the lens contribute to accommodation...|$|E
40|$|ArticleAmyloidopathy {{involves}} {{the accumulation of}} insoluble amyloid b (Ab) species in the brain’s parenchyma and is a key histopathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Work on transgenic mice that overexpress Ab suggests that elevated Ab levels in the brain are associated with aberrant epileptiform activity and increased intrinsic excitability (IE) of CA 1 hippocampal neurons. In this study we examined if similar changes could be observed in hippocampal CA 1 pyramidal neurons from aged PDAPP mice (20 – 23 month old, Indiana mutation: V 717 F on APP gene) compared to their age-matched wild-type littermate controls. Whole-cell current clamp recordings revealed that sub-threshold intrinsic properties, such as input resistance, resting membrane potential and hyperpolarization activated “sag” were unaffected, but capacitance was significantly decreased in the transgenic animals. No differences between genotypes were observed in {{the overall number of}} action potentials (AP) elicited by 500 ms supra-threshold current stimuli. PDAPP neurons, however, exhibited higher instantaneous firing frequencies <b>after</b> <b>accommodation</b> in response to high intensity current injections. The AP waveform was narrower and shorter in amplitude in PDAPP mice: these changes, according to our in silico model of a CA 1 / 3 pyramidal neuron, depended on the respective increase and reduction of KC and NaC voltage-gated channels maximal conductances. Finally, the after-hyperpolarization, seen after the first AP evoked by a + 300 pA current injection and after 50 Hz AP bursts, was more pronounced in PDAPP mice. These data show that Ab-overexpression in aged mice altered the capacitance, the neuronal firing and the AP waveform of CA 1 pyramidal neurons. Some of {{these findings are consistent with}} previous work on younger PDAPP; they also show important differences that can be potentially ascribed to the interaction between amyloidopathy and ageing. Such a change of IE properties over time underlies that the increased incidence of seizure observed in AD patients might rely on different mechanistic pathways during progression of the disease.

40|$|Following {{the amazing}} {{progresses}} in miniaturizing essential components of spacecraft, {{the last decade}} has witnessed an important development of nano- and micro-satellites. Beyond the mere technological experiment, these small satellites are now considered as important complements of much larger and more sophisticated probes to do scientific research. In this context we are conducting a feasibility study of a UV photometer on-board a 3 U CubeSat. The scientific purpose of this payload will be to collect time series of photometric measurements of bright massive stars. These massive stars are very hot and luminous objects emitting copious amounts of UV radiation. The properties of these stars during their life and their death in gigantic supernova explosions make them key players for the evolution of the Universe. The UV photometer will be used for imaging photometric observations of massive stars in the spectral range from 250 to 350 nm. The strength of space photometry is the absence of signal perturbation by the Earth’s atmosphere and the continuity of the time-series. Precisely measuring photometric variations allows studying radial and non-radial pulsations of stars. This discipline, called asteroseismology, is currently the most powerful technique for probing the physical conditions in the interiors of stars. An important problem in asteroseismology of massive stars is the mode identification. Simultaneous observations in the near UV (250 - 350 nm) and in the visible (600 nm) provide the best combination for precise and accurate mode identification based on amplitude ratios in massive stars. Data in the latter pass-band are currently covered by the satellites of the BRITE constellation. Combining the observations of our instrument with those of BRITE will hence result in unprecedented results for pulsating massive stars. The baseline for the UV photometer is a Ritchey-Chrétien telescope composed of two reflective hyperbolic mirrors that focalize the light coming from space onto a focal plane protected by an optical filter. We will present the optimized optical design of the payload and its associated optical sensor. A photometric budget taking into account the characteristics of the target’s stars and the payload performances will also be presented. We will further discuss the observation strategy. Finally, the accommodation of the payload in the spacecraft and its sub-units will be shown as well as mission and preliminary thermal analyses of the whole system obtained <b>after</b> <b>accommodation...</b>|$|E

40|$|The word {{regeneration}} features {{prominently in}} the official documentation of the London 2012 organisers, the International Olympic Committee, various books, articles and journals, especially in relation to justifying the hosting of mega-events. Exactly what does the word mean and is it the correct word to use? London 2012 intends to transform {{the lives of the}} people of East London through the social, physical and economic changes, in that ‘regeneration’ means keeping the same social classes and improving the facilities and infrastructure for their benefit. However, experience from past Games has proven that in most case the ex-athletes village properties’ become sort <b>after</b> <b>accommodation</b> through their location, historical significance and in particular with Sydney, their high environmental standards. These properties therefore appreciate in value very quickly and become occupied by middle class, thus causing a renaissance of the area rather than regeneration (Mace et al, 2007). In addition there is also social rejuvenation relating to reversing the decline of an area without specifying for whom the improvements are necessarily intended. Is it feasible to accommodate mix use housing? Will the Games organisers eventually need to maximise their return on the sale of the properties and therefore reduce the size of the affordable housing stock? Will the true locals benefit from the organisers plans for the area? Many of the answers to these questions can be considered by studying past Games’ experiences, particularly lessons to be learnt from Barcelona and Sydney. Several in-depth interviews with stakeholders of the Games have been conducted, using stakeholder theory for the theoretical underpinning (Friedman and Miles, 2002). A phenomenological stance is taken as it is an approach that focuses on how life is experienced and the use of interviews from past-Games will help with predicting what could happen in London. It is the perceptions, meanings, attitudes and feelings that are important to discuss as these experiences tell a story. Whilst the interviews were conducted by city, the semi-structured approach to interview protocol has allowed each interview to be iterative, in that new themes emerging are included in subsequent interviews. The sampling is purposive, whereby each interviewee has a role within the Olympic planning from the perspective of the local community. The data from the interviews has been analysed via thematic analysis, using Ritchie and Spencer’s Framework (1994) ...|$|E
