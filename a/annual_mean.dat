40|$|Understanding spatial {{patterns}} of species diversity {{is a hot}} topic in global ecology because of its significance to biodiversity conservation. We investigated spatial {{patterns of}} Chinese seed plant species diversity and analyzed the correlation between species richness and climatic factors at a large scale. Floral information was obtained from national and regional records of seed plants, and climatic data were taken from 642 observatory sites across China between 1970 and 2000. We detected large spatial variation in speciesrichness and density. Species density decreased with latitude. The following {{did not affect the}} spatial patterns of species richness and species density: area, <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> temperature, <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> precipitation, and frost-free days. Spatial patterns of species richness were affected by <b>annual</b> variation in <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> temperature, <b>mean</b> temperature during the coldest month, spatial variation of <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> temperature and precipitation. Spatial patterns of species density were principally shaped by <b>annual</b> variation in <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> temperature, <b>mean</b> temperature during the coldest month, spatial variation of <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> temperature per unit area and spatial variation of <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> precipitation per unit area.

Impact of long-term climatic controls (e. g., precipitation, potential evapotranspiration (ETP)) on <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> water balance was also investigated with Fu’s Equation.

On average, 40 % of long-term precipitation in the study watersheds was converted into surface runoff. The performance of Fu’s Equation in estimating <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> streamflow resulted in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value of 64. 1 mm/year. <b>Mean</b> <b>annual</b> streamflow was sensitive to changes in <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> precipitation, and less sensitive to changes in <b>mean</b> <b>annual</b> ETp in the watersheds.
