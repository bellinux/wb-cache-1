5|$|On December 1, 2006, {{a private}} party {{was held at}} the Jena Fair Barn. Bailey and four other black youths tried to enter the party at about 11:00p.m. According to U.S. Attorney Washington, they were told by a woman that no one was allowed inside without an invitation. The youths persisted, stating that some friends were already at the party. <b>A</b> <b>white</b> <b>male,</b> who was not a student, moved in front of the woman and a fight ensued. After the fight broke up, the woman told both the white male and the black {{students}} to leave the party. Once outside, the black students were involved in another fight with a group of white males who were not students. Justin Sloan, <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>male,</b> was charged with battery {{for his role in the}} fight and was put on probation. Bailey later said that one of the white males broke a beer bottle over his head, but there are no records of Bailey receiving medical treatment.|$|E

25|$|I {{think that}} in some quarters, {{many parts of the}} country, <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>male</b> is really disadvantaged… Because we have {{developed}} this notion of women and minorities being so disadvantaged and we have to help them, that we have, in many cases, twisted the thing so that it's no longer a case of equal opportunity. It's a case of putting a fist on the scale.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that, in the United States, several {{minority}} groups, including black men and women, Hispanic men and women, and white women, suffer from decreased wage earning for the same job with the same performance levels and responsibilities as white males.

25|$|Patient G.D. was <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>male</b> born in 1940 {{who served}} in the Navy. He was {{diagnosed}} with chronic renal failure and received hemodialysis treatment {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1983, he went to the hospital for elective parathyroidectomy. He also had a left thyroid lobectomy because of the severe loss of blood in his left lobe. He began having cardiac problems as a result of the surgery and became very agitated. Even five days after being released from the hospital he was unable to remember what had happened to him. Aside from memory impairment, none of his other cognitive processes seemed to be affected. He did not want to be involved in much research, but through memory tests he took with doctors, they were able to ascertain that his memory problems were present for the next 9.5 years until his death. After he died, his brain was donated to science, photographed, and preserved for future study.|$|E

However, despite Arnaz and Ball being frequently described as an [...] "interracial couple", [...] "Hispanic" [...] is generally understood to be a catchall indicating persons of a Latin American, Iberian, or Filipino cultural background, {{as opposed to a}} race. Arnaz was usually considered to be <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>male</b> of Cuban ancestry.|$|E

500|$|Originally {{operating}} as <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>male</b> school, Bacon Academy integrated [...] "negroes and persons of color" [...] around 1833 {{and began to}} educate women in 1842. The school has educated important figures like Edwin Denison Morgan, Morgan Bulkeley, William A. Buckingham, Lyman Trumbull, and Morrison Waite. Due to the structure's utilitarian style combined with its Federal details, the National Register of Historic Places recognizes it as architecturally significant. Currently, the Old Bacon Academy building is used {{as part of an}} alternative education program and Day Hall is used as a nursery.

He was arrested after being detained by bystanders, and police later released his name and details.

500|$|Having {{spent almost}} two years working on the novel, Cleave decided upon using the dual narrative, as: [...] "This {{is a story of}} two worlds: the {{developed}} and the developing, and of the mutual incomprehension that sometimes dooms them to antagonism." [...] He found it technically challenging to write from a female perspective, but felt that it prevented him from unwittingly using his own voice to animate the characters, explaining: [...] "It forces me to listen, to think, and to write more precisely." [...] Kaminski accused Cleave of cultural appropriation, asking rhetorically: [...] "When <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>male</b> author writes as a young Nigerian girl, is it an act of empathy, or identity theft?" [...] Cleave has responded by stating that he sympathises with those who feel he has no right to write {{from the perspective of a}} Nigerian girl, but feels that he does it well. He believes that the best mechanism for telling a story about crossing borderlines is to depict both sides. He conducted interviews with actual asylum seekers and illegal immigrants, a psychiatrist specialising in the trauma of child refugees, and members of London's Nigerian community, researching speech patterns to shape the [...] "quirks and cadences" [...] of Little Bee's narrative voice.|$|E
500|$|Many major {{editorial}} pages and columnists have been {{sympathetic to the}} supporters of the Jena Six. They have used the case to discuss broader trends of racism in the US criminal justice system and {{to call for a}} renewed civil rights movement. Most editorials were published {{around the time of the}} Jena rally. The New York Post, in a September 23, 2007, editorial, stated [...] "it's impossible to examine the case of the so-called Jena Six without concluding that these black teens have been the victims of a miscarriage of justice, with a clearly racial double standard at work." [...] Byron Williams, writing on the Huffington Post, was one of several to cite the Urban League's 2005 finding that the average black male convicted of aggravated assault serves 48months in prison, one-third longer than a comparable white man. The 2005 report also found that a black male who is arrested is three times more likely to go to jail than <b>a</b> <b>white</b> <b>male</b> arrested for the same crime. Citing the same statistics, syndicated columnist Clarence Page wrote that [...] "The best legacy for the Jena March 6would be a new movement, dedicated this time to the reduction and elimination of unequal justice wherever it appears. I don't care who leads it, but it shouldn't be for blacks only." [...] Writing in the New York Times, Professor Orlando Patterson of Harvard University used the case to highlight the use of the prison system as a means of [...] "controlling young black men", which is one factor in a broader [...] "crisis in relations between men and women of all classes and, as a result, the catastrophic state of black family life".|$|E
