40|$|Objectives: To {{understand}} {{views of}} pharmacy advisers about smoker {{recruitment and retention}} in the National Health Service community pharmacy stop smoking programme. Design: Thematic framework analysis of semistructured, in-depth interviews applying the Theoretical Domains Framework and COM-B behaviour change model. We aimed to identify aspects of adviser behaviour that might be modified to increase numbers joining and completing the programme. Participants: 25 stop smoking advisers (13 pharmacists and 12 support staff). Setting: 29 community pharmacies in 3 inner east London boroughs. Results: Advisers had preconceived ideas about smokers likely to join or drop out and made judgements about smokers' readiness to quit. Actively recruiting smokers was accorded low priority due in part <b>to</b> perceived insufficient <b>remuneration</b> <b>to</b> the pharmacy and anticipated challenging interactions with smokers. Suggestions to improve smoker recruitment and retention included developing a more holistic and supportive approach using patient-centred communication. Training counter assistants were seen to be important as was flexibility to extend the programme duration to fit better with smokers’ needs. Conclusions: Cessation advisers feel they lack the interpersonal skills necessary to engage well with smokers and help them to quit. Addressing advisers' behaviours about active engagement and follow-up of clients, together with regular skills training including staff not formally trained as cessation advisers, could potentially boost numbers recruited and retained in the stop smoking programme. <b>Adjustments</b> <b>to</b> the pharmacy <b>remuneration</b> structure <b>to</b> incentivise recruitment and to allow personalisation of the programme for individual smokers should also be considered...|$|R

40|$|MBA thesisThe {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine what}} the factors are that drive changes <b>to</b> <b>remuneration</b> policy in South Africa, and {{to determine the extent}} of changes to the components of remuneration policies since 2008. A similar study was undertaken by Bussin in 2003 and the results between the two studies were compared. The data was collected via an anonymous e-mail questionnaire and analysed using quantitative techniques. The key findings were that the retention of key staff and an organisation‘s financial results were primary drivers of changes <b>to</b> <b>remuneration</b> policy; these findings concurred with the 2003 study. However, factors linked to corporate governance, such as Remuneration Committees, Shareholder expectations, Governance/King III have all increased in perceived importance as factors driving changes <b>to</b> <b>remuneration</b> policy. The components of <b>remuneration</b> policies linked <b>to</b> Merit Pay and Retention Strategies appear to have been subject to the most changes since 2003. This could also reflect shareholder expectations that employee pay should be closely aligned to performance and that key critical employees should be retained for business continuity...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop an {{in-depth}} understanding of the relative importance of the factors driving change <b>to</b> <b>remuneration</b> policy decision making and the impact on organisations. Data from 148 organisations was analysed and subjected to rigorous statistical analysis. The results show that the most potent drivers of remuneration policy are retention of key staff, financial results and organisation strategy. The greatest changes <b>to</b> <b>remuneration</b> policy were in the areas of variable pay, merit/performance related pay, market position, total package and job evaluation/ broadbanding policy.

The results indicated that there were substantive direct relations between personality traits and occupational career success. Extraversion related positively <b>to</b> <b>remuneration</b> but only for men. Emotional stability was positively related <b>to</b> <b>remuneration</b> for both genders. Agreeableness {{was not associated with}} career outcomes. Conscientiousness was negatively related to womens upward status mobility. Openness to experience was negatively related to earnings, but only for men. Model comparisons indicated that models of career success that excluded personality traits had to be rejected. It is concluded that personality characteristics contribute importantly to earnings and status attainment, in addition to sociological variables. ...|$|R

Meta-analytic results indicate that <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> college is multidimensional, predictive of college grades, and an unusually good predictor of college retention. <b>Adjustment</b> <b>to</b> college is also shown to be moderately related to individual traits, social support, and students’ relationships with their parents.

40|$|To explore older adults’ {{perceptions}} of subjective age and <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> ageing and to analyse the correlational {{structure of the}} pre-categories in our study: subjective age, indicators of <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> ageing and of personal age perception. An exploratory, descriptive mixed-methods design was utilised. A purposive sampling method was used to select 154 older adults aged between 75 and 99 years from three different nationalities. Semi-structured interviews were performed, addressing two core areas: subjective age and <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> ageing. Data was subjected to content analysis. Representation of the correlational structure of the precategories in our study (subjective age and indicators of <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> ageing) were analysed by a Multiple Correspondence Analysis. Standardised instruments measured regular cognitive abilities. Five categories derived from interviews for subjective age: ‘adapted’, ‘disconnected’, ‘old’, ‘youthful’ and ‘tolerant’. A total of seven categories emerged as indicators of <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> ageing: ‘social networking’, ‘health’, ‘time perspective’, ‘spirituality’, ‘financial autonomy’, ‘professional activities’ and ‘fulfilment and leisure’. These results supported a model for each pre-category. Subjective age was explained by a two-factor model: ‘age-conscientious’ and ‘youthful’. A three-dimensional model formed by ‘reconciled’, ‘satisficers’ and ‘maximisers’ was indicated as a best-fit solution for <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> ageing. A three-dimensional overall model for PAP was formed by ‘age-cognisant’, ‘fulfilled’ and ‘satisficers’. The findings highlighted the underdeveloped potential of subjective age, <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> ageing and a personal age perception overall model for this population. Enhancing subjective age and <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> ageing might be an important target to improve older adults’ interventions’ outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Two studies {{tested a}} model in which passion for work predicts {{psychological}} <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> retirement through the satisfaction of basic psychological needs. With a sample of 103 French-Canadian retirees {{from a variety of}} occupations, the first study used a retrospective cross-sectional design. The second study followed 73 French-Canadian teachers over a 6 -year period and examined the relationship between passion for work, assessed when participants were still working, and psychological <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> retirement, measured when participants were retired. All participants completed questionnaires on demographics, passion for work, basic psychological needs and psychological <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> retirement. Results from structural equation modeling confirmed the hypothesized model, such that both studies confirmed the mediating role of basic psychological need satisfaction in the passion–psychological <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> retirement relationship. Need satisfaction significantly mediated the relationship between harmonious passion for work and psychological <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> retirement in Studies 1 and 2. The mediation was also confirmed between obsessive passion and psychological <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> retirement in Study 1, but not in Study 2. These findings suggest that passion for work matters in psychological <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> retirement. Being passionate about work can thus lead to positive or negative outcomes in retirement, depending on whether the passion is harmonious or obsessive, respectively...|$|R
