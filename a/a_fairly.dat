5|$|The {{presence}} of foreign residents in Cortina d'Ampezzo is <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> recent phenomenon, accounting {{for only a}} small number of inhabitants in what in any case is <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> small town.

This compares with 7.0% in the town Belluno, 6.4% in the entire province of Belluno, and 10.2% in the Veneto region.|$|E

West Exchange Street and Exchange Terrace serve as rough boundaries between the two.|$|E
5|$|Females lay up to 3,000 eggs {{in one or}} more silk egg sacs, which {{maintain}} <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> constant humidity level.
