Robert Hanbury Brown, a physicist who would later work on radar in the US, and Keith Wood joined them in August 1939, helping fitters keep the systems operational, <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> useful methods for interception. Near the end of August, Dowding visited the base and saw the radars in the nose and pointed out to Bowen that the enemy gunners would see {{the light from the}} CRTs and shoot the operator.

25|$|There {{are quite}} a few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've never really classed myself as a lead player as such, {{but this is the first}} time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, but I have no interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is definitely more melodic. Dare I say it, there {{are quite a}} lot of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E
25|$|The City of Chicago {{is looking}} into a plan for an express train that would take tourists, locals, and other {{travelers}} from downtown Chicago to O'Hare International Airport in about 20 minutes, which is half {{the time it takes}} on the City's Blue Line. If an express train does get built, one-time tickets would likely cost around $30 to $35. Less expensive monthly passes and family discounts might also become available. The City will look for a private company to cover construction costs and operate the system, but it's likely public money would go into building stations at the airport and downtown if the project moves ahead. The city says an engineering firm will spend the next 10 months evaluating potential routes, drafting designs <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a construction timeline and cost estimate, then put it out for bid in 2017. In the early 1990s, the idea of a 20-minute O'Hare express train service has been proposed. Some plans included bypass tracks on the CTA Blue Line that run {{down the middle of the}} Kennedy Expressway as well as use of a Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way near the Kennedy. However no plans were ever materialized.|$|E
25|$|The Midwest Region {{featured}} upsets {{knocking off}} the fourth through seventh seeds. Among these {{was the first}} upset of the tournament with 11th seed Kansas State's win over the sixth seeded Southern California Trojans 80-67 in Omaha, Nebraska. The media had focused {{a lot of attention}} on the freshman stars of both teams, the Wildcats' Michael Beasley and the Trojans' O. J. Mayo. In reality, while Beasley and Mayo did well, it was the other K-State players who made the difference, applying a strong defense to the Men of Troy's attack <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the school's first tournament win since 1988. Also in the Midwest Region, #10 seed Davidson defeated seventh seeded Gonzaga 82-76 in Raleigh, North Carolina. Stephen Curry led the Wildcats with 40 points, 30 of them in the second half. His 40 points are the fifth most in NCAA tournament history, and gave Davidson their first tournament win since 1969. In the same region, 13th seed Siena upset fourth seed Vanderbilt 83-62 in Tampa, Florida. Future Harlem Globetrotter Tay Fisher made all six of his 3-point attempts, the Saints never trailed and became the first MAAC team to advance since 2004. The Midwest's first-round play ended with 12th seed Villanova's upset of fifth seed Clemson, 75-69, also in Tampa. Behind by eighteen late in the first half, the Wildcats came back, taking the lead at about the twelve-minute mark and holding it for the win. The Wildcats have won more games as an underdog in the tournament since seedings began in 1979 than any other team. With Villanova's win, the Forum saw a tournament record four upsets in one day. Earlier in the day, WKU, San Diego, and Siena defeated Drake, UConn, and Vanderbilt, to set the record.|$|E

Simone ventured into Madonna's birthplace, Bay City, Michigan where she interviewed different people and came to know about the long-standing debate among its municipality about how to honor the singer, who never accrued any recognition from the mayor of Bay City. Simone documented these instances, while also reflecting on her own career as an Indie rock musician. Titled as Madonnaland: And Other Detours in Fame and Fandom, the book was released on March 1, 2016 by University of Texas Press in the United States.|$|E
500|$|On December 3, 2009, it was {{announced}} that Marilyn Manson had parted ways with their long-time record label Interscope. That same day, the band confirmed that they had been composing new material while touring in support of their previous studio album, The High End of Low (2009). The band's eponymous vocalist also suggested that a series of special one-off concerts were in development for the near future. These performances would see each album from Manson's triptych of albums (Holy Wood, Mechanical Animals and Antichrist Superstar) being played in its entirety over three different nights in the one venue. On January 12, 2010, Chris Vrenna said that the band were [...] "talking <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> concepts" [...] for an upcoming studio album.

RCA continually delayed the band from entering the studio in hopes that they could write such a song, {{but by the time the}} group had written 20 songs (including material that was eventually phased out of their concert setlist) the label still had no confidence in the new material. [...] "We really were in an amazing place, writing, jamming four to five times a week <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> great stuff," [...] recalled Heppner. [...] "We felt at the peak of our creativity. [...] And they were like, 'Can you write more songs?' (We were, like), 'This is insane.'"
