5|$|Pablo Miño was {{released}} from prison, but Curto refused to release García, saying that Miño had extenuating circumstances which García did not. Miño's job was to give García the required tools, not to do the maintenance. He was in the street, watching over the van, which was not properly parked <b>and</b> <b>locked,</b> and did not see García's work before the explosion. Curto stopped short of pronouncing Miño innocent at that early stage.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} between Bad News Brown and Ken Patera. Before the bell rang, however, Brown {{attacked}} Patera, who retaliated by performing a clothesline from the corner. Patera then slipped {{both of his}} arms underneath Brown's armpits <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> {{his hands behind his}} neck, using a submission move known as a full nelson. At the end of the match, Brown defeated Patera by striking him {{in the back of the}} head with his finishing move, the Ghetto Blaster.|$|E
5|$|According to Hayes' confession, {{the two men}} {{had planned}} to rob the Petit house under cover of {{darkness}} leaving the family bound, but unharmed. Hayes attributed the outcome to a change of plan. Upon their arrival {{in the early hours of}} July 23, they found William Petit sleeping on a couch on the porch. Komisarjevsky struck William on the head with a baseball bat found in the yard and then tied him up at gunpoint in the basement. The children and their mother were then bound <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> in their respective rooms. Hayes said that he and Komisarjevsky were not satisfied with their haul, and that a bankbook was found which showed an available balance.|$|E

5|$|Although the French and the Austrians claimed {{victory at}} the time, {{military}} historians generally agree that the Austrians achieved a strategic advantage. However, the French withdrew from the battlefield in good order and several days later crossed the Rhine River at Hüningen. A confusion of politics and diplomacy in Vienna wasted any strategic advantage that Charles might have obtained <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> the Habsburg force into two sieges on the Rhine, when the troops were badly needed in northern Italy. The battle is commemorated on a monument in Vienna and on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.|$|E

Other map icons include large boulders <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> doors that impede paths, and mini-games and bonus screens that provide the player a chance to obtain special power-ups and additional lives. Power-ups obtained in these mini-games are stored in a reserve until activated by the player from the map screen.|$|E
5|$|Dino Crisis {{features}} survival horror gameplay that is {{very similar}} to Capcom's early Resident Evil titles. Regina can walk, run, turn, backpedal, push and climb objects, and perform a 180-degree turn. A map is available which will show Regina's location, destination, save points, <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> doors. Save points are rooms which will prompt the player to save upon exiting them. Some doors are locked by a D.D.K. (digital disk key) device. To open these doors, the player will need both a code disc and input disc which can then be used to decipher a code and unlock the door. There are also force fields of red beams throughout the complex which can be activated to block access to intruders.|$|E

5|$|Falls can {{be avoided}} by {{installing}} grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairways; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and safety gates {{at the top and}} bottom of stairs around young children. Playgrounds with shock-absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. Child abuse prevention is another tactic; programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating about the dangers of shaking children. Gun safety, including keeping guns unloaded <b>and</b> <b>locked,</b> is another preventative measure. Studies on the effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United States have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries.|$|E

He was present {{at the rear of the}} Tom Tackle pub when DeSimone was dropped off by Savage, and then approached DeSimone when she got into her own vehicle. He first knocked on the window and asked the time but then forced his way into the driver's seat beside her <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> the doors to prevent her escaping. Once inside he sexually assaulted her and strangled her using the passenger seatbelt in the car. He then took her handbag and jewellery, and hid for approximately 10minutes before heading to Southampton Central station and catching a train back to Portsmouth.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{political}} moments that brought Berkman and Goldman together was the Homestead Strike. In June 1892, a steel plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania owned by Andrew Carnegie {{became the focus of}} national attention when talks between the Carnegie Steel Company and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (AA) broke down. The factory's manager was Henry Clay Frick, a fierce opponent of the union. When a final round of talks failed at the end of June, management closed the plant <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> out the workers, who immediately went on strike. Strikebreakers were brought in and the company hired Pinkerton guards to protect them. On July 6, a fight broke out between 300 Pinkerton guards and a crowd of armed union workers. During the twelve-hour gunfight, seven guards and nine strikers were killed.|$|E

The students had chained <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> the entrance to a college building to protest low numbers of black faculty and the absence of a black studies program. In April 1967 she married Louis Chesimard, a fellow student-activist at CCNY. The married life ended within a year; they divorced in December 1970.

5|$|Some Gabonese mistakenly {{identified}} the United States as a co-conspirator in the coup. Time asserted that French officials helped spread the rumor of American involvement. This {{reached a point}} which some automobile stations refused to help Darlington and other Americans. After William F. Courtney, deputy chief of the United States Embassy, {{received a call from}} a man identifying himself as DuPont and threatening an imminent attack, a hand grenade exploded outside the embassy. The explosion, which occurred {{at a time when the}} building was closed <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> on 3 March, resulted in damage to the embassy sign and the cracking of two windows.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{hypotheses}} for {{the origin}} of the Laplace resonance among Io, Europa, and Ganymede: that it is primordial and has existed {{from the beginning of the}} Solar System; or that it developed after the formation of the Solar System. A possible sequence of events for the latter scenario is as follows: Io raised tides on Jupiter, causing Io's orbit to expand (due to conservation of momentum) until it encountered the 2:1 resonance with Europa; after that the expansion continued, but some of the angular moment was transferred to Europa as the resonance caused its orbit to expand as well; the process continued until Europa encountered the 2:1 resonance with Ganymede. Eventually the drift rates of conjunctions between all three moons were synchronized <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> in the Laplace resonance.|$|E
5|$|Another tradition, {{related by}} R.C. MacLeod, told of certain events {{which took place}} after an heir to the clan's chiefship was born. The story related how at this time, there was much rejoicing at Dunvegan Castle, and since the infant's nursemaid was anxious {{to join in the}} festivities in the hall below, she left the infant alone in her room. When the baby awoke, crying of cold, no human help could hear him in his secluded room; however, a host of fairies {{appeared}} and wrapped the infant in the Fairy Flag. Meanwhile, the clansmen banqueting below demanded to see the child and the maid was ordered to bring him forth. When she brought out the baby, wrapped in the flag, everyone gazed in wonder at the child and the garb wrapped around him. The room was filled with the fairies' song which declared that the flag had the power to save the clan three times. When the song ended, and silence fell across the crowded room, the flag was taken from the infant <b>and</b> <b>locked</b> in a chest where it has ever since been preserved.|$|E
