40|$|National and {{international}} economic evaluations of antiviral medicines {{in the treatment}} of chronic hepatitis B are reviewed. Searches in a number of databases followed by reference tracking resulted in 47 publications. However, it appeared that 40 publications did not meet our inclusion criteria, so only seven publications proved relevant. The parameters that were included in the review are the types of <b>antiviral</b> <b>medicine,</b> the type of economic evaluation, the different parameters int he disease model, the time horizon of the study, the costs of the antiviral medicines, the different cost data used in the study, the sensitivity analysis, and the results of the studies. Some studies show treatment with <b>antiviral</b> <b>medicine</b> to be cost-saving, while in other studies show unfavourable cost-effectiveness ratios. These contrasting results are due to differences in parameters and methodology between the studies. The tentative conclusion of the literature review is that if quality of life effects are taken into account, treatment with antiviral medicines seems cost-effective. If the quality of life is nog estimated the cost-effectiveness ratios are less favourable. There is no 'hard' evidence that the treatment of chronic hepatitis B with antiviral medicines is cost-effective. Further research is necessary to assess the cost-effectiveness of treatment of chronic hepatitis B with antiviral medicines...|$|E
40|$|Background. Hepatitis B virus {{infection}} {{is a global}} public health problem since it is {{a leading cause of}} liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. An optimal treatment is needed to reduce mortality. Current therapies for chronic hepatitis B include standard and pegilated interferon-alfa and nucleoside and nucleotide analogies, primarily lamivudine and adefovir. Each of the therapies, however has various limitations. Case report. In this paper we presented a father and his daughter with chronic hepatitis B, successfully treated with lamivudine. Conclusion.

40|$|Background: {{during the}} 2009 - 2010 A(H 1 N 1) pandemic, {{many people did}} not seek care quickly enough, failed to take a full course of antivirals despite being {{authorised}} to receive them, and were not vaccinated. Understanding facilitators and barriers to the uptake of vaccination and <b>antiviral</b> <b>medicines</b> will help inform campaigns in future pandemic influenza outbreaks. Increasing uptake of vaccines and <b>antiviral</b> <b>medicines</b> may need to address a range of drivers of behaviour. The aim was to identify facilitators of and barriers to being vaccinated and taking <b>antiviral</b> <b>medicines</b> in uncertain and severe pandemic influenza scenarios using a theoretical model of behaviour change, COM-B. Methods: focus groups and interviews with 71 {{members of the public}} in England who varied in their at-risk status. Participants responded to uncertain and severe scenarios, and to messages giving advice on vaccination and <b>antiviral</b> <b>medicines.</b> Data were thematically analysed using the theoretical framework provided by the COM-B model. Results: influences on uptake of vaccines and <b>antiviral</b> <b>medicines</b> - capabilities, motivations and opportunities - are part of an inter-related behavioural system and different components influenced each other. An identity of being healthy and immune from infection was invoked to explain feelings of invulnerability and hence a reduced need to be vaccinated, especially during an uncertain scenario. The identity of being a ‘healthy person’ also included beliefs about avoiding medicine and allowing the body to fight disease ‘naturally’. This was given as a reason for using alternative precautionary behaviours to vaccination. This identity could be held by those not at-risk and by those who were clinically at-risk. Conclusions: promoters and barriers to being vaccinated and taking <b>antiviral</b> <b>medicines</b> are multi-dimensional and communications to promote uptake are likely to be most effective if they address several components of behaviour. The benefit of using the COM-B model is that it {{is at the core of}} an approach that can identify effective strategies for behaviour change and communications for the future. Identity beliefs were salient for decisions about vaccination. Communications should confront identity beliefs about being a ‘healthy person’ who is immune from infection by addressing how vaccination can boost wellbeing and immunity <br/...|$|R
40|$|Background: Investigators were {{suspicious}} of tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) mutations occurred only {{in patients who}} were treated by lamivudine. However, YMDD mutations of hepatitis B virus gene (HBV DNA) in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) untreated with <b>antiviral</b> <b>medicines</b> was reported in some studies. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate YMDD mutations in Iranian Patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) untreated with <b>antiviral</b> <b>medicines.</b>  Methods: In a cross sectional study, 151 adult patients with positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (78 asymptomatic hepatitis B virus carriers, 73 active chronic hepatitis B patients or cirrhosis patients) were evaluated for YMDD mutants. The patients who were treated with interferon and Lamivudine or Adfovier in one year prior to the study were excluded. YMDD mutations of HBV DNA were detected by PCR-RFLP (PCR Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) in a single laboratory.  Results: The mean (±SD) age of patients was 37 ± 4 years. Eighty one (54 %) cases were male and 70 (46 %) were female. Eight cases (5. 3 %) out of 151 had YMDD mutations. The type of mutation in all of these patients was YSDD. There was no significant relationship between YMDD mutation and viral load and HDV Ab (p> 0. 05).  Conclusions: The mutant strains of the YMDD motif of HBV polymerase can be found in some patients without lamivudine treatment. However, in view of rather clinically insignificant YMDD mutation frequency, routine testing for YMDD mutations prior to antiviral therapy is not recommended in these patients...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHuman {{enterovirus}} 71 (EV 71) is {{the main}} causative pathogen of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in children. The epidemic of HFMD has been a public health problem in Asia-Pacific region for decades, and no vaccine and effective <b>antiviral</b> <b>medicine</b> are available. Curcumin {{has been used as}} a traditional medicine for centuries to treat a diversity of disorders including viral infections. In this study, we demonstrated that curcumin showed potent antiviral effect again EV 71. In Vero cells infected with EV 71, the addition of curcumin significantly suppressed the synthesis of viral RNA, the expression of viral protein, and the overall production of viral progeny. Similar with the previous reports, curcumin reduced the production of ROS induced by viral infection. However, the antioxidant property of curcumin did not contribute to its antiviral activity, since N-acetyl-l-cysteine, the potent antioxidant failed to suppress viral replication. This study also showed that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was activated by either viral infection or curcumin treatment, but the activated ERK did not interfere with the antiviral effect of curcumin, indicating ERK is not involved in the antiviral mechanism of curcumin. Unlike the previous reports that curcumin inhibited protein degradation through ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS), we found that curcumin had no impact on UPS in control cells. However, curcumin did reduce the activity of proteasomes which was increased by viral infection. In addition, the accumulation of the short-lived proteins, p 53 and p 21, was increased by the treatment of curcumin in EV 71 -infected cells. We further probed the antiviral mechanism of curcumin by examining the expression of GBF 1 and PI 4 KB, both of which are required for the formation of viral replication complex. We found that curcumin significantly reduced the level of both proteins. Moreover, the decreased expression of either GBF 1 or PI 4 KB by the application of siRNAs was sufficient to suppress viral replication. We also demonstrated that curcumin showed anti-apoptotic activity at the early stage of viral infection. The results of this study provide solid evidence that curcumin has potent anti-EV 71 activity. Whether or not the down-regulated GBF 1 and PI 4 KB by curcumin contribute to its antiviral effect needs further studies...|$|E

40|$|Immunosuppressants {{are often}} used in the {{treatment}} of cancer. Several recent studies have shown hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation after immunosuppressive chemotherapy in HB surface antigen (HBsAg) -negative patients who were positive for antibody to HB core antigen (anti-HBc) and/or antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs). This study reports the medical course of 11 patients with blood cancer who underwent chemotherapy. All patients had at least one positive HBV marker (HBsAg, anti-HBs, and-HBc). Before immunosuppressive chemotherapy, 5 patients were treated with lamivudine and 6 had no antiviral drug treatment. None of the lamivudine treated patients had HBV reactivation, but HBV was reactivated in all of the patients not treated with this antiviral drug, one of whom had severe exacerbation of liver function and died due to hepatic failure.

40|$|Viruses have {{probably}} afflicted mankind for millennia, but modem {{factors such as}} the booming human population, fast and widespread global travel, and increased ecosystem perturbations have assured viral disease of an even brighter spotlight in the nearfuture. The examples are frightening. HlV infection is still spreading around the globe. Deadly outbreaks of viruses such as Ebola and Lassa fever continue to occur ever more closely to heavily populated regions. Drug resistant strains of familiar pathogens such as herpes simplex virus are beginning to emerge. Clearly, our science is challenged to find new treatments for these diseases. How will the next generation of <b>antiviral</b> <b>medicines</b> be discovered? A crucial component should continue to be the proven strategy of screening natural products. In the past, structurally diverse metabolites produced by terrestrial microorganisms and plants have shown inhibitory activities against various viral diseases. Unlike their terrestrial counterparts, however, the antiviral potential of secondary metabolites produced by marine organisms is virtually unexplored. This dissertation describes the discovery of novel antiviral agents produced by marine organisms. Studies involving several important viral targets are presented, and included are chemical investigations that have identified lead compounds for antiviral drug discovery. A series of linear, lipophilic peptides produced by a marine fungus are presented as novel inhibitors of the herpes simplex virus. Evidence suggests that these peptides directly inactivate the virus. Synthetic analogs of the natural substrates were prepared, leading to the development of structure-activity relationships outlining the biological importance of key structural features, and perhaps a greater insight into the possible mechanism of action. The thalassiolins, metabolites isolated from a sea grass Thalassia testudinum, were identified as inhibitors of the HlV enzyme integrase, and also the replication of HIV in cell culture. The marine cyclic peptide sansalvamide is presented as the first natural product inhibitor of the topoisomerase enzyme of the Molluscum contagiosum virus. I believe that the molecules described in this dissertation extend our knowledge and comprehension of viral inactivating agents, and further serve to support the recognition of the marine environment as a future resource for the continued discovery of novel <b>antiviral</b> <b>medicines...</b>|$|R
30|$|As one of {{the most}} {{important}} interfaces in cellular systems, biological membranes have essential functions in many activities such as cellular protection and signaling. Beyond their direct functions, they also serve as scaffolds to support the association of proteins involved in structural support, adhesion, and transport. Unfortunately, biological processes sometimes malfunction and require therapeutic intervention. For those processes which occur within or upon membranes, it is oftentimes difficult to study the mechanism in a biologically relevant, membranous environment. Therefore, the identification of direct therapeutic targets is challenging. In order to overcome this barrier, engineering strategies offer a new approach to interrogate biological activities at membrane interfaces by analyzing them through the principles of the interfacial sciences. Since membranes are complex biological interfaces, the development of simplified model systems which mimic important properties of membranes can enable fundamental characterization of interaction parameters for such processes. We have selected the hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a model viral pathogen to demonstrate how model membrane platforms can aid antiviral drug discovery and development. Responsible for generating the genomic diversity that makes treating HCV infection so difficult, viral replication represents an ideal step in the virus life cycle for therapeutic intervention. To target HCV genome replication, the interaction of viral proteins with model membrane platforms has served as a useful strategy for target identification and characterization. In this review article, we demonstrate how engineering approaches have led to the discovery of a new functional activity encoded within the HCV nonstructural 5 A protein. Specifically, its N-terminal amphipathic, α-helix (AH) can rupture lipid vesicles in a size-dependent manner. While this activity has a number of exciting biotechnology and biomedical applications, arguably the most promising one is in <b>antiviral</b> <b>medicine.</b> Based on the similarities between lipid vesicles and the lipid envelopes of virus particles, experimental findings from model membrane platforms led to the prediction that a range of medically important viruses might be susceptible to rupturing treatment with synthetic AH peptide. This hypothesis was tested and validated by molecular virology studies. Broad-spectrum antiviral activity of the AH peptide has been identified against HCV, HIV, herpes simplex virus, and dengue virus, and many more deadly pathogens. As a result, the AH peptide is the first in class of broad-spectrum, lipid envelope-rupturing antiviral agents, and has entered the drug pipeline. In summary, engineering strategies break down complex biological systems into simplified biomimetic models that recapitulate the most important parameters. This approach is particularly advantageous for membrane-associated biological processes because model membrane platforms provide more direct characterization of target interactions than is possible with other methods. Consequently, model membrane platforms hold great promise for solving important biomedical problems and speeding up the translation of biological knowledge into clinical applications.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Pharm. (Pharmacy Practice)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006 HIV/AIDS {{is already}} {{the leading cause of}} death {{worldwide}} (Unicef et al., 2004 : 10) with more than 5 million people out of a total of 46 million South Africans that were HIV positive in 2004, giving a total population prevalence rate of 11 per cent (Dorrington et al., 2004 : 1). Many people infected do not have access to even the basic drugs needed to treat HIV-related infections and other conditions (Wikipedia, 2004 : 3). The relative high price of many of the antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and diagnostics on the other hand are one of the main barriers to their availability in developing countries (Unicef et al., 2004 : 77). ARV drugs registered in South Africa include the Nucleoside/Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs), Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs) and Protease Inhibitors (PIs) (MCC, 2004 : 1). The objective of this study was to review, analyse and interpret the prescribing patterns of antiviral drugs, with special reference to antiretroviral drugs, in the private health care sector in South Africa by using a medicine claims database. A quantitative, retrospective drug utilisation review was performed. The data ranging from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2001, 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2002, and 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2004 were used, dividing each year into three four-month periods, namely January to April, May to August, and September to December. It was found that 0. 38 per cent (n= 1 475 380) for 2001, 0. 72 per cent (n= 2 076 236) for 2002, and 1. 68 per cent (n= 2 595 254) for 2004 of all studied prescriptions for the research periods 2001, 2002, and 2004 respectively, contained ARV drugs. ARV drugs constituted 0. 33 per cent (n= 2 951 326) for 2001, 0. 87 per cent (n= 4 042 145) for 2002, and 1. 92 per cent (n= 5 305 882) for 2004 of the total number of medicine items prescribed for the study years 2001, 2002 and 2004 respectively. The total cost of ARV drugs amounted to R 4 990 784. 29, thus constituting 1. 31 per cent of the total cost (R 379 708 489) of all medicine items on the database for 2001, increased to R 18 235 075. 75, thus constituting 3. 03 per cent of the total cost (R 601 350 325) of all medicine items on the database for 2002, and increased to R 34 714 483. 64, thus constituting 5. 25 per cent of the total cost (R 661 223 146) of all medicine items on the database for 2004. It was found that 35. 31 per cent (n= 5 599) for 2001, 52. 68 per cent (n= 15 004) for 2002, and 74. 27 per cent (n= 43 482) for 2004 of all studied antiviral prescriptions for the research periods 2001, 2002, and 2004 respectively, contained ARV drugs. ARV drugs constituted 46. 25 per cent (n= 21 183) for 2001, 70. 20 per cent (n= 50 246) for 2002, and 85. 87 per cent (n= 118 718) for 2004 of the total number of <b>antiviral</b> <b>medicine</b> items prescribed for the study years 2001, 2002 and 2004 respectively. The total cost of ARV medicine items, represented 67. 33 per cent (n=R 4 990 784. 29) during 2001, 84. 72 per cent (n=R 18 235 075. 75) during 2002, and 91. 20 per cent (n=R 34 714 483. 64) during 2004 of the total cost of all <b>antiviral</b> <b>medicine</b> items claimed through the database (n=R 7412577. 73 for 2001, n=R 21523365. 56 for 2002, and n=R 38 064 347. 38 for 2004). The average cost per ARV medicine items for 2004 increased from R 317. 93 i 190. 80 for the period January to April to R 369. 2 W 219. 50 for the period May to August, and decreased to R 324. 79 ± 212. 48 for the period September to December and resulted in a cost saving of R 41 044. 35 for the period May to August versus September to December for the ARV medicine items. The implementation of the pricing regulations could thus be a possible reason for this cost saving, due to fact that the single exit price only came into effect from May 2004. The weighted average number of ARV medicine items per prescription was 1. 75 * 0. 31 for 2001, increased to 2. 35 ± 0. 03 to 2002 and remained stable on 2. 35 ± 0. 02 for 2004. It was found that majority of prescriptions contained more combination ARV medicine items than single ARV medicine items, ranging from 6 834 (69. 76 per cent; n= 9 796) prescriptions containing combination ARV medicine items in 2001 and 32 941 (93. 39 per cent; n= 35 271) prescriptions containing combination ARV medicine items in 2002 to 98 805 (96. 93 per cent; n= 101 938) prescriptions containing combination ARV medicine items in 2004. Lastly, it was perceived that didanosine was the active ingredient with the largest prevalence for all three four-month periods of 2001 and also for the periods January to April and May to August of 2002, whilst efavirenz represented the active ingredient with the largest prevalence for the period September to December of 2002, and also for all three four-month periods of 2004. Didanosine represented the active ingredient with the highest total cost for the period January to April of 2001, whilst the combination of lamivudine/zidovudine represented the active ingredient with the highest total cost for the periods May to August and September to December of 2001, and also for all three-four month periods of 2002 and 2004. Nelfinavir has the highest average cost for period January to April of 2001, ritonavir for period May to August of 2001, and saquinavir mesylate for period September to December of 2001. Nelfinavir has the highest average cost for all three-four month periods of 2002, while didanosine has the highest average cost for all three four-month periods of 2004. Master...|$|E

Today, the balance between the importance of the message of prevention and the benefit for patients of being assisted in their desire for a child has tilted towards medical intervention. It would seem legitimate today to intervene in the most favourable situations rather than see these couples take the risk of spontaneous conception outside health care structures. This implies to adapt medical structure (separate laboratory, appropriate procedure, precise protocols). This approach, which is coherent from the scientific point of view, respects both the autonomy of people carrying HIV as well as the essential interest for the child, in "being" born uninfected and also has the enormous advantage of allowing access to parenthood without destroying the consistency of the message of prevention of sexual contamination.

40|$|Background: Chronic {{hepatitis}} B {{is among}} the prevalent causes of chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. The aim {{of this article is}} to discuss the indications for treatment, available drugs, and identify drug resistance or intolerance and primary treatment failure in chronic hepatitis B. Materials and Methods: A summary of epidemiology, natural course and treatment options of chronic hepatitis B is presented in this paper according to AASLD practical guidelines for treatment of hepatitis B (2009). On the basis of serum HBV DNA, alanin aminotransferase and HBe Ag level as well as the liver histological findings the natural course of chronic hepatitis B is divided into four phases: immune tolerance, immune clearance, inactive carrier state and relapse. These phases indicate the patient's immune system activation against the virus and the leading histological liver damage. Results: Patients in immune tolerance and inactive carrier state phases do not need treatment and should only be followed up while those in immune clearance and relapse phases do need treatment. Selection of PEG IFN or nucleoside analogues should be based on the presence of cirrhosis, viral load and genotype, drug resistance and also the patient's preference. Drug intolerance or resistance can lead to relapse and drug should be stopped or changed in these occasions. Conclusion: Due to the rapid increase of information about chronic hepatitis B treatment and generation of new <b>antiviral</b> <b>medicines,</b> the guidelines for treatment are changing rapidly.

40|$|Approximately 3. 2 million Americans are {{currently}} living with chronic hepatitis C, an infection {{caused by the}} hepatitis C virus. 1 Hepatitis C slowly destroys the liver over time {{and can lead to}} serious and potentially life-threatening complications, including liver cancer and the need for liver transplants. 2 In addition to serious liver damage, the complications of untreated hepatitis C can include Type 2 diabetes, rheumatologic disorders and thyroid disease. 3, 4, 5 Since the discovery of the virus in 1989, effectively treating hepatitis C has been a challenge. For years, the only available treatment options were ineffective for many patients and often difficult to tolerate. 6 Initial treatment regimens involved up to a year of weekly interferon injections and ribavirin tablets, which can cause side effects such as depression, nausea, severe reductions in certain blood cells and flu-like symptoms. 7 These often difficult-to-tolerate treatment regimens, combined with low cure rates, caused many patients to stop treatment before it was completed. 8 Significant Advances in the Treatment of Hepatitis C Gilead has led two medical breakthroughs in hepatitis C treatment in the last year: • In December 2013, the FDA approved Gilead’s Sovaldi for use in combination with other <b>antiviral</b> <b>medicines</b> for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4).

The entire test is performed in a closed system, with no exposure to infectious materials. The components are made mostly of inexpensive plastic injection molded parts, many of which can be purchased off the shelf and merely assembled. All biological waste is contained for fast, efficient disposal. This innovation was made possible because of discovery of a NASA scientists flight experiment showing the presence of VZV in saliva during high stress periods and disease.

Riordan recruited Donald Rumsfeld to join the board of directors in 1988, followed by Benno C. Schmidt, Sr., Gordon Moore, and George P. Shultz. Riordan tried to recruit Warren Buffett as an investor and board member, but was unsuccessful. Under the technical leadership of scientist Dr. Mark Matteucci, the company focused its early discovery research on making small strands of DNA (oligomers) to assess the potential of genetic code blockers (gene therapy). Its development of small molecule antiviral therapeutics began in 1991 when CEO Riordan and R&D head John C. Martin in-licensed a group of nucleotide compounds discovered in two European academic labs; one of the compounds was tenofovir, a pro-drug of which, trade named Viread, {{became one of the most}} widely used anti-retroviral drugs.|$|R
40|$|Brithvi V. Discovery of {{new drugs}} for bird-flu. Drug Discovery, 2013, 7 (18), 7 A gene {{mutation}} {{is known to}} make flu viruses resistant. Scientists have identified chemical agents that block the flu virus’s ability to replicate itself in cell culture. These novel compounds show promise for {{a new class of}} <b>antiviral</b> <b>medicines</b> to fight much-feared pandemic influenzas such as the looming “bird flu ” threats caused by the H 5 N 1 influenza A virus and the new H 7 N 9 virus responsible for a 2013 outbreak in China. Arnold and his collaborators have been working to create drugs beyond Tamiflu, especially ones that target different parts of the virus, using an approach that helped in the development of powerful anti-AIDS drugs. By synthesizing chemical compounds that bind to metal ions in a viral enzyme, the researchers found they could halt that enzyme's ability to activate a key step in the virus's replication process. Researchers Joseph Bauman and Kalyan Das first produced high-resolution images of an H 1 N 1 flu enzyme, and Bauman and postdoctoral researcher Disha Patel screened 800 small molecule fragments for binding. A research team of Chinese virologists and epidemiologists reported that they’ve discovered evidence that H 7 N 9 is directly contagious among humans, but also determined that human-to-human transmissibility of the virus is as yet non-aggressive, lessening the likelihood, at least so far, that H 7 N 9 will cause a global pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control notes that influenza viruses constantly mutate, and it’s possible that this virus could become able to easily and sustainably spread among people, triggering a global outbreak of disease (pandemic). The spread of flu becomes a pandemic when people don’t have immunity to new strains and it spreads quickly. The last pandemic occurred in 2009 with the spread of swine H 1 N 1 influenza, which originated in pigs and spread to people. Vaccine...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Genital herpes {{is one of}} {{the most}} common sexually {{transmitted}} viral diseases and the most common cause of mucous membrane ulcerations in the genital area. The number of sexually transmitted infections caused by herpes virus (HSV), especially by HSV- 1, is increasing. In the Polish population, there are no precise and current epidemiological data on herpes virus infections, especially in the anogenital area. A major problem concerns HSV infections in pregnancy, which are connected with the risk of in-utero and perinatal virus transmission. Herpes simplex virus infection in pregnancy threatens the life and health of an infant. Objective. To obtain information regarding the occurrence of herpes simplex in people of reproductive age as well as the assessment of knowledge on HSV infection and transmission, especially in pregnancy. Material and methods. Two hundred people (133 women and 67 men) aged 18 – 35 years, attending a dermatological clinic in the first half of 2014 with typical dermatological diseases, took part in the study. The subjects filled in the questionnaire including information on age, occurrence of erosions, scabs in the facial and genital area, diagnosis of oral and genital herpes virus infection, information given by the medical staff on the herpes infection, treatment with oral antivirus drugs, danger of herpes infection in pregnancy and risk of transmission of the HSV virus to fetuses and newborns. Results. Among the 200 people who took part in the study, 27 % indicated the occurrence of herpes or recurring lesions in the form of vesicles and scabs on the border of skin and mucous membranes; in 1. 5 % of them genital herpes was diagnosed. Only 12 % of investigated persons were treated with <b>antiviral</b> <b>medicines.</b> Sixty-eight percent of subjects stated that HSV is an infectious disease, 16 % claimed that it is non-infectious, and a similar number did not know if it is an infectious disease or not. Only half of the studied group answered that it is dangerous for pregnant women and newborns, and 86 % had never received sufficient information on herpes virus infection from medical staff. Conclusions. Our results confirm the lack of sufficient knowledge on HSV infection, especially in pregnancy, and the necessity of educating patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} {{scene in}} 2008 – 2009 In times of economic crisis {{the supply of}} medicines is often the first component of the health-care budget to be cut. Since January 2009 the World Health Organization (WHO) has been monitoring the health impact of the economic crisis through quarterly reports of medicine consumption and prices in over 80 countries. These data are collected by the Essential Medicines and Pharmaceutical Policies Department (EMP) in collaboration with IMS Health. EMP has also contributed to mitigating {{the effects of the}} H 1 N 1 pandemic. EMP was actively involved {{in the development of the}} clinical guidelines for the treatment of H 1 N 1 influenza; a monitoring tool (PaniFlow) was developed in cooperation with Swiss regulators to monitor adverse events following immunization or the use of medicines; and key <b>antiviral</b> <b>medicines</b> were prequalified, thereby increasing competition and supplier security, and reducing the price of these medicines for low- and middle-income countries by half. The positive effects of the merger of the two WHO medicines departments and the move of EMP to the Health Systems and Services Cluster have become increasingly apparent. The three functions of EMP (global normative work, technical support to countries and innovative public health thinking) are now fully integrated. In addition to the ongoing collaboration between the medicines programmes at headquarters, regional and country offices, several cluster-wide projects have started, such as the development of performance indicators for renewed Primary Health Care. Meanwhile, international interest in the quality and regulation of medicines has never been so great. In addition to its continuing role in the development of new medicine quality standards and prequalification of large numbers of new products for UN procurement, WHO is now involved, together with several international donors, in a new initiative to promote regional harmonization of medicine regulatory systems within and between African regional economic communities. Many years of successful collaboration with other UN agencies active in pharmaceutical support have resulted in a situation where all agencies increasingly speak with one voice – a practical example of the concept of “One UN”...|$|R
40|$|We {{summarized}} {{the flow of}} our research {{on the development of}} <b>antiviral</b> traditional <b>medicines,</b> which was a collaboration with the late Professor Tsuneo Namba. Even if traditional medicines and compounds purified from them have strong antiviral activity in vitro, we believe they are just inhibitors and not medicines if they have no therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Therefore our study is based on the confirmation of the oral therapeutic efficacy with traditional dosages in humans. We first screened the in vitro-antiviral activity of typically and easily available traditional medicines that are currently used for the treatment of various chronic diseases in China, India and Japan. Then we selected the extracts of traditional medicines with prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral activity in animal infection models. By verifying the antiviral activity of extracts in vivo, their new indications for the use of viral infection would be established. In consequence, the drinking of the extracts of traditional medicines like a daily tea or coffee may be used as prophylaxis and therapy for diseases caused by viral infection and improve the quality of life. Here, we describe how the antiviral extracts of traditional medicines and active compounds involved in them were explored and characterized, based on a view that antiviral activity should be active in vivo...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesHepatitis C {{therapy in}} Brazil is {{expensive}} {{due to the}} cost of antiviral drugs and demands on medical resources. The objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the direct costs per patient of chronic hepatitis C therapy in a Brazilian setting. MethodA microcosting study from a public health system perspective. The costs included were those of <b>antiviral</b> drugs, secondary <b>medicines,</b> diagnostic tests, visits to physicians and other professionals, hospitalization, nurse, and pharmaceutical care. All costs were priced in 2010. The values were converted to US $ (2010). ResultsThe total direct cost of hepatitis C treatment per patient with interferon alpha (IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) was US $ 982. 25, with peginterferon alpha (PEG) 2 a 180 μg plus RBV was US $ 10, 658. 08, and with PEG 2 b 120 μg plus RBV was US $ 12, 597. 63, taking into account entire treatment according to Brazilian guidelines and assuming that all patients completed full treatment. The antiviral drugs are the most expensive element of the cost of treatment, totaling more than 40 % of the medical costs of IFN plus RBV therapy and more than 88 % of PEG plus RBV therapy. Calculating an average of 10, 000 treatments per year, the total direct cost is US $ 90, 346, 772. 39. According to the Ministry of Health, 90 % of the annual total cost of hepatitis C treatment is accounted for by antiviral drugs. ConclusionsIn Brazil, antiviral drugs are the most expensive component of hepatitis C treatment. The cost of follow-up and support to patients is minimal compared with the cost of antiviral drugs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHighly active {{antiretroviral}} therapy (HAART) {{has been}} successful in reducing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) - 1 -associated morbidity and mortality since its introduction in 1996. However, it fails to eradicate HIV- 1 infection. The high cost of life-long highly active antiretroviral therapy and the emergence of drug resistance among HIV- 1 -infected individuals have brought renewed pressure for the discovery of novel <b>antivirals</b> and alternative <b>medicines.</b> Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a complementary and alternative medicine, and serves as a rich resource for new drug development. Despite the almost 100 plant-derived compounds that are in clinical trials, few target HIV- 1 infection. In this study, we discovered that Sanguisorba officinalis extract (SOE) has anti-HIV- 1 properties. Using a cell-based assay and single-cycle luciferase reporter viruses pseudotyped with envelopes from HIV- 1 or control viruses, we found that SOE exhibited significant inhibitory ability against both CCR 5 and CXCR 4 tropic HIV- 1 (ADA and HXB 2), with respective IC 50 values of 1. 91  ±  0. 16  μg/mL and 3. 70  ±  0. 53  μg/mL. SOE also inhibited simian immunodeficiency virus infection but failed to block vesicular stomatitis virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and influenza H 5 N 1 pseudoviruses. Furthermore, we showed that SOE had no effect on postentry events of HIV- 1 replication. Because SOE pretreatment with the virus but not with cell lines expressing viral receptors showed the maximal inhibitory activity, we can state that SOE probably blocks entry by acting on the viral envelope directly. In addition, SOE was able to inhibit reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistant viruses (K 103 N, Y 188 L, and K 103 N/Y 188 L/G 190 A) and a protease inhibitor resistant strain (PI- 2840). Our findings demonstrate SOE as a novel and specific entry inhibitor, which sheds light on the discovery of anti-HIV- 1 drugs from traditional herbal medicines...|$|R
