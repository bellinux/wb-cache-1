40|$|Shorrocks {{suggested}} a broad welfare dominance relationship using {{the properties of}} Pigou-Dalton and Pareto to provide a partial ranking of income distributions. This paper considers a family of <b>alternative</b> <b>dominance</b> relationships generalizing Shorrocks's approach. The Pareto property, which states that welfare will not diminish if the income of any individual increases, holding other incomes constant, is replaced by the property that welfare will not diminish if the growth in income is shared by all the poorer sectors of the society. Implications of these alternatives are explored. Using data from the People's Republic of China, we show how the family of dominance relationships proposed in this paper {{can be used to}} examine real-world welfare changes.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze {{phytoplankton}} development in the absence of grazing pressure in the Duas Bocas Reservoir (DBR). The DBR is located in the Duas Bocas Bio-logical Reserve and supplies some of the water demand of Great Vitória, Espírito Santo State. On September 25, 2008, 40 L of water were collected below the water’s surface, from the lacustrine region of the reservoir. In the laboratory, six microcosms were established (glass boxes), each with a six-liter volume of water, and were maintained for seven days. Three microcosms served as controls (C). In the other three microcosms, zooplankton was removed by water filtration in a plankton net with a 60 -μm mesh size. A positive trend in cyanobacteria and chlorophyte growth was found in the absence of grazing. Cyanobacte-ria benefited under herbivore feeding pressure (Controls) to the detriment of chlorophytes. However, in the absence of grazing pressure, the competition between these groups was sometimes higher, resulting in an <b>alternative</b> <b>dominance.</b> The chlorophyte Monoraphidium griffithii was dominant in both microcosms. Chlorella vulgaris was abundant, and the cyano-bacteria Limnothrix bicudoi and Synechocystis sp. were abundant in both microcosms.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a dominance intensity measuring method to derive a ranking of alternatives {{to deal with}} incomplete information in multi-criteria decision-making problems {{on the basis of}} multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) and fuzzy sets theory. We consider the situation where there is imprecision concerning decision-makers’ preferences, and imprecise weights are represented by trapezoidal fuzzy weights. The proposed method is based on the dominance values between pairs of alternatives. These values can be computed by linear programming, as an additive multi-attribute utility model is used to rate the <b>alternatives.</b> <b>Dominance</b> values are then transformed into dominance intensity measures, used to rank the alternatives under consideration. Distances between fuzzy numbers based on the generalization of the left and right fuzzy numbers are utilized to account for fuzzy weights.

Recently, it has been pointed out in some studies that Pareto dominance-based algorithms do not always work well on multiobjective problems with many objectives. Scalarizing function-based fitness evaluation is a promising <b>alternative</b> to Pareto <b>dominance</b> especially for the case of many objectives. A representative scalarizing function-based algorithm is MOEA/D (multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition) of Zhang & Li (2007).

For example, both the weighted Tchebycheff (Chebyshev) and the weighted sum are used for fitness evaluation. We examine two methods for implementing our idea.

40|$|When a {{decision}} analyst 2 ̆ 7 s {{goal is to}} establish a partial ordering of <b>alternatives</b> through <b>dominance</b> tests, then these dominance tests should incorporate ambiguities about outcomes and their likelihood {{in a manner consistent with}} the expressions of those providing information. Ambiguity is present, when, for example, one is provided with vague beliefs about how the future is expected to unfold, or imprecise specifications of the consequences of various actions. In general, ambiguity is a condition associated with the non-uniqueness of information caused by the existence of one-to-many, or more generally, many-to-many relations. This condition is prevalent in decision making, since we may have situations which associate one or many probabilities with one or many outcomes. ^ This research addresses the following challenges: (1) Clarifying and representing beliefs about likelihood and outcomes as they are provided by sources. These representations of ambiguity utilize, but are not limited to, point representations, set representations (c. f. Dempster-Shafer theory), interval representations, and combinations of these. (2) Modifying and extending the stochastic dominance and mean-variance tests so that they may be useful when outcomes and probabilities are ambiguously described. This involves proposing and proving more general versions of the stochastic dominance theorems, developing foundational results in nonlinear programming, and developing accompanying models and procedures for determining mean-variance bounds. These extensions augment and complement sensitivity analysis, the traditional tool utilized for considering additional uncertainty in decision analysis. It can be shown that typical approaches to sensitivity analysis will not always yield the extreme values of the variance measures. ^ The usefulness of the research is evident as one notes the widespread use of stochastic dominance and mean-risk tests and yet recognizes that decision-making under ambiguity is a prevalent condition. Decision makers who use such tests could pursue the task of ranking alternatives while explicitly recognizing existing ambiguities. Extending stochastic dominance theorems and mean-risk theorems provide valuable techniques to pare down the number of alternatives considered without burdening the decision maker to provide more information or express utilities or preferences for ambiguities. ...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{investigates the}} problem of testing for {{stochastic}} dominance which is a basic concept of decision theory. We focus on stochastic dominance of first and of second degree which {{are the most important}} stochastic dominance decision rules. These decision rules are applied in various branches of economics, e. g. finance and social welfare theory. Statistical tests for stochastic dominance are based on the difference of the empirical distribution or quantile functions. For the determination of the critical region we need the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis. In many tests contemporaneous and serial independence are assumed. However, in many applications the observations do not satisfy these constraints. In particular, financial data usually feature positive correlation between the observations of different samples {{at the same time and}} conditional heteroskedasticity within each sample. We confine ourselves to bivariate GARCH (1, 1) which has good fit and forecast properties for financial data. In order to get an idea about the impact of conditional heteroskedasticity on statistical tests we analyze its effect on common statistical procedures for means and variances. It turns out that the effect on procedures for variances is tremendous. The main issue of this thesis is the development of tests for stochastic dominance which are robust to these time series properties. Two kinds of tests are considered: on the one hand tests in which dominance is the hypothesis, on the other hand tests with the <b>alternative</b> of <b>dominance.</b> Most of the tests known from literature are not robust to conditional heteroskedasticity. We develop two tests for the first test problem and one test for the second test problem which can be used under the assumption that the underlying processes are strongly mixing. Theoretical analysis and simulations show that the tests using circular subsampling, block permutation and truncation, respectively, have good size and power properties even if conditional heteroskedasticity is prevalent in the data.

40|$|The gai {{mutation}} of Arabidopsis confers a dwarf phenotype resembling that of mutants defective in gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis. However, gai mutant plants {{differ from}} GA biosynthesis mutants because {{they fail to}} respond to exogenous GAs and accumulate endogenous GA species to higher (rather than lower) levels than found in wild-type controls. The gai mutation, therefore, identifies a gene that modulates the response of plant cells to GA. We have mapped gai with respect to visible and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) markers from chromosome 1. To observe the phenotype exhibited by individuals potentially lacking wild-type (GAI) function, we have also isolated novel irradiation-induced derivative alleles of gai. When homozygous, these alleles confer a revertant phenotype that is indistinguishable from the wild type. gai is a semidominant mutation that exerts its effects either because it is a gain-of-function mutation or because it is a loss-of-function or reduced-function mutation. The genetic and physiological properties of the derivative alleles are considered with reference to these <b>alternative</b> modes of <b>dominance</b> of gai.

40|$|AbstractSince Yager first {{presented}} the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator to aggregate multiple input arguments, {{it has received}} much attention from the fields of decision science and computer science. A critical issue when selecting an OWA operator is {{the determination of the}} associated weights. For this reason, numerous weight generating methods, including rogramming-based approaches, have appeared in the literature. In this paper, we develop a general method for obtaining OWA operator weights via an extreme point approach. The extreme points are represented by the intersection of an attitudinal character constraint and a fundamental ordered weight simplex. The extreme points are completely identified using the proposed formula, and the OWA operator weights can then be expressed by a convex combination of the identified extreme points. With those identified extreme points, some new OWA operator weights can be generated by a centroid or a user-directed method, which reflects the decision-maker’s incomplete preferences. This line of reasoning is further extended to encompass situations in which the attitudinal character is specified in the form of interval with an aim to relieve the burden of specifying the precise attitudinal character, thus obtaining less-specific expressions that render human judgments readily available. All extreme points corresponding to the uncertain attitudinal character are also obtained by a proposed formula and then used to prioritize the multitude of <b>alternatives.</b> Meanwhile, two <b>dominance</b> rules are effectively used for prioritization of alternatives...|$|R

The Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) benchmarking process is an efficient model to measure compliance which contributes to harmonising future food safety standards. While GFSI attempts to harmonise retail standards are commendable and elegant in principle, in practice, retailers continue to support their own standards. It is difficult to see retailers giving up on their own standards and the control they currently exert as chain captains. Although there are advantages in harmonising the standards and reducing certification costs, there is a need to ensure inspection costs are competitive. There is also the risk that too much harmonisation will result in private standards losing their individuality and uniqueness.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers stimulus-based {{influences on}} consumer decision-making. Context effects, {{referred to as}} set configuration effects in this dissertation, have repeatedly been shown to influence choices consumers make. For example, the choice probability of an alternative increases when a similar, but inferior alternative is added to a set originally containing two alternatives. Studies examining set configuration effects have generally been conducted using simple choice tasks; that is choice sets with few attributes and alternatives. Some authors have argued that {{increasing the number of}} alternatives and attributes, a more complex task, should reduce the probability of set configuration effects. Very few studies have utilized complex tasks to empirically test this assumption. Hence, the extent to which choice set configurations influence choice in complex tasks (i. e. more alternatives and attributes) has not been sufficiently examined. This thesis considers choice set configuration effects among consumers presented with complex choice tasks. Five experiments were created to test the influence of set configurations on choice in more complex choice tasks than typically researched. Across these experiments, two set configurations were examined; uniqueness and asymmetric dominance. Uniqueness denotes a set configuration in which a single alternative is unique on an important attribute among heterogeneous competitor <b>alternatives.</b> Asymmetric <b>dominance</b> is a set configuration in which an alternative that is similar, but inferior, to another alternative is added to the set. Findings from several experiments indicate that these set configurations, uniqueness and asymmetric dominance, can increase choice of a target alternative in complex tasks. A second key finding from this study is that asymmetric dominance can influence choice directly, as just discussed, and at a secondary level, or step. That is, an asymmetric dominance relationship among non-considered alternatives can influence choice among considered alternatives. To my knowledge, this type of secondary level set configuration effect has not been observed in the literature. Secondary level set configuration effects were moderated by task complexity (simple vs. complex) and product involvement (high vs. low) : secondary level effects were observed in higher involving, complex tasks. I argue that salience of an asymmetric dominance relationship leads to a comparison of considered alternatives to a non-considered, yet good alternative. This comparison can help consumers discriminate among the considered alternatives. Findings lend support to this suggested mechanism for secondary level set configuration effects. nhhph...|$|R
