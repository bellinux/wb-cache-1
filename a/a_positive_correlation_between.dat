5|$|People {{may simply}} like most {{what they see}} most. Letters that appear more {{frequently}} in everyday usage also occur more often in people's names. Forer, in 1940, and Alluisi and Adams, in 1962, found <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> the frequency of occurrence of letters and phonemes and how attractive they were judged to be. Zajonc extended these studies, using foreign symbols and controlling the number of exposures. This led him to formulate the mere-exposure hypothesis: the more you see something, the more you like it. Nuttin's original study showed that mere exposure {{can not be the}} cause of the name-letter effect, as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had the letter in their names and those who did not. He also found that whereas the letter B is of low frequency in French and the letter Q of medium frequency, in experiments with French speakers the B was among the most highly liked letters and the Q was among the least liked. Similarly, in Polish the Y is a medium frequency letter, yet was still among the least preferred letters. In each of the languages, the least frequent letters were over-represented in the set of least preferred letters, whereas the most preferred letters were rarely the highest frequency letters. The exposure counts in the lab studies done by Zajonc (20 to 25 times) were minuscule compared to real-life observation counts of any letter, which also caused Nuttin to cast doubt on whether Zajonc's theory could hold true in the real world.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the tadpole phase, {{hind legs}} appear, {{followed}} by front limbs, and the phase ends when the front limbs are developed. This normally occurs between October and April due to the breeding season, but tadpoles been observed in the wild throughout the year, suggesting some tadpoles overwinter; this has been seen to occur for captive tadpoles. The length of the tadpole stage, in the wild and in captivity, is usually between 10 and 12 weeks, but can range from five weeks to a year. The slower-growing tadpoles usually progress during winter, as there is <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> growth rates and temperatures. Variation in growth rate across pH values of 4, 7 and 9 was insignificant. In the first four weeks, there was no significant dependence of the growth rate across the 18–26°C range, but from this point on, growth was significantly hindered at 18°C. At the beginning of the metamorphing stage, all limbs are present and developed, along with a tail. During this phase, the tail is resorbed, and the only other visible change is the spiracle closing. Metamorphing tadpoles typically have a SVL of 22–28mm, and will complete metamorphosis between two and 11 months, depending on the temperature of the water and available food. The process is slowed at low temperatures, but generally takes between three and eight days after the tadpole stage is complete. Breeding occurs in a significantly higher proportion of sites where no predatory fish are present, and water bodies are ephemeral rather than permanent. Populations in Victoria, however, have been recorded as breeding in permanent ponds as readily as they do in ephemeral ponds.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, the neuroendocrine {{system in}} adult males, which {{controls}} their mating behavior, must be stimulated before they will mate with a female. Protein {{in the male}} diet is not necessarily needed for this stimulation, but higher percentages of females were successfully inseminated by male specimens which had been fed either dung or beef liver versus specimens with a diet of only sugar. Protein is not generally necessary for spermatogenesis in male flies, but it is paramount for accessory reproductive gland development, higher rates of copulation, and the capability of impregnating females. An additional study found <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> male head size {{and the size of}} the aedeagi (the external reproductive organs), which has been suggested as a possible reason for lower percentages of insemination between small males and large females within this species.|$|E
25|$|Some spiders, such as Pholcus phalangioides, will prey {{on their}} own kind when food is scarce. Also, females of Phidippus johnsoni have been {{observed}} carrying dead males in their fangs. This behavior may be triggered by aggression, where females carry over hostility from their juvenile state and consume males just as they would prey. Sih and Johnson surmise that non-reproductive cannibalism can occur due to a remnant of an aggression trait in juvenile females. Known as the “aggressive spillover hypothesis,” this tendency unselectively to attack anything that moves is cultivated by <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> hostility, foraging capability, and fecundity. Aggression {{at a young age}} leads to an increase in prey consumption and as such, a larger adult size. This behavior “spills over” into adulthood, and shows up as a nonadaptive trait that manifests itself through adult females preying on males of their same species.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> {{minorities}} and a socio economic status of being low income in industrialized and rural {{regions of the}} U.S. depict how low income communities tend to include more individuals that have a lower educational background, most importantly in health. Income status, diet, and education all construct a higher burden for low income minorities, to be conscious about their health. Research conducted by medical departments at universities in San diego, Miami, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina suggested that minorities in regions where lower socioeconomic status is common, there was a direct relationship with unhealthy diets and greater distance of supermarkets. Therefore, in areas where supermarkets are less accessible (food deserts) to impoverished areas, the more likely these groups are to purchase inexpensive fast food or just follow an unhealthy diet. As a result, because food deserts are more prevalent in low income communities, minorities that reside in these areas are more prone obesity, {{which can lead to}} diseases such as chronic kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes.|$|E

25|$|In general, the {{molecular}} pathomechanism of ACHM is either {{the inability to}} properly control or respond to altered levels of cGMP. cGMP is particularly important in visual perception as its level controls the opening of cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels (CNGs). Decreasing the concentration of cGMP results in closure of CNGs and resulting hyperpolarization and cessation of glutamate release. Native retinal CNGs are composed of 2 α- and 2 β-subunits, which are CNGA3 and CNGB3, respectively, in cone cells. When expressed alone, CNGB3 cannot produce functional channels, whereas {{this is not the}} case for CNGA3. Coassembly of CNGA3 and CNGB3 produces channels with altered membrane expression, ion permeability (Na+ vs. K+ and Ca2+), relative efficacy of cAMP/cGMP activation, decreased outward rectification, current flickering, and sensitivity to block by L-cis-diltiazem. Mutations tend to result in the loss of CNGB3 function or gain of function (often increased affinity for cGMP) of CNGA3. cGMP levels are controlled by the activity of the cone cell transducin, GNAT2. Mutations in GNAT2 tend to result in a truncated and, presumably, non-functional protein, thereby preventing alteration of cGMP levels by photons. There is <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>correlation</b> <b>between</b> the severity of mutations in these proteins and the completeness of the achromatopsia phenotype.|$|E

30|$|The strongest ZIP code-level {{correlations}} {{discovered in}} this study were found for smaller ZIP codes (population below the national ZIP code average).

This result, along with several weaker <b>correlations</b> we found <b>between</b> home price/rent and appreciation, agrees with our expectation that appreciation is higher near larger institutions.
