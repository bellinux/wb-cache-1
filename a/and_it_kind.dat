500|$|After {{taking a}} break from touring in {{promotion}} of the band's fourth album Insomniac (1995), Green Day recorded the more experimental Nimrod (1997). The record, which delved into a more wide variety of genres including folk, ska, and surf rock, featured the unprecedented acoustic hit [...] "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)". [...] Vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong recalled that the song's stylistic departure from the group's earlier work made him anxious about the song's release: [...] "I was scared for that song to come out...because it was such a vulnerable song, to put that song out and it was like which way will it end up going? [...] It was really exciting <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>kind</b> of sparked more in us as songwriters to expand on that." ...|$|E

Susan and Paul are enemies, {{but they have a}} [...] "grudging respect or {{interest}} in each other". Paul has a shady past and Karl does not trust Paul, so Susan uses her new job to wind Karl up. Susan works closely with Paul and his reputation with the ladies gives Woodburne the opportunity to bring Susan's sadistic side. Woodburne has said that she wishes for more of that storyline as she and Dennis found it [...] "fun". She added that [...] "There was a lot of conflict and comedy <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>kind</b> of ran its natural course over several weeks. She still works there so the potential for further stories is still there." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Gorilla" [...] was {{the first}} song written for the album, setting [...] "the tone for the entire project <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>kind</b> of became the mascot". This was the reason behind the gorilla {{on the cover of}} the album, as Mars {{explained}} in an interview with MTV News. In another interview, this time for GQ magazine, Mars revealed the song's conception, saying that [...] "it was just painting a picture—some animalistic sex". When asked about what the meaning is for [...] "making love like a gorilla"?, Mars replied aggressively [...] "What does that sound like to you? Come on...What is this, 1933? We can't talk about this?". Regarding the line [...] "I got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker", Mars said that his inspiration came [...] "just because the room was dark" [...] and he felt like Johnny Cash.|$|E

500|$|Breakaways {{critical}} acclaim also enabled Clarkson to also earn critical respect, {{particularly from the}} rock and indie music scene, who had looked down upon American Idol contestants. In his memoir, Davis recalled a meeting with Simon Fuller and Sony BMG President Charles Goldstuck, where Fuller acknowledged how the worldwide success of Breakaway had validated American Idol itself. The popularity of [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] among the rock community also resulted in various cover versions by rock acts, such as A Day to Remember, Ted Leo, and Tokyo Police Club. Clarkson herself recalled, [...] "It's ridiculous how well that song was received by hard rockers, by indie people. I was walking around {{with a friend of}} mine and this hard-rock guy {{came up to me and}} was like, 'I look stupid, but I tell my friends I love this song.' People at concerts are like, 'That's my guilty pleasure. I don't mean to be mean, but I didn't want to like the American Idol girl.' But they love that song, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>kind</b> of won them over." ...|$|E
500|$|M.I.A. views {{her work}} as reflective, pieced {{together}} in one piece [...] "so you can acquire it and hear it." [...] She states, [...] "All that information floats around where we are – the images, the opinions, the discussions, the feelings – they all exist, and I felt someone {{had to do something}} about it because I can't live in this world where we pretend nothing really matters." [...] On the political nature of her songs she has said, [...] "Nobody wants to be dancing to political songs. Every bit of music out there that’s making it into the mainstream is really about nothing. I wanted to see if I could write songs about something important and make it sound like nothing. <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>kind</b> of worked." [...] Censorship on MTV of [...] "Sunshowers" [...] proved controversial and was again criticised following Kala release [...] "Paper Planes". YouTube's block and subsequent age gating/obscuring of the video for [...] "Born Free" [...] from Maya due to its graphic violence/political subtext was criticised by M.I.A. as hypocritical, citing the Internet channel's streaming of real-life killings. She went on to state, ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the first}} years of her career, Carey's musical styles mainly {{involved}} pop influenced R. Additionally, her image was of a reserved and modestly dressed female, or as Carey's later described it [...] "the 90s version of Mary Poppins". As the 1990s wore on, Carey began featuring rappers on remixes, and began infusing hip-hop into her musical palette. As her music changed, so too did her image, which became more sexual, and aimed at younger audiences than the more contemporary appeal of her earlier works. According to Michael Paoletta from Billboard, [...] "Through the Rain" [...] was used not only as a vehicle for listeners to become more in-tune with Carey's personal struggles, but also as a means to [...] "re-capture" [...] her audience throughout the earlier stages of her career. A contemporary and pop ballad, he felt the song would find [...] "much embrace" [...] from her older fans, while her audience that grew accustomed to her hip-hop flavored music would feel [...] "lost and abandoned". In an interview with MTV News, the song's co-producer Jimmy Jam described why Carey chose to release it as the lead single: [...] "I think 'Through the Rain' {{is a great way to}} start the record, because it is emotional <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>kind</b> of speaks directly to the questions people might have about the last year of her life. It's a good idea to get that out of the way and move on to happy, less emotional songs." ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{stated that}} there haven't been many {{lighting}} challenges, although Albuquerque's clouds are [...] "very choppy" [...] and {{can go from}} shadow to sunlight in a single take. For interiors, Grillo often uses a particular photograph by Robert Frank: [...] "It's shot in a dive bar where there are really hot windows <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> <b>kind</b> of smoky". Grillo continues by adding, [...] "There's smoke, sunlight coming through the windows, {{and you can see}} the shafts of light <b>and</b> <b>it’s</b> <b>kind</b> of burned out and contrasty. Sometimes an image stays in your head <b>and</b> you apply <b>it</b> to your work. There are two or three sets that I light this way." ...|$|R

500|$|Kurt and Blaine's duet on [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside" [...] {{received}} many more reviews {{than the other}} songs, and the greatest praise. Wieselman called it his [...] "far and away favorite" [...] song of the episode. Stack declared it the [...] "complete and total highlight of the episode {{and one of the}} best moments of the second season". He gave it an [...] "A+". Hankinson said it was the show's [...] "best musical number", and described it as [...] "well-performed, sweet and wonderfully choreographed"; he added: [...] "It was bold, without being gimmicky". The Atlantic Meghan Brown and Patrick Burns were both enthusiastic: Brown said [...] "Kurt's sweetly sexy duet with Blaine was near-perfect" [...] and [...] "the vocals and choreography gave Chris Colfer and Darren Criss a real chance to shine", while Burns called it [...] "adorable". Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone wrote that it was [...] "full of sweet harmonies and has an ideal undercurrent of romantic tension", though Harper [...] "wasn't feeling any chemistry between them"; she felt the performance was [...] "a little overacted", but noted that [...] "their voices seem to like each other". Benigno was also less enthusiastic; he gave the song a [...] "B−" [...] and felt there was [...] "something missing" [...] from the rendition: [...] "these two could have sang this number in their sleep <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>kind</b> of sounds like they did".|$|E
2500|$|The Cars {{featured}} {{a large amount}} of technology on many of its tracks, due to the band's appreciation for new equipment. David Robinson said, [...] "We'd always get the latest stuff from music stores even if it would be obsolete in two months. It reached the point where I'd have 10 or 12 foot switches to hit during a short set." [...] The album also is notable for front-man Ric Ocasek's use of irony and sarcasm. Keyboardist Greg Hawkes said, [...] "There was definitely a little self-conscious irony in there. We started out wanting to be electric and straight-ahead rock, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>kind</b> of turned into an artier kind of thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{arrival of}} the Butcher family in May 1988 {{signified}} an {{end of an era}} for the soap, as Den and Angie Watts (Leslie Grantham and Anita Dobson) vacated their positions as landlord and landlady of The Queen Victoria public house, leaving Frank (Mike Reid), and his girlfriend Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement) to take over tenancy. Ricky (Sid Owen) and Diane, played by Sophie Lawrence, Frank's teenage children came with Frank. Lawrence was 15 at the time, and she got the part in EastEnders straight after leaving stage school. Lawrence has commented, [...] "I always just thought that I would be a dancer and go into a West End musical and that I would be very, very happy. Then I got EastEnders when I was 15 <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>kind</b> of changed my life." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Every {{generation}} writes its own history," [...] said Kenneth T. Jackson, {{a historian}} of New York City. [...] "It {{could be that}} The Power Broker was a reflection of its time: New York was in trouble and had been in decline for 15 years. Now, for {{a whole host of}} reasons, New York is entering a new time, a time of optimism, growth and revival that hasn't been seen in half a century. And that causes us to look at our infrastructure,” said Jackson. “A lot of big projects are on the table again, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>kind</b> of suggests a Moses era without Moses," [...] he added. Politicians are also reconsidering the Moses legacy; in a 2006 speech to the Regional Plan Association on downstate transportation needs, New York governor-elect Eliot Spitzer stated a biography of Moses written today might be called At Least He Got It Built: [...] "That's what we need today. A real commitment to get things done." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1968 Corea read Dianetics, Hubbard's most {{well known}} {{self-help}} book, {{and in the}} early 1970s developed an interest in Hubbard's science fiction novels.

He did many, many things. He was a true Renaissance Man." [...] Corea said that Scientology became a profound influence on his musical direction in the early 1970s: [...] "I no longer wanted to satisfy myself. I really want to connect with the world and make my music mean something to people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taking {{their name}} from the David Bowie song with the same title, Pritchard {{revealed}} the first song they ever played as a group was a cover version of The Strokes' song [...] "Reptilia". The Kooks recorded an EP demo, sending it out in search of gigs; they instead received offers from managers and record companies. The band had only been together as a group for four months when they signed with Virgin Records, after being spotted by several label scouts at the Brighton Free Butt Festival in 2005. In an interview with musicOMH, Pritchard revealed [...] "It was really quick how it all happened, we did a demo with a mate of ours in London, which we sent off to one guy to get some gigs, and {{he turned out to}} be a manager. He rung us up <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>kind</b> of went from there." [...] The members of the band have since revealed that they felt they weren’t ready at the time, [...] "We were way too early to sign a record deal ... We were really young, we'd been together like two or three months, so we really didn't want to sign. But then we thought it's a really good opportunity and Virgin seemed like really cool people - they just seemed to really understand where we were coming from.," [...] said Pritchard, who has also complimented the space the record label allowed for the band to grow, [...] "They were patient with us and let us develop our style, whatever it was." ...|$|E
