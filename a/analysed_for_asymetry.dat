30|$|There is however an {{asymmetry}} in this process. On average, individuals {{report a}} larger gain in well-being when returning to work than the loss they report when losing it. A possible explanation <b>for</b> this <b>asymetry</b> is {{the existence of}} anticipation and adaptation effects, an approach taken in Hanglberger and Merz (2011), who find large and negative anticipation effects of losing a job. When {{looking at the same}} transitional matrix decomposed by gender, we find that men report higher drops and peaks than women. Transitions from unemployment to employment provide men with a 1.6 jump in SWB compared to a 1.15 for women. When they lose their job, men report a drop of 1.15 points compared to a 1 point drop for women. The transition from self-employment to employment gives much greater rewards to women (0.4 points more) than to men (0.1).|$|R
