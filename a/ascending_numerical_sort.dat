Accuracy and latency of responding revealed distance and magnitude effects analogous to previous findings with human participants (R. S. Moyer & T. K. Landaeur. 1967). Collectively these studies show that monkeys represent the numerosities 1 - 9 on at least an ordinal scale. It is often assumed that numerical thought is beyond the reach of animals because all human numerical systems use arbitrary symbols, (e. g., Hurford, 1987).

40|$|Kimberlite pipes or dykes tend {{to occur}} in {{clusters}} (a few kilometres in diameter) within fields 30 – 50 km in diameter. They are generally considered to originate from low degrees of partial melting of car-bonated peridotite within zones of <b>ascending</b> mantle. <b>Numerical</b> modelling shows that at the depth of formation of kimberlite melts (200 km), mantle compaction processes can result in the forma-tion of melt pockets a few tens of kilometres across, with melt concentrations up to 7 %. The initiation of swarms of kimberlite dykes {{at the top of}} these melt pockets is inevitable because of the large excess pressure between the melt and the surrounding solid, which exceeds the hydraulic fracturing limit of the overlying rocks. After their initiation at mantle depth the swarm of dykes may reach the surface of the Earth when the entire cratonic lithosphere column is in extension. We propose that kimberlite fields represent the surface envelope of dyke swarms generated inside a melt pocket and that kimberlite clusters represent the discharge of melt via dykes originat-ing from sub-regions of the pocket. This model reproduces the worldwide average diameter of kimberlite fields and is consistent with the observation that some of the main kimberlite fields display age ranges of c. 10 Myr. It is deduced that, at the scale of the Kaapvaal craton, different fields such as Kimberley, N. Lesotho and Orapa, dated at 80 – 90 Ma, probably result from synchronous melt pockets forming inside an ascending mantle flow. The same model could apply to the fields of the Rietfontein, Central Cape and Gibeon districts dated at 60 – 70 Ma. It is suggested that the same mantle flow that produced the Kimberley, N.

At {{the end of the}} 19 th century Herman Hollerith combined punch cards having holes in specific places – a device known from mechanic musical instruments – with the cognitive concept of coding numbers by the arrangement of holes on the cards. In mechanic musical instruments, this technique was used for coding musical notes. Air pressure passing through the holes of the punch cards triggered an acoustic tone in pipes, strings or bells associated with the holes. Hollerith not only replaced musical notes by numbers. He also combined his punch cards with an electric reading device replacing air pressure: spring-mounted needles made an electrical connection when passing through the holes. Taken in isolation, all of the elements which Hollerith combined were no new concepts, yet their combination was.

Similarly, set L 0 (S) = S, and for i ≥ 1, define Li(S) : = L(Li− 1 (S)). These constructions define two finite <b>ascending</b> chains of <b>numerical</b> semigroups S = B 0 (S) ⊆ B 1 (S) ⊆ · · · ⊆ Bβ(S) (S) = N 0 and S = L 0 (S) ⊆ L 1 (S) ⊆ · · · ⊆ Lλ(S) (S) = N 0.

MCDA {{consists of a}} set of principles and tools to assist a decision maker (DM) to solve a decision problem with a finite set of alternatives compared according to two or more criteria, which are usually conflicting. The three types of classification problems to which original research contributions are made are Screening: Reduce a large set of alternatives to a smaller set that most likely contains the best choice. Sorting: Arrange the alternatives into a few groups in preference order, so that the DM can manage them more effectively. Nominal classification: Assign alternatives to nominal groups structured by the DM, so that the number of groups, and the characteristics of each group, seem appropriate to the DM. Research on screening is divided into two parts: the design of a sequential screening procedure that is then applied to water resource planning in the Region of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada; {{and the development of a}} case-based distance method for screening that is then demonstrated using a <b>numerical</b> example. <b>Sorting</b> problems are studied extensively under three headings. Case-based distance sorting is carried out with Model I, which is optimized for use with cardinal criteria only, and Model II, which is designed for both cardinal and ordinal criteria; both sorting approaches are applied to a case study in Canadian municipal water usage analysis. Sorting in inventory management is studied using a case-based distance method designed for multiple criteria ABC analysis, and then applied to a case study involving hospital inventory management. Finally sorting is applied to bilateral negotiation using a case-based distance model to assist negotiators that is then demonstrated on a negotiation regarding the supply of bicycle components. A new kind of decision analysis problem, called multiple criteria nominal classification (MCNC), is addressed. Traditional classification methods in MCDA focus on sorting alternatives into groups ordered by preference. MCNC is the classification of alternatives into nominal groups, structured by the DM, who specifies multiple characteristics for each group. The features, definitions and structures of MCNC are presented, emphasizing criterion and alternative flexibility.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a computational model, a programming notation, {{and a set}} of programming principles to further and to demonstrate the practicality of programming fine grain concurrent computers. Programs are expressed in the computational model as a collection of definitions of autonomous computing agents called objects. In the execution of a program, the objects communicate data and synchronize their actions exclusively by message-passing. An object executes its definition only in response to receiving a message, and its actions may include sending messages, creating new objects, and modifying its own internal state. The number of actions that occur in response to a message is finite; Turing computability is achieved not within a single object, but through the interaction of objects. A new concurrent programming notation Cantor is used to demonstrate the cognitive process of writing programs using the object model. Programs for <b>numerical</b> sieves, <b>sorting,</b> the eight queens problem, and Gaussian elimination are fully described. Each of these programs involve up to thousands of objects in their exectuion. The general programming strategy is to first partition objects by their overall behavior and then to program the behaviors to be self-organizing. The semantics of Cantor are made precise through the definition of a formal semantics for Cantor and the object model. Objects are modelled as finite automata. The formal semantics is useful for proving program properties and for building frameworks to capture specific properties of object programs. The mathematical frameworks are constructed for building object graphs independently of program execution and for systematically removing objects that are irrelevant to program execution (garbage collection). The formal semantics are complemented by experiments that allow one to study the dynamics of the execution of Cantor programs on fine grain concurrent computers. The clean semantics of Cantor suggests simple metrics for evaluating the execution of concurrent programs for an ideal, abstract implementation. Program performance is also evaluated for environments where computing resources are limited. From the results of these experiments, hardware and software architectures for organizing fine grain message- passing computations is proposed, including support for fault tolerance and for garbage collection...|$|R
