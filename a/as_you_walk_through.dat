40|$|You're {{walking down}} the hall of a mid-sized, {{suburban}} school. You hear yelling and commotion coming {{from one of the}} classrooms. You peek in and see clusters of students scattered throughout the room. It appears they are constructing parachutes from scrap cloth. As <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> around the room, you notice that each cluster of students seems to be constructing the parachute differently. And they don't seem to have clear guidelines for how to create a parachute properly. As you watch, you see the students negotiating with each other to determine the design of the chute as well as ways to test it. Finally, after several revisions, most groups seem to have working parachutes floating through the air. In all this activity, the teacher is walking around the room answering student questions and providing materials when needed. She is clearly not in control of this learning exercise. You wonder to yourself what has become of science education <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> back <b>through</b> the halls in search of a normal classroom. Science education has taken a turn. "Hands-on " or "discovery learning " activities have been replaced with more authentic, student-centered problems that are less structured and less teacher-directed. Whether its called Problem-based Learning or Technological Design, one theme seems clear: constructivism has become a driving forc...|$|R
6000|$|... [Sidenote: Of the springtime of long ago] I {{know not}} {{any time of}} the year that is more full of joyfulness than the early summer season; for that time the sun is wonderfully lusty and strong, yet not so very hot; that time the trees and shrubs are very full of life and very {{abundant}} of shade and yet have not grown dry with the heats and droughts of later days; that time the grass is young and lush and green, so that when <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> athwart the meadow-lands it is <b>as</b> though <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> <b>through</b> a fair billowy lake of magical verdure, sprinkled over with a great multitude of little flowers; that time the roses are everywhere a-bloom, both the white rose and the red, and the eglantine is abundant; that time the nests are brimful of well-fledged nestlings, and the little hearts of the small parent fowls are so exalted with gladness that they sing with all their mights and mains, so that the early daytime is filled full of the sweet jargon and the jubilant medley of their voices. Yea; that is a goodly season of the year, for though, haply, the spirit may not be so hilarious as in the young and golden springtime, yet doth the soul take to itself so great a content in the fulness of the beauty of the world, that the heart is elated with a great and abundant joy that it is not apt to feel at another season.|$|R
60|$|In most {{countries}} {{there is one}} person in particular who seems to typify the race, whose works are the synthesis, as it were, of an entire people. Bernini expressed in this manner a whole age of Italian society; and even now his spirit haunts you as you read the gorgeous sins of Roman noblemen {{in the pages of}} Gabriele d'Annunzio. And Murillo, though the expert not unjustly from their special point of view, see in him but a mediocre artist, in the same way is the very quintessence of Southern Spain. Wielders of the brush, occupied chiefly with technique, are apt to discern little in an old master, save the craftsman; yet art {{is no more than a}} link in the chain of life and cannot be sharply sundered from the civilisation of which it is an outcome: even Velasquez, sans peer, sans parallel, throws a curious light on the world of his day, and the cleverest painters would find their knowledge and understanding of that great genius the fuller if they were acquainted with the plays of Lope de la Vega and the satires of Quevedo. Notwithstanding Murillo's obvious faults, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> the museum at Seville all Andalusia appears before you. Nothing could be more characteristic than the religious feeling of the many pictures, than the exuberant fancy and utter lack of idealisation: in the contrast between a Holy Family by Murillo and one by Perugino is all the difference between Spain and Italy. Murillo's Virgin is a peasant girl such as you may see in any village round Seville on a feast-day; her emotions are purely human, and in her face is nothing more than the intense love of a mother for her child. But the Italian shows a creature not of earth, an angelic maid with almond eyes, oval of face: she has a strange air of unrealness, for her body is not of human flesh and blood, and she is linked with mankind only by an infinite sadness; she seems to see already the Dolorous Way, and her eyes are heavy with countless unwept tears.|$|E

40|$|Radar, Loughborough University's {{contemporary}} art programme, commissioned 6 sound artists and musicians {{to create a}} site specific work as part of Soundwalks. Salomé Voegelin produced 'The Arrangement' to be listened to walking into the town centre from Loughborough train station. "This is a sonic document, the only document I have left, of a brief visit to Loughborough that casts doubt on whether the town actually exists as a solid architectural fact, however firmly it is established on a map, or evidenced in a photographic tourist brochure. You make an arrangement, book a ticket and depart, but <b>as</b> <b>you</b> arrive and <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> its streets it becomes clearer and clearer {{that it is not}} there, you are there. The fleeting voices, your own included, the sounds all around you, the messages left, create an elaborate and opaque design {{in the form of a}} town. But it lacks the assumed opacity of its own architecture, its buildings, its sights, in favour of life living now, dense, porous and complex and there. The buildings seen are but façades, pretending a permanence that is contradicted by the sounds of the town, talking and moving; proclaiming a far more ephemeral presence. The town itself is transitory, passing the trains arriving at its station, rather than the trains passing it. Loughborough in the end becomes the visit rather than Loughborough the town, because Loughborough itself, as shown on the map, does not exist in sound. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{trail is}} themed {{as if it}} had once been the hunting grounds for a wealthy maharajah who {{enclosed}} the forest to allow for easier hunting and then some time later died in a hunting accident. The themed storyline continues with subsequent maharajahs (including the original maharajah's bachelor brother) transforming the area into a nature preserve where the villagers live in harmony with the animals therein. These maharajahs are memorialized {{on the walls of the}} tiger enclosure. The forest was, at one point, also run by imperial British visitors, as evidenced in the Western spelling on the sign at the entrance to the Jungle Trek, which reads [...] "Royal Anandapoor Forest". The Asian animals include tigers, Komodo dragons, Eld's deer, tapirs, flying foxes, water buffaloes, gibbons, and various Asian birds. When their occupation of southern Asia ended, the British turned the forest over to the villagers of Anandapur, whom you encounter <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> the jungle. The trail's storyline also includes an homage to the founder of the Kingdom of Anandapur, Anantah, in the form of a tomb and sarcophagus situated at the entrance to the Jungle Trek's aviary.|$|E
5000|$|Guests were {{admitted}} into Wayne Manor as Gotham City Police Cadets {{on a tour}} of the library. Guests were shown a short video detailing WayneTech's latest developments such as the Gotham City Security Network and the new reconnaissance fleet of aircraft, similarly styled to the Batwing in the 1989 film. This clip was introduced by the chief of the Wayne Foundation, Lucius Fox. Just as Mr. Fox started explaining the new network, they were interrupted by an alert directly from Arkham Asylum, Gotham City's maximum security facility for the city's worst felons. He remarked that it's [...] "probably a false alarm but it doesn't pay to take chances". Batgirl linked to the computer from the Batcave to find that all of Gotham's forces are converging on Arkham Asylum. The television screen would go blank. A guide would then open the secret bookcase revealing the Batcave entrance <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> the Batcave tunnel through to the grouping queues you may hear dripping water and murmurs of bats flying. As guests reach the end of the queue lines the guide announces [...] "I now present to you the Gotham City security network". At this moment several doors would open to reveal the network. It included 14 minor video monitors and one huge projection screen in the middle as well as Batman's controls in front of the screen. There was an animatronic Batman who talks in the Batcave sitting at the desk with his back facing the audience. Guests were seated in the audience and witness a second pre-show video introducing the mission to retrieve the Whitney diamond, stolen earlier from the Gotham Museum of Art. This was stolen earlier by Catwoman and is used to power a freeze cannon operated by Mr. Freeze.|$|E

40|$|The why of {{this book}} “Gardening According to the Bible” We have {{tried to find a}} book that is totally {{dedicated}} to defining the direct relationship to core biblical theology precepts to the physical plant and crop growing seasons and thus, to the seasons of our lives. We could not find this book and thus, we were inspired to write Gardening According to the Bible (GAB). As you will see below, GAB is not the traditional style of book. We purposely resisted making it like a technical document. We wanted GAB to reflect the variations, blessings, and hardships of the garden of our lives [...] Like the most beautiful of gardens and on the richest of farms, GAB is more of a feeling and a warm journey for our souls and hearts as we understand how Jesus loved the garden and used so, so many examples of the garden to teach us how to be good human beings. We hope you will sense and feel this approach <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> presentation within GAB and feel that GAB is much like the garden itself where seeds and plants found their own way. We are sure you will find multiple logic points to debate, misspellings, poor document structure and other editing needed improvements. But, like a summer day at the Seashore, we hope that your walk in the GAB will bring you happiness, joy and understanding...|$|E
40|$|<b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> {{the towering}} Malaysian {{rainforest}} you {{are bound to}} notice the epiphytes that festoon the trunks and branches of nearly every tree. Predominant among these plants are the ferns, with perhaps the most abundant being the bird’s nest fern (Asplenium nidus complex). These are litter basket epiphytes, with a rosette of simple fronds which efficiently intercepts and retains falling leaf litter, giving them a nest-like appearance. The litter then decomposes providing the fern with a source of nutrients. On this diet the ferns can grow to be huge, up to 200 kg wet weight (Ellwood & Foster 2004, Fig 1). If you cut open a bird’s nest fern you discover a world of ants, termites, cockroaches, centipedes and many other arthropods, sheltering in the cool, humid interior of the fern, away from the hot, dry conditions of the canopy. Our group has been studying the diverse invertebrate fauna of these epiphytes for over ten years at the Royal Society run Danum Valley Field Centre in Sabah, Malaysia (Fig 2). Initially work focussed {{on the importance of}} the fern as a previously under-sampled habitat for invertebrate biodiversity. Further work has used the ferns as microcosms to investigate questions relating to ecosystem function and species assembly rules. At the landscape scale we have investigated the importance of bird’s nest ferns as reservoirs of biodiversity in logged forest and oil palm plantation. Bird’s nest ferns are found from the east coast of Africa through India and Southeast Asia to Japan, northern Australia and many islands in th...|$|E
