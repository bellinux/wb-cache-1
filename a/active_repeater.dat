50|$|In 1960, the Courier 1B, {{built by}} then Philco, became the world's first <b>active</b> <b>repeater</b> satellite.|$|E

50|$|Beyond Line-Of-Sight (BLOS) is {{a related}} term {{often used in}} the {{military}} to describe radio communications capabilities that link personnel or systems too distant or too fully obscured by terrain for LOS communications. These radios utilize <b>active</b> <b>repeaters,</b> groundwave propagation, tropospheric scatter links, and ionospheric propagation to extend communication ranges from a few miles to a few thousand miles.|$|R
40|$|The {{decoupling}} {{between two}} monopole antennas, {{to be used}} as transmit and receive elements, placed closely, is a highly important issue in many applications, such as continuous wave (CW) radars, <b>active</b> <b>repeaters,</b> decoys and full duplex transceivers. Depending on the application, a minimum decoupling is required to achieve proper operation, which is usually in the range - 60 dB to - 90 dB. Considering the fact that, in most cases, omni directional coverage is required, the case of monopole antennas of quarter wavelength is considered. Additionally, optimization routines were implemented, taking in account the geometrical characteristics of the antenna in order to control the bandwidth of operation around 10. 25 GHz, leading to either broadband or narrowband behavior, as well as the antennas' gain...|$|R
50|$|USB cables {{are limited}} to 3 m for {{low-speed}} USB 1.1 devices. A hub {{can be used as}} an <b>active</b> USB <b>repeater</b> to extend cable length for up to 5 m lengths at a time. Active cables (specialized connector-embedded one-port hubs) perform the same function, but since they are strictly bus-powered, externally powered (non-bus-powered) USB hubs would likely be required for some of the segments.|$|R
50|$|A {{communications}} satellite {{is an example}} of an <b>active</b> <b>repeater</b> that does change frequency. Communications satellites, in most cases, are in geosynchronous orbit at an altitude of 22,300 miles (35,000 km) above the Equator.|$|E
50|$|Courier 1B was the world's first <b>active</b> <b>repeater</b> {{satellite}} after launch on 4 October 1960. Courier {{was built}} by the Palo Alto, California-based Western Development Labs (WDL) division of Philco, previously known as Army Fort Monmouth Laboratories and now the Space Systems/Loral division of Loral Space & Communications.|$|E
50|$|The first American {{satellite}} to relay communications was Project SCORE in 1958, which used {{a tape recorder}} to store and forward voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower.; Courier 1B, built by Philco, launched in 1960, was the world's first <b>active</b> <b>repeater</b> satellite.|$|E
40|$|In this work, we {{analyze the}} impact of local process {{variations}} on the clock skew of VLSI circuits designed in deep sub-micron technologies. As the size of <b>active</b> <b>repeaters</b> decreases, the utilization of dense buffering schemes, up to complete replacement of metal wiring with active devices, has been proposed in order to realize efficient and noise-immune clock distribution networks. However, local variance of MOSFET electrical parameters, such as VT and IDSS, increases with scaling of device dimensions, thus causing large intra-die variability of the timing properties of clock buffers. As a consequence, we expect local mismatch {{to be a significant}} source of clock skew in deep sub-micron technologies. In order to accurately verify this assumption, we applied advanced statistical simulation techniques and accurate mismatch characterization data to the statistical simulation of relatively small clock distribution networks. The comparison with Monte Carlo simulations performed by neglecting the mismatch effect confirmed {{that it is necessary to}} account for local device variations in the design and sizing of the clock distribution network...|$|R
50|$|The {{relatively}} high-frequency {{carrier wave}} carrying the signal cannot {{pass through a}} power transformer or across the phases of a multiphase system. For split phase systems, the signal can be passively coupled from phase-to-phase using a passive capacitor, but for three phase systems or where the capacitor provides insufficient coupling, an <b>active</b> X10 <b>repeater</b> can be used. To allow signals to be coupled across phases and still match each phase's zero crossing point, each bit is transmitted three times in each half cycle, offset by 1/6 cycle.|$|R
40|$|The major thrust was {{to develop}} a T coupler with very low (0. 1 0. 2 dB) in-line loss. This is {{essential}} to any multiaccess bus structure where the word multi implies fifteen or more nodes on the bus, and it is tacitly assumed to be a passive bus. (Reliability considerations tend to exclude the use of <b>active</b> nodes - <b>repeater</b> nodes. ...|$|R
5000|$|Compared to a {{microwave}} radio relay station with active components, a passive repeater is far simpler and needs little maintenance and no on-site electric power. It {{also does not}} require additional frequencies, unlike <b>active</b> <b>repeater</b> stations which use different transmit and receive frequencies to prevent feedback. The corresponding disadvantage is that without amplification the returned signal is significantly weaker.|$|E
5000|$|Satellite: Not {{really a}} {{propagation}} mode, but an <b>active</b> <b>repeater</b> system. Satellites have been highly successful in providing VHF/UHF/SHF users [...] "propagation" [...] beyond the horizon. The ISS which has amateur radio repeaters and radio location services on board {{is a good}} example. Amateurs have also sponsored the launch of dozens of communications satellites since the 1970s. These satellites are usually known as OSCARs (Orbiting Satellite Carrying Amateur Radio).|$|E
50|$|An <b>active</b> <b>repeater</b> is a powered {{piece of}} {{equipment}} essentially comprising a receiving antenna, a receiver, a transmitter and a transmitting antenna. If {{the ends of the}} NLOS link are at positions A and C, the repeater is located at position B where links A-B and B-C are in fact LOS. The <b>active</b> <b>repeater</b> may simply amplify the received signal and re-transmit it un-altered at either the same frequency or a different frequency. The former case is simpler and cheaper but requires good isolation between two antennas to avoid feedback, however it does mean {{that the end of the}} NLOS link at A or C does not require to change the receive frequency from that used for a LOS link. A typical application might be to repeat or re-broadcast signals for vehicles using car radios in tunnels. A repeater that changes frequency would avoid any feedback problems but would be more difficult to design and expensive and it would require a receiver to change frequency when moving from the LOS to the NLOS zone.|$|E
50|$|Cabot Tower, {{located at}} the top of the hill, {{features}} exhibits about Guglielmo Marconi and the wireless station that operated in the tower. There is a gift shop, and an amateur radio station VO1AA, which may be operated by visiting amateur radio operators in the summer months. It is sponsored by the Society Of Newfoundland Radio Amateurs. An <b>active</b> amateur radio <b>repeater,</b> VO1AAA 146.790+, is located inside the building and is operational year round.|$|R
50|$|This cable {{provided}} intelligent repeaters that counted bit errors {{which were}} reported in response to interrogation from a base station. It contained three fibre pairs which were used to provide two <b>active</b> channels. Each <b>repeater</b> included a base station-controlled cross-over data switch to swap traffic through a choice of two fibre pairs, the switch connections in successive repeaters enabled any desired connection to be made and provide a diversity path when required.|$|R
50|$|A {{significant}} {{advantage is}} that with a USB modem the RF signal is converted to a conventional digital signal at the antenna. Therefore, by using standard USB extension cables, the antenna can be located {{at a distance from}} the computer of five meters or more, with no concerns over microwave signal losses that would occur in an RF coaxial cable feedline of that length used to attach a conventional antenna to the RF input of a computer modem. Chaining <b>active</b> USB <b>repeaters,</b> it is possible to locate the antenna at much greater distances from the computer, which is especially useful when line-of-sight (LOS) obstacles (such as vegetation and walls) require the antenna to be located on the roof, for example. If using mesh reflectors, usually with a grid under 5 mm, the antenna will be lighter and less wind-prone than larger dishes.|$|R
50|$|The first U.S. {{satellite}} to relay communications was Project SCORE in 1958, which used {{a tape recorder}} to store and forward voice messages. It was used to send a Christmas greeting to the world from U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1960 NASA launched an Echo satellite; the 100 ft aluminized PET film balloon served as a passive reflector for radio communications. Courier 1B, built by Philco, also launched in 1960, was the world's first <b>active</b> <b>repeater</b> satellite. Satellites these days are used for many applications such as uses in GPS, television, internet and telephone uses.|$|E
50|$|Passive {{repeaters}} {{may be used}} {{to achieve}} NLOS links by deliberately installing a precisely designed reflector at a critical position to provide a path around the obstruction. However they are unacceptable in most urban environments due to the bulky reflector requiring critical positioning at perhaps an inaccessible location or at one not acceptable to the planning authorities or the owner of the building. Passive reflector NLOS links also incur substantial loss due to the received signal being a 'double inverse-square law' function of the transmit signal, one for each hop from the transmit antenna to the receive antenna. However, they have been successfully used in rural mountainous areas to extend the range of LOS microwave links around mountains, thus creating NLOS links. In such cases the installation of the more usual <b>active</b> <b>repeater</b> was usually not possible due to problems in obtaining a suitable power supply.|$|E
50|$|One {{problem with}} X10 is {{excessive}} attenuation of signals {{between the two}} live conductors in the 3-wire 120/240 volt system used in typical North American residential construction. Signals from a transmitter on one live conductor may not propagate through the high impedance of the distribution transformer winding to the other live conductor. Often, there's simply no reliable path to allow the X10 signals to propagate from one transformer leg wire to the other; this failure may {{come and go as}} large 240 volt devices such as stoves or dryers are turned on and off. (When turned on, such devices provide a low-impedance bridge for the X10 signals between the two leg wires.) This problem can be permanently overcome by installing a capacitor between the leg wires as a path for the X10 signals; manufacturers commonly sell signal couplers that plug into 240 volt sockets that perform this function. More sophisticated installations install an <b>active</b> <b>repeater</b> device between the legs, while others combine signal amplifiers with a coupling device. A repeater is also needed for inter-phase communication in homes with three-phase electric power. In many countries outside North America, entire houses are typically wired from a single 240 volt single-phase wire, so this problem does not occur.|$|E

Specifically, inductance improves the signal slew rate (the rise time), virtually eliminates short-circuit power consumption and reduces the area of the <b>active</b> devices and <b>repeaters</b> inserted to optimize the performance of long interconnects. These positive effects suggest the development of design strategies that benefit from on-chip inductance.

In this paper, we analyze {{the purposes of the}} tourists with different frequency for visiting by applying binary logistic model for questionnaire survey. The result shows that the tourists with different frequency for visiting have different purposes of tourism.
