Increasing DMCA-backed corporate control over the use of digital media has limited educators 2 ̆ 7 ability to teach effectively. The DMCA allows for a triennial challenge to the restrictions on copying media, an elaborate process which the authors successfully negotiated in order to secure an exemption.

Ultimately, this Article concludes that there are too many faults in both the structure and the execution of the rule-making provision to meaningfully counteract the adverse effects of the <b>anti-circumvention</b> <b>provisions</b> of the DMCA.

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the potential impact}} of the proposed fair dealing and <b>anti-circumvention</b> <b>provisions</b> in Canada’s most recent copyright reform bill, Bill C- 32. I suggest that the minimal expansion of the fair dealing defence to cover “new” purposes, as well as the addition of a few new user exceptions, while welcome, is insufficient to ensure the breadth of user defences that the copyright balance demands. Moreover, the extensive protection of technological protection measures without any regard for lawful uses of copyright material has the potential to effectively eviscerate fair dealing in the digital age. Many acts permitted in relation to owned content can be prevented by the use of TPMs, and would be rendered unlawful by the proposed <b>anti-circumvention</b> <b>provisions.</b> To extend legal protection to TPMs in a manner that fails to guard the contours of fair dealing and user rights from technological encroachment is to undermine the social goals of the copyright system, and to relinquish the policy balancing act performed in their name...|$|R

40|$|This Article raises {{two points}} about the <b>anti-circumvention</b> <b>{{provisions}}.</b> First, these provisions seem {{inconsistent with the}} culture of intellectual property. In the world of proprietary boundaries and public domains, there is something special about access to protected works {{and the use of}} limits to avoid infringement, whether we are talking about fairly using copyrighted works or designing-around patented technology. Indeed, cultural enrichment and technological advancement are achieved by fairly using artistic expression and building upon technical knowledge. The focus of this Article is on the access and use of artistic expression in patent law. Second, the <b>anti-circumvention</b> <b>provisions</b> of the DMCA, which aim to protect digital expression by erecting technological fences, have both an expressive and a technical component. These provisions are meant to prevent unauthorized access to and usage of expressive content by prohibiting: (1) access per se to works protected by technological measures, and (2) the manufacture and trafficking of devices primarily designed to circumvent technological restrictions. Thus, patent law, as well as copyright law, addressed this issue of circumvention-enabling technology. Circumvention-enabling technology, such as software, comprises patentable subject matter, and, resultantly, raises questions about the effect of the <b>anti-circumvention</b> <b>provisions</b> on patent law 2 ̆ 7 s constitutional mission to promote the progress of the useful arts. In particular, assuming patent protection is important to the manufacturers of circumvention-enabling technology, one must consider the effect that the anti-device provisions have on the research and development decisions of these manufacturers and, more generally, to patent law 2 ̆ 7 s delicate incentive dynamic. Although the answer to this dilemma {{is beyond the scope of}} this Article, this issue is something that scholars should pursue further...|$|R

50|$|Courts {{have come}} out both ways on the issue.

Custom Hardware Eng'g & Consulting, Inc., 421 F.3d 1307, 1318-19 (Fed. Cir. 2005) the Federal Circuit held that a copyright holder must show a connection to copyright infringement in order to succeed in a claim under the DMCA.|$|R

40|$|In this submission, {{the author}} {{presents}} seven principal proposals for reform that he argues would foster innovation, creativity and marketplace success. First, he argues for an expanded fair dealing provision that would enhance its flexibility. His second reform proposal engages {{with the issue}} of <b>anti-circumvention</b> <b>provisions,</b> where he argues: 1) for a direct link between <b>anti-circumvention</b> <b>provisions</b> and copyright infringement; 2) against bans on devices {{that can be used to}} circumvent technological protection measures (provided that it has non-infringing uses); 3) for the creation of authorized circumventers; and 4) for a positive requirement to unlock for exceptions/right of access. The author then moves on to a consideration of intermediary provisions, and argues for the establishment of a legal safe harbor in the form of a ―notice and notice‖ takedown system for internet intermediaries and a useful provision for Information Location Tool Providers, while rejecting the ―three strikes‖ system adopted in other jurisdictions. Fourth, the author proposes reforming the backup copy provision and rationalizing the statutory damages provisions as a means of modernizing copyright law. The fifth reform proposal involves enhancing the public domain, by rejecting an extension in the copyright term and abolishing Crown copyright. Sixth, library provisions should rely on fair dealing provisions, while there should be no internet exception for education. Lastly, it should not be possible to contract out of the core protections and policies underlying the copyright balance...|$|R

40|$|The {{intellectual}} property law attempts continually to adapt to new developments in technology. Since {{the advent of the}} World Wide Web, digitalization and peer-to-peer sharing technologies, the copyright law fights its greatest curse – online piracy. Piracy causes millions of dollars of losses for the creative industry. Hence the right holders are determined to curb its growth. They pressure the law makers to change the law in order to support their efforts. The most recent legal protection afforded to the industry was the introduction of the <b>anti-circumvention</b> <b>provisions</b> under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 1998 and the Copyright Directive 2001 / 29 /EC in the U. S. and EU respectively. These new laws established the legal prohibition against the circumvention of any effective technological protections measure that blocks the access to or copying of the protected content. These laws also prohibit manufacturing and distribution of the circumvention devices which have a primary purpose to circumvent these technological measures. In the following essay the author discusses the effectiveness and applicability of the anti-circumvention rules, primarily, {{in the light of the}} next stage in the evolution of the Internet – cloud-computing. However, the work also analyses briefly these rules in the context of other issues such as enforcement of foreign judgments. With regard to the effectiveness, the author analyses persisting uncertainties in the interpretation of the anti-circumvention rules and issues related to the enforcement of foreign judgments. As to the applicability of these laws, the author examines contemporary case law on point, together with the role of contract law and technological measures and, finally, the application of fair use doctrine. Moreover, the author provides an example of a cloud-computing service which, arguably, is going to decrease the efficiency and applicability of the anti-circumvention legislation. The name of the service is Spotify and it might well be an answer to the problem of illegal peer-to-peer file sharing. In conclusion, it is submitted that the effectiveness and applicability of <b>anti-circumvention</b> <b>provisions</b> might decrease in the cloud-computing world...|$|R
