40|$|Research on {{the launch}} of new {{products}} in the international realm is scarce. The present paper {{is the first to}} document how launch window (difference in months between the first worldwide <b>launch</b> <b>and</b> the subsequent <b>launch</b> in a specific country) <b>and</b> <b>launch</b> price are interrelated and how regulation influences both <b>launch</b> window <b>and</b> <b>launch</b> price. The research context is the global - 50 countries worldwide - launch of 58 new ethical drugs across 29 therapeutic areas. We show that the fastest launch occurs when the launch price is moderately high <b>and</b> the highest <b>launch</b> price occurs at a launch window of 85 months. We find that the health regulator acts strategically in that {{the extent to which it}} delays {{the launch of}} a new drug increases with the price of the new drug. We also find that regulation overall increases the launch window, except for patent protection. Surprisingly, regulation does not directly impact launch price. The descriptive information on average <b>launch</b> window <b>and</b> <b>launch</b> price <b>and</b> the interconnection between <b>launch</b> window <b>and</b> <b>launch</b> price allows managers in ethical drug companies to build more informed decisions for international market entry. This study also provides public policy analysts with more quantitative evidence regarding <b>launch</b> window <b>and</b> <b>launch</b> price on a broad sample of countries and categories. regulation;pharmaceutical;entry timing;launch price;launch window;international new product launch...|$|R
