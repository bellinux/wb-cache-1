25|$|UNAMIR sent {{an escort}} of ten Belgian {{soldiers}} to Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana, {{with the intention}} of transporting her to the Radio Rwanda offices to <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation.</b> This plan was cancelled because the Presidential Guard took over the radio station shortly afterwards and would not permit Uwilingiyimana to speak on air. Later in the morning, a number of soldiers and a crowd of civilians overwhelmed the Belgians guarding Uwilingiyimana, forcing them to surrender their weapons. Uwilingiyimana and her husband were killed, although their children survived by hiding behind furniture and were rescued by Senegalese UNAMIR officer Mbaye Diagne. The ten Belgians were taken to the Camp Kigali military base, where they were tortured and killed.

500|$|At around noon, {{the news}} of the {{invasion}} was broadcast to the population by Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov: [...] "... Without a declaration of war, German forces fell on our country, attacked our frontiers in many places ... The Red Army and the whole nation will wage a victorious Patriotic War for our beloved country, for honour, for liberty ... Our cause is just. The enemy will be beaten. Victory will be ours!" [...] By calling upon the population's devotion to their nation rather than the Party, Molotov struck a patriotic chord that helped a stunned people absorb the shattering news. Within {{the first few days of}} the invasion, the Soviet High Command and Red Army were extensively reorganized so as to place them on the necessary war footing. Stalin did not <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> about the German invasion until 3 July, when he also called for a [...] "Patriotic War ... of the entire Soviet people".|$|E
2500|$|In December 2015, a {{law passed}} by Tajikistan's {{parliament}} gave Emomali Rahmon the title [...] "Founder of Peace and National Unity, Leader of the Nation" [...] (Tajik: Асосгузори сулҳу ваҳдати миллӣ – Пешвои миллат, Asosguzori sulhu vahdati millî – Peşvo‘i millat; Russian: Основатель мира и национального единства – Лидер нации, Osnovatelj mira i nacionaljnogo jedinstva – Lider necí). A shorter {{version of the}} title, [...] "Leader of the Nation," [...] is used frequently. In addition to granting Rahmon a lifelong immunity from prosecution, the law also gave him {{a number of other}} lifelong privileges including veto powers over all major state decisions, the freedom to <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> and parliament on all matters he deems important, and the privilege of attending all government meetings and parliament sessions.|$|E
2500|$|Campaigning {{directly}} to the people became commonplace. Several 20th century Prime Ministers, such as David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill, were famous for their oratorical skills. After the introduction of radio, motion pictures, television, and the internet, many used these technologies to project their public image and <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation.</b> Stanley Baldwin, {{a master of the}} radio broadcast in the 1920s and 1930s, reached a national audience in his talks filled with homely advice and simple expressions of national pride. Churchill also used the radio to great effect, inspiring, reassuring and informing the people with his speeches during the Second World War. Two recent Prime Ministers, Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair (who both spent a decade or more as prime Minister), achieved celebrity status like rock stars, but have been criticised for their more 'presidential' style of leadership. According to Anthony King, [...] "The props in Blair's theatre of celebrity included ... his guitar, his casual clothes ... footballs bounced skilfully off {{the top of his head}} ... carefully choreographed speeches and performances at Labour Party conferences." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} hours of 12 April, many demanded Chávez's resignation. With the loss of [...] "almost all ... {{military}} force on hand in order to resist or move to another place", Chávez said that he would consider it to avoid a potential bloodbath if there were disturbances involving the crowds outside Miraflores. However, he declared that four conditions would have to be met, including that he be allowed to resign before the National Assembly, with power passing constitutionally to the Vice President prior to new elections, he and his family could go to Cuba and that {{he would be able to}} <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> live on television. But Vásquez and others would not agree to these conditions and dispatched two generals to arrest Chávez. At 3am, with the coup plotters threatening to bomb the Miraflores palace if Chávez did not resign, Chávez phoned the head of the armed forces, General-in-Chief Lucas Rincón saying that he would do so; he in turn told him that the military leadership was divided on whether to oust him or not. Within twenty minutes Rincon had announced on television that Chávez had been asked for his resignation, and had accepted. A few minutes later, Chávez was told that the four conditions he had declared would no longer be accepted, and Chávez declared that he would surrender himself to the coup plotters as [...] "president prisoner". Chávez later said that he told Rincón during their telephone call that he would [...] "abandon" [...] the presidency, after which he [...] "left the palace to negotiate the terms under which he would do so", saying [...] "I am ready to go, but I demand respect for the constitution." ...|$|E
