25|$|If {{the people}} {{come to believe that}} the {{constitution}} is not a text like other texts; if it means, not what it says or what it was understood to mean, but what it should mean, in light of the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, they will look for qualifications other than impartiality, judgment, and lawyerly acumen in those whom they elect to interpret it. More specifically, they will look for people who <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> as to what those evolving standards have evolved to; who <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> as to what the constitution ought to be. If the courts are free to write the constitution anew, they will write it the way the majority wants; the appointment and confirmation process will see to that. This suggests the end of the Bill of Rights, whose meaning will be committed to the very body it was meant to protect against: the majority. By trying to make the constitution do everything that needs doing from age to age, we shall have caused it to do nothing at all.|$|E

25|$|Scott {{had used}} dogs {{on his first}} (Discovery) {{expedition}} and felt they had failed. On that journey, Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson started with three sledges and 13 dogs. But on that expedition, the men had not properly understood how to travel on snow {{with the use of}} dogs. The party had skis but were too inexperienced to make good use of them. As a result, the dogs travelled so fast that the men could not keep up with them. The Discovery expedition had to increase their loads to slow the dogs down. Additionally, the dogs were fed Norwegian dried fish, which did not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> and soon they began to deteriorate. The whole team of dogs eventually died (and were eaten), and the men took over hauling the sleds.|$|E
500|$|Hazlitt ends his {{detailed}} account of the plays with a chapter on [...] "Doubtful Plays of Shakespear", {{the greater part of}} which consists of direct quotations from Schlegel, whose remarks Hazlitt finds worth considering, if he does not always <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> Most of the plays now accepted as Shakespeare's, or at least partly by Shakespeare, were also accepted as his by Hazlitt. The two notable exceptions were Titus Andronicus and Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Of the former, Hazlitt nevertheless respected Schlegel's defence of it enough to quote the latter at length. And he allows that some parts of Pericles could have been by Shakespeare but more likely were [...] "imitations" [...] of Shakespeare [...] "by some contemporary poet." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Wollstonecraft argues against {{excessive}} sensibility, {{the rhetoric}} of the Rights of Woman is at times heated and attempts to provoke the reader. Many of the most emotional comments in the book are directed at Rousseau. For example, after excerpting a long passage from [...] (1762), Wollstonecraft pithily states, [...] "I shall make no other comments on this ingenious passage, than just to observe, that it is the philosophy of lasciviousness." [...] A mere page later, after indicting Rousseau's plan for female education, she writes [...] "I must relieve myself by drawing another picture." [...] These terse exclamations are meant to draw the reader to her side of the argument (it is assumed that the reader will <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>them).</b> While she claims to write in a plain style so that her ideas will reach the broadest possible audience, she actually combines the plain, rational language of the political treatise with the poetic, passionate language of sensibility to demonstrate that one can combine rationality and sensibility in the same self. Wollstonecraft defends her positions not only with reasoned argument but also with ardent rhetoric.|$|E

500|$|Weisman's science journalism style uses {{interviews}} with academic and professional authorities to substantiate conclusions, {{while maintaining the}} [...] "cool and dispassionate ...of a scientific observer rather than an activist". Weisman said he purposely avoided the activist label: [...] "Some of our finest science and nature writers only get read by people who already <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> It's nice to get some affirmation for {{whatever it is you}} believe is true, even if it's quite sobering, but I wanted to write something that people would read ... without minimizing the significance of what's going on, nor trivializing it, nor oversimplifying it." [...] Richard Fortey compares the book to the works of Jared Diamond, Tim Flannery and E.O. Wilson, and writes that The World Without Us [...] "narrowly avoids engendering the gloom-and-doom ennui that tends to engulf the poor reader after reading a catalogue of human rapacity". Mark Lynas in the New Statesman noted that [...] "whereas most environmental books sag under the weight of their accumulated bad news, The World Without Us seems refreshingly positive". Demonstrating the optimism on the grim subject matter Appleton quotes an ecologist from the book saying [...] "if the planet can recover from the Permian, it can recover from the human".|$|E

The most cordial good-feeling had established itself among the mothers. Owing a return for hospitalities received from Lady Myrie and Mrs. Norman, Mrs. Romsey had invited the two ladies to drink tea with her in honor of an interesting domestic event. Her husband, absent on the Continent for some time past, on business connected with his firm, had returned to England, and had that evening joined {{his wife and children}} at Sandyseal.|$|R

We fought for the right of people to vote, we fought for democracy." [...] At an ANC dinner in July, he rebuked Mugabe for refusing to step down.|$|E
2500|$|Many of the world's {{languages}} do {{not have}} gender-specific pronouns. A number of the ones with gender-specific pronouns have {{them as part of}} a traditional grammatical gender system, where all or the vast majority of nouns are assigned to gender classes and adjectives and other modifiers must <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> in that; but a few languages with gender-specific pronouns, such as English, Defaka, Malayalam, Afrikaans, Yazgulyam, and Khmu, lack traditional grammatical gender: and in such languages gender usually adheres to [...] "natural gender".|$|E
2500|$|Salesmen are [...] "persuaders", charismatic {{people with}} {{powerful}} negotiation skills.

Condon's cultural microrhythms study.|$|E

2500|$|The Hopewellian peoples had leaders, {{but they}} were not like {{powerful}} rulers who could command armies of slaves and soldiers. These cultures likely accorded certain families a special place of privilege. Some scholars suggest that these societies were marked by the emergence of [...] "big-men". These leaders acquired their position because of their ability to persuade others to <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> on important matters such as trade and religion. They also perhaps were able to develop influence by the creation of reciprocal obligations with other important members of the community. Whatever the source of their status and power, the emergence of [...] "big-men" [...] was another step toward the development of the highly structured and stratified sociopolitical organization called the chiefdom.|$|E

He castigated the public-concern requirement as [...] " [...] the Court just made up" [...] in his book Can They Do That?.

[...] "You don't need to question management when you <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> and you can't question management when you disagree with them because the very act of questioning them could hurt your working relationship." [...] With exceptions like McPherson, he believes this rule has cost too many public employees their jobs.

2500|$|In 2011, Wikileaks {{published}} diplomatic cables attributing controversial {{comments on}} Islam to Lee. Wikileaks quoted Lee as having described Islam as a [...] "venomous religion".
