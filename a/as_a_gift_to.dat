5|$|Impressed by Betances' credentials, Angiolillo later {{approached}} Betances {{before the}} incident, and discussed his plans with him, which originally implied killing {{one or more}} young members of the Spanish royal family.

Further speculation that Angiolillo used a firearm that Betances himself furnished for him appears to be unfounded (although Betances, who was a fan of firearms himself —he taught a Cuban revolutionary leader {{on how to use}} a Remington machine gun once— gave at least one <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gift</b> <b>to</b> one of his acquaintances).|$|E
