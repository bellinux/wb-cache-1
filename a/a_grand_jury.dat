5|$|If {{the grand}} jury right attaches, every element of the charged crime must be {{submitted}} to {{the grand jury}}. Thus, the prosecution cannot augment the indictment without returning to <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury.</b> But, the government may narrow the indictment without so returning.|$|E

50|$|United States {{law also}} {{provides}} {{for the formation of}} special <b>grand</b> <b>juries.</b> While <b>a</b> regular <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> primarily decides whether to bring charges, <b>a</b> special <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> is called into existence to investigate whether organized crime is occurring in the community in which it sits. This could include, for instance, organized drug activity or organized corruption in government.

5|$|After {{he testified}} before <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> in New York, he was indicted on perjury charges. Although Spivey was not convicted {{when the case}} went to trial in 1953, he was {{prevented}} from competing in the National Basketball Association (NBA) afterward. Spivey instead played professionally for various minor league teams. In 10 Eastern Basketball League (EBL) seasons, his teams won three championships. Spivey retired in 1968 and became a businessman, working in sales and operating restaurants. Upset by the accusations against him in the early 1950s, he was reclusive in his final years.|$|E
5|$|As a {{prominent}} figure in Portland he continually worked {{to raise funds}} for the library he supported.

This allowed him to keep his personal appearance inline with what was expected of prominent citizens. In contravention to his earlier stances during the Oregon Constitutional Convention, Deady later denounced violence against Chinese Americans during the 1870s and 1880s, even convening <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> to examine charging anti-Chinese crowds with criminal acts. These crowds were threatening violence against these minorities in an attempt to expel the immigrants from the state.|$|E

After the two recovered, they appeared before <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> to respond to all charges brought against them.

His lawyers prepared no defense, and noted that he appeared placid {{in the days before}} the trial.|$|E
5|$|On May 23, 1913, <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> convened to hear {{evidence}} for an indictment against Leo Frank {{for the murder}} of Mary Phagan.

Meanwhile, Frank's legal team suggested to the media that Jim Conley was the actual killer, and put pressure on another grand jury to indict him.
