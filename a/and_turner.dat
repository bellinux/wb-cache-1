5|$|Phylogenetic studies {{conducted}} by Senter, et al. (2012) <b>and</b> <b>Turner,</b> Makovicky, and Norell (2012) confirmed that Archaeopteryx was {{more closely related}} to living birds than to dromaeosaurids and troodontids. On the other hand, Godefroit, et al. (2013) recovered Archaeopteryx as {{more closely related to}} dromaeosaurids and troodontids in the analysis included in their description of Eosinopteryx brevipenna. The authors used {{a modified version of the}} matrix from the study describing Xiaotingia, adding Jinfengopteryx elegans and Eosinopteryx brevipenna to it, as well as adding four additional characters related to the development of the plumage. Unlike the analysis from the description of Xiaotingia, the analysis conducted by Godefroit, et al. did not find Archaeopteryx to be related particularly closely to Anchiornis and Xiaotingia, which were recovered as basal troodontids instead.|$|E

In this paper, we propose {{to do the same}} for <b>Turner’s</b> logic, <b>and</b> show thatTurner’s logic can actually be mapped to McCain <b>and</b> <b>Turner’s</b> causal theories. These results can be used to construct a system for reasoning in Turner’s logic. ...|$|R
