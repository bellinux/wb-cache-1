30|$|Assessing the {{underlay}} CRN {{performance by}} {{taking into account}} the spatial distributions of CRN nodes as point processes has attracted much attention recently [11]. In [12], the outage probability of <b>an</b> <b>underlay</b> CRN was established under the assumption that the locations of primary base stations (PBSs) and secondary base stations (SBSs) are modeled as two independent Poisson point processes (PPPs). Also, [13, 14] studied the coverage probability of the uplink transmission of <b>an</b> <b>underlay</b> CRN in which the distributions of PBSs, SBSs, primary users (PUs), and SUs follow independent PPPs. However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, the performance of <b>an</b> <b>underlay</b> OFDM-based CRN, which depends implicitly on the employed subcarrier allocation method, has not been addressed yet.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In <b>an</b> <b>underlay</b> {{cognitive}} radio network, the sec-ondary (underlay) transmitters generate interference to a pri-mary receiver, while <b>an</b> <b>underlay</b> receiver {{is subject to}} interfer-ence from both the primary transmitters and other underlay transmitters not associated with it. Although guard regions, maximum allowable underlay transmit powers, and contention distances help guarantee a minimum performance to the primary network, no such safeguard exists for the underlay network. To this end, this paper characterizes the aggregate interference on <b>an</b> <b>underlay</b> receiver while considering power control and receiver association schemes for both networks. Transmitters and receivers of both networks {{are assumed to be}} distributed as independent Poisson fields in the 2 -D plane, and all links undergo exponential path loss and Rayleigh fading. We derive the moment generating function of the aggregate interference on <b>an</b> <b>underlay</b> receiver and its outage probability. We show that the interference from the primary network does not depend on any node density, and that it dominates the aggregate interference. Furthermore, it is shown that increasing primary and underlay receiver densities reduce the outage probability under lower required power thresholds for the primary receivers. I...|$|R

5|$|The many {{different}} forms of periodic table have prompted {{the question of whether}} there is an optimal or definitive form of periodic table.

An objective basis for chemical periodicity would settle the questions about the location of hydrogen and helium, and the composition of group 3. Such <b>an</b> <b>underlying</b> truth, if it exists, is thought to have not yet been discovered.
