5|$|Ideasthesia {{theory of}} art {{may be used}} for {{psychological}} studies of aesthetics.

There could exist no general classification of art satisfactorily applicable to each and all individuals.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of the Pocket PC version, in 2006 Chahi created a new Windows version {{targeted}} at Windows XP. Emmanuel Rivoire increased the resolution to 1280×800 pixels and Chahi created more detailed backgrounds. He found that his original choice to use polygons for the game characters enabled him to use the original character art at a higher resolution. The game still supports the original 320×200 resolution, as well as the original background <b>art</b> (<b>as</b> an option), and it features twice as many checkpoints as the original, which makes it somewhat easier, as well as newly remixed sounds.|$|E

5|$|Colt was {{the first}} American {{manufacturer}} to use <b>art</b> <b>as</b> a marketing tool when he hired Catlin to prominently display Colt firearms in his paintings. He was awarded numerous government contracts after making gifts of his highly embellished and engraved revolvers with exotic grips such as ivory or pearl to government officials. On a trip to Constantinople he gave a custom-engraved and gold inlaid revolver to the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire Abdülmecid I, informing him that the Russians were buying his pistols, thus securing a Turkish order for 5,000 pistols; he neglected to tell the Sultan he had used the same tactic with the Russians to elicit an order.|$|E

5|$|Homosexual {{interpretations of}} Batman have {{continued}} into the 21st century. One notable example occurred in 2000, when DC Comics refused permission for the reprinting of four panels (from Batman #79, 92, 105, and 139) to illustrate Christopher York's paper All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s. In summer 2005, painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of watercolours depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses. DC threatened both the artist and the Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts gallery with legal action {{if they did not}} cease selling the works and demanded the surrender of all remaining <b>art,</b> <b>as</b> well as any profits derived from them.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Wizard Video, who {{had also}} {{released}} a video game version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, released a Halloween game for the Atari 2600.

Although the game was called Halloween, and featured the film's theatrical poster as its cover <b>art</b> <b>as</b> well as the movie's main music theme, the game itself never refers to any characters, including the killer, by their names in the film.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's mother {{apprentice}}d her son William to a tailor, James Selby. Andrew {{also became}} an apprentice in Selby's shop at age ten and was legally bound to serve until his 21st birthday. Johnson {{lived with his}} mother for part of his service, and one of Selby's employees taught him rudimentary literacy skills. His education was augmented by citizens who would come to Selby's shop to read to the tailors as they worked. Even before he became an apprentice, Johnson came to listen. The readings caused a lifelong love of learning, and one of his biographers, Annette Gordon-Reed, suggests that Johnson, later a gifted public speaker, learned the <b>art</b> <b>as</b> he threaded needles and cut cloth.|$|E
50|$|The {{visual arts}} are <b>art</b> forms such <b>as</b> ceramics, drawing, painting, sculpture, printmaking, design, crafts, photography, video, filmmaking, and architecture.

5|$|Parthian art can {{be divided}} into three geo-historical phases: the art of Parthia proper; the art of the Iranian plateau; and the art of Parthian Mesopotamia. The first genuine Parthian art, found at Mithridatkert/Nisa, {{combined}} elements of Greek and Iranian art in line with Achaemenid and Seleucid traditions. In the second phase, Parthian art found inspiration in Achaemenid <b>art,</b> <b>as</b> exemplified by the investiture relief of Mithridates II at Mount Behistun. The third phase occurred gradually after the Parthian conquest of Mesopotamia.|$|E

40|$|Ma Yi-fu, a great 20 th-century {{master of}} Confucian studies, {{established}} the “Theory of the Six Arts” (“Liu Yi Lun”), a paradigm of Modern Confucianism. Yet Liu Yi Lun, up till now, {{has not been}} fully studied. This dissertation focuses mainly on the detailed content of Liu Yi Lun. With interpretation in the dissertation, Liu Yi Lun {{is viewed as a}} matrix of the emergence of meaning. In Chapter One, the outline of Liu Yi Lun is explained, then I conclude that the Six Arts, in Ma Yi-fu’s Liu Yi Lun, are constituted by four constituent characteristics: the Six <b>Arts</b> <b>as</b> ontological substances as a whole (quan-ti), the Six <b>Arts</b> <b>as</b> great functions (da-yong), the Six <b>Arts</b> <b>as</b> self-cultivations (gong-fu), and the Six <b>Arts</b> <b>as</b> teaching taxonomies (pan-jiao). The previous three characteristics, quan-ti, da-yong and gong-fu, being inclusive and interactive with each other, constitute the general structure of Six <b>Arts</b> <b>as</b> a matrix of meaning. Chapter Two, “The Original Foundation of the Lun Yi Lun”, reveals that the “three-changes” (“san-yi”), constituted naturally by the unchanged (bu-yi), the changes (bian-yi), and the simple changes (jian-yi), make possible the interdependent-formation of the previous three characteristics of the Six Arts. Chapter Three, “On Ma Yi-fu’s View of the Relations of Confucianism and Buddhism” and Chapter Four, “On Ma Yi-fu’s View of Western Philosophy”, are extended topics of the fourth characteristic of the Six Arts, i. e. “the Six <b>Arts</b> <b>as</b> teaching taxonomies”. From these two chapters, we can further comprehend the meaning of Liu Yi Lun and Ma Yi-fu’s philosophical concerns...|$|R
