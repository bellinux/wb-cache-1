5|$|The Ross Perot presidential {{campaign}} of 1992 began when Texas industrialist Ross Perot opened {{the possibility of}} running for President of the United States in the election of 1992 as an independent candidate on the February 20, 1992 edition of Larry King Live. Though he had never served as <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>official,</b> Perot had experience {{as the head of}} several successful corporations and had been involved in public affairs for the previous three decades. Spawned by the American dissatisfaction with the political system, grassroots organizations sprang up in every state to help Perot achieve ballot access following his announcement. James Stockdale, a retired United States Navy vice admiral, was Perot's vice presidential running mate.|$|E
5|$|According to Armando Maya Castro, many {{students}} {{who are members of}} the church have been discriminated against for refusing to partake in celebrations and customs concerning the Day of the Dead in their schools, and some have been punished for it. In one case reported by a Mexican newspaper, La Gaceta, a female member of the church was pushed by a fellow bus passenger, who then crossed herself because the member was wearing a long skirt. In July 25, 2008, <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>official</b> sealed the entrance to a La Luz del Mundo temple in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, trapping the congregation inside until other officials removed the seals. This incident occurred because of complaints from individuals who did not like the presence of the church in the area. Reporter Rodolfo Chávez Calderón stated that the church was in compliance with local laws.|$|E

25|$|Censure is {{the public}} reprimanding of <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>official</b> for {{inappropriate}} conduct or voting behavior. When the president is censured, it serves only as a condemnation and has no direct effect on the validity of presidency, nor {{are there any other}} particular legal consequences. Unlike impeachment, censure has no basis in the Constitution or in the rules of the Senate and House of Representatives. It derives from the formal condemnation of either congressional body of their own members.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the {{war years}} and beyond, Sousa Mendes was optimistic that his {{punishment}} would be reversed and his deed would be recognized. In a 1945 letter to the Portuguese Parliament, {{he explained that he}} had disobeyed orders because he had considered them to be unconstitutional as the Portuguese Constitution forbade {{discrimination on the basis of}} religion. This was the first time that Sousa Mendes used this line of argument and he explained that he hadn’t used it before because, being <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>official,</b> he did not want to attract publicity and therefore compromise Portugal’s neutrality.|$|E

25|$|In {{the current}} form, {{mandatory}} Swedish was implemented {{as a part}} of the modernisation of the educational system in the 1970s. Previously, a Swedish test had been compulsory on university level and in oppikoulu, a secondary school that was a prerequisite to matriculation to a university, but not in the common kansakoulu. The introduction of the peruskoulu (student ages 7–15), compulsory for all children, introduced a course in Swedish compulsory to all pupils, while Swedish courses and standardized tests at higher levels remained compulsory. This was motivated by the possibility that any student could become <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>official</b> and would thus be required to know Swedish.|$|E

25|$|McCreight {{resigned}} in 1872 on a motion of non-confidence, and on December 23, 1872, Trutch asked De Cosmos {{to form a}} new government as Premier. De Cosmos populated his cabinet with reformers, mostly born in North America, many of whom would come to dominate provincial politics for a generation. His government pursued an agenda of political reform, economic expansion, and the development of public institutions — especially schools. De Cosmos also focused on advancing the completion of the transcontinental railway promised under the Terms of Union. It was, however, De Cosmos' attempt to alter the Terms of Union in order to obtain monetary guarantees from the federal government to complete a dry dock at Esquimalt that eventually led to accusations of impropriety, and ended his provincial political career. He speculated heavily in land and in Texada Island Iron mines, which brought further criticism, as he was <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>official.</b> Thus he ended his tenure as Premier on February 9, 1874.|$|E

For example, Abramoff and Scanlon provided things of value to <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>official</b> (described as Representative #1) and members of his staff, including, but not limited to, a lavish trip to Scotland to play golf on world-famous courses, tickets to sporting events and other entertainment, regular meals at Abramoff’s upscale restaurant, and campaign contributions for the Representative, his political action committee, his campaign committee, and other political committees on behalf of the Representative. At the same time, and in exchange for these things of value, Scanlon and Abramoff sought and received the Representative’s agreement to perform directly and through others a series of official acts, including but not limited to agreements to support and pass legislation, and agreements to place statements in the Congressional Record.|$|E
