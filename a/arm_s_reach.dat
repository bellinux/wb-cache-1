40|$|<b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> {{length is}} an idiomatic English phrase {{which refers to}} a metaphor that uses the human body as a measure. The hand is not {{directly}} joined to the body, it maintains an undeniable distance from the body, equivalent {{to the length of}} an arm. In this sense, the metaphorical meaning of being at <b>arm</b> <b>s</b> length means to be at a certain distance, not too close and not too far away. The expression is often used in contract law, and a contract concluded between parties at <b>arm</b> <b>s</b> length will ensure that the parties are independent and on equal footing when concluding the agreement. The National Credit Act applies to every credit agreement between parties dealing at <b>arm</b> <b>s</b> length. <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> length is a novel concept in the South African credit vocabulary and not defined in the Act.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} history of the community of nuclear arms control experts in the United States during the middle and later years of the Cold War, the age of thermonuclear ballistic missiles. Arms control experts were, in many interesting ways, both insiders and outsiders to the American "nuclear state. " The dissertation begins by exploring the formation of strategic arms control in the years leading up to 1960, showing how arms control emerged from the mixing of local communities of disarmament advocates and theorists of nuclear deterrence. Rather than inevitable doctrinal unity, early arms control was highly local and contingent. In particular, the crucial concept of "stability" was open to multiple interpretations. In the 1960 <b>s,</b> <b>arms</b> control problems motivated groundbreaking scientific research. Elite contract consultants to the government contemplated the use of lasers as weapons against ballistic missiles. As consultants performed calculations and experiments in the context of classified discussions and studies, they founded a new field of physics called nonlinear optics. In the late 1960 <b>s,</b> strategic <b>arms</b> control became a public issue during a complex political dispute over missile defense. Arms control experts mediated and fueled this controversy by participating in a surprising range of activity, rallying alongside local residents whose neighborhoods would be impacted by missile defense installations, and criticizing defense policy in Congressional testimony-even as they worked their connections to the White House. In the 1960 s and 1970 <b>s</b> <b>arms</b> controllers shaped a changing institutional landscape for the support of arms control expertise. They built arms control into a new government agency, and later drew on the resources of philanthropic foundations to create major university arms control centers. By the 1980 <b>s,</b> <b>arms</b> control <b>reached</b> peak public visibility amid controversy over the Reagan administration's Strategic Defense Initiative. This dissertation uses the private papers and correspondence of numerous experts, a wide range of arms control publications, and government records to explore the diverse practices of arms control. It engages a wider discussion among historians about the status of Cold War elites, the relationship between experts and the American state, and the character of scientific knowledge during the Cold War. by Benjamin Tyler Wilson.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sorafenib (S), a multitargeted {{tyrosine}} kinase inhibitor, {{is the standard}} of care for first-line systemic treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Everolimus (E) is a potent inhibitor of mTOR, a pathway frequently activated in HCC. Preclinical {{data suggest that the}} combination S + E has additive effects compared with single-agent S. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with unresectable or metastatic HCC and Child-Pugh â‰¤ 7 liver dysfunction were randomized to receive daily S 800 mg alone or with E 5 mg until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was progression-free survival at 12 weeks (PFS 12). The secondary end points included response rate, PFS, time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), duration of disease stabilization (DDS), safety, and quality-of-life (QoL) assessments. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were randomized: 46 patients received S and 60 patients received S + E. Ninety-three patients were assessable for the primary end point and 105 patients for the safety analysis. The PFS 12 rate was 70 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 54 - 83] and 68 % (95 % CI 53 - 81) in patients randomized to S and S + E, respectively. The RECIST (mRECIST) response rate was 0 % (23 %) in the <b>S</b> <b>arm</b> and 10 % (35 %) in the <b>S</b> + E <b>arm.</b> Median PFS (6. 6 versus 5. 7 months), TTP (7. 6 versus 6. 3 months), DDS (6. 7 versus 6. 7 months), and OS (10 versus 12 months) were similar in the S and <b>S</b> + E <b>arms,</b> respectively. Grade 3 / 4 adverse events occurred in 72 % and 86 % of patients in <b>arm</b> <b>S</b> and <b>arm</b> <b>S</b> + E, respectively. Patients had similar QoL scores over time, except for a greater worsening in physical well-being and mood in the <b>arm</b> <b>S</b> + E. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence was found that S + E improves the efficacy compared with S alone. Combining 5 mg E with full-dose S is feasible, but more toxic than S alone. Further testing of this drug combination in molecularly unselected HCCs appears unwarranted. CLINICALTRIALSGOV: NCT 01005199...|$|R

40|$|The Ã“bidos Lagoon is {{the largest}} shallow coastal lagoon in Portugal. Like any other {{brackish}} water system, it has been potentially exposed to different sources of contamination (e. g. livestock farming, domestic and industrial sewage). Trace metals are persistent elements present {{in the water and}} sediments in their elemental and organic/inorganic forms. In fact, Cadmium is extremely pollutant due to its great solubility in water and high toxicity for organisms. Also, it is classified as a priority substance according to the European Union Water Frame directive. In this context, a seasonal environmental monitoring program was implemented in the intertidal water margins of the Ã“bidos Lagoon to assess the presence of Cadmium. In 2009 and 2010, eight sampling stations (S) distributed on the shores of the Ã“bidos Lagoon were chosen and water and sediments were seasonally collected. In all samples, cadmium concentrations were analyzed by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry, with Graphite Furnace Technique. Cadmium dissolved in the water samples was only detected during summer months, with the highest values in the Barrosaâ€™s <b>arm</b> (<b>S</b> 3 : 0. 35 mg/l) in 2009, and at the station further downstream (S 1 : 0. 19 mg/l) in 2010. In the suspended fraction of the water samples the trace metal was detectable in all seasons, with the maximum concentration at the Barrosaâ€™s <b>arm</b> (<b>S</b> 4 : 1. 04 mg/l) in the winter of 2010. Cadmium was not detectable in the sediments during the summers and was sporadically present in the autumn and in the winter of 2009. The highest concentration in the sediments was observed at the BarrosaÂ´s <b>arm</b> (<b>S</b> 4 : 140. 78 mg/kg) in the spring of 2010. As a whole, cadmium contamination appears to be mostly focused on the inner areas of the lagoon, at the BarrosaÂ´s arm, but a clear seasonal pattern of variation was not detectable. These results allow {{a better understanding of the}} environmental quality of this ecosystem and may assist in the definition of coastal management measures specifically targeted to trace metal contamination and pollution monitoring...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of three chapters. In Chapter I (Price Caps with Capacity Precommitment), we study the effectiveness of price cap regulation in a monopolistic setting under demand uncertainty. In our model, a monopolist facing an uncertain demand. In the absence of capacity precommitment, price caps remain an effective regulatory instrument, {{just as they are}} when demand is deterministic. Price caps are also an effective instrument to regulate a monopoly that makes irreversible capacity investments ex-ante, and then chooses its output up to capacity upon observing the realization of demand. In this scenario, however, the optimal price cap must trade off the incentives for capacity investment and capacity withholding, is well above the unit cost of capacity and, when the unit cost of capacity is low, is below the price cap that maximizes capacity. Moreover, a price cap alone cannot eliminate inefficiencies. Under standard regularity assumptions on the demand distribution, the comparative static properties of price caps above the optimal price cap are analogous to those they have in the absence of capacity precommitment. The Chapter II and Chapter III are aimed at analyzing the competitive consequences of imposition of the <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> Length Principle (ALP, henceforth) requirements for international transfer pricing. In order to discourage tax shifting activities by multinational fi rms, most countries follow taxation policies that are based on the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations, which recommend that, for tax purposes, internal pricing policies be consistent with ALP (i. e., that transfer prices between companies of multinational enterprises for tax purposes be established on a market value basis, thus comparable to transactions between independent, unrelated, parties). Moreover, ALP puts associated and independent enterprises on a more equal footing for tax purposes, it avoids the creation of tax advantages that would otherwise distort the relative competitive positions of either type of entity. The failure to comply with the ALP may result in a penalty. The OECD s recommendation that transfer prices between parent firms and their subsidiaries be consistent with the ALP for tax purposes does not restrict internal pricing policies. In Chapter II (Strategic Incentives for Keeping One Set of Books under the <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> Length Principle), we show that under imperfect competition parent rms accounting policies determine the properties of market outcomes: if parents keep one set of books (i. e., their internal transfer prices are consistent with the ALP), then competition in the external (home) market softens (intensi es) relative to an equilibrium where parent fi rms and subsidiaries are integrated. In contrast, if rms keep two sets of books (i. e., their internal transfer prices differ from those used for tax purposes) or maintain asymmetric accounting policies, then competition intensi es in both markets. Keeping one set of books turns out to be an equilibrium for most of the parameter space. In Chapter III (The Non-Neutrality of the <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> Length Principle with Imperfect Competition), we show that under imperfect competition the <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> Length Principle is non-neutral: a strict (lax) application of the ALP softens competition among subsidiaries (parents). Thus, under imperfect competition regulating transfer pricing optimally requires trading off its impact on market outcomes and tax revenue...|$|R

40|$|Concerned by the {{overwhelming}} presence of vexatious federal securities-fraud class actions, Congress passed the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 {{to increase the}} procedural burden plaintiffs would face in filing these nonmeritorious suits.
