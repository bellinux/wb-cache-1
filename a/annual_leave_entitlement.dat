30|$|According to the Federal Holidays Act (Bundesurlaubsgesetz), {{the minimum}} {{entitlement}} to paid recreational holiday is 20 working {{days per year}} based on a five-day work week. Many collective or individual agreements, however, include more favourable regulations. Overall, the <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> <b>entitlement</b> for workers covered by collective agreements in Germany is six weeks per year (cf. Schnitzlein 2011). The Collective Agreement Archive of the WSI reports this collectively agreed annual paid holiday leave of employees, distinguishing basic and actual total leave by industries. Collective agreements can determine basic leave for an employee, which is then raised {{in one or more}} stages to the actual total leave. Requirements for an increase can be age, duration of affiliation with the enterprise, wage bracket, etc. Based on details provided by the WSI, basic and actual total leave are weighted on a  40 / 60 basis to obtain the overall leave, which is a plausible proportion also according to analyses of the GSOEP.|$|E
40|$|The {{telecommunications}} company Mobitel Ltd employed an antiquated {{system for}} the calculation of employees' annual leave entitlements and issuing the appropriate notices. The main objective of this dissertation {{was to develop a}} new system based on modern technologies in order to substantially reduce processing time, establish a paperless operating environment and increase data security. The new system obtains the relevant employee data from a database, calculates the applicable <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> <b>entitlement,</b> assigns a document into which it records the results and sends it into an electronic distribution system. The employee receives an e-mail with a notification and a link to the document stored in the archive system and can confirm its receipt with an electronic signature. The system was developed using the Microsoft. NET Framework and the Windows Workflow Foundation library. The electronic distribution of documents was deployed through the company's existing system. The calculation of annual leave was implemented using workflows, which increased the transparency of the procedure. Using a visual approach in compiling the calculation conditions resulted in {{a better understanding of the}} procedure by both the system developers as well as the users. This approach also made frequent changes to the calculation conditions less demanding - an operation that could be relegated from the development team to the system maintenance team.

40|$|Using {{data from}} wave 5 of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, this study examines: (i) {{the extent to}} which Australian {{employees}} use their <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> entitlements; and (ii) the association between <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> taking and weekly hours of work. After restricting attention to employees likely to have entitlement to at least four weeks of paid <b>annual</b> <b>leave,</b> it is found that the mean number of days of leave taken per year is around 16 and that the majority (63 %) take less than 20. The incidence of <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> taking is found to vary positively correlated with the number of usual weekly hours of work, but the size of this effect is small and weak. It is concluded that persons who regularly report long hours of work each week are mostly not compensating by taking extended periods of leave each year, but neither is there evidence to support the hypothesis that the pressures at work that might lead many people to regularly work very long hours each week also cause them to forego their <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> <b>entitlements.</b> ...|$|R

The length of time a child needs a carer for can vary. We always aim to return children to the care of their parents or extended family, however for a small number of children this is not possible and the decision is made to seek a new home for them. Children who may need foster care include: • �Young people whose parents can't care for them because of illness. • �Young people whose family circumstances mean they may be at risk of neglect or physical, emotional or sexual abuse. • �Children whose behavioural difficulties mean their own families can't cope. • �Children who attend residential schools and need a home base during the school holidays. Who can apply to be a foster carer? Falkirk Council has criteria that must be met by those applying to foster a child: • �Applicants must live within the Falkirk Council area or within 30 miles of the Social Work Headquarters at Brockville, Falkirk. • �Married or cohabiting couples must have a wellestablished and evidenced stable relationship. • �Applications are also welcome from single people. • �Applications from families with children are welcome. • Ideally applicants will be over the age of 21.

40|$|Working time {{is mostly}} studied {{in terms of}} daily and weekly hours. However, longer breaks from work, {{in the form of}} paid <b>annual</b> <b>leave,</b> are also an {{important}} aspect of working time, and can help workers manage the fit between their working lives and activities beyond work. Analysing nationally representative data from the Australian Work and Life Index we find that 60 % of full-time workers with an <b>entitlement</b> to paid <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> did not use their full <b>leave</b> <b>entitlement</b> in 2009. Compared to an earlier survey in 2002, very little has changed. Work-related pressures are prominent barriers to leave uptake. There are significant work–life penalties for not taking paid <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> – particularly for workers with parenting responsibilities and for women. When asked to choose between two weeks’ additional paid leave and an equivalent pay rise, the majority choose more paid leave over a pay increase.

There is also a case for more assertive management of leave, so that workers can take <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> regularly rather than allow leave to accumulate. ...|$|R
40|$|M Development and Management (Public Management and Governance), North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2014 The {{framework}} {{of this study}} is based on the reforms of human resource leave management in the field of public administration for the South African public sector. The researcher’s interest lies in the increasing complexity of leave management development pertaining to policy-making, administrative processes and efficiency in the South African public sector. This study aimed to assess leave management at the Department of Correctional Services (DCS) and the Department of Home Affairs (DHA). The DCS and DHA form part of the seven departments in the Justice, Crime Prevention and Security Cluster. The study aimed to assess the coping strategies of the two departments especially with the services rendered in a tight schedule and constraints. Furthermore, this study was also influenced by the findings of the investigations led by the Public Service Commission (PSC) which aimed to determine effectiveness of leave management in the South African Public Service. The objectives of this study were realised by means of a literature review and research instruments. The literature review was consulted to understand the context of leave management. This study applied the qualitative technique for reporting data. The interviews were used to ascertain the processes of managing leave whereby two sets of questionnaires were developed. The interviews posed the questions to the management of the DCS and DHA and the employees of the two departments. The management of <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> <b>entitlements</b> is important to maintain the wellbeing of the employees, an organisation’s productivity and to help minimise associated financial implications incurred. The study found that the accrual of leave by public servants is a practice with significant financial implications for the state as employer. If leave is not managed and controlled effectively it can result in substantial losses in terms of unwarranted expenditure. The financial and other implications of leave prompted an investigation by the P S C aimed at determining how effective leave is managed in the Public Service. The study also found that reasonable measures were put in place for managing leave in the public sector. The office of the Health Risk Manager was developed to manage the process for approving the leave of absence as it relates to temporary incapacity leave, permanent incapacity leave and the occupational diseases. The empirical surveys conducted indicated that the two departments are well equipped for managing leave as they are required by labour law. The practices of planning, communication, control measures were also proven to be utilised in the two departments. The two departments render their services in a constrained manner, however the management has attempted to ensure that service delivery is not compromised when some of the members are on <b>leave.</b> <b>Leave</b> <b>entitlements</b> forms part of the accountability framework for the public sector especially when leave is attached to financial resources which are part of public money. In conclusion this study concludes that the public sector must consider the employee assisted systems for applying for leave. Such practices could also enhance the administrative backlogs encountered when recording leaves. Application of leave through such systems may also improve the productivity of the leave officers and reduce the cost of administrative resources. Master...|$|R
40|$|The casualisation of the Australian {{workforce}} proceeded {{at a more}} or less steady pace from 1992 to 2004. Introduction There is {{no formal}} definition of casual employment {{in the sense that it}} has a meaning set down in law or specified in awards and agreements. Instead, casual employment has generally been regarded as employment in which there is an absence of <b>entitlement</b> to paid <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> or sick leave. The absence of paid <b>leave</b> <b>entitlements</b> was first adopted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) as a proxy measure of casual employment in 1988. While this approach can be justified on the grounds that most persons on a casual contract receive a pay loading in lieu of paid <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> and sick leave, the problem is there is no necessary correlation between type of employment contract and qualifications for these entitlements. The ABS has since dropped the term ‘casual’ and now simply distinguishes between employees with paid <b>leave</b> <b>entitlements</b> and those without. While the ABS also collects information for a category of worker it describes as ‘self-identified casual’, this quick guide maintains the proxy measure that a casual employee is an employee without paid <b>leave</b> <b>entitlements.</b> It should be noted, however, that owner managers of incorporated enterprises (OMIEs) are excluded from the scope of the definition of casual employee. There is no sense in which OMIEs can reasonably be regarded as casual employees and, even though the ABS has tended to treat OMIEs as employees of their own business, it is possibly for this reason that from 2007 the ABS ceased to ask OMIEs if they gave themselves paid leave...|$|R

Getting closer to the leave legislation of particular states is preparation for a comparison of particular institutes and sub-institutes of leave of each labour code.

50|$|Leaveism (Leavism) {{is a term}} first coined in 2013 by Dr Ian Hesketh, a {{researcher}} at Lancaster University Management School in the UK, to describe the phenomena of employees using flexitime, <b>annual</b> <b>leave,</b> rest days and other <b>leave</b> <b>entitlement</b> schemes to have time off {{when they are in}} fact too unwell to go to work. He later extended this to include occasions whereby employees took work home and/or on holiday that they could not complete in paid working hours. Hesketh's research, which centred on well-being in the UK police service, sought to identify a lacuna in current thinking around Absenteeism and Presenteeism; of which there is a plethora of academic study and commentary.
