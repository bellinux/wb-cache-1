5|$|Alf took John to {{his brother}} Sydney's house, in the Liverpool suburb of Maghull, {{a few months before}} Julia came to term. Julia's daughter, Victoria Elizabeth, born in the Elmswood Nursing Home on 19June 1945, was {{subsequently}} given up for adoption to a Norwegian Salvation Army Captain and his wife (Peder and Margaret Pedersen) after intense pressure from the Stanley family. John Lennon was informed by his Aunt Harriet of her existence in 1964. John was so overcome by emotion, wanting to find his sister, that he placed <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> <b>in</b> the paper, and hired detectives to look for her. They searched Norway for Victoria, and came up empty handed, and John died never having found or knowing her.|$|E
5|$|Julian Carlton was a 31-year-old man {{who came}} {{to work as a}} chef and servant at Taliesin for the summer. Carlton was an Afro-Caribbean of West Indian descent, ostensibly from Barbados. He was {{recommended}} to Wright by John Vogelsong, Jr., the caterer for the Midway Gardens project. Carlton and his wife Gertrude had previously served in the house of Vogelsong's parents in Chicago. Originally a genial presence on the estate, Carlton grew increasingly paranoid. He stayed up late at night with a butcher knife, looking out the window. This behavior had been noticed by Wright and Borthwick, who issued <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> <b>in</b> a local paper for a replacement cook. Carlton was given notice that August 15, 1914 would be his last day in their employ.|$|E

5|$|Raimi {{asked for}} help and {{assistance}} from several {{of his friends and}} past collaborators to make The Evil Dead. Campbell was cast as Ash Williams, the main character. To acquire more actors for the project, Raimi put <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> <b>in</b> The Detroit News. Betsy Baker was one of the actresses who responded, and Ellen Sandweiss, who appeared in Within the Woods, was also cast. The crew consisted almost entirely of Raimi and Campbell's friends and family. The make-up adviser for Within the Woods, Tom Sullivan, was brought on to compose the effects after expressing a positive reaction to working with Raimi.|$|E
5|$|Stunned, the {{remaining}} Chili Peppers, {{who had no}} suitable replacement for Frusciante, hired Arik Marshall to play {{the remaining}} dates after being forced to reschedule. Upon returning to Hollywood, the band placed <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> <b>in</b> the L.A. Weekly for open guitar auditions, which Kiedis {{considered to be a}} waste of time. After several months of unsuccessfully looking for a suitable guitarist, drummer Chad Smith suggested Dave Navarro. He had always been the band's first choice, but had been too busy following the 1991 breakup of Jane's Addiction. Navarro eventually accepted the position after productive jam sessions.|$|E
5|$|Poolside: The segment {{opens with}} Donovan on a pier, holding a newspaper. He {{returns to his}} house, strips by the pool and begins reading. Intrigued by <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> <b>in</b> {{the back of the}} paper, Donovan writes a letter in response. After a number of days pass (marked by the cliché device of {{fluttering}} calendar pages), he receives a reply {{in the form of a}} package. Inside is a tablet, which he throws into the pool. The water starts to churn and the dark-haired Danny Di Cioccio emerges to Donovan's delight. The two couple by the pool, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Di Cioccio in a variety of positions. Di Cioccio turns the tables and tops Donovan until Donovan's climax. The scene closes with the two engaged in horseplay in the pool and then walking off together down a boardwalk.|$|E

25|$|The discography of the English {{alternative}} {{rock band}} Suede consists of seven studio albums, three compilation albums, five video albums and over twenty singles. Suede were formed in 1989 by singer Brett Anderson, bassist Mat Osman and guitarist Justine Frischmann. Guitarist Bernard Butler later joined after the group responded to <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> <b>in</b> the Melody Maker. The group played as a four-piece with a drum machine until drummer Simon Gilbert joined. Frischmann {{left before the}} group released any material.|$|E

Herold, prosperous {{businessman}} from Omaha, Nebraska, consults Wolfe about re-establishing {{contact with his}} son, whom he had (as it eventually transpired) falsely accused of theft eleven years before. The son, Paul Herold, had consequently broken almost all ties with the family, changed his name and moved to New York City. Even the latter meagre information was only known because Paul has recently sent his sister a birthday card postmarked NYC. The father has already taken obvious steps such as <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> <b>in</b> the newspaper and consulting the Missing Persons Dept of NYPD.|$|E

Reed appeared on a billboard in Times Square with a LIVE TO SURF tattoo and subsequently {{on the cover of}} Abercrombie & Fitch's 2004 back-to-school catalog. More than 10 million homes throughout the United States received a copy of that catalog, and that cover subsequently has appeared as <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> <b>in</b> Rolling Stone, GQ, Teen Vogue, and the premiere issue of VITALS. Reed credits the 2004 Abercrombie & Fitch cover for giving him the needed credentials to make it as a professional model.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Friedrich von Kammacher (Olaf Fønss), a surgeon, is devastated {{after his}} wife {{develops}} a brain disorder and is institutionalized. On {{the advice of his}} parents, von Kammacher leaves Denmark to gain some respite from his wife's illness. Von Kammacher travels to Berlin, where he meets a young dancer named Ingigerd (Ida Orloff) and the doctor becomes fond of her and very interested in her. However she has a large amount of admirers and thus Von Kammacher gives up on her. However, while in Paris he sees <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> <b>in</b> the paper that she is going to New York with her father and decides to follow her. Von Kammacher buys a first ticket on the same liner as Ingigered, the SS Roland.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of all this, Lou Pearlman in 1992 placed <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> <b>in</b> the Orlando Sentinel to compose a vocal group. McLean, {{who was the first}} to {{audition}} for Pearlman in his living room, became the group's first member. In January 1993, Pearlman held an open casting call and hundreds of young performers auditioned at his blimp hangar in Kissimmee. Eventually, Carter, Dorough, and Richardson were selected after meeting Pearlman's expectations. Littrell flew from Kentucky to Orlando to formally join the group on April 20, 1993, a day after receiving a phone call from Richardson about it. Thus, April 20 became their anniversary date. Pearlman decided to call them Backstreet Boys, after Orlando's Backstreet Market, an outdoor flea market near International Drive which was also a teen hangout.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, Sixx founded Mötley Crüe with drummer Tommy Lee. They {{were later}} joined by guitarist Mick Mars through <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> <b>in</b> the local newspaper, and singer Vince Neil, with whom Lee had {{attended}} high school. The band self-recorded their debut album, Too Fast for Love, which was subsequently released in November 1981 on the band's own Leathür Records label. After signing with Elektra Records they re-released the album. The band {{then went on}} to record and release Shout at the Devil, raising the band to national fame. They issued three more albums during the 80's, Theatre of Pain in 1985 and Girls, Girls, Girls in 1987, and Dr. Feelgood in September 1989. The latter ended up being their most successful record, staying in the charts for 114 weeks after its release.|$|E
25|$|In late 1972, Simmons and Stanley {{came across}} <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> <b>in</b> the East Coast version of Rolling Stone placed by Peter Criss, a veteran drummer from the New York City scene who had {{previously}} played in the bands Lips and Chelsea. Simmons and Stanley met him in a nightclub where he was playing drums. After hearing Criss sing, they thought of him being in the band. Criss then auditioned for and later joined the new version of Wicked Lester. The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than Wicked Lester played. They also began experimenting with their image by wearing makeup and various outfits. In November 1972, the trio played a showcase for Epic Records A director Don Ellis, {{in an effort to}} secure a record deal. Although the performance went well, Ellis disliked the group's image and music.|$|E
25|$|After a {{break to}} recuperate, the band teamed up with {{engineer}} Joe Gibb to create a high-tech studio setup. Brown had been soaking up the Leeds dance scene, while Hussey's explorations were towards folk music. The band, asked to perform a lucrative headlining gig at Finsbury Park in 1991, brought out quite a different side, joined by Maartin Allcock of Fairport Convention and Anthony Thistlethwaite of The Waterboys. Many long-standing fans left the gig worried {{about the direction of}} the forthcoming release, Masque (produced by Mark Saunders). Masque was originally intended to be a solo release by Hussey, however the remaining band members contributed to the recording, and the album was released under the group name as a result. Adams left the group subsequent to the release of the album. Reduced to a duo, the Mission began searching for new members, even placing <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> <b>in</b> the Melody Maker.|$|E

25|$|Greg Sostrom saw The Crucified {{at a few}} {{shows and}} offered them a {{recording}} contract with his new start-up label, Narrowpath Records. The band accepted the offer and started to record songs at Casbah Studios in Southern California. The 15-track album was titled The Crucified. It was released in compact disc format, which was a new format in the late 1980s. After the album's release, the band started to tour around California, including appearances at the Cornerstone Festival as well as opening for D.R.I., G.B.H., and Pantera. Johnson was fired from the band due to personal differences and the guys started {{looking for a new}} bassist. Chaffin responded to <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> <b>in</b> a newspaper posted by Jeff Bellew, citing The Crucified as an influence. Bellew joined the band and drove for four hours from his home in So Cal to Fresno every weekend to practice. Eventually the drive became too costly, and he moved to Fresno to practice with the band.|$|E
25|$|Norma is lured from Dr Stillingfleet by <b>an</b> <b>ad</b> <b>in</b> the {{newspaper}} to meet David, and is again drugged. Frances kills David. She sets {{it up to}} appear that Norma did it, but {{the blood on the}} knife was congealed when Norma found herself holding it. With police and family gathered in the flat, Poirot announces that Andrew did die in Africa. Robert Orwell poses as her father to gain the wealth of the family. He had David paint portraits of him and his late wife in the style of a painter popular 20 years earlier as part of the ruse. Most cruelly {{he and his wife have}} been giving Norma various drugs that give her hallucinations and an altered sense of time, to set her up as guilty. Further, the wife had poisoned herself hoping to pin that on Norma, too. Louise wrote to Andrew on learning he was back in England, so Frances killed Louise; this is the murder Norma feared she did. The woman posing as stepmother was also Frances, who used a blonde wig to cover her dark hair when changing roles. Poirot takes the wig from her bag to make that point. Murder of the two who could expose the imposters was just one of her crimes. Sonia is exonerated when she finds the papers Sir Roderick misplaced, and the two will marry. Poirot had chosen Dr Stillingfleet to help him with Norma in hopes the two would marry, and they will.|$|E
