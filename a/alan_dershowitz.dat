Finkelstein was placed on administrative leave for the 2007–08 academic year, and on September 5, 2007, he announced his resignation after coming to a settlement with the university on generally undisclosed terms. An official statement from DePaul strongly defended the decision to deny Finkelstein tenure, stated that outside influence played {{no role in the}} decision.

25|$|Though {{the phrase}} sexual {{harassment}} is generally acknowledged to include clearly damaging and morally deplorable behavior, its boundaries can be broad and controversial. Accordingly, misunderstandings can occur.

25|$|Harvard law {{professor}} <b>Alan</b> <b>Dershowitz</b> {{wrote that the}} problem with the report is what its composers willfully and deliberately refused to see and hear.

50|$|Patterson {{concludes that}} the sole common {{experience}} for blacks in post-blackness is “nothing more” than shared experiences in everyday life: to live with and overcome “old-fashioned racism” and learning {{to live with the}} white gaze. He sees therefore a close resemblance to <b>Alan</b> <b>Dershowitz's</b> theory of “the Tsuris Theory of Jewish Survival”; in that he claims that American Jews are always in need of “external troubles and imagined enemies” to maintain their identity.|$|R

25|$|<b>Alan</b> <b>Dershowitz</b> {{and others}} have {{suggested}} reserving the word marriage for religious contexts as part of privatizing marriage, and in civil and legal contexts using a uniform concept of civil unions, in part to strengthen the separation between church and state.

25|$|United States Senators Kelly Ayotte, Saxby Chambliss, Lindsey Graham, and John McCain, and Representative Peter T.

Others said that doing so would be illegal, including prominent American legal scholar and lawyer <b>Alan</b> <b>Dershowitz,</b> and would jeopardize the prosecution.

25|$|Amnesty International (AI) {{has been}} accused by the American Jewish Congress and NGO Monitor of having a double {{standard}} with its assessment of Israel. Professor <b>Alan</b> <b>Dershowitz,</b> an American legal scholar and columnist for the Huffington Post, has attacked Amnesty International's perceived bias against Israel, claiming that AI absolves Palestinian men of responsibility for domestic violence and places the blame on Israel instead and that it illegitimately characterises legal acts of Israeli self-defence as war-crimes. Dershowitz has joined NGO Monitor's calls for an independent evaluation of anti-Israeli bias within the organisation.|$|E
25|$|One {{of those}} making anti-Semitism charges against Cockburn was Harvard law {{professor}} <b>Alan</b> <b>Dershowitz.</b> In November 2005, Dershowitz {{wrote to the}} National Catholic Reporter that Cockburn's CounterPunch web site was anti-Semitic. This {{was in response to}} a review of Norman Finkelstein's book Beyond Chutzpah by CounterPunch contributor, Israeli academic Neve Gordon. Cockburn had previously accused Dershowitz, in 2003, of plagiarism, and, in October 2005, of supporting torture. Cockburn and Dershowitz each denied the other's charges. Dershowitz also claimed that Cockburn was one of three writers (along with Finkelstein and Noam Chomsky) engaged in an attempt to discredit him, which Cockburn also denied.|$|E
25|$|Sean Penn as David Kleinfeld. For {{the pivotal}} role of Carlito's sleazy lawyer and best friend, Penn was lured back from early {{retirement}} by {{the challenge of}} playing the corrupt lawyer. Taking the role meant that he could finance his movie The Crossing Guard and work with Pacino. De Palma and Penn sat down and discussed what '70s mob lawyers looked like. Often, men {{in the entertainment business}} can look more bizarre than the talent they represent. Penn shaved the hair on the front of his forehead to give the appearance of a receding hairline. He permed the rest. <b>Alan</b> <b>Dershowitz,</b> believing that Penn was attempting to look like him, threatened the filmmakers with a defamation lawsuit.|$|E
