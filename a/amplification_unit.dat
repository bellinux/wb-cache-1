The <b>amplification</b> <b>unit</b> {{in all cases}} consisted of a large genomic region coamplified with the coding region of the myc genes themselves. In eight independent neuroblastomas containing N-myc amplifications, the <b>amplification</b> <b>unit</b> {{was estimated to be}} 290 to 430 kilobases. This <b>amplification</b> <b>unit</b> was highly conserved among the different neuroblastomas, with some neuroblastomas containing almost identical units.

We have circumvented these problems by combining in gel renaturation of amplified sequences with the polymerase chain readion.

40|$|A system {{allowing}} the induction of DNA amplification in Bacillus subtilis was developed, {{based on a}} thermosensitive plasmid, pE 194, stably integrated in the bacterial chromosome. An <b>amplification</b> <b>unit,</b> comprising an antibiotic resistance marker flanked by directly repeated sequences, was placed next to the integrated plasmid. Activation of pE 194 replication led to DNA amplification. Two different amplification processes appeared to take place: one increased the copy number of all sequences {{in the vicinity of}} the integrated plasmid and was possibly of the onion skin type, while the other increased the copy number of the <b>amplification</b> <b>unit</b> only and generated long arrays of amplification units. These arrays were purified and shown to consist mainly of directly repeated amplification units but to also contain non-linear regions, such as replication forks and recombination intermediates. They were attached to the chromosome at one end only, and were, in general, not stably inherited, which suggests that they are early amplification intermediates. Longer arrays were detected before the shorter ones during amplification. When the parental <b>amplification</b> <b>unit</b> contained repeats which differed by a restriction site the arrays which derived thereof contained in a majority of cases only a single type of repeat. We propose that the amplified DNA is generated by rolling circle replication, and that such a process might underlie a number of amplification events...|$|E

40|$|Rearrangements of {{chromosome}} 11 q 13 {{are frequently}} observed in human cancer. The 11 q 13 region harbors several chromosomal breakpoint clusters found in hematologic malignancies and exhibits frequent DNA amplification in carcinomas. DNA amplification patterns in breast tumors {{are consistent with}} the existence of at least 4 individual <b>amplification</b> <b>units,</b> suggesting the activation of more than I gene in this region. Two candidate oncogenes have been identified, CCND 1 and EMSI/CORTACTIN, representing centrally localized <b>amplification</b> <b>units.</b> Genes involved in the proximal and distal amplicons remain to be identified. Recently we reported on a putative transforming gene, MYEOV, mapping 360 kb centromeric to CCND 1. This gene was found to be rearranged and activated concomitantly with CCND 1 in a subset of t(11; 14) (q 13;q 32) -positive multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines. To evaluate the role of the MYEOV gene in the proximal amplification core, we tested 946 breast tumors for copy number increase of MYEOV relative to neighboring genes or markers. RNA expression levels were studied in a subset of 72 tumors for which both RNA and DNA were available. Data presented here show that the MYEOV gene is amplified in 93 % (90 / 946) and abnormally expressed in 16. 6 % (12 / 72) of breast tumors. Amplification patterns showed that MYEOV was most frequently coamplified with CCND 1 (74 / 90), although independent amplification of MYEOV could also be detected (16 / 90). Abnormal expression levels correlated only partially with DNA amplification. MYEOV DNA amplification correlated with estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive cancer, invasive lobular carcinoma type and axillary nodal involvement. In contrast to CCND 1 amplification, no association with disease outcome could be found. Our data suggest that MYEOV is a candidate oncogene activated in the amplification core located proximal to CCND 1. (C) 2002 Wilev-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Natural transformation, {{duplication}} insertion, and plasmid {{transformation in}} Deinococcus radiodurans, a bacterium that contains 4 to 10 chromosomes per cell, were studied. Duplication insertions were often heterozygous, with some chromosomes containing highly amplified insertions and others containing no insertions. Large amplified regions were apparently deleted by intrachromosomal recombination, generating as by-products extrachromosomal circles consisting of multiple tandem repeats of the amplified sequence. The circles were of heterogenous integer sizes, containing {{as many as}} 10 or more <b>amplification</b> <b>units.</b> Two strains that are defective in natural transformation and sensitive to DNA-damaging agents were further characterized. Both strains were defective in duplication insertion. While on strain was normal for plasmid transformation, the other was totally defective in this regard, suggesting that plasmid transfer in D. radiodurans may require recombinational functions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, an {{improved}} method of power control is introduced {{to widen the}} range of output power with high efficiency. Two CMOS class-E power amplifiers (PA) with different output power are adopted in the design. In order to eliminate the phase mismatch of two paths, a continuously adjustable CMOS phase shifter with a predictable phase transfer function is added before each PA. Meanwhile, the drain modulation technique is presented to vary the voltage supply of the <b>amplification</b> <b>unit.</b> With the combination of drain modulation and parallel amplification, {{a wider range of}} output power is obtained than the previous one. The amplifiers work in 915 MHz with the supply voltage of 1. 8 V and 2. 5 V.

40|$|Escherichia coli drug {{resistance}} plasmids were introduced into Deinococcus radiodurans by cloning D. radiodurans DNA into the plasmids prior to transformation. The plasmids were {{integrated into the}} chromosome of the transformants and flanked by a direct repeat of the cloned D. radiodurans segment. The plasmid and one copy of the flanking chromosomal segment constituted a unit ("amplification unit") which was found repeated in tandem {{at the site of}} chromosomal integration. Up to 50 copies of the <b>amplification</b> <b>unit</b> were present per chromosome, accounting for approximately 10 % of the genomic DNA. Circular forms of the <b>amplification</b> <b>unit</b> were also present in D. radiodurans transformants. These circles were introduced into E. coli, where they replicated as plasmids. The {{drug resistance}} determinants which have been introduced into D. radiodurans in this fashion are cat (from Tn 9) and aphA (from Tn 903). Transformation of D. radiodurans to drug resistance was efficient when the donor DNA was from D. radiodurans or E. coli, but was greatly reduced when the donor DNA was linearized with restriction enzymes prior to transformation. In the course of the study, a plasmid, pS 16, was discovered in D. radiodurans R 1, establishing that all Deinococcus strains so far examined contain plasmids...|$|E

We report here the molecular cloning of cDNA sequences complementary to mRNAs coding for four such polypeptides. The plasmidic probes have been exploited to characterize their complementary mRNAs and to quantify the copies of these cognate genes in a variant and in two revertant clones. The results show that different mRNAs code for the four polypeptides; their accumulation is accounted for by amplification of their specific genes; these observations suggest that cells overproducing AMPD are characterized by the presence of <b>amplification</b> <b>units</b> comprising several expressed genes...|$|R
40|$|Amplification {{of genes}} can {{sometimes}} be detected by molecular hybridization but not by cytogenetic methods, suggesting {{that in some cases}} the <b>units</b> of <b>amplification</b> may be too small to be detected by light microscopy. The experiments reported here investigate whether submicroscopic <b>amplification</b> <b>units</b> are present in early passages of the human tumor cell lines HL- 60 and COLO 320. The results show that such cells do contain submicroscopic, extrachromosomal, supercoiled circular molecules harboring MYC genes. The molecules in HL- 60 are approximately 250 kilobase pairs (kbp), while those in COLO 320 are 120 - 160 kbp. The extrachromosomal molecules in HL- 60 are shown to replicate semiconservatively and approximately once in one cell cycle. We propose that these submicroscopic elements are precursors of double-minute chromosomes, the usual extrachromosomal manifestation of gene amplification, since both are structurally similar and replicate autonomously...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{characterized}} N-myc {{gene amplification}} in three human neuroblastoma cell lines (IMR- 32, TGW, GOTO). Rearrangements in long-range regions surrounding amplified N-myc genes were examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Since rare-cutting enzymes completely digested DNA {{at the middle}} of the N-myc gene, we were able to construct a physical map upstream and downstream of the germline N-myc gene, and to obtain information on restriction sites surrounding amplified N-myc genes. This method enables us to envisage the organization of amplified units over a long range. Digestion patterns differed considerably among the germline and the three cell lines, but were simple in each case. We estimated that the minimal distance between neighboring N-myc genes is at least several hundred kilobases. Our data suggest that <b>amplification</b> <b>units</b> contain several DNA fragments derived from ditterent loci, but that they are homogeneous...|$|R

Patient 2 ̆ 7 s heart rate variability should be continuously monitored to help them in case of emergency. Under these circumstances, patients are required to have a HRV measuring kit for a constant observation. The proposed project focuses on the development of a heart rate variability measurement system with the use of embedded electronics. This project consists of two systems: transmitter and a receiver side system. The transmitter section composed of sensor, amplifier, processing unit, and display unit, and transmitter module. The sensors, which are pasted on the body, are used to sense the electrical activity of the heart. These electric signals are given to an <b>amplification</b> <b>unit.</b> This <b>amplification</b> <b>unit</b> is designed with IC ADS 1293 to amplify and filter the signals, and also reduce the noise. The output of the amplifier is given to the processing unit. Here, the microcontroller is programmed to process the input signal, and calculate the heart rate. The output of the microcontroller is transmitted to the display unit. The display unit shows the current value of the heart rate. The continuous measurement of heart rate variability is done in the transmitter side system. In case of abnormalities, a GSM module is used to transmit the heart rate alert, which has been processed by the control unit, to the user 2 ̆ 7 s mobile phone and GSM receiver modem.

40|$|Research {{evidence}} indicates that hearing aids and auditory trainers worn by school children routinely malfunction. Ensuring properly functioning amplification is a preferred educational practice and is required by PL 94 - 142 regulations. Research was needed to determine if schools were complying with the regulations and recommended educational procedures. This study described and evaluated procedures used by educational agencies to monitor and maintain <b>amplification</b> <b>units</b> worn by hearing-impaired students. Two examiner-developed survey intruments were mailed to residential and public day school teachers and administrators to collect data and answer 11 research questions pertaining to: (1) monitoring and maintenance procedures, (2) relationships between demographic, personnel, and placement characteristics and preferred monitoring and maintenance practices, and (3) monitoring and maintenance practices compared with a model of preferred practice. Personnel were surveyed in one residential school for the deaf in each state and a stratified random sample of 200 public day schools. A total of 310 (63 %) surveys were returned from 164 (65. 6 %) administrators and 146 (58. 4 %) teachers. Results indicated {{that the majority of}} programs had some system of monitoring and maintaining <b>amplification</b> <b>units,</b> but only 54. 1 % (73) performed daily checks of hearing aids and 58. 3 % (67) performed daily checks of auditory trainers. Teachers in 76. 9 % of the sample reported that electroacoustic analysis was available as one part of audiologic evaluation, but not usually scheduled on a routine basis. Teachers were responsible for monitoring activities in over 75 % of programs, regardless of the educational model: self-contained, resource, or itinerant. Significant positive relationships were found between (1) program size and one preferred monitoring and maintenance variable, (2) full-time audiologist and three preferred variables, (3) residential school placement and four preferred variables, (4) inservice training and three preferred variables, (5) full-time audiologist and program size and (6) full-time audiologist and residential school placement.

A new mechanism of L-myc activation which results from the production of rlf-L-myc fusion protein was recently reported.

Recombination between the two nonfunctional neomycin gene sequences generates an intact neomycin resistance gene that is functional in both bacteria and mammalian cells. Using these plasmid substrates, we have characterized the frequencies and products of recombination events that occur in mouse 3 T 6 cells soon after transfection and also after stable integration of these DNAs.

Our project aims to identify the patients who are likely to develop diabetic foot ulcers at an early stage. We accomplish this by fixing pressure sensors in six pressure points of the foot.

Judicious deployment of new antimalarials and vaccines could benefit from an understanding of early molecular events that promote the evolution of parasites. Continuous in vitro challenge of Plasmodium falciparum parasites with a novel dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor reproducibly selected for resistant parasites. Genome-wide analysis of independently-derived resistant clones revealed a two-step strategy to evolutionary success. Some haploid blood-stage parasites first survive antimalarial pressure through fortuitous DNA duplications that always included the DHODH gene. Independently-selected parasites had different sized <b>amplification</b> <b>units</b> but they were always flanked by distant A/T tracks. Higher level amplification and resistance was attained using a second, more efficient and more accurate, mechanism for head-to-tail expansion of the founder unit. This second homology-based process could faithfully tune DNA copy numbers in either direction, always retaining the unique DNA amplification sequence from the original A/T-mediated duplication for that parasite line. Pseudo-polyploidy at relevant genomic loci {{sets the stage for}} gaining additional mutations at the locus of interest. Overall, we reveal a population-based genomic strategy for mutagenesis that operates in human stages of P. falciparum to efficiently yield resistance-causing genetic changes at the correct locus in a successful parasite. Importantly, these founding events arise with precision; no other new amplifications are seen in the resistant haploid blood stage parasite. This minimizes the need for meiotic geneti...|$|R

New generations of therapies are frequently associated with specific genetic alterations driving the need to determine the genetic makeup of tumor cells. Here, we present a microfluidic device for parallel single cell whole genome amplification (pscWGA) to obtain enough copies of a single cell genome to probe for the presence of treatment targets and the frequency of its occurrence among the tumor cells.

40|$|Bacteria {{have the}} ability to adapt to various {{challenging}} environments. The rate, extent and consequences of bacterial adaptation depend on both microbial and environmental factors. This thesis analyses some of the mechanisms bacteria can employ to adapt to novel environments such as the presence of antibiotics, during infection of a host, and when exposed to growth-limiting conditions. Bacterial adaptation to antibiotics is conferred by mutations that usually modify essential cellular functions. In the absence of the drug, the adaptive mutations often confer a fitness cost measured as a decrease in growth rate and/or virulence. Bacteria can in many cases compensate for such fitness costs by acquiring second-site mutations. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa we showed that high levels of quinolone resistance are associated with high fitness costs. However, no-cost and compensatory mutations are common in strains resistant to low levels of quinolones. Decreased fitness, conferred by single resistance mutations in gyrA, was associated with decreased DNA supercoiling. Fitness and supercoiling could be restored to wild-type level without loss of resistance. The supply of mutations might be limiting during adaptation to novel selections. We showed that the rate of adaptation of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to mice could be accelerated by increases in the mutation supply, mediated by increased mutation rate or population size. An increased mutation rate was however associated with accumulation of deleterious mutations that decreased fitness in secondary environments. Bacterial adaptation to limiting growth conditions was studied in a genetic system that employs a strain with a mutant lac allele on plasmid F'lac 128. This strain can adapt to growth on lactose by amplification of the mutant lac allele followed by mutation to Lac+. To further investigate the mechanisms behind this adaptation we identified and compared duplication join points detected before and after selection for gene amplification. We showed that large pre-existing lac duplications, with long sequence homologies, are common in the unselected population. In contrast, after selection for growth on lactose, most duplications were smaller with short sequence homologies at the join points. This discrepancy {{can be explained by the}} inefficiency of large duplications to amplify and form Lac+ revertants compared to shorter <b>amplification</b> <b>units.</b> Unique short homology join points could be detected in the unselected population although they were rare. Some short homology duplications may arise from remodeling of large duplications to yield a short amplicon that can amplify more efficiently. A subset of Lac+ revertants was associated with mutation accumulation in unselected genes. We showed that the unselected mutations were only detected in cells where the error-prone polymerase DinB was co-amplified with lac. Thus, the associated mutagenesis is a side effect when dinB and lac are within the same amplified unit. Taken together, these results further confirm that Lac+ revertants do not arise from a stress-induced hypermutable state as has been suggested.

In {{order to determine the}} sensitivity of detection and applicability of modified in gel renaturation, primary human tumor cultures and drug resistant human cell lines with identified cellular gene amplifications were assayed. The modified in gel renaturation technique was then used to screen 71 human tumor cell lines and direct tumor biopsies for amplified sequences. Particular emphasis was placed on screening cell lines derived from human melanoma and direct tumor samples from adult sarcomas. Four of 55 cell lines tested had amplification ≥ 10 -fold of previously known cellular oncogenes. None of the 25 melanoma short term cultures tested positive by this assay. One of 16 adult sarcoma samples (a malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH)) tested positive for DNA sequence amplification > 10 -fold. The amplified DNA present in this MFH, (termed ST- 23987), was not identified by Southern blot analysis with a panel of oncogene probes previously reported as amplified in other human malignancies. In order to further characterize the amplified DNA in ST- 23987, DNA was subjected to in gel renaturation cloning procedures followed by PCR modified cloning. Of 55 clones isolated and analyzed, four cloned inserts (termed pMAC 895, pMAC 15, pMAC 20, and pMAC 30) were amplified between 10 -to- 15 -fold in ST- 23987 DNA. Several other adult sarcomas were probed with these four clones and three other instances of amplification were identified by Southern blot analysis with probes generated from pMAC 15 and pMAC 30 (found in tumors ST- 24609, 870141 and ST- 23493). A bacteriophage lambda genomic library was constructed from DNA isolated from a ST- 23493. Four clones representing ∼ 34 kb of the amplified domain (designated 493. 1, 493. 2, 493. 4, and 493. 5) were isolated using clones pMAC 15 and pMAC 30 as probes. Plasmid subclones generated from the EcoRI fragments of the amplified bacteriophage lambda clones (termed p 10. 5, p 6. 0, p 5. 2, p 5. 0, p 4. 7, p 2. 8, and p 0. 5) were used as probes against Northern blots of sarcoma mRNA in an attempt to identify transcribed sequences within the cloned regions of the <b>amplification</b> <b>unit.</b> The hypothesized target gene carried within the <b>amplification</b> <b>unit</b> will likely be important to the progression, diagnosis and treatment of adult sarcoma, irrespective of the target gene identity...|$|E
40|$|Organophosphorus {{insecticide}} (OP) {{resistance in}} several Culex species {{is associated with}} increased esterase activity resulting from amplification of the corresponding structural gene. In Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus, high levels of OP resistance (approximately 800 times) are due to the esterase B 1 gene, which is amplified at least 250 -fold. This gene has now been sequenced, {{and the structure of}} the <b>amplification</b> <b>unit</b> (amplicon) encompassing the structural gene has been partially characterized. The inferred amino acid sequence of the enzyme revealed regions of strong homology with other eukaryotic serine-esterases, such as cholinesterases, which are the target of OPs. The amplicon covers at least 30 kilobases and contains a constant and highly conserved "core" of 25 kilobases. This core carries a single copy of the esterase gene (2. 8 kilobases) as well as other sequences that are present as single or low number copies in the genomes of mosquitoes lacking overproduction of the esterase B 1 protein. In the amplicon, the esterase gene is framed by two DNA sequences that are repeated {{in other parts of the}} genome of resistant mosquitoes and found in the genome of susceptible mosquitoes but not near the esterase B 1 gene. It is suggested that these repetitive sequences may have a role in the amplification process...|$|E
40|$|Electrostatic {{charge is}} {{generated}} during powder handling due to particle-particle and particle-wall collisions, rubbing, sliding, and rolling. In case of bipolar charge generation, the electrostatic forces may significantly change the inner forces and increase powder adhesion and cause {{a serious problem}} in material handling process. Therefore, the knowledge of distribution of charge across the individual particles is helpful to identify the role of triboelectrification {{and the effects of}} various relevant variables especially change in the contact materials, environmental conditions during processing, etc. A novel approach based on inductive sensor has been developed to detect the either polarity of charged particle and to characterise the bipolar charge distribution in the population of particulate material. To achieve this, an <b>amplification</b> <b>unit</b> configured as a pure integrator and signal processing techniques has been used to de-noise and correct the baseline of signal and MATLAB algorithm developed for peak detection. The polarity of charged particles obtained by this method is calibrated with Faraday pail method and the results are promising. Experimental study has been carried out by using two distinct populations of oppositely charged particles (glass beads-PVC, olivine sand, and silica sand). The obtained results indicate that the method is able to detect the distribution of polarities of charged particles. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Sharks are {{suffering}} from intensive exploitation by worldwide fisheries leading to a severe decline in several populations in the last decades. The lack of biological data on a species-specific basis, associated with a k-strategist life history {{make it difficult to}} correctly manage and conserve these animals. The aim {{of the present study was}} to develop a DNA-based procedure to discriminate shark species by means of a rapid, low cost and easily applicable PCR analysis based on 5 S rDNA repeat <b>units</b> <b>amplification,</b> in order to contribute conservation management of these animals. The generated agarose electrophoresis band patterns allowed to unequivocally distinguish eight shark species. The data showed for the first time that a simple PCR is able to discriminate elasmobranch species. The described 5 S rDNA PCR approach generated species-specific genetic markers that should find broad application in fishery management and trade of sharks and their subproducts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Rapid {{identification}} and differentiation of mosquito-transmitted flaviviruses in acute-phase sera {{of patients and}} field-caught vector mosquitoes are important for the prediction and prevention of large-scale epidemics. Results We developed a flexible reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal <b>amplification</b> (RT-LAMP) <b>unit</b> for the detection and differentiation of dengue virus serotypes 1 - 4 (DENV 1 - 4), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and West Nile virus (WNV). The unit efficiently amplified the viral genomes specifically at wide ranges of viral template concentrations, and exhibited similar amplification curves as monitored by a real-time PCR engine. The detection limits of the RT-LAMP unit were 100 -fold {{higher than that of}} RT-PCR in 5 of the six flaviviruses. The results on specificity indicated that the six viruses in the assay had no cross-reactions with each other. By examining 66 viral strains of DENV 1 - 4 and JEV, the unit identified the viruses with 100 % accuracy and did not cross-react with influenza viruses and hantaviruses. By screening a panel of specimens containing sera of 168 patients and 279 pools of field-caught blood sucked mosquitoes, results showed that this unit is high feasible in clinical settings and epidemiologic field, and it obtained results 100 % correlated with real-time RT-PCR. Conclusions The RT-LAMP unit developed in this study is able to quickly detect and accurately differentiate the six kinds of flaviviruses, which makes it extremely feasible for screening these viruses in acute-phase sera of the patients and in vector mosquitoes without the need of high-precision instruments. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cumulative {{information}} available about {{the organization of}} amplified chromosomal regions in human tumors suggests that the <b>amplification</b> repeat <b>units,</b> or amplicons, can be of a simple or complex nature. For the former, amplified regions generally retain their native chromosomal configuration and involve a single amplification target sequence. For complex amplicons, amplified DNAs usually undergo substantial reorganization relative to the normal chromosomal regions from which they evolve, and the regions subject to amplification may contain multiple target sequences. Previous efforts to characterize the 7 p 11. 2 epidermal growth factor receptor) amplicon in glioblastoma have relied primarily {{on the use of}} markers positioned by linkage analysis and/or radiation hybrid mapping, both of which are known to have the potential for being inaccurate when attempting to order loci over relatively short (< 1 Mb) chromosomal regions. Due to the limited resolution of genetic maps that have been established through the use of these approaches, we have constructed a 2 -Mb bacterial and P 1 -derived artificial chromosome (BAC-PAC) contig for the EGFR region and have applied markers positioned on its associated physical map to the analysis of 7 p 11. 2 amplifications in a series of glioblastomas. Our data indicate that EGFR is the sole amplification target within the mapped region, although there are several additional 7 p 11. 2 genes that can be coamplified and overexpressed with EGFR. Furthermore, these results are consistent with EGFR amplicons retaining the same organization as the native chromosome 7 p 11. 2 region from which they are derived...|$|R
