Next, the background modelling module is employed in order to generate a high-quality adaptive background model using a unique two-stage training procedure and a mechanism for recognizing changes in illumination. As the final step of their process, the proposed object extraction module computes the binary object detection mask by applying suitable threshold values.

For this reason, it is an essential need to make the users aware of the potential misuses as well as the associated privacy risk consequences.

An important task of water quality sensors is to give information to the operators if a contamination has occurred in the network. Generally, the overall analysis of the sensor data is performed manually by the operators since data-driven alarm generation systems for protecting a network in real time are not established at water utilities. This has several reasons: At first, the parameterization of these modules is often very complex and time consuming. Secondly, in most cases these systems generate too many false positive alarms due to special operational actions like sensor calibration or flushing of pipes. In this paper an approach is presented which addresses both problems. First, a self-configuring <b>alarm</b> generation <b>module</b> is proposed which only needs a few parameters to be set. Next, using the module, it is shown that the amount of false positive alarms can be reduced, if known events are used for training the module.

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{electricity}} market deregulation has placed great {{emphasis on the}} availability of information, the analysis of this information, and the subsequent decision-making to optimize system operation in a competitive environment. This creates a need for better ways of correlating the market activity with the physical grid operating states in real time and sharing such information among market participants. Choices of command and control actions may result in different financial consequences for market participants and severely impact their profits. This work provides a solution, the Intelligent Economic Alarm Processor to be implemented in a control center to assist the grid operator in rapidly identifying the faulted sections and market operation management. The task of fault section estimation is difficult when multiple faults, failures of protection devices, and false data are involved. A Fuzzy Reasoning Petri-nets approach has been proposed to tackle the complexities. In this approach, the fuzzy reasoning starting from protection system status data and ending with estimation of faulted power system section is formulated by Petri-nets. The reasoning process is implemented by matrix operations. Next, in order to better feed the FRPN model with more accurate inputs, the failure rates of the protections devices are analyzed. A new approach to assess the circuit breaker?s life cycle or deterioration stages using its control circuit data is introduced. Unlike the traditional ?mean time? criteria, the deterioration stages have been mathematically defined by setting up the limits of various performance indices. The model can be automatically updated as the new real-time condition-based data become available to assess the CB?s operation performance using probability distributions.

40|$|The {{lithium lens}} in the {{antiproton}} source target vault {{is protected by}} an interlock system, which is located in relay racks R 5 and R 6 near {{the southwest corner of}} the Target Hall (building APO). The interlock system consists of crates of commercial signal conditioner and alarm modules built by Acromag, Inc and interlock Master Modules built by Fermilab: Twenty analog signals from the lens/transformer, power supply, and cooling water system are buffered with signal conditioners (amplifiers), which are located in creates R 5 C and R 5 E. The signals and conditioner assignments are listed in Table 1. Interconnection details are shown in Figure 1. Thermocouple signals come into the conditioners directly from the vault or water system via 12 -pair multiconductor thermocouple extension cables. All other signals pass through a master connection panel on the east end of rack R 6. Water flow signals are AC voltages which must be converted by electronics in crate D 2 B to DC voltages before entering their signal conditioners. Each conditioner drives two parallel outputs. One output goes to a Multiplexed Analog to Digital Converter (MADC 25), which is located in R 5 D. This voltage output is read by the accelerator control network (ACNET) and can be displayed at any control console on parameter page P 46. The other voltage output is connected to an <b>alarm</b> <b>module.</b> Thirteen analog signals are processed by alarm modules, which are located in crates R 6 B and R 6 C. Alarm connection details are shown in Figure 2. Each <b>alarm</b> <b>module</b> contains two DPDT relays, one for an upper limit and one for a lower limit. The relays are latching, so that once an input has passed outside a limit, that limit relay remains in the tripped condition until an operator issues a reset pulse. The reset may be generated locally with a pushbutton on the appropriate interlock master module or remotely from controls parameter page P 46 via ACNET. Alarm settings are summarized in engineering units in Table 1, and actual comparitor voltage settings are listed in Figure 2. Each alarm crate contains 10 module slots and is wired as shown in Figure 3, except for the water conductivity slot, which is wired to a separate interlock chain output. Normally open contacts are used for interlock chains, while normally closed contacts provide status bits. The interlock chain outputs are connected to Interlock Master Modules located in D 5 C. Status bits are read into ACNET through a multiplexer in R 4 A, and can be displayed on parameter page S 40. Any alarm slot may be bypassed by inserting a 'dummy' printed circuit card in place of a module. Each interlock master module sums 5 inputs and provides 3 reed relay contact closure outputs. A circuit schematic is shown in Figure 4. Input 1 requires + 5 volts, and directly energizes an interlock chain relay. Input 2 and 3 require TTL logic levels, and inputs 4 and 5 require and external contact closure. Internal switches select which inputs are active Interlock master interconnections are shown in Figure 5. The lens uses two masters, one for water conductivity and the other for all interlocked conditions. The Conductivity Master controls the lens water purging system and also energizes one input of the General Master. The General Master provides the external interlock for the pulsed power supply. If lithium comes into contact with the cooling water, the conductivity master will trip. Output 2 of the Master shuts off the water circulating pump and initiates purging hardware, which isolates the lens from the water supply and allows inert gas to force remaining water from the lens into a reservoir located in the vault. Output 1 of the Master, which is connected to input 4 of the lens General Master, causes the General Master to trip and disable the pulsed power supply. All other lens alarm conditions (except conductivity) enter input 1 and 2 of the Lens General Master. An alarm condition from these inputs will disable the pulsed power supply, but the water system will remain on. Each interlock master has a manual Emergency Stop pushbutton (red) on its front panel. The pushbutton has alternating action, one push enabling the interlock master, the next push opening the interlock chain. all interlock masters are connected to an audible trip <b>alarm</b> <b>module</b> located in R 5 E- 6...|$|E

40|$|Smart {{computer}} algorithms and {{signal processing}} techniques {{have led to}} rapid development {{in the field of}} patient monitoring. Accelerated growth in the field of medical science has made data analysis more demanding and thus the complexity of decision-making procedures. Anaesthetists working in the operating theatre are responsible for carrying out a multitude of tasks which requires constant vigilance and thus a need for a smart decision support system has arisen. It is anticipated that such an automated decision support tool, capable of detecting pathological events can enhance the anaesthetist’s performance by providing the diagnostic information to the anaesthetist in an interactive and ergonomic display format. The main goal of this research was to develop a clinically useful diagnostic alarm system prototype for monitoring pathological events during anaesthesia. Several intelligent techniques, fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, a probabilistic alarms and logistic regression were explored for developing the optimum diagnostic modules in detecting these events. New real-time diagnostic algorithms were developed and implemented {{in the form of a}} prototype system called real time – smart alarms for anaesthesia monitoring (RT-SAAM). Three diagnostic modules based on, fuzzy logic (Fuzzy <b>Module),</b> probabilistic <b>alarms</b> (Probabilistic <b>Module)</b> and respiration induced systolic pressure variations (SPV Module) were developed using MATLABTM and LabVIEWTM. In addition, a new data collection protocol was developed for acquiring data from the existing S/ 5 Datex-Ohmeda anaesthesia monitor in the operating theatre without disturbing the original setup. The raw physiological patient data acquired from the S/ 5 monitor were filtered, pre-processed and analysed for detecting anaesthesia related events like absolute hypovolemia (AHV) and fall in cardiac output (FCO) using SAAM. The accuracy of diagnoses generated by SAAM was validated by comparing its diagnostic information with the one provided by the anaesthetist for each patient. Kappa-analysis was used for measuring the level of agreement between the anaesthetist’s and RT-SAAM’s diagnoses. In retrospective (offline) analysis, RT-SAAM that was tested with data from 18 patients gave an overall agreement level of 81 % (which implies substantial agreement between SAAM and anaesthetist). RT-SAAM was further tested in real-time with 6 -patients giving an agreement level of 71 % (which implies fair level of agreement). More real-time tests are required to complete the real-time validation and development of RT-SAAM. This diagnostic alarm system prototype (RT-SAAM) has shown that evidence based expert diagnostic systems can accurately diagnose AHV and FCO events in anaesthetized patients and can be useful in providing decision support to the anaesthetists...|$|R

Egress components are adequately sized and arranged, and occupant densities throughout the proposed floor plan allow for the fastest occupant movement based on the referenced literature. A performance based analysis has been conducted. Tenability was addressed with regards to visibility, exposure to carbon monoxide, temperature, and flashover conditions. Two design fire scenarios from the 2015 NFPA 101 : Life Safety Code were chosen. The first involved Design Fire Scenario 1, which was modeled as a trash bag fire in an office. Results of this study found that the ASET exceeded RSET. ASET was set by tenability criteria for visibility while RSET was found using hydraulic calculation methods for the compartment where the fire was located. The second fire scenario involved Design Fire Scenario 6, which was modeled by burning bookcases located in a bookstore. ASET exceeded RSET for this study as well. ASET was set by visibility criteria while RSET was set by a full building egress time calculation based on hydraulic calculation methods. Recommendations for improving life safety at the Student Center include: (1) monitoring special events to ensure that neither decorations nor implements impede the means of egress or introduce materials which present a severe fire hazard; (2) resizing an exit within the Bookstore to match a second exit so that occupants can clearly identify this exit as an alternate means of egress; (3) monitoring for any changes in how areas in the Student Center are used to ensure adequacy of exits and egress components; (4) Adding redundancy for the fire sprinkler water flow switch to fire <b>alarm</b> monitor <b>module</b> connection...|$|R

This thesis addresses the modularized design of a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump to be used within the context of the Medical Device Coordination Framework (MDCF), an open source framework under development by Kansas State University and the University of Pennsylvania that is informed by the Integrated Clinical Environment (ICE) specification managed by the MD PnP program and its collaborators. The thesis illustrates how to set up the MDCF development environment with Eclipse so that a developer can create software for both a remote MDCF console and a local PCA pump, where ICE channels are used for message transmission. Software development on the MDCF console side includes the development of apps that communicate with a local PCA pump through ICE channels and (b) the development of a GUI that can be launched from an MDCF console to configure, control, and monitor a PCA pump. Software development on the PCA pump side includes the creation of (a) ICE channels that can communicate with an MDCF console and (b) multiple threads for corresponding UART ports that support a modularized design. Several hardware modules were implemented to demonstrate the modularized design approach: an <b>alarm</b> <b>module,</b> a patient button module, a pump module, and a control panel module. These modules employ BeagleBone, Arduino, and MSP 430 boards. Status information is displayed on an MDCF console GUI, a PCA pump GUI, and a local LCD screen. An enhanced PCA pump or general medical sub-system with more modules can be developed using a similar method by connecting individual modules to UART ports and then creating the corresponding threads to support device-console communication...|$|E
