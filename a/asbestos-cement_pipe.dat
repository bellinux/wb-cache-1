Gravity sewers have been assembled from cast iron pipe, vitrified clay pipe, precast concrete pipe, <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>pipe,</b> and plastic pipe. While some older brickwork sewers remain in use, new sewers of diameters exceeding 1 m typically use reinforced concrete.

40|$|The {{aluminum}} {{concentration and}} Ryznar Index increased and the pH decreased {{in a small}} Appalachian water supply reservoir following acid precipitation runoff episodes. Concomitant increases in tapwater aluminum and decreases in tapwater pH were also observed at two homes in the water distribution system. Lead concentrations in the tapwater of one home frequently exceeded recommended levels, although spatial and temporal variation in tapwater copper and lead concentrations was considerable. Since source water and reservoir water copper and lead concentrations were much lower, the increased copper and lead concentrations in tapwater were attributed to corrosion of household plumbing. Tapwater copper concentration correlated well with tapwater pH and tapwater temperature. Asbestos fibers were not detected in tapwater. The <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>pipe</b> in the water distribution system was protected by a spontaneous metallic coating that inhibited fiber release from the pipe. Several simultaneous reactions were hypothesized to be {{taking place in the}} distribution system that involved corrosion of metallic components and coating of <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>pipe</b> components in part with corrosion products and in part by cations of watershed origin. Greater water quality changes might be expected in areas of higher atmospheric deposition...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Asbestos {{appears not}} {{to act as a}} potent gut {{carcinogen}} in humans or other animals. In humans it appears only so to act in those who have been occupationally exposed and who have swallowed substantial amounts of asbestos following inhalation. The amounts of asbestos naturally occurring in potable waters or added during the passage of such waters through <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>pipes</b> are so small that one would not expect them to induce gut cancer; all epidemiological studies are consistent with this view. THE PROBLEM IN THE light of our present knowledge this question resolves itself into two questions: Does the ingestion of asbestos lead to cancer of the gut or mesothelioma of the peritoneum? If so, does the use of <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>pipes</b> increase to any significant extent the asbestos content of potable waters passing through it? ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS In considering the first question {{it should be noted that}} human data are available; data obtained by animal experimentation are of limited value. Nonetheless, the anima...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} {{pressure}} management field {{studies have shown}} that the leakage exponent is often considerably higher than the theoretical orifice value of 0. 5. The first part of this paper identifies and analyses factors that may be responsible for the higher leakage exponents. Four factors are considered: leak hydraulics, pipe material behaviour, soil hydraulics and water demand. The second part of the paper presents the results of an experimental study with different pipe materials. The pipes used were taken from the field in Johannesburg or consisted of new pipes with artificially induced failures. The leakage exponents found were in the following ranges: • <b>Asbestos-cement</b> <b>pipe</b> with longitudinal crack 0. 78 – 1. 04 • Steel pipe with corrosion cluster 1. 90 – 2. 30 • Steel and uPVC Pipe with round hole 0. 52 • uPVC pipe with longitudinal crack 1. 50 – 1. 85 • uPVC pipe with circumferential crack 0. 40 – 0. 5...|$|E
40|$|The {{conference is}} briefly {{reviewed}} {{in the light}} of its impact on future regulatory decisions regarding the possible control of asbestos fiber in drinking water. The results of animal feeding studies indicate that asbestos fails to demonstrate toxicity in whole-animal lifetime exposures. The epidemiologic evidence of risk from ingestion of water containing asbestos fibers is not convincing, and in view of the lack of confirmation by animal studies, the existence of a risk has not been proven; however occupational gastrointestinal cancer may indicate ingestion risk. Whether or not there is a risk from asbestos in drinking water, however, common sense tells us to deal with an undesirable situation by employing means that are commonly and economically available. Well-known methods can minimize the presence of asbestos fibers in finished drinking water. In the case of natural fiber in raw water, standard or augmented filtration practices are extremely effective. If the source of asbestos fiber is <b>asbestos-cement</b> <b>pipe</b> that is being attacked by corrosive water, then, there is more than sufficient economic reason to correct the corrosivity of the water.

An analysis of covariance was run to test for differences in standard mortality ratios for seven cancer sites among three potential asbestos exposure groups based on AC pipe usage. Twelve variables representing nonexposure-related influences on disease rates were combined in four independent factors and used as covariates in these analyses.

The health hazards associated with inhalation of asbestos in the occupational environment have long been recognized including asbestosis, bronchial carcinoma, malignant mesothelioma of the pleura and peritoneum, and possibly cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and larynx.

RESULTS: The mean and median measured PCE concentrations in the water samples were 66 and 0. 5 μg/L, respectively, and the range extended from non-detectable to 2432 μg/L. The model-generated concentration estimates and water sample concentrations were moderately correlated (Spearman rank correlation coefficient = 0. 48, p < 0. 0001). Correlations were higher in samples taken at taps and spigots vs. hydrants (ρ = 0. 84 vs. 0. 34), in areas with simple vs. complex geometry (ρ = 0. 51 vs. 0. 38), and near pipes installed in 1973 – 1976 vs. other years (ρ = 0. 56 vs. 0. 42 for 1968 – 1972 and 0. 37 for 1977 – 1980). Overall, 24 % of the variance in measured PCE concentrations was explained by the model-generated concentration estimates (p < 0. 0001). Almost half of the water samples had undetectable concentrations of PCE. Undetectable levels were more common in areas with the earliest installed VL/AC pipes, at the beginning and middle of VL/AC pipes, at hydrants, and in complex pipe configurations. CONCLUSION: PCE concentration estimates generated using the Webler-Brown model were moderately correlated with measured water concentrations.

40|$|<b>Asbestos-cement</b> (Transite) <b>pipe</b> was {{installed}} at the Raft River Geothermal Area {{in the fall of}} 1975 and has been used extensively since. The pipe is used to transfer water from the well sites to the testing areas, reserve pits, and reinjection wells. The pipeline was designed to transport approximately 300 F water at 150 psi {{over a period of time}} for the present testing program and later, for the 5 MW(e) Raft River Pilot Plant. Numerous line failures have occurred since the original lines were installed. Due to the various causes of the line failures and the extensive downtime which has occurred because of them, further examination of Transite pipe is necessary to determine its future use as completion of the 5 MW(e) pilot plant approaches. The Conversion Technology and Engineering Branch has completed a preliminary study of the effects of S&I system transients on Transite pipe (re: OJD- 7 - 79).

40|$|The {{effect of}} water {{pressure}} in a pipe on {{the rate of}} leakage from holes in the pipe {{is one of the}} main factors influencing leakage and losses which is still not understood sufficiently. While the work that has been done on quantifying the relationship between pressure and leakage clearly illustrates the sensitivity of leakage to pressure and the potential reduction in losses due to pressure control, very little research on the underlying factors responsible for the observed results is evident. Using the methods of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) the project aims to find the relationship between the pressure in a pipe and the behaviour of the pipe material for different leak types. The study uses finite element analysis to understand what happens to a pipe when pressure is applied to a pipe with a leak opening e. g. a small hole, a longitudinal crack or a circumferential crack. The study also compares different pipe materials with these openings. The study focuses on uPVC <b>pipes,</b> steel <b>pipes,</b> <b>asbestos-cement</b> and cast iron pipes...|$|R
