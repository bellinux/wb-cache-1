5|$|A {{number of}} chronicles that mention Breton's death {{also note that}} he was the <b>author</b> of a legal {{treatise}} entitled le Bretoun, but this cannot be the surviving work called Britton, {{at least not in the}} current form, as that work discusses laws composed 15 years after Breton's death. It is unclear why he was credited with the work, and whether this attribution is just a confusion of Breton with the real <b>author</b> or if he did in fact <b>author</b> the work, which was later revised. The fact that the Britton is written in French, not Latin, and that it contains little information about the theory of law, being mostly concerned with the practical application of laws, points rather strongly to an <b>author</b> who was a royal justice, which Breton was.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we discuss how the concept of {{ontology}} can be beneficial for the <b>authoring</b> support of Web-based educational systems (WBES). We take a semantic perspective on the knowledge representation within such systems and explore the interoperability between the various ontological structures for domain and instructional modeling and the modeling of the entire <b>authoring</b> process. This work is based on previous research on modeling of application-oriented aspects within two existing web-based systems SmartTrainer [10] and AIMS [2]. <b>Authoring</b> Task Ontology (ATO) is envisioned as main driving mechanism in providing knowledge to the <b>authoring</b> tools and in enabling them to guide, support, navigate and check the consistency and completeness of the <b>authoring</b> activities {{at all levels of}} complexity. It provides operational semantics to the <b>authoring</b> process, by means of specification of <b>authoring</b> activities, sub-activities, goals and stages. In the construction of ATO we consider specification of top-level <b>authoring</b> activities, low-level <b>authoring</b> functions, decomposition of the <b>authoring</b> process in sequence of phases and decomposition of the <b>authoring</b> process in main activity modules (related to the educational system components). Further we present design principle of the ontology-based framework for <b>authoring</b> support of WBES. 1...|$|R

We then describe a selection of multimedia <b>authoring</b> environments within four different <b>authoring</b> paradigms: structured, timeline, graph and scripting.
