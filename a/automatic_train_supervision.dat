50|$|OS/2 {{was used}} in the London Underground Jubilee Line Extension Signals Control System (JLESCS) in London, UK. This control system {{delivered}} by Alcatel was in use from 1999 to 2011 i.e. between abandonment before opening of the line's unimplemented original <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> control system and the present SelTrac system. JLESCS did not provide <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> operation only manual <b>train</b> <b>supervision.</b> Six OS/2 local site computers were distributed along the railway between Stratford and Westminster, the shunting tower at Stratford depot, and several formed the central equipment located at Neasden.

50|$|It is {{possible}} to use <b>train</b> integrity <b>supervision,</b> or by accepting limited speed and traffic volume to lessen the effect and probability of colliding with detached rail vehicles. ERTMS Regional has lower commissioning and maintenance costs, since trackside train detection devices are not routinely used, and is suitable for lines with low traffic volume.

25|$|The <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Supervision</b> {{sub-system}} {{provides for}} headway management and proper interleaving of trains at junctions by speeding up or slowing down trains.

Its designers intended its function to be non-vital, and for this reason, the design is not fail-safe. At no point can the ATC system override the maximum speed limit enforced by the cab signal system.|$|E

A 380 MHz digital trunked TETRA radio communication system from Cassidian is used on all lines to carry both voice and data information. An integrated system comprising optical fibre cable, on-train radio, CCTV, and a centralised clock and public address system is used for telecommunication during train operations as well as emergencies.|$|R
25|$|The line used trip-stop wayside {{signaling}} for the Ashmont and Harvard branches {{until the}} mid-1980s, while the Braintree Branch {{was one of}} the earliest examples of Automatic Train Control (ATC). The Alewife Branch was built with ATC, at which point the remainder of the line was upgraded to ATC as well. The line was under local control at towers until 1985, when an electromechanical panel was completed at the 45 High Street control room. This was replaced in the late 1990s with a software-controlled <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Supervision,</b> using a product by Union Switch & Signal, subcontracted to Syseca Inc. (now ARINC), at a new control room at 45 High Street. Subsequent revisions to the system were made internally at the MBTA.|$|E
25|$|Automatic Train Operation {{controls}} trains so that, between stations, {{they will}} move {{at the speed}} specified by the automatic train protection and <b>automatic</b> <b>train</b> <b>supervision</b> sub-systems. All Metro trains are manned by train operators who work the doors, make station announcements, and supervise the train. The train operator also can control whether the train operates in automatic mode or manual mode. From November 17, 1995 until January 6, 1996, Metro management required its employees to use the automatic mode at all times. During the Blizzard of 1996, however, there was a collision on January 6 that occurred when the ATS system failed to pick up proper instructions from the wayside communication system during a snowstorm, and defaulted to the highest speed. This speed would have been safe during dry weather, but because of ice or snow, trains required additional stopping distance, which was not provided for by the ATC system. From the June 2009 collision until 2015, Metrorail operators operated the trains exclusively in manual mode; the ATC system was restored to the Red Line in 2015. The automatic train protection system still limits the maximum speed of every train that is in revenue service.|$|E
25|$|The New York City Subway uses {{a system}} known as <b>Automatic</b> <b>Train</b> <b>Supervision</b> (ATS) for {{dispatching}} and train routing on the A Division (the IRT Flushing Line, and the trains {{used on the}} , do not have ATS for two reasons: they are isolated from the main-line A Division, and they were already planned to get communications-based train control (CBTC) before the ATS on the A Division, or ATS-A, project had started). ATS allows dispatchers in the Operations Control Center (OCC) to see where trains are in real time, and whether each individual train is running early or late. Dispatchers can hold trains for connections, re-route trains, or short-turn trains to provide better service when a disruption causes delays. ATS is used to facilitate the installation of train arrival displays, which count down the number of minutes until a train arrives, on the A Division and on the BMT Canarsie Line. ATS was first proposed for the BMT Canarsie Line and the A Division in 1992, after a 1991 derailment killed five people on a 4 train that derailed near the 14th Street – Union Square station. CBTC for the Canarsie Line was proposed two years later.|$|E
