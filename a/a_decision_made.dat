5|$|A Project Leader {{is elected}} once per {{year by the}} developers. The leader has special powers, {{but they are not}} absolute, and {{appoints}} delegates to perform specialized tasks. Delegates make decisions as they think is best, taking into account technical criteria and consensus. By way of a General Resolution, the developers may recall the leader, reverse <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>made</b> by the leader or a delegate, amend foundational documents and make other binding decisions. The voting method is based on the Schulze method (Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping).|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Millionaire {{producers}} {{began work}} on a half-hour daily syndicated version of the show, with the idea being that it would serve as an accompaniment to the network series which was still in production. ABC's cancellation of the network Millionaire ended that idea; however, the syndicated Millionaire still had enough interest to be greenlit and BVT sold the series to local stations for the 2002–03 season. The syndicated series nearly met the same fate as its predecessor, however, {{due in part to}} worries that stemmed from <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>made</b> by one of its affiliates.|$|E

Involvement in illegal resistance activity was <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>made</b> by a minority of Belgians (approximately five percent of the population) but many more were involved in passive resistance. If captured, resistance members risked torture and execution, and around 17,000 were killed during the occupation.|$|E
5|$|The Jordan team's plan to {{introduce}} its new car, the EJ10B, at this race was postponed as its bodywork {{was required to}} undergo Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) safety tests.

However, {{this was the last}} race that the EJ10 competed, as the EJ10B made its début at the next race.|$|E
5|$|As the House of Councillors can veto <b>a</b> <b>{{decision}}</b> <b>made</b> by the House of Representatives, the House of Councillors {{can cause}} the House of Representatives to reconsider its decision. The House of Representatives however, can still insist on its decision by overwriting the veto by the House of Councillors with a two-thirds majority of its members present. Each year, and when required, the National Diet is convoked at the House of Councillors, {{on the advice of}} the Cabinet, for an extra or an ordinary session, by the Emperor. A short speech is, however, usually first made by the Speaker of the House of Representatives before the Emperor proceeds to convoke the Diet with his Speech from the throne.|$|E

5|$|Parken Stadium was {{selected}} as the official ground of the final, after <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>made</b> by the UEFA Executive Committee. It is located in the Indre Østerbro territory in Copenhagen; the site was once known as Idrætsparken, with the opening premiere held in 1911. It was the home of the Denmark national football team and Kjøbenhavns Boldklub's (KB) matches, until 1990, when the venue underwent reconstruction by the Danish lending company Baltica Finans A/S, with the former scrapped in favour of the new name, Parken Stadium. The concept was supported by the Danish Football Association with a contract that all of Denmark's national games would take place at the stadium for fifteen years. The price of the renovation was DKK640 million (£740 million). It made its debut two years later, in 1992, and has since then been the home base for F.C. Copenhagen's fixtures.|$|E
5|$|The {{year after}} he left office as mayor, Armstrong began work with the Edmonton post office. After being {{recommended}} for the position by city notables, he was named postmaster of the city on November 12, 1913. In the same year he oversaw {{the construction of a}} new building on Namayo Avenue, the Fairbairn Block, mainly for use by his business but with additional space for offices and housing in the upper levels. In 1920, Armstrong was involved in a legal case involving his office as postmaster when he was accused in the 1919 disappearance of a sum of $50,000 from the post office. Although exonerated in 1920, he would again be arrested in 1923 and charged with theft. During the trial, it was testified that a witness had seen Armstrong on the day of the robbery, with only a paper in his hand as if he were heading out. Armstrong, who had proclaimed his innocence, and provided evidence for the trial was eventually acquitted and found not guilty of the charges in <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>made</b> on May 29, which was followed by an eruption of applause. Later in 1923, Armstrong was appointed postmaster of the Strathcona (south side) Post Office. He remained with the post office until he retired in January 1937. At the time of his retirement he was serving as postmaster of the south post office. In his years with the post office, he served a total of 14 years as postmaster. The Armstrong Drug Store would later go through multiple owners until its closing on December 10, 1993.|$|E

25|$|The Avro 730 was an unswept canard design, making {{extensive}} use of stainless steel and powered {{by a total of}} four Armstrong Siddeley P.176 turbojet engines.

25|$|In 1965, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Free State of Bavaria, {{the state}} capital of Munich and the Deutsche Bundesbahn signed a {{contract}} {{on the construction of}} the Munich S-Bahn.
