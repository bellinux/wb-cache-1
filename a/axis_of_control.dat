A 2013 report published by the World Bank analysed the impact that the limited access to Area C lands and resources had on the Palestinian economy. While settlements represent a single <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> {{it is the largest}} with 68% of the Area C lands reserved for the settlements.

40|$|SummaryThe {{nematode}} C.  elegans is {{attracted to}} nutritious bacteria and is repelled by pathogens and toxins. Here {{we show that}} RNAi and toxin-mediated disruption of core cellular activities, including translation, respiration, and protein turnover, stimulate behavioral avoidance of normally attractive bacteria. RNAi {{of these and other}} essential processes induces expression of detoxification and innate immune effectors, {{even in the absence of}} toxins or pathogens. Disruption of core processes in non-neuronal tissues was sufficient to stimulate aversion behavior, revealing a neuroendocrine <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> that additionally required serotonergic and Jnk kinase signaling pathways. We propose that surveillance pathways overseeing core cellular activities allow animals to detect invading pathogens that deploy toxins and virulence factors to undermine vital host functions. Variation in cellular surveillance and endocrine pathways controlling behavior, detoxification, and immunity selected by past toxin or microbial interactions could underlie aberrant responses to foods, medicines, and microbes...|$|E

A way of improvement is by introducing information such as a player’s face or head into the system. We designed and implemented two game prototypes that apply real-time face position information as intrinsic elements of gameplay to enhance game experience. The first prototype augmented a typical motion-detection-based game. Face information was designed to enhance the sense of presence and role-playing. In the second prototype, face tracking is applied as a new <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> in a First Person Shooter (FPS) game. Although Face detection and tracking technology has started being utilized in game scenarios, there was little systematic research on how game experience is leveraged by applying face information to video games. The results of our user tests on comparing camera-based video games with and without face tracking demonstrated that using face position information can effectively enhance presence and role-playing. In addition, an intuitive control that augmented by face-tracking in the FPS game also got positive feedbacks from the test...|$|E

40|$|Neighborhood Components Analysis (NCA) is {{a popular}} method for {{learning}} a distance metric to be used within a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classifier. A key assumption built into the model is that each point stochastically selects a single neighbor, which makes the model well-justified only for kNN with k = 1. However, kNN classifiers with k> 1 are more robust and usually preferred in practice. Here we present kNCA, which generalizes NCA by learning distance metrics that are appropriate for kNN with arbitrary k. The main technical contribution is showing how to efficiently compute and optimize the expected accuracy of a kNN classifier. We apply similar ideas in an unsupervised setting to yield kSNE and kt-SNE, generalizations of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE, t-SNE) that operate on neighborhoods of size k, which provide an <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> over embeddings that allow for more homogeneous and interpretable regions.

40|$|Hemangioendotheliomas are {{classified}} as endothelial cell tumors, which {{are the most common}} soft tissue tumors in infants. In a murine model of hemangioendothelioma, we previously showed that MCP- 1 is required for its development and that the expression of MCP- 1 in EOMA cells is redox sensitive. Here, we sought to identify the source of oxidants that drive hemangioendothelioma formation. Seven known isoforms exist of the catalytic subunit gp 91. Only the nox- 4 isoform of gp 91 was present in EOMA cells, in contrast with non–tumor-forming murine endothelial cells that contained multiple forms of nox. Nox- 4 knockdown markedly attenuated MCP- 1 expression and hemangioendothelioma formation. We report that in EOMA cells, nox- 4 is localized such that it delivers H 2 O 2 to the nuclear compartment. Such delivery of H 2 O 2 causes oxidative modification of DNA, which can be detected in the urine of tumor-bearing mice as 8 -hydroxy- 2 -deoxyguanosine. Iron chelation by in vivo administration of deferoxamine improved tumor outcomes.

40|$|Regarding {{multiple}} spacecraft formation flying, {{the observation}} {{has been made}} that control thrust need only be applied coplanar to the local horizon to achieve complete controllability of a two-satellite (leader-follower) formation. A formulation of orbital dynamics using the state of one satellite relative to another is used. Without the need for thrust along the radial (zenith-nadir) axis of the relative reference frame, propulsion system simplifications and weight reduction may be accomplished. This work focuses on the validation of this control system on its own merits, and in comparison to a related system which does provide thrust along the radial axis of the relative frame. Maneuver simulations are performed using commercial ODE solvers to propagate the Keplerian dynamics of a controlled satellite relative to an uncontrolled leader. These short maneuver simulations demonstrate {{the capacity of the}} controller to perform changes from one formation geometry to another. Control algorithm performance is evaluated based on measures such as the fuel required to complete a maneuver and the maximum acceleration required by the controller. Based on this evaluation, the exclusion of the radial <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> still allows enough control authority to use Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) techniques to design a gain matrix of adequate performance over finite maneuvers.

The closure of MRL mouse ear pinna through-and-through holes provides a mammalian model of unusual wound healing/regeneration {{in which a}} blastema-like structure closes the ear hole and cartilage and hair follicles are replaced. Recent studies, based on a broad level of DNA damage and a cell cycle pattern of G 2 /M “arrest,” showed that p 21 Cip 1 /Waf 1 was missing from the MRL mouse ear and that a p 21 -null mouse could close its ear holes. Given the p 53 /p 21 <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> of DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and senescence, we tested the role of p 53 in the ear hole regenerative response. Using backcross mice, we found that loss of p 53 in MRL mice did not show reduced healing. Furthermore, cross sections of MRL. p 53 −/− mouse ears at 6 weeks post-injury showed an increased level of adipocytes and chondrocytes {{in the region of}} healing whereas MRL or p 21 −/− mice showed chondrogenesis alone in this same region, though at later time points. In addition, we also investigated other cell cyclerelated mutant mice to determine how p 21 was being regulated. We demonstrate that p 16 and Gadd 45 null mice show little healing capacity. Interestingly, a partial healing phenotype in mice with a dual Tgfβ/Rag 2 knockout mutation was seen. These data demonstrate an independence of p 53 signaling for mouse appendage regeneration and suggest that the role of p 21 in this process is possibly through the abrogation of the Tgfβ/Smad pathway...|$|E
40|$|Modified {{constraint}} {{induced movement}} therapy is {{a focus of}} rehabilitation research for stroke survivors with hemiplegia that relies on physically constraining a patient's unaffected limb to modify a patient's behavior and force {{the use of the}} affected limb in a rehabilitation setting. In this study, we attempt to cognitively induce a constraint in patients engaging in virtual therapy via a Kinect and Unity based platform. The platform included four games that each utilized a different active range of motion (ROM) exercise for control of game objects. Five stroke survivors with hemiparesis were recruited for a two week study consisting of five, 25 -minute therapy sessions each. Users were allowed to use either their unaffected or affected limb to play each game at any time and allowed their choice of games during each session. For each game, the difficulty level remained at baseline while the user used their affected side to play but the difficulty was increased at varying rates when the user used their unaffected side to play. Results were evaluated for compliance to the therapy (usage rate of affected side), choice of games, performance, efficacy of therapy (ROM), and qualitative behavior of users. Compliance during virtual mCIT seems to be higher than that of traditional mCIT but a more extensive user test is necessary to validate this result. ROM measurements did not provide a clear trend due to the small size and duration of the data set. Trends were found in several areas of user behavior: (1) users preferred games utilizing only one <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and not reliant on orientation of the limb, (2) users also tended to play games in a certain order, (3) user performance increased over time, and (4) users often incorrectly performed the desired active ROM exercise for each game which may indicate the necessity to observe and coach patients during virtual rehabilitation...|$|E

The method was tested using simulated data from a detailed GOCE system simulator.

For these corrections, use is made of a reference gravity field model. In addition, the rotational terms are derived from on-board star tracker observations. With a perfect a priori gravity field model and with the estimation of not only accelerometer biases but also accelerometer drifts, scale factors can be determined with an accuracy and stability better than 0. 01 for two of the three axes of each accelerometer, the exception being the axis pointing along the long <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the satellite (more or less coinciding with the flight direction) for which the scale factor estimates are unreliable.
