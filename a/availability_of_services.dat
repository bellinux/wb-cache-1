25|$|One {{complaint}} {{about both the}} U.S. and Canadian systems is waiting times, whether for a specialist, major elective surgery, such as hip replacement, or specialized treatments, such as radiation for breast cancer; wait times in each country are affected by various factors. In the United States, access is primarily determined by whether a person has access to funding to pay for treatment and by the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> {{in the area and}} by the willingness of the provider to deliver service at the price set by the insurer. In Canada, the wait time is set according to the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> in the area and by the relative need of the person needing treatment.|$|E
25|$|The {{reported}} {{increase is}} largely attributable {{to changes in}} diagnostic practices, referral patterns, <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> age at diagnosis, and public awareness. A widely cited 2002 pilot study concluded that the observed increase in autism in California cannot be explained by changes in diagnostic criteria, but a 2006 analysis found that special education data poorly measured prevalence because so many cases were undiagnosed, and that the 1994–2003 U.S. increase was associated with declines in other diagnostic categories, indicating that diagnostic substitution had occurred.|$|E
25|$|Through a {{retrospective}} analysis of national administrative data, the association between mortality and day of elective surgical procedure suggests a higher risk in procedures carried out later in the working week and on weekends. The odds of death were 44% and 82% higher respectively when comparing procedures on a Friday to a weekend procedure. This “weekday effect” has been postulated to be from several factors including poorer <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> on a weekend, and also, decrease number and level of experience over a weekend.|$|E

40|$|GLONASS {{has been}} {{proposed}} as an augmentation to GPS/LAAS. We examine the incremental benefits of the additional signals from GLONASS to the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> for precision approaches. The methodology used for the modeling <b>of</b> <b>availability</b> {{is the same as}} that adopted previously for the analysis of GPS/LAAS. The inclusion of GLONASS signals requires provision for adapting the models of measurement errors to account for the differences between GPS and GLONASS. The main difference of significance to LAAS is due to the frequency division multiple access scheme used by GLONASS, and the resultant inter-frequency biases in the measurements. The errors introduced by such biases at the reference and user receivers are uncorrelated, and have to be accounted for in the error models. As expected, the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> improves considerably with the additional ranging sources. The combined GPS and GLONASS signals provide consistent and robust performance with high levels <b>of</b> <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> for the most demanding precision approaches.

On November 18, 2004, however, the CRTC approved an application by cable companies to offer Fox News Channel on the digital cable tier. Fox commenced broadcasting in Canada shortly thereafter.|$|E
500|$|Although {{intended}} to increase {{public confidence in}} vaccinations, the decision to remove thiomersal instead led to some parents suspecting thiomersal {{as a cause of}} autism. This concern over a vaccine-autism link grew from a confluence of several underlying factors. First, methylmercury had for decades been the subject of widespread environmental and media concern after two highly publicized episodes of poisonings in the 1950s and 1960s in Minamata Bay, Japan from industrial waste and in the 1970s in Iraq from fungicide contamination of wheat. These incidents led to new research on methylmercury safety and culminated in the publication of an array of confusing recommendations by public health agencies in the 1990s warning against methylmercury exposure in adults and pregnant women, which ensured a continued high public awareness of mercury toxicity. Second, the vaccine schedule for infants expanded in the 1990s to include more vaccines, some of which, including the Hib vaccine, DTaP vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine, could have contained thiomersal. Third, the number of diagnoses of autism grew in the 1990s, leading parents of these children to search for an explanation for the apparent rise in diagnoses, including considering possible environmental factors. The dramatic increase in reported cases of autism during the 1990s and early 2000s is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> age at diagnosis, and public awareness, and it is unknown whether autism's true prevalence increased during the period. Nevertheless, some parents believed that there was a growing [...] "autism epidemic" [...] and connected these three factors to conclude that the increase in number of vaccines, and specifically the mercury in thiomersal in those vaccines, was causing a dramatic increase in the incidence of autism.|$|E
2500|$|Telecommunications are {{regulated}} by the Telecommunications Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (TATT). It has successfully de-monopolised the industry, granting several new mobile licenses in 2005 for two private companies, Digicel and Laqtel to offer wireless service in competition with TSTT. Laqtel which would have offered Trinidad and Tobago's first CDMA (3G) network had its license revoked by the TATT in 2008. Fixed-line telephone service and broadband was also once a monopoly controlled by Telecommunications Services of Trinidad and Tobago (TSTT). Flow, the monopoly cable provider, also now offers these services to its wide customer base. [...] Satellite, Wifi, EDGE, GPRS, DSL and Cable broadband services in excess of 6 Mbit/s are available throughout the city.

40|$|<b>Availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> in many {{wireless}} networks {{depends on}} the ability for network users {{to establish and maintain}} communication channels using control messages from base stations and other users. An adversary with knowledge of the underlying communication protocol can mount an efficient denial <b>of</b> <b>service</b> attack by jamming the communication channels used to exchange control messages. The use of spread spectrum techniques can deter an external adversary from such control channel jamming attacks. However, malicious colluding insiders or an adversary who captures or compromises system users are not deterred by spread spectrum, as they know the required spreading sequences. For the case of internal adversaries, we propose a framework for control channel access schemes using the random assignment of cryptographic keys to hide the location of control channels. We propose and evaluate metrics to quantify the probabilistic <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> under control channel jamming by malicious or compromised users and show that the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> degrades gracefully as the number of colluding insiders or compromised users increases. We propose an algorithm called GUIDE for the identification of compromised users in the system based on the set of control channels tha...|$|R

40|$|Today, {{internet}} and web services have become an inseparable part of our lives. Hence, ensuring continuous <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> has become imperative {{to the success of}} any organization. But these services are often hampered by constant threats from myriad types of attacks. One such attack is called distributed denial <b>of</b> <b>service</b> attack that results in issues ranging from temporary slowdown of servers to complete non-availability <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> Honeypot, which is a sort of a trap, can be used to interact with potential attackers to deflect, detect or prevent such attacks and ensure continuous <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> This paper gives insights into the problems posed by distributed denial <b>of</b> <b>service</b> attacks, existing solutions that use honeypots and how a mesh of virtualized honeypots can be used to prevent distributed denial <b>of</b> <b>service</b> attacks.
