5|$|His {{younger brother}} William {{was born in}} 1927. Their father came from Kentucky and managed a dairy. Charles Keating Sr. lost a leg in a hunting accident, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> into a long decline from Parkinson's disease around 1931, and was nursed by his wife {{until his death in}} 1964.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{began his}} {{presidency}} with approval ratings near 50percent. After the September 11 attacks, Bush gained an approval rating of 90percent, maintaining 80 to 90percent approval {{for four months}} after the attacks. It remained over 50percent during most of his first term <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> to as low as 19percent in his second term.|$|E
5|$|Flooding {{returned}} {{in the winter}} of early 1890, when the river first rose very quickly <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> very quickly. Portland's main street was completely submerged, communication over the Cascades was cut off, and many rail lines were forced to shut down. In 1894, another major flood occurred on the Willamette, and although it too caused huge damage, it was not as large as that of 1861.|$|E

5|$|Harvard had cruised to a 91 {{record in}} conference play <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> to 72 Princeton on March 1. The {{following}} night, Princeton defeated Dartmouth and Harvard lost to Penn to give Princeton {{the lead in}} the conference race. Harvard earned the Ivy League Championship with wins on March 8 and 9 over Columbia and Cornell to finish at 113 in conference as Princeton was swept on the same nights to Yale and Brown to fall to 94 in conference.|$|E
5|$|John Hick {{published}} Evil and the God of Love in 1966, {{in which}} he developed a theodicy {{based on the work}} of Irenaeus. Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, based on human development. Hick framed his theodicy as an attempt to respond to the problem of evil in light of scientific development, such as Darwin's theory of evolution, and as an alternative to the traditionally accepted Augustinian theodicy. Rejecting the idea that humans were created perfectly <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> away from perfection, Hick instead argued that humans are still in the process of creation. He interpreted the fall of man, described in the book of Genesis, as a mythological description of the current state of humans.|$|E
5|$|Another command change {{occurred}} on June 22. In addition to Pemberton at his front, Grant {{had to be}} concerned with Confederate forces in his rear under the command of Joseph E. Johnston. He stationed one division {{in the vicinity of the}} Big Black River Bridge and another reconnoitered as far north as Mechanicsburg, both to act as a covering force. By June 10, the IX Corps, under Maj. Gen. John G. Parke, was transferred to Grant's command. This corps became the nucleus of a special task force whose mission was to prevent Johnston, gathering his forces at Canton, from interfering with the siege. Sherman was given command of this task force and Brig. Gen. Frederick Steele replaced him at the XV Corps. Johnston eventually began moving to relieve Pemberton and reached the Big Black River on July 1, but he delayed a potentially difficult encounter with Sherman until it was too late for the Vicksburg garrison, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> back to Jackson. Sherman would eventually pursue Johnston and (re)capture Jackson on July 17.|$|E
60|$|He stopped abruptly, swayed {{a moment}} to <b>and</b> fro, <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> heavily forward with {{his head on the}} bosom of his friend.|$|R

5|$|In the meantime, on the Union right, Lew Wallace {{formed an}} attacking column with three brigades—one {{from his own}} division, one from McClernand's, and one from Smith's—to try {{to regain control of}} ground lost in the battle that morning. Wallace's old brigade (11th Indiana and 8th Missouri), now {{commanded}} by Col. Morgan. Wall L. Smith, and others from McClernand's and Wallace's divisions were chosen to lead the attack. The brigades of Cruft (Wallace's Division) and Leonard F. Ross (McClernand's Division) were placed in support on the flanks. Wallace ordered the attack forward. Smith, the 8th Missouri, and the 11th Indiana advanced a short distance up the hill using Zouave tactics, where the men repeatedly rushed <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> to the ground in a prone position. By 5:30p.m. Wallace's troops had succeeded in retaking the ground lost that morning, and by nightfall, the Confederate troops had been driven back to their original positions. Grant began plans to resume his assault in the morning, although neglecting to close the escape route that Pillow had opened.|$|E
5|$|On {{the left}} {{flank of the}} attack, Brockenbrough's brigade was devastated by {{artillery}} fire from Cemetery Hill. They were also subjected to a surprise musket fusillade from the 8th Ohio Infantry regiment. The 160 Ohioans, firing from a single line, so surprised Brockenbrough's Virginians—already demoralized by their losses to artillery fire—that they panicked and fled back to Seminary Ridge, crashing through Trimble's division and causing many of his men to bolt as well. The Ohioans followed up with a successful flanking attack on Davis's brigade of Mississippians and North Carolinians, which was now the left flank of Pettigrew's division. The survivors were subjected to increasing artillery fire from Cemetery Hill. More than 1,600 rounds were fired at Pettigrew's men during the assault. This portion of the assault never advanced much farther than the sturdy fence at the Emmitsburg Road. By this time, the Confederates were close enough to be fired on by artillery canister and Alexander Hays' division unleashed very effective musketry fire from behind 260 yards of stone wall, with every rifleman of the division lined up {{as many as four}} deep, exchanging places in line as they fired <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> back to reload.|$|E
25|$|The bullet {{trajectory}} {{proposed by}} the police suggested that a bullet struck the windshield, entered Lu's knee, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> out. Another bullet fired from the Jeep's side struck Chen's stomach and traveled through his jacket and lodged {{in the rear of}} the jacket until recovered by the hospital staff.|$|E

25|$|The {{census of}} 1801 records there were 121 {{inhabitants}} in 24 families living in 21 houses in Hawridge. According to the subsequent censuses the population grew rapidly between 1801 and 1861 {{when it was}} 276 <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> back by 1901 to just 209. By 1931 it had again increased to 222.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{was halted}} on June 11, 2013, after a {{mechanic}} {{working on an}} elevator {{was struck by a}} counterweight <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> down the shaft to his death. Work resumed two days later after officials from the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal/OSHA) declared the site safe, but as of October 2013, the accident remained under investigation.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{a variety}} of {{official}} sources and extrapolating from figures for England alone, Ceri Peach estimates that {{the number of people in}} Britain born in the West Indies grew from 15,000 in 1951, to 172,000 in 1961 and 304,000 in 1971, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> slightly to 295,000 in 1981. He estimates the population of West Indian ethnicity in 1981 to be between 500,000 and 550,000.|$|E
25|$|Yallop's {{first summer}} in South Africa was not successful. Vice captain to Kim Hughes he began well with tour game scores of 35 <b>and</b> 62, <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> away: 6, 7, and 26.|$|R

25|$|The Dorado Airport was {{operated}} from 1942 to 1996. The airport {{began as}} a military landing strip, then became a civilian airport in the 1960s with Caribair and Dorado Wings flights operating until 1980 and 1982 respectively. The airport operated as a private landing strip throughout the 1980s <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> into disrepair. In 1996, the airport was rezoned as residential land and redeveloped.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, {{the number}} of {{registered}} crime was 1.84 million. This figure increased to 2.8 million in 1993, then fell slightly. In 1996, there were a total of 2.63 million officially registered crimes, which was more than 40% higher than in 1990. In 1999, total reported crime was 3 million, and it continued to increase in 2000 and 2001, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Two Balkan Wars, in 1912 and 1913, {{involved}} {{further action}} against the Ottoman Empire in Europe. The Balkan League first conquered Macedonia and most of Thrace from the Ottoman Empire, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> out over {{the division of the}} spoils. Albania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912, after several rebellions and uprisings. This reduced Turkey's possessions in Europe (Rumelia) to their present borders in Eastern Thrace.|$|E

25|$|The most {{commonly}} accepted hypothesis for the battle (epic {{as described by}} later Christian Asturian sources, but a mere skirmish in Muslim texts) is that the Moorish column was attacked from the cliffs <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> back through the valleys towards present day Gijón, but it was attacked in retreat by the retinue and nearly destroyed. However, the only near contemporary chronicler accounting for {{the events of the}} time, the Christian Chronicle of 754, makes no mention of the incident.|$|E
25|$|Having {{made his}} way into Freyja's chambers, Loki looked around {{to be sure that}} no one was awake, and found that Freyja was asleep. He landed on her bed and noticed that she was wearing the necklace, the clasp turned downward. Loki turned into a flea and jumped onto Freyja's cheek and there bit her. Freyja stirred, turning about, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> asleep again. Loki removed his flea's shape and undid her collar, opened the bower, and {{returned}} to Odin.|$|E
25|$|The ovarian {{width of}} gynes {{increased}} from April to July which {{is within the}} overwintering period. From July through August, mean ovarian width of overwintering females increased sharply, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>fell</b> between late August and September. The percent of gynes with mature oocytes in their ovaries increased from 2.9% in April to 15.6% {{at the end of}} July, and then lastly to 45.7% in August. Female wasps with larger ovaries are more likely to lay eggs. Workers have thin, inactive ovaries that prevent them from ovipositing.|$|E
