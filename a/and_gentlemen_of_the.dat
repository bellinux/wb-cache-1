His plays may be grouped into four main categories: acts, or devotional plays; comedies tragicomedies; and farces.|$|E

25|$|Bury {{was born}} in Radcliffe-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, in 1836, where his father was the vicar.

Frederick Bury made his debut for Demerara in what was retrospectively considered the inaugural first-class match in the West Indies, played against Barbados at the Garrison Savannah, Bridgetown, in February 1865. In that match, he opened the batting with Calvin Gilbert in each innings, but scored only seven runs across two innings as Demerara was dismissed for 22 and 38 – no Demeraran made double figures. Bury took two wickets in Barbados' innings of 74 and 124, with Barbados winning the match by 138 runs.|$|E
500|$|The nativity scene may not {{accurately}} reflect gospel events. [...] With {{no basis in}} the gospels, for example, the shepherds, the Magi, and the ox and ass may be displayed together at the manger. [...] Some traditions bring other scriptural characters to the nativity scene such as Adam and Eve and the serpent, Noah and his animals, the twelve sons of Jacob, the twelve prophets and the twelve apostles. [...] Mundane activities such as Mary washing diapers in the River Jordan, or a dove descending on the newborn infant may be depicted. The art form {{can be traced back}} to eighteenth-century Naples, Italy. Neapolitan nativity scenes do not represent Palestine at the time of Jesus but the life of the Naples of 1700, during the Bourbon period. Families competed with each other to produce the most elegant and elaborate scenes and so, next to the Child Jesus, to the Holy Family and the shepherds, were placed ladies <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nobility, representatives of the bourgeoisie of the time, vendors with their banks and miniatures of cheese, bread, sheep, pigs, ducks or grape, and typical figures of the time like gypsy predicting the future, people playing cards, housewives doing shopping, dogs, cats and chickens.|$|E
2500|$|Humbert Humbert's first love, Annabel Leigh, {{is named}} after the [...] "maiden" [...] in the poem [...] "Annabel Lee" [...] by Poe; this poem is alluded to {{many times in the}} novel, and its lines are {{borrowed}} to describe Humbert's love. A passage in chapter 11 reuses [...] Poe's phrase ...by the side of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride. In the opening of the novel, the phrase Ladies <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jury, exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied, is a pastiche of two passages of the poem, the winged seraphs of heaven (line 11), and The angels, not half so happy in heaven, went envying her and me (lines 21–2). Nabokov originally intended Lolita to be called The Kingdom by the Sea, drawing on the rhyme with Annabel Lee that was used in the first verse of Poe's work. A variant of this line is reprised in the opening of chapter one, which reads ...had I not loved, one summer, an initial girl-child. In a princedom by the sea.|$|E

2500|$|The {{introduction}} of Italian poetry, especially that of Petrarch, into the peninsula {{led to a}} revival of Castilian verse, which dominated Portugal throughout the fifteenth century. Constable Dom Pedro, friend of the Marquis of Santillana, wrote almost entirely in Castilian and is the first representative of the Castilian influence which imported from Italy the love of allegory and reverence for classical antiquity. The court poetry of some three hundred knights <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time of Afonso V and John II is contained in the [...] "Cancioneiro Geral", compiled by Resende and inspired by Juan de Mena, Jorge Manrique, and other Spaniards. The subjects of these mostly artificial verses are love and satire. Among the few that reveal special talent and genuine poetical feeling are Resende's lines {{on the death of}} Inês de Castro, the [...] "Fingimento de Amores" [...] of Diogo Brandão, and the [...] "Coplas" [...] of D.

2500|$|The {{new ground}} {{was ready for}} use in 1809 and so Lord had two grounds at his {{disposal}} for the 1809 and 1810 seasons. The North Bank ground was sub-let to St John's Wood Cricket Club, which eventually merged with MCC. Lord officially took over his second ground on 8 May 1811 by literally re-laying there his turf from the Old Ground. He did this so that [...] "the noblemen <b>and</b> <b>gentlemen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MCC {{should be able to}} play on the same footing as before". According to Warner, however, the relocation was unpopular with many MCC members and, as a result, the club played no matches there in either 1811 or 1812. This may have been so but cricket generally was in decline at the time because of the Napoleonic Wars. The Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians (the ACS) holds that [...] "(from) 1810 to 1814 the game was all but dead", largely because of the war and [...] "the very real threat of civil unrest in England". The second venue is now generally known as Lord's Middle Ground. In the three years that Lord controlled it, only six matches are known to have taken place there and just three of these (all in 1813) involved MCC. The Middle Ground's exact location is uncertain but it is understood to have been in North Bank {{at the north end of}} Lisson Grove and that the Regent's Canal has been cut through it. This means that it was partially on the canal route and somewhere in the area now bounded by Lisson Grove (the B507) to south-west, Lodge Road to north-west, Park Road (the A41) to north-east and the Regent's Canal to south-east. It was less than 300 metres from the site of the modern Lord's ground.|$|E
