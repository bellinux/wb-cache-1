5|$|When Eva {{was a year}} old, Duarte {{returned}} permanently to {{his legal}} family, leaving Juana Ibarguren <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>children</b> in penury. Ibarguren <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>children</b> were forced {{to move to the}} poorest area of Junín. Los Toldos was a village in the dusty region of Las Pampas, with a reputation as a desolate place of abject poverty. To support herself <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>children,</b> Ibarguren sewed clothes for neighbors. The family was stigmatized by the abandonment of the father and by the illegitimate status of the children under Argentine law, and was consequently somewhat isolated. A desire to expunge this part of her life might have been a motivation for Eva to arrange the destruction of her original birth certificate in 1945.|$|E

5|$|Historically, among certain Asian and Native American {{cultures}} {{the family}} structure {{consisted of a}} grandmother <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>children,</b> especially daughters, who raised their own children together and shared child care responsibilities.

Romantic relationships {{between men and women}} were formed and dissolved with little impact on the children who remained in the mother's extended family.|$|E

5|$|John of Fordun {{wrote that}} Duncan's wife fled Scotland, taking her children, {{including}} the future kings Malcolm III (Máel Coluim mac Donnchada) and Donald III (Domnall Bán mac Donnchada, or Donalbane) with her.

William Robertson proposes the safest place for Duncan's widow <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>children</b> would be with her or Duncan's kin and supporters in Atholl.|$|E
5|$|Kamadhenu-Surabhi's {{residence}} varies {{depending on}} different scriptures.

The pleased god conferred goddess-hood on the cow and decreed that all people would worship her <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>children</b> – cows. He also gave her a world called Goloka, while her daughters would reside on earth among humans.|$|E
5|$|Pauline Fowler {{is one of}} the {{original}} twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland (1940–2007) and Julia Smith (1927–1997). Holland had drawn on his own London background for inspiration, naming three of {{the original}} characters after his own relatives, specifically his aunt Lou <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>children,</b> Holland's cousins, the fraternal twins Pete and Pauline. This family setup of a woman named Lou Beale, with twin children Pete and Pauline, was recreated on-screen as the first family of EastEnders, the Beales and Fowlers.|$|E

5|$|After Johnson's {{death in}} 1774, Brant <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>children</b> left Johnson Hall in Johnstown, New York and {{returned}} to her native village of Canajoharie, further west on the Mohawk River. A Loyalist during the American Revolutionary War, she migrated to British Canada, where she served as an intermediary between British officials and the Iroquois. After the war, she settled in what is now Kingston, Ontario. In recognition of her service to the Crown, the British government gave Brant a pension and compensated her for her wartime losses, including a grant of land. When the British ceded their former colonial territory to the United States, most of the Iroquois nations were forced out of New York. A Six Nations Reserve was established in what is now Ontario.|$|E
5|$|After {{completion}} of the palace, Hunt remained at Alupka working on an assortment of projects {{in and around the}} estate building long carriage drives, roads and structural improvements to the gardens surrounding the palace. One of his largest projects was an extension to the palace itself, the Shuvalov wing, which was to be the summer retreat of the Vorontsov's daughter Countess Sofia Shuvalova <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>children,</b> the countess was estranged from her husband This wing linked the palace to the western gatehouse, and created the enclosed Shuvalov Passage leading to the main entrance. Hunt remained in the Prince's employ until his retirement in 1852.|$|E
5|$|Allan Ramsay (1713–84) {{studied in}} Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh, where he {{established}} himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility. He undertook portraits of many of the major figures of the Scottish Enlightenment, including his friend the philosopher David Hume and the visiting Jean-Jacques Rousseau. After a second visit to Italy he moved to London in 1757 and from 1761 he was Principal Painter in Ordinary to George III. He now focused on royal portraits, often presented by the king to ambassadors and colonial governors, but also more intimate works like that of Queen Charlotte <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>Children</b> (c. 1755). His work has been seen as anticipating the Grand Manner of Joshua Reynolds, but many of his early portraits, particularly of women, are less formal and more intimate studies.|$|E

5|$|Around this time, Thomas {{developed}} {{an interest in}} archaeology, entomology, and ornithology, as well as drawing. In 1913 his family made plans for him to join the Royal Navy, although he failed the entrance exam due to alleged poor eyesight. At {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, Lethbridge was sent to Wellington College in Berkshire, while his mother and siblings moved to Buckhurst in Wokingham, Berkshire. In February 1919 Violet <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>children</b> moved to Manor House in Finchampstead, where Jacintha and Bill became seriously ill {{as a result of a}} flu pandemic; the former survived but Bill died in March.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rhetoric}} grew more strident, however, the other monarchies started to view events with alarm. In 1790, Leopold succeeded his brother Joseph as emperor and by 1791, he {{considered}} the situation surrounding his sister, the French Queen Marie Antoinette, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>children,</b> with greater and greater alarm. In August 1791, in consultation with French émigré nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, he issued the Declaration of Pilnitz, in which they declared {{the interest of the}} monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis and his family. They threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family.|$|E
5|$|Caracalla's mother Julia Domna was {{initially}} left in peace when Macrinus became emperor.

Afterwards, Macrinus sent Domna's sister Julia Maesa <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>children</b> back to Emesa in Syria, from where Maesa set in motion her plans to have Macrinus overthrown. Macrinus remained in Antioch {{instead of going to}} Rome upon being declared emperor, a step which furthered his unpopularity in Rome and contributed to his eventual downfall.|$|E

5|$|Charles trusted Isabeau {{enough by}} 1402 {{to allow her}} to {{arbitrate}} the growing dispute between the Orléanists and Burgundians, and he turned control of the treasury over to her. After Philip the Bold died in 1404 and his son John the Fearless became Duke of Burgundy, the new duke continued the political strife in an attempt {{to gain access to the}} royal treasury for Burgundian interests. Orléans and the royal dukes thought John was usurping power for his own interests and Isabeau, at that time, aligned herself with Orléans to protect the interests of the crown <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>children.</b> Furthermore, she distrusted John the Fearless who she thought overstepped himself in rank—he was cousin to the King whereas Orléans was Charles' brother.|$|E

The marriage was not happy, inducing her to live separately from her husband, who died in the house of another woman in 1876. From the 1850s Sofia <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>children</b> used Alupka as a country retreat, occupying the long West Wing now named after them, the Shuvalov Wing, while her brother Prince Semyon occupied the remainder of the palace.|$|E
