From the spatial distribution, their collimation and the individual shapes of the bow shocks, we suggest possible candidates for the outflow sources. Most of the candidate driving sources are deeply embedded in dense cores of the molecular cloud. A very young outflow arises from the newly discovered Class 0 source MMS 126.

40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that the ionosphere, because it acts as {{a significant source of}} plasma, plays a critical role in ring current dynamics. However, because the ring current deposits energy into the ionosphere, the inverse may also be true: the ring current can {{play a critical role in}} the dynamics of ionospheric outflow. This study uses a set of coupled, first‐principles‐based numerical models to test the dependence of ionospheric outflow on ring current‐driven region 2 field‐aligned currents (FACs). A moderate magnetospheric storm event is modeled with the Space Weather Modeling Framework using a global MHD code (Block Adaptive Tree Solar wind Roe‐type Upwind Scheme, BATS‐R‐US), a polar wind model (Polar Wind Outflow Model), and a bounce‐averaged kinetic ring current model (ring current atmosphere interaction model with self‐consistent magnetic field, RAM‐SCB). Initially, each code is two‐way coupled to all others except for RAM‐SCB, which receives inputs from the other models but is not allowed to feed back pressure into the MHD model. The simulation is repeated with pressure coupling activated, which drives strong pressure gradients and region 2 FACs in BATS‐R‐US. It is found that the region 2 FACs increase heavy ion outflow by up to 6 times over the noncoupled results. The <b>additional</b> <b>outflow</b> further energizes the ring current, establishing an ionosphere‐magnetosphere mass feedback loop.

40|$|There {{are already}} {{numerous}} instances {{around the world}} where river mouths are classified as seasonally open. In the case of tidal inlets where river flow provides the erosive power necessary to maintain the opening increasing irrigation and water usage may lead to situations where previously stable inlets will also tend towards seasonal closure. En~gineers and managers therefore, will need predictive tools to determine appropriate strategies to reduce or prevent total closure. This paper gives details of a statistically based model that has been developed {{to deal with a}} complex river-dominated tidal inlet. The model has been applied to a study of the River Murray mouth in Australia with a view to assessing the likely causes of closure and the management options that are available to prevent closure. The study used recorded water level data collected at sites outside and inside the mouth to derive a model of the mouth behavior and to relate this to river flow. The model was then used to assess two management options, on the assumption that additional flow could be made available. One option delivered a flushing flow over a month each year while the second provided a more constant increase in flow over the whole year. The key issue was to determine which option led to a better mouth opening. The main conclusion of the modeling work is that a previously suggested strategy of a large flushing flow over a month is likely to be less effective than providing a more constant <b>additional</b> <b>outflow.</b> This has significant implications for the river managers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} a modification of the composite sequential femorocrural bypass graft that we adopted in 1985, a retrospective case-note study was undertaken. The grafts combined a prosthetic femoropopliteal section with a popliteal to crural section with autologous vein, linked via a common intermediate anastomosis sited on the above-knee popliteal artery. Patients and Methods: Between 1985 and 2000, 68 grafts of this type were constructed in 65 patients with critical ischemia of the lower limb and insufficient autologous vein for construction of an all venous bypass. Reasons for insufficient long saphenous vein included previous lower limb bypass in 33 cases, phlebitis in 16 cases, venous hypoplasia in eight cases, and previous varicose vein surgery in seven cases. Distal anastomoses were carried out to the peroneal artery in 26 cases, the anterior tibial artery in 17 cases, the posterior tibial artery in 17 cases, and the pedal arteries in eight cases. Sources of vein included the long saphenous vein in 26 cases, the arm vein in 38 cases, and the short saphenous vein in two cases. In 22 limbs (32 %), angiography had shown an occluded segment of above-knee popliteal artery, and in these cases, local popliteal disobliteration was performed to receive the composite anastomosis and to provide <b>additional</b> <b>outflow.</b> Results: The 2 -year cumulative primary patency, secondary patency, and limb salvage rates were 68 %, 73 %, and 75 %, respectively. Localized popliteal disobliteration did not compromise graft patency (P =. 07, with log-rank test). Conclusion: In the absence of sufficient autologous vein, patients needing bypass to crural arteries can be offered reconstruction with composite sequential grafting with satisfactory results. Furthermore, an occluded above-knee popliteal segment is not a contraindication for composite sequential bypass reconstruction. (J Vasc Surg 2002; 36 : 772 - 8. ...|$|R

Certainly, an important role is played by the increase of concentrations of malic, citric, and tartaric acids, which were closer to those commonly found in NGM. At lower concentrations of these acids, glucose was not exhausted and the fermentation became stuck. Only the combination of 3  g/l malic acid, 0.3  g/l citric acid, and 3  g/l tartaric acid led to synthetic must fermentation up to dryness (< 2  g/l residual sugar). Previous results may explain {{the effect of these}} weak acids.

In this study, the authors investigated {{the applicability of}} islanded and nonislanded perforator-based interposition flaps as a technique for release of scar contracture. Methods: Patients requiring surgery for scar contracture release were included. Preoperatively, a suitable perforator was identified by color Doppler sonography. The flap design was tailored according to the localization of this perforator and the anticipated defect. Flap measurements were obtained intraoperatively and at follow-up. Supple scar tissue {{was included in the}} flap design when necessary, to increase the applicability of this concept in extensively burned patients. Flaps were converted into island flaps on indication to circumvent significant kinking of the flap base and compromised tissue perfusion. Results: Twenty-two flaps were performed, of which four were converted into island flaps. All flaps survived, but in four cases necrosis of the tip was observed. After a mean follow-up of 7. 8 months, the width and surface area of the flaps had expanded to 123 percent (range, 40 to 311 percent) and 116 percent (range, 60 to 246 percent), respectively. One flap was converted into a full-thickness graft during the initial operation.

The FUSE spectrum showed that an <b>additional</b> BAL <b>outflow</b> with V_max ~ 6000 km s^- 1 and FWHM ~ 3400 km s^- 1 had appeared. WPVS 007 is a low-luminosity object in which such a high velocity outflow is not expected; therefore, it is an outlier on the M_V/V_max relationship. Template spectral fitting yielded apparent ionic columns, and a Cloudy analysis showed {{that the presence of}} PV requires a high ionization parameter log(U) >= 0 and high column density log(N_H) >= 23 assuming solar abundances and a nominal SED for low-luminosity NLS 1 s with alpha_ox=- 1. 28. A recent long Swift observation revealed the first hard X-ray detection and an intrinsic (unabsorbed) alpha_ox ~ - 1. 9 $. Using this SED in our analysis yielded lower column density constraints (log(N_H) >= 22. 2 for Z= 1, or log(N_H) >= 21. 6 if Z= 5). The X-ray weak continuum, combined with X-ray absorption consistent with the UV lines, provides the best explanation for the observed Swift X-ray spectrum. The large column densities and velocities implied by the UV data in any of these scenarios could be problematic for radiative acceleration. We also point out that since the observed PV absorption can be explained by lower total column densities using an intrinsically X-ray weak spectrum, we might expect to find PV absorption preferentially more often (or stronger) in quasars that are intrinsically X-ray weak.

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} the long-term outflow pathway mechanisms after deep sclerectomy - when collagen implant is resorbed - using ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). METHODS: Forty-three eyes of 32 patients with medically uncontrolled open-angle glaucoma at least 1 year after deep sclerectomy were studied in an observational, non-randomised, consecutive case series. Postoperatively 15 eyes (35. 7 %) had goniopuncture with the Nd:YAG laser. Four eyes (9. 5 %) had postoperative subconjunctival injections of mitomycin C and two eyes (4. 7 %) had an injection of 5 -fluorouracil, because of intraocular pressure (IOP) increase. Complete examination and UBM of the filtering site were performed 1 - 6 years after surgery. The following parameters were assessed: (1) Presence of a subconjunctival filtering bleb; (2) presence and volume of an intrascleral cavity; (3) presence of a suprachoroidal hypoechoic area. RESULTS: Intraocular pressure decreased significantly from 28. 1 +/- 2. 5 mmHg preoperatively to 12. 4 +/- 3. 8 (range 7 - 25) mmHg at the time of UBM (at least 1 year after surgery). Forty eyes showed clinically a diffuse filtering bleb. UBM demonstrated a subconjunctival space in all eyes. In 39 eyes (92. 8 %) an intrascleral cavity was observed. The mean volume of this cavity was 1. 8 (range 0. 11 - 6. 53) mm(3). In 19 eyes (45. 2 %) we observed a hypoechoic area in the suprachoroidal space. CONCLUSION: UBM examination demonstrated several aqueous humour drainage pathways. A low-reflective diffuse subconjunctival space meant persistent filtration in all eyes. More than 1 year after surgery 92. 8 % of eyes had a remaining intrascleral cavity. In almost half of the patients an <b>additional</b> suprachoroidal <b>outflow</b> was observed, significantly correlated with a lower IOP...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of a deep search for the {{molecular}} hydrogen shock fronts associated with young stellar outflows in the giant molecular cloud and massive star forming region W 51. A total of 14 outflows were identified by comparing images in the H and K bands and in a narrow-band filter centered on the H 2 1 – 0 S(1) line at 2. 122 µm. A few of the newly discovered outflows were subsequently imaged at higher spatial resolution in the S(1) filter; one outflow was also imaged in the 1. 644 µm emission line of [FeII]. For two of the outflows, high-resolution echelle spectroscopy in the H 2 1 – 0 S(1) line was obtained using NIRSPEC at Keck. For one <b>outflow</b> <b>additional</b> high resolution spectra were obtained in the [FeII] line and in Brγ. The largest and best studied outflow shock front shows a remarkably broad [FeII] line, an unusual high-velocity component in Brγ, and comparably narrow line widths in the H 2 1 – 0 S(1) line. A scenario involving high-velocity shocks and UV excitation of pre-shock material is used to explain these spectra.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relative importance}} of two galactic outflow suppression mechanisms : a) Cosmological infall of the intergalactic gas onto the galaxy, and b) the existence of a hot circumgalactic medium (CGM). Considering only radial motion, the infall reduces the speed of outflowing gas and even halts the outflow, depending on the mass and redshift of the galaxy. For star forming galaxies there exists an upper mass limit beyond which outflows are suppressed by the gravitational field of the galaxy. We find that infall can reduce this upper mass limit approximately by a factor of two (independent of the redshift). Massive galaxies (≳ 10 ^ 12 M_) host large reservoir of hot, diffuse CGM around {{the central part of the}} galaxy. The CGM acts as a barrier between the infalling and outflowing gas and provides an <b>additional</b> source of <b>outflow</b> suppression. We find that at low redshifts (z≲ 3. 5), the CGM is more effective than the infall in suppressing the outflows. Together, these two processes give a mass range in which galaxies are unable to have effective outflows. We also discuss the impact of outflow suppression on the enrichment history of the galaxy and its environment. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} protect pelagic fishery resources, 1 the State Board’s 2010 Delta Flow Report {{identified}} more flow, of a more natural flow pattern, including increased winter/spring Delta inflows and outflow, limitations on reverse Old & Middle River (OMR) flows and exports, and increased fall Delta outflows. New scientific information developed since 2010 largely confirm these recommendations and the Board’s conclusion that “the best available science suggests that current flows are insufficient to protect public trust resources ” (SWRCB 2010 : 2). For longfin smelt and other estuarine species, spring outflow {{continues to be the}} driver of abundance, and, as demonstrated by the high entrainment rates seen in 2012, additional restrictions to reduce and limit entrainment of adult, larval, and juvenile longfin smelt in the winter and spring months are necessary. For Delta smelt, substantial scientific information shows the necessity of limiting entrainment through OMR restrictions and the necessity and benefits of providing increased fall <b>outflows.</b> <b>Additional</b> evidence suggests that Sacramento splittail and other fishes benefit from increased flow rates on inundated floodplains, but that limitations on entrainment are also important (2011 was a record year for entrainment of Sacramento splittail (~ 9, 000, 000 individuals were salvaged at the SWP/CVP facility). And new scientific information since 201...|$|R
40|$|We present new ν = 1 - 0 S(1) H 2, 12 CO J = 2 → 1, and 12 CO J = 3 → 2 {{observations}} of the star-forming clouds OMC- 2 and OMC- 3, one of the densest known groupings of outflows from low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) in the sky. High-velocity 12 CO J = 2 → 1 gas in this region suggests that previously discovered H 2 flows are driving and entraining molecular outflows. However, {{the large number of}} sources and flows within the narrow molecular filament means it is difficult to make a firm association of molecular outflow gas with H 2 flows, except for {{in the case of the}} bipolar east-west H flow. A number of Herbig-Haro (HH) objects, including ones far to the west and east of the main ridge, are identified with H 2 knots. High-resolution spectroscopy in the ν = 1 - 0 S(1) line of 10 H 2 knots shows line profiles consistent with dual forward and reverse shocks. C-shock modeling suggest that asymmetries seen in suspected bow shocks could be evidence of varying magnetic field orientations throughout the cloud. One of the bow shocks in the H flow, YBD- 5, can be successfully modeled by a 100 km s - 1 C-shock propagating into a magnetized, 10 6 cm - 3 medium, although the observations and limitations within the computer code itself do not entirely rule out J-shocks. Mass spectra of the H flow are broken power laws, which might be evidence for a jet that has two entrainment mechanisms for accelerating ambient molecular gas into the outflow. The H 2 luminosity in this flow is many times smaller than the CO mechanical luminosity, but this fact cannot rule out the possibility that a narrow highly collimated jet drives the molecular outflow, owing to uncertainties in extinction, outflow dynamic times, cooling contributions from other lines, and the wind model used. Outflows from OMC- 2 / 3 are likely to contribute to the turbulent pumping of gas within the molecular ridge north of the Orion Nebula. High-velocity gas clumps north of the sources investigated here may represent evidence of <b>additional</b> undiscovered <b>outflows</b> from young stars...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the formation of the multipolar structures of the pre-planetary nebula (PPN) CRL 618, we perform 3 D simulations using a multi-directional bullet model. The optical lobes of CRL 618 and fast molecular outflows at the tips of the lobes have been found to have similar expansion ages of ~ 100 yr. <b>Additional</b> fast molecular <b>outflows</b> were found near the source along the outflow axes with ages of ~ 45 yr, suggesting a second episode of bullet ejections. Thus, in our simulations, two episodes of bullet ejections are assumed. The shaping process is simulated using the ZEUS- 3 D hydrodynamics code that includes molecular and atomic cooling. In addition, molecular chemistry is also included to calculate the CO intensity maps. Our results show the following: (1) Multi-epoch bullets interacting with the toroidal dense core can produce the collimated multiple lobes as seen in CRL 618. The total mass of the bullets is ~ 0. 034 solar mass, consistent with the observed high-velocity CO emission in fast molecular outflows. (2) The simulated CO J= 3 - 2 intensity maps show that the low-velocity cavity wall and the high-velocity outflows along the lobes are reasonably consistent with the observations. The position-velocity diagram of the outflows along the outflow axes shows a linear increase of velocity with distance, similar to the observations. The ejections of these bullets could be due to magneto-rotational explosions or nova-like explosions around a binary companion...|$|R
