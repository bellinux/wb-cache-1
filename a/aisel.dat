30|$|To {{identify}} current {{approaches for}} supporting the selection of DR methods we started with conducting a cross-database literature search with Google Scholar, IEEE Xplorer and <b>AISeL,</b> based on the methodology of (Vom Brocke et al. 2009). Afterwards, existing research projects and research groups are analyzed {{as well as the}} energy informatics field and nearby research contexts. Used search items for conducting the first literature search were: “Demand Side Management”, “Demand Response”, “Evaluation”, “Comparison”, “Benchmark” and “Selection”. Demand-Side-Management is included, because it is often used as synonym to DR (Barbato and Capone 2014), even it is the superordinate concept and thus includes DR. We further included evaluation, comparison and benchmark as search items because we discovered during the iterative search that these items are relevant to the DR method selection process.|$|E

AIS Electronic Library (<b>AISeL)</b> [URL] audienceThe {{increasing}} {{failure of}} IT projects {{has led to}} debate about the way these projects are currently managed and to a search for new concepts and theories about project management in order to decrease the failure rate. We assume {{that it is important}} to know how to observe an on-going IT project in order to better understand the issues at stake. For this reason, without rejecting previous studies, our purpose is to present a method that may improve our understanding of IT project failure. We do this by demonstrating the value of observing the IT project as a project network. We show that IT project success or failure can be understood during the on-going project as lying along a continuum between convergence and divergence. We present the four characteristics that describe the trajectory of convergence or divergence. Our analyse is based on a longitudinal case study, The Pupitre Virtuel project, an IT project in the French educational area national. The dynamic observation of interactions of project network entities along a continuum convergent/divergent stresses the difficulty to isolate one or few failure factors. Conversely, our observation allows understanding the evolution of the project by considering the dynamic of interactions over time and the on-going redefinitions of its entities through controversies. From this perspective, it would be possible to correct the project trajectory in real time in order to avoid its collaps...|$|E

Everydayness links the {{histories}} and crescendos of our lives. Once we lose this "glue", many of our reference points for linking these histories are lost and the structure and patterns of our lives start to unravel. For families separated by prison, telephone calls and letters offer a form of glue, but punitive structures place many constraints on this type of communication. These constraints result in a transformation of technology, often resulting in re-configuration to the point where it plays a different role in the prison context. The analysis presented in this paper points to the need for developing both technologies that support the sharing of everyday experiences and that have functionality to help families re-establish and adjust family relationships and roles. In this analysis we consider how the punitive climate impacts on communication technology design and how to balance this climate with the objective of strengthening family ties. We thank all the participants in both studies. Without their engagement and patience this paper would not have been possible.
