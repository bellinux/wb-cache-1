5|$|It {{is known}} that Point du Sable married a Potawatomi woman named Kitihawa (Christianized to Catherine) on October 27, 1788 in a Catholic {{ceremony}} in Cahokia, an old French missionary town on the Mississippi River, though they were likely married earlier in the 1770s in the Native <b>American</b> <b>tradition.</b> They had a son named Jean and a daughter named Susanne.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Princess {{certainly}} began a long <b>American</b> <b>tradition</b> of romanticizing and sexualizing Pocahontas, who {{was only}} a child in Smith’s original accounts.

5|$|Another <b>American</b> <b>tradition</b> {{is that of}} an apolitical military, {{although}} this custom was of more recent origin, dating back only to the period after the American Civil War. Few officers voted in the 19th century, {{but not so much}} from a lack of interest in politics as because frequently moving from state to state and living on Federal land effectively disenfranchised them under the laws of many states. Under General of the Army William T. Sherman, the Commanding General of the United States Army from 1869 to 1883, who hated politics, this custom of an apolitical military became firmly established.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1899, Warner was {{appointed}} the school's athletic director and his salary more than doubled. A track-and-field program was started that year. Warner knew little about the sport; to prepare as coach he bought every book available and consulted Jack Moakley and Mike Murphy, two of the era's leading head coaches. The program was successful; running was a Native <b>American</b> <b>tradition,</b> and students from the Southwest were known for their stamina in long-distance races.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{agreed with}} Blount's report, which found the populace to {{be opposed to}} annexation. Liliuokalani {{initially}} refused to grant amnesty {{as a condition of}} her reinstatement, saying that she would either execute or banish the current government in Honolulu, but Dole's government refused to yield their position. By December 1893, the matter was still unresolved, and Cleveland referred the issue to Congress. In his message to Congress, Cleveland rejected the idea of annexation and encouraged the Congress to continue the <b>American</b> <b>tradition</b> of non-intervention (see excerpt at right). The Senate, under Democratic control but opposed to Cleveland, commissioned and produced the Morgan Report, which contradicted Blount's findings and found the overthrow was a completely internal affair. Cleveland dropped all talk of reinstating the Queen, and went on to recognize and maintain diplomatic relations with the new Republic of Hawaii.|$|E

25|$|The Constitution {{does not}} {{explicitly}} give judicial review to the Court, and Jefferson {{was very angry}} with Marshall's position, for he wanted the President to decide whether his acts were constitutional or not. Historians mostly agree that {{the framers of the}} Constitution did plan for the Supreme Court {{to have some sort of}} judicial review; Marshall made their goals operational. Judicial review was not new and Marshall himself mentioned it in the Virginia ratifying convention of 1788. Marshall's opinion expressed and fixed in the <b>American</b> <b>tradition</b> and legal system a more basic theory—government under law. That is, judicial review means a government in which no person (not even the President) and no institution (not even Congress or the Supreme Court itself), nor even a majority of voters, may freely work their will in violation of the written Constitution. Marshall himself never declared another law of Congress or act of a president unconstitutional.|$|E
25|$|Ward, a young {{traveling}} salesman of dry goods, {{was concerned}} over {{the plight of}} many rural Midwest Americans who were, he thought, being overcharged and under-served {{by many of the}} small town retailers on whom they had to rely for their general merchandise. He opened his first mail-order house in 1872. By heavy use of the railroads centered on Chicago, and by associating his business with the non-profit Patrons of Husbandry (the Grangers), Ward offered rural customers a far larger stock than generally available in small towns and at a lower price. Unlike local country merchants, Ward offered no bargaining and no credit. His free catalog, printed by the most modern methods, was widely mailed to customers, allowing them to see pictures of consumer goods and imagine how they might be used. Later, Ward used the Post Office's Rural Free Delivery service; he lobbied for a parcel post system that came about in 1906. The early 20th century was the heyday of mail orders and Ward's had become an <b>American</b> <b>tradition,</b> along with its rival Sears Roebuck.|$|E
25|$|Middlebury President Paul Dwight Moody {{began the}} <b>American</b> <b>tradition</b> of a National Christmas Tree in 1923 when the College donated a 48-foot balsam fir for {{use at the}} White House. The tree was {{illuminated}} when Calvin Coolidge, a Vermont native {{in the first year}} of his presidency, flipped an electric switch. The Bread Loaf School of English, Middlebury's graduate school of English, was established at the College's Bread Loaf Mountain campus in 1920. The Bread Loaf Writers' Conference was established in 1926. In 1978, the Bread Loaf School of English expanded to include a campus at Lincoln College, Oxford University. In 1991, the School expanded to include a campus at St. John's College in New Mexico, and to the University of North Carolina, Asheville, in 2006. The C.V. Starr-Middlebury Schools Abroad began in 1949 with the school in Paris; they now host students at 38 sites in Argentina, Brazil, China, Cameroon, Chile, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Italy, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Mexico, Russia, Spain, and Uruguay. The Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies was founded as an educational charity in 1975 by Drs John and Sandy Feneley in Oxford, England, establishing a facility at St. Michael's Hall in 1978, including the Feneley Library, and close links with Keble College, Oxford; in 2014, CMRS became part of Middlebury College Schools Abroad as Middlebury-CMRS, offering U.S. undergraduates an Oxford Humanities Research Program and Middlebury Museum Studies in Oxford. In 1965, Middlebury established its Environmental Studies program, creating the first undergraduate Environmental Studies program in the U.S. Nationally affiliated fraternities were abolished in 1990; some chose to become co-educational social houses which continue today.|$|E
