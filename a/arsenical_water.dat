40|$|In {{a limited}} {{area on the}} {{southwest}} coast of Taiwan, where artesian well water with {{a high concentration of}} arsenic has been used for more than 60 years, a high prevalence of chronic arsenicism has been observed in recent years. The total population of this "endemic " area is approximately 100, 000. A general survey of 40, 421 inhabitants and follow-up of 1, 108 patients with blackfoot disease were made. Blackfoot disease, so-termed locally, is a peripheral vascular disorder resulting in gangrene of the extremities, especially the feet. The overall prevalence rates for skin cancer was 10. 6 per 1000, and for blackfoot disease 8. 9 per 1000. Generally speaking, the prevalence increased steadily with age in both diseases. The prevalence rates for skin cancer and blackfoot disease increased with the arsenic content of well water, i. e., the higher the arsenic content, the more patients with skin cancer and blackfoot disease. A dose-response relationship between blackfoot disease and the duration of water intake was also noted. Furthermore, the degree of permanent impairment of function in the patient was directly related to duration of intake of <b>arsenical</b> <b>water</b> and to duration of such intake at the time of onset. The most common cause of death in the patients with skin cancer and blackfoot disease was carcinoma of various sites. The 5 -year survival rate after the onset of blackfoot disease was 76. 3 %; the 10 -year survival rate was 63. 3 % and 15 -year survival rate, 52. 2 %. The 50 % survival point was 16 years after onset of the disease...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the role of}} the mineral-adapted acidiphilic microorganism. Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans in the beneficiation of arsenopyrite-containing multisulfides (pyrite and chalcopyrite) and the bioremediation of the resulting <b>arsenical</b> waste <b>water.</b> It was found that adaptation to minerals alters the surface properties of the microorganism. Bacterial adaptation to arsenopyrite and controlled bacterial adhesion to mineral surfaces lead to selectivity in arsenopyrite separation. Bioremoval of arsenic ions (both arsenite and arsenate ions) by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Of late, a consirable {{interest}} {{has grown in}} literature on early development of arsenicosis and untimely death in humans after exposure to iAs in drinking water in utero or during the childhood. The mechanism {{of this kind of}} intrauterine arsenic poisoning is not known; how-ever it is often suggested to involve stem cells. We looked into this possibility by investigat-ing in mice the influence of chronic in utero exposure to <b>arsenical</b> drinking <b>water</b> preliminarily on multipotent adult stem cell and progenitor cell counts at the beginning of neonatal age. We found that repeated intake of 42. 5 or 85 ppm iAs in drinking water by preg-nant BALB/c mice substantially changed the counts of EpASCs, the progenitor cells, and the differentiated cells in epidermis of their zero day old neonates. EpASCs counts decreased considerably and the differentiated / apoptosed cell counts increased exten-sively whereas the counts of progenitor cell displayed a biphasic effect. The observed trend of response was dose-dependent and statistically significant. These observations signified a disruption in stem cell homeostasis. The disorder was in parallel with changes in expres-sion of biomarkers of stem cell and progenitor (TA) cell besides changes in expression o...|$|R

EpASCs counts decreased considerably and the differentiated/apoptosed cell counts increased extensively whereas the counts of progenitor cell displayed a biphasic effect. The observed trend of response was dose-dependent and statistically significant. These observations signified a disruption in stem cell homeostasis. The disorder was in parallel with changes in expression of biomarkers of stem cell and progenitor (TA) cell besides changes in expression of pro-inflammatory and antioxidant molecules namely Nrf 2, NFkB, TNF-Î±, and GSH. The biological monitoring of exposure to iAs and the ensuing transplacental toxicity was verifiable correspondingly by the increase in iAs burden in hair, kidney, skin, liver of nulliparous female mice and the onset of chromosomal aberrations in neonate bone marrow cells. The combined intake of selenite and curcumin in utero was found to prevent the disruption of homeostasis and associated biochemical changes to a great extent. The mechanism of prevention seemed possibly to involve (a) curcumin and Keap- 1 interaction, (b) consequent escalated de novo GSH biosynthesis, and (c) the resultant toxicant disposition. These observations are important with respect to the development of vulnerability to arsenicosis and other morbidities later in life after repeated in utero or postnatal exposure to iAs in drinking water that may occur speculatively through impairment of adult stem cell dependent innate tissue repair mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) {{have been}} used to refine the {{solid-state}} speciation of As in mine waste materials and stream-bed sediments from the Baccu Locci mine area in Sardinia, Italy. The combined use of TEM and XPS confirmed previous studies and pointed out that: (i) As is contained in plumbojarosite in substitution of S, (ii) As-bearing Fe(III) hydroxides are represented by arsenical 2 -line ferrihydrites with most Fe/As molar ratios in the range of 1. 6 - 3. 2, (iii) scorodite often lacks long range order. Arsenatian plumbojarosite will tend to dissolve incongruently in ferrihydrite, releasing Pb and As into water. However, Pb is fated to precipitate as Pb(OH) (2) or to be adsorbed onto ferrihydrite, whereas As mobility is favoured since the adsorptive capacity of ferrihydrite for As(V) is notably reduced under the neutral to alkaline pH conditions occurring in the Baccu Locci stream <b>water.</b> <b>Arsenical</b> ferrihydrites will tend to be converted into goethite or hematite with time, releasing As into the water {{as a consequence of the}} notably lower density of the adsorption sites of the crystalline Fe(III) phases. Also scorodite is relatively unstable under the Baccu Locci system conditions, and its stability is further decreased owing to the higher solubility of the amorphous form compared to the crystalline one...|$|R
