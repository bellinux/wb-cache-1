25|$|Despite a move of yards, Yarrows outgrew its London {{site and}} this {{and the cost of}} land and labour in London led to a second move to what was at that time a {{greenfield}} site at Scotstoun in the west of Glasgow, beginning in 1906. Between 4,000 and 5,000 tons of material had to be transported, from models to heavy machine tools. A train-load of from forty to fifty wagons left the works at Poplar every day. The first vessel launched from the new works at Scotstoun on 14 July 1908 was the lead ship of the Pará-class destroyers for the Brazilian Navy. The company also established the Coventry Ordnance Works joint venture in 1905, building a large factory near to its Scotstoun Shipyard in 1910. During the First World War, the company developed the pioneering Erskine <b>artificial</b> <b>limb</b> with Sir William Macewen.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the last}} cannon shots fired that day hit Paget in the right leg, necessitating its {{amputation}}. According to anecdote, {{he was close to}} Wellington when his leg was hit, and exclaimed, [...] "By God, sir, I've lost my leg!" [...] — to which Wellington replied, [...] "By God, sir, so you have!" [...] According to his aide-de-camp, Thomas Wildman, during the amputation Paget smiled and said, [...] "I have had a pretty long run. I have been a beau these 47 years and it would not be fair to cut the young men out any longer." [...] While Paget had an articulated <b>artificial</b> <b>limb</b> fitted, his amputated leg meanwhile had a somewhat macabre after-life as a tourist attraction in the village of Waterloo in Belgium, to which it had been removed and where it was later interred.|$|E

After 34 operations, {{it had to be}} amputated and replaced with an <b>artificial</b> <b>limb.</b> [...] His friend Noël Coward visited him in the hospital and wrote in his diary, [...] "The lines of ceaseless pain have been wiped from his face.... I am convinced that his whole life will cheer up and that his work will profit accordingly." [...] In fact, Porter never wrote another song after the amputation and spent the remaining six years of his life in relative seclusion, seeing only intimate friends. He continued to live in the Waldorf Towers in New York in his memorabilia-filled apartment. On weekends he often visited an estate in the Berkshires, and he stayed in California during the summers.|$|E

6000|$|At {{all times}} he thought {{originally}} in words of delightful originality, which painted a fact {{with the greatest}} vividness. Of {{a person who had}} a nervous twitching of the face, and who wished to call up a friend to them, he said, [...] "He spasmed to the fellow across the room, and introduced him." [...] His written style had traits of the same bold adventurousness, but it was his speech which was most captivating. As I write of him I see him before me: his white bearded face, with a kindly intensity which at first glance seemed fierce, the mouth humorously shaping the mustache, the eyes vague behind the glasses; his sensitive hand gripping the stick on which he rested his weight to ease it from the <b>artificial</b> <b>limb</b> he wore.|$|E
6000|$|Nobody cared {{less than}} Schopenhauer for the wisdom that {{is drawn from}} books, or has said such hard things of mere reading. In the short piece to which I have already {{referred}} (p. 80), he works out {{the difference between the}} Scholar who has read in books, and the Thinkers, the Geniuses, the Lights of the World, and Furtherers of the human race, who have read directly from the world's own pages. Reading, he says, is only a succedaneum for one's own thinking. Reading is thinking with a strange head instead of one's own. People who get their wisdom out of books are like those who have got their knowledge of a country from the descriptions of travellers. Truth that has been picked up from books only sticks to us like an <b>artificial</b> <b>limb,</b> or a false tooth, or a rhinoplastic nose; the truth we have acquired by our own thinking is like the natural member.

60|$|It is a {{critical}} moment in life when middle age awakens {{a man from the}} illusions that have been crowning the earlier years with inward glory. Some are contemptuously willing to let the vision and the dream pass into easy oblivion, while they hasten {{to make up for lost}} time in close pursuit of the main chance. Others can forgive anything sooner than their own exploded ideal, and the ghost of their dead enthusiasm haunts them with an embittering presence. Pattison drops a good many expressions about his Anglo-Catholic days that betray something like vindictiveness--which is certainly not philosophical, whatever else it was. But his intellectual faculties were too strong to let him feed on the poison of a reactionary antipathy to a deserted faith. Puseyism, as he says, dropped away from him for lack of nutrition of the religious brain,--which perhaps at the best was more like an <b>artificial</b> <b>limb</b> than a natural organ in a man of Pattison's constitution. For some five years he was inspired by a new and more genuine enthusiasm--for forming and influencing the minds of the young. He found that he was the possessor of what, for lack of a better name, he calls a magnetic power in dealing with the students, and his moral ascendency enabled him to make Lincoln the best managed college in Oxford.|$|E

50|$|Artificial {{arms and}} legs, or prosthetics, are {{intended}} to restore a degree of normal function to amputees. Mechanical devices that allow amputees to walk again or continue to use two hands have probably been in use since ancient times, the most notable one being the simple peg leg. Since then, the development of <b>artificial</b> <b>limbs</b> has progressed rapidly. New plastics and other materials, such as carbon fiber have allowed <b>artificial</b> <b>limbs</b> to become stronger and lighter, limiting the amount of extra energy necessary to operate the limb. Additional materials have allowed <b>artificial</b> <b>limbs</b> to look much more realistic. Prostheses can roughly be categorized as upper- and lower-extremity and can take many shapes and sizes.|$|R
