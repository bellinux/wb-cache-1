5|$|Critics {{also pointed}} out that the index could allow the city to reach lethally high levels of carbon {{monoxide}} without any alert if the levels of other pollutants remained low. However, the department had to contend with the fact that no universally accepted standards for recording smog existed <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> many of the flaws existed {{for lack of a better}} alternative.

5|$|Despite his partial {{recovery}} evident in America, Weber {{felt that he}} was unable to resume regular teaching <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> continued on as a private scholar, helped by an inheritance in 1907. In 1909, disappointed with the Verein, he co-founded the German Sociological Association (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie, or DGS) and served as its first treasurer. He would, however, resign from the DGS in 1912. In 1912, Weber tried to organise a left-wing political party to combine social-democrats and liberals. This attempt was unsuccessful, in part because many liberals feared social-democratic revolutionary ideals.|$|E

5|$|Weber also ran, unsuccessfully, for a {{parliamentary}} seat, {{as a member}} of the liberal German Democratic Party, which he had co-founded.

Weber commanded widespread respect but relatively little influence. Weber's role in German politics remains controversial to this day.|$|E
5|$|A 24-million-year-old fossil {{belonging}} to Triturus, perhaps a marbled newt, {{shows that the}} genus already existed <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> contradicts the earlier estimate of 8.3 million years ago (mya) for the split between the crested and marbled newts and their sister genus, the European brook newts (Calotriton). An age calibration study based on this and other fossils places that divergence much earlier, at around 39 mya in the Eocene, with an uncertainty range of 47 to 34 mya. Based on this estimation, authors have investigated diversification within the genus and related it to paleogeography: The crested and marbled newts split between 30 and 24 mya, and the two species of marbled newts have been separated for 4.7–6.8 million years.|$|E
