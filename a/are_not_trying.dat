500|$|According to science-fiction {{historian}} Donald H. Tuck, Beyond published [...] "some {{very good}} material," [...] with appearances by many well-known authors, and {{the magazine is}} often cited as being the successor to the unusual fantasy tradition of Unknown. Author James Gunn said of the new fantasy magazines {{that appeared in the}} 1950s that [...] "the best of these was Beyond, created by Horace Gold as a companion fantasy magazine to Galaxy, which he had created three years before. Beyond Fantasy Fiction aimed at the same rationalized fantasy niche that Unknown had established and to which Gold had contributed stories." [...] Not everyone thought the magazine was completely successful in emulating Unknown, however; P.Schuyler Miller, reviewing an anthology drawn from the pages of Beyond, was generally approving but commented that [...] "Except for Budrys, Pohl, Brown and Sturgeon, these stories from Beyond are rather self-conscious. They are best when they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> to be like Unknown." [...] Miller's assessment of the magazine overall was that it [...] "made a pass at the same position [...] but didn't make it." ...|$|E

If there's anything I can do to champion the cause and further it, I will, shy of getting arrested." [...] Swedish athletes Emma Green Tregaro and Moa Hjelmer painted her fingernails in rainbow colors as a symbolic protest. However, Tregaro was forced to re-paint them after they were deemed a political gesture that violated {{the rules of the}} IAAF. In response, she re-painted them red as a symbol of love. Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbaeva criticized Tregaro's gesture as being disrespectful to the host country, stating in a press conference that [...] "we have our law which everyone has to respect. When we go to different countries, we try to follow their rules. We <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> to set our rules over there. We are just trying to be respectful." [...] After Isinbaeva's remarks were characterized as being homophobic, she argued that her choice of words had been misinterpreted by the media, and that she was against the discrimination of gays.|$|E

500|$|A new league, the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA), {{was formed}} in late November 1909. One of the teams, the All-Montreal Hockey Club, hired Ross as a playing-manager, but the league only lasted to mid-January 1910 before disbanding. Ross, who scored four goals in four games in the CHA, then signed with the Haileybury Comets of the National Hockey Association (NHA), a league formed in December 1909, which {{proved to be the}} {{stronger}} replacement to the ECAHA as the highest level of hockey in Canada. He received $2,700 to play in the 1910 season, which lasted from January to March, playing twelve games for the team and finishing with six goals. Before the following season, the NHA imposed a salary cap of $5,000 per team. The players, including Ross, were unhappy as this would result in a pay decrease, and began looking to form their own league without a cap. Ross wrote to the Montreal Herald, stating [...] "all the players want is a fair deal ... The players <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> to bulldoze the NHA, but we want to know where we get off at." [...] The plans were abandoned when they realized all the suitable arenas would be unavailable as they were owned or leased by the NHA. Ross scored four goals in eleven games with the Wanderers, who finished fourth in the five team league. During a match against the Quebec Bulldogs on February 25, 1911, Ross knocked out Eddie Oatman in a fight, provoking a massive brawl between the two teams, which the police had to break up. The fight helped to increase the reputation Ross had as a tough player unwilling to back down from any opponent. The following season Ross had eleven goals in nineteen games as the Wanderers improved to second in the league.|$|E

2500|$|Jeta Amata, {{who grew}} up in the Niger Delta stated in an {{interview}} that it has been a while since he has wanted to make a film on the Niger Delta. He had written three scripts on it for about eight years; but as the issues kept escalating, it seemed more difficult to make [...] "but I got to the point where I knew it just has to be now". [...] Black November is fiction based on an actual event, the title being derived from the month in which activist Ken Saro-Wiwa was executed in 1995. Amata had once met Saro-Wiwa through his father and was affected by his death. The recent Niger Delta militancy further triggered Amata's interest to make the film; Jeta Amata had to meet with most of the Niger Delta ex-militants such as Asari Dokubo and Boyloaf to listen to their sides of the story. He stated in an interview: [...] "What I'm doing is what they did, but without weapons." [...] Amata explained that even though the film touched some political points, he is more concerned about the human parts of the story, about the feelings of the people and what they passed through: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> to fight the government, trying to fight the oil companies, no -- we are trying to repair what has been damaged". [...] The film was majorly funded by a Nigerian business magnate, Captain Hosa Wells Okunbo, who says he does not want to go down in history as [...] "just another rich merchant", he wants to give something back to the region that made him wealthy.|$|E

It is exceedingly to be regretted that with the best intentions and kindest purposes, want of caution and experience on her part should have enabled the prisoner thus to secure himself from the possibility of a conviction; but {{there can be no doubt}} that the evidence before us is such as to leave no alternative but a verdict of not guilty." ...|$|E

So that the ball is once set rolling, it may be trusted to keep in motion, and {{there can be little doubt}} that such expressions of feeling, among the mercantile community of the capital, will have some effect even upon nobles who pretend to despise trade, but who are not unfrequently in debt to traders, and who hold their views in a certain respect." ...|$|E
6000|$|History is much decried; it is {{a tissue}} of errors, we are told, no doubt correctly; and rival {{historian}}s expose each other's blunders with gratification. Yet the worst historian has a clearer {{view of the}} period he studies than the best of us can hope to form of that in which we live. The obscurest epoch is to-day; and that for a thousand reasons of inchoate tendency, conflicting report, and sheer mass and multiplicity of experience; but chiefly, perhaps, by reason of an insidious shifting of landmarks. Parties and ideas continually move, but not by measurable marches on a stable course; the political soil itself steals forth by imperceptible degrees, like a travelling glacier, carrying on its bosom not only political parties but their flag-posts and cantonments; so that {{what appears to be}} an eternal city founded on hills is but a flying island of Laputa. It is for this reason in particular that we are all becoming Socialists without knowing it; by which I would not in the least refer to the acute case of Mr. Hyndman and his horn-blowing supporters, sounding their trumps of a Sunday within the walls of our individualist Jericho--but to the stealthy change that has come over the spirit of Englishmen and English legislation. A little while ago, and we were still for liberty; [...] "crowd a few more thousands on the bench of Government," [...] we seemed to cry; [...] "keep her head direct on liberty, and we cannot help but come to port." [...] This is over; laisser faire declines in favour; our legislation grows authoritative, grows philanthropical, bristles with new duties and new penalties, and casts a spawn of inspectors, who now begin, note-book in hand, to darken the face of England. It may be right or wrong, we <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> that; but one thing it is beyond doubt: it is Socialism in action, and the strange thing is that we scarcely know it.|$|E
60|$|Of {{course this}} {{generalisation}} about America, like other historical things, {{is subject to}} all sorts of cross divisions and exceptions, to be considered in their place. The negroes are a special problem, because of what white men in the past did to them. The Japanese are a special problem, because of what men fear that they in the future may do to white men. The Jews are a special problem, because of what they and the Gentiles, in the past, present, and future, seem to have the habit of doing to each other. But the point is not that nothing exists in America except this idea; it is that nothing like this idea exists anywhere except in America. This idea is not internationalism; on the contrary it is decidedly nationalism. The Americans are very patriotic, and wish to make their new citizens patriotic Americans. But it is the idea of making a new nation literally out of any old nation that comes along. In a word, what is unique is not America but what is called Americanisation. We understand nothing till we understand the amazing ambition to Americanise the Kamskatkan and the Hairy Ainu. We <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> to Anglicise thousands of French cooks or Italian organ-grinders. France is not trying to Gallicise thousands of English trippers or German prisoners of war. America is the one place in the world where this process, healthy or unhealthy, possible or impossible, is going on. And the process, as I have pointed out, is not internationalisation. It would be truer to say it is the nationalisation of the internationalised. It is making a home out of vagabonds and a nation out of exiles. This is what at once illuminates and softens the moral regulations which we may really think faddist or fanatical. They are abnormal; but in one sense this experiment of a home for the homeless is abnormal. In short, it has long been recognised that America was an asylum. It is only since Prohibition that it has looked a little like a lunatic asylum.|$|E
