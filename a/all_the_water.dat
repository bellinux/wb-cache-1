5|$|It {{was also}} {{predicted}} that the standing water caused by the storm surge would render {{most of the city}} uninhabitable for weeks and that the destruction of oil and petrochemical refineries in the surrounding area would spill waste into the flooding. The resulting mess would coat every surface, converting the city into a toxic marsh until water could be drained. Some experts said that it could take six months or longer to pump <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> out of the city.|$|E
5|$|Quolls {{are mostly}} carnivorous. The smaller quolls {{primarily}} eat insects, birds, frogs, lizards and fruit; the larger species eat birds, reptiles, and mammals, including echidnas and possums. The tiger quoll's diet {{is dominated by}} mammals such as brushtail possums, rabbits and hares. The exact mix is variable depending {{on the availability of}} prey after bushfires, and can include carrion or bandicoots when food is scarce. The other species of quoll have also been known to eat carrion. The paws and vibrissae of quolls allow them to reach into small burrows to find prey. Quolls hunt by stalking. Depending on the size of its prey, a quoll may leap or pounce on it. Quolls pin small prey down with their front paws while devouring it, and jump onto larger prey, sinking in their claws and closing their jaws around the neck. Quolls can obtain <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> they need from their food, making them quite adaptable during droughts or other periods of water shortage.|$|E
5|$|Establishment of the C made Everglades National Park {{completely}} {{dependent upon}} another political entity for its survival. One of the C's projects was Levee 29, laid along the Tamiami Trail {{on the northern}} border of the park. Levee 29 featured four flood control gates that controlled <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> entering Everglades National Park; before construction, water flowed in through open drain pipes. The period from 1962 to 1965 was one of drought for the Everglades, and Levee 29 remained closed to allow the Biscayne Aquifer—the fresh water source for South Florida—to stay filled. Animals began to cross Tamiami Trail for the water held in WCA 3, and many were killed by cars. Biologists estimate the population of alligators in Everglades National Park was halved; otters nearly became extinct. The populations of wading birds had been reduced by 90percent from the 1940s. When park management and the U.S. Department of the Interior asked the C for assistance, the C offered to build a levee along the southern border of Everglades National Park to retain waters that historically flowed through the mangroves and into Florida Bay. Though the C refused to send the park more water, they constructed Canal 67, bordering {{the east side of}} the park and carrying excess water from Lake Okeechobee to the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|The {{quality of}} Malvern water is {{attributable}} to its source. Malvern Hills are amongst the oldest and hardest rocks found in the United Kingdom, with their geology responsible {{for the quality of}} Malvern's spring water. The hills consist of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rock, the oldest of which are about 670 million years old. The rocks are characterised by low porosity and high secondary permeability via fissures. Malvern water is rainwater and snow meltwater that percolates through fissures created by the pressures of tectonic movements about 300 million years ago when advancing sedimentary layers of Silurian shale and limestone were pushed into and under older Precambrian rock. When the fissures are saturated, a water table forms and the water emerges as springs around the fault lines between the strata. Depending on rainfall, the flow can vary from as little as 36 litres (8 gallons) per minute to over 350 litres (77 gallons) per minute. The water permeates through the rock which, because of its hardness, leaves little or no mineral traces in the water, {{while at the same time}} the very fine cracks act as a filter for other impurities. Rainfall on the Malvern Hills is thought to be sufficient to account for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> that runs out of the springs, reflected for example in some spring flows six to eight weeks after heavy rainfall, and in reduced flows after a dry period.|$|E

25|$|A notch weir is any weir {{where the}} {{physical}} barrier is {{significantly higher than}} the water level except for a specific notch (often V-shaped) cut into the panel.
