Sheffer, written [...] "|" [...] (see vertical bar, {{not to be}} confused with [...] "||" [...] which is often used to represent disjunction), [...] "Dpq", or [...] "↑" [...] (an upwards arrow), denotes a logical operation that is equivalent to the negation of the conjunction operation, expressed in ordinary language as [...] "not both". It is also called nand ("not and") or the <b>alternative</b> <b>denial,</b> since it says in effect that at least one of its operands is false. In Boolean algebra and digital electronics it is known as the NAND operation.|$|R
5000|$|Habitual repressors {{have been}} shown to have fewer unhappy {{memories}} than other people, but the difference rests in the secondary associations. [...] Research of repressors concluded that they had equally strong negative reactions to bad memories, however those memories did not evoke other negative feelings as much as they did for non-repressors. [...] The phrase, [...] "architecture of less complex emotions" [...] was created to describe this phenomenon. [...] Repressors have bad memories just like anyone else, but are less troubled by them because they are relatively isolated in memory. [...] The most current researchers have agreed that isolation {{is one of the more}} effective and important mechanisms of defense from harmful cognitions. [...] It is a coping mechanism that does not require delusions of reality, which makes it more plausible than some <b>alternatives</b> (<b>denial,</b> sublimation, projection, etc.). Further research will be needed for accounts of isolation to be considered fully concrete.|$|R

Security is about trade-offs and adhering to realistic security needs, employed to support core business processes. Also, modern systems are subject to a highly competitive market, often demanding rapid development cycles, short life-time, short time-to-market, and small budgets. Security evaluation standards, such as ISO 14508 Common Criteria and ISO/IEC 27002, are not adequate for evaluating the security of many modern systems for resource limitations, time-tomarket, and other constraints. Towards this end, we propose an alternative time and cost effective approach for evaluating the security level of a security solution, system or part thereof. Our approach relies on collecting information from different sources, who are trusted to varying degrees, and on using a trust measure to aggregate available information when deriving security level. Our approach is quantitative and implemented as a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) topology, allowing us to reason over uncertain information and seemingly aggregating disparate information. We illustrate our approach by deriving the security level of two <b>alternative</b> <b>Denial</b> of Service (DoS) solutions. Our approach {{can also be used}} in the context of security solution trade-off analysis. Key Words: security evaluation, trust, bayesian belief networks, common criteria...|$|R

However, if the EPU were not approved for PTN Units 3 and 4, other agencies and electric power organizations may be required to pursue other means, such as fossil fuel or alternative fuel power generation, to provide electric generation capacity to offset future demand. Construction and operation of such a fossil-fueled or alternative-fueled plant could result in impacts in air quality, land use, and waste management greater than those identified for the proposed EPU for PTN Units 3 and 4. Furthermore, the proposed EPU does not involve environmental impacts that are significantly different from those originally identified in the PTN Unit...|$|R

40|$|Reasoning with conditionals {{involving}} causal {{content is}} known to be affected by retrieval of counterexamples from semantic memory. In this study we examined the characteristics of this search process in everyday conditional reasoning. In Experiment 1 we manipulated the number (zero to four) of explicitly presented counterexamples (alternative causes or disabling conditions) for causal conditionals. In Experiment 2, using a generation pretest, we measured the number of counterexamples participants could retrieve for a set of causal conditionals. One month after the pretest, participants were presented a reasoning task with the same conditionals. The experiments indicated that acceptance of modus ponens linearly decreased with every additionally retrieved disabler, whereas affirmation of the consequent acceptance linearly decreased {{as a function of the}} number of retrieved <b>alternatives.</b> Results for <b>denial</b> of the antecedent and modus tollens were less clear. The findings show that the search process does not necessarily stop after retrieval of a single counterexample and that every additional counterexample has an impact on the inference acceptance. status: publishe...|$|R
