40|$|The {{formation}} of a localized differential <b>aeration</b> <b>cell</b> on metals, susceptible to both anodic and cathodic corrosion, is a serious threat because of multiple degradation processes commencing with the passivation layer destruction. By using local electrochemical and X-ray dispersive techniques, it has been demonstrated that the differential <b>aeration</b> <b>cell</b> formed on high brass (-brass, Cu 65 -Zn 35) {{in the presence of}} 1 H-benzotriazole or 5 -methyl- 1 H-benzotriazole plays both corrosion-inhibiting and accelerating roles, depending on the inhibitor exposure time. Alternating-current scanning electrochemical microscopy was used to image local electrochemical activity, whereas energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy provided evidence for the mechanism of the observed phenomena. Short-term exposure to the inhibitor (5 min) promotes the {{formation of}} a passivation layer in the waterline region. In contrast, after prolonged exposure (45 min), a deficient passivation layer develops for both inhibitors. An excess of zinc(II) -inhibitor complexes in the passivation layer is accountable for the corrosion resistance of the region with high differential aeration. Rapid dezincification and local alkalinization facilitate the initial rapid {{formation of a}} passivation layer in the area under differential aeration to preserve its composition upon further modification...|$|E

Serological proteome analysis (SERPA) is a promising technique that can be used to identify S. aureus immuno-dominant determinants providing that bacterial culture conditions used to grow S. aureus strains for protein sample preparation mimic the context of mastitis. A S. aureus strain was used in experimental mastitis to generate sheep serum used to determine the best growth conditions for SERPA.

Corrosion of steel {{structures in the}} Duluth-Superior Harbor (DSH) is a severe economic problem. This corrosion is characterized by deep pits covered by crusty, orange, blister-like structures called tubercles. Prior research demonstrated these tubercles contain both iron-oxidizing (IOB) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) but fine scale changes of bacterial community structure within these tubercles remain unknown. Experimental steel coupons were placed at four sites in the DSH in 2006 and 2012 and recovered in 2013 to measure chemical gradients and identify bacteria associated with young and old corrosion tubercles. Oxygen concentrations measured with microelectrodes decreased from saturation in the overlying water to nearly anoxic conditions at the surface of tubercles while ferrous iron (Fe 2 +) concentration increased with depth inside the tubercles. Bacterial DNA from {{different regions of the}} tubercles was sequenced using a next-generation sequencing technique to characterize the bacterial communities. Bacterial community composition changed within the tubercles. Families containing bacteria that oxidize iron and sulfur were consistently found on the outsides of tubercles and on non-tubercle steel. Families with bacteria that reduce iron and sulfur were found on the undersides of tubercles and in corrosion pits on the steel surface. Iron-oxidizing bacteria were more abundant after 0. 8 years than 6. 6 years and were distributed throughout tubercles while sulfate-reducing bacteria were most abundant in corrosion pits. Combined, these data are consistent with the cathodic depolarization (differential <b>aeration</b> <b>cell</b> model) and direct electron transfer theories of pitting corrosion, which provide explanations for the roles of bacteria in the accelerated corrosion of steel structures...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{complexities}} involved in both microbiologically influenced corrosion and deterioration of reinforced concrete structures by algae are explained. In this regards, the five possible corrosion/deterioration mechanisms {{that may be}} expected are addressed and described. These mechanisms are as follows: Absorption of some chemicals necessary for the algae from within the cement paste of the concrete: this mechanism can finally result in drying out the concrete and developing cracks {{as a result of}} formation of internal cavities and voids. Biofilm formation and increasing the likelihood of attracting more micro-/macroorganisms that can either deteriorate the concrete itself or the reinforcement steel inside, or both. An example as such can be development of an environment favorable for the acid-producing sulphur oxidizing bacteria that through generating very acidic conditions are capable of doing harm to both metallic and non-metallic phases of the reinforced concrete. Development of electrochemical cells such as differential <b>aeration</b> <b>cells</b> due to the photosynthetic driven oxygen production and consumption features of algae.

40|$|A {{chemotaxis}} {{signal transduction}} pathway (hereafter called Che 1) {{has been previously}} identified in the alphaproteobacterium Azospirillum brasilense. Previous experiments have demonstrated that although mutants lacking CheB and/or CheR homologs from this pathway are defective in chemotaxis, a mutant in which the entire chemotaxis pathway has been mutated displayed a chemotaxis phenotype mostly {{similar to that of}} the parent strain, suggesting that the primary function of this Che 1 pathway is not the control of motility behavior. Here, we report that mutants carrying defined mutations in the cheA 1 (strain AB 101) and the cheY 1 (strain AB 102) genes and a newly constructed mutant lacking the entire operon [Δ(cheA 1 -cheR 1) ::Cm] (strain AB 103) were defective, but not null, for chemotaxis and aerotaxis and had a minor defect in swimming pattern. We found that mutations in genes of the Che 1 pathway affected the cell length of actively growing cells but not their growth rate. Cells of a mutant lacking functional cheB 1 and cheR 1 genes (strain BS 104) were significantly longer than wild-type cells, whereas cells of mutants impaired in the cheA 1 or cheY 1 genes, as well as a mutant lacking a functional Che 1 pathway, were significantly shorter than wild-type cells. Both the modest chemotaxis defects and the observed differences in cell length could be complemented by expressing the wild-type genes from a plasmid. In addition, under conditions of high <b>aeration,</b> <b>cells</b> of mutants lacking functional cheA 1 or cheY 1 genes or the Che 1 operon formed clumps due to cell-to-cell aggregation, whereas the mutant lacking functional CheB 1 and CheR 1 (BS 104) clumped poorly, if at all. Further analysis suggested that the nature of the exopolysaccharide produced, rather than the amount, may be involved in this behavior. Interestingly, mutants that displayed clumping behavior (lacking cheA 1 or cheY 1 genes or the Che 1 operon) also flocculated earlier and quantitatively more than the wild-type cells, whereas the mutant lacking both CheB 1 and CheR 1 was delayed in flocculation. We propose that the Che 1 chemotaxis-like pathway modulates the cell length as well as clumping behavior, suggesting a link between these two processes. Our data are consistent with a model in which the function of the Che 1 pathway in regulating these cellular functions directly affects flocculation, a cellular differentiation process initiated under conditions of nutritional imbalance...|$|R

40|$|A metabolically {{engineered}} Escherichia coli strain SBS 550 MG (pHL 413) {{was used}} in this study to investigate the impact of various culture operating conditions for improving the specific succinate production rate for better final titer while maintaining the theoretical succinate yield on glucose in multiphase fed-batch cultures. Previously, we reported that changes in the level of <b>aeration</b> during the <b>cell</b> growth phase significantly modified gene expression profiles and metabolic fluxes in this system (Martinez et al. 2010). Based on these observations, the examination of culture conditions was mainly focused on the aerobic growth phase. It was found that 2 - 5 h of low dissolved oxygen culture during the aerobic phase improves cell productivity, but pH control during the aerobic phase was not favorable for the system. Cell viability has been identified as a major limiting factor for succinate production. Supplementing LB medium and betaine, an anti-osmotic stress reagent, did not improve cell activity. A higher succinate titer (537. 8 mM) using the current metabolic engineering E. coli strain was achieved, which can potentially be improved further by increasing cell viability. </p...|$|R
40|$|Technology of {{microbial}} {{fuel cells}} {{allowing for the}} direct production of electricity from biodegradable materials can provide only energy production, but also wastewater treatment. This technology is seen as supporting of the traditional wastewater treatment. One {{of the problems with}} microbial fuel cells is a low current density of those energy sources. Nonetheless, it is possible to increase the current density by using the catalyst for electrodes (anode and cathode). The possibility of wastewater treatment using the Ni-Co alloy as catalyst for single chamber microbial fuel cells is presented in this paper. The studies have included measurements of H 2 O 2 reduction on Ni-Co catalyst, power of cell and current density and also COD reduction. The reduction time for COD with the use of single chamber microbial fuel cell with Ni-Co cathode is similar to the reduction time with <b>aeration.</b> In analysed <b>cell</b> was obtained cell power of 13 mW, and current density of 0. 21 mA/cm 2. The possibility of using the Ni-Co alloy as catalyst for cathode of single chamber microbial fuel cells is presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Cytochrome P 450 enzymes (P 450 s) are {{exceptionally}} versatile monooxygenases, mediating hydroxylations of unactivated C H bonds, epoxidations, dealkylations, and N- and S-oxidations as well {{as other}} less common reactions. In the conventional view of the catalytic cycle, based upon studies of P 450 s in vitro, substrate binding to the Fe(III) resting state facilitates the first 1 -electron reduction of the heme. However, the resting state of P 450 s in vivo has not been examined. In the present study, whole cell difference spectroscopy of bacterial (CYP 101 A 1 and CYP 176 A 1, i. e. P 450 cam and P 450 cin) and mammalian (CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 C 9, CYP 2 A 6, CYP 2 C 19, and CYP 3 A 4) P 450 s expressed within intact Escherichia coli revealed that both Fe(III) and Fe(II) forms of the enzyme are present in the absence of substrates. The relevance of this finding was supported by similar observations of Fe(II) P 450 heme in intact rat hepatocytes. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of the bacterial forms in intact cells showed that a proportion of the P 450 in cells was in an EPR-silent form in the native state consistent with the presence of Fe(II) P 450. Coexpression of suitable cognate electron donors increased the degree of endogenous reduction to over 80 %. A significant proportion of intracellular P 450 remained in the Fe(II) form after vigorous <b>aeration</b> of <b>cells.</b> The addition of substrates increased the proportion of Fe(II) heme, suggesting a kinetic gate to heme reduction in the absence of substrate. In summary, these observations suggest that the resting state of P 450 s should be regarded as a mixture of Fe(III) and Fe(II) forms in both aerobic and oxygen-limited conditions...|$|R
