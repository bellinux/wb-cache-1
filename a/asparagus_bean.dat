It can be adapted to a wide range of environmental stimuli such as drought and heat. Nevertheless, it is an extremely cold-sensitive tropical species. Improvement of chilling tolerance in <b>asparagus</b> <b>bean</b> may significantly increase its production and prolong its supply. However, gene regulation and signaling pathways related to cold response in this crop remain unknown. Using Illumina sequencing technology, modification of global gene expression in response to chilling stress in two <b>asparagus</b> <b>bean</b> cultivars-"Dubai bean" and "Ningjiang- 3 ", which are tolerant and sensitive to chilling, respectively-were investigated. More than 1. 8 million clean reads were obtained from each sample. After de novo assembly, 88, 869 unigenes were finally generated with a mean length of 635 bp. Of these unigenes, 41, 925 (47. 18 %) had functional annotations when aligned to public protein databases. Further, we identified 3, 510 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Dubai bean, including 2, 103 up-regulated genes and 1, 407 down-regulated genes. While in Ningjiang- 3, we found 2, 868 DEGs, 1, 786 of which were increasing and the others were decreasing. 1, 744 DEGs were commonly regulated in two cultivars, suggesting that some genes play fundamental roles in <b>asparagus</b> <b>bean</b> during cold stress. Functional classification of the DEGs in two cultivars using Mercator pipeline indicated that RNA, protein, signaling, stress and hormone metabolism were five major groups.

The level and genetic variability of FW resistance in the Chinese <b>asparagus</b> <b>bean</b> germplasm remains elusive. In the current study, FW resistance was assessed across a natural population consisting of 95 <b>asparagus</b> <b>bean</b> and four African cowpea [(L.) Walp. subsp. Unguiculata Group] accessions. The disease index (DI) based on the severity of leaf damage (LFD) and vascular discoloration (VD) varied highly across the population and the highly resistant varieties used for vegetable are very limited. Genome-wide association study identified 11 and seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) {{that are associated with}} LFD and VD traits, respectively. These SNPs were distributed on nine linkage groups of the <b>asparagus</b> <b>bean</b> genome and each accounted for less than 5 % of the phenotypic variation. Overall, the nonstandard vegetable (NSV) subgene pool harbors favorable alleles in a higher frequency than the standard vegetable (SV) subgene pool. Individual NSV-type accessions tend to possess a greater number of favorable alleles than the SV-type ones.

In order {{to explore the}} genetic variation of drought responses in <b>asparagus</b> <b>bean,</b> we conducted multi-year phenotyping of drought resistance traits across the Chinese <b>asparagus</b> <b>bean</b> mini-core. The phenotypic distribution indicated that the ssp. sesquipedalis subgene pool has maintained high natural variation in drought responses despite known domestic bottleneck. Thirty-nine SNP loci were found to show an association with drought resistance via a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Whole-plant water relations were compared among four genotypes by lysimetric assay. Apparent genotypic differences in transpiration patterns and the critical soil water threshold in relation to dehydration avoidance were observed, indicating a delicate adaptive mechanism for each genotype to its own climate. Microarray gene expression analyses revealed that known drought resistance pathways such as the ABA and phosphate lipid signaling pathways are conserved between genotypes, while differential regulation of certain aquaporin genes and hormonal genes may be important for the genotypic differences. Our results suggest that divergent sensitivity to soil water content is an important mechanism configuring the genotypic specific responses to water deficit.

40|$|Salt stress {{responses}} of 23 <b>asparagus</b> <b>bean</b> cultivars were evaluated using 14 -day-old seedlings after 15 -day exposure to 75 mM NaCl in a hydroponics culture system. Salt-induced changes in plant growth and morphology, photosynthetic capacity, cell membrane integrity, and cellular protection enzyme systems {{as well as}} other physiological and biochemical traits were investigated to identify genotypic variability in salt response. This study also analyzed heredity parameters and correlation of the salt response index (SRI). Salt stress suppressed seedling growth and simultaneously reduced leaf area, content of chlorophyll and soluble proteins, net assimilation rate, as well as dry matter accumulation. In contrast, leaf blade cell membrane relative permeability, content of malondialdehyde, and antioxidant enzyme activity were elevated after salt treatment. Analysis of the heredity parameters has identified that the 18 investigated traits have different genotypic variance of the SRI values. Based on Ward’s distances estimated for the sum of square variance in the SRI values, all the cultivars were classified into 2 discrete salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive clusters.

40|$|Background and Aims: Coordination {{of sugar}} {{transport}} and metabolism between developing seeds and their enclosing fruit tissues is little understood. In this study the physiological mechanism is examined using two genotypes of <b>asparagus</b> <b>bean</b> (Vigna unguiculata ssp. sesquipedialis) differing in pod wall and seed growth rates. Pod growth dominates over seed growth in genotype ‘Zhijiang 121 ’ {{but not in}} ‘Zhijiang 282 ’ in which a ‘bulging pod’ phenotype is apparent from 8 d post-anthesis (dpa) onward. Methods: Seed and pod wall growth rates and degree of pod-bulging were measured in the two genotypes together with assays of activities of sucrose-degrading enzymes and sugar content in pod wall and seed and evaluation of cellular pathways of phloem unloading in seed coat using a symplasmic fluorescent dye, 5 (6) -carboxyfluorescein (CF). Key Results: Activities of cell wall, cytoplasmic and vacuolar invertases (CWIN, CIN and VIN) were significantly smaller in pod walls of ‘ 282 ’ than in ‘ 121 ’ at 10 dpa onwards. Low INV activities were associated with weak pod wall growth of ‘ 282 ’. In seed coats, CF was confined within the vasculature in ‘ 282 ’ but moved beyond the vasculature in ‘ 121 ’, indicating apoplasmic and symplasmic phloem unloading, respectively. Higher CWIN activity in ‘ 282 ’ seed coats at 6 – 8 dpa correlated with high hexose concentration in embryos and enhanced early seed growth. However, CWIN activity in ‘ 282 ’ decreased significantly compared with ‘ 121 ’ from 10 dpa onwards, coinciding with earlier commencement of nuclei endoreduplication in their embryos. Conclusions: The study shows genotypic differences between ‘bulging pod’ and ‘non-bulging’ phenotypes of <b>asparagus</b> <b>bean</b> in sucrose metabolism {{in relation to the}} pathway of phloem unloading in developing seed coats, and to pod and seed growth. Low INV activity in pod wall corresponds to its shortened and weak growth period; by contrast, the apoplasmic path in the seed coat is associated with high CWIN activity and strong early seed growth...|$|E

30|$|No elite {{genotype}} fell in {{the dark}} coat coloured cluster (Figure  3). Commercial varieties of cowpea are mainly white or brown to red coat coloured in Ghana as they are the types preferred by consumers (Quaye et al. 2011; Langyintuo et al. 2003). Separation of many Ghanaian accessions away from elite and commercial varieties may mean availability of diversity that could be exploited for cowpea improvement. Despite claims of limited genetic variation in cowpea (Asare et al. 2010; Kumar et al. 2011 Tan et al. 2012), there is substantial morphological and genetic evidence that cowpea is a very diverse taxon (Huynh et al. 2013).
