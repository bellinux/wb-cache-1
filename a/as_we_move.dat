25|$|Note {{that on the}} {{interval}} AB there is an odd number of borders colored 1-2 (simply because A is colored 1, B is colored 2; and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>move</b> along AB, {{there must be an}} odd number of color changes in order to get different colors at the beginning and at the end). Therefore, the vertex of G corresponding to the outer area has an odd degree. But it is known (the handshaking lemma) that in a finite graph there is an even number of vertices with odd degree. Therefore, the remaining graph, excluding the outer area, has an odd number of vertices with odd degree corresponding to members of T.|$|E
25|$|The Dravidian {{language}} {{influenced the}} Indo-Aryan languages. Dravidian languages show extensive lexical (vocabulary) borrowing, {{but only a}} few traits of structural (either phonological or grammatical) borrowing from Indo-Aryan, whereas Indo-Aryan shows more structural than lexical borrowings from the Dravidian languages. Many of these features are already present in the oldest known Indo-Aryan language, the language of the Rigveda (c. 1500 BCE), which also includes over a dozen words borrowed from Dravidian. The linguistic evidence for Dravidian impact grows increasingly strong <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>move</b> from the Samhitas down through the later Vedic works and into the classical post-Vedic literature. This represents an early religious and cultural fusion or synthesis between ancient Dravidians and Indo-Aryans.|$|E

25|$|The {{northern}} Atlantic coast has warm summers (28°C to 32°C, {{but with}} relatively cool nights at 15°C) and mild winters, with highs of about 12°C and lows about 2–3°C. Occasionally, temperatures reach −10°C or 40°C, and rainfall is very scarce. It only gets a bit colder further south in Chubut, {{and the city}} of Comodoro Rivadavia has summer temperatures of 24°C to 28°C, nights of 12°C to 16°C, and winters with days around 10°C and nights around 3°C, and less than 250mm of rain. However, there is a drastic drop <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>move</b> south to Santa Cruz: Rio Gallegos, in the south of the province, has summer temps of 17°C to 21°C, (nights between 6°C and 10°C) and winter temperatures of 2°C to 6°C, with nights between −5°C and 0°C despite being right on the coast. Snowfall is common despite the dryness, and temperatures are known to fall to under −18°C and to remain below freezing for several days in a row. Rio Gallegos is also among the windiest places on Earth, with winds reaching 100km h occasionally.|$|E

2500|$|If {{the source}} {{impedance}} remains constant and the fault current changes appreciably <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>move</b> {{away from the}} [...] relay then it is advantageous to use IDMT overcurrent protection to achieve high speed protection over a large section of the protected circuit. However, if the source impedance is significantly larger than the feeder impedance then the characteristic of the IDMT relay cannot be exploited and DTOC may be utilized. [...] Secondly if the source impedance varies and becomes weaker with less generation during light loads then this leads to slower clearance time hence negating {{the purpose of the}} IDMT relay.|$|E

2500|$|At Citi's 2012 annual shareholders' {{meeting on}} April 17, Citi's {{executive}} compensation package was rejected, with approximately 55% {{of the votes}} being against approval. The non-binding vote was required under the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires corporations to hold advisory shareholder votes on their executive compensation plans. Many shareholders expressed concerns about Citi's failed 2012 Fed stress test and lack of long-term performance-based metrics in its executive compensation plan. One {{of the largest and}} most activist of the shareholders voting no, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, stated Citi [...] "has not anchored rewards to performance". A Citigroup shareholder filed a lawsuit days after the vote, claiming Citi executives breached their fiduciary duties. In response, Richard Parsons, former chairman of Citigroup, called the vote a [...] "serious matter". A spokeswoman for Citi said [...] "Citi's Board of Directors takes the shareholder vote seriously, and along with senior management will consult with representative shareholders to understand their concerns" [...] and that the Compensation committee of the Board [...] "will carefully consider their (shareholder) input <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>move</b> forward".|$|E

The Agamas are non-Vedic in origin [...] and have been dated either as post-Vedic texts [...] or as pre-Vedic compositions. The Agamas are a collection of Tamil and Sanskrit scriptures chiefly constituting the methods of temple construction and creation of murti, worship means of deities, philosophical doctrines, meditative practices, attainment of sixfold desires and four kinds of yoga. The worship of tutelary deities, sacred flora and fauna in Hinduism is also recognized as a survival of the pre-Vedic Dravidian religion.

2500|$|The human tongue has {{an unusual}} shape. In most mammals, it's a long, flat {{structure}} contained largely within the mouth. It is attached {{at the rear}} to the hyoid bone, situated below oral level in the pharynx. In humans, the tongue has an almost circular sagittal (midline) contour, much of it lying vertically down an extended pharynx, where it {{is attached to a}} hyoid bone in a lowered position. Partly as a result of this, the horizontal (inside-the-mouth) and vertical (down-the-throat) tubes forming the supralaryngeal vocal tract (SVT) are almost equal in length (whereas in other species, the vertical section is shorter). <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>move</b> our jaws up and down, the tongue can vary the cross-sectional area of each tube independently by about 10:1, altering formant frequencies accordingly. That the tubes are joined at a right angle permits pronunciation of the vowels , [...] and , which nonhuman primates cannot do. Even when not performed particularly accurately, in humans the articulatory gymnastics needed to distinguish these vowels yield consistent, distinctive acoustic results, illustrating the quantal nature of human speech sounds. It may not be coincidental that , [...] and [...] are the most common vowels in the world's languages.|$|E
2500|$|It is the Soviet Union {{that runs}} against {{the tide of}} history by denying human freedom and human dignity to its citizens. It also is in deep {{economic}} difficulty. The rate {{of growth in the}} national product has been steadily declining since the fifties and is less than half of what it was then. The dimensions of this failure are astounding: A country which employs one-fifth of its population in agriculture is unable to feed its own people. Were it not for the private sector, the tiny private sector tolerated in Soviet agriculture, the country might be on the brink of famine.... Overcentralized, with little or no incentives, year after year the Soviet system pours its best resource into the making of instruments of destruction. The constant shrinkage of economic growth combined with the growth of military production is putting a heavy strain on the Soviet people. What we see here is a political structure that no longer corresponds to its economic base, a society where productive forces are hampered by political ones. ...In the Communist world as well, man's instinctive desire for freedom and self-determination surfaces again and again. To be sure, there are grim reminders of how brutally the police state attempts to snuff out this quest for self-rule – 1953 in East Germany, 1956 in Hungary, 1968 in Czechoslovakia, 1981 in Poland. But the struggle continues in Poland. And {{we know that there are}} even those who strive and suffer for freedom within the confines of the Soviet Union itself. ...What I am describing now is a plan and a hope for the long term – the march of freedom and democracy which will leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash heap of history as it has left other tyrannies which stifle the freedom and muzzle the self-expression of the people. And that's why we must continue our efforts to strengthen NATO even <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>move</b> forward with our Zero-Option initiative in the negotiations on intermediate-range forces and our proposal for a one-third reduction in strategic ballistic missile warheads." ...|$|E
