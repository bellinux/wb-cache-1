5|$|Costa scored his tenth goal of {{the league}} season to give Chelsea a 2–1 win away to Liverpool on 8 November, {{preserving}} their unbeaten start to the campaign.

Costa won his first trophy for Chelsea on 1 March, as they defeated Tottenham Hotspur 2–0 to win the League Cup at Wembley Stadium; he scored the second {{goal of the}} game.|$|E

5|$|Barnes {{brought along}} half a tonne of baggage {{on the sea}} voyage to England, {{including}} {{a lot of food}} and drink, particularly alcohol, which was scarce due to the war and subject to rationing. There Barnes would sell his goods. During the journey, the players had to sign autographs on 5,000 sheets of paper with the team list. Barnes had <b>a</b> <b>stamp</b> of his signature made, and paid a young boy drinks to deal with the sheets, but he landed himself in trouble with captain Don Bradman and manager Keith Johnson when the boy stamped the sheets erratically, sometimes not adjacent to Barnes's position on the team list.|$|E
5|$|From 1840 to 1844, the Penny Black, {{and other}} stamps issued, were obliterated with the Maltese Cross cancellation. There was no text or numeral to help {{identify}} any of these cancels as Irish, but some Maltese Crosses are uniquely identifiable with certain Irish towns, including Belfast, Eyrecourt, Cork, Hollymount, Limerick and Mullingar. From 1844 on, the cancels used included text or numerals that identified the post town. Cancels of both types are easier to identify if the stamp is still affixed to a cover, since this makes the complete postmark visible, but <b>a</b> <b>stamp</b> no longer affixed to a cover may still permit identification {{of the town of}} use if enough of the postmark can be seen on the stamp itself. Numerals of Irish town cancels were uniquely set in a 4 pointed diamond shape whereas town cancels in England and Wales used an oval shape and Scotland used a rectangular form.|$|E
5|$|In 1765, Parliament {{passed the}} Stamp Act which {{required}} colonists {{to pay a}} new tax on most printed materials. News of {{the passage of the}} Stamp Act produced an uproar in the colonies. The colonial response echoed Adams's 1764 instructions. In June 1765, Otis called for <b>a</b> <b>Stamp</b> Act Congress to coordinate colonial resistance. The Virginia House of Burgesses passed a widely reprinted set of resolves against the Stamp Act that resembled Adams's arguments against the Sugar Act. Adams argued that the Stamp Act was unconstitutional; he also believed that it would hurt the economy of the British Empire. He supported calls for a boycott of British goods to put pressure on Parliament to repeal the tax.|$|E
