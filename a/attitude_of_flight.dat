The configuration of the sensor consists of two MEMS sensing elements and signal processing circuit and micro-processor.

The <b>attitude</b> <b>of</b> the experienced <b>Flight</b> operations personnel given this duty has been and remains one of insuring that the PI's experiment is allowed to be placed on the aircraft (facility) and can be operated in a manner that will obtain the expected data.

40|$|A new {{airborne}} tandem measurement {{platform for}} cloud-radiation interaction studies is introduced in this paper. It {{consists of a}} Learjet 35 A research aircraft and the AIRcraft TOwed Sensor Shuttle (AIRTOSS), which is an instrumented drag-body towed by the Learjet. Currently, the AIRTOSS is instrumented with a Cloud Imaging Probe (CIP) for measuring cloud microphysical properties and an Inertial Navigation System (INS) for measurements <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attitudes.</b> The cable dragging AIRTOSS can be as long as four kilometres. Thus, truly collocated measurements in two altitudes above, in, and below clouds can be obtained. Results from first test flights with Learjet and AIRTOSS are reported here. The flights were performed from Hohn Airport, Germany. Specific manoeuvres were flown to test the aerodynamic behaviour of the drag-body and to investigate the suitability of AIRTOSS for high-precision irradiance measurements which require a stable <b>flight</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>of</b> AIRTOSS. The <b>flight</b> <b>attitude</b> data show that AIRTOSS is sensitive to several flight manoeuvres such as curves, altitude and airspeed changes, and also to changes of towing cable length. The effects of these manoeuvres on the <b>attitude</b> angles <b>of</b> AIRTOSS have been quantified. Maximum roll angle deviations were observed during curve flight. Even small changes in heading can lead to high roll angles (one degree change in heading causes a change in roll angle of about eight degrees). The pitch angle varies during climb or dive periods, extending or retracting of towing cable, acceleration or deceleration, and even when flying at too low or too high true airspeed depending on altitude. Values of pitch angle between &minus; 5 &deg; (dive) and 8 &deg; (climb and retracting towing cable) have been observed. While change in attitude is not problematic for cloud particle property measurements it is for radiation measurements. Here, the deviation from the horizontal should {{be no more than}} 3 &deg; to avoid large errors. When keeping the above mentioned flight parameters constant, sufficiently stable flight conditions can be maintained to perform high-quality irradiance measurements with AIRTOSS in future experiments. During this test campaign also observations of cloud microphysical data as for example droplet number concentrations and size distributions with the AIRTOSS in stratocumulus clouds were performed to prove the compliance with scientific needs. Simultaneous radiation measurements of the clouds have been made. The measurements of internal operational data of AIRTOSS as well as the first atmospheric data demonstrate the suitability of this tandem platform for detailed cloud microphysics and radiation interaction studies...|$|R

An impact bag was attached below the large end of the capsule to absorb initial impact loads and a second bag was attached around the canister to absorb loads resulting from impact on the canister when the capsule overturned. A 1 / 6 -scale dynamic model of the configuration was tested for nominal <b>flight</b> paths <b>of</b> 60 deg. and 90 deg. (vertical), a range <b>of</b> contact <b>attitudes</b> from - 25 deg. to 30 deg., and a vertical contact velocity of 12. 25 feet per second. Accelerations were measured along the X-axis (roll) and Z-axis (yaw) by accelerometers rigidly installed at the center of gravity of the model. Actual flight path, contact attitudes, and motions were determined from high-speed motion pictures. Landings were made on concrete and on water. The peak accelerations along the X-axis for landings on concrete were in the order of 3 Og for a 0 deg. contact attitude. A horizontal velocity of 7 feet per second, corresponding to a <b>flight</b> path <b>of</b> 60 deg., had very little effect upon the peak accelerations obtained for landings on concrete. For contact <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> - 25 deg. and 30 deg. the peak accelerations along the Z-axis were about +/- l 5 g, respectively. The peak accelerations measured for the water landings were about one-third lower than the peak accelerations measured for the landings on concrete.
