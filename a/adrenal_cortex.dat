5|$|Adrenal {{insufficiency}} (the {{deficiency of}} glucocorticoids) occurs in about 5 in 10,000 {{in the general}} population.

5|$|The {{outermost}} {{zone of the}} <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex</b> is the zona glomerulosa. It lies immediately {{under the}} fibrous capsule of the gland.

5|$|In {{secondary}} adrenal insufficiency, a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis {{leads to}} decreased {{stimulation of the}} <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex.</b> Apart from suppression of the axis by glucocorticoid therapy, {{the most common cause}} of secondary adrenal insufficiency are tumors that affect the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland. This type of adrenal insufficiency usually does not affect the production of mineralocorticoids, which are under regulation of the renin-angiotensin system instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} (also known as suprarenal glands) are {{endocrine}} glands that produce {{a variety of}} hormones including adrenaline and the steroids aldosterone and cortisol. They are found above the kidneys. Each gland has an outer cortex which produces steroid hormones and an inner medulla. The <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex</b> itself {{is divided into three}} zones: zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis.|$|E

Up to day 15 of fetal development, the cells exhibited characteristics of primordial germ cells. At day 17, and irrespective of the sex of the fetus, they all entered meiosis in synchrony with those in the ovary. Postnatally, in females as well as males, all ectopic germ cells displayed morphologic characteristics identical to those of young oocytes in unilaminar ovarian follicles. No germinal elements were seen in the adrenal glands past day 12 of life.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of imaging the adrenal glands during routine upper abdominal examinations was studied for 100 consecutive patients, 47 males and 53 females. The mean patient age was 46 {{years and the}} mean weight 63 kg. The suprarenal areas were scanned in a slightly oblique frontal plane through the intercostal spaces with the patient recumbent. The right adrenal gland was detected in 92 per cent of the patients, with a mean examination time of less than one minute. Visualization of the left adrenal gland was more difficult and was successful in only 71 per cent, even where additional views in the right lateral decubitus or erect position were added. The mean examination time on the left was 2 1 / 2 minutes. Complete visualization of the adrenal gland is impossible in one single plane because of the complex shape of the organ, which necessitates multiple contiguous scan planes.

5|$|Addison's disease {{refers to}} primary hypoadrenalism, {{which is a}} {{deficiency}} in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production by the adrenal gland. In the Western world, Addison's disease is most commonly an autoimmune condition, in which the body produces antibodies against cells of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex.</b> Worldwide, the disease is more frequently caused by infection, especially from tuberculosis. A distinctive feature of Addison's disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue.|$|E
5|$|Catecholamines are {{produced}} in chromaffin {{cells in the}} medulla of the adrenal gland, from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA in {{the first step of}} catecholamine synthesis. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine before it can be turned into noradrenaline. In the cytosol, noradrenaline is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in granules. Glucocorticoids produced in the <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex</b> stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.|$|E
5|$|Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} is a congenital {{disease in}} which mutations of enzymes that produce steroid hormones {{result in a}} glucocorticoid deficiency and malfunction of the negative feedback loop of the HPA axis. In the HPA axis, cortisol (a glucocorticoid) inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH, hormones that in turn stimulate corticosteroid synthesis. As cortisol cannot be synthesized, these hormones are released in high quantities and stimulate production of other adrenal steroids instead. The {{most common form of}} congenital adrenal hyperplasia is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase is necessary for production of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, but not androgens. Therefore, ACTH stimulation of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex</b> induces the release of excessive amounts of adrenal androgens, which can lead to the development of ambiguous genitalia and secondary sex characteristics.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Hypercortisolism {{the most}} common {{endocrine}} disease in dogs. Chronic elevated plasma levels of cortisol result in clinical signs such as polyuria and polydipsia, polyphagia and alopecia. One of the causes for cortisol expression is an adrenocortical tumor (AT). So far, {{it was believed that}} AT secrete cortisol independently from the pituitary and ACTH. However, human research has shown that there is expression of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and its precursor POMC in the tumors. In this research, the expression of POMC in ATs in dogs was studied in 26 carcinomas and 12 adenomas. For comparison also 15 normal <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortexes</b> served as control. Materials and methods: RT-PCR was performed on all the adrenal tissue samples. PCR products have been sequenced. After this, a qPCR was performed. Finally immunohistochemistry was done. Results: In the PCR, POMC expression was found in different samples, in both ATs and normal adrenal tissue. qPCR gave no reliable results. Results of the immunohistochemistry seemed to match with the results of the PCR, except for the normal tissue slides...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³) is {{produced}} by activated T and NK lymphoid cells, mononuclear cells, and macrophage and dendritic cells. Our previous {{studies have shown that}} IFN-Î³-like immunoreactivity also appears in human adrenal cortical tumour and phaeochromocytoma. To investigate whether human tumour cells can produce IFN-Î³, we examined 429 biopsy specimens of 30 kinds of tumour and tumour-surrounding tissues in adrenal glands and in kidneys by using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation. IFN-Î³ immunoactivity was shown in 34. 3 % of the adrenal cortical adenomas, 50 % of the adrenal cortical carcinomas, 26. 7 % of the phaeochromocytomas, 26. 7 % of the clear cell renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), 22 % of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortexes</b> and 40 % of medullas adjacent to tumours. The positive samples and expression areas were well overlapped between the IFN-Î³ mRNA and the immunohistochemistry staining. Western blot analysis has further confirmed the immunohistochemistry results by showing a distinct IFN-Î³ band corresponding to 17. 4 [*]kDa in tissue extracts from adrenal cortical adenoma, phaeochromocytoma and clear cell RCCs. These results indicate that IFN-Î³ is produced by some types of tumour cells, suggesting it may play a dual {{role in the development of}} these tumours...|$|R
40|$|Telomerase {{was found}} in cancers and immortalized cell lines, but only {{occasionally}} in normal tissues, thus suggesting that measurement of its hTERT subunit might help distinguishing benign from malignant tumors. Data on hTERT expression in adrenocortical tumors are scant and mostly confined to non-functioning tumors. Therefore, we investigated whether hTERT expression may predict malignancy in aldosterone producing adrenocortical tumors. We measured hTERT mRNA with a real-time one-step reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, based {{on the use of}} hTERT-specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probes, in 19 adrenalectomized patients with aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs), in whom long-term follow-up (median 7 years, range 5 - 14 years) data were available. We also studied two rare aldosterone-producing carcinomas (APCs), eight adrenocortical carcinomas (ACs), twelve normal <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortexes,</b> and two malignant cell lines (NCI- 295 H and SW- 13). Telomerase activity and hTERT immunoreactivity were also investigated. Of interest, we detected hTERT mRNA in 58 % of APAs at levels similar to those of malignant tumors, which all consistently showed hTERT expression. In hTERT expressing tumors, immunocytochemistry showed the nuclear expression of hTERT. No hTERT expression {{was found in}} the normal adrenocortical tissue. No histopathology differences were observed between hTERT-positive and -negative APAs; however, a patient originally held to have an hTERT-positive APA was retrospectively classified as APC because of metastatic spread. In conclusion, RT-PCR measurement of hTERT mRNA is a hallmark of malignant adrenocortical tumors, but identifies also a subset of hTERT-expressing APAs that might show metastatic spread at long-term follow-u...|$|R
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognized}} works on the adrenal glands came in 1855 {{with the publication of}} On the Constitutional and Local Effects of Disease of the Suprarenal Capsule, by the English physician Thomas Addison. In his monography, Addison described what the French physician George Trousseau would later name Addison's disease, an eponym still used today for a condition of adrenal insufficiency and its related clinical manifestations. In 1894, English physiologists George Oliver and Edward Schafer studied the action of adrenal extracts and observed their pressor effects. In the following decades several physicians experimented with extracts from the <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex</b> to treat Addison's disease. Edward Calvin Kendall, Philip Hench and Tadeusz Reichstein were then awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries on the structure and effects of the adrenal hormones.|$|E
5|$|The <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex</b> {{produces}} {{three main}} types of steroid hormones: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. Mineralocorticoids (such as aldosterone) {{produced in the}} zona glomerulosa help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone are synthesized in the zona fasciculata; their functions include the regulation of metabolism and immune system suppression. The innermost layer of the cortex, the zona reticularis, produces androgens that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs. The production of steroid hormones is called steroidogenesis, and involves a number of reactions and processes {{that take place in}} cortical cells. The medulla produces the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, which function to produce a rapid response throughout the body in stress situations.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is derived from}} neural crest cells, which come from the {{ectoderm}} layer of the embryo. These cells migrate from their initial position and aggregate {{in the vicinity of}} the dorsal aorta, a primitive blood vessel, which activates the differentiation of these cells through the release of proteins known as BMPs. These cells then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form the adrenal medulla and other organs of the sympathetic nervous system. Cells of the adrenal medulla are called chromaffin cells because they contain granules that stain with chromium salts, a characteristic not present in all sympathetic organs. Glucocorticoids produced in the <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex</b> were once thought to be responsible for the differentiation of chromaffin cells. More recent research suggests that BMP-4 secreted in adrenal tissue is the main responsible for this, and that glucocorticoids only play a role in the subsequent development of the cells.|$|E
40|$|Orexins A and B are {{hypothalamic}} peptides, {{that act}} via two subtypes of receptors, named OX 1 -R and OX 2 -R. Rat and human <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortexes</b> {{are provided with}} both OX 1 -R and OX 2 -R, and we have previously shown that orexin-A, but not orexin-B, enhances glucocorticoid secretion from dispersed adrenocortical cells. Since OX 1 -Rs preferentially bind orexin-A and OX 2 -Rs are non-selective for both orexins, the hypothesis has been advanced that the secretagogue effect of orexin-A is exclusively mediated by the OX 1 -R. Here, we aimed to verify this contention and to gain insight into the signaling mechanism(s) underlying the secretagogue effect of orexins using primary cultures of rat and human adrenocortical cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that cultured cells, as freshly dispersed cells, expressed both OX 1 -R and OX 2 -R mRNAs. Orexin-A, but not orexin-B, concentration-dependently increased corticosterone and cortisol secretion from cultured rat and human adrenocortical cells, respectively. The blockade of OX 1 -Rs by selective antibodies abrogated the secretagogue effect of orexin-A, while the immuno-blockade of OX 2 -Rs was ineffective. The glucocorticoid response of cultured cells to orexin-A was annulled by the adenylate cyclase and protein kinase (PK) A inhibitors SQ- 22536 and H- 89, and unaffected by the phospholipase C and PKC inhibitors U- 73122 and calphostin-C. Orexin-A, but not orexin-B, enhanced cyclic-AMP production from cultured cells, and did not alter inositol- 3 -phosphate release. Collectively, our present results allow us to conclude that orexins stimulate glucocorticoid secretion from rat and human adrenocortical cells, exclusively acting through OX 1 -Rs coupled to the adenylate cyclase/PKA-dependent signaling cascad...|$|R

25|$|DHEA is {{produced}} in the zona reticularis of the <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex</b> {{under the control of}} adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and by the gonads under the control of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).

It is derived mostly from the <b>adrenal</b> <b>cortex,</b> with only about 10% being secreted from the gonads. Approximately 50 to 70% of circulating DHEA originates from desulfation of DHEA-S in peripheral tissues.

40|$|Glucocorticoids, hormones {{produced}} by the <b>adrenal</b> gland <b>cortex,</b> exert numerous functions in body homeostasis and {{the response of the}} organism to external stressors. One striking feature of their regulation is a diurnal release pattern, with peak levels linked {{to the start of the}} activity phase. This release is under control of the circadian clock, an endogenous biological timekeeper which acts to prepare the organism for daily changes in its environment. Circadian control of glucocorticoid production and secretion involves a central pacemaker in the hypothalamus, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, as well as a circadian clock in the adrenal gland itself. Central circadian regulation is mediated via the hypothalamic-pituitaryâadrenal axis and the autonomic nervous system, while the adrenal gland clock appears to control sensitivity of the gland to the adrenocorticotropic hormone ACTH. The rhythmically released glucocorticoids in turn might contribute to synchronisation of the cell autonomous clocks in the body and interact with them to time physiological dynamics in their target tissues around the day...|$|R

In vivo biodistribution indicated high uptake in adrenals (5. 4), heart (1. 5), lungs (1. 5), kidney (1. 5) %ID/g at 6 h p. i. In the central nervous system (CNS), the olfactory bulbs displayed the highest uptake; up to six times the activity in blood. Preadministration of unlabeled CLINDE, PK 11195 and Ro 5 â 4864 (1 mg/kg) reduced the uptake of [123 I]-CLINDE by 70 â 55 % in olfactory bulbs.
