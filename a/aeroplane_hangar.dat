Duke of York opened fire {{at a range}} of [...] and scored a hit on the first salvo disabling Scharnhorsts foremost turrets ("Anton" [...] and [...] "Bruno") while another salvo destroyed the ship's <b>aeroplane</b> <b>hangar.</b> Bey turned north, but was engaged by the cruisers Norfolk and Belfast, and turned east at a high speed of [...]|$|E
50|$|BICC also {{designed}} an interesting type of transportable <b>aeroplane</b> <b>hangar</b> {{in the late}} 1930s for military use. Although not ordered in quantity by the Air Ministry, {{a number of these}} Callendar-Hamilton hangars were built in Britain in the late 1930s and early years of World War II. These are easily recognisable from the more numerous contemporary Bellman and T-type hangars by their intricate internal framework and external overhead door rails. Preserved examples - now listed - of these hangars can be seen today at the Museum of Flight at East Fortune near Edinburgh.|$|E
5000|$|In a 1970 {{episode of}} Monty Python's Flying Circus, {{there was a}} fake news profile of a crime lord named Dinsdale Piranha, a notorious {{criminal}} known for nailing people's heads to the floor. Piranha believed a giant invisible hedgehog named [...] "Spiny Norman" [...] was following him everywhere, {{and when he came}} to believe Spiny Norman was hiding out in an <b>aeroplane</b> <b>hangar,</b> he blew the hangar up with a nuclear bomb. During the closing credits of the show, Spiny Norman is seen stalking London and shouting [...] "Dinsdale!" ...|$|E

25|$|On 13 August 1918, Lt. Hamilton led {{his flight}} {{on a special}} mission against Varssenaere aerodrome. He dropped four bombs from 200 feet on some <b>aeroplane</b> <b>hangars,</b> making two direct hits and causing {{a large amount of}} damage. He then machine gunned the German officers' billets and made four {{circuits}} of the aerodrome, shooting up various targets. On the first circuit, he destroyed one EA on the ground which burst into flames when he shot it up. On the third circuit he repeated this performance, setting afire another Fokker biplane. His dash and skill very materially helped in the success of the operation. In addition this officer destroyed a Fokker biplane over Armenti√®res on 7 August 1918. On 12 July he brought down two EA in flames and on two other occasions has driven down out of control enemy machines. He is an excellent patrol leader.|$|R
50|$|Royal Air Force Station Hinaidi was a British Royal Air Force station near Baghdad in the Kingdom of Iraq.It was {{established}} {{as the main}} British base in Iraq after World War I, initially under British Army command until the Royal Air Force took over in 1922. There were extensive barracks, recreational facilities, a large hospital, air headquarters, communication facilities, maintenance units, <b>aeroplane</b> squadron <b>hangars,</b> RAF Armoured Car Company lines and a civil cantonment. Many British personnel still lie buried in the RAF Cemetery (the Peace Cemetery, now derelict) at Hinaidi. The register of those buried is held by the RAF Habbaniya Association.|$|R
5000|$|In 1929, the {{facilities}} were {{described by the}} S.C.F.C. {{in one of their}} publications as follows: Niagara District Airport, established and operated by Haney Repair Service of St. Catharines, comprises about 100 acres and is located immediately south of Canada's busiest provincial highway, No. 8, three miles east of St. Catharines and adjacent to the great Welland Ship Canal.Though only three months under preparation it affords 2,400-ft. runways in all directions except east and west, where, {{due to the fact that}} the field's location in relation to the Niagara Escarpment, makes direct east and west winds almost impossible. A temporary length of 1,200 feet has been prepared.A light <b>aeroplane</b> <b>hangar</b> has been constructed, Hydro power and telephone installed and gasoline and oil servicing facilities are conveniently located.The port has a 1,200 ft. highway frontage with a 300 ft. approach and the Airport Inn at this approach. Excellent dining rooms, refreshment stand, tourist hut and dancing services are always available at the Inn and buses taken at convenient intervals for all points from Buffalo to Toronto.Being located adjacent to the Welland Ship Canal, one mile from the main line of the C.N.R. National Railway, three-quarters of a mile from the Queenston Hydro power lines, and in the very centre of the Peninsula's three largest adjacent communities (St. Catharines, Merritton and Thorold) it offers aviation industry all that could be desired and being only one mile from the half-hourly radial service which serves every community on both sides of the Niagara River, it offers easy access to the airways of Canada and the United States.By arrangement of a grant by the City of St. Catharines covering the club's rental, the St. Catharines Flying Club can operate gratia from the field for a period of five years. Aeronautical Services Ltd. distributors of Curtiss Reid for Lincoln, Welland and Wentworth Counties, also make it their headquarters.|$|E
60|$|And now a word {{as to the}} {{personality}} of the author of this epoch-making statement. Joyce-Armstrong, according to the few friends who really knew something of the man, was a poet and a dreamer, as well as a mechanic and an inventor. He was a man of considerable wealth, much of which he had spent in the pursuit of his aeronautical hobby. He had four private <b>aeroplanes</b> in his <b>hangars</b> near Devizes, and is said to have made no fewer than one hundred and seventy ascents in the course of last year. He was a retiring man with dark moods, in which he would avoid the society of his fellows. Captain Dangerfield, who knew him better than any one, says that there were times when his eccentricity threatened to develop into something more serious. His habit of carrying a shot-gun with him in his aeroplane was one manifestation of it.|$|R
50|$|The {{first half}} of the scenes {{featuring}} the flight were shot inside a Douglas DC-3 <b>aeroplane</b> in a <b>hangar</b> in Essendon. A real DC-3 was used to make the scenes look as realistic as possible. Filming inside the cabin was not easy as it was small and cramped, especially once the camera and lighting crews were inside. During filming, the actors who were in the shot were the only ones on board. Once their scenes were shot, they disembarked and their places taken by their co-stars. The camera crew also had to take out seats to be able to shoot from different angles. As the DC-3 was static in the hangar, special effects were added in post-production {{to make it look like}} it was moving. To create the effect of the explosion, strobe lights and smoke were used, while the cast had to throw themselves around the cabin.|$|R
