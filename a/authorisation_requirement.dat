50|$|Mrs Geraets-Smits {{claimed the}} refusal of {{reimbursement}} for treatment for Parkinson’s disease in Kassel, which she believed was better than that available in the Netherlands by focusing on individual symptoms, was contrary to TFEU article 56. Mr Peerbooms received neurostimulation treatment in Innsbruck, which likewise {{would not have been}} covered in the Netherlands. Experts testified in both cases that it was unjustified or experimental. Dutch social insurance covered medical costs of low income people, but only if it was approved. Funding came from individual premiums, from the state, and some from other private insurance funds. Geraets-Smits and Peerbooms had paid up front in Germany and Austria. Dutch law said authorisation had required that (1) treatment had to be regarded as ‘normal in the professional circles concerned’, and (2) ‘necessary’ so that adequate care could not be provided without undue delay by a care provider in the home state. The prior <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> was challenged as being contrary to TFEU article 56. Governments submitted that hospital services were not an economic activity if it was provided free of charge under a sickness insurance scheme.|$|E

Section 24 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Constitution) places a duty on government to, amongst others adopt legislative measures to protect the environment, prevent pollution and degradation, and secure sustainable development, while promoting justifiable economic and social development. Government responded {{with the introduction of}} new acts or the amendment of existing acts most of which require an authorisation process as a “command and control” tool to enforce environmental governance within the mining sector.

The research aims to attempt to align the authorisation process pertaining to mining. The mining life cycle will be illustrated and the <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirements</b> for each of the mining life cycle processes will be discussed alongside its challenges such as fragmentation, lack of capacity in government sectors, lack of communication and cooperative governance within government.

30|$|The {{extended}} <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> {{constitutes a}} ban {{and at the}} same time puts economic operators in a position to apply for authorisation (preventive ban with permit reservation). In terms of world trade law, the prohibition and the lifting of the ban as a result of the authorisation decision constitute one single measure [16]. Accordingly, this measure is subject to the assessment of conformity with WTO rules. The measure is a non-tariff trade barrier with regard to the international trade of goods. As the extended <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> features all characteristics of a technical regulation set out in No. 1 of Annex 1 to the agreement on technical barriers to trade (TBT) the scheme is subject to the legal assessment criteria provided in TBT [15].|$|E
30|$|REACH {{introduced}} {{the first time}} an <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> for common chemicals into the chemicals legislation of the EU. Authorisation is intended as an instrument to appropriately control the risks arising from manufacturing and use of SVHC. The properties defining a SVHC are described in Art. 57.|$|E
30|$|The {{technical}} regulation {{of an extended}} <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> would violate Art.  2.1 TBT, if (1) the products imported from third countries are ‘like’ products from the EEA or products imported from other third countries, and, additionally, if (2) the products imported from third countries enjoy less favourable treatment than ‘like’ domestic products or other imported products.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, the {{extended}} <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement’s</b> legitimate objective {{has to be}} taken into account [16, 21] which is to ensure a high level of protection for human health and the environment by reducing the risks of SVHC. The SVHC criteria are an expression of this level of protection, the adoption of which—according to an evolutionary interpretation of Art.  2.2 TBT in the light of the requirements of the precautionary principle—is covered by the regulatory autonomy of the Member States of the Agreement. A non-fulfilment of the normative goals would, therefore, cause unacceptable risks, irrespective of the specific SVHC category. This again underscores the necessity of the scheme [15].|$|R

30|$|As {{a result}} the {{extended}} <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> is compatible with Art. 2.1 TBT. Even in individual cases where articles with or without SVHC {{might be seen as}} ‘like’ products there is no disadvantageous treatment of imported articles compared to the domestic ones. 2 Next, the scheme is to be tested whether it constitutes an unnecessary obstacle to international trade under Art.  2.2 TBT.|$|E
30|$|To {{overcome}} this regulatory gap which, {{given the high}} numbers of imported articles, affects most consumers in the EEA one possible option would be to adjust the regulation text by expressly extending the <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> to SVHC in imported articles. For this purpose Art. 56 REACH could be modified {{to the extent that}} paragraph 1 also covers the import of an Annex XIV-substance when incorporated into articles, e.g. in a certain concentration (hereinafter: extended <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> or scheme). However, such an enhanced authorisation scheme affects aspects of international trade in goods and, as it happens, the legal omission de lege lata is no accidental slip but reflects that until the final adoption of REACH the provisions relating to articles were highly controversial—not least in view of the already then virulent debate on the WTO-compatibility [14]. Based on the findings of a legal appraisal on behalf of the UBA [15] the following sections assess whether such option would be in accordance with the legal specifications of the WTO.|$|E
30|$|The {{technical}} regulation {{of an extended}} authorisation scheme aims to prevent the risks posed by SVHC in imported articles. For all SVHC ‘scientific evidence of probable serious effects to human health or the environment’ 6 is available and every authorisation process includes, among other aspects such as socio-economic considerations, a comprehensive risk assessment. The {{technical regulation}} restricts international trade by imposing an <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> for SVHC listed in Annex XIV REACH and {{that are used in}} imported articles. However, article producers may lift the ban by proving that the risks posed by the substance use are adequately controlled or that the socio-economic benefits outweigh the risks. This instrumental design attenuates the measure’s intrusiveness. Moreover, the technical regulation is likely to make a significant contribution to its purposes while these purposes are legitimate objectives under Article 2.2 TBT. As no equally effective alternative means are available, the overall view of these facts leads {{to the conclusion that the}} extended <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> is not more trade-restrictive than necessary in terms of Article  2.2 TBT.|$|E
40|$|After {{more than}} a decade of indecision, the EU is finally now set to {{implement}} a consistent regulatory architecture for clearing and settlement. Following the agreement on a European market infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), the European Commission has proposed harmonised rules for centralised settlement depositaries (CSDs), while the European Central Bank is moving forward with its plans for a central eurozone settlement engine. This paper analyses three components of the new post-trade infrastructure measures: 1) the regulatory framework for and supervision of central counterparties under the new EMIR legislation, 2) the <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirements</b> of trade repositories and 3) the draft CSD Regulation and the progress with the ECB’s Target 2 Securities project. It then discusses the impact of the new rules, and argues that, analogous to the unexpected impact of MiFID on trading infrastructures, a similar EMIR revolution may be on its way...|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} {{previous}} exploitation, less developed countries, understandably, are suspicious of any effort that weakens {{in the name}} of scientific progress the highly-valued notions of individual autonomy and informed consent.

30|$|To {{the extent}} that {{products}} can be deemed alike, the Art.  2.1 TBT test next asks whether the extended authorisation scheme discriminates imported articles because it de jure or de facto treats them less favourably than like domestic articles or like imported articles of other origin [18, 20]. An extended <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> would by design and structure treat imported articles the same as domestic articles. Thus, {{there would be no}} de jure discrimination of imported SVHC-articles vis-à-vis domestic SVHC-free articles.|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} the REACH Regulation is to ensure {{a high level of}} {{protection}} of {{human health and the environment}} as well as the free circulation of substances on the internal market while enhancing competitiveness and innovation. To this end, REACH introduces, among other instruments, the authorisation regime for substances of very high concern (SVHC) that are listed on Annex XIV of the regulation. After expiration of the transitional period for each Annex XIV-SVHC, articles, such as most products of daily use, produced in the European Economic Area (EEA) may not contain such substances unless an authorisation was granted for the specific use or this use falls within the scope of an exemption from the <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement.</b> The authorisation scheme does, however, only apply to SVHC used in the EEA. As a consequence, REACH does not regulate SVHC entering the European market as part of imported articles which burden human health and the environment. Moreover, from an economic perspective, domestic articles are subject to stricter requirements than those which are produced abroad, putting actors from within the EEA at competitive disadvantage and thus impeding the intention of REACH to enhance competitiveness and innovation. One option to close this regulatory gap could be to extend the <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> to SVHC present in imported articles. A legal appraisal on behalf of the German Environment Agency (UBA) assesses whether such option would be in accordance with the specifications of WTO world trade law. It concludes that, measured by the standards of the WTO dispute settlement practice, such an extended authorisation scheme would neither violate the principles of national treatment and most-favoured nation treatment. Also, such regulation would not constitute an unnecessary obstacle to trade, since the extended <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> would pursue a legitimate objective covered by the regulatory autonomy of the EU and, furthermore, the regulation would not be more trade-restrictive than necessary. The contribution at hand summarises the main findings while taking into account first reactions to the legal appraisal.|$|E
30|$|The central {{requirements}} of the TBT Agreement for binding technical regulations result in particular from Art. 2.1 {{with respect to the}} national treatment and most-favoured nation treatment and from Art. 2.2 TBT concerning the prohibition of unnecessary trade restrictions [17]. Accordingly, the legal examination of the extended <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> focuses mainly on the legal criteria set out in Art. 2.1 and 2.2 TBT. These formulate independent requirements. It follows that, {{as in the case of}} a violation of Art. 2.1, due to the discriminatory effect of a technical regulation, this can be justified in overall terms by virtue of Art.  2.2.|$|E

On 19 May 2010 the United Kingdom presented a note verbale rejecting the Argentine government’s decrees and stipulating that the UK considered the decrees “are not compliant with International Law including the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea ”, and {{with respect to the}} Straits of Magellan the note recalls that “the rights of international shipping to navigate these waters expeditiously and without obstacle are affirmed in the 1984 Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Chile and Argentina with respect to the Straits of Magellan”.|$|R
30|$|The {{substance}} evaluation (SEv) process involves an in depth {{analysis of a}} carefully selected set of substances (e.g. missing information about substance properties reflecting risks or exposure-related information) and highlight {{where there is a}} need for further risk management or regulation. These data gaps can be addressed by ECHA's decision on additional requirements on the registrant. In those cases where the SEv process identifies a need for further regulation, <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirements</b> or restrictions might be initiated. Only a few substances have been taken through the SEv process to date, and so the value of this new instrument will only become clear in future. The first results of the evaluation processes show that some exposure scenarios and RMM from the first registrations may be very schematic, incomplete, inadequate, and/or overprotective and may not respect the hierarchy of RMM. The SEv is a promising instrument to identify work-related risks and to decide if further regulation is needed.|$|R
40|$|This short essay {{examines}} {{the sharing of}} bad practices in the legal regulation {{of the right to}} freedom of peaceful assembly in ‘hybrid regimes’ in the former Soviet Union. Whilst noting persistent concerns about the excessive use of force by law enforcement officials, and repeated failures to adequately protect assembly participants from violent counter-demonstrators, the essay focuses instead on three recurring characteristics of the legal framework: excessive discretion conferred on regulatory authorities (powers); notification requirements that are tantamount to <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirements</b> (procedures); and the imposition of disproportionate sanctions for relatively minor infractions of the law (penalties). Although there are clearly regional exceptions, the essay argues that there has broadly been a failure to embed the principle of proportionality in the legal framework governing the right to freedom of peaceful assembly (especially in relation to these powers, procedures and penalties). It is suggested that this failure is underpinned by a regulatory mind-set focused primarily on the management and control of assemblies, rather than their facilitation...|$|R
30|$|The {{extended}} <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> prevents SVHC {{from entering}} the EEA market as part of imported articles except where this is justified. The regulation reduces thus the exposure of {{human health and the}} environment to ‘very high concern’ substances. At the same time REACH enforcement in 18 EEA countries shows very low numbers regarding non-compliance in reference to the authorisation regime de lege lata (three cases of non-compliances in 421 inspections) [25]. The extended scheme is, therefore, ‘as written and applied’ [20, 21] appropriate to fulfil its legitimate objective [15]; provided that resources of enforcement agencies will be adjusted with a view to the new task area of controlling imported articles.|$|E
30|$|In summary, the {{regulatory}} option {{of an extended}} <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> would not violate the principles of national treatment and most-favoured nation treatment according to Art. 2.1 TBT, nor would it constitute an unnecessary trade restriction {{within the meaning of}} Article  2.2 TBT. These results are also consistent with the key objectives of the WTO, which foresee free international commodity trading contributing to the improvement of living standards and quality of life and the protection of the environment [43]. At the same time, the analysis shows that the option of an extended authorisation regime could become meaningful with regard to the next comprehensive review of the REACH Regulation.|$|E
30|$|Art. 2.2 TBT bars {{technical}} regulations {{that are more}} trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective. Since the extended <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> is trade-restrictive (non-tariff barrier) {{the question is whether}} the regulation is also more trade-restrictive than necessary (necessity test). This includes an examination of (1) whether the regulation pursues a legitimate objective, (2) whether it is appropriate to fulfil such objective and (3) whether it is more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil the objective, taking account of the risks non-fulfilment would create. Additionally, the necessity test also includes (4) a comparison with possible alternative measures. A relational analysis of all four aspects and the regulation’s actual intrusiveness allows determining whether the extended authorisation scheme is more trade-restrictive than necessary in terms of Art. 2.2 TBT [21].|$|E
30|$|Conventional risk {{assessments}} for individual PPPs, {{as they have}} been established under the old Directive 91 / 414 /EEC, aim to ensure that regulatory acceptable exposure levels are not exceeded, but they do not provide incentives for reducing risks any further. This is changed by the complementary instrument of comparative risk assessment which supports a process of continuous improvement by identifying those PPPs that allow to achieve a desired purpose with minimal risks at a given point in time. This is particularly favourable for environmental risks, where the <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirements</b> still allow to tolerate temporary adverse effects as acceptable. Moreover, acceptable exposure levels for many pesticides on the market are only achievable by applying risk mitigation measures, such as protective equipment for workers or buffer zones between sprayed agricultural land and surface waters. Such measures may fail accidentally or may be disregarded negligently. Substitution of such products by alternatives that require less risk mitigation measures is therefore desirable and shall be supported by the new instrument of comparative assessments.|$|R
