500|$|Both Willie Pless and Alondra Johnson, {{two of the}} BC Lions' {{starting}} linebackers in 1990, did {{not return}} to the team in 1991. The BC Lions signed Allen in May 1991 to compete for one of these spots. Despite suffering a bruised knee during the preseason, Allen succeeded in making the active roster. He struggled in July and August, with Lions head coach Bob O'Billovich saying [...] "he's been a step or two away <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> pass coverage". In late August, the Lions moved Allen to the practice squad and replaced him with new signing Bruce Holmes, who had led the CFL in tackles the previous season with the Ottawa Rough Riders. Allen finished his rookie season with 31 tackles, two sacks, and a fumble recovery over six games played.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{ended their}} {{contract}} with Victory Records, Thursday signed {{to the major}} label Island Records. After an entire writing and recording process that took only six months, the band issued their third album and major label debut, War <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>Time,</b> <b>on</b> September 16, 2003 to critical acclaim and strong commercial performance. War All the Time was the first release to feature Andrew Everding on keyboards, though he would not become an official member of the band until December [...] 2004, when he was officially welcomed into the band at a Christmas holiday show held at the Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, New Jersey. The album's title, coupled with it being released approximately {{two years after the}} terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, led many critics to believe it was a political album; however, Rickly has denied this on many accounts, instead claiming that he is speaking about love being a war. The album spawned two singles: [...] "Signals Over the Air" [...] and [...] "War All the Time", though the latter received considerably less attention due to MTV banning the video for controversial material involving a fake news feed that appeared to be real and teenagers being weapon targets.|$|E

[...] A second poster was also released, which again featured Riseborough and D'Arcy as Wallis and Edward, about to kiss on a beach. Written on the top left of the poster is the following line: [...] "One of the greatest love stories of all time, the king who gave up his throne for the woman he loved." [...] Throughout January 2012, Madonna appeared on two different television shows and talked about the film. She first appeared on the ABC show called Nightline, where she chatted with the host Cynthia McFadden about W.E. Then she appeared on The Graham Norton Show in the United Kingdom, where she was accompanied by D'Arcy and Riseborough. The UK and US premiere for the film took place on January 11 and 23, 2012, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|The Banzai Institute exteriors {{were shot}} in Rustic Canyon, Los Angeles, with the {{interiors}} filmed in an Art Deco house designed in 1931 by MGM art director Cedric Gibbons for his wife, Dolores del Río. Deserted rooms at Brentwood's V.A. hospital {{were used for}} Dr. Lizardo's room at the Trenton Home for the Criminally Insane. Lizardo's 1938 laboratory was filmed at a deserted industrial site, Alpha Tubing. The set decorators rented a collection of 1930s electrical props originally used in the original Boris Karloff Frankenstein films. The interiors of Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems were shot in the abandoned Firestone tire factory. The production rented warhead nosecones from Modern Props and had televisions going <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>on</b> the set. Wilmington's Department of Water and Power provided the location for Dr. Lizardo's shock tower and served as the Yoyodyne exterior. Weller remembers that during the scene where his character is tortured by Dr. Lizardo, [...] "I never laughed so hard in my life! They had to stop takes over and over on that segment because I was laughing at the banter between [...] Lloyd and [...] Lithgow." [...] The Armco Steel Plant in Torrance housed the Lectroid launch hangar. Finally, 12 weeks of filming were done on the backlot and soundstages at MGM. The film's closing scene, in which the characters join each other to walk as the credits play, was shot at the Sepulveda Dam, adjacent to the concrete LA River bed.|$|E

40|$|The {{flexibility}} coefficient is popularly used {{to implement the}} macroevaluation of shape, safety, and economy for arch dam. However, the description of {{flexibility coefficient}} has not drawn a widely consensus <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> Based <b>on</b> {{a large number of}} relative instance data, the relationship between influencing factor and flexibility coefficient is analyzed by means of partial least-squares regression. The partial least-squares regression equation of flexibility coefficient in certain height range between 30 [*]m and 70 [*]m is established. Regressive precision and equation stability are further investigated. The analytical model of statistical flexibility coefficient is provided. The flexibility coefficient criterion is determined preliminarily to evaluate the shape of low- and medium-sized arch dam. A case study is finally presented to illustrate the potential engineering application. According to the analysis result of partial least-squares regression, it is shown that there is strong relationship between flexibility coefficient and average thickness of dam, thickness-height ratio of crown cantilever, arc height ratio, and dam height, but the effect of rise-span ratio is little relatively. The considered factors in the proposed model are more comprehensive, and the applied scope is clearer than that of the traditional calculation methods. It is more suitable for the analogy analysis in engineering design and the safety evaluation for arch dam...|$|R
