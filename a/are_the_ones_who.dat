The Paramahamsas do not carry {{articles}} or show signs that suggest they have renounced, their conduct is concealed, they may only seem insane. They do not carry staves, nor bowl, nor hair tuft, nor sacred thread, but they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> seek after the Atman (self, soul).|$|E

He <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> understands that his soul is without a second, is devoid of class, is devoid of actions, is devoid of faults.

5|$|PTV {{becomes a}} huge success, and Brian and Stewie, {{impressed}} by the hits, join in to help Peter expand his television programming, as well as performing their own show Cheeky Bastard sitcom on PTV. Lois is furious about everyone's lust for perverted TV, as she is concerned {{over the issue of}} how children will be influenced by his programming (in the episode's DVD release, Peter and Cleveland, in a parody of Jackass, defecate on top of Lois' car). Brian then tells Lois that parents and legal guardians <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> should take full responsibility for what kids watch on TV and also points out that there are much worse influences besides TV. Regardless of that, Lois calls the FCC to have PTV shut down. This prompts Peter, Brian, and Stewie to perform an elaborate musical number about how insane the FCC's regulations are. Despite being impressed with the song, the arriving FCC representatives shut down PTV. When Peter tells the FCC representatives that while they can censor television they can't stop people from being who they are or how they live their lives, they decide to take on the challenge.|$|E
5|$|Since the Balfour Declaration of 1926 and the Statute of Westminster 1931, all the Commonwealth realms {{have been}} {{sovereign}} kingdoms, the monarch and governors-general acting {{solely on the}} advice of the local ministers, who generally maintain the support of the legislature and <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> secure the passage of bills. They therefore are unlikely to advise the sovereign, or his or her representative, to withhold assent. The power to withhold the royal assent was exercised by Alberta's lieutenant governor, John C. Bowen, in 1937, in respect of three bills passed in the legislature dominated by William Aberhart's Social Credit party. Two bills sought to put banks under the authority of the province, thereby interfering with the federal government's powers. The third, the Accurate News and Information Bill, purported to force newspapers to print government rebuttals to stories to which the provincial cabinet objected. The unconstitutionality of all three bills was later confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a common}} sense of {{confusion}} between the difference of PTSD and a normal response to trauma.

They may develop small flashbacks, have bad dreams, or feel like they can't get the traumatic experience out of their mind, however, depending on the athlete’s mental ability, or how determined they are within their chosen sport, these symptoms can be lifted in time. Along with this, those athletes who are weaker mentally <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> tend to not be able to recover themselves and fall into the category of PTSD.|$|E

On the other hand, Dargis commented that Army of Shadowss [...] "lack of pity" [...] makes it [...] "so unbearably sad, its almost repellent hardness of heart.

500|$|Scholars {{have noted}} that the Klingons, not humans, <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> quote Shakespeare; Gorkon claims {{at one point in}} the film that [...] "You have not {{experienced}} Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon." [...] Translating Shakespeare into Klingon proved problematic because Marc Okrand had not created a verb for [...] "to be" [...] when he developed the language. Shakespeare scholar Paul A. Cantor argues that this association is appropriate—the warlike Klingons find their literary matches in the characters Othello, Mark Antony, and Macbeth—but that it also reinforces a claim that the end of the Cold War means the end of heroic literature such as Shakespeare's. Meyer said the idea for having the Klingons claim Shakespeare as their own was based on Nazi Germany's attempt to claim the Bard as German before World War II. According to Kay Smith, the use of Shakespeare has meaning in itself and also derives new meaning (underscoring cultural politics in the film) by its rearticulation in a new form.|$|E
500|$|After vanquishing eight {{powerful}} robots under {{allegiance to}} King (Cold Man, Astro Man, Ground Man, Magic Man, Tengu Man, Dynamo Man, Pirate Man, and Burner Man), the duo infiltrates his castle and engages him in combat.

Putting all of his remaining energy into a blast, Proto Man manages to destroy King's shield and loses consciousness, allowing Mega Man and Bass to best King in battle afterwards. King questions why they fight so hard for humans when robots are the superior species. The pair explains that humans <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> created robots in the first place, which confuses King.

When King asks the evil inventor why robots fight {{each other for the}} sake of humans, Wily strengthens his [...] "brainwashing level" [...] and restores his power. Mega Man and Bass engage King in another battle and defeat him, but not before the latter teleports Proto Man out of his castle.
