40|$|We {{introduce}} <b>a</b> contrarian <b>opinion</b> (CO) {{model in}} which a fraction p of contrarians within a group holds <b>a</b> strong <b>opinion</b> opposite to the opinion held {{by the rest of}} the group. At the initial stage, stable clusters of two <b>opinions,</b> <b>A</b> and B exist. Then we introduce contrarians which hold <b>a</b> strong B <b>opinion</b> into the <b>opinion</b> <b>A</b> group. Through their interactions, the contrarians are able to decrease the size of the largest <b>A</b> <b>opinion</b> cluster, and even destroy it. We see this kind of method in operation, e. g when companies send free new products to potential customers in order to convince them to adopt the product and influence others. We study the CO model, using two different strategies, on both ER and scale-free networks. In strategy I, the contrarians are positioned at random. In strategy II, the contrarians are chosen to be the highest degrees nodes. We find that for both strategies the size of the largest A cluster decreases to zero as p increases as in a phase transition. At a critical threshold value p_c the system undergoes a second-order phase transition that belongs to the same universality class of mean field percolation. We find that even for an ER type model, where the degrees of the nodes are not so distinct, strategy II is significantly more effctive in reducing the size of the largest <b>A</b> <b>opinion</b> cluster and, at very small values of p, the largest <b>A</b> <b>opinion</b> cluster is destroyed...|$|R

5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{with regard}} to punitive psychiatry, the nature of psychiatry is of such a sort that using psychiatrists against opponents of authorities is always tempting for the authorities, because it is seemingly possible not {{to take into account}} <b>an</b> <b>opinion</b> by the person who received a diagnosis. Therefore, the issue will always remain relevant. While we do not have government policy of using psychiatry for repression, psychiatrists and former psychiatric nomenklatura retained the same on-the-spot reflexes.|$|E
