40|$|The diet of the South American Tern (Sterna hirundinacea) and its {{seasonal}} variation during the 2005 and 2006 non-reproductive {{seasons in the}} Uruguayan Atlantic coast was analyzed. Diet was assessed by the analysis of pellets collected in the Rocha lagoon sandbar, a major tern roosting area in Uruguay, aiming to analyze the hypothesis that terns feed mainly on the <b>Argentine</b> <b>Anchovy</b> (Engraulis anchoita) during the wintering period. A total of 844 pellets were collected, 442 in 2005 and 402 in 2006. Diet was composed of fish (88 %), insects (9 %) and crustaceans (3 %). The main fish species consumed was the <b>Argentine</b> <b>Anchovy</b> (77. 7 %), followed by Marini's Anchovy (Anchoa marinii) (7. 9 %) and the Striped Weakfish (Cynoscion guatucupa) (3. 6 %). Insects and crustaceans were the main items {{in two of the}} groups of pellets collected during the study period. Despite this temporal variation in the diet, the <b>Argentine</b> <b>Anchovy</b> was the main prey item consumed during both seasons. These results support the hypothesis that South American Terns strongly depend on anchovies as trophic resource. En este trabajo se analizó la dieta del Gaviotín Sudamericano (Sterna hirundinacea) y su variación estacional durante las temporadas no reproductivas de 2005 y 2006 en la costa atlántica uruguaya. La dieta fue estudiada por medio del análisis de bolos colectados en la barra de la laguna de Rocha, una importante zona de descanso para la especie en Uruguay, con el propósito de analizar la hipótesis de que el gaviotín se alimenta principalmente de Anchoíta Argentina (Engraulis anchoita) durante el período de invernada. Un total de 844 bolos fueron colectados, 442 en 2005 y 402 en 2006. La dieta estuvo compuesta por peces (88 %), insectos (9 %) y crustáceos (3 %). La principal presa consumida fue la Anchoíta Argentina (77. 7 %), seguida de la Anchoa (Anchoa marinii) (7. 9 %) y la Pescadilla de Red (Cynoscion guatucupa) (3. 6 %). Los insectos y los crustáceos fueron el ítem principal en dos de las muestras (grupos de bolos) colectadas durante el período de estudio. A pesar de esta variación temporal en la dieta la Anchoíta Argentina fue la presa principal durante las dos temporadas de estudio. Este resultado apoya la hipótesis planteada de que la anchoíta es el principal recurso alimenticio del Gaviotín Sudamericano...|$|E
2500|$|South American {{sea lions}} consume {{numerous}} species of fishes, including <b>Argentine</b> hake and <b>anchovies.</b> [...] They also eat cephalopods, such as shortfin squid, Patagonian squid, and octopus. [...] They {{have even been}} observed preying on penguins, pelicans, and young South American fur seals. South American sea lions may forage at the ocean floor for slow-moving prey or hunt schooling prey in groups, depending on the area. When captured, the prey is shaken violently and torn apart. South American sea lions have been recorded {{to take advantage of}} the hunting efforts of dusky dolphins, feeding on the fish they herd together. The sea lions themselves are preyed on by killer whales and sharks, and visited as a handy source of blood by common vampire bats from Isla Pan de Azúcar.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAnchovies {{have been}} {{traditionally}} captured and processed {{for human consumption}} for millennia. In the case of Spain, ripened and salted anchovies are a delicacy, which, in some cases, can reach high commercial values. Although {{there have been a}} number of studies presenting DNA methodologies for the identification of anchovies, this is one of the first studies investigating the level of mislabelling in this kind of products in Europe. Sixty-three commercial semipreserved anchovy products were collected in different types of food markets in four Spanish cities to check labelling accuracy. Species determination in these commercial products was performed by sequencing two different cyt-b mitochondrial DNA fragments. Results revealed mislabelling levels higher than 15 %, what authors consider relatively high considering the importance of the product. The most frequent substitute species was the <b>Argentine</b> <b>anchovy,</b> Engraulis anchoita, which can be interpreted as an economic fraud...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the influence of thermal treatment (74, 82, and 90 °C), glycerol (30 %, 35 %, and 40 %, w/w) and protein concentrations (3. 0 %, 3. 5 %, and 4. 0 % w/w) of film-forming solution on the properties of <b>Argentine</b> <b>anchovy</b> (Engraulis anchoita) protein isolate (API) films produced by casting. The API presented 88. 8 % of proteins, 5. 5 % moisture, 1. 3 % lipids, 1. 0 % ash and 53. 3 % of polar amino acids. The DSC of protein isolate was observed at maximum temperature of 62. 2 °C and ΔH 6. 4 J/g. The thickness, water vapor permeability, color difference and opacity of the films were not affected by the experimental variables studied (p> 0. 05). The lowest solubility, elongation, and highest tensile strength of the films occurred at low temperature, low protein and glycerol concentrations (p< 0. 05). Micrographs obtained by scanning electron microscopy of the films showed homogeneous surfaces at low temperature...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Argentine</b> <b>anchovy</b> (Engraulis anchoita) is an {{essential}} species in the pelagic ecosystem of the southwest Atlantic Ocean, and a potentially important fishery resource. Exploitation has recently started in southern Brazil, so it requires {{a better understanding of}} their structure and population dynamics. This work aims to update the information on the population identification of E. anchoita. Parameters such as age and size composition, length-at-age data and other parameters using sagittae otoliths were used to compare anchovy of the continental shelf between 20 ° and 32 °S. The results indicate the existence of different populations in the southeastern and southern regions of Brazil: the bonaerense stock in southern Brazil is shared with Argentina and Uruguay and exhibits migratory behavior, while in the southeast there is a population confined to this region and shows different population characteristics. This has implications for the management of this species and should be taken into account by the institutions responsible for the assessment and management of fisheries in Brazil...|$|E
40|$|We {{implement}} a simple hydrodynamical model to study behavioural swimming tilt angle of open swimmbladder fish. For this purpose we study {{the stability of}} forces acting on a fish swimming horizontally with constant velocity. Additionally, the open swimbladder compression with the depth is modelled by Boyle's law. With these, our model gives an analytical solution relating the depth with the body tilt angle and the velocity. An interesting result for steady horizontal swimming is that the body tilt decreases with velocity almost like v^- 1. Moreover, we give an expression for the maximum tilt angle. Then, by introducing the assumption of constant swimming power we relate the swimming velocity with the tilting. Furthermore, we show that the hydrodynamical influence of a temperature gradient produced by a thermocline seems to be negligible for the fish tilting. These results are considerably helpful for more realistic modelling of the acoustic target strength of fish. Finally, we tested our results by comparing the hydrodynamics solutions with others obtained from acoustic observations and simulations of target strength for <b>Argentine</b> <b>anchovy.</b> Comment: 23 pages, 10 figure...|$|E
40|$|It is {{difficult}} to address all of the direct environmental impacts of fisheries using conventional methods of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). A methodological framework was developed that calculates regionalised characterisation factors for biomass uptake by fishing activities to assess impacts of biotic-resource depletion at both species and ecosystem levels. These two levels were studied to include effects of catch on {{the collapse of a}} particular stock of a given species and on total biomass availability in oceans. Characterisation factors were calculated for 127 fish species and 88 marine provinces. The compatibility of this method with other frameworks is discussed, as well as the methodological limitations. The method was applied to two contrasting examples from fisheries (Northern Atlantic albacore tuna and Northern <b>Argentine</b> <b>anchovy).</b> The impacts of one tonne of tuna on biotic natural resources were 4 and 14 times as high as those of anchovy at the ecosystem and species levels, respectively. The application demonstrates that the method is relevant, as it addresses a topic of global interest and fills a gap in LCA impact assessment to contrast impacts of removals of different fish species in terms of biotic natural resource depletion...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the stock biomasses of <b>Argentine</b> <b>anchovy,</b> survey by a regular echo sounder and operation of a mid-water trawl were made. This study was conducted by R/V Shinkai-Maru in the spring (1 st cruise) and summer (2 nd cruise) seasons of 1978. The survey areas were about 10 × 10 ⁴ mile² shallower than 100 m on the continental shelf off Argentina, and were divided into about 100 small blocks. Echo-sounding lines were set on the diagonal lines of the blocks. The total distances covered were about 5 × 10 ³ miles. Counting of echoes by sounder {{and the results of}} catches obtained by simultaneous fishing operations were combined and analyzed for estimation. The stock biomass index and the density index in each block, and the density of anchovy for each operation were calculated. Using these values, the stock biomasses of anchovy were estimated by two methods. In the 1 st cruise, the estimates were 368. 4 × 10 ⁴ tons by equation (4) and 445. 2 × 10 ⁴ tons by eqution (5), and the 2 nd cruise, 984. 4 × 10 ⁴ tons and 797. 7 × 10 ⁴ tons. ﻿アルゼンチン共和国と海洋水産資源開発センターが締結した「漁業調査実行取極め」の一環として, 1978 年 9 月 21 日～ 10 月 12 日(第 1 次航海) と 11 月 20 日～ 12 月 19 日(第 2 次) に深海丸によって実施した. 用いた魚探は海上電機のMWB- 115 型(周波数 24 KHz,指向角前後 3 °左右 6 °,湿式) である. 対象水域は両航海とも陸棚上の 35 ° 30 '～ 47 °S, 54 °～ 67 ° 30 'Wの主として 100 m以浅で,面積は約 10 万mile 2 である. 対象水域を沿岸側は 30 '× 30 'の小格子に,沖合側は 1 °× 1 °の大格子にわけ,通常は格子の対角線上を航走するように調査線を設定した. 魚種判定と資源量推定のため調査線上で中層曳トロール網操業を 72 回と 90 回実施した. 調査は昼夜兼行で, 1 航程は約 5 千mileであった. 平均 13 ノットで航走中の魚探の全記録像のうち,カタクチイワシと思われるものについてそれぞれ面積を計測した. 昼夜の集群生態の差を少なくするため,記録像ごとに 4 段階の濃度による重みづけを行い,魚群量指数(SBI) を求めた. 一つの格子ごとに走査 10 mileあたりのSBIを計算し,魚群量密度の相対分布指数とした(魚群量密度指数DI). カタクチイワシ魚群の密度(D) を漁獲量・曳網速度(時間) ・網口面積より操業ごとに計算した. 〔A法〕操業が円滑にいき,魚群の幅が実際の曳網距離以上であったいくつかの操業を選び出し,操業試験から求めたDと曳網した記録像から求めたDIとの平均比を算出した. この比と全格子の平均DIおよび分布可能な全体積をかけあわせた. 〔B法〕実際の漁獲量と,曳網距離内にあり入網したと推測されるSBIとの比を求め,この比に全格子の平均DIと対象水域の全面積をかけあわせたものを走査 10 mileの魚探入力有効面積で除した. 1 次航海はA法 368. 4 × 104,B法 445. 2 × 104 トン, 2 次航海はA法 984. 4 × 104,B法 797. 7 × 104 トンという推定値が得られた...|$|E
40|$|Os filmes são produzidos a partir de macromoléculas, que podem ser utilizados como embalagem, como os polissacarídeos, lipídeos e proteínas. As proteínas se destacam dos demais, pois possuem uma estrutura com 20 monômeros diferentes, que confere um amplo potencial de ligações intermoleculares. A incorporação de agentes ativos em filmes é uma alternativa como embalagem, para inibir ou retardar a multiplicação de microrganismos patógenos e deteriorantes em alimentos. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a atividade antimicrobiana de filmes à base de isolado protéico de {{anchoita}} (Engraulis anchoita) – IPA adicionados de ácidos orgânicos. Para tanto, foi elaborado o IPA, pela solubilização alcalina da proteína e precipitação no ponto isoelétrico a partir de carne mecanicamente separada. O IPA foi avaliado quanto a sua composição proximal, aminoacídica e por DSC. A solução formadora dos filmes foi elaborada a partir de IPA, água, glicerol e hidróxido de sódio. As formulações dos filmes foram elaboradas segundo um planejamento fatorial 23. Foram avaliadas as propriedades físico-químicas de resistência a tração (RT) e elongação (E); espessura, solubilidade e permeabilidade ao vapor de água (PVA); a diferença de cor (∆E*) e opacidade (Y) e microscopia eletrônica de varredura (MEV) de filmes à base de IPA. Os filmes com diferentes concentrações de ácido sórbico (AS) ou ácido benzóico (AB) foram desenvolvidos a partir da condição cujo as propriedades físico-químicas foram as melhores, sendo comparados aos filmes controles. Estes, foram avaliados quanto a sua atividade antimicrobiana frente aos microrganismos Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus e Salmonella Enteritidis pelo método de difusão em disco, além das propriedades físico-químicas, MEV e FT-IV. Os filmes com maior atividade antimicrobiana e os filmes controle foram aplicados sobre carne bovina, inoculados com os microrganismos inibidos no método de difusão em disco e armazenados a 5 °C. Estes, foram avaliados a cada 2 dias durante 12 dias de armazenamento, pela método de contagem em gotas. O IPA apresentou 88, 8 % de proteína e 53, 3 % de aminoácidos polares e temperatura de desnaturação de 62, 2 °C. A espessura, PVA, ∆E* e Y dos filmes não foram afetados pelas variáveis estudadas no experimento. A menor solubilidade e maior RT dos filmes ocorreram em baixa concentração de IPA, glicerol e tratamento térmico, mas a E aumentou com o acréscimo dessas variáveis. As MEV das superfícies dos filmes foram homogêneas, para aqueles com leve tratamento térmico. O aumento da concentração de AS e AB na faixa de 0, 50 a 1, 50 % resultou na diminuição da RT e aumento da E, solubilidade, ∆E* e Y. Houve mudança da organização molecular e interações intermoleculares entre as moléculas de IPA e AB testados pela avaliação do FT-IV. As MEV revelaram microporos em filmes com 1, 50 % de AS, o que resultou em filmes com menor homogeneidade. A maior atividade antimicrobiana foi verificada nos filmes com 1, 50 % de AS e AB frente a E. coli O 157 :H 7, L. monocytogenes e S. Enteritidis. Estes filmes foram aplicados sobre carne bovina inoculada com E. coli O 157 :H 7 e L. monocytogenes. Os filmes de AS frente a E. coli O 157 :H 7 e L. monocytogenes apresentaram uma redução de 5 e 4 log UFC. g- 1, respectivamente, em relação ao filme controle. O efeito do AB frente a estas bactérias, apresentou uma redução de 6 e 5 log UFC. g- 1, ao final do 12 ° dia de armazenamento, respectivamente. Os filmes elaborados à base de IPA, adicionados de AS ou AB podem ser eficazes contra os patógenos alimentares testados. The {{films are}} produced from macromolecules, {{which may be}} used as packaging, such as polysaccharides, lipids and proteins. The proteins stand out from the others because they have a structure with 20 different monomers, which confers broad potential for intermolecular bonds. The incorporation of active agents in films is an alternative for packaging, to inhibit or retard the multiplication of pathogens and spoilage microorganisms in foods. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the antimicrobial activity of films based on <b>Argentine</b> <b>anchovy</b> (Engraulis anchoita) - API protein isolate added organic acids. To that end we developed the API by protein alkaline solubilization and precipitation at the isoelectric point from mechanically recovered meat. The API was evaluated on their proximal and amino acid composition and by DSC. The forming solution of the films was made from API, water, glycerol and sodium hydroxide. The formulations of the films were prepared using a 23 factorial design. We evaluated the physicochemical properties of tensile strength (TS) and elongation (E), thickness, solubility and permeability to water vapor (WPV), the color difference (∆E*) and opacity (Y) and electron microscopy (SEM) of films based on API. The films with different concentrations of sorbic acid (AS) or benzoic acid (BA) were developed from the condition which the physicochemical properties were the best, being compared to films controls. These were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against microorganisms Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella Enteritidis by disk diffusion method, and the physicochemical properties, SEM and FT-IR. The films with higher antimicrobial activity and control films were applied on beef, inoculated with microorganisms inhibited the disk diffusion method and stored at 5 °C. These were evaluated every 2 days during 12 days storage, by drops counting method. API had 88. 8 % protein and 53. 3 % of polar amino acids and denaturation temperature of 62. 2 °C. The thickness, WPV, ∆E* and Y of the films were not affected by variables in the experiment. The lower solubility and higher TS of the films occurred in a low concentration of API, glycerol and heat treatment, but E increased with the addition of these variables. The SEM of the surfaces of the films were homogeneous, for those with mild heat treatment. Increasing the concentration of AS and BA in the range 0. 50 to 1. 50 % resulted in a decrease in TS and increased E, Y and ∆E*. There was a change of the molecular organization and intermolecular interactions between the molecules of API and BA tested by FT-IR evaluation. The SEM revealed micropores in films with 1. 50 % of SA, which resulted in films with less homogeneity. The greatest antimicrobial activity was observed for films with 1. 50 % of SA and BA against E. coli O 157 :H 7, L. monocytogenes and S. Enteritidis. These films were applied on beef inoculated with E. coli O 157 :H 7 and L. monocytogenes. The SA films against E. coli O 157 :H 7 and L. monocytogenes show a reduction of 5 and 4 log CFU. g- 1, respectively, in relation to the control film. The effect of AB against these bacteria showed a reduction of 6 and 5 log CFU. g- 1 at the end of the 12 th day of storage, respectively. The films based on API added SA or BA can be effective against foodborne pathogens tested...|$|E
