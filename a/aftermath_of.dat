40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 65 - 68). This paper {{explores the}} {{varying degrees of}} trauma, and its aftermath, within literature in the British modern period. Utilizing the works of Katherine Mansfield, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, and D. H. Lawrence, I argue that the British modernist techniques, unique to that period, mirror the psychological <b>aftermaths</b> <b>of</b> trauma. Despite the inclusion <b>of</b> the <b>aftermaths</b> <b>of</b> trauma within these texts, the authors are unable to successfully communicate the point of trauma within their works, which indicates an inability to recognize or cope with the trauma itself...|$|R

5|$|According to Plutarch, one {{tradition}} had it {{that the}} Persian king (who at the time would still have been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating peace treaty in the <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> the Eurymedon. However, as Plutarch admits, other authors denied that such a peace was made at this time, and the more logical date for any peace treaty would have been after the Cyprus campaign of 450 BC. The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king acted {{as if he had}} made a humiliating peace with the Greeks, because he was so fearful of engaging in battle with them again. It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a peace treaty was made in the <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> Eurymedon.|$|E
