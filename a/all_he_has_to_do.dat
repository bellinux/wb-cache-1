I only want him to call me father temporarily so that I can faithfully transmit all the skills I have learned {{in my life to}} a single person.

500|$|Talks {{about the}} 2014 NBA draft began awkwardly when Paul Stauskas told Sports Illustrated about his son, Nik: [...] "He knows <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is keep his {{nose to the}} {{grindstone}} for another couple of months, and there’s a really good possibility {{he might be able}} to go pro." [...] Several days later Stauskas tried to distance himself from his father's statement, apologizing to his fans. After the season Stauskas, Robinson and McGary said that they were considering entering the draft, but had not made a decision. Each submitted evaluation requests to the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee, which was required to respond by April 14 (giving the players until April 27 to declare their eligibility). On April 10 it was reported that Stauskas had decided to turn pro, but he denied he had made a decision. The reports were based on rumors that Stauskas had decided to hire Mark Bartelstein (father of former Michigan teammate Josh Bartelstein and agent for former teammate Tim Hardaway, Jr.) as his agent. In an April 15 joint press conference on the Big Ten Network, Robinson and Stauskas announced that they were declaring their eligibility for the NBA draft. When he learned that he had tested positive for marijuana after the Sweet Sixteen victory over Tennessee and was facing a one-year suspension, McGary also entered the draft.|$|E
500|$|Discussion {{about him}} {{entering}} the 2014 NBA draft {{began when he}} got hot in January 2014 and his father told Sports Illustrated, [...] "He knows <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is keep his nose to the grindstone for another couple of months, and there’s a really good possibility {{he might be able}} to go Pro." [...] However, a few days later, Stauskas attempted to distance himself from his father's statements and apologized to his fans. Following the season, Stauskas, who was regarded as a likely late first round selection, said he would need some time to process his decision and that he would make his decision after talking to his coaches and family. On April 6, Stauskas said he would make his decision within the next week or so. On April 7, David Aldridge rated Stauskas as the number one potential draft entrant among shooting guards (ahead of Harris, James Young, and Andrew Harrison) and a late lottery selection. Others agree that Stauskas is a likely late lottery selection. Stauskas and teammates McGary and Robinson all submitted evaluation requests to the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee which must respond by April 14, giving the players until April 27 to make themselves eligible for the draft if they so choose. On April 10, reports emerged that Stauskas had decided to go pro, but he denied he had made a decision. The reports were based on rumors that Stauskas had decided to hire Mark Bartelstein as his agent. Bartelstein is the father of former Michigan teammate Josh Bartelstein, and agent for former teammate Tim Hardaway, Jr. On April 15, in a joint press conference with Robinson on the Big Ten Network, Stauskas declared for the 2014 NBA draft. During his two years with Michigan, the school enjoyed its winningest two-year stretch in school history marked by a total of 59 wins. Of Michigan's prior 14 early NBA draft entrants, 10 were selected in the first round and 3 in the second. Stauskas did sign with Bartelstein (along with teammate McGary). On May 5, Stauskas threw out the ceremonial first pitch for the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} [...] "having the same number" [...] or [...] "having the same cardinality" [...] can be {{captured}} {{by the idea of}} one-to-one correspondence. [...] This (purely definitional) assumption is sometimes known as Hume's principle. [...] As Frege said, [...] "If a waiter wishes to be certain of laying exactly as many knives on a table as plates, he has no need to count either of them; <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is to lay immediately to the right of every plate a knife, taking care that every knife on the table lies immediately to the right of a plate. [...] Plates and knives are thus correlated one to one." [...] Sets in such a correlation are called equinumerous, and the correlation is called a one-to-one correspondence.|$|E

6000|$|He assented instantly. [...] "Quite right. Give me a crack on the ear {{every time}} I break out. I wish I were a robin. See that chap on the lawn!

If he is not satisfied with that I refer him to any work on conic sections and if not convinced even then I refer him so far that he will never come back.|$|E
