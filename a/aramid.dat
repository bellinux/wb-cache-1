25|$|In {{detail a}} {{dragline}} silk's tensile strength {{is comparable to}} that of high-grade alloy steel (450 − 2000 MPa), and about half as strong as <b>aramid</b> filaments, such as Twaron or Kevlar (3000 MPa).|$|E
25|$|Sensitive {{polymers}} include thermoplastics and speciality fibers like aramids. UV absorption {{leads to}} chain degradation {{and loss of}} strength at sensitive points in the chain structure. <b>Aramid</b> rope must be shielded with a sheath of thermoplastic {{if it is to}} retain its strength.|$|E
25|$|Gliders {{were mainly}} built {{of wood and}} metal but the {{majority}} now have composite materials using glass, carbon fibre and <b>aramid</b> fibers. To minimise drag, these types have a fuselage and long narrow wings, i.e. a high aspect ratio. Both single-seat and two-seat gliders are available.|$|E

25|$|Some {{fiber optic}} cable {{versions}} are reinforced with <b>aramid</b> yarns or glass yarns as intermediary strength member. In commercial terms, usage of the glass yarns are more cost effective while no loss in mechanical durability of the cable. Glass yarns also protect the cable core against rodents and termites.|$|E
25|$|While mostly {{chrysotile}} asbestos fibers were once used in automobile brake pads, shoes, and clutch discs, contaminants of amphiboles were present. Since approximately the mid-1990s, brake pads, new or replacement, have been manufactured instead with linings made of ceramic, carbon, metallic and <b>aramid</b> fiber (Twaron or Kevlar—the same material used in bulletproof vests).|$|E
25|$|<b>Aramid</b> fibers {{are widely}} used for {{reinforcing}} composite materials, often in combination with carbon fiber and glass fiber. The matrix for high performance composites is usually epoxy resin. Typical applications include monocoque bodies for F1 racing cars, helicopter rotor blades, tennis, table tennis, badminton and squash rackets, kayaks, cricket bats, and field hockey, ice hockey and lacrosse sticks.|$|E
25|$|The {{chopped fiber}} {{has been used}} as a {{replacement}} for asbestos in brake pads. Dust produced from asbestos brakes is toxic, while <b>aramids</b> are a benign substitute.|$|R

50|$|Sailcloth {{encompasses}} {{a wide variety}} of materials that span those from natural fibers, such as flax (linen), hemp or cotton in various forms including canvas, to synthetic fibers, including nylon, polyester, <b>aramids,</b> and carbon fibers.|$|R
25|$|Some {{police cars}} can be {{optionally}} upgraded with bullet resistant armor {{in the car}} doors. The armor is typically made from ceramic ballistic plates and <b>aramid</b> baffles. A 2016 news report said that Ford sells 5 to 10 percent of their US police vehicles with ballistic protection in the doors. In 2017 Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York City, announced that all NYPD patrol cars would be installed with bullet-resistant door panels and bullet-resistant window inserts.|$|E
25|$|Fibre-reinforced plastic/polymer (FRP) and {{glass-reinforced}} plastic (GRP) {{consist of}} fibres of polymer, glass, carbon, <b>aramid</b> or other polymers or high-strength fibres {{set in a}} resin matrix to form a rebar rod, or grid, or fibres. These rebars are installed {{in much the same}} manner as steel rebars. The cost is higher but, suitably applied, the structures have advantages, in particular a dramatic reduction in problems related to corrosion, either by intrinsic concrete alkalinity or by external corrosive fluids that might penetrate the concrete. These structures can be significantly lighter and usually have a longer service life. The cost of these materials has dropped dramatically since their widespread adoption in the aerospace industry and by the military.|$|E
25|$|In {{common with}} all {{contemporary}} Formula One designs, the FW30's basic architecture {{is built around}} a carbon fibre, <b>aramid</b> and honeycomb composite material monocoque. The design carries over the FW29's zero keel, double wishbone suspension arrangement, along with the twin-pillar rear wing. The FW30's front wing is one {{area in which the}} design of the FW29 was not followed. In place of the older car's two-element wing a three-element design was introduced, similar to that used on the 2007 McLaren MP4-22. As with the McLaren design the Williams wing's upper element features a central section that is raised up and passes over the tip of the car's, slightly lower, nose cone. However, unlike the McLaren, the FW30's front wing is suspended from the nose cone using the forward element.|$|E
25|$|Polymers show creep {{basically}} {{in two different}} ways. At typical work loads (5 up to 50%) {{ultra high molecular weight}} polyethylene (Spectra, Dyneema) will show time-linear creep, whereas polyester or <b>aramids</b> (Twaron, Kevlar) will show a time-logarithmic creep.|$|R
50|$|The hydrogen-bond {{networks}} make {{both natural}} and synthetic polymers sensitive to humidity levels in the atmosphere because water molecules can diffuse into the surface and disrupt the network. Some polymers are more sensitive than others. Thus nylons are more sensitive than <b>aramids,</b> and nylon 6 more sensitive than nylon-11.|$|R
50|$|The most {{well-known}} <b>aramids</b> (Kevlar, Twaron, Nomex, New Star and Teijinconex) are AABB polymers. Nomex, Teijinconex and New Star contain predominantly the meta-linkage and are poly-metaphenylene isophthalamides (MPIA).Kevlar and Twaron are both p-phenylene terephthalamides (PPTA), the simplest {{form of the}} AABB para-polyaramide. PPTA {{is a product of}} p-phenylene diamine (PPD) and terephthaloyl dichloride (TDC or TCl).|$|R
25|$|UHMWPE is {{polyethylene}} with {{a molecular}} weight numbering in the millions, usually between 3.5 and 7.5 million amu. The {{high molecular weight}} makes it a very tough material, but results in less efficient packing of the chains into the crystal structure as evidenced by densities of less than high-density polyethylene (for example, 0.930–0.935nbsp&g/cm3). UHMWPE can be made through any catalyst technology, although Ziegler catalysts are most common. Because of its outstanding toughness and its cut, wear, and excellent chemical resistance, UHMWPE is used in a diverse range of applications. These include can- and bottle-handling machine parts, moving parts on weaving machines, bearings, gears, artificial joints, edge protection on ice rinks, and butchers' chopping boards. It is commonly used {{for the construction of}} articular portions of implants used for hip and knee replacements. As fiber, it competes with <b>aramid</b> in bulletproof vests.|$|E
2500|$|To {{create a}} rugged, {{lightweight}} shell, Porsche adopted an aluminium and <b>Aramid</b> (Kevlar) composite for body use {{along with a}} Nomex floor, instead of the steel normally used on their production cars.

2500|$|Flexible monoplace {{chambers}} {{are available}} ranging from collapsible flexible <b>aramid</b> fiber-reinforced chambers {{which can be}} disassembled for transport via truck or SUV, with a maximum working pressure of 2 bar above ambient complete with BIBS allowing full oxygen treatment schedules. to portable, air inflated [...] "soft" [...] chambers that can operate at between [...] above atmospheric pressure with no supplemental oxygen, and longitudinal zipper closure.|$|E
50|$|In {{civilian}} life, helmets {{are used}} for recreational activities and sports (e.g. jockeys in horse racing, American football, ice hockey, cricket, baseball, camogie, hurling and rock climbing); dangerous work activities (e.g. construction, mining, riot police); and transportation (e.g. motorcycle helmets and bicycle helmets). Since the 1990s, most helmets are made from resin or plastic, which may be reinforced with fibers such as <b>aramids.</b>|$|R
25|$|Kevlar is the {{registered}} trademark for a para-aramid synthetic fiber, related to other <b>aramids</b> such as Nomex and Technora.

50|$|Conductive fibers {{consist of}} a {{non-conductive}} or less conductive substrate, which is then either coated or embedded with electrically conductive elements, often carbon, nickel, copper, gold, silver, or titanium. Substrates typically include cotton, polyester, nylon, and stainless steel to high performance fibers such as <b>aramids</b> and PBO. Straddling the worlds of textiles and wires, conductive fibers are sold either by weight or length, and measured in denier or AWG.|$|R
2500|$|Despite the {{benefits}} of plastic heads, drummers in historical reenactment groups such as fife and drum use animal skin heads for historical accuracy. Skin heads are used on most hand drums, including djembes, frame drums, bongos and congas, although in recent years, companies such as Remo have begun manufacturing synthetic counterparts for certain hand drums such as congas. [...] Another common material used for drumheads is <b>aramid</b> fiber, such as kevlar. Kevlar heads are also used in marching percussion.|$|E
2500|$|Laminate: The snowboard's core is also {{sandwiched}} {{on the top}} {{and bottom}} by at least two layers of fiberglass.

DISTRIBUTION Coal Approved for public release; distribution unlimited. 13, ABSTRACT Processabie precursor polymers to <b>aramids,</b> poly(imino- 1, 4 -phenyleneiminocarbonyl-l, 4 phenylenecarbonyl) and poly (imino-l, 3 -phenyleneiminocarbonyl-l, 4 -phenylenecarbonyl), were prepared and studied. The precursor polymers were made from the reaction of 2, 5 -dichlorobicyclo [2. 2. 2 joctane- 1, 4 -dicarbonyl. chloride or 2, 5 -diacetoxybicyclo(2. 2. 2]octane-l, 4 -dicarboxylic acid. The polymeric precursors were subsequently converted In approximately 98 %- 100 % yields, via dehdrohalogenation and retro Diels-Alder reactions to the corresponding <b>aramids</b> by refluxing in IM solution of potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide, or by bulk pyrolysis using aromatization catalysts, such as, ZnCl 2 and dichlorobenzene sulfonic acid.

2500|$|The Shark, {{which was}} {{formally}} announced at AERO Friedrichshafen in April 2007, {{was designed to}} fit into both European UL and US LSA categories. Structurally it {{is a mixture of}} glass- and carbon-fibre composites (whilst fibreglass is utilised to a very limited extent), with PVC foam filled <b>aramid</b> honeycomb structures sandwiched between panels. The wing main spar is a dismountable two piece carbon fibre beam which joins under the front seat; an auxiliary spar carries the aileron and flap mountings. In plan the leading edge is elliptical and there is slight taper on the outer trailing edge where the ailerons are mounted. Single slotted, electrically operated flaps occupy the rest of the trailing edge. Like the wings, the slightly swept tailplanes are easily detached for storage of transport. [...] There is an electrically operated trim tab in the elevator.|$|E
2500|$|The two well-armored men {{had fired}} {{approximately}} 1,100 rounds, while approximately 650 rounds were fired by police. Following their training, the responding patrol officers directed their {{fire at the}} [...] "center of mass," [...] or torsos, of Mătăsăreanu and Phillips. However, <b>aramid</b> body armor worn by Phillips and Mătăsăreanu covered all of their vitals (except their heads) while providing more bullet resistance than standard-issue police Kevlar vests, enabling them to absorb pistol bullets and shotgun pellets, while Mătăsăreanu's chest armor, thanks to a metal trauma plate, even successfully withstood a hit from a SWAT officer's AR-15. The service pistols carried by the first responding officers had insufficient range and relatively poor accuracy, and additionally they were pinned down by the robbers' high rate of fire, {{making it difficult to}} attempt a headshot. Each robber was shot and penetrated by at least ten bullets, yet both were able to continue shooting.|$|E
2500|$|Hinckley {{introduced}} the JetStick, Dual Guard composite material, {{and the use}} of fiberglass. The first experiments with fiberglas began during the 1950s and concluded with the creation of the B40 in 1959. Despite much criticism such as the comparison of fiberglass to “frozen snot,” Hinckley used the material in boatbuilding [...] Hinckley created Dual Guard technology in 1999, a composite composed of an <b>aramid</b> and carbon fiber, aimed at creating a stronger and more efficient hull. [...] In 2016, the company launched a remote monitoring system called OnWatch. OnWatch uses a series of sensors to track numerous data points on a boat and relay them via a cellular system to servers that update a mobile Web site (it feels like an app when you add the OnWatch icon to your smartphone homescreen). Once you log in, it gives you a homescreen with an at-a-glance understanding of how your boat is doing, from technical details such as engine status, bilge, battery, and fuel-tank levels, to the state of your shore power connectivity.|$|E
50|$|Polyamides occur both {{naturally}} and artificially. Examples of {{naturally occurring}} polyamides are proteins, such as wool and silk. Artificially made polyamides {{can be made}} through step-growth polymerization or solid-phase synthesis yielding materials such as nylons, <b>aramids,</b> and sodium poly(aspartate). Synthetic polyamides are commonly used in textiles, automotive applications, carpets and sportswear due to their high durability and strength. The transportation manufacturing industry is the major consumer, accounting for 35% of polyamide (PA) consumption.|$|R
50|$|PBO (Poly (p-phenylene-2, 6-benzobisoxazole)) is {{liquid crystal}} polymer {{developed}} by Japan-based Toyobo under the trade name Zylon. It is a gold fiber with an initial modulus that is significantly higher than other high modulus yarns, including <b>aramids.</b> Among PBO's desirable properties are high thermal stability, low creep, high chemical resistance, high cut and abrasion resistance, and excellent resistance to stretch after repeated folding. PBO is also quite flexible and has a soft feel. But PBOs have poor resistance to both UV and visible light.|$|R
50|$|Due to its efficacy, {{chrysotile}} asbestos {{was often a}} component in brake linings. However, studies such as a 1989 National Institutes of Health item showed an uncommonly high proportion of brake mechanics were afflicted with pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, {{both of which are}} linked to chrysotile and asbestos exposure. Public health authorities generally recommend against inhaling brake dust, chrysotile has been banned in many developed countries, such as Australia in late 2003, and chrysotile has been progressively replaced in most brake linings and pads by other fibers such as the synthetic <b>aramids.</b>|$|R
