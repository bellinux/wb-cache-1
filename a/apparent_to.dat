5|$|The {{last heir}} <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> the French throne to be crowned during his father's {{lifetime}} was the future Philip II, while the only crowned heir <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> the English throne was Henry the Young King, who was first crowned alone {{and then with}} his wife, Margaret of France. The practice was eventually abandoned by all kingdoms that had adopted it, as the rules of primogeniture became stronger. The last coronation of an heir apparent, {{with the exception of}} investitures of the Prince of Wales in 1911 and 1969, was the coronation of the future Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria as junior King of Hungary in 1830.|$|E
5|$|Ashley-Cooper was the {{grandson}} of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 9th Earl of Shaftesbury. Ashley-Cooper's father was the heir <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> the earldom and its subsidiary titles, but he predeceased his father. His death made his son next {{in the line of}} succession. When his grandfather died in 1961, Ashley-Cooper became the 10th Earl of Shaftesbury, Baron Ashley of Wimborne St Giles and Baron Cooper of Pawlett.|$|E

5|$|George's grandfather, King George II, {{disliked the}} Prince of Wales, and took little {{interest}} in his grandchildren. However, in 1751 the Prince of Wales died unexpectedly from a lung injury, and George became heir <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> the throne. He inherited one of his father's titles and became the Duke of Edinburgh. Now more interested in his grandson, three weeks later the King created George Prince of Wales (the title is not automatically acquired).|$|E
5|$|It became <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> the {{investigating}} science {{team that}} radial velocity data alone could not prove {{the existence of}} HAT-P-33b. As such, photometric observations of HAT-P-33 were conducted using the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory's 1.2-meter telescope, which hosted the KeplerCam CCD instrument. This data was used to create the light curve of HAT-P-33. In doing so, a slight dimming was observed where HAT-P-33b was believed to have transited its star.|$|E
5|$|Richard of Bordeaux was {{the younger}} son of Edward, the Black Prince, and Joan of Kent. Edward, heir <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> {{the throne of}} England, had {{distinguished}} himself as a military commander in the early phases of the Hundred Years' War, particularly in the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. After further military adventures, however, he contracted dysentery in Spain in 1370. He never fully recovered and {{had to return to}} England the next year.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the first}} year of opening it became <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> the {{management}} and investors that the estimated passenger numbers for the BS and the other UERL lines were over-optimistic. Despite improved integration and cooperation with the other tube railways and the later extensions, the BS struggled financially. In 1933, the BS was taken into public ownership along with the UERL. Today, the BS's tunnels and stations operate as the London Underground's Bakerloo line.|$|E
5|$|A major {{difficulty}} {{the team}} encountered was converting all game elements into a fully-3D world, including {{the sound and}} radio stations, as well as designing and voicing the non-player characters, due to the amount that existed within the open world; producer Dan Houser {{said that there was}} about 8,000 lines of recorded dialogue in the game, while audio programmer Raymond Usher estimated about 18,000. The basic technical elements of the game began to work together in mid-2000, with a carjacking mechanic prototype and stable streaming model. Streaming was initially intended to be reserved for music and map geometry, but other elements were eventually included when it became <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> the team as more data was entered.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{literary}} critics Maman S. Mahayana, Oyon Sofyan, and Achmad Dian, Hasan's psychological struggles reflect Sigmund Freud's theories on psychoanalysis. Teeuw notes that Hasan {{comes across as}} being disappointed that his traditional religious upbringing {{is not enough to}} overcome the temptations of the modern world. Poet and critic of Indonesian literature Muhammad Balfas writes that Hasan's conflict arises from being torn intellectually between the teachings of his ultra-religious father and the Marxist Rusli, {{while at the same time}} being emotionally victimised by the ever self-confident Anwar. Balfas notes that three versions of Hasan are made <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> the reader: Hasan's view of himself, the narrator's view of Hasan, and the narrator's reconstruction of Hasan.|$|E
5|$|After the Third Battle of Ypres petered out in late 1917, the Western Front {{fell into}} its usual lull {{over the winter}} months. In early 1918, it became <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> the Allies that a large German {{offensive}} was pending. This Spring Offensive commenced on 21 March 1918, with over one million men in three German armies striking hard near the junction between the French and British armies. The main effort of this offensive hit the British Fifth Army, which formed the right flank of the British front line. Struck a staggering blow, it began a rapid and at times panicked withdrawal. The key railway junction at Amiens was soon threatened.|$|E
5|$|Although Dickinson's acquaintances {{were most}} likely aware of her writing, {{it was not until}} after her death in 1886—when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, {{discovered}} her cache of poems—that the breadth of her work became <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> the public. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, though both heavily edited the content. A complete, and mostly unaltered, collection of her poetry became available for the first time when scholar Thomas H. Johnson published The Poems of Emily Dickinson in 1955.|$|E

5|$|At age 37, Mary {{turned her}} {{attention}} to finding a husband and producing an heir, which would prevent the Protestant Elizabeth (still next-in-line under the terms of Henry VIII's will and the Act of Succession of 1544) from succeeding to the throne. Edward Courtenay and Reginald Pole were both mentioned as prospective suitors, but her cousin Charles V suggested she marry his only son, Prince Philip of Spain. Philip had a son from a previous marriage and was heir <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> vast territories in Continental Europe and the New World. As part of the marriage negotiations, a portrait of Philip, by Titian, was sent to her in September 1553.|$|E
5|$|Charles was {{the second}} son of King James VI of Scotland, but after his father {{inherited}} the English throne in 1603, he moved to England, where {{he spent much of}} the rest of his life. He became heir <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> the English, Irish, and Scottish thrones on the death of his elder brother, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, in 1612. An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to the Spanish Habsburg princess Maria Anna culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the futility of the marriage negotiations. Two years later, he married the Bourbon princess Henrietta Maria of France instead.|$|E

Pedro Afonso was seen as vital to the future viability of the monarchy, which had been put in jeopardy by the death of his older brother Dom Afonso almost three years earlier.|$|E

In addition, the security advantage of a buffer zone was recognised as irrelevant and the Soviets officially declared that they would no longer intervene in the affairs of allied states in Central and Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Edmund FitzAlan {{was born}} in the Castle of Marlborough, in Wiltshire, on 1 May 1285. He was the son of Richard FitzAlan, 8th Earl of Arundel, and his wife, Alice of Saluzzo, {{daughter}} of Thomas I of Saluzzo in Italy. Richard had been in opposition to the king during the political crisis of 1295, and as a result he had incurred great debts and had parts of his land confiscated. When Richard died in 09/03/1301, Edmund's wardship was given to John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey. Warenne's only son, William, had died in 1286, so his daughter Alice was now heir <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> the Warenne earldom. Alice was offered in marriage to Edmund, who for unknown reasons initially refused her. By 1305 he had changed his mind, however, and the two were married.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth was {{two years}} and eight months old when her mother was {{beheaded}} on 19 May 1536, four months after Catherine of Aragon's death from natural causes.

Eleven days after Anne Boleyn's execution, Henry married Jane Seymour, who died shortly after the birth of their son, Prince Edward, in 1537. From his birth, Edward was undisputed heir <b>apparent</b> <b>to</b> the throne. Elizabeth was placed in his household and carried the chrisom, or baptismal cloth, at his christening.|$|E
