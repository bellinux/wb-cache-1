40|$|Abstract—The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop an advanced driver assistance system characterized with the functions of lane departure warning (LDW), forward collision warning (FCW) and <b>adaptive</b> <b>front-lighting</b> <b>system</b> (AFS). The system is mainly configured a CCD/CMOS camera to acquire the images of roadway ahead in association with the analysis made by an image-processing unit concerning the lane ahead and the preceding vehicles. The input image captured by a camera is used to recognize the lane and the preceding vehicle positions by image detection and DROI (Dynamic Range of Interesting) algorithms. Therefore, the system is able to issue real-time auditory and visual outputs of warning when a driver is departing the lane or driving too close to approach the preceding vehicle unwittingly so that the danger could be prevented from occurring. During the nighttime, in addition to the foregoing warning functions, the system is able to control the bending light of headlamp to provide an immediate light illumination when making a turn at a curved lane and adjust the level automatically to reduce the lighting interference against the oncoming vehicles driving in the opposite direction by the curvature of lane and the vanishing point estimations. The experimental results show that the integrated vehicle image system is robust to most environments such as the lane detection and preceding vehicle detection average accuracy performances are both above 90 %.

Fuzzy logic is a well-known extension of the conventional (Boolean) logic that enables the treatment of uncertainty present in the information through the definition of intermediary membership values between the “completely true” and the “completely false”. This technique or modeling strategy is particularly important when a multi-parameter decision must be taken or the decisions are based on the human knowledge.

40|$|The {{function}} of <b>adaptive</b> <b>front-lighting</b> <b>system</b> {{is to improve}} the lighting condition of the road ahead and driving safety at night. The current system seldom considers characteristics of the driver’s preview behavior and eye movement. To solve this problem, an AFS algorithm modeling a driver’s preview behavior was proposed. According to the vehicle’s state, the driver’s manipulating input, and the vehicle’s future state change which resulted from the driver’s input, a dynamic predictive algorithm of the vehicle’s future track was established based on an optimal preview acceleration model. Then, an experiment on the change rule of the driver’s preview distance with different speeds and different road curvatures was implemented with the eye tracker and the calibration method of the driver’s preview time was established. On the basis of these above theories and experiments, the preview time was introduced to help predict the vehicle’s future track and an AFS algorithm modeling the driver’s preview behavior was built. Finally, a simulation analysis of the AFS algorithm was carried out. By analyzing the change process of the headlamp’s lighting region while bend turning which was controlled by the algorithm, its control effect was verified to be precise...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Front-lighting</b> <b>System</b> (AFS) {{has been}} widely {{concerned}} {{in the area of}} traffic safety. Firstly, it's an analysis of research achievements about control method and mathematics model of AFS, and the question is focused on the lag of headlamp control system, which means the actual bending angle of AFS always lags behind the steering-wheel angle. Then, a study of how to solve this lag has been proceeded. After the geometrical relations among safety braking distance and the rate of steering-wheel angle and turning radius of the vehicle is analyzed, an mathematics model considered these variables has been set up. In order to improve the road illumination of the bending beginning stage, a preview control method and the control algorithm of preview model, rolling optimization and feedback correction have been set up. Based on this preview control algorithm, a simulation model of the whole AFS has been built as well as the AFS control experiment platform. After a comparison between preview control and servo control, it can be discovered that preview control method is superior to servo control in AFS system. Introduction： Now the AFS headlamp control systems in most articles are servo control systems which mainly use signal of the steering-wheel angle that is obtained in real time and signal of speed to calculate th...|$|R

40|$|Road {{accidents}} {{at night}} are disproportionately high in numbers and severity compared to day, {{and the major}} factor contributing to this problem is darkness because of its great influence on the driver's behaviour and ability. To provide visibility to the driver in unlit areas, vehicles are equipped with headlamps which illuminate the road ahead. But {{in the presence of}} oncoming traffic, using low beam is compulsory to minimize headlight glare. Hence, designing headlamps which maximize roadway visibility for the driver and minimize the nuisance to other road users at the same time is a challenge. There are at least two different approaches to evaluate the performance of <b>front-lighting</b> <b>systems.</b> Those who design and manufacture headlamps use standard criteria which are directly related to the headlamp beam pattern. Some of these criteria are related to safety, such as the 3 -lux line, and others are related to comfort, such as the beam spread. Those who use the headlamps (or their representatives) prefer criteria which are directly based on visibility range. They tend to focus on specific targets which are critical in terms of safety, namely pedestrians, pavement markings and signs. Implementing the latter, driver-oriented approach involves conventional traffic scenarios, which actually form the basis of the standard criteria of the former, vehicle-oriented approach. Visibility Level (VL) is the index which is most often used to assess the performance of lighting systems in a driver-oriented approach, not only for vehicle lighting systems, but for road lighting systems as well. VL is the ratio between the actual contrast of a target and the threshold contrast which is needed to detect to target. The threshold is usually computed by means of an empirical vision model based on laboratory data, and the operational viewing conditions are accounted for by means of a field factor based on road tests. In this paper we focus on the impact of the road environment on the VL-based performance of a lighting system. After reviewing the VL-based approaches to evaluate lighting systems, we present a night-time visibility meter based on measured pavement reflection properties, developed for road operators to evaluate the quality of service of their network in terms of the visibility offered to the drivers. We discuss how the data from this system could feed advanced <b>front-lighting</b> <b>systems</b> or infrastructure-vehicle cooperative systems to improve road safety at night...|$|R
