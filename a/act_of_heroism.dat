5000|$|A need to {{recognize}} <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>heroism</b> in 1922 resulted in the War Department's issuing orders for <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> bravery during peacetime.

The Secretary of War directed that the Quartermaster General prepare and submit appropriate designs of the Soldier’s Medal per letter signed by The Adjutant General dated 11 August 1926.|$|R

25|$|Piérola {{has been}} criticised {{because of his}} sectarianism, {{frivolous}} investment, bombastic decrees, lack of control in budget, {{but it must be}} said that he put forth an enormous effort to obtain new funds and to mobilize the country for the war.

25|$|This {{icy water}} rescue {{is said to}} have {{exacerbated}} Peter's bladder problems and caused his death. The story, however, has been viewed with skepticism by some historians, pointing out that the German chronicler Jacob von Stählin is the only source for the story, and it seems unlikely that no one else would have documented such an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>heroism.</b> This, plus the interval of time between these actions and Peter's death seems to preclude any direct link.|$|E

25|$|Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That in {{recognition}} of the gallantry of First Lieutenant Frank H. Newcomb, of the Revenue-Cutter Service, commanding the revenue cutter Hudson, his officers and the men of his command, for their intrepid and heroic gallantry in the action at Cardenas, Cuba, on the eleventh day of May, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, when the Hudson rescued the United States naval torpedo boat Winslow {{in the face of a}} most galling fire from the enemy's guns, the Winslow being disabled, her captain wounded, her only other officer and half her crew killed. The commander of the Hudson kept his vessel in the very center of the hottest fire of the action, although in constant danger of going ashore on account of the shallow water, until finally he got a line made fast to the Winslow and towed that vessel out of range of the enemy's guns. In commemoration of this signal <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>heroism</b> it is hereby enacted that the Secretary of the Treasury be authorized and directed to cause to be and to present to First Lieutenant Frank H. Newcomb, Revenue-Cutter Service, a gold medal, and to each of his officers a silver medal, and to each member of his crew a bronze medal.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Eric Goldman, writing for IGN, gave the episode an 8.8 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "great". He referred to [...] "Mars, Bars" [...] {{as one of the}} finest episodes of season three, praising the Valentine's Day subplot, the development of the mystery of Dean O'Dell's death, and Muhney's performance. Regarding Logan, he opined that although he did not like him moping after his breakup with Veronica, this episode fixed that by including him in the Valentine's Day subplot and setting up a romantic relationship with Parker: [...] "it's just a huge relief to see Logan in a different light and interacting with different people, finally." [...] He also praised Lamb's death scene as being devoid of clichés by not giving him an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>heroism</b> for his dying moments. Reviewer Alan Sepinwall, on his blog What's Alan Watching?, lauded the episode. He saw the episode and the previous episode as a return to form for Veronica Mars, writing, [...] "it's episodes like these last two that remind me of what this show looks like when it's really cooking." [...] He also enjoyed the lack of a redemptive moment for Lamb {{at the end of his}} life as well as the comedic value of some scenes in the episode.|$|E

Upon seeing that his ship was about to be captured, he refused to surrender to Genso, the son of Gaiseric, instead leaped overboard in heavy armor and drowned himself.
