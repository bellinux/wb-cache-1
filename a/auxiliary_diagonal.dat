40|$|The calculating of the {{coherent}} {{information is}} a fundamental step in obtaining the quantum capacity of a quantum channel. We introduce orthogonal and complete code basis to evaluate the coherent information per channel use when the input is the maximal mixture of stabilizer codewords. In the code basis, the output density matrix is diagonal, the joint output {{of the system and}} the <b>auxiliary</b> is block <b>diagonal.</b> The coherent information is worked out by counting the weights of error operators.

50|$|It was a {{parasol wing}} glider, though the three part wooden wing was a {{cantilever}} structure, held above the fuselage on two almost vertical streamlined steel struts from the fuselage, one {{on either side}} and by further central, vertical struts, faired in to form a slender ply skinned central pylon. The centre section was rectangular in plan, occupying about {{one third of the}} span; the outer sections were double tapered to semicircular tips. The wing was built around a single spar with plywood skin from it forward around the leading edge forming a torsion resistant box. On the centre section the ply skin extended rearwards to <b>diagonal</b> <b>auxiliary</b> spars and on the lower surface of the outer panels to the aileron hinge. The rest of the wing surface, including the long ailerons was fabric covered.|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} resummation of {{truncated}} perturbation series, related to diagonal Padé approximants but giving results {{independent of the}} renormalization scale, was developed {{more than ten years}} ago by us with a view of applying it in perturbative QCD. We now apply this method in analytic QCD models, i. e., models where the running coupling has no unphysical singularities, and we show that the method has attractive features such as a rapid convergence. The method can be regarded as a generalization of the scale-setting methods of Stevenson, Grunberg, and Brodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie. The method involves the fixing of various scales and weight coefficients via an <b>auxiliary</b> construction of <b>diagonal</b> Padé approximant. In low-energy QCD observables, some of these scales become sometimes low at high order, which prevents the method from being effective in perturbative QCD where the coupling has unphysical singularities at low spacelike momenta. There are no such problems in analytic QCD. Comment: 14 pages; extended presentation of the analytic QCD models in Sec. IV; two references added ([37, 38]); version to appear in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
