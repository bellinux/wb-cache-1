5|$|In Japan, Waseda University {{initiated}} the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the world's first full-scale intelligent humanoid robot, or android. Its limb control system <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> {{to walk with}} the lower limbs, and to grip and transport objects with hands, using tactile sensors. Its vision system <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> to measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors, artificial eyes and ears. And its conversation system <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> to communicate with a person in Japanese, with an artificial mouth.|$|E

5|$|In 1926, West Mersea {{became a}} self-governing urban district, which <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> {{to set up}} a {{self-contained}} water and sewer system. Unlike several other coastal resorts, the island did not immediately develop any holidaymaker facilities aside from the beach huts which now stretch along the Esplanade.|$|E

5|$|After 65 days of filming in New Orleans, Woo {{had trouble}} with the Motion Picture Association of America to secure the R rating that Universal wanted. Woo made dozens of cuts to the film until the MPAA <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> an R rating. On its initial release, Hard Target was a {{financial}} success but received mixed reviews from film critics.|$|E
5|$|Although the weapon's {{designers}} {{thought that}} simply bringing {{a critical mass}} together would be sufficient, Serber suggested that the design should also include an initiator. A polonium-210-beryllium initiator was chosen because polonium 210 has a 140-day half life, which <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> to be stockpiled, {{and it could be}} obtained from naturally occurring ores from Port Hope, Ontario. Oppenheimer requested that it also be manufactured in the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee or, when they became available, the reactors at the Hanford Site.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2005, the Washington Blade {{also ran}} a free news {{clipping}} service called the BladeWire. This service collected news stories {{of interest to}} the LGBT community from a variety of local, state, regional, national, and selected international media sources. The service was generated by the Blades editors and was published on the internet. A feature of the BladeWire also <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> to be syndicated onto other websites using JavaScript.|$|E

This {{included}} tests to investigate the properties of isotopes such as tritium and determine the neutron capture cross section of elements and compounds that might be used to construct future reactors, or occur in impurities. They were also used for trials of instrumentation, and in experiments to determine thermal stability of materials, and to train operators.|$|E

50|$|It is {{designed}} to undertake certain tasks otherwise done by infantry soldiers, such as convoy protection, armed reconnaissance and others. It moves on six wheels, but these can be replaced with tracks. The robot is capable of traversing uneven terrain and going over some obstacles such as low walls. Robattle's modularity <b>allows</b> <b>it</b> to be fitted with robotic arms, radars and weapons, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> to engage in combat. As such, sensitive systems in the Robattle are redundant to <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> to operate after taking damage.|$|R

In its red form, it {{controls the}} element of earth, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> to eat through some elements of the scenery. In its green form, it controls the element of air, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> to produce ropes from its hands to swing around the environment and it can also pull different objects with its rope. In its blue form, it controls the element of water, allowing the ability to dive underwater and shooting bubbles that damage hostiles.|$|R
5|$|Each {{show is a}} {{synthesis}} of circus styles from around the world, with its own central theme and storyline. Shows employ continuous live music, with performers rather than stagehands changing the props. After financial successes and failures in the late 1980s, Nouvelle Expérience was created – with the direction of Franco Dragone – which not only made Cirque du Soleil profitable by 1990, but <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> to create new shows.|$|E

The fair had been {{scheduled}} to close two days earlier, however a two-day extension granted by the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> to continue over the weekend. On the final day 221,554 visitors added to the more than 50 million (50,306,648) that attended Expo 67 at a time when Canada's population was only 20 million, setting a per-capita record for World Exhibition attendance that still stands.|$|E
5|$|In 1562 the château came briefly {{into the}} {{possession}} of the Huguenots and {{was turned into a}} state prison by Henry IV of France. Cardinal Richelieu was given the castle to prevent it from coming under the control of unfriendly forces, though he <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> to fall into ruin. Château de Chinon was abandoned until 1793 when, during the Reign of Terror, the castle was temporarily occupied by royalist Vendeans. Soon after, the castle lapsed back into decay.|$|E
50|$|A few snakes do {{not conform}} to these categories. Atractaspis is solenoglyphous but the fangs swing out sideways, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> to strike without opening its mouth, perhaps <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> to hunt in small tunnels. Scolecophidia (blind {{burrowing}} snakes) typically have few teeth, often only in the upper jaw or lower jaw.|$|R

5|$|In 1840 a {{group of}} local {{businessmen}} led by Jonathan Richardson set up {{the first of several}} iron companies in Consett (County Durham), the Derwent Iron Company, to quarry and smelt ironstone around the town. The best local ironstone (with the highest iron content) was exhausted soon after, so the company arranged for extensions to the local railways, such as the Stockton and Darlington Railway. These <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> to access new sources of ironstone, including, from 1851 onwards, ore from the Cleveland Ironstone Formation near Eston, Cleveland.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Dal Sasso et al.. {{reported}} {{the results of}} X-ray computed tomography of the MSNM V4047 snout. As the foramina on the outside all communicated with a space {{on the inside of}} the snout, the authors speculated that Spinosaurus had pressure receptors inside the space that <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> to hold its snout at the surface of the water to detect swimming prey species without seeing them.|$|E
5|$|In passing across Florida, Katrina did not attain {{any more}} {{strength}} but {{did manage to}} maintain hurricane status. After passing over Florida, the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> to rapidly intensify to the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane in recorded history. Afterward, Katrina made landfall as a Category3 storm near Buras-Triumph, Louisiana, and once more near the Mississippi/Louisiana border. Katrina progressed northward through the central United States and finally dissipated near the Great Lakes on August 31, when it was absorbed by a cold front.|$|E

5|$|On 26 December 1947, the {{inactive}} formation was redesignated as the 95th Mechanized Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop. It {{was then}} activated on 9 January 1948 at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. On 17 December 1948, the brigade headquarters {{was moved to}} Stillwater, Oklahoma. On 30 June 1949, the troop was again reorganized as the 95th Reconnaissance Company. This <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> {{to take on a}} larger structure and control more personnel. The formation was inactivated on 15 September 1951 at Stillwater, Oklahoma.|$|E
5|$|Pyramid D1 is on {{the east}} side of the Group D plaza. The pyramid had three stepped levels erected upon a low base. It faces west towards the plaza and had a single access {{stairway}} flanked by sloping balustrades that terminate in vertical sections at the upper extremes. The pyramid was of fine workmanship using well-cut stone slabs. However, itw was poorly preserved and the southern part had partially collapsed. The surviving portions of the building <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> to be accurately restored by archaeologists.|$|E
