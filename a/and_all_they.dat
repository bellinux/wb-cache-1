Also, some of the pilots were women. Their peashooter was no threat unless they had a very lucky hit on you. I didn't open fire til the aircraft filled my whole windscreen. If I did this, I would get one every time.|$|E
25|$|Duran Duran {{was founded}} by {{childhood}} friends John Taylor and Nick Rhodes along with singer/songwriter Stephen Duffy in 1978, but Duffy left a year later, convinced they weren't going anywhere. The band went through a long succession of lineup changes after Duffy's departure, but finally settled on a guitarist and drummer. The band had a powerful pop sound flavoured with disco, funk and electronics, built on a solid rock rhythm section, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> needed was a charismatic singer with a distinctive voice.|$|E
25|$|German {{machine gun}} crews in the towers that guarded the western {{approach}} to the bridge opened up on the advancing American troops.

2500|$|An initial move to England in the 1930s became {{permanent}} {{because of}} {{his opposition to the}} Nazi party. [...] "My hatred of Hitler and the Nazis, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> stood for, was so overwhelming that no argument could counter it." [...] (p.40) Because of his German citizenship, he was initially unable to gain employment, and was almost interned during the war. He received his PhD in 1940 from University College London (UCL) working in the Department of Psychology under the supervision of Professor Sir Cyril Burt, with whom he had a tumultuous professional relationship throughout his working life.

2500|$|Another famous fantasy {{episode was}} [...] "Atomic Shakespeare," [...] which {{featured}} the cast performing {{a variation of}} The Taming of the Shrew, with David {{in the role of}} Petruchio, Maddie as Katharina, Agnes as Bianca, and Herbert as Lucentio. The episode featured Shakespearean costumes and mixed the Shakespearean plot with humorous anachronisms and variations on Moonlightings own running gags, including David riding in as Petruchio on a horse with BMW logos embroidered on its saddle blanket and repeatedly launching into the wrong Shakespearean soliloquy until the rest of the cast corrects him on which play he is in, and the Blue Moon office itself serving as Petruchio and Katharina's estate. The characters perform the Shakespearean dialogue in iambic pentameter, and the episode was wrapped by segments featuring a boy imagining the episode's proceedings because his mother forced him to do his Shakespeare homework instead of watching Moonlighting, which the mother described as [...] "That show about two detectives? A man and a woman? And they argue all the time <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> really want to do is sleep together? Sounds like trash to me!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Foote's first {{training}} for the stage came {{under the tutelage of}} Charles Macklin. By 1744, when they appeared onstage together, Macklin had {{made a name for himself}} as one of the most notable actors on the British stage, after David Garrick. His appearance as Shylock in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice at the Drury Lane Theatre in 1741, mesmerized London audiences. Dismissing the conventional comedic approach to the character, Macklin played the character as consummately evil. Following his debut, George II reportedly could not sleep, while Georg Lichtenberg described Macklin's interpretation of Shylock's first line—"Three thousand ducats"—as being uttered [...] "as lickerously as if he were savouring the ducats <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> would buy." [...] Following less than a year of training, Foote appeared opposite Macklin's Iago as the titular role in Shakespeare's Othello at the Haymarket Theatre, 6 February 1744. While his first appearance was unsuccessful, it is noted that this production was produced illegally under the Licensing Act of 1737 which forbid the production of plays by theatres not holding letters patent or the production of plays not approved by the Lord Chamberlain. In order to skirt this law, the Haymarket Theatre held musical concerts with plays included gratis.|$|E
2500|$|Barnett quotes {{additional}} {{criticism of}} Race, Intelligence and Education from Sandra Scarr-Salapatek, {{who wrote in}} 1976 that Eysenck's book was [...] "generally inflammatory" [...] and that there [...] "is something in this book to insult almost everyone except WASPs and Jews." [...] Scarr was equally critical of Eysenck's hypotheses, {{one of which was}} the supposition that slavery on plantations had selected African Americans as a less intelligent sub-sample of Africans. Scarr also criticised another statement of Eysenck on the alleged significantly lower IQs of Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Greek immigrants in the US relative to the populations in their country of origin. [...] "Although Eysenck is careful to say that these are not established facts (because no IQ tests were given to the immigrants or nonimmigrants in question?" [...] Scarr writes that the careful reader would conclude that [...] "Eysenck admits that scientific evidence to date does not permit a clear choice of the genetic-differences interpretation of black inferiority on intelligence tests," [...] whereas a [...] "quick reading of the book, however, is sure to leave the reader believing that scientific evidence today strongly supports the conclusion that US blacks are genetically inferior to whites in IQ." [...] Some of Eysenck's later work was funded from the Pioneer Fund, an organization often criticised for allegedly promoting scientific racism, However, Eysenck himself was vehemently opposed to racism. As Eysenck stated, [...] "My hatred of Hitler and the Nazis, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>they</b> stood for, was so overwhelming that no argument could counter it (p. 40)." ...|$|E
