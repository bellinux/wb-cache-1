5|$|Tang has {{expressed}} concern about environmental and social issues through his art, such as the works They Poach the Rhino, Chop Off His Horn <b>and</b> <b>Make</b> <b>This</b> Drink (1989), Under the Table All Going One Direction (1992) and Tiger's Whip. He first presented the latter work, an installation and performance piece, in 1991 in Singapore's Chinatown. It consisted of ten life-sized tigers made from wire mesh covered with white linen. Tang, wearing a sleeveless white garment, dragged one of the tigers behind him. A {{modified version of the}} installation is in the Singapore Art Museum. It features a tiger with its front paws resting {{on the back of a}} rocking chair, which is draped with a piece of red cloth and with a phallus painted on it in red. The work highlights how the tiger is being hunted to extinction for its penis, which some Chinese believe has aphrodisiac qualities. In February 1995, the Museum chose Tiger's Whip to represent Singapore at the Africus International Biennale in Johannesburg, South Africa. Another of Tang's works in the Singapore Art Museum is an untitled sculpture often called Axe (1991), which is an axe with a plant growing out of its wooden handle. It is regarded as an early example of found art in Singapore.|$|E
25|$|Tingible body macrophages (TBMs)– large {{phagocytic}} {{cells in}} the germinal centers of secondary lymph nodes– express CD68 protein. These cells normally engulf B cells that have undergone apoptosis after somatic hypermutation. In some people with SLE, significantly fewer TBMs can be found, and these cells rarely contain material from apoptotic B cells. Also, uningested apoptotic nuclei can be found outside of TBMs. This material may present {{a threat to the}} tolerization of B cells and T cells. Dendritic {{cells in the}} germinal center may endocytose such antigenic material and present it to T cells, activating them. Also, apoptotic chromatin and nuclei may attach to the surfaces of follicular dendritic cells <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> material available for activating other B cells that may have randomly acquired self-specificity through somatic hypermutation. Necrosis, a pro-inflammatory form of cell death, is increased in T lymphocytes, due to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and depletion of ATP.|$|E
25|$|Evacuation aids (suppositories or enemas) e.g. {{glycerine}} or bisacodyl suppositories may be prescribed. People {{may have}} poor resting {{tone of the}} anal canal, and consequently {{may not be able}} to retain an enema, in which case transanal irrigation (retrograde anal irrigation) may be a better option, as this equipment utilizes an inflatable catheter to prevent loss of the irrigation tip and to provide a water tight seal during irrigation. A volume of lukewarm water is gently pumped into the colon via the anus. People can be taught how to perform this treatment in their own homes, but it does require special equipment. If the irrigation is efficient, stool will not reach the rectum again for up to 48 hours. By regularly emptying the bowel using transanal irrigation, controlled bowel function is often re-established to a high degree in patients with bowel incontinence and/or constipation. This enables control over the time and place of evacuation and development of a consistent bowel routine. However, persistent leaking of residual irrigation fluid during the day may occur <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> option unhelpful, particularly in persons with obstructed defecation syndrome who may have incomplete evacuation of any rectal contents. Consequently, the best time to carry out the irrigation is typically in the evening, allowing any residual liquid to be passed the next morning before leaving the home. Complications such as electrolyte imbalance and perforation are rare. The effect of transanal irrigation varies considerably. Some individuals experience complete control of incontinence, and other report little or no benefit. It has been suggested that if appropriate, people be offered home retrograde anal irrigation.|$|E

[...] An environmental impact study has been conducted by Rutgers University’s Transportation Policy Institute and Center for Negotiation and Conflict Resolution to improve US 1 through the Penns Neck area.

[...] In addition, CR 571 is planned to be realigned to intersect US 1 further to the north. In 2009, the segment of US 1 between I-287 in Edison and the Garden State Parkway in Woodbridge was rebuilt to include new ramps at several intersections and removed access {{to a couple of}} roads in a $53.9 million project that was intended to alleviate traffic <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> section safer.|$|E
500|$|Kid Klown in Krazy Chase {{received}} mixed reception. It {{holds an}} aggregate score of 64.17% on GameRankings based on three reviews. Author Andy Slaven {{wrote that the}} only problem with the game was its [...] "strange" [...] three-quarter perspective. Nintendo Power gave it a 3.375 out of 5.

[...] Goldman particularly praised Caan's performance in the episode, stating he [...] "is very good, bringing a lot of humor to the part and finding an easy chemistry with O'Loughlin.
