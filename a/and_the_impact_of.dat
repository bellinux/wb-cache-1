Following the end of military rule and return of democracy to Chile in 1990, investigation of human rights violations became a top priority. Though a 1978 amnesty decree prevented prosecution for pre-1978 offenses, the new Aylwin government sought disclosure of the truth and recompense for the victim's families and appointed a National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation. The commission's February 1991 Rettig Report named victims disappeared shortly after the coup, executed by gunshot, and presumed {{to be buried in}} Patio 29.

5|$|Predators of waders {{breeding}} in wet grasslands include birds such {{as large}} gulls, common raven, carrion and hooded crows, and great and Arctic skuas; foxes occasionally take waders, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> feral cats and stoats is unknown. Overgrazing can increase predation by making nests easier to find. In captivity, the main causes of chick mortality were stress-related sudden death and twisted neck syndrome. Adults seem to show {{little evidence of}} external parasites, but may have significant levels of disease on their tropical wintering grounds, including avian malaria in their inland freshwater habitats, and so they {{might be expected to}} invest strongly in their immune systems; however, a 2006 study that analysed the blood of migrating ruffs intercepted in Friesland showed that this bird actually has unexplained low levels of immune responses on at least one measure of resistance. The ruff can breed from its second year, and the average lifespan for birds that have passed the chick stage is about 4.4 years, although a Finnish bird lived to a record 13 years and 11 months.|$|E

5|$|Rosas' early {{administration}} was {{preoccupied with the}} severe deficits, large public debts <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> currency devaluation which his government inherited. A great drought that began in December 1828, which would last until April 1832, greatly impacted the economy. The Unitarians were still at large, controlling several provinces that had banded together in the Unitarian League. The capture of José María Paz, the main Unitarian leader, in March 1831 resulted {{in the end of}} the Unitarian–Federalist civil war and the collapse of the Unitarian League. Rosas was content, for the moment, to agree to recognize provincial autonomy in the Federal Pact. In an effort to alleviate the government's financial problems, he improved revenue collection while not raising taxes and curtailed expenditure.|$|E
5|$|Siva (also spelt Shiva) is a 1989 Indian Telugu-language crime drama film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Ram Gopal Varma in his directorial debut. Produced by Akkineni Venkat and Yarlagadda Surendra under their banners of Annapurna Studios and SS Creations, Siva starred Akkineni Nagarjuna, Amala, and Raghuvaran. The film's basic plot, adapted from Bruce Lee Way of the Dragon (1972), revolves around the conflict between college student-turned-gangster Siva and Bhavani, a reputed crime boss mentored by the politician Machiraju. Siva explores the concepts of student exploitation by anti-social elements <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> crowd psychology.|$|E
5|$|The general {{election}} {{resulted in a}} victory for Tony Blair's Labour Party, which adopted a pro-EU stance. Their victory was considered a landslide, thus making the Referendum Party's role in the election fairly irrelevant. The Conservatives had gained only 30.7% of the vote, a drop from the 41.9% they had attained in 1992 and the lowest vote share that they had received since the establishment of modern British party politics in 1832. Their representation in the House of Commons fell by over half, from 343 to 165; their lowest representation in the House since 1906. The reasons for their electoral decline were many <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> the Referendum Party was not a major factor.|$|E

5|$|The whaling {{industry}} {{peaked in}} 1857, when New Bedford accounted {{for half the}} U.S. fleet. Growing competition from the new petroleum industry, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> the Civil War, ensured {{that it would not}} recover as it had in the past. The Bethel was rebuilt after an 1867 fire, with a new exterior and an added tower. The NBIS building became a local courthouse, and the center of commercial activity in New Bedford moved west, where it has remained, as textiles became the city's dominant industry. The whaling museum was established in one of the old buildings in 1907. But ships lost at sea were not replaced as they had been before, and in 1927, the John R. Mantra made the last whaling voyage from the city and the last in American history.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} about how effectively the edict was enforced. Supposedly, inflation, speculation, and monetary instability continued, and a black market arose to trade in goods forced out of official markets. The edict's penalties were applied unevenly across the empire (some scholars believe they were applied only in Diocletian's domains), widely resisted, and eventually dropped, perhaps {{within a year of}} the edict's issue. Lactantius has written of the perverse accompaniments to the edict; of goods withdrawn from the market, of brawls over minute variations in price, of the deaths that came when its provisions were enforced. His account may be true, but it seems to modern historians exaggerated and hyperbolic, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> the law is recorded in no other ancient source.|$|E
