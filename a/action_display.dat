As a result electrodynamic effects, taking place in a near zone of EHF radiators {{with the presence of}} strong absorptive objects in it, have been investigated. It makes it possible to explain feutures of the EHF-radiation biological <b>action</b> <b>display.</b> The possibility of the electrodynamics problem experimental solution has been shown. The investigation results promote the correct interpretation of experimental data about the EHF-radiation biological action.

40|$|Leptin regulates energy balance. However, {{knowledge}} of the critical intracellular transducers of leptin signaling remains incomplete. Here we report that Rho-kinase 1 (ROCK 1) regulates leptin action on body weight homeostasis by activating JAK 2, an initial trigger of leptin receptor signaling. Leptin promotes the physical interaction of JAK 2 and ROCK 1, thereby increasing phosphorylation of JAK 2 and downstream activation of Stat 3 and FOXO 1. Mice lacking ROCK 1 in either POMC or AgRP neurons, mediators of leptin <b>action,</b> <b>display</b> obesity and impaired leptin sensitivity. In addition, deletion of ROCK 1 in the arcuate nucleus markedly enhances food intake, resulting in severe obesity. Of note, ROCK 1 is a specific mediator of leptin, but not insulin, regulation of POMC neuronal activity. Our data identify ROCK 1 as a key regulator of leptin action on energy homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSerotonin {{transporters}} (SERTs), {{sites of}} psychostimulant <b>action,</b> <b>display</b> multiple conducting states in expression systems. These include a substrate-independent transient conductance, two separate substrate-independent leak conductances associated with Na+ and H+, and a substrate-dependent conductance of variable stoichiometry, which exceeds that predicted from electroneutral substrate transport. The present {{data show that}} the SNARE protein syntaxin 1 A binds the N-terminal tail of SERT, and this interaction regulates two SERT-conducting states. First, substrate-induced currents are absent because Na+ flux becomes strictly coupled to 5 HT transport. Second, Na+-mediated leak currents are eliminated. These two SERT-conducting states are present endogenously in thalamocortical neurons, act to depolarize the membrane potential, and are modulated by molecules that disrupt SERT and syntaxin 1 A interactions. These data show that protein interactions govern SERT activity and suggest that both cell excitability and psychostimulant-mediated effects will be dependent upon the state of association among SERT and its interacting partners...|$|E

40|$|A battle space {{contains}} {{information that}} is dynamic, unstructured, uncertain, and temporal. The commander must use this information to plan, analyze, and decide on the “best ” strategy to defeat the enemy. Such information must be context-specific and content-sensitive {{to changes in the}} battle space. Typically, the commander must integrate information from various sources (terrain, weather, resources, equipment, personnel, and mission definition) to develop courses of action and executable operation order. A typical collection asset decision aid will be useful to the commander in planning for resource management, courses of action (COA) analysis, logistics, and sample profiles on the order of battle operation. This paper describes an analytical decision aid for supporting the commander’s courses of action planning and analysis based on battle asset information.

40|$|A restless bandit is used {{to model}} a user's {{interest}} in a topic or item. The interest evolves as a Markov chain whose transition probabilities depend on the <b>action</b> (<b>display</b> the ad or desist) in a time step. A unit reward is obtained if the ad is displayed and if the user clicks on the ad. If no ad is displayed then a fixed reward is assumed. The probability of click-through {{is determined by the}} state of the Markov chain. The recommender never gets to observe the state but in each time step it has a belief, denoted by pi(t); {{about the state of the}} Markov chain. pi(t) evolves as a function of the action and the signal from each state. For the one-armed restless bandit with two states, we characterize the policy that maximizes the infinite horizon discounted reward. We first characterize the value function as a function of the system parameters and then characterize the optimal policies for different ranges of the parameters. We will see that the Gilbert-Elliot channel in which the two states have different success probabilities becomes a special case. For one special case, we argue that the optimal policy is of the threshold type with one threshold; extensive numerical results indicate that this may be true in general...|$|E
