5|$|<b>A</b> <b>contact</b> angle {{less than}} 90° (low contact angle) usually {{indicates}} that wetting {{of the surface}} is very favorable, and the fluid will spread over a large area of the surface. Contact angles greater than 90° (high contact angle) generally means that wetting of the surface is unfavorable, so the fluid will minimize contact with the surface and form a compact liquid droplet.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, 617 Patroclus was {{the first}} Jupiter trojan to be {{identified}} as a binary asteroid. The binary's orbit is extremely close, at 650km, compared to 35,000km for the primary's Hill sphere. The largest Jupiter trojan—624 Hektor— is probably <b>a</b> <b>contact</b> binary with a moonlet.|$|E
5|$|Such {{motion of}} a phase boundary, {{involving}} advancing and receding contact angles, {{is known as}} dynamic wetting. When <b>a</b> <b>contact</b> line advances, covering more of the surface with liquid, the contact angle is increased and generally {{is related to the}} velocity of the contact line. If the velocity of <b>a</b> <b>contact</b> line is increased without bound, the contact angle increases, and as it approaches 180°, the gas phase will become entrained in a thin layer between the liquid and solid. This is a kinetic nonequilibrium effect which results from the contact line moving at such a high speed that complete wetting cannot occur.|$|E

For <b>a</b> receding <b>contact</b> line on <b>a</b> heterogeneous solid surface, it is found that a roughening transition takes place which formally corresponds to the onset of leaving a Landau-Levich film.

50|$|A wire spring relay {{typically}} {{has many}} individual contacts. Each <b>contact</b> is either <b>a</b> fixed <b>contact,</b> {{which does not}} move, or is <b>a</b> moving <b>contact,</b> and is made from a short piece of wire. The contact points are made from small blocks of precious metals, such as palladium, which are spot-welded to the wire springs. The majority of the wire spring relays manufactured in the 1960s had twelve fixed <b>contacts.</b> <b>A</b> normally open (make) <b>contact,</b> <b>a</b> normally closed (break) contact, or both can be provided for each fixed <b>contact.</b> <b>A</b> moving <b>contact</b> consists of two wires projecting out of {{the base of the}} relay, bent slightly inwards in order to exert pressure against the armature.|$|R

5|$|Austrian chemist Othmar Zeidler is {{credited}} with the first synthesis of DDT (DichloroDiphenylTrichloroethane) in 1874. The insecticidal properties of DDT were identified in 1939 by chemist Paul Hermann Müller of Geigy Pharmaceutical. For his discovery of DDT as <b>a</b> <b>contact</b> poison against several arthropods, {{he was awarded the}} 1948 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. In the fall of 1942, samples of the chemical were acquired by the United States, Britain and Germany. Laboratory tests demonstrated that it was highly effective against many insects.|$|E
5|$|Hydrofluoric acid is <b>a</b> <b>contact</b> poison {{with greater}} hazards than many strong acids like sulfuric acid {{even though it}} is weak: it remains neutral in aqueous {{solution}} and thus penetrates tissue faster, whether through inhalation, ingestion or the skin, and at least nine U.S. workers died in such accidents from 1984 to 1994. It reacts with calcium and magnesium in the blood leading to hypocalcemia and possible death through cardiac arrhythmia. Insoluble calcium fluoride formation triggers strong pain and burns larger than 160cm2 (25in2) can cause serious systemic toxicity.|$|E
5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} {{hysteresis}} {{is essentially the}} displacement of <b>a</b> <b>contact</b> line {{such as the one}} in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle hysteresis occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states.|$|E

Through <b>a</b> <b>contact</b> of Mac (Struan Roger), a colleague from his time in Northern Ireland, Craven gains access to a terminal connected to the MI5 computer. He checks the MI5 records for GAIA, Northmoor and Emma and learns that McCroon was acting on the orders of Northmoor Security. He also obtains a three-dimensional map of Northmoor from the computer. Craven contacts Jedburgh and asks him to accompany him inside Northmoor.|$|E

As Scully speaks to Mulder on her cellphone while driving her car, a woman appears on a crosswalk. Scully brakes hard to avoid hitting the woman. As she does so, she narrowly avoids colliding with a diesel truck. She realizes that, had the woman not stepped in her path, the truck would have killed her. When she later arrives {{at the house of}} Azar, she observes that Scully is going through a personal crisis and tries to offer her guidance, but Scully is dismissive.|$|E

Ron Howard had intended to direct the film, but scheduling conflicts led to his replacement by Eastwood. Howard and his Imagine Entertainment partner Brian Grazer produced Changeling alongside Malpaso Productions' Robert Lorenz and Eastwood. Universal Pictures financed and distributed the film.|$|E

5|$|The Young–Dupré {{equation}} (Thomas Young 1805; Anthanase Dupré and Paul Dupré 1869) {{dictates that}} neither γSG nor γSL can {{be larger than}} the sum of the other two surface energies. The consequence of this restriction is the prediction of complete wetting when γSG > γSL + γLG and zero wetting when γSL > γSG + γLG. The lack of a solution to the Young–Dupré equation is an indicator that there is no equilibrium configuration with <b>a</b> <b>contact</b> angle between 0 and 180° for those situations.|$|E

5|$|The {{sound effects}} were {{designed}} by Star Wars veteran Ben Burtt. Whereas the phaser blast noises from the television series were derived from The War of the Worlds (1953), Burtt made his phaser sounds more like his blasters from Star Wars, because Abrams' depiction of phasers were closer to the blasters' bullet-like fire, rather than the steady beams of energy in previous Star Trek films. Burtt reproduced the classic photon torpedo and warp drive sounds: he tapped a long spring against <b>a</b> <b>contact</b> microphone, and combined that with cannon fire. Burtt used a 1960s oscillator to create a musical and emotional hum to the warping and transporting sounds.|$|E
