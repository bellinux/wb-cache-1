50|$|God Medicine {{features}} standard RPG elements. The three characters can level {{up through}} battle and equip weapons and armor. Spells can be learned, {{as well as}} Maphu attacks. After the party collects Maphu gems and gains the special Maphu weapons, they can put the gems in the weapons. Each gem has a different effect depending on what character equips it. Some Maphu attacks need to be charged during battle first. The charges last even if the battle is finished. The player can save <b>anytime,</b> <b>except</b> in battle.|$|R
50|$|Broadcasting in New Zealand was {{deregulated}} in 1989. Restrictions {{on television}} advertising were also revised in 1989, so that TVNZ channels could show advertisements <b>anytime</b> <b>except</b> Christmas Day, Good Friday, and Easter Sunday, and between 6am and noon on Anzac Day. In that year, TV3 {{became the first}} privately owned TV station in the country, finally ending the state monopoly. Restrictions on foreign ownership were also removed, and TV3 was subsequently sold to Canada's CanWest. Sky TV, in which TVNZ originally had a small stake, began broadcasting New Zealand's first pay TV service on three UHF channels.|$|R
50|$|The game plays {{similarly}} {{to many other}} RPGs of the time, although {{there are a few}} significant differences. The graphics are very similar to those of Final Fantasy Legend and Final Fantasy Legend 2. However, battles are reminiscent of Dragon Warrior. Only one character fights (Sam), and only one monster fights at a time. The game features random encounter battles, and the player's progress can be saved <b>anytime,</b> <b>except</b> during battle, by using the select button. Additionally, most of the characters, enemies, and towns in the game are named after different types of food or food-related products.|$|R
40|$|Early {{pregnancy}} factor (EPF) is a pregnancy-dependent, suppressor-releasing hormone, {{which can}} be differentiated from other known pregnancy-associated substances by its physiological, biochemical and immunological characteristics. To date {{studies have shown that}} the presence of EPF in serum at <b>anytime</b> <b>except</b> during pregnancy is pathological and is associated with tumors of germ cell origin. EPF can be detected in serum within hours of fertilization, thus providing for the first time a means of monitoring in vitro the continuing viability of a fertilized egg in vivo. EPF has been shown to be a link between fertilization and immunomodulation. Fertilization of the ovum initiates a chain of events which includes production of EPF. EPF then binds to lymphocytes; releasing soluble suppressor substances, which in turn modulate the mother’s immune system. Thus it is proposed that the conceptus ensures its own defence against immunological rejection...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{implications}} of vehicle recharging on the current electricity grid in California and compares well-to-wheel vehicle emissions for various vehicle and fuel platforms {{at different times of}} day and during different seasons. An hourly electricity dispatch model that accounts for supply, demand, and energy transfers among three regions in the state is used to determine the last generator operating in any given hour for a simulated grid and demand curve in 2010. Emissions rates from these generators are attributed to vehicle demand. Plug-in hybrid vehicles are found to reduce emissions compared to conventional hybrids if recharged <b>anytime</b> <b>except</b> during the 2 % of hours with the highest marginal electricity emissions rates. This threshold is roughly equal to the emissions rate from an average natural gas combustion turbine (peaking plant) plant operating in California. Battery-electric and fuel cell vehicles using hydrogen from natural gas reformation reduce emissions further. The paper also compares likely near-term marginal greenhouse gas emissions rates from the electricity sector to assumed values in California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, and finds that the Statute significantly underestimates likely near-term marginal emissions from the sector, and resulting emissions from plug-in vehicles...|$|R
