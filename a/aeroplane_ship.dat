Sandwiches are used in construction that must have a low weight, but a high stiffness. This indicated racing cars, <b>aeroplane,</b> <b>ship</b> shelters. To understand a sandwich construction, the basis, is to understand the sandwich beam. The are given a short description to find the deflection of the beam. The rest of this project, regards the calculation of a homogeneous, isotropic sandwich shelters. The objective is to reduce the mass of 20 ft sandwich shelters from TAM AS. The background for this project, was the article: “Optimal Stiffness Design Plates with Variable Core Densities”. When we use, the methods described in this article, we find the inverse stiffness of the shelters, and from this optimal facings thickness, shear modulus for the core material and d, to reduce the weight of the shelters. The optimization are do it graphically. In the optimized of the shelters, only the walls are optimized, because the roof and floor is not symmetrical. When we optimize the parameters, the weight of the shelters can be reduce with 43. 2 kg. This are approximately 7. 3 %. To verify the calculation of the inverse stiffness of the shelters, the deflection of the shelters was calculated both analytical and numerical with four random pressures. The largest difference between the analytical and numerical value was only 8. 8 %, which is good. ...|$|E

On the level of serious science it has been up to date to use the word Information in all reports and publishing papers. A lot of semantics have been used and some scientists (Prof. FLEISSNER, Prof HOFKIRCHNER, Prof. CAPURRO and the author) tried to abstract this word to a constant scientific term.

40|$|The use of {{renewable}} energy has increased slowly in most sectors and the transport sector is predominantly depending on traditional fossil fuels notably petrol and diesel. This has created a difficult situation concerning the fuel supply and fuel prices {{as well as an}} increase of emissions of climate gasses. A number of local and regional projects have been carried out and are still ongoing regarding the use {{of renewable}} fuels in the transport sector. Most of those covers captive fleets of busses and lorries but also taxis and other passenger cars are participating. Common for this type of projects are that the fuel distribution system and the supply of fuel normally can be handled within reasonable resources since no extensive distribution system has to be built up. This also means that the experiences from those projects are difficult to apply on a European wide scale. The study "Renewable fuels for cross border transportation" is concentrating on cross border transport and basically leaving small captive fleets outside. It includes all modes of transport. The basis for the study are a) that the long term solutions should be based on the use {{of renewable energy}} for the fuels, b) the fuel distribution issue is the critical part of the development and therefore c) investments in intermediate solutions should fit into a long term concept.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy of the University ofBedford shireThis work investigates new approaches to the container loading problem which {{address the issue of}} how to load three-dimensional, rectangular items (e. g. boxes) into the container {{in such a way that}} maximum utilisation is made of the container space. This problem occurs in several industry sectors where the loading approach places cargo effectively into <b>aeroplanes,</b> <b>ships,</b> trailers or trucks in order to save considerable cost. In carrying out this work, the investigation starts by developing a new heuristic approach to the two-dimensional bin packing problem, which has lower complexity than container loading in the aspects of constraints and geometry. A novel approach, including the heuristic strategies and handling method for remaining areas, is developed that can produce good results when testing with benchmark and real world data. Based on the research for two-dimensional bin packing, a novel heuristic approach is developed to deal with the container loading problem with some practical constraints. The heuristic approach to container loading also includes heuristic strategies and the handling of remaining spaces. The heuristic strategies construct effective loading arrangements where combinations of identical or different box types are loaded in blocks. The handling method for remaining spaces further improves the loading arrangements through the representation, partitioning and merging of remaining spaces. The heuristic approach obtains better volume utilisation and the highest stability compared with other published heuristic approaches. However, it does not achieve as high a volume utilisation as metaheuristic approaches, e. g. genetic algorithms and tabu search. To improve volume utilisation, a new hybrid heuristic approach to the container loading problem is further developed based on the tabu search technique which covers the encoding, evaluation criterion and configuration of neighbourhood and candidate solutions. The heuristic strategies as well as the handling method for remaining spaces developed in the heuristic approach are used in this new hybrid tabu search approach. It is shown that the hybrid approach has better volume utilisation than the published approaches under the condition that all loaded boxes with one hundred per cent support from below. In addition, the experimental results show that both the heuristic and hybrid tabu search approaches can also be applied to the multiple container loading problem...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} {{our knowledge of the}} sound transmission and radiation processes of lightweight wall and floor structures, theoretical models are needed. Detailed models may form a valuable tool. In lightweight floor structures, impact sound insulation is perhaps the most important property to consider. This thesis presents an overview of various solution strategies that may be useful in finding a theoretical model for impact sound insulation. Expressions for the point mobility of infinite plates driven by a rigid indenter are derived. These expressions are needed when determining the deformation close to the excitation area, which is important when studying impact noise to properly describe the interaction between the source and the floor. A detailed three-dimensional thick-plate analysis is used. The excitating pressure is found by means of a variational formulation. The point mobility is calculated by means of numerical integration. The excitation force provided by the ISO tapping machine is examined, partly in relation to the three-dimensional deformation analysis. Results found in the literature are reviewed and reconsidered. Low-frequency asymptotes are derived. A more general impact force description is derived, suited for arbitrary frequency-dependent mobilities of the floor structure. The frequency-dependency of the mobility can be due to local effects, investigated by means of thick-plate theory, and/or global effects, investigated by means of a spatial Fourier transform method. A theoretical model for a point-excited simple lightweight floor is presented. The model is used for the prediction of impact noise level. A comparison between numerical computations and measurements found in the literature is performed. A relatively good correspondence between measurements and calculations can be achieved. Lightweight walls (and floors) are often designed as a framework of studs with plates on each side. The studs can be seen as walls in the cavity, thus introducing finiteness. A prediction model for airborne sound insulation including these effects is presented. Due to variabilities, no structure can be perfectly periodic. The effects of near-periodicity are studied by means of transform technique and the expectation operator. The near-periodicity leads to an increase of the damping (if material damping is present). Resilient devices are commonly used in lightweight structures to decrease the sound transmission in a broad frequency band. Applications of such devices may be found, for example, in resiliently mounted ceilings in <b>aeroplanes,</b> <b>ships</b> and buildings. A measurement method to characterise the two-port acoustic properties of resilient devices is presented...|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} days of the Dinky Toys range <b>aeroplanes</b> and <b>ships</b> formed a {{considerable}} part of the output of the Binns Road factory alongside models of cars, vans and trucks. Both civilian and military aircraft were subjects for the Dinky Toys modellers, and the model of the Spitfire was also sold in a special presentation box between 1939 and 1941 as part of The Spitfire Fund in order to raise money for the supply of a real Spitfire to the Royal Air Force. Some models were clearly identified whereas others re-issued in 1945 had generic names such as Heavy Bomber (66a) and Two Seater Fighter (66c). The reason for this is not clear and it may have been that these were not true representations of particular aircraft types, but there were rumours that some models of aircraft and ships were disguised so that enemy agents would not be able to recognise allied aircraft and shipping from the Dinky Toys models. This was of particular importance in the production of French Dinky models due to the political friction in Europe before the war and the fact that France was occupied by the Axis forces during hostilities. These theories do not stand as the models with generic names were issued in 1945 and at that time there was no enemy any more, the allies had dealt with them. (Dinky Toys Encyclopaedia).|$|R

Potential uses for robust superhydrophobic coatings include antifouling applications such as <b>aeroplane</b> wings, <b>ship</b> hulls, offshore wind turbine blades, or the above-deck structures on ice breaker vessels. Several fabrication techniques have been reported for preparing inorganic superhydrophobic surfaces, but existing coatings either lack the necessary robustness for engineering applications and/or their deposition methods are not suitable for industrial scale-up. In this work, the industrially established HVOF coating process was adapted to use a liquid suspension of commercially available nano-particles (Titania — TiO 2, and hexagonal boron nitride — h-BN) as feedstock to produce nanostructured suspension HVOF TiO 2 /h-BN coatings {{for the first time}} on stainless steel. Results indicate that agglomerates in the nano-feedstock can be dispersed by h-BN due to poor mutual wettability between h-BN and molten TiO 2. It also inhibits the anatase-to-rutile transformation of TiO 2 during coating deposition by inhibiting sintering of TiO 2 in the HVOF flame. The resultant coating becomes superhydrophobic when the addition of h-BN reaches 10 wt. % due to the presence of hierarchical nano-texture on the surface. The superhydrophobicity (contact angle of 163 - 170 º) is maintained over a long period of time (> 13 months, test still ongoing) and remains stable after exposure to light and tape test. A potential route for industrial preparation of robust water-repellent coatings is therefore highlighted by the study...|$|R

Another major work in the field of three-dimensional turbulent boundary layers was published just after the Second World War by Kuethe [2], who investigated the boundary layer of a yawed wing. In the fifties, the number of investigations published was fairly limited and as late as in 1960 only 15 different experiments were reported. However, an increasing interest in the field of three-dimensional flows was initiated in the sixties, {{and at the end of}} the decade, 1969, Bradshaw and Terrel [3] reported the first investigations in which the Reynolds stresses were determined. The objectives of the present paper is to describe different hot-wire techniques available for the measurement of three dimensional turbulence flow fields, and to form a base from which the most suitable method for a certain flow case could be chosen...|$|R
