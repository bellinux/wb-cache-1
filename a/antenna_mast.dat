5|$|In {{the final}} quarter of 2006, Shelbourne Development issued two {{separate}} press releases regarding the construction and design of the spire. A November 2006 press release stated that construction of the Chicago Spire would begin in June 2007. In early December 2006, Shelbourne Development issued another press release stating that {{the design of the}} building had been revised. This included the removal of the hotel and the <b>antenna</b> <b>mast,</b> making the building consist solely of condominium units. The design change altered the twist to be consolidated towards the base of the building, which was also wider than the original plan. Additionally, the spire no longer tapered at the top, resulting in an increase in floor space and overall floor count. The revision also removed the separate parking structure from the original plan, instead incorporating underground parking into the spire itself. This first major redesign of the Chicago Spire was criticized by architectural critics and city officials.|$|E
5|$|The Chicago Spire was a supertall {{skyscraper}} {{project at}} 400 N. Lake Shore Drive in Chicago, Illinois that failed financially after beginning construction. When originally proposed as the Fordham Spire in July 2005, the design had 116 stories {{and would have}} included a hotel and condominiums and been topped with a broadcast <b>antenna</b> <b>mast.</b> The design was by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, and Chicago developer Christopher T. Carley of the Fordham Company was spearheading the project. On 16 March 2006, the initial design of the building passed unanimously during that day's meeting of the Chicago Plan Commission. A court ruling on 4 November 2014 brought to a close the original development plan and the extended litigation over the nine-year-old project; developer Garrett Kelleher signed over the property location to the project's biggest creditor, Related Midwest, who announced {{that they would not}} build the Spire.|$|E

25|$|The Empire State Building, {{the first}} {{building}} {{to have more}} than 100 floors (it has 102), was completed the following year. It was designed by Shreve, Lamb and Harmon in the contemporary Art Deco style. The tower takes its name from the nickname of New York State. Upon its completion in 1931 at 1,250feet (381m), it took the top spot as tallest building, and towered above all other buildings until 1972. The <b>antenna</b> <b>mast</b> added in 1951 brought pinnacle height to 1,472feet (449m), lowered in 1984 to 1,454feet (443m).|$|E

Sub-versions are the K1 and K2 models with two R-123 (or R-123M) and used at company and battalion level respectively. They carry five fewer rounds {{for the main}} gun than the standard tanks. The regiment commander's K3 is equipped with an R-130M, an R-123M, a 10-metre <b>antenna</b> <b>mast</b> and an AB-1-P/30 generator {{at the expense of}} twelve 100mm rounds. Early models had the R-113 and R-112 sets instead of the R-123 and R-130, the upgraded M series is fitted with R-173 and R-143T2 sets respectively.|$|E
25|$|The most {{recognizable}} external change {{was the use}} of the three-panel Erla-Haube clear-view canopy, which filled the entire canopy length behind the four-panel windscreen unit, which eliminated the older, rear fixed canopy section. Internal changes included inheriting the new 2,000W generator and the DB 605 D-2 engine of the 109K. Apart from the standardised streamlined engine cowlings, G-10s with the DB605 D-2 were equipped as standard with the MW-50 booster system (DB 605DM, later 605DB) and had a larger Fo 987 oil cooler housed in a deeper fairing. Also, because of the engine's enlarged crankcase and the oil return lines which ran in front of it, these G-10s had small blister fairings incorporated into the lower engine cowlings, forward of and below the exhaust stacks. The radio <b>antenna</b> <b>mast</b> was also removed from atop the rear fuselage turtledeck, and replaced with {{what appears to be the}} swept-back antenna from the Me 163B Komet rocket fighter, but oriented in reverse from the rocket fighter's mount, in being swept forward instead from its port wing leading edge underside mount on the G-10 subtype.|$|E
