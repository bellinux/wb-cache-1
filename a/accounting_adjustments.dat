40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss the impact of current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment</b> on the {{tradable}} and nontradable sector in member countries of currency union - Euro zone. The current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment</b> associated with the adjustment of the net export's deficit caused by the drop in the domestic absorption evokes the increase in the relative price of the nontradable sector. The paper discusses this hypothesis within framework of the Portuguese current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment,</b> which is the result of European financial integration in catching-up countries. The common monetary policy and common currency cannot offset the negative impact of nontradable price increase within the internal expenditure switching effect and also can not support exporters within the external expenditure effect [...] The Portuguese current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment</b> was not followed by the currency depreciation and the tradable price increase. The cost of the currency asymmetric response were born by the tradable mark-up decrease, the falling decrease in nontradable wages and employment and finally by the nontradable mark-up and employment decrease. current account, common currency, tradable sector, nontradable sector...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{carries out}} a {{quantitative}} comparison of accounting differences between Italian reporting practice and United States generally agreed accounting principles (US GAAP) {{with the purpose}} of examining how alternative accounting treatments impact on the level of conservatism. The analysis investigates the <b>accounting</b> <b>adjustments</b> applied to net income and shareholders’ equity as included in the Form 20 -F reconciliation reported by Italian firms to the Security Exchange Commission (SEC). The methodology first introduced by Gray (1980) is adapted to recognize a multi-period dimension of the accounting choice. In particular, by focussing on the timing of such adjustments – that is their attitude to reverse or become permanent over time – we develop hypotheses based on the interaction of three factors: clean vs dirty-surplus accounting, recurring vs non-recurring operations, long-term vs short-term assets and liabilities. The results are consistent with our general thesis that the level of conservatism is fundamentally measured by the prevailing directional effect of permanent <b>accounting</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Such adjustments arise and intensify when the accounting differences relate to long-term assets and liabilities that are recurring. Amongst them those stemming from the violation of the clean surplus relation are the most controversial for they generate an opposite permanent effect in the measurement of both net assets and earnings...|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Congress changed the law governing the use of appropriation accounts in 1990 because it found that the Department of Defense (DOD) may have spent {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars for purposes that Congress had not approved. The 1990 law provided that, 5 years after the expiration of the period of availability of a fixed-term appropriation, the appropriation account be closed and all remaining balances canceled. After closing, the appropriation account could no longer be used for obligations or expenditures for any purpose. DOD has started the process of correcting the illegal or improper closed <b>account</b> <b>adjustments</b> made during fiscal year 2000. However, this will require substantial effort and, according to DOD, estimates will not be complete before the end of fiscal year 2002. DOD had upgraded its system control features by the end of fiscal year 2001 to preclude many of the wholesale adjustments that GAO had previously identified. Because its system enhancements were done in stages, including some near the end of fiscal year 2001, DOD continued to make large amounts of illegal and otherwise improper closed <b>account</b> <b>adjustments</b> during the year. However, given the intensity of staff efforts to address these issues, it did not expect to complete the correct accounting for transactions found to be in error until September 2004. A lack of fundamental controls and management oversight over the closed accounts was the primary reason DOD was making so many closed <b>account</b> <b>adjustments.</b> DOD's action to resolve its problems with closed <b>account</b> <b>adjustments</b> is beginning to produce positive short-term results. However, if DOD fails to sustain these positive results, Congress could require DOD to validate and report to the Congress all closed <b>account</b> <b>adjustments.</b> ...|$|R

A sufficiently strong response to net foreign assets is also a condition for external sustainability.

40|$|In this paper, a {{standard}} model of international transfer is augmented by {{the introduction of}} firm heterogeneity. The increase in aggregate exports in response to the transfer reflects extensive and intensive adjustments, as the sales of new exporting firms (extensive margin) contribute to the current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment</b> along with the sales of existing exporting firms (intensive margin). The relative size of the intensive and extensive margins of the adjustment is determined by the size dispersion of firms. The model calibrated to the observed distribution of firm sizes shows that the intensive margin is the predominant channel of the current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The dampening effect of the extensive margin has therefore very little impact on the exchange rate adjustment. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{episodes of}} current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment</b> in industrial countries {{over the past}} 30 years. We find that they were typically associated with a sizeable slowdown in domestic growth and a large exchange rate depreciation. There was no discernable change {{in the nature of}} capital flows in the period just prior to an adjustment, {{with the possible exception of}} non-residents' holdings of currency and deposits. This suggests that a current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment</b> may be an endogenous event - responding to the resolution of domestic imbalances - rather than an exogenous event where the size of the current account deficit itself precipitates the adjustment in the domestic economy and the exchange rate. Econometric evidence suggests that global developments trigger the adjustment, possibly because they trigger the unwinding of the domestic imbalances. We find that the bulk of the ex post adjustment of the financial account was in private sector flows, primarily on the part of foreign investors. Finally, we document some notable differences in the adjustment of the current account in the United States in 1987 compared with that observed in the other episodes.

These performance metrics have been shown to generate desirable managerial incentives when investment decisions are delegated. This paper further attests to the robustness of these measures by extending the result to a sequential adverse selection model with an inherent real option (an option to abandon). In other words, as long as the residual income measures are judiciously constructed, neither private information nor the requirement to selectively exercise an option derails their use in this setting. sequential capital budgeting, residual income, <b>accounting</b> <b>adjustments,</b> sequential adverse selection problem...|$|E

30|$|In {{this paper}} I {{consider}} {{the impact of}} a noisy indicator regarding a manager’s manipulative behavior on optimal effort incentives and the extent of earnings management. The analysis in this paper extends a two-task, single performance measure LEN model by including a binary random variable. I show that contracting on the noisy indicator variable is not always useful. More specifically, the principal uses the indicator variable to prevent earnings management only under conditions where manipulative behavior is not excessive. Thus, under conditions of excessive earnings management, <b>accounting</b> <b>adjustments</b> that yield a more congruent overall performance measure can be more effective than an appraisal of the existence of earnings management to mitigate the earnings management problem.|$|E
40|$|Much {{has been}} written about {{prospects}} for U. S. current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment,</b> including the possibility of what is sometimes referred to as a "disorderly correction": a sharp fall in the exchange rate that boosts interest rates, depresses stock prices, and weakens economic activity. This paper assesses some of the empirical evidence bearing on the likelihood of the disorderly correction scenario, drawing on the experience of previous current <b>account</b> <b>adjustments</b> in industrial economies. We examined the paths of key economic performance indicators before, during, and after the onset of adjustment, building on the analysis of Freund (2000). We found little evidence among past adjustment episodes of the features highlighted by the disorderly correction hypothesis. Although some episodes in our sample experienced significant shortfalls in GDP growth after the onset of adjustment, these shortfalls were not associated with significant and sustained depreciations of real exchange rates, increases in real interest rates, or declines in real stock prices. By contrast, it was among the episodes where GDP growth picked up during adjustment that the most substantial depreciations of real exchange rates occurred. These findings do not preclude the possibility that future current <b>account</b> <b>adjustments</b> could be disruptive, but they weaken the historical basis for predicting such an outcome.

First, it emphasizes the dynamics of current <b>account</b> <b>adjustment,</b> going beyond computations of the real depreciation required to achieve sustainability. The analysis shows that, even if foreigners’ net demand for U. S. assets continues to increase significantly, the current account deficit is likely to fall steeply in the not too distant future. Second, the paper uses international evidence to explore the likelihood of an abrupt decline in capital flows into the United States. Third, it {{analyzes the}} international evidence on current account reversals, to investigate the potential consequences of a sudden stop of capital inflows. This analysis suggests that adjustment of the U. S. external accounts is likely to result in a significant reduction in growth. macroeconomics, U. S.

We study the characteristics of such current <b>account</b> <b>adjustments,</b> particularly whether they are executed through export growth or import contraction. We find significant differences between Asia and Latin America, with Asian countries adjusting through export growth and Latin America through import contraction. When looking at the fundamentals that explain such dissimilar behavior, we conclude that these differences are attributable to differences in the degree of openness and financial dollarization with the size of the financial sector being irrelevant. We argue that the analysis allows the conclusion that "pesified" financial sectors that insulate the domestic financial sector from exchange rate movements are better suited to deal with unstable international financial markets...|$|R
