6000|$|After Davy {{had cried}} a great deal, and wished very often {{that he had}} not been so {{determined}} to leave home, he dried his eyes and began to take great interest in the curious things he saw around him. What surprised him most of all was, that although he actually was at sea, he could not see the sea at all! This was because the sides of the ship, which are called [...] "bulwarks," [...] were so high that they quite prevented the little boy from seeing overboard. Davy soon found an opening in the bulwarks, however, which his friend Ben called the [...] "gang-way," [...] through which he could see the water and the ships and boats that were sailing there. And when he mounted the high part of the deck in front of the ship, which is called the [...] "forecastle," [...] or when he went upon the high deck at the stern of the ship, which is called the [...] "poop," [...] then he could see all round. And what a wonderful and new sight it was to Davy! His cottage was gone! The beach, and the pier where the nets used to hang, were gone. The trees and fields were all gone, and there was nothing but sea, sea, sea, all round, so that the Fair Nancy seemed the only solid thing in the whole wide world! But poor Davy did not look or wonder long at this, for the breeze freshened, and the waves rose, and the ship plunged, and Davy felt very queer about the stomach! There is a man in every ship called the [...] "steward," [...] and everybody loves that man, because he goes about from morning till night trying to do people good and to make them happy. He looks <b>after</b> breakfasts, <b>dinners,</b> <b>teas,</b> and suppers. He answers every one who calls, and gets for everybody anything that they want. He is never ill, never in a hurry, never in a bad temper; in fact, he is a very charming man.|$|R
