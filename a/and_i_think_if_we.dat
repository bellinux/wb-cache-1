60|$|The Irish {{question}} {{at the present time}} occupies a vastly different position to what it did in the year 1886. Ever since 1880 the attention of Parliament has been devoted constantly to Ireland, and the attention of Parliament, when devoted constantly to one object, is rarely fruitless. The twenty-five years that have passed have seen great changes in Ireland. We have seen a great scheme of local government, which Lord Salisbury said would be more disastrous than Home Rule itself, actually put into force. We have seen the scheme of land purchase, which in the year 1886 did more to injure the Home Rule Bill than anything else, actually carried, not indeed to a complete conclusion, but carried into practical effect by a Unionist Administration. These are great events; and their consequences, I think, ought to encourage us to move forward, and not to move back. They have produced results in Ireland which are beneficent, and the Irish question no longer presents itself in the tragic guise of the early eighties. They have produced an effect on Great Britain too. All over our country people have seen Bills which they were told beforehand would be ruinous to the unity and integrity of the United Kingdom--Land Bills and Local Government Bills--passed into law; and so far from the dire consequences which were apprehended from these measures, they have found--you here have found--that great good has resulted from that legislation. Many people are encouraged by what has taken place to make a step forward in the future; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> need to look for any further encouragement, we should find it in the great and undisputed triumph which, under the mercy of Heaven, has attended our policy in South Africa, and has resulted in bringing into the circle of the British Empire a strong and martial race, which might easily have been estranged for ever.|$|E
6000|$|Learn {{that line}} by heart and act, at all events {{for some time}} to come, upon Velasquez' opinion in that matter. Titian is much the safest master for you. Raphael's power, such as it {{characters}} in his mind; it is [...] "Raphaelesque," [...] properly so called; but Titian's power is simply the power of doing right. Whatever came before Titian, he did wholly as it ought to be done. Do not suppose that now in recommending Titian to you so strongly, and speaking of nobody else to-night, I am retreating in anywise from what some of you may perhaps recollect in my works, the enthusiasm with which I have always spoken of another Venetian painter. There are three Venetians who are never separated in my mind--Titian, Veronese, and Tintoret. They all have their own unequalled gifts, and Tintoret especially has imagination and depth of soul which I think renders him indisputably the greatest man; but, equally indisputably, Titian is the greatest painter; and therefore the greatest painter who ever lived. You may be led wrong by Tintoret [Footnote: See Appendix I.--"Right and Wrong."] in many respects, wrong by Raphael in more; all that you learn from Titian will be right. Then, with Titian, take Leonardo, Rembrandt, and Albert Dürer. I name those three masters for this reason: Leonardo has powers of subtle drawing which are peculiarly applicable in many ways to the drawing of fine ornament, and are very useful for all students. Rembrandt and Dürer are the only men whose actual work of hand you can have to look at; you can have Rembrandt's etchings, or Dürer's engravings actually hung in your schools; and it is a main point for the student to see the real thing, and avoid judging of masters at second-hand. As, however, in obeying this principle, you cannot often have opportunities of studying Venetian painting, it is desirable that you should have a useful standard of colour, and I think it is possible for you to obtain this. I cannot, indeed, without entering upon ground which might involve the hurting the feelings of living artists, state exactly what I believe to be the relative position of various painters in England at present with respect to power of colour. But I may say this, that in the peculiar gifts of colour which will be useful to you as students, there are only {{one or two of the}} pre-Raphaelites, and William Hunt, of the old Water Colour Society, who would be safe guides for you: and as quite a safe guide, there is nobody but William Hunt, because the pre-Raphaelites are all more or less affected by enthusiasm and by various morbid conditions of intellect and temper; but old William Hunt--I am sorry to say [...] "old," [...] but I say it in a loving way, for every year that has added to his life has added also to his skill--William Hunt is as right as the Venetians, as far as he goes, and what is more, nearly as inimitable as they. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> manage to put in the principal schools of England a little bit of Hunt's work, and make that somewhat of a standard of colour, that we can apply his principles of colouring to subjects of all kinds. Until you have had a work of his long near you; nay, unless you have been labouring at it, and trying to copy it, you do not know the thoroughly grand qualities that are concentrated in it. Simplicity, and intensity, both of the highest character;-- simplicity of aim, and intensity of power and success, are involved in that man's unpretending labour.|$|E

5000|$|Pisani {{has been}} a vocal {{advocate}} of the harm reduction approach to addressing HIV/AIDS, supporting needle exchange programmes, making condoms widely available, and giving aid to countries that have policies of legalized prostitution. She outlined these views in her book, subsequent articles, interviews, and her 2010 TED Talk. She strongly criticized the regulations imposed by USAID ambassador Randall Tobias, in particular, those forbidding aid recipients from accepting, tolerating, or legalizing prostitution, or promothing anything but abstinence, arguing that organizations of prostitutes are effective at educating those most at risk, and that abstinence-only sex education has been demonstrated to fail in rigorous scientific studies. In addition, she criticized the Catholic Church's prohibition on condom use {{as a means to}} prevent the spread of HIV. In an interview with The Guardian, she said [...] "I don't think it's evil to have anal sex with 16 people in a weekend without condoms. I just think if you do that there's a high likelihood you're going to get infected. That's all. It's cause and effect. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can prevent a fatal disease, we should. I don't get how it's OK to keep someone alive once they're sick - but not OK to stop them getting sick. I just don't get that." [...] In an article for The Guardian the following year, she asked [...] "why can't we extend our compassion to those who are not yet infected, and provide them with all the information and tools they need to stay uninfected? Whether the pope likes it or not, those tools include condoms. In her TED Talk, she called the position [...] "clearly irrational" [...] In addition, she elaborated her position on needle-exchange programmes, citing several studies that supported their effectiveness, and noting that Margaret Thatcher was the first major public figure to lend support to it. She concluded her talk by saying that the audience there, and anyone viewing the talk on the web, [...] "has a duty to demand of their politicians that we make policy based on scientific evidence, and on common sense." ...|$|E

40|$|Eat healthy, {{stay healthy}} Suggested introduction: We often {{hear about the}} {{importance}} of having a balanced diet, but what does this mean in practice? To answer that question, a nutritionist may talk about the six basic food groups, and the need to eat the right amount of food from each group on a daily basis. For three of the groups - cereals, fruit, and vegetables - we are encouraged to eat larger amounts. For the other three groups - meat and other protein sources, fats and oils, and dairy products - we should eat smaller amounts - although they are still {{a very important part of}} a healthy diet. However, this notion of a healthy diet is not widely understood, and in many countries will conflict, sometimes with traditional diets, and sometimes simply with what foods are available. This can be particularly true when a country is hit by a natural disaster. Susanna Thorp found out more about the difficulty of achieving a balanced diet at a recent conference on food and nutrition security in Belize. Speaking first to Betty Findlay, Executive Secretary for the Food and Nutrition Council in Grenada and Lydia Brown, a nutritionist at the Grenadian Ministry of Health, she asked how difficult it was for people in that country to achieve a healthy, balanced diet. IN:		?At this point in time after Hurricane Ivan [...] ? OUT:		? we are going to lose everything. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 37 ? Back announcement: Kalawatie Gookol from Trinidad and Tobago stressing the importance of healthy eating for a healthy nation. Transcript Findlay	At this point in time after Hurricane Ivan it is quite a challenge because the majority of the agricultural sector has been destroyed. Our ability to provide food for our people, and not only food, but food that will provide the needed nutrients for improved health, that is the challenge we have now. Also in regard to that because so many trees have fallen the problem of clearing the land is posing a big, big challenge. And then, being able to source plants, seedlings and plant, those are some big challenges for us at this time. Thorp	So there are two separate issues, there is the food availability and accessibility and then also you have got then the nutritional side of things as well. Lydia how do you see that as the main problems there? Brown	Well it comes back to us putting agriculture and nutrition together because what we have seen is a vast increase in the level of uncontrolled diabetes and uncontrolled hypertension. Because people especially after the hurricane had to resort to a lot of processed foods and canned goods and things that are not usually promoted for these disease states. And so we have seen a lot of hospitalisations, a lot of illnesses coming about, I think, as an after effect of that incident. NARR	With poor diet leading to high rates of illness in Grenada, I asked Lydia what could be done to promote healthy eating. Brown	Well I think that behaviour change is a major part of wellness. And in the Caribbean we have a mindset that this is the way we did things 20 - 50 years ago and this is the way my grandmother did it and this is the way I?m going to do it. And so I think it?s really going to take us a few years to come, but it has to be chronic education. Chronic education and us giving the same message. The same message coming from all the professional people, including the doctors. Because that is where a lot of misinformation, especially on nutrition comes from, and Caribbean people, especially people in Grenada, they listen to the doctor. Whatever the doctor says is gospel. So it is important for us as nutrition professionals to educate not only the people but to educate other professionals so that they are giving the same message that we are giving. And hopefully in a few years from now, we will be able to see a reduction in some of the chronic diseases and some of the low birth weights and things like that. NARR	Kay Gookol is the Chief Nutritionist for the Ministry of Health in Trinidad and Tobago. She also feels that better communication about healthy eating is essential, but achieving this will require a joint effort by several government departments. Gookol	Personally I feel that a lot of work needs to be done in nutrition. Because if you go out into the rural areas in Trinidad and Tobago people know very little. And we need a lot more teaching of people, a lot more educational programmes to be held throughout the country, both Trinidad and Tobago. Because people hardly really know what are the basic six food groups and how to eat a well balanced meal to help them on a daily basis. And the big thing today is eat healthy and stay healthy. So we need to promote that and if we can?t we are losing the whole thing. Thorp	Do you think that agriculture and nutrition are integrated enough or do you think there is a lot more? Gookol	No, no I do not think we are integrated enough. I think also we should incorporate the Ministry of Education because within the Ministry of Education we have the school nutrition programmes, and children should be taught from pre-kindergarten level to eat healthy. So they need to be incorporated, the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Health. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> do that and we try to promote it, we will be able to help a lot more. NARR	But, I asked her, what can nutrition experts like herself do in order to have an impact on policy makers and achieve significant change at a national level? Gookol	The thing is it goes right back; are we meeting the people that we should meet to get all these things going? We can put everything in black and white on paper there and if we don?t meet the people at that level we are losing everything. And I think that is what is happening, we are losing the nation. Because if you look our children?s eating habits, it is really, really bad. And if we don?t have a healthy nation we are going to lose everything. End of track.
