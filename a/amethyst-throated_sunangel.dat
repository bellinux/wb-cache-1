5000|$|Longuemare's sunangel (Heliangelus clarisse) is a hummingbird {{found in}} Venezuela and northeastern Colombia. [...] It {{is closely related}} to the <b>amethyst-throated</b> <b>sunangel,</b> and species limits in this complex are unclear.

50|$|In the Handbook of the Birds of the World, Longuemare's sunangel {{is one of}} {{the four}} {{subspecies}} of the <b>amethyst-throated</b> sunangel: Longuemare's <b>sunangel,</b> H. c. clarisse in the Colombian Andes from Norte de Santander to the latitude of Bogotá; violiceps in the Sierra de Perijá (only in Zulia in Venezuela); H. c. verdiscutus in southeastern Norte de Santander, Colombia, and southern Táchira, Venezuela; and Mérida sunangel, H. c. spencei isolated in Mérida, Venezuela. The IOC continues to recognize both the Merida sunangel and Longuemare's sunangel..|$|R
50|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of this species}} is uncertain. The subspecies spencei is recognised by the IOC as a full species, the Mérida sunangel, H. spencei (Bourcier 1847), but other authorities lump it with Longuemare's sunangel, H. clarisse of Colombia and Venezuela or consider both spencei and clarisse as subspecies of <b>amethyst-throated</b> <b>sunangel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Originally spencei was {{described}} as a separate species and the other three species were considered subspecies of the <b>amethyst-throated</b> <b>sunangel,</b> whose undoubted populations live in Ecuador and Peru. Other arrangements have been suggested, but most authorities lump all of these groups with the amethyst-throated. A review by the American Ornithologists' Union's South American Check-list Committee stated that the situation is unclear and any decision is arbitrary until more data are available. Some taxonomic authorities, including the IOC, continue to split both the Merida sunangel and Longuemare's sunangel.|$|E
