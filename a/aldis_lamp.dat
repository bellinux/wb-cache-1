500|$|Shortly after arrival, she was {{involved}} in the final Exocet raid against the aircraft carrier [...] In the early hours of 6 June, Cardiff shot down a friendly Army Air Corps Gazelle helicopter (no.XX377 of 656 Squadron), in the belief it was a low flying enemy C-130 Hercules. All four on board were killed, the factors contributing to the accident were a poor level of communication between the army and navy, and the helicopter's [...] "Identification Friend or Foe" [...] transmitter had been turned off due to it interfering with other equipment. However a board of inquiry recommended that neither negligence nor blame should be attributed to any individual and that no action should be taken against any individual. The number [...] "205" [...] was later painted at the crash site (...) as a memorial, the significance being that two of the helicopter's passengers were from 205Signal Squadron. Approximately an hour after the shoot down, Cardiff spotted four landing craft carrying troops from the 2ndBattalion, Scots Guards. Having been told there were no other British forces in the area, Cardiff's crew assumed they were Argentine, and fired illuminating star shells over them in preparation to attack. When the Guards saw the star shells and realised Cardiffs intentions, the officer in charge of the landing craft, Major Ewen Southby-Tailyour, moved them to shallow water in an attempt to outrun her. Cardiff, still closing on the craft, signalled to them a single word [...] "friend" [...] via <b>Aldis</b> <b>lamp,</b> Southby-Tailyour responded with [...] "to which side". At this point Cardiff [...] "left them alone", neither attacking or assisting them, nevertheless another [...] "blue on blue" [...] incident was avoided.|$|E
2500|$|Morse code can be {{transmitted}} {{in a number of}} ways: originally as electrical pulses along a telegraph wire, but also as an audio tone, a radio signal with short and long tones, or as a mechanical, audible, or visual signal (e.g. a flashing light) using devices like an <b>Aldis</b> <b>lamp</b> or a heliograph, a common flashlight, or even a car horn. [...] Some mine rescues have used pulling on a rope - a short pull for a dot and a long pull for a dash.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 October 1943, [...] {{south of}} Ireland, on passage from Port Talbot to Lisbon with a cargo of coal, the Kerlogue was circled by an RAAF Sunderland flying boat. [...] Three hours later, she was {{attacked}} by two initially unidentified aircraft, later found to have been Mosquito fighters of No. 307 Polish Night Fighter Squadron. For twenty minutes they repeatedly dived on the Kerlogue firing their cannons. [...] Another RAAF Sunderland came by at six in the evening. By <b>Aldis</b> <b>lamp,</b> the Kerlogue requested an escort and medical assistance. [...] The Sunderland replied that help could not be given.|$|E
5000|$|The {{heyday of}} the {{heliograph}} was probably the Second Boer War in South Africa, where it was much used by both the British and the Boers. [...] The terrain and climate, {{as well as the}} nature of the campaign, made heliography a logical choice. For night communications, the British used some large <b>Aldis</b> <b>lamps,</b> brought inland on railroad cars, and equipped with leaf-type shutters for keying a beam of light into dots and dashes. During {{the early stages of the}} war, the British garrisons were besieged in Kimberley, Ladysmith, and Mafeking. With land telegraph lines cut, the only contact with the outside world was via light-beam communication, helio by day, and <b>Aldis</b> <b>lamps</b> at night.|$|R
5000|$|The {{findings}} were forwarded to the Commander in Chief, Grand Fleet, Admiral David Beatty, who remarked that {{the incident was}} [...] "...one of those that are inseparable from war", but deplored the delay in introducing improved signalling facilities on submarines, particularly the substitution of the slow, unreliable and cumbersome cruiser arc <b>lamp</b> with <b>Aldis</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Signal <b>lamps</b> (such as <b>Aldis</b> <b>lamps),</b> are visual {{signaling}} devices for optical communication (typically using Morse code).

2500|$|Just on 9:30pm, Port Kembla harbour {{signalman}} Arthur Tremble {{spotted a}} vessel at sea to the north-east of the harbour {{and attempted to}} make contact with an <b>Aldis</b> <b>lamp.</b> The vessel answered but its signals were unable to be deciphered, most likely due to the roughness of the conditions. For the next 20 minutes Tremble maintained watch on the vessel with binoculars as it slowly closed on Port Kembla. At 9:50pm Tremble again requested identification, this time receiving the reply [...] "Bombo" [...] followed by [...] "sheltering". Tremble confirmed receipt and the Bombo acknowledged, at which time the signalman recorded the events in his log. When he attempted to re-locate the vessel several minutes later he was unsuccessful, and concluded that the Bombo had turned into the small harbour at Wollongong just to the north.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} 1917, about 300 DH.6s were {{transferred}} to the RNAS for anti-submarine patrols. While far from ideal for this work, the type proved surprisingly [...] "seaworthy", being known to float {{for as long as}} ten hours after ditching. On operations, the underpowered trainer could not carry both an observer and weaponry. The majority of patrols were flown solo, allowing a token bomb load and a lightweight radio installation to be carried, although convoy escort missions generally carried an observer who could communicate with ships using an <b>Aldis</b> <b>lamp.</b> The [...] "built in" [...] instability designed to keep a student pilot alert proved tiring for pilots on long patrols over water, and experimental changes were made in mid-1918 to improve stability.

50|$|Aircraft pilots {{often use}} visual {{approach}} slope indicator (VASI) projected light systems to land safely, especially at night. Military aircraft landing on {{an aircraft carrier}} use a similar system to land correctly on a carrier deck. The coloured light system communicates the aircraft's height relative to a standard landing glideslope. As well, airport control towers still use <b>Aldis</b> <b>lamps</b> to transmit instructions to aircraft whose radios have failed.|$|R
5|$|The American {{airborne}} landings {{began with}} the arrival of pathfinders at 00:15. Navigation was difficult because of a bank of thick cloud, and as a result only one of the five paratrooper drop zones was accurately marked with radar signals and <b>Aldis</b> <b>lamps.</b> Paratroopers of the US 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, numbering over 13,000 men, were delivered by Douglas C-47 Skytrains of the IX Troop Carrier Command.

Perry recalls: [...] "Everyone knew through hard experience that the Air Corps needed help to drop us on the correct drop zone. We organized the Scout Company for this purpose. This was later made into a Scout Platoon under my command, consisting of 10 enlisted and myself.

2500|$|The Troop Carrier Command {{moved from}} Tunisia to Sicily in early September and Williams opened his {{headquarters}} at Licata. Two airborne operations were planned. GIANT I was an airborne {{assault on the}} Volturno River crossing. It was cancelled as the risks to both paratroops and aircraft were considered too great. GIANT II was an airborne assault on Rome area. Williams planned parachute drops on airfields at Poligono di Furbara and Cerveteri, northwest of the city. It too was cancelled amid doubts {{as to whether the}} Italian Rome garrison could hold the area. However, in response to the deteriorating situation in the Battle of Salerno, Lieutenant General Mark Clark called for an emergency mission to bring the 82nd Airborne Division. The 51st and 52nd Troop Carrier Wings were given only hours to prepare but Williams was able to improvise by using the plans for GIANT I. This time extraordinary measures were taken to silence Allied anti-aircraft guns afloat and ashore. Three pathfinder aircraft led the way, dropping fifty paratroops equipped with Rebecca/Eureka and Krypton lamps precisely on the drop zone behind Allied lines. Most of the paratroops landed within [...] of the drop zone, and no troops or aircraft were lost. A second drop the following night was just as successful. This encouraged Allied commanders to attempt a battalion-sized drop behind enemy lines at Avellino the night after but the hilly terrain made it difficult for the pathfinders' <b>Aldis</b> <b>lamps</b> and radio transmitters and the drop was scattered.|$|R

While there was certainly a Signalman rating before World War II (the Signalman rating {{is one of the}} oldest in the Navy), a specialized Signalman rating was established shortly after the war. Then, Signalmen were identified by the symbol of two crossed semaphore flags on the left sleeve of the uniform, integrated with their rank insignia. Signalmen were responsible for transmitting, receiving, encoding, decoding, and distributing messages obtained via the visual transmission systems of flag semaphore, visual morse code, and flaghoist signalling. The U.S. Navy disestablished the rating of Signalman in late 2003, reassigning visual communications duties to the Quartermaster rating. Signalmen were either absorbed into the Quartermaster rating, or allowed to switch to other job fields in the Navy. Many chose the Master-at-Arms rating, which expanded dramatically to meet the needs of the Navy in the War on Terror.|$|E

Too fast with one combination of engines and too slow with the other, the MTB was put onto tow until the convoy reached St. Nazaire. The ships crossed 400 mi of open sea and were three miles (5 km) up the Loire estuary before the Germans opened fire. Campbeltown, which was flying the German ensign, immediately replied in German by Morse and <b>Aldis</b> <b>lamp,</b> and the enemy batteries held their fire, allowing Campbeltown to move closer to the docks. At 1.27 am and closing on the gate, Campbeltown replaced the German flag and hauled up the British ensign. Under intense fire Campbeltown cut through the torpedo net and rammed the dock gates at 1.34. Wynn, who had been cast off from Campbeltown, was ordered to fire his two torpedoes at his secondary target, the gate at the old entrance. Wynn reported to Commander Ryder and was congratulated on his success with a swift drink from a flask.|$|E
