40|$|Abstract: The {{design of}} a {{wireless}} LPG leakage monitoring system is proposed for home safety. This system detects the leakage of the LPG and alerts the consumer about the leak by SMS and as an emergency measure the system will turnoff the power supply, while <b>activating</b> <b>the</b> <b>alarm.</b> <b>The</b> additional advantage {{of the system is}} that it continuously monitors the level of the LPG present in the cylinder using load sensor and if the gas level reaches below the threshold limit of gas around 2 kg so that the user can replace the old cylinder with new in time and automatically books the cylinder using a GSM module. The device ensures safety and prevents suffocation and explosion due to gas leakage. This project is implemented using ARM 7 processor and simulated using keil software...|$|R

50|$|An {{alarm clock}} (or {{sometimes}} just an alarm) is a clock {{that is designed}} to alert an individual or group of individuals at specified time. The primary function of these clocks is to awaken people from their night's sleep or short naps; they are sometimes used for other reminders as well. Most use sound; some use light or vibration. Some have sensors to identify when a person is in a light stage of sleep, in order to avoid waking someone who is deeply asleep, which causes tiredness, even if the person has had adequate sleep. To stop the sound or light, a button or handle on the clock is pressed; most clocks automatically stop <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> if left unattended long enough. A classic analog alarm clock has an extra hand or inset dial that is used to specify the time at which to <b>activate</b> <b>the</b> <b>alarm.</b> Alarm clocks are also found on mobile phones and watches.|$|R
50|$|A {{fire alarm}} pull station {{is an active}} fire {{protection}} device, usually wall-mounted, that, when activated, initiates an alarm on a fire alarm system. In its simplest form, <b>the</b> user <b>activates</b> <b>the</b> <b>alarm</b> by pulling <b>the</b> handle down, which completes a circuit and locks the handle in <b>the</b> <b>activated</b> position, sending an <b>alarm</b> to <b>the</b> fire <b>alarm</b> control panel. After operation, most fire alarm pull stations must be restored to the ready position using a special tool or key {{in order for the}} panel to be reset. Primitive manual stations, requiring only a single action or hand motion to activate, can be subject to unwanted activation by jarring or accidental contact. Early strategies to cope with this problem included requiring the operator to break a pane of glass to release an internal spring-operated mechanism. Manual pull stations that require two hand motions, such as lift up and pull down, or push in and pull down, have since replaced the break-glass and single-action models in many modern installations.|$|R
