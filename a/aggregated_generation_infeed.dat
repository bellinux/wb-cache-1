40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} method to {{establish}} the accurate parameters of stabilisers {{in the context of}} power systems with increasing penetration of Doubly Fed Induction Generators (DFIGs), Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) and Photovoltaic (PVs) using a hierarchical coordinated strategy and localised design. The performance of the tuned stabilisers is verified using modal analysis results and non-linear simulation. This thesis proposes that by using regulated stabilisers, the dynamic stability of a power system with large-scale Distributed Generation (DG) integration can be maintained. SmartParks have been proposed in published literature to support emergent electric vehicle charging. In practice, a SmartPark can be configured as an adjustable load, in charging mode, or a regulated generator, in a discharging mode using a voltage control strategy. In this thesis, damping torque analysis (DTA) has been used to investigate the impact on dynamic stability of the joint operation of SmartParks in power systems with conventional synchronous machines. The analysis reveals that in terms of the local damping ratio, optimal charging and local capacity is best considered during SmartPark design. According to a Phillips-Heffron model developed for a multi-machine system with SmartPark, active and reactive power stabiliser can be incorporated into the SmartPark control loops to improve the damping of the system.

A sophisticated algorithm using ac optimal power flow (OPF) is often unnecessarily detailed {{for the purpose of}} valuating such projects. Input parameters such as expected future generation mix is hard to guess and error prone. Therefore a simplified model of the underlying electricity system was chosen for this evaluation. The suggested method is based on a model that uses areaconstraints and <b>aggregated</b> <b>generation</b> in each area coupled with a double auction market model, based on the production costs of generators. A Discounted Cash Flow methodology is then used to estimate the value of this project. In different case studies the influence of various parameters on the value of the controllable device is determined. Typical parameters are: Investment costs, running costs, relocatability etc. Also the impact of transmission congestions on electricity prices, consumer, producer and society profit is studied...|$|R

In our model, energy storage devices are incorporated for not only inter-temporal energy arbitrage to reduce total generation cost, but also providing spinning reserve to share generators' burden. To solve this problem, {{we assume that the}} communication networks are strongly connected directed graphs and propose a fully distributed algorithm based on the ‘consensus-like’ iterative algorithm and the alternating direction method of multipliers.

40|$|The dawn {{of smart}} grid is posing new {{challenges}} to grid operation. The introduction of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) requires tough planning and advanced tools to efﬁciently manage the system at reasonable costs. Virtual Power Players (VPP) {{are used as}} means of <b>aggregating</b> <b>generation</b> and demand, which enable smaller producers using different generation technologies to be more competitive. This paper discusses {{the problem of the}} centralized Energy Resource Management (ERM), including several types of resources, such as Demand Response (DR), Electric Vehicles (EV) and Energy Storage Systems (ESS) from the VPP's perspective to maximize proﬁts. The complete formulation of this problem, which includes the network constraints, is represented with a complex large-scale mixed integer nonlinear problem. This paper focuses on deterministic and metaheuristics methods and proposes a new multi-dimensional signaling approach for population-based random search techniques. The new approach is tested with two networks with high penetration of DERs. The results show outstanding performance with the proposed multi-dimensional signaling and conﬁrm that standard metaheuristics are prone to fail in solving these kind of problems. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

For some DG technologies, like wind power and PV, another reason significantly limiting their participation in the electricity market trade is the inherent intermittency of power generation process which might result in a high risk of financial losses due to additional balancing needs. At the same time being connected together, DG and RES technologies can complement each other in balancing out the total operation result. Aggregations of distributed generators of different technological types ("DG clusters") lead to <b>aggregated</b> <b>generation</b> profiles.

40|$|The Weibull {{probability}} distribution {{has been widely}} applied to characterize wind speeds for wind energy resources. Wind power generation modeling is different, however, due in particular to power curve limitations, wind turbine control methods, and transmission system operation requirements.

Consequently, models based on one-Weibull component can provide poor characterizations for <b>aggregated</b> wind power <b>generation.</b> With this aim, the present paper focuses on discussing Weibull mixtures to characterize the probability density function (PDF) for <b>aggregated</b> wind power <b>generation.</b> PDFs of wind power data are firstly classified attending to hourly and seasonal patterns.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how uncertainty surrounding possible comprehensive regulatory restructuring affect the investment behavior of firms {{operating in the}} industry. We argue that such regulatory uncertainty can create a substantial option value that leads to firms delaying their investment decision in order to gather more information and assurances regarding future regulatory changes.

Using state-level, aggregate investment data, we find evidence {{that is consistent with}} the presence of substantial option value: a strong link between lesser <b>aggregate</b> <b>generation</b> investment and greater restructuring enactment uncertainty. Using data on firm-level generation investment decisions for a sample of major U.

Comparing estimates from this “real options ” based model with the corresponding estimates from two alternative models, expected Net Present Value (NPV) and Forward-Looking (FWL), we show that accounting for the option value can lead to different inferences regarding the impact of regulatory restructuring on IPP generation investment...|$|R

40|$|For the {{purposes}} of understanding the impacts on the electricity network, estimates of hourly <b>aggregate</b> wind power <b>generation</b> for a region are required. However, the availability of wind production data for the UK is limited, and studies often rely on measured wind speeds from a network of meteorological (met) stations. Another option is to use historical wind speeds from a reanalysis dataset, with a resolution of around 40 – 50 km. Mesoscale models offer a potentially more desirable solution, with a homogeneous set of wind speeds covering a wide area at resolutions of 1 – 50 km, but they are computationally expensive to run at high resolution. An understanding of the most appropriate choice of data requires knowledge of the variability {{in time and space}} and how well that is represented by the choice of model.

40|$|Summary] The dataset for the European {{electricity}} {{system needs}} {{a variety of}} data to cover the relevant characteristics of the industry. The more general data on <b>aggregated</b> <b>generation</b> capacities, historic generation, and consumption can be found with a consistent data specification for most European countries in databases like EUROSTAT. On the other hand, more detailed data like generation capacities for conventional and renewable sources are usually not publicly available, sometimes not even on a national basis, and henceforth appropriate assumptions or commercial databases are required to retrieve the necessary information. Due to the already mentioned issue with regard to available information, setting up a consistent dataset for the European electricity system is more difficult {{in comparison to the}} German electricity system, where mostly consistent data is publicly available. Similar projects on a European level could be helpful for a consistent dataset. Having set up a dataset for Europe, the model application shows that the general tendencies on regional generation and import/export pattern can be captured. However, differences are obvious in particular regions where the model shows different results than the historic values which may be based either on the rough modeling approach or on an insufficient data supply. To that end, the presented dataset and model application are a continuous process, and further steps are required to improve the data quality as well as the modeling.

40|$|Climate change {{generates a}} {{conflict}} between generations: while {{it is in the}} interest of the current generation to continue to exploit inexpensive carbon-based fuel to drive economic growth, it {{is in the interest of}} future generations that we reduce our carbon emissions by making these fuels more expensive. This raises the following question: what moral framework should we use to adjudicate between the interests of different generations? In this work, I argue that the commonly used framework of "cost-benefit analysis"-the analytic framework for public policy that developed out of the field of welfare economics-fails as a normative framework for intergenerational policy. For one, by aggregating costs and benefits across all generations, it ignores that what matters is each generation. For another, by reducing all value into a unitary objective function, it ignores important distinctions between different categories of moral claims. Third, by attempting to optimize a function across all time, it reflects a false sense of knowledge about the distant future. For all these reasons-and more-I conclude that this approach cannot offer a reasonable normative framework for intergenerational public policy. In its stead, I propose an "intergenerational threshold" principle which avoids <b>aggregating</b> <b>generations</b> together, gives space for different categories of value, and, I will argue, is more robust to the epistemic limitations of intergenerational policy analysis. by Nathan R.

40|$|North Carolina {{is located}} within the Southeastern region of The United States, an area which has {{experienced}} varying degrees of drought {{over the last two}} decades. Water withdrawal and consumption are integral and unavoidable components of the electricity generation process whenever it is fueled by non-renewable sources of primary energy. It follows from these two statements, that North Carolina - which largely depends on base-load coal and nuclear thermoelectric power generation - will be vulnerable to electricity supply disruptions in times of severe drought. In this report, an attempt is made to quantify the financial or economic impact on privately-owned utility companies as well as the state economy. The report will cover various issues en-route to quantifying the impact of drought including: identifying areas in the state historically prone to drought, locations of major power plants in relation to these drier areas, electricity generation costs of different powers plants within the state as well as changes in <b>aggregate</b> <b>generation</b> costs under different scenarios when countering the adverse effects of drought. Major findings include that roughly 5000 MW of baseload generation capacity is situated in especially drought prone regions and that droughts severe enough to result in plant shutdowns occur once in three decades. Economic impact on the state would run well into the hundreds of millions while individual utilities will see lower cost impacts in absolute terms potentially leading to underinvestment in drought-mitigating measures. These potential economic and financial losses are then used as a basis to explore the possibilities for making investments in less water-intensive technologies for electricity supply. The alternative investment options are then compared to find the most cost effective. Such investments would alleviate the pressure on the state’s finite fresh surface water resources while simultaneously mitigating against any drought-induced electricity supply disruptions...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies an {{electricity}} market {{consisting of}} an independent system operator (ISO) {{and a group of}} generators. The goal is to solve the DC optimal power flow (DC-OPF) problem: have the generators collectively meet the power demand while minimizing the <b>aggregate</b> <b>generation</b> cost and respecting line flow limits in the network. The ISO by itself cannot solve the DC-OPF problem as generators are strategic and do not share their cost functions. Instead, each generator submits to the ISO a bid, consisting of the price per unit of electricity at which it is willing to provide power. Based on the bids, the ISO decides how much production to allocate to each generator to minimize the total payment while meeting the load and satisfying the line limits. We provide a provably correct, decentralized iterative scheme, termed BID ADJUSTMENT ALGORITHM, for the resulting Bertrand competition game. Regarding convergence, we show that the algorithm takes the generators' bids to any desired neighborhood of the efficient Nash equilibrium at a linear convergence rate. As a consequence, the optimal production of the generators converges to the optimizer of the DC-OPF problem. Regarding robustness, we show that the algorithm is robust to affine perturbations in the bid adjustment scheme and that there is no incentive for any individual generator to deviate from the algorithm by using an alternative bid update scheme. We also establish the algorithm robustness to collusion, i. e., we show that, as long as each bus with generation has a generator following the strategy, there is no incentive for any group of generators to share information with the intent of tricking the system to obtain a higher payoff.

In the first part of this thesis, aggregation/fragmentation dynamics of hard-gel single size microparticles suspended in a Newtonian liquid owing through a straight channel is studied by numerical simulations. A one-way Discrete Element Method is employed to simulate the motion and the adhesion of the particles. The formation and fragmentation of aggregates, and their deposition at the channel walls are investigated by varying the Reynolds number and the strength of the adhesive force. In addition, a non-periodic channel is considered to simulate the start-up phase of aggregate formation till a `pseudo steady-state' condition. Results in terms of micro-structures, particle velocity profiles, and spatial and temporal evolution of aggregates in 2 D and cylindrical (3 D) channels are presented and discussed, respectively. In the second part, I studied the two different size microparticles suspended in a Newtonian fluid in laminar flow, by implementing all the above condition except that different adhesive forces combination is used to test various condition in microfluidics in cylindrical (3 D) channels. My results show that variation in adhesion forces and Reynold number have a dominating influence on the whole system i. e., at very high adhesion and Reynolds number, the rate of large <b>aggregates</b> <b>generation</b> and wall attachment rate increase tremendously and in case of different size particles big size particle have strong influence in aggregation and wall attachment.
