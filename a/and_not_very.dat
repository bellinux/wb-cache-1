5|$|AI {{behavior}} in Halo Wars 2 drew some criticism. Some reviewers described the pathfinding of units as substandard, and others considered the enemy AI {{to be too}} easy <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>very</b> smart on the normal difficulty setting. IGN reviews editor Dan Stapleton disliked that bases had to placed in predetermined locations; he {{found it to be}} limiting and said it constrained build order freedom. Rock, Paper, Shotgun writer Fraser Brown was also concerned about the restrictions on base building initially, however he became fond of the idea after playing the game for some time.|$|E
5|$|Having {{inherited}} the Habsburg lip <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>very</b> feminine looks, Mary {{was not considered}} physically attractive. Her portraits, letters, and comments by her contemporaries do not assign her the easy Burgundian charm possessed by her grandmother, Duchess Mary of Burgundy, and her aunt Margaret. Nevertheless, she {{proved to be a}} determined and skillful politician, as well as an enthusiastic patron of literature, music, and hunting.|$|E
5|$|This {{version was}} criticised {{even before the}} museum board had had time to present their own view. August Brunius, who had {{expressed}} his enthusiasm for the Gustav Vasa painting, reacted against the choice of subject, like most critics. The choice of subject was only aggravated by {{the way it was}} presented. Brunius felt the painting to be unreal, unbelievable <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>very</b> relevant for the modern Swedes of the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Péron {{stated that}} the nest was usually {{situated}} near water {{and on the ground}} under the shade of a bush. It was constructed of sticks and lined with dead leaves and moss; it was oval in shape <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>very</b> deep. He claimed that seven to nine eggs were laid always on 25 and 26 July, but the selective advantage of this breeding synchronisation is unknown. The female incubated the eggs, but the male apparently developed a brood patch, which indicates it contributed as well. The non-incubating parent also stayed by the nest, and the chicks left the nest two to three days after hatching. The eggs were preyed upon by snakes, rats, and quolls. Péron gave the incubation period as five or six weeks, but since the mainland emu incubates for 50 to 56 days, this may be too short. He stated a mother emu would defend its young from crows with its beak, but this is now known to be strictly male behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Several medieval authors {{wrote about}} Ahmad ibn Tulun. The two major sources are two biographies by two 10th-century authors, Ibn al-Daya and al-Balawi. Both are called Sirat Ahmad ibn Tulun, and al-Balawi's work relies {{to a large}} extent on Ibn al-Daya's, {{although}} it is much more extensive. Ibn al-Daya also wrote a book (Kitab al-mukafa'a) with anecdotes from the Tulunid-era Egyptian society. Further information comes from Ibn Tulun's contemporary, the geographer and traveler Ya'qubi, whose works cover the first years of his rule in Egypt, and from later Egyptian authors, especially the 15th-century historians Ibn Duqmaq and al-Maqrizi, who drew on a variety of earlier sources to write {{on the history of the}} Tulunid state. Several other medieval Arabic chroniclers from the 13th to the 16th centuries mention Ibn Tulun or his officials, but most are of a later date <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>very</b> reliable, especially in comparison to Ibn Duqmaq and al-Maqrizi.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch Infantry used about 2,200 7.92mm Schwarzlose M.08 machine guns, partly licence produced, {{and eight}} hundred Vickers machine guns. Many {{of these were}} fitted in the pillboxes; each {{battalion}} had a heavy machine gun company of twelve. The Dutch infantry squads were equipped with an organic light machine gun, the M.20 Lewis machine gun, of which about eight thousand were available. This weapon was prone to jamming <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>very</b> suitable for offensive operations. Most Dutch infantry were equipped with the Dutch Mannlicher rifle, {{a variant of the}} Mannlicher M1893. This weapon had been in service with the Dutch military for over 40 years and its obsolescence had become obvious, but the Dutch military did not have the money to replace it. There were but six 80mm mortars for each regiment. This lack of firepower seriously impaired the fighting performance of the Dutch infantry.|$|E

25|$|Before they tackled Shostakovich's work, Eliasberg had {{the players}} go through {{pieces from the}} {{standard}} repertoire—Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov—which they also performed for broadcast. Because the city was still blockaded at the time, the score was flown by night in early July for rehearsal. A team of copyists worked for days to prepare the parts despite shortages of materials. At rehearsal, some musicians protested, not wanting to waste their little strength on an intricate <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>very</b> accessible work. Eliasberg threatened {{to hold back the}} additional rations, quelling any dissent.|$|E

Soon afterwards, an alarm went out in Uskedal warning that three German E-boat fast attack craft were entering the Hardangerfjord. In response, district commander Orlogskaptein (Lieutenant Commander) Ulstrup – the former commander of the mine layer Tyr – gave an oral order that Sæl was to avoid contact with the superior enemy force. Ulstrup felt that the poorly armed, slow <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>very</b> manoeuvrable Sæl would not {{stand a chance against}} the three fast and modern opponents.|$|E

25|$|During the {{religious}} peace which followed {{the persecution of}} Marcus Aurelius, the new bishop divided his activities between the duties of a pastor and of a missionary (as to which we have but brief data, late <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>very</b> certain). Almost all his writings were directed against Gnosticism. The most famous of these writings is Adversus haereses (Against Heresies). Irenaeus alludes to coming across Gnostic writings, and holding conversations with Gnostics, and this may {{have taken place in}} Asia Minor or in Rome. However, it also appears that Gnosticism was present near Lyon: he writes that there were followers of 'Marcus the Magician' living and teaching in the Rhone valley.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{reception}} for MUSHA was mixed. Critics found themselves {{overwhelmed by the}} sheer amount of shoot 'em ups on the Sega Genesis and felt the title was unremarkable. Journalists generally agreed the game had great graphics and enjoyable gameplay, but felt it was unoriginal <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>very</b> challenging. In retrospect, MUSHA has garnered much higher praise, being cited for its challenging gameplay, strong soundtrack, and graphics considered ahead of its time. It remains among the most highly regarded shoot 'em ups on the Genesis and is considered among {{the best of the}} 16-bit era. Original MUSHA cartridges have become rare and command high prices in the collector market, however, the game was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan in 2008, and the west in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Mucocutaneous {{leishmaniasis}} is {{very difficult}} to treat. Treatment involves the use of pentavalent antimonial compounds, which are highly toxic (common side effects include thrombophlebitis, pancreatitis, cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity) <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>very</b> effective. For example, in one study, despite treatment with high doses of sodium stibogluconate for 28 days, only 30% of patients remained disease-free at 12 months follow-up. Even in those patients who achieve an apparent cure, as many as 19% will relapse. Several drug combinations with immunomodulators have been tested, for example, a combination of pentoxifylline (inhibitor of TNF-α) and a pentavalent antimonial at a high dose for 30 days in a small-scale (23 patients) randomised placebo-controlled study from Brazil achieved cure rates of 90% and reduced time to cure, a result that should be interpreted cautiously in light of inherent limitations of small-scale studies. In an earlier small-scale (12 patients) study, addition of imiquimod showed promising results which need yet to be confirmed in larger trials.|$|E

25|$|Octavian {{offered an}} early amnesty to his opponents and Horace quickly {{accepted}} it. On returning to Italy, he {{was confronted with}} yet another loss: his father's estate in Venusia {{was one of many}} throughout Italy to be confiscated for the settlement of veterans (Virgil lost his estate in the north about the same time). Horace later claimed that he was reduced to poverty and this led him to try his hand at poetry. In reality, there was no money to be had from versifying. At best, it offered future prospects through contacts with other poets and their patrons among the rich. Meanwhile, he obtained the sinecure of scriba quaestorius, a civil service position at the aerarium or Treasury, profitable enough to be purchased even by members of the ordo equester <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>very</b> demanding in its work-load, since tasks could be delegated to scribae or permanent clerks.

25|$|Players {{assume the}} role of Daniel Lamb in third-person {{perspective}} while at some points they instead control the villain Leo Kasper. Although different in appearance and personality, both have similar controls. As with the original game, the primary gameplay mechanic is stealth execution, whereby the player character must approach an enemy from behind, undetected, and kill them. There are three 'levels' of execution, with each level progressively more violent and graphic than the last; Level 1 (Hasty) executions are quick <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>very</b> bloody, Level 2 (Violent) are considerably more gory, and Level 3 (Gruesome) are over-the-top. The player is entirely in control of which level they use; once the player has locked onto an enemy, the lock-on reticule changes color over time to indicate the level; white (level 1), yellow (level 2), and, finally, red (level 3). When playing on PC or Wii while doing the executions, there is a quick time event in which lists down certain moves that either the mouse or Wii Controller must move or by pressing a certain button at a specific time in order to finish the execution. If it does not finish in the specific time, it will stop the execution and skip the execution completely, although the player still kills the person.|$|E
25|$|Despite their {{flattened}} shape, satellite glial cells contain all common organelles {{necessary to}} make cellular products and to maintain the homeostatic environment of the cell. The plasma membrane of SGCs is thin <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>very</b> dense, and it is associated with adhesion molecules, receptors for neurotransmitters and other molecules, and ion channels, specifically potassium ion channels. Within individual SGCs, there is both rough endoplasmic reticulum and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, but the latter is much less abundant. Most often the Golgi apparatus and the centrioles in an SGC are found in a region {{very close to the}} cell’s nucleus. On the other hand, mitochondria are found throughout the cytoplasm along with the organelles involved in autophagy and other forms of catabolic degradation, such as lysosomes, lipofuscin granules, and peroxisomes. Both microtubules and intermediate filaments can be seen throughout the cytoplasm, and most often they lie parallel to the SGC sheath. These filaments are found in greater concentrations at the axon hillock and at the beginning portion of an axon in an SGC of the sympathetic ganglia. In some SGCs of the sensory ganglia researchers have seen a single cilium that extends outward from the cell surface near the nucleus and into the extracellular space of a deep indentation in the plasma membrane. The cilium, however, only has the nine pairs of peripheral microtubules while it lacks the axial pair of microtubules, making its structure very similar to the cilia of neurons, Schwann cells, and astrocytes of the CNS.|$|E
