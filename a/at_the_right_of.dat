Behind them in turn, the Earl of Manchester's regiment repulsed and scattered Blakiston's brigade.|$|E

25|$|In MWd reduplication, the A-not-A {{operator}} copies {{the adjacent}} MWd and moves the reduplicant MWd overtly {{to the left}} of the base MWd or to right of the base maximal projection containing the MWd. Otherwise, the reduplicant can move covertly, not spelled-out, to the right of the base maximal projection containing the MWd. The negation is then inserted between the reduplicant and base to form a grammatical sentence. In (9.a) the A-not-A operator copies the MWd taoyan. The reduplicant taoyan is overtly put at the left of the base taoyan and then the negative constituent bu is inserted in between. In (9.b) the A-not-A operator copies the MWd taoyan.

500|$|In {{the sports}} game Solipskier, the player draws {{the ground for}} the {{on-screen}} skier to pass through a level filled with gates, tunnels, and walls. Drawing an incline, for example, will launch the skier into the air to perform tricks, and a downhill section will accelerate the skier. Upcoming obstacles are indicated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the screen along with the necessary altitude and distance. A streak of successful passes through gates will accrue a bonus score. The skier's speed also increases with time. As an endless runner (compared to Canabalt), the characters advance until they die, {{as there is no}} end. If the skier travels fast enough, he loses his headphones, which cuts out the background music {{to the sound of the}} wind passing by. The player receives [...] "All Star Dunk Contest-like scorecards" [...] after landing big jumps. Solipskier also has an online leaderboard, and offers tips for new players to improve their scores. It focuses on style and emotion from the player-character's terminal speed rather than on jumps and tricks. It also has a hard rock guitar soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|On 27 April Meldrum was {{promoted}} to brigadier-general and given command of the New Zealand brigade, although he was temporarily replaced as commanding officer by Major Charles Dick. On 30 April the Wellington regiment returned to the front, manning a line of observation posts in the Weli Sheikh Nuran defence system. They were <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the British line, which stretched along the Wadi Ghuzze to the Mediterranean Sea, south of Gaza. As well as manning the trenches, they carried out mounted patrols into no man's land. On 8 June it was their turn {{to return to the}} rear rest area at Marakeb, and Lieutenant-Colonel James Whyte assumed command of the regiment. On 8 July the 9th Squadron captured a Turkish outpost [...] to the west of Beersheba, from which they could clearly see the village's defences. Ten days later the regiment assaulted what they believed was a strong Turkish position at Khalassa, but discovered the defenders had withdrawn before their approach. On 19 July a Turkish force attacked across the Wadi Imleih towards Karm. The regiment moved forward to occupy a line of observation posts the next day, but again discovered that the Turks had withdrawn. Over the next weeks the regiment carried out numerous patrols around Beersheba, checking on the Turkish defences and dispositions. On 18 August they were sent to Marakeb to rest. Four weeks later, on 18 September, they returned to the front line at Fukhari.|$|E
500|$|Producer Ron Hauge came up {{with the}} idea of someone {{shooting}} a bird and feeling guilty about it. Hauge told the staff a few weeks before Cohen started writing the episode that when he was 13 or 14 years old, he accidentally killed a bird after he got a Wrist Rocket slingshot, and took a shot at a bird that he thought was [...] "far, far away". Hauge said his friends were excited about it, but he was [...] "dying inside". For the scene in which the bird is killed, Cohen received further inspiration from an episode of The Andy Griffith Show entitled [...] "Opie the Birdman". The writers were trying to figure out a way to have Bart kill the bird without actually wanting to kill it, and decided to give the gun a crooked sight that Bart would be unaware of, so when Bart intentionally takes a shot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the bird to avoid it, the bullet still hits the bird. After Bart kills the mother bird, he imagines himself before a bird court with a vulture, an eagle, and a toucan as judges. This sequence was added to [...] "liven up the visuals", because the writers thought the episode tended too heavily towards extreme realism and because most of the scenes in the episode were taking place in and around the Simpsons' house. Then-show runner Mike Scully had done the same thing with an episode he wrote for season seven called [...] "Marge Be Not Proud". In that episode, Bart gets caught shoplifting, and writer Bill Oakley suggested the addition of a fantasy sequence to get away from the realism in the episode.|$|E
