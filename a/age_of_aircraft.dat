The study superficially examined the extent of these determinant factors on airline productivity. In the study, quantitative techniques such as one simple t-test and Friedman’s rank test and were employed. The data {{used in the study}} were both secondary and primary data collected from the airline employees and customers (passengers) in selected airlines of MMA and Port Harcourt International airport in Nigeria, using structured questionnaires and oral interviews. The critical factor affecting airline productivity in Nigeria is Sincere and responsive attitude to passenger complaints, with a mean rank of 26. 79. This is closely followed by <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft,</b> with a mean rank of 26. 09, and Technical qualities/success to complete a trip, with a mean rank of 24. 68.
