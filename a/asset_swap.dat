25|$|Under the Duffie construct, {{the price}} of a credit default swap can also be derived by calculating the <b>asset</b> <b>swap</b> spread of a bond. If a bond has a spread of 100, and the swap spread is 70 basis points, then a CDS {{contract}} should trade at 30. However, there are sometimes technical reasons why this will not be the case, and this may or may not present an arbitrage opportunity for the canny investor. The difference between the theoretical model and the actual price of a credit default swap is known as the basis.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{unconventional}} monetary policies on exchange rates and its spillovers to other economies {{is not yet}} fully understood. In this paper I develop a two-country DSGE model with interbank markets and endogenous default probabilities to analyze the cross-border impacts of unconventional monetary policy. I {{examine the impact of}} two unconventional measures commonly used: central bank liquidity injections and <b>asset</b> <b>swaps.</b> I find that liquidity injections lead to a short run appreciation of domestic currency, but a mild long run depreciation. In contrast, <b>asset</b> <b>swaps</b> cause a short run depreciation of domestic currency, but a long run appreciation. Lastly, when both countries coordinate on the implementation of unconventional policies, the model yields the following results: Non-coordinated liquidity injections lead to higher increases with respect to output and inflation variation, but have negative spillovers on the other economy in terms of lower growth. By contrast, coordinating <b>asset</b> <b>swaps</b> leads to higher increases in output and lower fluctuation in inflation in both countries. The results of this paper suggest that coordination in unconventional monetary policy may not always yield an optimal outcome, and macroeconomic outcomes in both countries depend crucially on the choice of instrument...|$|R

40|$|Banks use {{over-the-counter}} derivative (OTCD) contracts for sharing {{the risks of}} their asset streams. OTCDs are composed of an optimal combination of interbank loans, <b>asset</b> <b>swaps</b> and credit default swaps (CDS). The settlement of ex-post realized claims are renegotiated by participating banks after defaults {{by one or more}} banks to minimize the systemic impact of the default. The bailout by a solvent bank of an insolvent one creates a positive externality for all other solvent banks in the system with claims due from the insolvent bank. The lack of coordination among the solvent banks leads to an inefficient liquidation policy (system-wide runs) even though we allow mergers among them to potentially internalize the positive externality. Interbanks loans and CDS contracts have relatively lower incentive costs than swaps, but the former has the largest distress costs without renegotiations. With renegotiations, the payoffs of interbank loans and CDS are similar in strong bankruptcy regimes, while the latter dominate in weak regimes. <b>Asset</b> <b>swaps</b> provide the best hedging and are optimal for banks without incentive problems. Hedging with optimal OTCD contracts creates a tradeoff between the amount of credit risk and systemic risk (liquidation spillover) in the banking system...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>asset</b> <b>swap</b> buyer {{enters into}} a swap to pay fixed coupons to the <b>asset</b> <b>swap</b> seller {{equal to the}} fixed rate coupons {{received}} from the bond. In return the <b>asset</b> <b>swap</b> buyer receives regular payments of Libor plus (or minus) an agreed fixed spread. The maturity of this swap {{is the same as}} the maturity of the asset.|$|E
5000|$|On a {{technical}} note, when the <b>asset</b> <b>swap</b> is initiated between coupon dates, the <b>asset</b> <b>swap</b> buyer {{does not pay}} the accrued interest explicitly. Effectively, the full price of the bond is at par. At the next coupon period the <b>asset</b> <b>swap</b> buyer receives the full coupon on the bond and likewise pays the full coupon on the swap. However, the floating side payment, which may have a different frequency and accrual basis to fixed side, is adjusted by the corresponding accrual factor. Therefore, if we are exactly half way between floating side coupons, the floating payment received is half of the Libor plus <b>asset</b> <b>swap</b> spread. This feature prevents the calculated <b>asset</b> <b>swap</b> spread from jumping {{as we move forward}} in time through coupon dates.|$|E

Inflation swaps are the linear form of these derivatives.

During the crisis, arbitrage opportunities decrease to 9 % and 17 %, respectively. After considering funding and trading costs, we find statistical arbitrage opportunities in 16 % of the cases before the crisis but never during the crisis.

Liberalization of Financial markets and financial distress are new to China. The main advantage of the case study approach is that it provides information rich in-depth analysis of complex events which large-scale empirical studies tend to ignore. Since there is no prior work on the distress resolution strategies in China, it is most appropriate to use the case study approach. It helps us provide a deep understanding of unique features in China, such as {{the role of government}} and other more commercially driven shareholders, and the subsequent importance of social policy issues; protracted and complex nature of the restructurings; and the frequent use of mergers, <b>asset</b> <b>swaps</b> and <b>asset</b> sales. We also analyze the stock market responses to the announcements of the restructuring strategies and changes in accounting information. We offer a broad understanding of how the firms cope with distress in a recently liberalized financial market like China where distress itself is a very recent phenomenon. We also provide new hypotheses for further empirical study on a large scale basis...|$|R
