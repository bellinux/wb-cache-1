The lights are mounted on the bike wheels and powered every time a magnet on the wheel spoke passes, eliminating the need for batteries.

The Port of New Bedford, Massachusetts is America's #1 Fishing Port with fish landings valued at $369 million. Each year, {{there are nearly}} 50 million pounds of sea scallops landed there. The striped bass was driven to low levels early in the 1980s. Catch restrictions were applied in the mid 1980s, and by 1995 this species of fish had recovered. The region has valuable mollusk fisheries too. Offshore are sea scallops, surfclams, American lobsters and ocean quahog. Inshore are oysters, blue mussels, blue crabs, and clam fisheries. These fisheries <b>are</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> fully exploited.|$|E

Richard Meyer, spokesman for DEA's San Francisco Field Division, has stated that, [...] "It is our opinion that those books <b>are</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> cookbooks on how to make illegal drugs.

[...] In other words, biofuels <b>are</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> like any other product. [...] In 2008 the Nobel prize-winning chemist Paul J.

[...] Similarly, Leah Collins of Dose magazine wrote, [...] "New jack swing dance moves and costume changes <b>are</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> {{the focus of this}} one. [...] Still, Beyonce reveals a talent we never knew she had: the ability to switch costumes every time she switches keys. (This, it turns out, is a good thing. That pantsless African dictator look in the first scene? Maybe we're the only ones, but we're not really feeling Idi Amin-chic this season.)" [...] Georgette Cline of The Boombox found similarities between the video for [...] "Love On Top" [...] and the earlier videos that Beyoncé made with Destiny's Child while Sarah Anne Hughes of The Washington Post called the video fancy and an [...] "obvious homage to New Edition's 'If It Isn’t Love.'" [...] A more mixed review was given by Amanda Dobbins of New York magazine who wrote that [...] "The video will do nothing to silence Beyoncé plagiarism or baby bump conspiracy theorists; the first half borrows from an old New Edition video, and the entire thing was clearly filmed before her bump began to show." [...] However, she added, [...] "Still, Vulture salutes any artistic undertaking that requires a costume change with every key change." [...] The video was nominated in the category for Video of the Year at the 2012 BET Awards and in the category for Best Female Video at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards. It won Best Dance Performance at the 2012 Soul Train Music Awards.|$|E

2500|$|Spirits dead wheel {{turned out}} to be a mixed blessing. As it was {{traveling}} in March 2007, pulling the dead wheel behind, the wheel scraped off the upper layer of the Martian soil, uncovering a patch of ground that scientists say shows evidence of a past environment that would have been perfect for microbial life. It is similar to areas on Earth where water or steam from hot springs came into contact with volcanic rocks. On Earth, these are locations that tend to teem with bacteria, said rover chief scientist Steve Squyres. [...] "We're really excited about this," [...] he told a meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). The area is extremely rich in silica–the main ingredient of window glass. The researchers have now concluded that the bright material must have been produced in one of two ways. One: hot-spring deposits produced when water dissolved silica at one location and then carried it to another (i.e. a geyser). Two: acidic steam rising through cracks in rocks [...] stripped them of their mineral components, leaving silica behind. [...] "The important thing is that whether it is one hypothesis or the other, the implications for the former habitability of Mars <b>are</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> the same," [...] Squyres explained to BBC News. Hot water provides an environment in which microbes can thrive and the precipitation of that silica entombs and preserves them. Squyres added, [...] "You can go to hot springs and you can go to fumaroles and at either place on Earth it is teeming with life – microbial life." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Geoff Ginsberg of AllMusic wrote: [...] "Whatever Happened to Slade is the band's extremely loud {{reply to the}} news that they were has-beens. Whereas Slade had been a huge influence on Kiss, the favor was now returned, as Whatever {{has a bit of}} the Hotter Than Hell, early-Kiss sound, which the band has acknowledged. It's still pure Slade, though. The songs and playing here <b>are</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> out of sight, with monster riffs and a different production style. For the Slade fan, this is a great record, and one you probably never heard. Rectify that." [...] Joe Geesin of Get Ready to Rock! said of the 2007 Salvo remaster: [...] "legendarily titled after a genuine piece of graffiti, the album is a return to the band's skinhead roots. It was also their first album since leaving Polydor. Some rough Slade style rock'n'roll, but gone was the glam (largely) and the kitsch. Still very much Slade, but if you're only familiar with the early 70s hits this is a very different beast. There's some great rough guitar." [...] In 2010, Classic Rock considered the album [...] "superior: reputation cementing" [...] and wrote: [...] "Viewed with hindsight as the band's 'lost' album, Whatever Happened to Slade was buried by punk, yet praised by many punk musicians. But however marginalised, a world-beating band doesn't become shit overnight, and Whatever Happened to Slade tempers their established qualities with righteous indignation." [...] Colin Harper of Record Collector said: [...] "Returning from their lengthy attempt to crack America, Whatever Happened to Slade showed muscle, but the prime influence was US stadium boogie, paired with Noddy's least charming lyrics." ...|$|E
