500|$|Island Records was keen on Drake {{promoting}} Bryter Layter through press interviews, radio {{sessions and}} live appearances. Drake, who {{by this time}} was smoking what Kirby has described as [...] "unbelievable amounts" [...] of cannabis and exhibiting [...] "the first signs of psychosis", refused. Disappointed by the reaction to Bryter Layter, he turned his thoughts inwards, and withdrew from family and friends. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs. His sister recalled: [...] "This was a very bad time. He {{once said to me}} that everything started to go wrong from [...] time on, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> when things started to go wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|Rippy {{began writing}} {{music for the}} game in April 2007. [...] "Some of the plot points of Halo Wars revolve around discovery, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> my {{favorite}} idea to write to—that sense of, 'no one's seen this before,'" [...] he said. The first two tracks combined repurposed elements from past projects with his efforts to convey the Halo sound. [...] "Flollo" [...] contained musical ideas Rippy had experimented with since his last project, [...] [...] "Bad Here Day" [...] was the first piece in which he tried to incorporate the [...] "Halo sound". Rippy felt it important to avoid repeating too many old themes because he wanted the game {{to have its own}} identity; however, he wanted to continue to incorporate choir and piano, elements he believed to be integral to the sound of previous Halo games. In adherence to an Ensemble Studios tradition, the tracks are often named after coined phrases and inside jokes, rather than in-game events.|$|E
500|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the Tower of Joy, actor Robert Aramayo was cast to play a young Eddard Stark. In an interview with Access Hollywood, Aramayo stated {{that he was a}} big fan of the series, and that [...] "it was an honor and a gift {{to be able to be}} a part of it." [...] In regards to portraying the character similar to Sean Bean, who played Eddard Stark in the first season, Aramayo noted, [...] "I didn't want to get too hung up in sounding like Sean because I think that would've sort of got in my way if I'd have just situated all my work in that place. I watched a lot of footage of him playing Ned in the first season again, repeatedly, especially one particular fight scene that he was in <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the biggest help for me when creating this version of Ned – was watching what Sean did with Ned in the first season and trying to work out what a younger man's version of that is." [...] In a separate interview with The Hollywood Reporter Aramayo spoke about auditioning for the role, stating, [...] "The chance to audition to be on the show was a dream, even to audition. It was an absolute dream to me. I was very excited to audition, and landing the role was beyond my wildest dreams. Then when I found out the role was Ned, it was overwhelming." ...|$|E

5000|$|... “I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{comes from}} them being easy to wear,” said Glamour Magazine’s Anne Christensen. “I know that {{simplifies}} it, but it’s like shapes {{that are easy}} to wear and colors that are fun to wear… <b>I</b> <b>think</b> what her shows always have is a real sense of optimism <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> what we all need today <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> came through in the bright patterns <b>and</b> colors <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> something that she does so well.” ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Marriage {{should be}} {{a man and a}} woman...I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the {{domestic}} partnership legislation in NY has worked very, very well. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> a good way to deal with it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would be a good model for other states to have. Some places call them domestic partnerships, some states call it civil unions, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> would {{be the best way to}} deal with it." ...|$|R
2500|$|You can't {{categorize}} him. He's one {{of those}} singers that's not in one track. And yet and still I think that his records had more excitement and life into it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> his big selling point, {{that he was so}} full of energy. You know when you hear his records it was dynamite energy. — Herb Jeffries ...|$|E
2500|$|Being {{a period}} of that era of the 1950's I think being gay must have been pretty harsh for Graham. I can imagine...everybody knew, nobody cared, but I think {{it was such a}} time when you didn't talk about issues that were personal, and I think that made him much more secretive and reclusive, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{probably}} quite a tough thing for him... — Susan Gaye Anderson ...|$|E
2500|$|Byrne revitalized the {{slumping}} {{title with}} his run. Originally, Byrne was slated to write with Sienkiewicz providing the art. Sienkiewicz {{left to do}} Moon Knight, and Byrne ended up as writer, artist, and inker. Various editors {{were assigned to the}} comic; eventually Bob Budiansky became the regular editor. Byrne told Jim Shooter that he could not work with Budiansky, although they ultimately continued to work together. In 2006, Byrne said [...] "that's my paranoia. I look back <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> Shooter trying to force me off the book". Byrne left following issue #293 (Aug. 1986) {{in the middle of a}} story arc, explaining he could not recapture the fun he had previously had on the series. One of Byrne's changes was making the Invisible Girl into the Invisible Woman: assertive and confident. During this period, fans came to recognize that she was quite powerful, whereas previously, she had been primarily seen as a superpowered mother and wife in the tradition of television moms like those played by Donna Reed and Florence Henderson.|$|E
5000|$|Farrell, {{who is a}} Christian, {{believes}} that marriage is {{between a man and}} a woman but has said [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have the right or anybody has a right to tell somebody who they can or can't love. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this is a civil rights issue. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the right thing to do is let the voters decide." ...|$|R

2500|$|Foy {{appears in}} her feature-film debut {{as the girl}} {{who is accused of}} being a witch. Known for her titular role in the British miniseries Little Dorrit, she met Sena and sought the role in Season of the Witch. She {{explained}} the choice, [...] "It's quite a manipulative role; the character does a lot of manipulating. Pitting other people against each other, being quite mischievous... That was something I thought would obviously be good to do." [...] Foy researched witchcraft and demonic possession for the role. She described its appeal, [...] "Playing a character that was making things happen, and mainly in control of an entire group of men. And for once, be the character that is completely in the know about everything. There is nothing that she doesn't know. Nothing is a surprise. And she is able to deal with every single situation that arises the way that she sees fit. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> quite refreshing {{to be able to play}} a character that wasn't entirely beholden to everyone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{script was}} written by Victor Miller, who later went on to write for several {{television}} soap operas, including Guiding Light, One Life to Live and All My Children. Miller delighted in inventing a serial killer {{who turned out to}} be somebody's mother, a murderer whose only motivation was her love for her child. [...] "I took motherhood and turned it on its head <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> great fun. Mrs. Voorhees was the mother I'd always wanted—a mother who would have killed for her kids." [...] Miller was unhappy about the filmmakers' decision to make Jason Voorhees the killer in the sequels. [...] "Jason was dead from the very beginning. He was a victim, not a villain." [...] The idea of Jason appearing at the end of the film was initially not used in the original script, and was actually suggested by makeup designer Tom Savini. Savini stated that [...] "The whole reason for the cliffhanger at the end was I had just seen Carrie, so we thought that we need a 'chair jumper' like that, and I said, 'let's bring in Jason'".|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hush, my dear!' replied Mrs Nickleby, in {{the same}} tone of voice, 'he is very polite, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a {{quotation}} from the poets. Pray, don't worry me so--you'll pinch my arm black and blue. Go away, sir!' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Wyllard dryly, [...] "we had three, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{one cause}} of the trouble. There was {{one from the other}} schooner. You see, those seals belonged to the Russians, and we free-lances could shoot them only off shore. I'm not sure that the men in the wrecked boat had been fishing outside the limit." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{the vision}} that had {{remained}} with him always, dazzling his eyes {{so that he}} could not see the truth; and notwithstanding the brutality of fact, he continued to see with the eyes of the spirit an Italy of romantic brigands and picturesque ruins. It was an ideal that he painted -- a poor one, common and shop-soiled, but still it was an ideal; and it gave his character a peculiar charm.|$|E
6000|$|... "His comrades {{called him}} Jim, as <b>I</b> have said; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he once {{referred}} {{to himself as}} Jim Cuttance, or something like that." ...|$|R

60|$|Dora told me, shortly afterwards, {{that she}} was going to be a {{wonderful}} housekeeper. Accordingly, she polished the tablets, pointed the pencil, bought an immense account-book, carefully stitched up with a needle and thread all the leaves of the Cookery Book which Jip had torn, and made quite a desperate little attempt 'to be good', as she called it. But the figures had the old obstinate propensity--they WOULD NOT add up. When she had entered two or three laborious items in the account-book, Jip would walk over the page, wagging his tail, and smear them all out. Her own little right-hand middle finger got steeped to the very bone in ink; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the only decided result obtained.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jims {{has had a}} few {{attacks of}} croup this fall--just the {{ordinary}} croup--not that terrible thing he had last year. But whatever blood runs in his little veins it is good, healthy blood. He is rosy and plump and curly and cute; and he says such funny things and asks such comical questions. He likes very much {{to sit in a}} special chair in the kitchen; but that is Susan's favourite chair, too, and when she wants it, out Jims must go. The last time she put him out of it he turned around and asked solemnly, 'When you are dead, Susan, can I sit in that chair?' Susan thought it quite dreadful, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> when she began to feel anxiety about his possible ancestry. The other night I took Jims with me for a walk down to the store. It {{was the first time he}} had ever been out so late at night, and when he saw the stars he exclaimed, 'Oh, Willa, see the big moon and all the little moons!' And last Wednesday morning, when he woke up, my little alarm clock had stopped because I had forgotten to wind it up. Jims bounded out of his crib and ran across to me, his face quite aghast above his little blue flannel pyjamas. 'The clock is dead,' he gasped, 'oh Willa, the clock is dead.' ...|$|E
60|$|And {{as to the}} Butterfly's Ball itself? Imagination had {{depicted}} a splendid realization of the verses, and it was flat to find it merely a children's fancy ball, no acting at all, only dancing, {{and most of the}} children not attempting any characteristic dress, only with some insect attached to head or shoulder; nothing approaching to the fun of the rehearsal at Silverton, as indeed Fly had predicted. The only attempt at representation had cost Mysie more trouble than pleasure, for the training to dance together had been a difficult and wearisome business. Two of the grass-hoppers had been greatly displeased about it, and called it a beastly shame, words much shocking gentle Mysie from aristocratic lips. One of them had been as sulky, angry, and impracticable as possible, just like a log, and the other had consoled himself with all manner of tricks, especially upon the teacher and on Ivinghoe. He would skip like a real grasshopper, he made faces that set all laughing, he tripped Ivinghoe up, he uttered saucy speeches that Mysie considered too shocking to repeat, but which convulsed every one with laughter, Fly most especially, and her governess had punished her for it. 'She would not punish me,' said Mysie, 'though I know I was just as bad, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a shame!' At last the practising had to be carried on without the boys, and yet, {{when it came to the}} point, both the recusants behaved as well and danced as suitably as if they had submitted to the training like their sisters! And oh! the dressing, that was worse.|$|E
