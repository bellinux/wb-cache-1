40|$|This article {{examines}} the influence of cross-country differences on bank loan maturity for {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs), using a sample of 3366 SMEs from 19 European countries. It analyses a country's legal and institutional environment while controlling for banking structure, economic situation and firm-specific characteristics. The study finds that SMEs in countries that protect its creditors and enforce existing laws are more likely to obtain long-term bank debt. It also shows evidence that banks seem to rely more on the institutional environment when determining loan maturity for micro-firms than for medium-sized firms. Policymakers should take these findings into consideration when proposing policy changes that are likely to impact the legal or institutional environment.

40|$|A well-functioning economy {{requires}} a well-functioning bankruptcy system. However, {{our knowledge of}} insolvency and bankruptcy is remarkably limited. This anthology brings together new international research {{from a wide range}} of academic disciplines – law, business administration, economics, history and economic history – and there is a correspondingly broad range of themes in the volume. One theme running through the book involves institutional change in the systems that have been created to deal with insolvency. How have they <b>affected</b> <b>creditors</b> and debtors? How have they affected the economy? And how have older regulations been adapted to the demands of new economic systems and organizational innovations? Another theme involves how lawmakers and people in general have explained the causes of insolvency and how they have viewed insolvents. In classical antiquity, insolvency was regarded as equal to theft from the creditor. That remained the dominant view for many centuries, and insolvents were subjected to harsh treatment. Beginning in the 19 th century, there has been a process of redefinition, and bankruptcies are no longer regarded as a consequence of moral shortcomings but simply as economic failures...|$|R

For intermediate levels of creditor rights fully decentralized (centralized) borrowing structures are optimal if managers have strong (weak) empire building dencies. Decentralized borrowing is more attractive for companies focussing on short-term profitability. Credits are rather taken in countries with better creditor rights and more efficient insolvency systems. ...|$|R
40|$|Rules {{regulating}} a company's capital (legal capital rules) {{have traditionally}} been considered a creditor protection mechanism. More recently, however, commentators have suggested that legal capital rules are an ineffective and unnecessary form of creditor protection in developed economies, since the rules themselves are incapable of delivering the desired protection, and other strategies are available to provide what is necessary. These other strategies include directors' duties (of the creditor-regarding variety) and contractual mechanisms (enabling creditors to protect themselves contractually). In developed economies, {{the existence of these}} alternative strategies diminishes the need for a strict legal capital regime. The position might be different in developing economies. Do legal capital rules {{have a role to play}} in creditor protection in a transitional economy, where a comparable framework of creditor protection mechanisms is missing or under-developed. In light of the inadequacy of the ex post creditor protection framework in the transitional economy of Ukraine, the protection offered by the legal capital rules (however limited) emerges as a potentially useful collective guarantee against the opportunistic withdrawal of assets by corporate controllers. However, the practical effect of even such basic regimes is often compromised by the corporate environment in which the regime operates. Underdeveloped market mechanisms, non-transparent ownership structures and weak judicial credibility can adversely <b>affect</b> <b>creditor</b> protection. In such an environment, pressure to deliver functional convergence by way of voluntary corporate governance codes, international organisations' initiatives, and training in international judicial standards can be effective in helping to move forward the necessary changes by bearing on the acceptance of best practices and ethics...|$|R

40|$|Companies can {{optimize}} {{their corporate}} structure {{by changing the}} structure itself. Since a change to the structure may adversely affect the position of creditors, statutory protection is appropriate. Too much protection can unnecessarily prevent a change to the structure being made. Too little protection can adversely <b>affect</b> <b>creditors</b> and the investment climate in general. This book is about {{the search for a}} balance between flexibility {{on the one hand and}} protection of creditors on the other hand, when implementing a legal merger, division or conversion with participation by a joint stock company. A legel merger (juridische fusie) is a legal act whereby a company acquires under universal title all the assets and liabilities of one or more other companies which cease to exist at the moment of the merger. The general rule is that the shareholders of the company or companies that cease(s) to exist become shareholders in the acquiring company. Division can take! the form of a split-up or a split-off. With a split-up, all the assets and liabilities of the company being divided are transferred under universal title to two or more existing or newly incorporated companies, and the company being divided ceases to exist. With a split-off, all or parts of the assets and liabilities are transferred to one or more existing or newly incorporated companies and the company being divided continues to exist. The general rule is that the shareholders of the company being divided become shareholders of the acquiring company or companies. Conversion is a less far-reaching change of structure compared to merger and division. An artificial person may be converted into another legal form. Conversion does not terminate the existence of the artificial person.

40|$|We {{review the}} period of the Latin American debt crisis in order to draw policy analogies from that {{experience}} for current U. S. credit securitization markets. During the earlier episode the Brady Plan used a zero-coupon U. S. Treasury security to provide a credit enhancement for the troubled assets. This revitalized the market for Latin American debt by: (1) ameliorating the dual solvency problem that <b>affected</b> both <b>creditors</b> and debtors, and (2) revealing asset prices as dominated by risk fundamentals rather than by short-run factors. The cost of the Brady plan was quite small relative to its social benefits. To address today’s problems in some U. S. securitization markets, we argue that U. S. policymakers could implement a related form of cash flow enhancement with the potential for achieving similar outcomes. Analyzing the Brady bond credit enhancement as applied to a class of today’s mortgage securities reveals that the optimal timing for the credit enhancement targets cash-flows that are somewhat distant from the present and its financial turmoil. An additional benefit of this, in both the Brady Bond case and under our proposal, is that the probability of the program sponsor needing to make payments associated with the enhancement is likely to be lower if the intervention is indeed effective. Hence, refining the timing of the suggested enhancements has two mutually-reinforcing beneficial effects; through this program, an optimally designed large-scale commitment can have a lower final cost for the tax-payer than a smaller one that is more likely to fail...|$|R

40|$|Domestic {{public debt}} issued by {{emerging}} markets has risen significantly relative to international debt in recent years. Some recent empirical evidence {{also suggests that}} sovereigns have defaulted differentially on debt held by domestic and external creditors. Standard models of sovereign debt, however, mainly focus on how the actions of foreign creditors influence default decisions of sovereigns. Contrasting this one-sided focus, this paper adds to a new theoretical literature that points {{at the possibility of}} default on domestic debt and the consequences of doing so. It presents a model of an emerging market economy in which the government can selectively default on its domestic or external debt obligations. The model shows that the differential ability of domestic and foreign creditors to punish the government creates a gap in the expected default costs to the sovereign, and hence a differential in its propensity to default on its domestic versus foreign debt. The extent to which the possibility of differential treatment of <b>creditors</b> <b>affects</b> the composition of debt is explored. It shows that a country characterized by volatile output, sovereign risk, and costly tax collection will want to borrow in domestic markets as well as in international capital markets. The optimal allocation of debt between domestic and foreign creditors can thus be viewed as the government's purchase of insurance against macroeconomic shocks that affect its budget.

40|$|Abstract: A {{growing number}} of studies are {{focusing}} attention on the new bank resolution framework and, particularly, on its side effects. This paper intends {{to contribute to the}} limited literature by examining the first application of the BRRD in Italy, in 2015, to four small to medium-sized failing banks. It assesses empirically the (in) stability of bank creditors and depositors in stress situations. It analyses a unique proprietary database of the Italian Deposit Guarantee Scheme. It finds that the resolved banks incurred a significant loss of total funding since the start of their Special Administration procedure. When resolution is impending, creditors and depositors take flight dramatically. The run-off is stronger for uninsured deposits than for insured deposits. It also reveals that the deposits of some banks that are solvent but which send public signals of weakness (capital shortfall) seem to become “infected” and behave in a similar fashion. The results would seem to confirm that market discipline in fact does work. However, they also support the argument that resolution works best when the crisis is not systemic. In the presence of a systemic crisis the funding outflows can reasonably reach large proportions. They can weaken market confidence and <b>affect</b> other bank <b>creditors</b> with all the adverse knock-on effects on financial stability. If the bail-in logic can be counterproductive in those very situations for which it was conceived, it could imply that the risk of having to resort to bail-out is still very high...|$|R

40|$|Title: The {{implementation}} of valuation of tangible and financial assets to fair value – {{and its effects}} on the creditor protection Course: Bachelor theses in business accounting, 10 Swedish credits Author: Sam Espeland Advisor: Ogi Chun Key words: IAS 16, 39, 40, fair value, creditor protection, equity Purpose: The purpose with the essay is to examine how the {{implementation of}} the IAS standards that regard valuation to fair value, effects the equity and how the effects on equity <b>affects</b> the <b>creditor</b> protection. Methodology: The essay is using both a quantitative and a qualitative approach in which the quantitative part constitutes of data collection from annual reports and the qualitative part constitutes of interviews. Theoretical perspective: The theory gives a thorough understanding in how the IAS standards are designed, furthermore the procedure at liquidation and lack of capital is being treated, moreover some relevant terms and concepts are being treated. Empirical foundation: This chapter is divided into two parts, in one part the results from the quantitative approach is being presented in diagram form, and in the other part the interviews are being presented. Conclusions: The implementation will give a higher equity for most real estate companies, but likely also for example the mining industry. The creditor protection will likely be worsened among the industries that experience an increase in equity since their activities may proceed for a longer time before they have to be liquidated. Syfte: Syftet med uppsatsen är att undersöka hur införandet av IAS standarder som rör värdering till verkligt värde, påverkar eget kapital och hur detta i sin tur påverkar borgenärsskyddet. Metod: Uppsatsen använder sig av både ett kvantitativt och ett kvalitativt upplägg där den kvantitativa delen utgörs av datainsamling från årsredovisningar och den kvalitativa delen utgörs av intervjuer. Teoretiskt perspektiv: Teorin ger en ingående kunskap i hur IAS standarderna är utformade, dessutom behandlas förfarandet vid likvidation och kapitalbrist, vidare behandlas en del relevanta termer och begrepp. Empiri: Empirin är uppdelad i två delar, i den ena delen redovisas resultatet av den kvantitativa ansatsen i diagramform, och i den andra delen redovisas utförda intervjuer. Slutsatser: Implementeringen av relevanta IAS standarder ger ett ökat eget kapital för fastighetsbranschen men sannolikt även för t ex. gruvbolag. Borgenärsskyddet kommer sannolikt försämras bland de branscher där eget kapital ökar, eftersom deras verksamhet kan fortgå under en längre tid innan de måste träda i likvidation...|$|R
40|$|LL. M. (Commercial Law) South African {{company law}} has seen many changes {{in respect of}} {{corporate}} rescue, due to inter alia globalisation, increase in open trade, instant and freer communication {{and the need for}} better regulation of companies and stakeholders. As a result, the previous rescue mechanism of judicial management was widely criticised and poorly implemented. The Companies Act 71 of 20081 has however now replaced judicial management with business rescue. Business rescue encompasses many facets, most importantly the moratorium in section 133. Section 133 has already, and will even more so in future, have a dramatic impact on the launching or continuation of any legal or enforcement proceedings against a company undergoing business rescue, the status and enforceability of its contracts and the rights of <b>affected</b> parties (ie <b>creditors,</b> shareholders and directors). This study will discuss the general nature and effects of rescue moratoria and the moratoria (or lack thereof) created under the Companies Act 61 of 1973, 2 the 2008 Companies Act and the administration procedure in England. The moratorium under each relevant rescue procedure will be analysed according to its purpose, nature, effects and procedure. As such, this study will attempt to set out why the section 133 moratorium is the cornerstone to the business rescue procedure and vital in securing the turnaround of the company. The section 133 moratorium will, to a great extent, determine whether business rescue is a saving grace in South Africa.

40|$|The World Bank and the IMF have {{encouraged}} many {{less developed countries}} (LDCs) to pursue privatisation policies. Development economists and World Bank reports claim this facilitates development by improving controls within enterprises and external regulation of financial markets acting on external accounting reports. This paper questions these beliefs. It compares the post-privatisation performance of companies in Bangladesh examined in a World Bank report with the authors' own research on the same companies. The World Bank report reported {{that the success of}} the privatisations established the case for more. In the research reported here, only one of the privatised companies was judged a commercial success, though the unavailability and dubious accuracy of accounting reports prevented any definitive assessment. Above all, the paper questions the narrow criteria adopted by the World Bank report - namely profitability - and the neglect of employment conditions, trade union and individual rights; social returns; and financial transparency and accountability to external constituents. Our evidence suggested that privatisation has not increased returns to society: privatised companies' contributions to state revenue declined in real terms and as a proportion of value added. Transparent external reports failed to materialise as required by law and there was evidence of untoward transactions <b>affecting</b> minority shareholders, <b>creditors,</b> and tax collecting institutions. Internal controls may have become more comm ercial but at the cost of declining employment, wages, quality of working life, and employee rights. The World Bank claims rest upon efficiency benefits trickling down to all but the effects of privatisation may have been a redistribution of power and wealth to the new owners. This paper argues that the IMF, the World Bank, and Western capitalist states have not provided the technical infrastructure and organisational capacity to execute their neo-liberal privatisation agenda, which rests on dubious socio-economic assumptions. Our unfavourable evaluation of privatisation in Bangladesh is not unique. It has been happening again and again around the world. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. In 1926, the South African Parliament {{introduced}} a procedure known as judicial management. It was {{housed in the}} Companies Act 46 of 1926 (hereafter Companies Act 1926). The purpose of judicial management was to enable a failing company to restructure thus providing an alternative to liquidation. Companies {{play an important role}} in an economy and their demise <b>affects</b> not only <b>creditors</b> but also different groups of people that have a working relationship with the company. These include employees, suppliers, shareholders and other stakeholders. The legislature recognised the need to save this relationship in as far as was possible. They attempted to do so by amongst other things, providing for judicial management. Judicial management provided breathing space to companies on the brink of collapse in order to allow them to re-organise their affairs. It tried to achieve this by providing for a moratorium against creditors, divesting the control of the company from previous management who assumedly had run it aground, and by providing for the appointment of a judicial manager who attempted to turn the company around. Due to several factors, judicial management was not much of a success as will be discussed in this paper. Some of the reasons are related to weaknesses in the legislation, the attitude of the courts and in my view, the lack of local precedents initially, for the courts to follow (seeing that judicial management was the first of its kind in South African law) as well as companies themselves, who might have lacked an idea of how the procedure was to be utilised. In order to address the shortfalls in the legislation, a number of amendments were made through the years. One such shortfall was the fact that many companies that applied for judicial management had no real chance of rehabilitation and only did so to avoid a liquidation that was subject to the winding-up provisions of the 1926 Act. Some notable amendments that were made include those in 1932 under s 196 (1) that provided for a moratorium to be placed on all actions against the company while it was undergoing judicial management. Section 197 (A) introduced the concept of voidable dispositions as it applied in insolvency law. This provision aimed to ensure that companies did not apply for judicial management because they did not want the company to be wound up subject to the rules of insolvency law...|$|R
40|$|The 2008 {{financial}} crisis made clear the shortcomings in the European structure of financial supervision. In the cur­rent system of financial supervision the financial supervi­sor {{of the home}} Member State is in principle the only autho­rity entitled to supervise financial institutions even in case the institution operates across borders. If the home financial supervisor does not effectively supervise the financial insti­tution, this failure could <b>affect</b> clients and <b>creditors</b> in other Member States. The bankruptcy of Icelandic banks was felt by accountholders in the United Kingdom and the Nether­lands. The shortcomings in the Icelandic Deposit Guaran­tee scheme 1 threatened to expose these depositors to losses on their savings {{that should have been}} covered by that sche­me. In the end, the UK and the Dutch government guaran­teed these deposits under the applicable deposit-guarantee scheme. However, the problems arising in the execution of the agreement concluded between the UK, Dutch and Icel­andic government to recover the UK and Dutch taxpayers’ money from Iceland show the enormous consequences of failure in local supervision. Despite their significant relevan­ce in the current crisis, in this article I will not address these problems in micro-prudential supervision of banks. This ar­ticle focuses on the mechanism to ensure consistent applica­tion by the different national supervisors of the harmonised set of conduct of business rules, in particular, the rules laid down in the Prospectus Directive 20032 and the Transparen­cy Directive 2004. 3 In order to solve the shortcomings in the European struc­ture of financial supervision, the European Commission pro­posed to create a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS) consisting of national supervisors and three new su­pranational European Supervisory Authorities. A Superviso­ry Authority for the banking sector 4, one for the insurance and pensions sector 5 and a supranational European Supervi­sory Authority to ensure compliance by financial institutions with conduct of business rules and the orderly functioning of the securities market. 6 The national financial supervisors remain the principal supervisory authorities. However, the supranational authorities will get decisive authority in case of emergency or continued non-agreement between national supervisors. In these cases the supranational authorities will have the authority to address directly financial institutions that do not comply with the European financial services and financial supervision legislation. In this article I will analyse in paragraph 2 the current struc­ture of financial supervision.

A tarefa torna-se ainda mais árdua, pois a intercorrência não foi disciplinada de forma expressa pela legislação em vigor, nem tampouco recebeu detidas abordagens doutrinárias. Sob nosso enfoque, na execução fiscal, as normas que versem sobre a prescrição, intercorrente ou não, devem conformar-se com os seguintes fundamentos: direito do ente público, assim como de qualquer credor, à satisfação de seu crédito através de uma execução efetiva; destinação dos valores cobrados ao custeio das atividades estatais, voltadas à realização do bem comum; direito daquele que não é devedor à segurança jurídica decorrente da expectativa criada pela consolidação da situação no tempo, dificultando a comprovação da inexistência do débito; direito do devedor à segurança jurídica decorrente da expectativa criada pela consolidação da situação no tempo ou pela impossibilidade de pagamento decorrente da pobreza. Nesse último caso, preserva-se, também, a garantia da dignidade da pessoa humana; garantia da segurança jurídica a toda a coletividade, decorrente da estabilização de situações consolidadas pelo tempo, em atenção à máxima {{interest}} rei publicae ut sit finis litium. Emprega-se a expressão prescrição intercorrente em execução fiscal para designar a situação na qual a prescrição, anteriormente interrompida pela citação do devedor ou pelo despacho do juiz que ordená-la, volta a correr no curso do processo, nele completando o seu prazo. Trata-se da mesma prescrição prevista no CTN, no Código Civil, que pode voltar a fluir no curso da execução fiscal, geralmente em virtude da inércia do exeqüente em fazer uso dos poderes, das faculdades e dos deveres inerentes ao exercício do direito de ação. A inércia do credor em praticar seus deveres processuais e a potencialização dos males causados pela situação de eterna litispendência e litigiosidade fazem ressurgir na execução fiscal as razões pacificadoras e estabilizadoras da prescrição. Trata-se de encontrar termo razoável para preenchermos as imensas lacunas deixadas pelo legislador pátrio. This dissertation focuses in {{the phenomena}} {{that takes place}} in the Brazilian tax foreclosure (execução fiscal), called prescrição intercorrente. It means a limitation of claim during the procedure, when it takes too long, and the long lapse of times suggests a certain indifference {{on the part of the}} creditor towards his claim, or even if the creditor cant satisfy his credit due to the debtor insolvency. As said by Reinhard Zimmermann, in the most kenned study of prescription and limitations of claim in comparative law, if the creditor institutes an action on his claim, does what law of prescription expects him to do, both in the public interest and in the interest of his debtor: he takes the initiative to bring about an authoritative decision on the dispute (in Comparative Foundations of a European Law of Set-Off and Prescription, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 117). But in Brazilian tax foreclosure (execução fiscal) – which is a special procedural execution, which takes place in the Judiciary, the prescription (limitation of claim) can happens <b>affecting</b> even the <b>creditor</b> that has brought a claim against the debtor in a short period of time, adopting the behavior expected by Law. But the position of the creditor in Brazilian tax foreclosure (execução fiscal) demands that he makes more than just proposing an action against his debtor. Even if the execution is proposed by a State, to claim taxes, witch will be spent in the public interest; the Brazilian execução fiscal is not moved by judicial official impulse. The creditor, as in any other kind of execution in Brazil, has a cargo, an obligation to seek for assets or even for the debtor if he is raiding. If the creditor doesn’t pursue his interest, requiring the judicial acts necessary to bring the execution to expected end, which is the enforced satisfaction of his credit, it suggests a certain indifference on the part of the creditor towards his claim. The same reasons well kenned as the meaning reason for the existence of the limitation of claims (prescription in the continental law) are removed, and this time with a higher level due to the enormous entropy caused by the long pendency of the judicial action. So, the problem is solved in Brazilian execução fiscal by the possibility of declaring the prescription during the procedural. This phenomenon receives the name o prescrição intercorrente in Brazilian doctrine and jurisprudence. It must be said, the prescription in Brazilian Taxation Law causes the extinction not only of the action, but of the credit itself (as disposed in art. 156, V, CTN). The meaning of this work is to study the phenomenon of intercorrente prescription; witch has been neglected by the doctrine as well by the jurisprudence in this country. The method adopted in this dissertation is seeking for answers in the ground of the institute - meanly in the constitutional values involved - witch has surfed severe transformations by the Brazilian legislation during the last years. The answer to the questions that are daily brought in the enormous numbers of execuções fiscais existing in Brazil (that overloads the judiciary system) about the intercorrente prescription (or limitation of claims, in the common law) must be found not only in de ground of this institute. Special attention must be paid to the closed relation between the phenomenon of intercorrência, the results the extinction of the tax credit (phenomena occurred in the sphere of the material law), with the reality of the Brazilian “tax enforced execution” (discipline in the federal statute n. 6830 / 80), {{that takes place in}} the procedural sphere...|$|R
