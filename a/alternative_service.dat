5|$|After World War I, {{and with}} another European war looming, {{leaders from the}} {{historic}} peace churches met to strategize about how {{to cooperate with the}} government to avoid the difficulties of World War I. Holding a common view that any participation in military service was not acceptable, they devised a plan of civilian <b>alternative</b> <b>service,</b> based on experience gained by American Friends Service Committee work in Europe during and after World War I and forestry service done by Russian Mennonites in lieu of military service in Tsarist Russia.|$|E

25|$|Since 1992 Conservative (Masorti) {{services}} {{have been held}} as an <b>alternative</b> <b>service</b> usually in the Neuweg, the smaller second synagogue within Temple Emanuel, Woollahra, Sydney. In 1999, Kehilat Nitzan, Melbourne's first Conservative (Masorti) Congregation was established, with foundation president Prof John Rosenberg. The congregation appointed its first rabbi, Ehud Bandel in 2006. In 2010 Beit Knesset Shalom became Brisbane's first Conservative (Masorti) synagogue.|$|E
25|$|In April 1917—days {{after the}} United States joined World War I by declaring war on Germany and its allies—a group of Quakers met in Philadelphia {{to discuss the}} pending {{military}} draft and how it would affect members of peace churches such as Quakers, Mennonites, Brethren, and the Amish. They developed ideas for <b>alternative</b> <b>service</b> {{that could be done}} directly in the battle zones of northern France.|$|E
25|$|On 17 August an {{additional}} motorbus service was commenced from Clinton Street to Sneinton Dale. The decision to operate followed an application {{by a local}} operator to run a similar service. A 30-minute headway was operated at off-peak periods, increased to 15 minutes at peak periods. In September, an <b>alternative</b> <b>service</b> to Beeston was instituted via University Boulevard. In view of the operation of motorbuses along Hucknall Lane and to Beeston, powers in respect of tramway operation along these routes were allowed to lapse.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} soldiers wore {{uniforms and}} lived in barracks under military discipline, but {{were not required to}} bear arms and received no combat training. In theory, they were to be used only for civilian construction projects. The GDR therefore became the only Warsaw Pact country to provide a non-combat alternative for conscientious objectors. However, fearing that other soldiers would be contaminated by pacifist ideas, the government took care to segregate the construction units from regular conscripts. Moreover, conscripts who chose the <b>alternative</b> <b>service</b> option often faced discrimination later in life, including denial of opportunities for higher education.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to conducting <b>alternative</b> <b>service</b> programs for COs, AFSC collected {{relief in the}} form of food, clothing, and other supplies for displaced persons in France. Quakers were asked to collect old and make new clothing; to grow fruits and vegetables, can them, and send them to AFSC headquarters in Philadelphia. AFSC then shipped the materials to France for distribution. The young men and women sent to work in France, working with British Quakers, provided relief and medical care to refugees, repaired and rebuilt homes, helped farmers replant fields damaged by the war, and founded a maternity hospital.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of the Swiss militia system stipulates that the soldiers keep their own personal equipment, including all personally assigned weapons, at home (until 2007 this also included ammunition). Compulsory military service applies to all male Swiss citizens, with women serving voluntarily. Males usually receive initial orders {{at the age of}} 18 for military conscription eligibility screening. About two-thirds of young Swiss men are found suitable for service, while <b>alternative</b> <b>service</b> exists for those found unsuitable. Annually, approximately 20,000 persons are trained in basic training for a duration from 18 to 21 weeks (increased from 15 weeks, in 2003).|$|E

25|$|The {{effect of}} the failure of the 1928 book was salutary: no further {{attempts}} were made to revise the Book of Common Prayer. Instead a different process, that of producing an alternative book, led to the publication of Series 1, 2 and 3 in the 1960s, the 1980 <b>Alternative</b> <b>Service</b> Book and subsequently to the 2000 Common Worship series of books. Both differ substantially from the Book of Common Prayer, though the latter includes in the Order Two form of the Holy Communion a very slight revision of the prayer book service, largely along the lines proposed for the 1928 Prayer Book. Order One follows the pattern of modern liturgical scholarship.|$|E
25|$|The {{group was}} {{organized}} as National Council for Religious Conscientious Objectors on October 5, 1940 {{by the three}} historic peace churches {{in response to the}} Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, which introduced the first peacetime draft in the United States. The Selective Service Act provided for work of national importance and an alternative to military service for conscientious objectors. The immediate task of this group was to advise conscientious objectors and create a structure for the proposed <b>alternative</b> <b>service.</b> On November 26, 1940, National Council for Religious Conscientious Objectors was merged with a similar organization, Civilian Service Board to become National Service Board for Religious Objectors (NSBRO).|$|E
25|$|The <b>Alternative</b> <b>Service</b> Book 1980 (ASB) was {{the first}} {{complete}} prayer book produced by the Church of England since 1662. Its name derives {{from the fact that}} it was proposed not as a replacement for the Book of Common Prayer (BCP) but merely as an alternative to it. In practice, it was so popular that the various printers had to produce several editions very quickly and churches which retained the BCP drew attention to this fact as something to be noted. The Prayer Book Society was soon complaining that it was becoming hard to find a church which used the old prayer book and that theological colleges were not introducing students to it. It has now been replaced by Common Worship.|$|E

25|$|They also {{developed}} plans {{for dealing with}} the United States Army, since it had been inconsistent in its dealing with religious objectors to previous wars. Although legally members of pacifist churches were exempt from the draft, individual state draft boards interpreted the law in a variety of ways. Many Quakers and other COs were ordered to report to army camps for military service. Some COs, unaware of the significance of reporting for duty, found that this was interpreted by the military as willingness to fight. One of AFSC's first tasks was to identify CO's, find the camps where they were located, and then visit them to provide spiritual guidance and moral support. In areas where the pacifist churches were more well known (such as Pennsylvania), a number of draft boards were willing to assign COs to AFSC for <b>alternative</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
500|$|Civilian Public Service {{created a}} {{precedent}} for the <b>Alternative</b> <b>Service</b> Program for conscientious objectors in the United States during the Korean and Vietnam Wars.

500|$|The {{structure}} of the Swiss militia system stipulates that the soldiers keep their Army issued equipment, including all personal weapons, at home. Some organisations and political parties find this practice controversial but mainstream Swiss opinion is in favour of the system. Compulsory military service concerns all male Swiss citizens; women can serve voluntarily. Men usually receive military conscription orders for training {{at the age of}} 18. About two thirds of the young Swiss are found suited for service; for those found unsuited, various forms of <b>alternative</b> <b>service</b> exist. Annually, approximately 20,000 persons are trained in recruit centres for a duration from 18 to 21 weeks. The reform [...] "Army XXI" [...] was adopted by popular vote in 2003, it replaced the previous model [...] "Army 95", reducing the effectives from 400,000 to about 200,000. Of those, 120,000 are active in periodic Army training and 80,000 are non-training reserves.|$|E

500|$|Central to Franklin's pacifism and {{her view}} of life is what she calls [...] "the Quaker vision of the world". Individual {{conscience}} {{is at the heart}} of that vision. So too, is the need to discern appropriate ways of working for peace in each time and place [...] "rather than relying on a dogma of unvarying rules of conduct". She notes that for more than 300 years, Quakers have opposed war and violence and have objected to military service and conscription. They have worked on reconciliation, peace research and disarmament and in many countries have won the right for conscientious objectors to perform <b>alternative</b> <b>service</b> instead of taking part in war. Franklin remarks that Quaker principles have not changed, but technology has changed the nature of war. In a modern technological society she argues, there is no longer a clear boundary between war and peace. War planning is constant during peacetime and when wars are fought, women and children become targets. Nations no longer depend primarily on conscripting military recruits, but rely on advanced weapons systems that are costly to build or acquire. She writes that the arms race is driven by a [...] "technological imperative" [...] which requires the creation of an enemy as a permanent social institution: ...|$|E
2500|$|There was, at first, no <b>alternative</b> <b>service</b> for {{conscientious}} objectors. This {{changed in}} 1964 when, {{under pressure from}} the national Protestant church, the GDR's National Defense Council authorized the formation of Baueinheiten (construction units) for men of draft age who [...] "refuse military service with weapons on the grounds of religious viewpoints or for similar reasons".|$|E
