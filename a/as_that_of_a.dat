5|$|Other animals, {{including}} {{whales and}} elephants have larger brains than humans. However, when the brain-to-body mass ratio is taken into account, {{the human brain}} is almost twice as large <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bottlenose dolphin, and three times as large <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chimpanzee. However, a high ratio does not of itself demonstrate intelligence: very small animals have high ratios and the treeshrew has the largest quotient of any mammal.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} {{difference}} between the brains of mammals and other vertebrates {{is in terms of}} size. On average, a mammal has a brain roughly twice as large <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bird of the same body size, and ten times as large <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reptile of the same body size.|$|E

5|$|Crane later becomes {{suspicious}} when {{he realizes}} the diagram made by Katrina he thought summoned the Horseman is {{really one of}} protection, and also that the corpse of Lady Van Tassel has a wound {{that seems to have}} been caused post-mortem. The corpse is revealed <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> servant when Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) emerges alive to ambush Katrina. Lady Van Tassel tells Katrina that her family was driven from their ancestral home by the Van Garretts, who then sold it to the Van Tassels. She proceeded to pledge her soul to Satan and become a witch, summoning the Horseman to kill Van Garrett, his son, new wife, unborn child, and every villager who knew about his new will, marriage, and child, {{in order to be able}} to claim everything that she deemed to be rightfully hers uncontested. She then sends the Horseman after Katrina to remove the last obstacle to inheriting the combined Van Garrett and Van Tassel estates.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being more}} powerfully built than other large cats, Smilodon had a weaker bite. Modern big cats have more {{pronounced}} zygomatic arches, while these were smaller in Smilodon, which restricted the thickness and therefore {{power of the}} temporalis muscles and thus reduced Smilodons bite force. Analysis of its narrow jaws indicates that it could produce a bite only a third as strong <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lion. There {{seems to be a}} general rule that the saber-toothed cats with the largest canines had proportionally weaker bites. Analyses of canine bending strength (the ability of the canine teeth to resist bending forces without breaking) and bite forces indicate that the saber-toothed cats' teeth were stronger relative to the bite force than those of modern big cats. In addition, Smilodons gape could have reached almost 120 degrees, while that of the modern lion reaches 65 degrees. This made the gape wide enough to allow Smilodon to grasp large prey despite the long canines.|$|E

5|$|Musically speaking, Hate {{is notable}} for its stripped-down, {{straightforward}} approach {{and the use}} of a drum machine, the latter sparking some controversy. Lamounier claimed to have no qualms about using this device, on the basis that most death metal drummers use trigger pads for recording purposes, which in the end produces the same homogenized sound <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> drum machine.|$|E
5|$|Rome's {{control over}} the city ended {{following}} {{the chaos of the}} Crisis of the Third Century, when the empire nearly disintegrated as a series of generals seized and lost power through civil wars, palace coups and assassinations. Around 280, Roman rule collapsed in much of Mauretania and was never re-established.In 285, the emperor Diocletian reorganised {{what was left of the}} province to retain only the coastal strip between Lixus, Tingis and Septa (modern Ceuta). Although a Roman army was based in Tingis, it was decided that it would simply be too expensive to mount a reconquest of a vulnerable border region. Occupation of the city continued, however, as fine mosaics such <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chariot race conducted by animals in the House of Venus can not have been created earlier than the fourth century. The end of the Roman city probably came in the form of an earthquake towards the end of the century, which buried numerous bronze statues in the wreckage of the houses.|$|E
5|$|The king cheetah is {{a variety}} of cheetah with a rare {{mutation}} for cream-coloured fur marked with large, blotchy spots and three dark, wide stripes extending from their neck to the tail. In 1926 Major A.Cooper wrote about an animal he had shot near modern-day Harare. Describing the animal, he noted its remarkable similarity to the cheetah, but the body of this individual was covered with fur as thick <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> snow leopard and the spots merged to form stripes. He suggested {{that it could be}} a cross between a leopard and a cheetah. After further similar animals were discovered, it was established they were similar to the cheetah in having non-retractable clawsa characteristic feature of the cheetah.|$|E

5|$|The male {{selects a}} territory, which he defends against conspecifics, and re-establishes a pair bond with his mate or attracts a new female if necessary. Courtship {{involves}} ritualised flight and ground displays, {{and the male}} often presents a fish to his partner. Most species {{have little or no}} nest, laying the eggs onto bare ground, but Trudeau's tern, Forster's tern and the marsh terns construct floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats. Black and lesser noddies build nests of twigs, feathers and excreta on tree branches, and brown, blue, and grey noddies make rough platforms of grass and seaweed on cliff ledges, in cavities or on other rocky surfaces. The Inca tern nests in crevices, caves and disused burrows, such <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Humboldt penguin. The white tern is unique in that it lays its single egg on a bare tree branch.|$|E
5|$|Their {{sense of}} smell, while {{much better than}} that of humans, {{is not quite as}} good <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dog. It is {{believed}} to {{play a key role in}} the social interactions of horses as well as detecting other key scents in the environment. Horses have two olfactory centers. The first system is in the nostrils and nasal cavity, which analyze a wide range of odors. The second, located under the nasal cavity, are the Vomeronasal organs, also called Jacobson's organs. These have a separate nerve pathway to the brain and appear to primarily analyze pheromones.|$|E
5|$|There are two breeds of Welsh Corgis, the Cardigan and the Pembroke, each {{named for}} the county in Wales where it originated. The dogs share several similar traits, such as their coats, which are water {{resistant}} and shed on average twice a year. The body of the Cardigan is slightly longer {{than that of the}} Pembroke; both breeds have short legs, placing their bodies close to the ground. But they are not as square in outline as a typical Terrier, or have an elongated body as great <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Dachshund. There are only minor differences {{in the shape of the}} head, both appear fox-like. The head of a Cardigan Welsh Corgi is typically larger than that of an equivalent Pembroke, and has a larger nose. It can take a few days following birth for the true colour of a Corgi's coat to appear, and this is particularly evident in those with tricolour or black and tan markings.|$|E
5|$|The neck {{vertebra}} {{referred to}} Hatzegopteryx sp. contains <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> traits <b>that</b> allow {{for it to}} be definitely identified <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> azhdarchid. The centrum is relatively low, the zygapophyses are large and flattened, and the preserved portions of the neural spine indicate that it is bifid, or split into two.|$|R

30|$|The {{operating}} {{units are}} prone to failure and have the life time exponentially distributed with mean 1 /λ.

5|$|They have a {{moderately}} long single coat with no undercoat. Feathering of the fur {{appears on the}} chest, belly, ears and {{on the back of}} the legs. The coat is not as heavy <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Cocker Spaniel but will require grooming in order to prevent mats from appearing in the fur. Docked tails were often used in working dogs, as poor blood flow left healing of the non docked tail difficult.|$|E
5|$|Whisky Galore! was {{released}} into UK cinemas on 16 June 1949; {{the film was}} financially successful.

In France, the film was retitled Whisky à gogo; the name was later used <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> discothèque in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Clarinet {{bodies have}} been made {{from a variety of}} {{materials}} including wood, plastic, hard rubber, metal, resin, and ivory. The vast majority of clarinets used by professionals are made from African hardwood, mpingo (African Blackwood) or grenadilla, rarely (because of diminishing supplies) Honduran rosewood and sometimes even cocobolo. Historically other woods, notably boxwood, were used. Most inexpensive clarinets are made of plastic resin, such as ABS. Resonite is Selmer's trademark name for its type of plastic. Metal soprano clarinets were popular in the early 20th century until plastic instruments supplanted them; metal construction is still used for the bodies of some contra-alto and contrabass clarinets and the necks and bells of nearly all alto and larger clarinets. Ivory was used for a few 18th-century clarinets, but it tends to crack and does not keep its shape well. Buffet Crampon's Greenline clarinets are made from a composite of grenadilla wood powder and carbon fiber. Such clarinets are less affected by humidity and temperature changes than wooden instruments but are heavier. Hard rubber, such as ebonite, has been used for clarinets since the 1860s, although few modern clarinets are made of it. Clarinet designers Alastair Hanson and Tom Ridenour are strong advocates of hard rubber. Hanson Clarinets of England manufactures clarinets using a grenadilla compound reinforced with ebonite, known as 'BTR' (bithermal reinforced) grenadilla. This material is also not affected by humidity, and the weight is the same <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wooden clarinet.|$|E

5|$|If a cat so chooses, {{they can}} take a {{different}} calling in life <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> medicine cat. Medicine cats, unlike warriors, serve for their clan not through bloodshed, but through peace. They are trained to heal their Clanmates by using the natural resources as medicines; for example, cobwebs {{can be used to}} stitch deep wounds, whilst poppy seeds are used to lull a distressed cat into sleep. They sleep separately, surrounded by the herbs and resources they need to keep their Clan safe and healthy. Medicine cat apprentices go through a longer period of training than warriors, due to the vast amount of knowledge they must remember. Medicine cats are also not allowed to take any mates or have any kits. This is because they must care for each member of their Clan equally; if they were to form a loving relationship with any one individual, they may unfairly place that cat’s life over that of the Clan. A Clan tends to have only one or two, and occasionally three, medicine cats at any given time.|$|E
5|$|Khandoba is also {{a figure}} of respect and worship to Muslims, and this {{affiliation}} is visible {{in the style of}} his temples. He is called Mallu or Ajmat Khan (Rautray) by Muslim devotees, and many times portrayed as being a Muslim himself in this context. The latter is believed to conferred upon by the Mughal invader king Aurangzeb, who was forced to flee from Jejuri by Khandoba's power. Some of these distinguishing Muslim features include his usual appearance <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Paṭhān on horseback, one of his wives being a Muslim, and that his horse-keeper is a Muslim in Jejuri. The Mārtaṇḍa Vijaya expressly states that his devotees are mainly Muslims. The worship of Khandoba had received royal patronage by Ibrahim II, which consisted of the reinstatement of the annual jatra and the right of pilgrims to perform rituals at the Naldurg temple. Malhari Mahatmya even records Muslims (mleccha) as the god's bhaktas (devotees), who call him as Malluka Pathan or Mallu Khan. In Jejuri, a Muslim family traditionally looks after the horses of the god.|$|E
5|$|While Totti was a {{prolific}} goalscorer, {{he was also}} renowned for his ball control, vision, creativity, and range of passing, {{as well as his}} ability to set the pace in midfield and provide through-balls and assists for his teammates, often through his trademark use of the no-look pass or backheel, in particular when holding up the ball or playing with his back to goal. Throughout his career, Totti drew particular praise from pundits for his excellent vision, technique, and precise long passing ability, which allowed him to play the ball first-time. Due to his movement and wide range of skills, his role has at times been described <b>as</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hardworking, generous, quick and dynamic centre forward, known as a centravanti di manovra in Italian. Known for his work rate, longevity, and willingness to contribute defensively, Totti underwent an athletic development during his time under Zeman: he undertook a muscle-strengthening programme to adapt to the rhythms of 21st-century football, gaining physical strength, stamina, fitness and shooting power to the detriment of some of his speed and agility, which also enabled him to maintain a consistent level of performance in his later career.|$|E
