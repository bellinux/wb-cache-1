40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} isolate empirically the {{productivity}} effect of offshoring on establishment employment (e. g. Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg, 2008) from a direct employment effect via downsizing. The analysis is pursued for {{a representative sample}} of German establishments from 1998 to 2004, using a difference-in-differences matching approach. First, we find a positive employment effect from a qualitative increase of foreign intermediate input usage (offshoring). Second, offshoring does not increase production depth. Hence, we conclude that <b>offshoring</b> <b>plants</b> predominantly substitute domestic for foreign inputs rather than replace their own production by <b>offshoring.</b> Third, <b>offshoring</b> <b>plants</b> increase their average productivity and thus their competitiveness relative to plants that do not offshore. Moreover, they gain domestic and foreign market share. This can explain the positive employment effect in <b>offshoring</b> <b>plants.</b> In a final step, we provide also evidence for employment losses through offshoring in the few cases when it is concomitant to restructuring of the plant...|$|R

40|$|A country's {{competitiveness}} and, in turn, its people's {{standard of}} living {{are linked to the}} involvement of its commercial sector in international business. The Hong Kong clothing-manufacturing industry {{is one of the key}} players in the world's fashion trade. The major objectives of this paper are to study how the manufacturers there are involved in global production and to develop a summary score for measuring the intensity of such involvement. Six modified global production involvement (GPI) indicators were identified from the literature and a logical and systematic approach was designed for the development of the score. Finally, a four-item sub-index, comprising location of <b>offshore</b> manufacturing <b>plants,</b> number of <b>offshore</b> manufacturing <b>plants,</b> length of <b>offshore</b> production experience and ownership of <b>offshore</b> <b>plants,</b> was successfully obtained, expressing the intensity of a firm's investment in global manufacturing facilities. The other two GPI indicators, propensity for offshore production and extent of offshore production networking were stand-alone, implying that the GPI of a firm should be viewed separately from three perspectives. These resulting measures can be used by other researchers to evaluate and compare specific countries' GPI as well as that of individual firms and to provide guidelines for firms to increase such involvement through adjusting the level of these measures.

40|$|We propose an {{endogenous}} growth model with offshoring to investigate {{its effects on}} product innovation and growth {{in the country of}} origin. Offshoring is associated with reduced feedback from <b>offshored</b> <b>plants</b> to domestic labs as well as coordination problems between the offshored and domestic divisions of firms. Production and transport cost parameters affect the static decision to relocate plants but not R&D. Hence, offshoring may be chosen by firms when it damages the growth rate of their countries of origin. In particular, if offshoring reduces the feedback from plants to labs, it is likely to bring dynamic losses when the countries of origin are large, especially in sectors in which R&D is cheap and product differentiation is strong. It is also likely to slow growth in sectors in which contractual incompleteness gives a strong bargaining power to offshored divisions in intra-firm transactions...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an off-design simulation of offshore combined cycles. Offshore installations {{have a substantial}} power demand to facilitate {{the oil and gas}} production. To cover this need of power almost all the platforms use one or several gas turbines, often described as a simple cycle. However, because of high taxes on emissions, and increasing gas prices, more efficient technologies have been reviewed. One solution has been installing combined cycles (CC) offshore. Between 1999 and 2000 three combined cycles were installed on the Norwegian continental shelf and are still in operation. A combined plant may operate for prolonged time at off-design conditions, depending on power demand, ambient condition offshore. First, this thesis gives a description of combined cycles from a thermodynamic and technical point of view. A study of existing offshore combined cycles is performed, and some of the implications of using combined cycles offshore are discussed. In the study, also off-design performance regarding the gas turbine and steam cycle is presented. Further, the simulation tool GTPRO is used to model two CC plants, one designed for offshore installations, and one designed to achieve high efficiency. As part of the design process a sensitivity analysis is performed to find a good trade-off between efficiency and weight for the <b>offshore</b> <b>plant.</b> The model showed good agreements compared with the existing <b>offshore</b> <b>plants,</b> with a power output of 50. 3 MW, plant efficiency of 50. 3 %, and similar weight of the skids. The high efficient plant, based on the same gas turbine, and the same assumptions produced 53. 1 MW. This model gained 2. 4 MW more in power output, however with a penalty of 209 ton in extra weight. To review the plants performance and operability, off-design simulations were performed in GTMASTER. Both part load and changing ambient temperature were investigated. The results showed that both plants had similar behavior in performance at off-design, and that the GT strongly dictates the behavior of the steam cycle. At part load the relative SC efficiency increases, resulting in general high plant efficiency. At 60 % GT load, the relative gas turbine efficiency is 81 % compared to the relative plant efficiencies of about 90 %. The difference in efficiency between the high efficient <b>plant</b> and the <b>offshore</b> <b>plant</b> remains constant at part load. The result from the simulations of ambient temperature is that none of plants will achieve higher plant gross efficiency at changing ambient temperature. The best plant efficiency occurs at design point. However, both plants have a long interval with approximately 100 % plant efficiency. From 15 to 0 &# 176;C, the relative SC gross efficiency drops with 5 %, and the relative GT efficiency increase with 2 %. However, the power output changes for both the GT and ST. From 28 &# 176;C to about 0 &# 176;C the power output increase almost linearly for the SC and GT. </p...|$|R
