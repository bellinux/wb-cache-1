25|$|The {{classification}} of fine-grained soils, i.e., soils that are finer than sand, is determined primarily by their <b>Atterberg</b> <b>limits,</b> not by their grain size. If {{it is important}} to determine the grain size distribution of fine-grained soils, the hydrometer test may be performed. In the hydrometer tests, the soil particles are mixed with water and shaken to produce a dilute suspension in a glass cylinder, and then the cylinder is left to sit. A hydrometer is used to measure the density of the suspension as a function of time. Clay particles may take several hours to settle past the depth of measurement of the hydrometer. Sand particles may take less than a second. Stoke's law provides the theoretical basis to calculate the relationship between sedimentation velocity and particle size. ASTM provides the detailed procedures for performing the Hydrometer test.|$|E

2500|$|The {{values of}} these limits {{are used in}} a number of ways. There is also a close {{relationship}} between the limits and properties of a soil such as compressibility, permeability, and strength. This is thought to be very useful because as limit determination is relatively simple, it is more difficult to determine these other properties. Thus the <b>Atterberg</b> <b>limits</b> are not only used to identify the soil's classification, but it [...] allows for the use of empirical correlations for some other engineering properties.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Atterberg</b> <b>limits</b> are a basic {{measure of}} the {{critical}} water contents of a fine-grained soil: its shrinkage limit, plastic limit, and liquid limit. As a dry, clayey soil takes on increasing amounts of water, it undergoes distinct changes in behavior and consistency. Depending on the water content of the soil, it may appear in four states: solid, semi-solid, plastic and liquid. In each state, the consistency and behavior of a soil is different and consequently so are its engineering properties. Thus, the boundary between each state can be defined based on {{a change in the}} soil's behavior. The <b>Atterberg</b> <b>limits</b> can be used to distinguish between silt and clay, and it can distinguish between different types of silts and clays. These limits were created by Albert Atterberg, a Swedish agriculturist. They were later refined by Arthur Casagrande. These distinctions in soil are used in assessing the soils that are to have structures built on. [...] Soils when wet retain water and some expand in volume. [...] The amount of expansion is related to the ability of the soil to take in water and its structural make-up (the type of atoms present). These tests are mainly used on clayey or silty soils since these are the soils that expand and shrink due to moisture content. [...] Clays and silts react with the water and thus change sizes and have varying shear strengths. Thus these tests are used widely in the preliminary stages of designing any structure to ensure that the soil will have the correct amount of shear strength and not too much change in volume as it expands and shrinks with different moisture contents.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS), silts and clays are {{classified}} by plotting {{the values of}} their plasticity index and liquid limit on a plasticity chart. [...] The A-Line on the chart separates clays (given the USCS symbol C) from silts (given the symbol M). LL=50% separates high plasticity soils (given the modifier symbol H) from low plasticity soils (given the modifier symbol L). [...] A soil that plots above the A-line and has LL>50% would, for example, be classified as CH. Other possible classifications of silts and clays are ML, CL and MH. [...] If the <b>Atterberg</b> <b>limits</b> plot in the"hatched" [...] region on the graph near the origin, the soils are given the dual classification 'CL-ML'.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this research}} are to determine the plasticity properties and the shear strength properties of lime treated soft clay. The physical properties and shear strength properties of lime treated soft clays are investigated by conducting laboratory test such as <b>atterberg</b> <b>limit</b> test and unconfined compression test. <b>Atterberg</b> <b>limit</b> test {{have been carried out}} for 7 days of curing period for the treated clay with the optimum lime content. For unconfined compressive test, the test have been carried out for 7, 14, and 28 days of curing period. For <b>atterberg</b> <b>limit,</b> there is an increment in both plastic and liquid limit of the lime treated soft clay and untreated soft clay. The liquid limits for untreated soil is 66. 5 % then increase into 73. 30 % when 20 % lime is added. The plastic limit for untreated soil sample is 34. 9 % before it increase to 38. 68 % for 20 % lime added respectably. This resulted an increment in plasticity index from 31. 55 % for untreated sample to 34. 62 % at 20 % lime. For unconfined compressive test, the result have shown that there is an increment for the axial stress based on the curing days. The maximum axial stress for the untreated clay is initially 158. 47 kN/m 2. After added with 20 % of lime content, the maximum axial stress is increased to 209. 21 kN/m 2 for 7 days of curing while for 14 and 28 days, the maximum axial stress are 231. 19 kN/m 2 and 352. 02 kN/m 2.

40|$|Abstract — Slope {{failures}} usually {{occur in}} Malaysia {{during the rainy}} season from the months of October to January annually causing damages to properties and fatalities. The common laboratory tests conducted to determine the soil characteristics include soil classification, moisture content, particle density, field bulk unit weight and <b>Atterberg</b> <b>limit</b> tests. In the case of <b>Atterberg</b> <b>limit</b> tests, only the silt and clay portions of the sandy soils were tested. Disturbed soil samples were collected from 10 slope failures in Baling and also from 19 slope failures in Penang. The slope failures in Penang are within the granitic residual soil while the slope failures in Baling are within the sedimentary residual soil. Field bulk density tests were carried out at all the locations where soil samples were taken. The objective of this research is to compare the characteristics of soils taken from slope failures within the granitic and sedimentary residual soils. The particle density and field bulk unit weight are very consistent at slope failures in both the sedimentary and granitic residual soils. In general, all the soil characteristics and properties found in this study are near or within the range that was found by earlier researchers for Malaysian residual soils...|$|R
2500|$|Soil {{samples are}} often {{categorized}} as being either [...] "disturbed" [...] or [...] "undisturbed;" [...] however, [...] "undisturbed" [...] samples are not truly undisturbed. A disturbed sample {{is one in}} which the structure of the soil has been changed sufficiently that tests of structural properties of the soil will not be representative of in-situ conditions, and only properties of the soil grains (e.g., grain size distribution, <b>Atterberg</b> <b>limits,</b> and possibly the water content) can be accurately determined. An undisturbed sample is one where the condition of the soil in the sample is close enough to the conditions of the soil in-situ to allow tests of structural properties of the soil to be used to approximate the properties of the soil in-situ.|$|E
2500|$|Although many {{naturally}} occurring deposits include both silts and clay, clays are distinguished from other fine-grained soils by differences {{in size and}} mineralogy. Silts, which are fine-grained soils that do not include clay minerals, tend to have larger particle sizes than clays. There is, however, some overlap in particle size and other physical properties. [...] The distinction between silt and clay varies by discipline. Geologists and soil scientists usually consider the separation to occur at a particle size of 2 µm (clays being finer than silts), sedimentologists often use 4–5 μm, and colloid chemists use 1 μm.

40|$|The {{black cotton soil}} {{is known}} as {{expansive}} type of soil which expands suddenly and start swelling when it comes in contact with moisture. Due to this property of soil the strength and other properties of soil are very poor. To improve its properties {{it is necessary to}} stabilize he soil by different stabilizers. Expansive type of soil shows unpredictable behavior with different kind of stabilizers. Soil stabilization is a process to treat a soil to maintain, alter or improve the performance of soil. In this study, the potential of burnt brick dust as stabilizing additive to expansive soil is evaluated for the improving engineering properties of expansive soil. The evaluation involves the determination of the swelling potential, linear shrinkage, <b>atterberg’s</b> <b>limits,</b> & compaction test of expansive soil in its natural state as well as when mixed with varying proportion of burnt brick dust (from 30 to 50 %).

With increasing amount of stabilizer swelling decreases. Maximum decrement in swelling has been noted in 50 % of replacement of soil by brick dust. Also by increasing stabilizing content linear shrinkage reduces. Maximum decrement in shrinkage has been noted in 50 % replacement of soil by stabilizer.

Preliminary tests were performed on three soil samples collected from Ile-Ife, Nigeria designated as sample A, B and C. <b>Atterberg’s</b> <b>limits</b> and some strength tests (compaction, California bearing ratio, and triaxial) were also performed on the samples at their unstabilized state, after which the samples were stabilized with lime in 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 % by weight of sample to determine the optimum lime percentage. The soil samples were further stabilized with lime-forage ash mixture using the optimum lime of each sample and varying forage ash additive in 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 %. <b>Atterberg’s</b> <b>limit</b> and other strength tests were repeated on the samples to observe the effects of the lime-forage ash combination on the soil geotechnical properties.
