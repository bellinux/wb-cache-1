40|$|Turbulence {{distances}} {{are a major}} {{design criteria}} {{in the design of}} new freeways and the modifications of freeways. In the Dutch freeway design guideline (NOA) turbulence distances are applied to determine the minimal distance between on-ramps and off-ramps to enter and exit the freeway, or to switch from the one freeway to the other, and lane drops. However, the origin of these values are unknown. In the meanwhile, these values are applied, while the pressure on the infrastructure system is increasing. Hopefully these values can be decreased by measuring the effect of discontinuities on the traffic flow. In this thesis an innovative method is developed to measure the general macroscopic effects on the mean speed, lane flow distribution and lane density by combining induction loop data of multiple freeway <b>acceleration</b> <b>lane</b> locations. This thesis focuses on the effect of acceleration lanes on the traffic flow by comparing the data of acceleration lanes with the data of locations without discontinuities. With this method little effects are found on the mean (lane) speed. In the lane flow distribution and lane density effects of the <b>acceleration</b> <b>lane</b> on the traffic flow are found. On the outside lane decreases the fraction of the flow and lane density just upstream of the <b>acceleration</b> <b>lane.</b> Further downstream, the fraction and lane density increases strongly until just downstream of the acceleration, and decreases back to the "normal" level. On the median lane the opposite behavior is found. Based on a rough estimation the effect of the <b>acceleration</b> <b>lane</b> is found 500 meter upstream and 800 meter downstream of the <b>acceleration</b> <b>lane.</b> Transport & PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{assess the}} safety impact of {{auxiliary}} lanes at downstream locations of U-turns, the Traffic Conflict Technique was used. On {{the basis of}} the installed components at those locations, four types of U-turns were identified: those without any auxiliary lane, those with an <b>acceleration</b> <b>lane,</b> those with outer widening, and those with both an <b>acceleration</b> <b>lane</b> and outer widening. The available crash data is unreliable, therefore to assess the level of road safety, Conflict Indexes were formulated to put more emphasis on severe crashes than on slight ones by using two types of weighting coefficients. The first coefficient was based on the subjective assessment of the seriousness of the conflict situation and the second was based on the relative speed and angle between conflicting streams. A comparatively higher Conflict Index value represents a lower level of road safety. According to the results, a lower level of road safety occurs if two components apply or if a location is without any auxiliary lane. The highest level of road safety occurs if the layout includes only a single component, either an <b>acceleration</b> <b>lane</b> or outer widening...|$|E
40|$|Acceleration lanes {{provide the}} access to freeways {{with the aim of}} {{improving}} traffic flow conditions and safety. Therefore, provision of an appropriate entrance ramp and <b>acceleration</b> <b>lane</b> geometry that allows the entering vehicle to accelerate to a speed closer to the main flow speed is crucial for comfortable and safe merging maneuvers. This paper presents an analysis of driver behavior on different acceleration lanes in various traffic conditions performed on an interactive driving simulator. Three different traffic volumes combined with two lengths of <b>acceleration</b> <b>lane</b> were simulated and their effects on driving performances have been studied. It has been observed that drivers’ behavior during merging maneuver is significantly influenced by traffic volume on the main lane and that the <b>acceleration</b> <b>lane</b> length does not show any significant effect on drivers’ speed, trajectories and accelerations. Particularly higher the traffic volume, longer the merging length of the driver as well as grater the acceleration oscillations and the number of gaps rejected. The general results show that the advanced techniques of driving simulation can disclose the relationships between road design parameters and behavioral aspects important to create safer road infrastructure. Further simulation studies are planned to confirm the findings and to strengthen and generalize the results...|$|E

The analysis {{demonstrated that the}} longer <b>acceleration</b> <b>lane</b> length is associated with further merging positions. Furthermore, the traffic conditions do not significantly affect the means of merging positions but their variations. The variations of merging positions become significant when the density of mainline is higher. A similar tendency can be observed if <b>acceleration</b> <b>lane</b> length becomes longer. Regarding merging speed, {{it is found that}} mainline traffic conditions significantly affect merging speeds. They decrease as traffic conditions become denser. To generalize the results of analysis, a normal distribution was adopted to fit the models of merging position and speed.

The interchange {{is also one of the}} narrower points of Highway 401's collector-express system, not just because of the bridges but also because of the suburbs east of Yonge Street (which forced the province to expropriate land in order to expand that segment of Highway 401).

50|$|An autovía {{is one of}} {{two classes}} of major highway in the Spanish road system similar to a British {{motorway}} or an American freeway. It is akin to the autopista, the other major highway class, but has fewer features and is never a toll road. Some distinguishing features of an autovía are that it must be divided by a median, it must have restricted access, and it cannot be crossed by other roads. While autopistas are generally new routes, autovías are normally improvements to existing roads, so they may have tighter curves and less safe accesses, often with shorter <b>acceleration</b> <b>lanes.</b> However, both have nominal speed limits of 120 km/h.

40|$|Acceleration and {{deceleration}} lanes are {{the critical}} parts which ensure safety maneuver between main lane and ramp. Due to terrain constraints, the left exit or left entry ramp {{used in the}} interchange design doesn’t accord with the right-hand driving habits and drivers’ expectations. To ensure the safety and efficiency of the operation, it’s necessary to study the safety length of the acceleration and deceleration lanes on left-side ramp considering the vehicles’ operating characteristic of merging or diverging. According to the headway distribution of main lane in merging area, the probability model of vehicles in the <b>acceleration</b> <b>lane</b> merged into the main lane was established based on the acceptance gap theory. The length of the <b>acceleration</b> <b>lane</b> can be calculated under the different operating speed and merging probabilities. Based on Secondary reduction theory, the required safety length of deceleration lane driving from the inner lane to the left-side exit ramp was determined to ensure that those diverging vehicles do not affect {{the operation of the}} vehicles on the main lanes.
