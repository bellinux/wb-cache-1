25|$|Clarke's {{spending}} {{had left}} Leeds in a precarious financial situation, and Gray {{was forced to}} concentrate on youth development to rebuild the team. Gray had no {{money to spend on}} team building, and those players he developed were often sold off as well. Young players to emerge during this period included Neil Aspin, Denis Irwin, John Sheridan, Scott Sellars and Bob Taylor – who all enjoyed considerable success at other clubs after leaving Leeds. The 1984–85 season saw Leeds take the promotion battle to the final game, but lost 1–0 away to Birmingham City. However, that game will be remembered for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> reasons by both clubs due to a high-profile hooliganism incident at St Andrew's stadium. Leeds fans rioted at the game, causing a wall to collapse and crushing a 14-year-old boy to death. 96 policemen were injured, hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of damage was caused by vandalism and graffiti, and the collapsed wall also crushed several parked motor vehicles beyond repair.|$|E
25|$|Ball's tenure saw City {{narrowly}} avoid relegation by finishing 20th in 1991–92 and 19th in 1992–93. In December 1992, {{part of the}} floodlights failed {{with just}} six minutes left in City's home FA Cup game against Swansea City. The Grecians were losing 2-1 at the time, and when the referee tried to restart the match with {{only half of the}} floodlights working, City fans invaded the pitch and sat in the goalmouth. Once they were removed, the match restarted once more, only for the floodlights to fail one minute later; after which the match was abandoned. City lost the rescheduled match 5-2. City again made the headlines at the end the 1992–93 season, this time for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> reasons. In the penultimate game of the season, City needed a win against Port Vale to avoid relegation. City were leading 1-0, but referee Bob Hamer awarded Port Vale a controversial penalty in stoppage time. The penalty was converted and, after the final whistle, City supporters invaded the pitch, the referee was knocked to the ground and one of the linesmen was assaulted. Manager Alan Ball also ran onto the pitch to remonstrate with Hamer and had to be pulled away by his backroom staff. The season did have a positive for City, as they completed a league double over rivals Plymouth Argyle.|$|E

Diodorus' statement about Greek valor to preserve their liberty is inserted in the film, but his mention of Persian valor is omitted.
