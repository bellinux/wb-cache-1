5|$|Ethylene glycol {{has been}} shown to be toxic to humans and is also toxic to {{domestic}} pets such as cats and dogs. A toxic dose requiring medical treatment varies but is considered more than 0.1 mL per kg body weight (mL/kg) of pure substance. That is roughly 16 mL of 50% ethylene glycol for an 80kg adult and 4 mL for a 20kg child. Poison control centers often use more than <b>a</b> <b>lick</b> or taste in a child or more than a mouthful in an adult as a dose requiring hospital assessment.|$|E

25|$|Too much licking of wounds can be harmful. An Elizabethan collar is {{sometimes}} worn by pet animals to prevent biting or excessive wound licking, {{which can cause}} <b>a</b> <b>lick</b> granuloma. These lesions are often infected by pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus intermedius. Infection is another risk. Horses that lick wounds may become infected by a stomach parasite, Habronema, a type of nematode worm. The rabies virus may be transmitted between kudu antelopes by wound licking.|$|E

25|$|Lick fit is {{the frantic}} licking to which Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs can be prone. This has been {{reported}} in 17% of the breed. When in the middle of <b>a</b> <b>lick</b> fit, the dog will lick anything they can — carpet, floors, walls — and will eat anything they can find, including grass, leaves, dirt, carpet, and will gulp air and swallow constantly. Their actions make it obvious they are in severe gastrointestinal discomfort. Many owners are able to prevent lick fits by ensuring the dog never has an empty stomach by frequent, smaller meals and large dog biscuits as between meal snacks.|$|E
25|$|The tongue evolved {{with the}} {{amphibians}} {{from the same}} structures that form fins in fishes. Most amphibians show a proper tongue after their metamorphosis. As a consequence most vertebrate animals - amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals - have tongues. In mammals such as dogs and cats, the tongue {{is often used to}} clean the fur and body by licking. The tongues of these species have a very rough texture which allows them to remove oils and parasites. Some dogs have a tendency to consistently lick a part of their foreleg which can result in a skin condition known as <b>a</b> <b>lick</b> granuloma. A dog's tongue also acts as a heat regulator. As a dog increases its exercise the tongue will increase in size due to greater blood flow. The tongue hangs out of the dog's mouth and the moisture on the tongue will work to cool the bloodflow.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{found the}} game to be largely unchallenging. Roper stated that [...] "there really isn't any sort of a {{challenge}} here", particularly due to the player character's inability to die; Leadbetter summed up the game's difficulty as [...] "negligible". However, when reviewing the PlayStation Portable version of the game, Justin Calvart of GameSpot took the view that [...] "the game's difficulty masterfully scales to match your skill level", {{so that it does}} not become overly [...] "frantic or frustrating". Reviewers were universally dismissive of the multiplayer mode, with Calvart saying that [...] "whatever it is, it's not good".

500|$|Musically, {{the album}} sees the band {{moving away from}} nu metal and {{focusing}} on a style categorized as groove metal. With strong elements of groove metal on the album, All Hope is Gone also features elements of death metal and thrash metal. Magazine Yell! wrote that All Hope is Gone [...] "expands on" [...] Slipknot's [...] "thrash metal guitar work and vocal melodies." [...] Prior to the album's release, Slipknot's members displayed interest in making All Hope Is Gone their heaviest album, which Joey Jordison affirmed saying, [...] "It's going to be heavier than , but just as weird and as experimental." [...] Corey Taylor reiterated this, describing All Hope Is Gone as a [...] "very dark" [...] combination of the band's two previous studio albums, Iowa and Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses). In All Hope Is Gone, Slipknot expands on their use of traditional song structures, acoustics, and solos that they introduced on their previous album Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses). The song [...] "Snuff" [...] is led by acoustic guitars and has been dubbed as Slipknot's [...] "attempt at a power ballad", though it remains [...] "dark and ominous". In an interview with Artistdirect, Shawn Crahan stated, [...] "Everyone can feel the pain that's in there. It's not forced upon you. You have it in there innately." [...] Slipknot also retained a metal edge reminiscent of their earlier work. Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic wrote that [...] "Gematria (The Killing Name)" [...] goes from [...] "a cluster of cacophony" [...] to [...] "an onslaught of densely dark intricate riffs". Crahan compared it to the song [...] "(sic)" [...] from their debut album, explaining, [...] "The technique and the style are very reminiscent of the old, brutal shit that we've done." [...] Jim Kaz of IGN stated that the [...] "swaggering, cock-rock groove and an anthemic chorus" [...] of [...] "Psychosocial" [...] gives Slipknot the potential {{to reach out to}} new fans [...] "without sacrificing <b>a</b> <b>lick</b> of intensity". Crahan stated he [...] "loves" [...] his parts of [...] "Psychosocial", in which the band incorporates snare drums, reminiscent of [...] "Before I Forget". He also cited [...] "This Cold Black" [...] as one of his favorite songs, saying that it has a [...] "driving tempo and a lot of attitude". The track [...] "Gehenna" [...] incorporates elements of Slipknot's slower, more cerebral edge reminiscent of [...] "Prosthetics" [...] and [...] "Purity" [...] from their debut album, and [...] "Skin Ticket" [...] from Iowa. Crahan called it a [...] "trippy song", explaining, [...] "It's just somewhere we go." ...|$|E

On the other hand, THEM Anime Reviews' Raphael criticized Terry' story as being seen several times in other series and also panned his final fight with Geese Howard {{due to the lack of}} regular martial arts and instead chi-like energy. Although the live-action film of The King of Fighters has been panned, Beyond Hollywood said that [...] "the only saving grace of “KOF” is David Leitch, who is flat-out hilarious as world-weary CIA agent Terry Bogard.
