The virtual disk channel *DA1 is assigned to the top workfile (holding the assembler output) and yet another workfile is created for the linker.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The axoneme is {{the basic}} {{functional}} unit of the eucaryotic flagellum. Periodic structures appended to its 9 + 2 microtubule core are responsible for generation of flagellar bending. An account of biochemical and genetic studies of flagellar-defective mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtü is presented. These studies provide insights into the complex molecular composition of the <b>appended</b> structures, their <b>mode</b> of assembly, {{and the way in}} which they interact to modulate flagellar function. Microtubular structures appear in a variety offorms in dividing and nondividing eucaryotic cells. In each form the microtubular structure itself and its major component subunits s-and ß-tubulin show close homology, not only among microtubular systems of a single organism but from organism to organism. It is likely that the particular form and function of a specific microtubular array depends mostly on molecules and structures appended to the basic tubulin framework. Nowhere is this more obvious and more thoroughly studie...|$|R
6000|$|How wittily {{would he}} mistake your meaning, {{and put in}} a conceit most seasonably out of season. His talk without {{affectation}} was compressed, like his beloved Elizabethans, even unto obscurity. Like grains of fine gold, his sentences would beat out into whole sheets. He had small mercy on spurious fame, and a caustic observation on the FASHION FOR MEN OF GENIUS was a standing dish. Sir Thomas Browne was a 'bosom cronie' of his; so was Burton, and old Fuller. In his amorous vein he dallied with that peerless Duchess of many-folio odour; and with the heyday comedies of Beaumont and Fletcher he induced light dreams. He would deliver critical touches on these, like one inspired, but it was good to let him choose his own game; if another began even on the acknowledged pets he was liable to interrupt, or rather <b>append,</b> in a <b>mode</b> difficult to define whether as misapprehensive or mischievous. One night at C-'s, the above dramatic partners were the temporary subject of chat. Mr. X. commended the passion and haughty style of a tragedy (I don't know which of them), but was instantly taken up by Elia, who told him 'THAT was nothing; the lyrics were the high things--the lyrics!' ...|$|R
