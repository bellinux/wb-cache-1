25|$|Tetraplegic Matt Nagle {{became the}} first person to control an {{artificial}} hand using a BCI in 2005 as part of the first nine-month human trial of Cyberkinetics’s BrainGate chip-implant. Implanted in Nagle’s right precentral gyrus (area of the motor cortex for arm movement), the 96-electrode BrainGate implant allowed Nagle to control a robotic arm by thinking about moving his hand as well as a computer cursor, lights and TV. One year later, professor Jonathan Wolpaw received the prize of the <b>Altran</b> Foundation for Innovation to develop a Brain Computer Interface with electrodes located {{on the surface of the}} skull, instead of directly in the brain.|$|E

40|$|With {{the advent}} of RNA-sequencing technology, we can detect {{different}} types of alternative splicing and determine how DNA variation regulates splicing. However, given the short read lengths used in most population-based RNA-sequencing experiments, quantifying transcripts accurately remains a challenge. Here we present a method, <b>Altrans,</b> for discovery of alternative splicing quantitative trait loci (asQTLs). To assess the performance of <b>Altrans,</b> we compared it to Cufflinks and MISO in simulations and Cufflinks for asQTL discovery. Simulations show that {{in the presence of}} unannotated transcripts, <b>Altrans</b> performs better in quantifications than Cufflinks and MISO. We have applied <b>Altrans</b> and Cufflinks to the Geuvadis dataset, which comprises samples from European and African populations, and discovered (FDR = 1 %) 1, 427 and 166 asQTLs with <b>Altrans</b> and 1, 737 and 304 asQTLs with Cufflinks for Europeans and Africans, respectively. We show that, by discovering a set of asQTLs in a smaller subset of European samples and replicating these in the remaining larger subset of Europeans, both methods achieve similar replication levels (95 % for both methods). We find many Altrans-specific asQTLs, which replicate to a high degree (93 %). This is mainly due to junctions absent from the annotations and hence not tested with Cufflinks. The asQTLs are significantly enriched for biochemically active regions of the genome, functional marks, and variants in splicing regions, highlighting their biological relevance. We present an approach for discovering asQTLs that is a more direct assessment of splicing compared to other methods and is complementary to other transcript quantification methods...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{our group}} {{performed}} {{a set of}} direct numerical simulations (DNS) of soot formation and growth in a n-heptane three dimensional non-premixed jet flame [Attili et al., Proc. Comb. Inst, 35, 2015], [Attili et al., Comb. Flame, 161, 2014], [Bisetti et <b>al.,Trans</b> of the Royal Soc, 372, 2014]. The evolution of species relevant to soot formation and growth have been sampled along {{a large number of}} Lagrangian trajectories in the DNS. In this work, the DNS results are post-processed to compute the soot evolution along selected Lagrangian trajectories using a Monte Carlo method. An operator splitting approach is adopted to split the deterministic processes (nucleation, surface growth and oxidation) from coagulation, which is treated stochastically. The morphological properties of soot and the particlesize distribution are investigated. For trajectories that experience an early strong nucleation event, the particle size distribution is found to be bimodal, as the soot particles have enough time to coagulate and grow while it is unimodal for trajectories characterized by only late nucleation events. As a results, the average size distribution at two different crosswise positions in the flame is unimodal...|$|R

5000|$|In 1998, the <b>Altran</b> Foundation prize {{was awarded}} to the Toulouse-Rangueil University laboratory, and to the Kappa Biotech company [...] for their pain-treatment project based on cell {{micro-encapsulation}}. The micro-encapsulation process stops the organism from rejecting these cells by protecting them in a sphere, thus preventing the immune system from recognizing them. The process involves creating biocompatible micro-membranes which are implanted using in-vitro fertilization technology. Until recently, the implantation posed a number of productivity problems, as it was taking 15 minutes for one micro-membrane to be implanted. <b>Altran</b> teams stepped in to help solve this problem. Their studies demonstrated that the automated implantation option, using a laser optical guidance system, was the most promising approach. With the cooperation of Tarbes E.N.I. students, <b>Altran</b> consultants developed a robot to automate the microcapsule filling operation using a dual-needle system. The robot is now commercialized.|$|E
