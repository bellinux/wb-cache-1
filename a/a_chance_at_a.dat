Sporting director Fabio Baldato stated that the team's nine-man squad was designed to give them <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> stage win every day, with Kristoff for the sprints, Kohler, Wyss, and Zahner for the breakaways, and Tschopp and Frank for the climbs. Rounding out the squad were young Americans Barton, Beyer, and Butler, riding the Giro mainly for experience. They constituted three of the seven Americans in the Giro peloton. The team's preparation for the Giro was also affected by the Mantova investigation, {{which resulted in the}} team's banning of Ballan and Santambrogio for the second time, after a previous ban in April 2010. Again just as in 2010, the two were reactivated shortly after the Giro concluded.|$|E

Goodrich shared Player of the Year honors with Princeton's Bill Bradley. The 1966 squad was denied <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> triple crown, finishing second to Oregon State in the Athletic Association of Western Universities (now the Pac-12). UCLA was ineligible {{to play in}} the NCAA tournament that year, because in those days only conference champions were guaranteed a bid to the tournament. The Bruins' 1967 incarnation returned with a vengeance with sophomore star Alcindor, reclaiming not only the conference title, but the national crown with another 30–0 season, and then retaining it every season but one until Wooden's retirement immediately following the 1975 NCAA championship.|$|E

From 1972 to 1975, Michigan failed to win a game against Ohio State (powered by phenom running back Archie Griffin), finishing at 101, 1001, 101, and 822. However, Michigan did tie Ohio State in 1973, only missing out on the Rose Bowl due to a controversial vote that sent Ohio State to the Rose Bowl and left Michigan at home. Another notable event occurred during the 1975 season, with the first of Michigan's record streak of games with more than 100,000 people in attendance occurring during {{a game against the}} Purdue Boilermakers.|$|E

New Zealand fought back through top-scorer Ross Taylor, who hit a fast-paced 66 off 72 balls before being trapped LBW to Anderson, and Kane Williamson, who ended the day unbeaten on 44. Dean Brownlie's was the last wicket {{of the day to}} fall, bringing captain Brendon McCullum to the crease with New Zealand on 153/4 at the close of play. However, McCullum lasted just five balls the following morning, caught behind for 2 runs off the bowling of Stuart Broad. It was the wicket of Williamson that spelled New Zealand's downfall, though, the last four wickets falling for 30 runs in fewer than 10 overs. Anderson's wicket of Bruce Martin gave him his fourth Test five-wicket haul at Lord's.|$|E

25|$|Going into 2007, Michigan {{had high}} expectations. Standout players Chad Henne, Mike Hart, and Jake Long all opted {{to return for}} their senior seasons for one last crack at Ohio State and <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> {{national}} championship, causing Michigan to be ranked fifth in the preseason polls. However, Michigan's struggles against the spread offense reared its ugly head again as the Wolverines shockingly lose the opener to the Appalachian State Mountaineers. The game marked the first win by a Division I-AA team over a team ranked in the Associated Press Poll. The next week, Michigan was blown out by Oregon, another spread team. Despite the early rough start, Michigan won their next eight games {{and went into the}} Ohio State game with a chance to win the Big Ten championship. However, Michigan once again fell to the Buckeyes, this time 14–3. After the game, Lloyd Carr announced that he would retire from Michigan after the bowl game. In the 2008 Capital One Bowl, Carr's final game, Michigan defeated the defending national champion Florida Gators, led by Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow, 41–35. Carr's accomplishments at Michigan included a 122–40 record, five Big Ten championships, and one national championship.|$|E
25|$|Now the {{unexpected}} number one {{contender for the}} heavyweight crown held by Jim Braddock, Schmeling looked forward to his chance to regain the title as first Heavyweight ever, scheduled for that September. The fight was postponed, however, when Braddock injured his hand in training. Rumors existed that the fight's organizers were stalling, afraid of the negative publicity that would be generated over a perceived Nazi getting {{a shot at the}} world's title. When it was confirmed that Braddock's managers were in talks with the Louis camp, the New York Commission officially released an order for Braddock to fight Schmeling for the title. Any other fight, with Louis or otherwise, would not be recognized by New York as being for the championship. The Madison Square Garden Corporation, the largest promotional company in the sport at the time, even attempted to get a legal injunction against a Braddock-Louis fight (Louis was not on their roster). Nonetheless, in February 1937, Schmeling received the news that the champion had indeed signed to defend his championship against Louis. A furious Schmeling protested, but to no avail, and he was forced to watch from ringside as Louis knocked Braddock out and gained the championship. Sorely disappointed and convinced that he would never receive his chance at redemption, Schmeling fought just once more in America, an eighth-round knockout of future contender Harry Thomas, before returning to Germany. In his native land, Schmeling was regarded as a hero and promoted by the Nazi propaganda machine as a perfect example of German supremacy over {{the rest of the world}} by virtue of his defeat of the current champion, Louis. The government ordered parades and rallies in his honor. He became a friend to Hitler and other powerful figures in the government and also a popular subject of newspaper articles and films. He continued to press for <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> rematch with Louis and in the meantime padded his record against overmatched fighters Ben Foord and Steve Dudas.|$|E
500|$|The {{first draft}} of the script {{introduced}} the character as John Ericssen—who is revealed {{to be a man}} involved in [...] "The First World Tyranny", named Ragnar Thorwald.

In the original script, Kirk forgives Ericssen and offers him and his people <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> fresh start—something that remained in the final episode—but the character committing murder would have precluded such an ending, as NBC censors would have necessitated the [...] "bad guy" [...] be punished for his actions.|$|E

Ruy considers this a betrayal of his country and his art, whereas Tito recognizes the financial necessity of it. At the same time, Ruy is dealing with the fact that his children and their mother Caridad (Sierra) are leaving for the United States. Art versus commerce, nationalism versus globalism, and communism versus capitalism are some of the themes of the film.|$|R

He caught a line drive over second base, stepped on the bag to get one runner and tagged the other one coming into second from first. He told the {{reporter}} covering the game that exactly the same thing had happened to him the previous year at USC, but he threw to first instead of tagging the runner to complete the triple play. He said a teammate had pointed out that he had missed <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>at</b> <b>an</b> unassisted triple play, and he had promised himself if it ever happened again, he would do it differently.|$|R
