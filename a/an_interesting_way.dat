5|$|To {{demonstrate}} Henry's immortality, Miller {{decided that}} Henry would die and {{would feel the}} pain every time he died. Anything on Henry's body would disappear with his body during each death. Miller felt that Henry's naked rebirth in water would be <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>way</b> to keep the show's protagonist alive during the series by completing the death and rebirth process; the nakedness would create several comedic moments within the series. Miller intended to use Henry's death and rebirth process sporadically after the first two episodes so that the series would focus on Henry's long life.|$|E
25|$|Because it {{encompasses}} many species-rich ecosystems for animals, fungi and plants, Brazil houses {{many thousands}} of species, with many (if not most) of them still undiscovered. Due to the relatively explosive economic and demographic rise {{of the country in}} the last century, Brazil's ability to protect its environmental habitats has increasingly come under threat. Extensive logging in the nation's forests, particularly the Amazon, both official and unofficial, destroys areas {{the size of a small}} country each year, and potentially a diverse variety of plants and animals. However, as various species possess special characteristics, or are built in <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>way,</b> some of their capabilities are being copied for use in technology (see bionics), and the profit potential may result in a retardation of deforestation.|$|E
25|$|Measurements of the {{preceding}} sort are of ambient air - that is, air where people might breathe it and not in workplaces. These measurements are usually reliable and available. A possibly trickier measurement is of where the pollution comes from, often a question addressed by emissions inventories. In BC and other Canadian jurisdictions facilities are required to report to Environment Canada {{on an annual basis}} their releases of toxic substances to the air. There is a natural tendency in self reporting to under-report, notwithstanding which the inventory resulting tracks releases in <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>way.</b> At the NPRI we can see a complex example in the historical report summary of Canfor's NPRI reporting in recent years. Criticisms of such reporting has been done by Scott Vaughan, Commissioner for Sustainable Development and the Environment in his Fall 2009 report.|$|E

500|$|Rippy {{used the}} Audiokinetic Wwise {{pipeline}} to create dynamic music that changes with {{the action in}} the game. Although Rippy used Wwise's tools only for dynamic music, they made audio system setup much easier than in previous Ensemble games. For each battle sequence, the musical cue was divided into sections and mixed differently for each section. [...] "When a cue is triggered, an intro plays and then the game randomly picks between all of those elements {{for as long as}} the battle continues," [...] Rippy explained. [...] "Once it's over, an outro plays and then it's back to the regular [...] "world" [...] music. It was <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>way</b> to work, and I'd like to push it further if there's an opportunity in the future." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{news that}} Streep {{would meet with}} Frankel was celebrated at Fox. But while Streep, for her part, knew the movie could be very successful, she felt the pay she was being offered for playing Miranda was [...] "slightly, if not insulting, not perhaps {{reflective}} of my actual value to the project." [...] The producers doubled it to around $4 million, and she signed on, allowing Fox to greenlight the film. According to Frankel, Streep saw the film {{as a chance to}} [...] "skewer the doyennes of the fashion world." [...] She has three daughters, and as an ardent feminist, felt that fashion magazines [...] "twisted the minds of young women around the world and their priorities. This was <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>way</b> to get back at them." [...] Also, she said, the film passed the Bechdel test.|$|E
500|$|On {{the subject}} of {{returning}} for the sequel, Larter was chosen by New Line Cinema over her co-star Devon Sawa, who played as Alex Browning in the first film. [...] "We’ve brought back Clear in <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>way</b> and we just felt that to bring both of them back would make you wonder too much just what the hell they’d {{been doing for the}} past few months," [...] producer Craig Perry conveyed on developing the cliffhanger of Final Destination. Perry said that bringing back Clear over Alex was due to narrative reasons, stating that there were no financial problems that prevented Sawa from returning. He also observed that Clear is more knowledgeable in terms of mentoring the new protagonist and that she was utilized as the main link to the original film. Larter was delighted when New Line reinstated her and found it [...] "terrific" [...] that she had some input into the script. As a result, Sawa's character was killed off-screen in Final Destination 2, as divulged by Clear to Kimberly during their first meeting.|$|E

500|$|Outside of {{the battle}} system, GameSpot commented that the world map's [...] "sparsely {{detailed}} overhead view gives {{the impression of a}} board game, and you need to employ a puzzle-game mind-set to effectively use your limited pieces to clear the appropriate number of tiles. It's <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>way</b> to open up new places to explore, and it even ties in to the combat". Critics also praised the weapon customization system, [...] "the weapon upgrade system puts a unique spin on traditional standards. Although you do earn the occasional new gun, you spend more time enhancing your current firearm." [...] RPGamer gave the game its Most Original award, for presenting [...] "a gaming experience unlike any this past year", including a [...] "unique battle system" [...] emphasizing tactical combat, the strategic way in which [...] "the world map was opened up", the ability to [...] "modify almost every aspect of the characters' appearances", and [...] "the way that its story is told."

500|$|In 2002, Rick and Laura Brown, two sculptors from Massachusetts, {{along with}} Massachusetts College of Art and Design {{students}} and faculty, constructed another replica. The Browns {{set out to}} gain a better understanding of human ingenuity while keeping Bushnell’s design, materials, and technique authentic. “With it, Yankee ingenuity was born,” observed Rick Brown, referring to the latest in a long line of commemoration that perceived the Turtle as something authentically American. Of the temptation to use synthetic and ahistorical materials, Rob Duarte, a MassArts student observed, “It was always a temptation to use silicone to seal the thing," [...] says Rob Duarte, a MassArt student. [...] "Then you realized that someone else had to figure this out with the same limited resources that we were using. That's just <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>way</b> to learn. You can't do it any other way than by actually doing it.” The outer shell of the replica was hallowed, using controlled fire, from a twelve-foot Sitka Spruce. The log was seven feet in diameter and shipped from British Columbia. This replica took twelve days to build and was successfully submerged in water. In 2003, it was tested in an indoor test tank at the United States Naval Academy. Lew Nuckols, a professor of Ocean Engineering at USNA, made ten dives, noting “you feel very isolated from the outside world. If you had any sense of claustrophobia it would not be a very good experience.” ...|$|E

[...] Shawna Malcom for the Los Angeles Times deemed Terri [...] "beyond annoying" [...] in the {{following}} episode, [...] "Acafellas", but wrote: [...] "I have confidence that creator Ryan Murphy will flesh out Jessalyn Gilsig’s character over time. Her seemingly sincere apology to Will for not being more supportive of his boy band was a nice first step." [...] Eric Goldman for IGN commented after the episode [...] "Preggers": [...] "So far, Terri has been an incredibly unlikable character. More firmly establishing her as this devilish type of schemer at least pushes her far {{enough to make her}} actions entertaining, even as we root against her." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly noted of the episode [...] "Throwdown": [...] "the pregnancy subplot is dragging down the show, and tonight that subplot nearly derailed an otherwise-excellent episode. Terri's fake pregnancy and Quinn’s real one started out a few weeks ago as <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>way</b> to insert some realism and tension into a delightfully surreal musical-comedy universe. By now, however, I watch Glee and feel sorry for Jessalyn Gilsig. I’ll bet the actress didn’t initially sign on to have her character Terri become a shrill, lying nag whose main function is to bring husband Will — and by extension, us — down." ...|$|E

500|$|Carla Gugino {{revealed}} in August 2009 {{that she had}} begun taking singing lessons for her part in the film. One month later, Jamie Chung announced {{in an interview with}} E! Entertainment that recording for the soundtrack had begun. When Emily Browning auditioned for her role as Babydoll, Snyder asked her to sing because of the musical element in the film. He told her to record herself while singing, and the actress did a version of [...] "Killing Me Softly with His Song". Browning later said, [...] "I was terrified, of course. But he liked it. I have no idea why, but he thought me capable of carrying a tune on the screen." [...] The crew liked the result and offered her to sing more songs. At first it was just a cover of [...] "Where Is My Mind?" [...] by Pixies, which ended up becoming a duet with Yoav, but the producers extended to three songs. One, a version by [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] by Eurythmics, is used to open the movie, and Bates noted that [...] " [...] first line of dialogue is actually 27 minutes into the film so it is <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>way</b> to introduce her character." [...] The other came up when during a discussion on her favorite music with Snyder, Browning said that The Smiths was her favorite band. Several weeks later, Snyder informed her that he had acquired the rights to The Smiths' song [...] "Asleep", and asked her if she would like to perform the lead vocals. At first, she hesitated, saying that [...] "The offer was flattering, but there was so much pressure". However, she recorded the song and according to Snyder, The Smiths' frontman Morrissey was happy with the result. Regarding Browning's performance, de Vries considered that [...] "having Emily sing—essentially commenting in song on her character’s situation in the film — provided an interesting texture, real resonance and depth, and tied the music to the visuals in a way that might otherwise not have been so clearly defined", and Snyder found the actress' [...] "emotional delivery" [...] to [...] "make the songs even more poignant". To work with Browning between takes, de Vries used a portable recording rig on a room with a piano - [...] "a very distressed, out-of-tune, almost-unusable instrument (...) which turned out to have real charm in it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{script for}} the 1979 film Alien was {{initially}} drafted by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett.

2500|$|During the New York printers' {{strike of}} 1963, when The New York Times {{and six other}} {{newspapers}} suspended publication, Hardwick, her husband Robert Lowell, and Jason and Barbara Epstein, saw an opportunity to introduce the sort of vigorous book review that Hardwick had imagined. Jason Epstein knew that book publishers would advertise their books in the new publication, since they had no other outlet for promoting new books. The group asked Silvers, who was still at Harper's, to edit the issue, and Silvers asked Barbara Epstein to co-edit it with him. Silvers and Epstein [...] "became an inseparable double act", editing The New York Review of Books together for the next 43 years, until her death in 2006. Silvers continued as sole editor {{until his death in}} March 2017. In later years, he described his motivation for continuing to edit the Review: [...] "I feel it's a fantastic opportunity – because of the freedom of it, because of the sense that there are marvelous, intensely interesting, important questions that {{you have a chance to}} try to deal with in <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>way.</b> That's an extraordinary opportunity in life. And you'd be crazy not to try and make the most of it." [...] He said on another occasion: [...] "We do what we want and don't try to figure out what the public wants." [...] Asked in 2007 about who might succeed him as editor, Silvers replied: [...] "It's not a question that's posing itself". In 2012, he added, [...] "I can think of several people who would be marvelous editors." ...|$|E
