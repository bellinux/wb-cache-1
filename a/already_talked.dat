500|$|Shortly after The Living Daylights was released, {{producer}} Albert R. Broccoli {{and writers}} Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum started discussing its successor. The film would retain a realistic style, {{as well as}} showing the [...] "darker edge" [...] of the Bond character. For the primary location, the producers wanted {{a place where the}} series had not yet visited. While China was visited after an invitation by its government, the idea fell through partly because the 1987 film The Last Emperor had removed some of the novelty from filming in China. By this stage the writers had <b>already</b> <b>talked</b> about a chase sequence along the Great Wall, as well as a fight scene amongst the Terracotta Army. Wilson also wrote two plot outlines about a drug lord in the Golden Triangle before the plans fell through. The writers eventually decided on a setting in a tropical country while Broccoli negotiated to film in Mexico, at the Estudios Churubusco in Mexico City. In 1985, the Films Act was passed, removing the Eady Levy, resulting in foreign artists being taxed more heavily. The associated rising costs to Eon Productions meant no part of Licence to Kill was filmed in the UK, the first Bond film not to do so. Pinewood Studios, used in every previous Bond film, housed only the post-production and sound re-recording.|$|E

2500|$|Destination {{memory is}} the ability to {{remember}} information one has conveyed to others. Telling a story multiple times, unaware that listeners have heard the story before, is an example of destination memory failure. Destination memory is important for conversations because it allows people to recall what was <b>already</b> <b>talked</b> about. Deficiency in destination memory is more common among older adults, but has been reported by university students as well. Destination memory is notoriously poor due to ineffective integration of components of episodic memory. [...] However, there appear to be few, if any, negative social implications for poor destination memory.|$|E
50|$|There was <b>already</b> <b>talk</b> in 1964 of {{establishing}} a technical college in Umeå. Nothing definite came out of these discussions until 1 July 1997 when the Umeå Institute of Technology was established.|$|R

2500|$|In a 2016 feature via The Quietus, Kavus Torabi {{shed light}} on several past, present, and future Cardiacs projects. [...] It was an {{extraordinarily}} interesting and brilliant time for me because we’d <b>already</b> <b>talked</b> {{a great deal about}} what the plan was {{for the next few years}} for Cardiacs. We were going to make a film. Tim and I were planning out loads of treatments and scripts. Tim wanted to share the burden of Cardiacs a bit with someone and I was more than happy to do that. The way things stand, [...] is nearly done but needs vocals and eyebrows and some of them need a few other touches. What there is does sound great but there’s far more stuff completed that hasn’t come out yet, that needs to come out. Tim is a perfectionist, and rightly so. Because his melodies make so much sense of everything, it would be ridiculous to put out these recordings, as exciting as they are, without the melodies. We have talked about people who Tim would approve of adding vocals, under his direction. I think Tim just wants to be well enough to really be producing it. I think his big drive at the moment is to finish off things that were started. There are a lot of loose ends that need tying up.|$|E

50|$|A {{successful}} barrister, Melville Farr (Dirk Bogarde) has {{a thriving}} London practice. He is on course {{to become a}} Queen's Counsel and people are <b>already</b> <b>talking</b> of his being appointed a judge. He is apparently happily married to his wife, Laura (Sylvia Syms).|$|R
5000|$|As {{a natural}} centre half back player, Hansen's {{physical}} stature places {{him in the}} immediate limelight with media pundits <b>already</b> <b>talking</b> of an upcoming rivalry {{between himself and the}} number 2 draft pick from Essendon, Scott Gumbleton who is natural centre half forward.http://afl.com.au/default.asp?pg=news&spg=display&articleid=307723 ...|$|R
5000|$|There are <b>already</b> <b>talks</b> of {{reservations}} in {{the private}} sector. If even after providing so many facilities to reserved categories during education, {{if there is no}} adequate representation of those people in the work force, there must be some problems with the education system.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{there is}} a scoundrel on this earth,' said Mr. Micawber, {{suddenly}} breaking out again with the utmost vehemence, 'with whom I have <b>already</b> <b>talked</b> too much, that scoundrel's name is--HEEP!' ...|$|E
60|$|Of {{course the}} boys had <b>already</b> <b>talked</b> over the {{telephone}} to the girls, and then it leaked out that all of those at Clearwater Hall knew about Big Horn Ranch and that Ruth was almost certain that she could go with the Rover girls and May.|$|E
60|$|The boys then dispersed, and Leigh {{returned}} to the priest's. He and Martin had <b>already</b> <b>talked</b> over their disguises, and had agreed that those of fishermen {{would be the most}} appropriate; but until they could obtain the necessary clothes, they would go in the attire of fairly well-to-do people in a country town.|$|E

60|$|By {{this time}} they had entered the room again, and Ralph saw that Percy was <b>already</b> <b>talking</b> to the landlord--with whom, indeed, {{he was on the}} point of leaving the room. He turned round, upon hearing the party come in again, and gave a slight start of pleasure.|$|R
6000|$|... "You could expose them, {{but they}} would then deny the whole story, {{and you have no}} evidence. They would demand to know your informant, and I should be disgraced, and the Princess, who is <b>already</b> <b>talked</b> about, made a subject of scandal. But no matter! It is right that an American's {{independence}} shall not be interfered with." ...|$|E
60|$|Those on the {{houseboat}} had <b>already</b> <b>talked</b> {{the matter}} over {{and decided to}} move on {{at least as far}} as Baraville, about twenty miles from New Orleans.

6000|$|The young girl's eye brightened {{with a quick}} vivacity at the name, but {{a moment}} after became {{reflective}} and slightly embarrassed. [...] "I know him--I met him at Mr. Leyton's.

Yours, now, I fancy would be quite independent." ...|$|E
50|$|Although BK Special only {{formed in}} the summer of 2006, {{by the end of that}} year, they were <b>already</b> <b>talking</b> about {{recording}} their first CD.

40|$|The Asian Pacific {{countries}} do not only show unparalled growth dynamics, {{they are also}} in the process of growing ever closer together.

30|$|In 1859, Florence Nightingale was <b>already</b> <b>talking</b> {{about the}} {{positive}} effect of light, colour and hospital environment on the body—and therefore on the illness—and {{not just on}} the minds of patients. However, although extensive scientific literature has demonstrated a very tight link between the environment and the increase in the effectiveness of treatment, still little attention is paid to the design quality of hospital facilities (Rosen 1993).|$|R
60|$|She {{drove home}} {{through the village}} slowly, hoping for a chance of a further {{interchange}} of conjectures and impressions; but she saw no one she had not <b>already</b> <b>talked</b> with till she met Dr. Morrell, driving out of the avenue from his house.

6000|$|... "I don't {{know any}} good word to say," [...] she answered, [...] "except {{that you take}} {{excellent}} care of babies, and I am {{not at all sure}} that that would have any weight with Stephen Petter.

6000|$|... "I {{heard the}} whole story, my boy, and have <b>already</b> <b>talked</b> with Mr. Hargreaves, whom I met {{a few moments}} ago.

5000|$|Google, Twitter, Facebook — are U.S. {{companies}} that other governments increasingly fear as political agents. Chinese, Cuban, Iranian, and even Turkish politicians are <b>already</b> <b>talking</b> up [...] "information sovereignty" [...] {{a euphemism for}} replacing services provided by Western Internet companies with their own more limited but somewhat easier to control products, further splintering the World Wide Web into numerous national Internets.

50|$|In 1972, Bouwer was <b>already</b> <b>talking</b> of a 112-vertices edge- but not vertex-transitive cubic graph {{found by}} R. M. Foster, {{nonetheless}} unpublished. Conder, Malnič, Marušič, Pisanski and Potočnik rediscovered this 112-vertices graph in 2002 and named it the Ljubljana graph after {{the capital of}} Slovenia. They proved {{that it was the}} unique 112-vertices edge- but not vertex-transitive cubic graph and therefore that was the graph found by Foster.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Ferguson {{had also}} {{well-defined}} opinions upon the subject. She had two daughters {{who were more}} than half grown, had learned all {{that they could be}} taught in Plainton, and she was very anxious to send them away to school, where their natural talents could be properly cultivated. She felt that she owed a deep and solemn duty to these girls, and she had <b>already</b> <b>talked</b> to Mrs. Cliff about them.|$|E
60|$|She did so and Bell's mean face got thoughtful. On the whole, Janet did not exaggerate much, {{although}} she {{now and then}} made a rather unwarranted implication. She threw a fresh light on matters the gossips <b>already</b> <b>talked</b> about; among others were Grace's visit to Mireside the morning Railton's sheep were counted and her meeting with Kit {{before he went to}} look for the Herdwicks. When she stopped Bell knitted his brows.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{report more}} than bears out what I heard from Captain Twentyman. I have <b>already</b> <b>talked</b> the matter over with Colonel Somerset, {{and as we}} {{consider}} that such an action should be signally rewarded, Colonel Somerset will at once apply for a commission for you in your own corps, or if you would prefer it, I will apply for a commission for you {{in one of the}} line regiments. I may say that the application under such circumstances would certainly be acceded to." ...|$|E
