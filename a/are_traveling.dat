5|$|In the episode's opening scene, the Griffins <b>are</b> <b>traveling</b> to Quagmire's {{cabin in}} the woods; Peter notes {{that it will be}} a better {{vacation}} than when they appeared in the American game show The Price Is Right pricing game Cliff Hangers. Cleveland is also shown playing the pricing game Plinko.

5|$|Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino and {{her parents}} <b>are</b> <b>traveling</b> to their new home when her father takes a wrong turn.

However, Chihiro discovers too late that her parents have turned into pigs and she is unable to cross the flooded river, becoming trapped in the spirit world.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene with}} Peter in the hypnotherapist's office was censored from television, as Peter {{discusses}} his genitals and reproductive organs. When Peter {{comes to the}} realization that Francis is not his real father and when Stewie dreams about being tortured by Lois, a harp sound can be heard; MacFarlane comments that even small things like that take {{a lot of work to}} produce. The alcohol bottles being pushed by the airplane that Peter and Brian <b>are</b> <b>traveling</b> on were animated by computer, as is the taxi driving along the street. On the DVD commentary, MacFarlane notes that the scene would not have looked good without computer aid. He said it makes the animations seem more realistic than without a computer. The two men circling each other for fifty years and waiting for the other to throw the first punch was not broadcast for television.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{distinction}} between a redshift in cosmological context as compared to that witnessed when nearby objects exhibit a local Doppler-effect redshift. Rather than cosmological redshifts being {{a consequence of the}} relative velocities that are subject to the laws of special relativity (and thus subject to the rule that no two locally separated objects can have relative velocities with respect to each other faster than the speed of light), the photons instead increase in wavelength and redshift because of a global feature of the spacetime metric through which they <b>are</b> <b>traveling.</b> One interpretation of this effect is the idea that space itself is expanding. Due to the expansion increasing as distances increase, the distance between two remote galaxies can increase at more than 3 m/s, but this does not imply that the galaxies move faster than the speed of light at their present location (which is forbidden by Lorentz covariance).|$|E

Indeed, many observant Jews who design their home's porch or deck will do so in a fashion that aligns with their sukkah-building needs.

25|$|Once the non-Schengen {{expansion}} is finished, the airport {{will have an}} opportunity to accommodate the largest wide-body aircraft; the Airbus A380. This would fix the issue today where Norwegians <b>are</b> <b>traveling</b> to other international airports for connecting flights {{to the rest of the}} world, because OSL is too small for handling a long-haul international network. Another phase will be added later on to bring the total capacity to 35 million passengers annually through the T2-project.|$|E
25|$|Vacuum Cherenkov {{radiation}} at superluminal {{speed of}} any particle (protons, electrons, neutrinos) having a charge structure. In this case, emission of Bremsstrahlung can occur, until the particle falls below threshold and subluminal speed is reached again. This {{is similar to}} the known Cherenkov radiation in media, in which particles <b>are</b> <b>traveling</b> faster than the phase velocity of light in that medium. Deviations from the limiting velocity can be constrained by observing high energy particles of distant astronomic sources that reach Earth.|$|E
25|$|In {{more recent}} years, {{scholars}} have noted {{a shift in}} the demographics of migrant workers. Particularly in Asian countries, but also in Latin American countries, a growing number of women <b>are</b> <b>traveling</b> abroad for jobs as domestic and service workers. In many of these cases, women take on jobs caring for the children of families in wealthier nations, while leaving their own children in the country of origin. This can mean that their own children are not well-cared for and may suffer as a result.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the rockets}} are {{constructed}} {{exactly the same}} way, and starting {{at the same moment}} in S with the same acceleration, they must have the same velocity all of the time in S. Thus they <b>are</b> <b>traveling</b> the same distances in S, so their mutual distance cannot change in this frame. Otherwise, if the distance were to contract in S, then this would imply different velocities of the rockets in this frame as well, which contradicts the initial assumption of equal construction and acceleration.|$|E
25|$|In Centreville and Eastern Loudoun County, SR 620 {{is a major}} {{commuter}} route, as it empties onto SR 28 (Sully Rd.), {{which in}} turn has a nearby interchange with Interstate 66. SR 620 also has major junctions with SR 123, the Fairfax County Parkway, and Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway). It has {{a very large number of}} residential neighborhoods lining the road, so most of the remainder is also a major commuter artery. The length and positioning of the highway attract motorists that <b>are</b> <b>traveling</b> from one part of Fairfax County to another.|$|E
25|$|Scintillation {{occurs as}} a result of {{variations}} in the refractive index of the medium through which waves <b>are</b> <b>traveling.</b> The solar wind is a plasma, composed primarily of electrons and lone protons, and the variations in the index of refraction are caused by variations in the density of the plasma. Different indices of refraction result in phase changes between waves traveling through different locations, which results in interference. As the waves interfere, both the frequency of the wave and its angular size are broadened, and the intensity varies.|$|E
