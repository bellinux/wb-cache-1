5|$|<b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the poem, Eliot used terza rima rhyme in {{a manner}} similar to Dante. In a 1950 lecture, he {{discussed}} how he imitated Dante within Little Gidding and the challenges that this presented. The lecture also dwelt on keeping to a set form and how Dante's poetry is the model for religious poetry and poetry in general. Besides Dante, many of the images used in Little Gidding were allusions to Eliot's earlier poems, especially the other poems of the Four Quartets.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{collisions}} between {{electrons and}} atoms, the drift velocity of electrons in a conductor {{is on the}} order of millimeters per second. However, the speed at which a change of current <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the material causes changes in currents {{in other parts of the}} material, the velocity of propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed. This occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity dependent on the dielectric constant of the material.|$|E

5|$|In the 1993–94 season, the Bulls, without Jordan, {{achieved}} a 55–27 record, {{and lost to}} the New York Knicks {{in the second round}} of the playoffs. But the 1994–95 Bulls were a shell of the championship team of just two years earlier. Struggling at mid-season to ensure a spot in the playoffs, Chicago was 31–31 <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> mid-March. The team received help, however, when Jordan decided to return to the NBA for the Bulls.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not exactly}} known how many Jews were helped by Żegota, but <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> 1943 it had 2,500 Jewish {{children}} under its care in Warsaw alone. At {{the end of the}} war, Sendler attempted to locate their parents but nearly all of them had died at Treblinka. It is estimated that about half of the Jews who survived the war (thus over 50,000) were aided in some shape or form by Żegota.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{have noted}} that Brooks uses World War Z as a {{platform}} to criticize government ineptitude, corporate corruption, and human short-sightedness. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the book, a Palestinian refugee living in Kuwait refuses to believe the dead are rising, fearing it is a trick by Israel. Many U.S. characters blame the United States' inability to counter the zombie threat on low confidence in their government due to conflicts in the Middle East.|$|E

The relationship between Shepard and Liara can vary depending on whether they were romantically involved in the original Mass Effect. The mission includes two bosses and a chase scene in which the player must control a high-speed vehicle through the skies of a city. The player may also find numerous in-game upgrades that enhance aspects of the game's weapons and armor.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Clifton High School was {{relocated}} to the property, and in 1941 the U.S. Army Medical Corps established a facility for wounded soldiers, {{known as the}} 74th General Hospital, in the estate grounds. The construction of this temporary tented village resulted in the US Army Engineers breaching what was then England's longest holly hedge. With many tents later replaced by prefabricated buildings and some nissen huts, <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the war following D-Day it became the largest US Army hospital in Europe. During the hostilities, management of the estate's farmland was assumed by the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), leaving Lady Wraxall only the Home Farm.|$|E
5|$|Evgeni Malkin {{was added}} to the All-Star Game on January 22 as a {{replacement}} following an injury to Sidney Crosby. In the game, Malkin recorded two assists. On April 29, the NHL announced that Malkin, along with Alexander Ovechkin and Jarome Iginla, was named as a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy, awarded to the player most valuable to his team. With 106 points, Malkin was the Penguins' leader in scoring. He finished second in the League only to Ovechkin. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the season, Malkin recorded a 15-game point streak, the longest by a Russian player in the NHL. In June, he was announced as the League's top center and honored on the First All-Star Team alongside Ovechkin and Iginla, defensemen Nicklas Lidstrom and Dion Phaneuf, and goaltender Evgeni Nabokov.|$|E

5|$|However, with Moltke crippled, Admiral Scheer {{decided to}} return to base. Though {{scouting}} units of the Grand Fleet made brief contact with the Germans on the morning of 25 April, no action followed, and the High Seas Fleet made it home without incident. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the chase, however, a reversal of course by the Germans meant that the entire Grand Fleet was forced to reorient itself in the opposite direction, placing Battleship Division Nine in the van. The result was that, if an encounter between the two fleets had occurred, American battleships would have led the British fleet into what could have been the largest naval battle of the war.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Atlantic {{tropical}} cyclones were named via the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet. Hurricane Fox of 1952 {{was the final}} Atlantic tropical cyclone to be designated with this naming system, and a female list of tropical cyclone names was utilized in the 1953 Atlantic hurricane season. After the stronger 1917 Pinar del Río hurricane, Hurricane Fox was Cuba's second most intense landfall until Hurricane Michelle struck the island in 2001. Originally, the 1917 hurricane was {{believed to have been}} a Category3 hurricane prior to the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis, which made Fox the second Category4 landfall after the 1932 Cuba Hurricane. At the time, Fox was the fourth most intense hurricane to strike Cuba in terms of atmospheric pressure; only the 1917, 1924, and 1932 storms were stronger <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> their life spans.|$|E
5|$|Kirkland cites his {{assistant}} director Matthew Nastuk {{as a big}} influence on the episode. He became heavily involved with the animation because {{he had grown up}} in New Jersey, where the Thomas Edison National Historical Park that Homer and Bart visit is located. To help make the museum look as authentic as possible, Kirkland and Nastuk visited it and took a large number of photographs that they brought back to the animation studio. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the episode, Homer writes complex math formulas on a chalkboard. The producers wanted them to be actual formulas, so writer David X. Cohen got in contact with a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who were able to provide them.|$|E

40|$|Given polynomials f_ 1,, f_k, g_ 1,, g_s in, we {{consider}} the semi-algebraic set defined by: {{and focus on the}} problem of computing <b>at</b> least <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> each connected component of. We first study how to solve this problem by considering as the union of solutions sets of polynomial systems of equations and strict inequalities and proceed to the complexity analysis of the underlying algorithm. Then, we improve this approach by proving that computing <b>at</b> least <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> each connected component of can be done by computing <b>at</b> least <b>one</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> each connected component of real algebraic sets defined by vanishing the polynomials f_ 1,, f_k and some of the polynomials g_ 1,, g_s. The complexity analysis shows that this latter approach is better than the former one. Finally, we present our implementation and use it to solve an application in Pattern Matching...|$|R
