40|$|To {{examine the}} {{suitability}} for use of different absorbers for desulphurisation, a technical-scale experimental plant was erected for operating conditions of 20 bar and a maximum of 730 C. The site for this plant is the Technical-Scale Test Hall of the RWE Company for Research and Development (RFE) {{on the site of}} DEA Mineraloel AG, UK Wesseling Works. RFE was entrusted with erecting the technical-scale plant and carrying out the experiments. The crude gases of an HTW gasifier with air or oxygen/steam operation are simulated by mixing desulphurized synthetic gas from oil pressure gasification with nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Setting different hydrogen sulphide, ammonia and water contents is done by dosing and joint evaporation of suitably concentrated <b>ammonium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> solutions. There is a heated mixing chamber and a superheater identical to the evaporator after the evaporator, where the gases can be heated to a maximum of 650 C. These flow into the reactor (inside diameter 60 mm, clear height 1360 mm) from the top, via a heated transfer pipe. To measure the temperature profile, there is a pipe with a total of 12 thermocouples in the reactor longitudinal axis. Below the absorbent heap, a heated analysis pipe opens into the reactor, through which a part flow of the gas flows to the analysers after pressure relieving. The main flow of the hot gas is cooled to 180 C in a sulphur cooler after the reactor and then reaches the water cooler via the sulphur separator and the pressure control valve. The separated condensate is locked out via the water separator, while the gases either flow directly to the torch or reach a gas washer. To regenerate the absorber, a gas containing oxygen (air/nitrogen or air/steam mixture) or steam is passed through the reactor along the same route.

Die Rohgase eines HTW-Vergasers bei Luft- bzw. Sauerstoff/Dampf-Fahrweise werden durch Mischen von entschwefeltem Synthesegas aus einer Oeldruckvergasung mit Stickstoff und Kohlendioxid simuliert. Die Einstellung unterschiedlicher Schwefelwasserstoff-, Ammoniak- und Wassergehalte erfolgt durch Zudosieren und gemeinsames Verdampfen entsprechend konzentrierter Ammoniumhydrogensulfid-Loesungen. Hinter dem Verdampfer befindet sich eine beheizte Mischkammer sowie ein zum Verdampfer baugleicher Ueberhitzer, in dem die Gase auf maximal 650 C aufgeheizt werden koennen. Ueber eine beheizte Transferleitung stroemen diese von oben in den Reaktor (Innendurchmesser 60 mm, lichte Hoehe 1360 mm). Zur Erfassung des Temperaturprofils befindet sich in der Reaktorlaengsachse ein Huellrohr mit insgesamt 12 Thermoelementen. Unterhalb der Sorbensschuettung muendet eine beheizte Analysenleitung in den Reaktor, ueber die nach Entspannung ein Teilstrom des Gases zu den Analysatoren stroemt. Der Hauptstrom des heissen Gases wird nach dem Reaktor im Schwefelkuehler auf 180 C abgekuehlt und gelangt ueber den Schwefelabscheider und das Druckregelventil zum Wasserkuehler.

30|$|When carbon {{monoxide}} was pre-adsorbed over the Rh/silica at 293  K and then <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> adsorbed {{over the same}} catalyst, the amount of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> adsorbed was reduced by 85 %.

The extent of hydrogen evolution indicates that the mode of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> adsorption had changed, such that 80 % of the adsorbed sulphur was in the form HS(ads). When <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> was pre-adsorbed and then carbon monoxide adsorbed over the same catalyst, the behaviour observed was similar to the CO/H 2 S couple, but with the carbon monoxide adsorption reduced by 88 %. The two sequential adsorption experiments suggest that there are three sites on the surface, one that adsorbs both carbon monoxide and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide,</b> one that adsorbs only <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> and one which only adsorbs carbon monoxide. These results are in accordance with the literature [7], where multiple sites were also proposed. However, when we consider the co-adsorption experiment, we find a much lower total adsorption (Table  2). The nature of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> adsorption appears similar in that the amount of hydrogen liberated during the adsorption is the same as for the single-gas adsorption. Nevertheless, the adsorption capacity has reduced. It is not clear why such a reduction takes place although both adsorbates may cause restructuring of the metal crystallites.|$|R

However, the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> modelling in a sewer network is crucially dependent on the hydraulic modelling of the sewer.

This paper outlines a novel approach {{for the development of}} hydraulic and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> modelling to predict the concentration of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> in sewer network. The approach combines the calculation of wastewater generation and implementation of flow routing on the EPA SWMM 5. 0 platform to allow hydrodynamic simulations.

A visual change of the colloidal silver film was observed for <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> at 1 ppm within 10 min and at 0. 1 ppm in 60 min...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of <b>hydrogen</b> from <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> has a twofold goal {{as it can}} be seen as a challenging opportunity for combining hydrogen recovery with the abatement of a highly toxic pollutant. Despite the thermodynamics encourage <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> splitting with respect to water splitting, no <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> dissociation process proving a net superiority with respect to others has been exploited at large scale yet. This paper aims at surveying the most important techniques being proposed for <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> splitting, with a particular attention to chemical methods that seem to be promising candidates for real industrial applications. Several processes based on thermal dissociation, catalytic cracking, multistep thermochemical methods and photocatalytic splitting are compared and critically analysed pointing out merits and drawbacks having a basic role in technology transfer. The main objective of this short review consists of collecting new process trends and improvements in pre-existing strategies in matter of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> dissociation during the last two decades. Some new techniques here reported are inspired to recent issues in material science and nanotechnology bringing basic innovations for a non-conventional hydrogen production from such a waste...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> {{formation}} in sewage {{is supposed to}} be due to two distinct processes, the splitting of protein by certain organ-isms and the reduction of inorganic sulphates by others. Led-erer (1913) concludes that more <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> is formed under 'anaerobic than under aerobic conditions. He thinks that the formation of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> from protein is a selective process and that it depends a great deal on the position of the sulphur radical in the protein molecule. At any rate other fac-tors than reduction are involved in <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> formation. An organism may be a very strong nitrate reducer {{and at the same time}} a weak <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> former, although both reac-tions are reducing processes. Lederer is of the opinion that the reduction of inorganic sulphates may however be an important factor in <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> formation, and thinks it probable that the action may be due to some unknown specific organism similar to the Spirillum desulphuricans of Beijerinck (1895). Several workers have observed the formation of hydrogen sul-phide in large quantities in the effluent of sewage disposal plants. Barr and Buchanan (1912) report the isolation of a specific or-ganism in one such instance. Clark (1913) and others have re-ported the reduction of inorganic sulphates in sewages. Sulphur metabolism may also play a beneficial r 6 le in sewage disposal in that certain species of bacteria may cause the oxida-tion of sulphur and of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> to sulphates thus reduc-ing the amount of odor. This is a well known property of such organisms as Beggiatoa and Thiothrix (Jordan, 1918) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of sulphur compounds in natural gas can interfere {{to the quality}} of natural gas. The decline of combustion gas capacity, metal instrument corrosion in gas piping, and the environmental pollution from gas emission can affect by their presence. Bio-filter is one of the methods that selected to reduce sulphur content in natural gas. A lab scale study of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> reduction in natural gas had conducted in oil and gas field using bio-filter method. The bio-filter system (± 1 L volume) contains an active carbon and thiosulphide medium as a substrate, Thiobacillus thioparus as a single culture of sulphur bacteria, and Thiobacillus thioparus with sludge as a mixed culture of sulphur bacteria. The study of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> reduction was conducted with continuous flow line process. The gas flow rate approximately 1. 5 L/min with a fluctuate {{presence of}} <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> (approximately 40 - 70 mg/L). The bio-filter system contains active carbon, thiosulphide medium, and single culture of T. thioparus appear as a good filter for <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> reduction. During 24 hours, the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> reduction obtains 93 % to 16 %. When culture media added, the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulphide</b> reduction will increase almost 60 % and then the reduction decrease to 4 % after 20 hours.
