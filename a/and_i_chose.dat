500|$|Minogue {{has been}} {{involved}} in humanitarian support in areas including health research and quality of life. Musically, she has helped fundraise on many occasions. In 1989, she participated in recording [...] "Do They Know It's Christmas?" [...] under the name Band Aid II to help raise money.

500|$|Madonna also {{performed}} the song at the 2015 Brit Awards, on February 25. However, {{in the early}} stages of the performance, a wardrobe malfunction caused her to be pulled down a flight of stairs that made up part of the stage. It was later revealed that since her cape was tied tightly, when her dancers attempted to remove it from her neck, she fell down to the floor. However Madonna then continued the performance as planned. She later took to Instagram to confirm that she was well, posting [...] "Thanks for the good wishes! I'm fine". Richard Smirke from Billboard praised the performance and Madonna's recovery, saying that [...] " [...] didn't let the fall affect her performance and quickly recovered to deliver a slickly choreographed routine that mirrored the matador theme of her recent Grammy Awards performance." [...] Madonna explained on The Jonathan Ross Show that she was told to start walking towards the stage further than originally planned. Hence her team thought that the cape could have slid off and tied it tightly round her neck. The singer had two choices when the cape did not come undone, [...] "I could either be strangled or fall, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>chose</b> to fall". Madonna endured a whiplash and added that she [...] "smacked the back of my head. And I had a man standing over me with a flashlight until about 3 am to make sure I was compos mentis". The singer jokingly added that she would not use any cape for further performances and attributed her prompt recovery to having good core strength and her daily exercise routine. The accident led to an increase in viewership of the awards show. According to the British Phonographic Industry, the event resulted a 95% increase in Twitter activity about the show compared with the previous year, with an exchange of 7.8million tweets, while 6.8million viewers tuned in to watch the performance. The singer's fall was voted the most shocking [...] "Celebrity Moment of 2015" [...] by UK's Channel 5.|$|E

2500|$|Jennifer Judith Jones {{was born}} to Larry and Carol Jones who were both curlers. She also has a sister named Heather 18 months older. During her childhood, she was often {{described}} as [...] "shy".

She attended General Vanier School in South Winnipeg from kindergarten to grade 8. After, she attended Windsor Park Collegiate. At that point, Jones was proficient at Volleyball and Curling.

2500|$|After {{the race}} ended, the pit lane {{atmosphere}} became turbulent when a visibly angered Buemi went to Félix da Costa and {{accused him of}} braking his car's steering in the second turn. When Félix da Costa replied he had not made contact, Buemi walked to his teammate Frijns and engaged in a heated argument. Frijns argued he the choices he had were either to hitting Buemi's rear-wing or driving around {{the outside of the}} driver. He threatened to drive into Buemi's rear-end the next time he was anywhere near him. Buemi confronted Abt shortly after and accused the latter of hitting him deliberately. When Buemi walked away, he turned to Abt and called him [...] "a dirty guy". More than half an hour after the rant, Buemi called Audi Sport Abt [...] "a dirty team" [...] through the press and claimed the company went beyond what was allowed in the rules. Frijns was perplexed by Buemi's confrontation as he was expecting to be thanked by Buemi and believed he avoided being caught up in a more serious incident in the opening lap, [...] "I had actually already taken him before I turned in and I felt a small touch on the left rear but nothing much. Then five or six laps later he was behind me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>chose</b> to let him go so I don’t know what he is crying about." [...] Ten days after the ePrix, Buemi apologised to his team and both Andretti drivers on Twitter.|$|E
