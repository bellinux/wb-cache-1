5|$|The {{combination}} of these two opposite torques creates a resulting yaw torque on the front wheel, and its direction {{is a function of}} the side-slip <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> the tire, the angle between the actual path of the tire and the direction it is pointing, and the camber <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> the tire (the angle that the tire leans from the vertical). The result of this torque is often the suppression of the inversion speed predicted by rigid wheel models described above in the section on steady-state turning.|$|E

5|$|Ariel is {{the most}} {{reflective}} of Uranus's moons. Its surface shows an opposition surge: the reflectivity decreases from 53% at a phase <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> 0° (geometrical albedo) to 35% at an <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> about 1°. The Bond albedo of Ariel is about 23%—the highest among Uranian satellites. The surface of Ariel is generally neutral in color. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the latter appears to be redder than the former by 2%. Ariel's surface generally does not demonstrate any correlation between albedo and geology {{on the one hand}} and color on the other hand. For instance, canyons have the same color as the cratered terrain. However, bright impact deposits around some fresh craters are slightly bluer in color. There are also some slightly blue spots, which do not correspond to any known surface features.|$|E
5|$|Barchans or {{crescent}} dunes {{are produced}} by wind acting on desert sand; the two horns of the crescent and the slip face point downwind. Sand blows over the upwind face, which stands at about 15 degrees from the horizontal, and falls onto the slip face, where it accumulates up to the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> repose of the sand, which is about 35 degrees. When the slip face exceeds the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> repose, the sand avalanches, which is a nonlinear behaviour: the addition of many small amounts of sand causes nothing much to happen, but then {{the addition of a}} further small amount suddenly causes a large amount to avalanche. Apart from this nonlinearity, barchans behave rather like solitary waves.|$|E

40|$|Subsonic lateral-direction and {{longitudinal}} {{characteristics of}} a forward-swept-wing fighter configuration were examined in wind-tunnel tests at Mach numbers of 0. 2 and 0. 5 for <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> attack from - 7 to 47 deg. and over a sidelslip range of +/- 15 deg. The effects of a canard, strakes, vertical tail, and leading- and trailing-edge flaps are examined. The canard and strakes both reduce asymmetric moments and side forces at zero sideslip for <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> attack up to about 30 deg. The canard has a small influence on lateral-directional stability; however, strakes produce a substantial reduction in lateral stability for <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> attack greater than about 20 deg. The vertical tail improves directional stability for <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> attack up to 30 deg. Deflection of the leading-edge flap to 20 deg. at high <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> attack on the strake and canard configurations degrades lateral and directional stability. Deflection of the trailing-edge flap to 20 deg. on the canard configuration generally increases lateral and directional stability at high <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> attack. Leading- and trailing-edge flaps on the wing-body and canard configurations are effective for increased lift only for <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> attack up to about 40 deg. The leading-edge flap remains effective on the strake configuration over the entire angle-of-attack range tested...|$|R

5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has played}} an enormous role in refining the wings, control and sensory systems, {{and anything else}} that affects aerodynamics or kinematics. One noteworthy trait is wing twist. Most insect wings are twisted, as are helicopter blades, with a higher <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack at the base. The twist generally is between 10 and 20 degrees. In addition to this twist, the wing surfaces are not necessarily flat or featureless; most larger insects have wing membranes distorted and angled between the veins {{in such a way that}} the cross-section of the wings approximates an airfoil. Thus, the wing's basic shape already is capable of generating a small amount of lift at zero <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> attack. Most insects control their wings by adjusting tilt, stiffness, and flapping frequency of the wings with tiny muscles in the thorax (below). Some insects evolved other wing features that are not advantageous for flight, but play a role in something else, such as mating or protection.|$|E
5|$|Oberon is the second-darkest large moon of Uranus after Umbriel. Its surface shows {{a strong}} {{opposition}} surge: its reflectivity decreases from 31% at a phase <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> 0° (geometrical albedo) to 22% at an <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> about 1°. Oberon {{has a low}} Bond albedo of about 14%. Its surface is generally red in color, except for fresh impact deposits, which are neutral or slightly blue. Oberon is, in fact, the reddest among the major Uranian moons. Its trailing and leading hemispheres are asymmetrical: the latter is much redder than the former, because it contains more dark red material. The reddening of the surfaces is often a result of space weathering caused by bombardment of the surface by charged particles and micrometeorites {{over the age of}} the Solar System. However, the color asymmetry of Oberon is more likely caused by accretion of a reddish material spiraling in from outer parts of the Uranian system, possibly from irregular satellites, which would occur predominately on the leading hemisphere.|$|E
