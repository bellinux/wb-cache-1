Before <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>done,</b> she tangles with a nouveau-riche Stuart aficionado and Inspector Cameron. An entertaining blend of policing and sleuthing.|$|E
500|$|An early {{title for}} the album was When <b>All</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Said</b> <b>and</b> <b>Done</b> More Is Said Than Done, {{suggested}} by Fazzi. The group liked it, however, Fazzi said it was [...] "way too long to fit on a side of a CD". According to Lazzara, the album was given the title New Again because [...] "that's what it feels like. We are in a totally different band, just {{because there has been}} this new life breathed into the band with the addition of Matt." [...] The album was written in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Here, Rubano said the group [...] "stuck out on the street because we were so loud". For the album, the band embraced the concept that [...] "it's up to us to decide what Taking Back Sunday sounds like. We always want to be redefining what that means, and there's stuff on this record I think in the past we would have stayed away from", according to Rubano. Fazzi said the group wanted to [...] "put a new foot forward ... to show people that we're expanding the music". He noted that the song structures and chord patterns were [...] "just a bit stronger and smarter".|$|E

500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray graded [...] "Earthling" [...] with a B. Unlike Isler, the A.V. Club {{reviewer}} {{loved the}} opening, calling it [...] "one of Fringes most effective freak-meets". Murray continued {{that he believed}} the episode to be [...] "an efficient action/adventure/horror hour, heavy on suspenseful moments and neat effects, light on character development and progress on the master-plot. When <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>done</b> and Fringe eventually ends its run, I'm betting that a newcomer {{will be able to}} skip 'Earthling' without putting a dent in their overall understanding of the show. But that doesn't mean it wasn't still cool to see people get reduced to dust right in front of our eyes. Jane Boursaw from AOL TV responded negatively to the episode, wishing it had not been yet another [...] "stand-alone creature feature". While praising the special effects, Boursaw expressed disinterest in learning more about Broyles and compared the Fringe case to something already done in The X-Files. She concluded, [...] "Take the creepy alien factor out of it, and this could have been any other police procedural". UGO Networks reviewer Alex Zalben also noted similarities to The X-Files, writing that [...] "the reason [...] is weird for Fringe is that, aforementioned evidence aside, they’ve been very careful to avoid the overarching alien mythology X-Files is famous for. Oops." ...|$|E
500|$|Allgame {{said the}} {{enjoyment}} [...] "isn't bad", but limited: [...] "You can only blow {{up so much}} stuff with a helicopter." [...] Glenn Rubenstein of GameSpot in his PlayStation review called the game tired and mediocre, but reviewing the PC version, Shane Mooney wrote: [...] "I'm happy {{to say that the}} much-maligned action-heavy, plot-light genre has received a solid kick in the pants from the wonderfully fun Nuclear Strike." [...] Mooney praised the successful port from the console version and believed players would [...] "find plenty to slobber over in this extremely entertaining title." [...] Daily Radar said: [...] "When it comes to creating an action game, {{it would be nice to}} play something that requires a little bit more than just holding down the fire button continuously. In Nuclear Strike 64, that's just about all you do." [...] The website said: [...] "if all you're looking for is a game where you can fly around in a helicopter, drive a tank and manipulate 10 other vehicles in a destructive fest, well, here you go." [...] Allgame summarised: [...] "When <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>done,</b> Nuclear Strike 64 is a fine example of an excellent shooting game." [...] The reviewer believed that gamers would appreciate the game's longevity and variety. Game Revolution praised the helpful interface and responsive controls and said the mechanics were generally good, but complained of an occasionally inaccurate targeting system. The website acclaimed the [...] "perfect" [...] difficulty level. GameFan took issue with enemies shooting the player's vehicle while not visible on-screen. GameSpot's minor complaints were infrequent game saves, a [...] "too easy" [...] structure allowing supply lines to be destroyed before the main forces, a short game despite large missions and a lack of multiplayer.|$|E

2500|$|Gaudron's {{first major}} {{breakthrough}} was in 1970 with O'Shaughnessy v Mirror Newspapers Ltd, where as a 27-year-old junior counsel she successfully argued the matter single-handedly before the High Court after the plaintiff, Peter O'Shaughnessy, sacked his senior counsel, Clive Evatt QC, preferring her ability over the veteran. According to O'Shaughnessy, 'she cut a valiant figure, this [...] "slip of a girl", who stood unsupported before the five legal elders of the land. They were obviously impressed by her courage, her sheer elegant dash, her shining intellect finding expression in felicitous language, her good manners, charm, poise.

2500|$|The {{readers were}} left with a cliffhanger, not knowing the destiny of Catherine. The list would be long to add all the {{countries}} who for some unknown reasons never translated not just the seventh book, but also the sixth: A Snare for Catherine. To be fair, when <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>done</b> Catherine and a Time for love [...] had ended in 1968 with an epiloque.

2500|$|GLaDOS' {{appearance}} in Portal 2 received critical acclaim.

PALGN's Adam Ghiggino called Ellen McLain's portrayal of GLaDOS [...] "hilariously blunt" [...] due to her calling the player-character fat. He also wrote that GLaDOS has [...] "a lot of emotion to [...] movement". The Guardians Nick Cowen wrote that GLaDOS was [...] "by turns funny and monstrous". Computer and Video Game's Andy Robinson wrote that GLaDOS was [...] "surely now deserving of entry into the Best Game Characters Ever club". He added that [...] "GlaDOS's character progression is a joy to follow, as she progresses from bitter, to angry and eventually even finding a bit of heart". An editor for GameTrailers wrote that GLaDOS' [...] "constant auto-tuned barbs are extremely well-written and voiced-helping lend some character to an otherwise spartan presentation".|$|E

2500|$|In {{a review}} from Entertainment Weekly, Hilary Busis asks a [...] "Serious question: Is a Storybrooke in which everyone's suspicious, caustic, and attacking {{the people around}} them {{really going to be}} that {{different}} from the town's general status quo? (At least, as long as Grumpy is around?) We'll have to wait two long weeks for the answer to that burning (freezing?) question, thanks to the American Music Awards. At least Once prepared for its off week by giving us both halves of a two-parter—a story that, when <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>and</b> <b>done,</b> maybe didn't need to be told over the course of two hours, though it was nice to see the show take some time to privilege character over plot tonight. The hour also revealed the answers to a few of the season's long-simmering unsolved mysteries—including how Elsa ended up trapped within the anti-magic urn. Could this indicate the end of the Arendelle fairybacks, considering that backstory seems to be fairly complete at this point? If it does, will you miss them—or are you looking forward to the show not spending quite so much time on the Frozen crew?" ...|$|E
