40|$|Nonequilibrium {{dynamics}} of biomembranes with <b>active</b> <b>inclusions</b> is considered. The inclusions represent protein molecules which perform cyclic internal conformational motions {{driven by the}} energy brought with ATP ligands. As protein conformations cyclically change, this induces hydrodynamical flows and also directly affects the local curvature of a membrane. On the other hand, variations in the local curvature of the membrane modify the transitions rates between conformational states in a protein, leading to a feedback in the considered system. Moreover, <b>active</b> <b>inclusions</b> can move diffusively through the membrane so that surface concentration varies. The kinetic description of this system is constructed and {{the stability of the}} uniform stationary state is analytically investigated. We show that, as the rate of supply of chemical energy is increased above a certain threshold, this uniform state becomes unstable and stationary or traveling waves spontaneously develop in the system. Such waves are accompanied by periodic spatial variation of membrane curvature and inclusion density. For typical parameter values, their characteristic wavelengths are of the order of hundreds of nanometers. For traveling waves, the characteristic frequency is of the order of a thousand Hz or less.

40|$|A coarse-grain {{method for}} {{simulations}} {{of the dynamics}} of <b>active</b> protein <b>inclusions</b> in lipid bilayers is described. It combines the previously proposed hybrid simulations of bilayers [M. -J. Huang, R. Kapral, A. S. Mikhailov, and H. -Y. Chen, J. Chem. Phys. 137, 055101 (Year: 2012) ] 10. 1063 / 1. 4736414, based on molecular dynamics for the lipids and multi-particle collision dynamics for the solvent, with an elastic-network description of active proteins. The method is implemented for a model molecular machine which performs active conformational motions induced by ligand binding and its release after reaction. The situation characteristic for peripheral membrane proteins is considered. Statistical investigations of the effects of single <b>active</b> or passive <b>inclusions</b> on the shape of the membrane are carried out. The results show that the peripheral machine produces asymmetric perturbations of the thickness of two leaflets of the membrane. It also produces a local saddle in the midplane height of the bilayer. Analysis of the power spectrum of the fluctuations of the membrane midplane shows that the conformational motion of the machine perturbs these membrane fluctuations. The hydrodynamic lipid flows induced by cyclic conformational changes in the machine are analyzed. It is shown that such flows are long-ranged and should provide an additional important mechanism for interactions between <b>active</b> <b>inclusions</b> in biological membranes...|$|R

They are molecular machines that can function as molecular motors or carry out many other tasks in the cell. We analyze the effects that hydrodynamic flows induced by active proteins have on other passive molecules in solution or membranes. We show that the diffusion constants of passive particles are enhanced substantially. Furthermore, when gradients of active proteins are present, a chemotaxis-like drift of passive particles takes place. In lipid bilayers, the effects are strongly nonlocal, so that <b>active</b> <b>inclusions</b> in the membrane contribute to diffusion enhancement and the drift.

40|$|<b>Active</b> <b>inclusion</b> is {{a concept}} that {{challenges}} existing approaches to social policy concerned with addressing one need with one type of intervention. The elaboration of the concept to date, however, has remained mainly at broad levels of policy frameworks. Its implications for implementing bodies are far-reaching, but seemingly absent from the debate. In this think piece, we draw attention to the frontline, where street level officers and service users interact, using services for young people who are homeless or threatened with homelessness as a test case. In our discussion, we draw on findings of an action research project involving the cities of Newcastle and Hamburg. Initiatives were undertaken to find new methods by which agencies could work together to enhance the quality of services and be more sensitive to the specific situation of service users. Overall, the project demonstrated benefits of applying the <b>active</b> <b>inclusion</b> concept to conceptualizing and delivering personalized services, but it also pointed to difficulties of finding systems that could effectively meet the needs of homeless people and of identifying new methods of co-operation. Agencies involved in such strategies are typically heavily influenced by statutory or other key duties and more traditional methods of working. However, despite such difficulties, the <b>active</b> <b>inclusion</b> approach can inspire new ways of cooperation across organizational and professional boundaries, moving services closer to the specific circumstances of the people they are concerned with...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{generalized}} Timoshenko {{model has been}} developed for prismatic, beam-like slender structures with embedded or surface mounted piezoelectric type smart materials. Starting from a geometrically exact formulation of the original, three-dimensional electromechanical problem, we apply the variational asymptotic method {{to carry out a}} systematic dimensional reduction. In the process, the three-dimensional electromechanical enthalpy functional is approximated asymptotically using the slenderness as the small parameter to find out an equivalent one-dimensional electromechanical enthalpy functional. For Timoshenko-like refinement over the Euler–Bernoulli beam model, terms up to the second order of the slenderness are kept in the enthalpy expression. As an unified analysis tool, the present model can analyze embedded or surface mounted active layer with arbitrary cross-sectional geometry as two cases of a general one, no special assumptions or modifications need to be made for these two separate types of <b>active</b> <b>inclusions...</b>|$|R
40|$|In a {{one-dimensional}} elastic medium with finite correlation {{length and}} purely relaxational dynamics, we calculate the time {{dependence of the}} elastic force F(t) exchanged between two <b>active</b> <b>inclusions</b> that trigger an elastic deformation at t= 0. We consider (i) linear inclusions coupling to the field with a finite force, and (ii) non-linear inclusions imposing a finite deformation. In the non-linear case, the force exhibits a transient maximum {{much larger than the}} equilibrium force, diverging as ~L^(- 2) at separations L shorter than the field's correlation length. Both the mean-field and the Casimir component of the interaction are calculated. We also discuss the typical appearance time and equilibration time of the force, comparing the linear and the non-linear cases. The existence of a high transient force in the non-linear case should be a generic feature of elastically-mediated interactions. Comment: 10 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

Both the time-varying membrane shape, and the resulting fluid motion, result then from a balance between prescribed internal active stresses, internal passive resistance, and external viscous stresses. We introduce two specific models for such active internal forcing: one where a distribution of active bending moments is prescribed, and one where <b>active</b> <b>inclusions</b> exert normal stresses on the membrane by pumping fluid through it.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) in hybrid metal-dielectric waveguides. The embedding of metal in nanostructured photonic components allows for manipulating and guiding light at the subwavelength scale. Such an extreme confinement enhances the nonlinear response of the dielectric medium, which is important for applications in optical processing of information, but is paid in terms of considerable ohmic loss in the metal. It is, however, possible to embed externally pumped <b>active</b> <b>inclusions</b> in the dielectric in order {{to compensate for the}} metal loss. A novel perturbative theory for Maxwell equations is introduced and applied to various nonlinear metal-dielectric structures, deriving the propagation equation for the optical field. The nonlinear dispersion law for amplified SPPs, filamentation and dissipative plasmon-soliton formation have been studied, revealing intrinsic core and tail instabilities that prevent solitons to propagate over long distances. Stable propagation of plasmon-solitons can be achieved in insulator-metal-insulator structures with active and passive interfaces. The active SPP is coupled with the passive SPP, which absorbs the perturbations destabilising the zero background of the soliton. Theoretical modelling of optical propagation in metal-dielectric stacks predicts a modified two-band structure, allowing for gap/discrete plasmon-soliton formation. Loss and nonlinear parameters in subwavelength nanowire waveguides are evaluated and compared to the results obtained by other research groups. In all calculations, particular attention is paid in considering boundary conditions accounting for loss and nonlinear corrections, which contribute to the propagation equation with a surface term that becomes significant in the subwavelength regime.
