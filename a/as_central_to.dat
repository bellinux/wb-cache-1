5|$|Beth Hamedrash was the prototypical American synagogue {{for early}} {{immigrant}} Eastern European Jews, who began entering the United States {{in large numbers}} only in the 1870s. They found the synagogues of the German Jewish immigrants who preceded them to be unfamiliar, both religiously and culturally. Russian Jews in particular had been more excluded from Russian society than were German Jews from German society, for both linguistic and social reasons. Unlike German Jews, the Jews who founded Beth Hamedrash viewed both religion and the synagogue <b>as</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> their lives. They attempted to re-create in Beth Hamedrash the kind of synagogue they had belonged to in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists {{join the}} UN {{and others in}} {{acknowledging}} care work, {{as a kind of}} work which includes all tasks involving caregiving, <b>as</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> economic development and human well-being. Feminist economists study both paid and unpaid care work. They argue that traditional analysis of economics often ignores the value of household unpaid work. Feminist economists have argued that unpaid domestic work is as valuable as paid work, so measures of economic success should include unpaid work. They have shown that women are disproportionately responsible for performing such care work.|$|E
5|$|The Italian {{artist and}} critic Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574) first {{used the term}} rinascita {{retrospectively}} in his book The Lives of the Artists (published 1550). In the book Vasari attempted to define {{what he described as}} a break with the barbarities of gothic art: the arts (he held) had fallen into decay {{with the collapse of the}} Roman Empire and only the Tuscan artists, beginning with Cimabue (1240–1301) and Giotto (1267–1337) began to reverse this decline in the arts. Vasari saw antique art <b>as</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> the rebirth of Italian art.|$|E

5|$|Earlier historians, {{including}} Beale, {{believed that}} money drove events, {{and had seen}} Reconstruction as an economic struggle. They also accepted, for the most part, that reconciliation between North and South {{should have been the}} top priority of Reconstruction. In the 1950s, historians began to focus on the African-American experience <b>as</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> Reconstruction. They rejected completely any claim of black inferiority, which had marked many earlier historical works, and saw the developing Civil Rights Movement as a second Reconstruction; some writers stated they hoped their work on the postbellum era would advance the cause of civil rights. These authors sympathized with the Radical Republicans for their desire to help the African American, and saw Johnson as callous towards the freedman. In a number of works from 1956 onwards by such historians as Fawn Brodie, the former president was depicted as a successful saboteur of efforts to better the freedman's lot. These volumes included major biographies of Stevens and Stanton. Reconstruction was increasingly seen as a noble effort to integrate the freed slaves into society.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{has been}} seen <b>as</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> the pathology of schizophrenia, both in the neural and physiological effects. It has been generally accepted {{that there is an}} abnormal synaptic connectivity underlying schizophrenia. Several lines of evidence implicate changes in the synaptic organization and connectivity, in and from the hippocampus Many studies have found dysfunction in the synaptic circuitry within the hippocampus and its activity on the prefrontal cortex. The glutamatergic pathways have been seen to be largely affected. The subfield CA1 is seen to be the least involved of the other subfields, and CA4 and the subiculum have been reported elsewhere as being the most implicated areas. The review concluded that the pathology could be due to genetics, faulty neurodevelopment or abnormal neural plasticity. It was further concluded that schizophrenia is not due to any known neurodegenerative disorder.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{problems}} with viewing attachment as a trait (stable characteristic of an individual) {{rather than as}} a type of behaviour with organising functions and outcomes, led some authors to the conclusion that attachment behaviours were best understood in terms of their functions in the child's life. This way of thinking saw the secure base concept <b>as</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> attachment theory's logic, coherence, and status as an organizational construct. Following this argument, the assumption that attachment is expressed identically in all humans cross-culturally was examined. The research showed that though there were cultural differences, the three basic patterns, secure, avoidant and ambivalent, can be found in every culture in which studies have been undertaken, even where communal sleeping arrangements are the norm.Selection of the secure pattern is found in the majority of children across cultures studied. This follows logically from the fact that attachment theory provides for infants to adapt to changes in the environment, selecting optimal behavioural strategies. How attachment is expressed shows cultural variations which need to be ascertained before studies can be undertaken; for example Gusii infants are greeted with a handshake rather than a hug. Securely attached Gusii infants anticipate and seek this contact. There are also differences in the distribution of insecure patterns based on cultural differences in child-rearing practices. The scholar Michael Rutter in 1974 studied the importance of distinguishing between the consequences of attachment deprivation upon intellectual retardation in children and lack of development in the emotional growth in children. Rutter's conclusion was that a careful delineation of maternal attributes needed to be identified and differentiated for progress in the field to continue.|$|E

Unlike essentially omnipotent entities, {{it is possible for}} an accidentally omnipotent being to be non-omnipotent. This raises the question, however, {{of whether or not the}} being was ever truly omnipotent, or just capable of great power. On the other hand, the ability to voluntarily give up great power is often thought of <b>as</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> the notion of the Christian Incarnation.|$|E
25|$|Otto F. Kernberg (1967) {{developed}} {{a theory of}} borderline personality organization of which one consequence may be borderline personality disorder.

Kernberg views the use of primitive defence mechanisms <b>as</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> this personality organization. Primitive psychological defences are projection, denial, dissociation or splitting and they are called borderline defence mechanisms. Also, devaluation and projective identification are seen as borderline defences.|$|E
25|$|Following a phenomenological {{study of}} nine {{individuals}} involved in sexual masochistic sessions who regarded pain <b>as</b> <b>central</b> <b>to</b> their experience, sexual masochism {{was described as}} an addiction-like tendency, with several features resembling that of drug addiction: craving, intoxication, tolerance and withdrawal. It was also demonstrated how the first masochistic experience is placed on a pedestal, with subsequent use aiming at retrieving this lost sensation, much {{as described in the}} descriptive literature on addiction. The addictive pattern presented in this study suggests an association with behavioral spin as found in problem gamblers.|$|E

His very successful and profitable time sales to the Pennsylvania Railroad stood out among the many non-government based observatories of the day who were largely subsidizing their researches by time-service sales to regional railroads and the cities they served.
