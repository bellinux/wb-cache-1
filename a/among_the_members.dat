Hugh Cott was chief instructor; the artist camouflage officers, who called themselves camoufleurs, included Steven Sykes and Tony Ayrton. In Australia, artists were also prominent in the Sydney Camouflage Group, formed under the chairmanship of Professor William John Dakin, a zoologist from Sydney University.

Brownlee's vision, unique <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of the Macmillan Commission, of a publicly controlled central bank became a reality in 1938, when the Bank of Canada shifted from private to government control.|$|E
5|$|Following his ousting, Peter the Venetian {{took refuge}} in Germany. In response, Samuel stormed Austria in 1042, {{provoking}} a retaliatory invasion by the German monarch, Henry III in 1043. It forced Samuel to renounce all Hungarian territories {{to the west of}} the rivers Leitha and Morava as well as agree to the payment of a tribute. The funding of the tribute payment was through new taxes on the Christian prelates and seizure of Church estates. This policy caused discontent even <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of Samuel's own council. He had a number of his councillors executed during Lent. In order to punish the king, Bishop Gerard of Csanád (modern-day Cenad, Romania) refused to perform the annual ceremony of putting the royal crown Gerard upon the monarch's head at Easter.|$|E

5|$|In Wallonia, {{literature}} in French began a revival in 1881 {{with the creation}} of the La Jeune Belgique ("The Young Belgium") movement, which supported the creation of distinctively Belgian literature and opposed romanticism. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>members</b> of the Jeune Belgique were the writer Camille Lemonnier, whose works were often set against the background of Belgian peasant life in the naturalist style, and the poet Charles Van Lerberghe. French language poetry flourished in Belgium in the early 20th century under Émile Verhaeren and Maurice Maeterlinck; Maeterlinck was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1911.|$|E
5|$|Like the sassabies, {{hartebeest}} produce quiet quacking and grunting sounds. Juveniles {{tend to be}} {{more vocal}} than adults, and produce a quacking call when alarmed or pursued.

PhilipII in turn defeated Onomarchus in 352BC at the Battle of Crocus Field, which led to PhilipII's election as leader (archon) of the Thessalian League, provided him a seat on the Amphictyonic Council, and allowed for a marriage alliance with Pherae by wedding Nicesipolis, niece of the tyrant Jason of Pherae.|$|E
