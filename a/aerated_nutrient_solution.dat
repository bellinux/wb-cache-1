An examination of pods and submerged portions of gynophore surfaces by scanning electron microscopy showed the presence of two distinctly different protuberances: unicellular root-hair-like structures that first developed from epidermal cells of the gynophores and developing pods; and branched septate hairs that developed later from cells below the epidermal layer. The septate hairs became visible only after the epidermal and associated unicellular structures had been shed by the expanding gynophore and pods.

Plants (three months old) were grown in <b>aerated</b> <b>nutrient</b> <b>solutions</b> under greenhouse conditions. Reduction of nitrate was estimated {{both in the}} leaves and in the roots by: (a) accumulation of nitrite in vitro, (b) accumulation of nitrite in vivo and (c) disappearance of nitrate in vivo. Disappearance of nitrate in vivo offered the closest estimation of the rate of nitrate reduction. Leaves consistently showed rates of nitrate reduction lower than those in roots, regardless of assay method. Lowering root temperature had no marked effect on the {{distribution of}} nitrate reductase activity in the plant; increasing nitrate concentration in the shoot, however, markedly increased leaf nitrate reduction. The relatively low level of nitrate reductase in leaves appears to be caused mainly by a limitation of nitrate transport from root to shoot.

Plants were grown with (+Fe-treated) or without (−Fe-treated) added Fe(III) -N,N'-ethylenebis[2 -(2 -hydroxyphenyl) glycine] in <b>aerated</b> <b>nutrient</b> <b>solutions.</b> Daily measurements of Fe(III) reduction indicated a four-to seven-fold higher reduction rate in +Fe- or −Fe-treated E 107, and −Fe-treated Sparkle, when compared with +Fe-treated Sparkle. An agarose-based staining technique used to localize Fe(III) reduction, revealed Fe(III) reduction {{over most of the}} length of the roots (but not at the root apices) in both E 107 treatments and −Fe-treated Sparkle. In +Fe-treated Sparkle, Fe(III) reduction was either nonexistent or localized to central regions of the roots. Measurements of short-term Fe influx (with 0. 1 millimolar 59 Fe(III) -ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) was also enhanced (threefold) in +Fe- or −Fe-treated E 107 and −Fe-treated Sparkle, relative to +Fe-treated Sparkle. The physiological characteristics of E 107 root systems, which are similar to those seen in Fe-deficient Sparkle, have led us to conclude that the mutation causes E 107 to act functionally as an Fe-deficient plant, and appears to explain the excess Fe accumulation in E 107...|$|R
40|$|It was {{previously}} reported that tuber initiation is restricted in soil-less production systems owing {{to a lack}} of mechanical resistance and that a low-pH shock treatment over a 10 -h period alleviated this problem. Tuber initiation was investigated under soil-less conditions by growing single-stemmed Van der Plank potato plants in standard <b>aerated</b> <b>nutrient</b> <b>solutions</b> (EC 1. 3 mS cm- 1, pH 5. 5) in two-litre containers. The pH of the <b>nutrient</b> <b>solution</b> was changed by replacing the standard solution with solutions at pH levels of 3. 0, 3. 5 and 4. 0 for 1 0 -h periods, 25 and 35 days after transplanting. Apart from these low-pH treatments, a treatment where the <b>nutrient</b> <b>solution</b> was replaced with a solution containing no calcium (pH 5. 5) was also included. Tuber initiation under the influence of these treatments was compared to that of a standard <b>nutrient</b> <b>solution.</b> All plants were harvested 45 days after transplanting. A tuber tip with a diameter more than double the diameter of the stolon was regarded as a tuber. Conditions in the greenhouse were favourable for tuber induction.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effects of}} {{salinity}} on the germinability and growth of three Lolium perenne cultivars (Barminton, Barrage and Barlennium), differing in tolerance to salinity, were considered. Twelve-days-old plants were grown in <b>aerated</b> <b>nutrient</b> <b>solution</b> (NS) free of (control) or supplemented with 10, 15, or 20 g L- 1 NaCl, or with two different concentrations of biostimulant. The germinability and the growth of seedlings were both increased {{in the presence of the}} biostimulant, while the salinity influenced the two parameters in relation to cv and NaCl concentrations. In particular 10 and 15 g L- 1 NaCl decreased the growth of three cultivars, while the presence of the biostimulant mitigated the toxic effect of salt. 20 g L- 1 NaCl did not allow seed germination. In order to better understand the physiological action of NaCl, two different enzymes (-amylase, invertase) involved in seed germination and plant development, were analyzed. In particular, -amylase activity is involved in the hydrolysis of sucrose into hexose substrate, while invertase is implicated in differentiation and growth processes. The roles of NaCl and biostimulant on these activities are investigated...|$|E
40|$|Most {{plant species}} are {{sensitive}} to high ammonium concentrations. In this experiment the sensitivity of lettuce and spinach to ammonium was investigated. In a factorial experiment with framework of a completely randomized design with two factors, nitrogen form (ammonium and nitrate) and plant species (lettuce and spinach), and three replications seeds were germinated {{in a mixture of}} perlite, sand and clay in soil-maid pots. After two weeks, the seedlings at two true-leaf stage were then transferred to buckets containing 4 L of <b>aerated</b> <b>nutrient</b> <b>solution.</b> The four plants were growing together. The treatments were ammonium and nitrate at 5 mM. In comparison to nitrate, ammonium reduced the growth of both species. Concentration of K, Mg, and Na decreased with ammonium in both species. The reduction of K and Mg concentrations in ammonium-fed plants may have a role in ammonium toxicity. Ammonium nutrition of both species caused an increase in P at roots and shoots. Higher P content at ammonium-fed lettuce and spinach plants may be due to creation of cations and anions balance in plants. Chlorophyll a and b were higher in ammonium-fed than nitrate-fed plants...|$|E
40|$|Studies on the {{mechanisms}} of hypoxic adaptation of barley seedling related to total sugar and nitrogen accumulation in the shoots were carried out at Lampang Agricultural Research and Training Center during March-April 1999.

Results revealed two principal steps in their responses. First step was at 0 - 5 days after hypoxia, the root system survived by increasing alcohol dehydrogenase activity for anaerobic respiration in the roots and nitrate reductase activity in the leaves also increased but lower than the control. The total soluble sugar and nitrogen accumulation in the shoots varied among barley genotypes. In the second step (5 - 9 days after hypoxia), the phytosynthetic rates of all genotypes were increased which depended on the chlorophyll efficiency in leaves. Total soluble sugar in the shoots increased whereas total nitrogen in the shoots decreased. Alcohol dehydrogenase and nitrate reductase activities were different among barley genotypes...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the responses of leaf elongation rate (LER), turgor and osmotic adjustment (OA) during a short-term stress (7 hours) imposed by PEG 6000 and a recovery phase, three durum wheat (Triticum durum L.) varieties [Inrat; MBB; and OZ] were grown in <b>aerated</b> <b>nutrient</b> <b>solutions.</b> Leaf elongation kinetics of leaf 3 was estimated using LVDT. Turgor was estimated using a cell pressure probe; osmotic potential as well as total sugars and potassium (K+) concentrations were estimated from expressed sap of elongation zone. Growth recovered rapidly and then stabilised at a lower value. A {{significant difference was found}} in % recovery of LER between the varieties. The cessation of growth after stress coincided with a decrease in turgor followed by a recovery period reaching control values in MBB and Inrat. A strong correlation (R 2 = 0. 83) between the reduction in turgor (Δ turgor) and % recovery of LER was found at 7 hours after stress. The difference in the partial recovery of LER between varieties was thus related to the capacity of partial turgor recovery. Partial turgor recovery is associated with sugar or K+ based OA which indicates its importance in maintaining high LER values under water deficit...|$|R

Barley plants (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Clipper) were grown hydroponically under controlled environmental conditions. The <b>aerated</b> <b>nutrient</b> <b>solutions</b> contained 2 mM inorganic ¹⁴N supplied as either nitrate alone, ammonium alone, a 1 : 1 nitrate plus ammonium mixture or a 3 : 1 nitrate plus ammonium mixture. After 20 days of growth ¹⁵N <b>nutrient</b> <b>solutions</b> were substituted. The plant material was harvested four and eight hours after the commencement of the ¹⁵N feeding experiment and prepared for analysis.

Separate batches of plants were used for harvesting and sap collection. In nitrate-fed plants the shoot was shown to be the main organ of nitrate assimilation. Xylem sap analysis indicated that 66 % of the ¹⁵N supply to the shoot was in the form of nitrate and the majority of the absorbed and assimilated ¹⁵N was located in this region. In ammonium-fed plants, however, ¹⁵N-ammonium accumulated in the root with only a very small amount detectable in the xylem sap. Some 93 % of the ¹⁵N exported from root to shoot in the xylem stream was in the form of organic nitrogen (mainly glutamine).

Plants were grown in long-day conditions in an <b>aerated</b> <b>nutrient</b> <b>solution</b> culture system placed in three identical climate chambers. Night/day temperature treatments were 18 °/ 18 °C (control), 12 °/ 18 °C, and 8 °/ 18 °C, respectively. Chrysanthemum morifolium had the same dry matter (DM) production in the three treatments; however, plants grown with low night temperature treatments formed fewer leaves and their total leaf area decreased. In contrast, low night temperatures increased leaf DM content at the expense of root DM content. This was explained, in part, by starch accumulation, which occurred because the starch synthesised during the photoperiod did not disappear during the dark period. Low night temperatures decreased the N concentration in plants; however, this reduction was limited and explained, in part, by starch accumulation in the leaves. Daily plant NO 3 – uptake was not affected by low night temperatures, although the NO 3 – uptake rate was lower during the night when plants were grown at 8 °C, possibly due to a decrease in transpiration.

Endogenous concentration of JA was not affected in both roots and shoots of SR 03, but it was increased in the roots of Across 8023 during the first phase of salt stress. In the second experiment, 6 d old maize seedlings were grown with or without 30 µM JA in the root medium. Exogenous treatment of JA, significantly reduced the maize seedling growth in terms of shoot extension, root length and root and shoot fresh weights.

Proton flux along the root elongation zone was assayed by high resolution analyses {{of images of}} acid diffusion around roots contacted for 5 min with pH indicator gel. Profiles of root segmental elongation correlated qualitatively and quantitatively (r 2 = 0. 74) with proton flux along {{the surface of the}} elongation zone from water-deficit and control treatments. Proton flux and segmental elongation in roots under water deficit were remarkably well maintained in the region 0 to 3 mm behind the root tip and were inhibited from 3 to 10 mm behind the tip. Associated changes in apoplastic pH inside epidermal cell walls were measured in three defined regions along the root elongation zone by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a ratiometric method. Finally, external acidification of roots was shown to specifically induce a partial reversal of growth inhibition by water deficit in the central region of the elongation zone. These new findings, plus evidence in the literature concerning increases induced by acid pH in wall-extensibility parameters, lead us to propose that the apparently adaptive maintenance of growth 0 to 3 mm behind the tip in maize primary roots under water deficit and the associated inhibition of growth further behind the tip are related to spatially variable changes in proton pumping into expanding cell walls...|$|E

30|$|Using {{microorganisms}} {{that specifically}} consume crude oil as their sole carbon source in MEOR processes {{could be a}} way of avoiding the need to add molasses. These microorganisms can break long-chain hydrocarbons in crude oil into shorter chains, resulting in a decrease in the oil viscosity and improved oil mobility. Lazar et al. (1999) suggested that microorganisms could be used to decrease the proportion of long-chain n-alkanes present in biotechnological processes that involve waxy crude oil, to improve the recovery of the oil. Yijiang et al. (1999) described a successful MEOR field trial using oil-degrading bacteria without the injection of any nutrients. They concluded that the oil recovery was enhanced because of a decrease in the oil viscosity caused by the injected bacteria. However, a number of unknown bacterial strains had been injected into the reservoir in that study, and it is unclear which bacteria had caused the decrease in viscosity, so the reproducibility of the effects was left as an open question. Later, single species of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, including Bacillus spp. (Wankui et al. 2006), Brevibacillus spp. (Wang et al. 2008), Pseudomonas spp. (Sadeghazad and Ghaemi 2003), and Acinetobacter spp. (Kotlar et al. 2007), were used in MEOR. However, all of these species are aerobic and/or facultative anaerobic bacteria, and need oxygen to degrade the hydrocarbons. To achieve this, an <b>aerated</b> <b>nutrient</b> <b>solution</b> was, therefore, injected into the oil reservoirs in the MEOR field trials using aerobic bacteria (Youssef et al. 2009). Using this method, the growth of the bacteria was limited to near the injection wells because the dissolved oxygen was entirely consumed there. This resulted in the oil viscosity only decreasing near the injection wells, so the enhancement in the oil recovery was not particularly great. Using anaerobic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in MEOR would, therefore, {{be a way of}} improving the MEOR performance.|$|E

Two experiments were conducted under glasshouse conditions with seedlings transplanted in <b>aerated</b> stagnant <b>nutrient</b> <b>solution</b> (floating raft system) four weeks after emergence. The nitrate/ammonium ratio in the <b>nutrient</b> <b>solution</b> did not affect plant growth or dry matter partitioning, but it influenced the concentration of determined metabolites; in particular, the root concentrations of chlorogenic acid, echinacoside and caffeic acid were significantly higher in the plants grown with nitrate as sole source of nitrogen. NaCl salinity reduced plant growth, by reducing the biomass allocated to the inflorescences, and enhanced the accumulation of chlorogenic acid and cichoric acids, at least in the roots...|$|R

40|$|Growth of most {{crop plants}} (glycophytes) is reduced in saline environments. A few plant species (eu{{halophyte}}s) not only tolerate, but require salt, and grow optimally in salinities between 100 and 200 mM NaCl. The halophyte Salicornia bigelovii Torr. shows optimal growth in 200 mM NaCl and reduced growth in low saline conditions. In spite {{of years of}} research, mechanisms that confer salt tolerance to some plants and sensitivity to others are poorly understood. This research was undertaken to obtain physiological information {{in an attempt to}} determine why S. bigelovii requires salt to reach maximum growth. Salicornia seedlings were grown in the greenhouse in <b>aerated</b> <b>nutrient</b> <b>solutions</b> with 5, 200 or 600 mM NaCl. Plants grown in 200 mM NaCl showed optimal growth. Fresh and dry weight of the plants were reduced when grown in 5 and 600 mM NaCl. The main differences in plants grown in 5 and 600 mM NaCl had to do with ion accumulation. These differences in ion accumulation suggested that salt tolerance in Salicornia was established by regulation of ion transport. This was confirmed by studying two primary transport systems in plants grown in 5 or 200 mM NaCl. These transport systems are the H⁺-ATPases on the plasma membrane (PM-ATPase) and the tonoplast (V-ATPase). Higher PM-ATPase (55 %) activities were observed in 200 mM NaCl grown plants. Increases in growth and in PM-ATPase activity in Salicornia shoots after exposure to salinity were highly correlated. V-ATPase activity was significantly stimulated in vivo and in vitro (26 and 46 %) after exposure to 200 mM NaCl, and this stimulation was Na⁺-specific. Increased V-ATPase activity was consistent with an increased Na⁺ accumulation (45 %) compared to plants grown in 5 mM NaCl. Na⁺-stimulation of ATPases may confer salt tolerance in Salicornia by providing the driving force for regulation of intracellular Na⁺ levels. The ATPases provide an increased H⁺ electrochemical gradient across membranes that may be used by the Na⁺/H⁺ exchangers on the plasma membrane and tonoplast. In addition, H⁺ transport across the plasma membrane leads to acidification of the apoplast that is required for cell wall extension and growth. These transport systems need to work in concert for optimal growth and salt tolerance...|$|R
40|$|Plants of Helianthus annuus {{were grown}} in soil in pots such that {{approximately}} 30 % {{of the root}} system protruded through {{the base of the}} pot. After 7 d further growth in <b>aerated</b> <b>nutrient</b> <b>solution,</b> the attached, protruding roots were air-dried for 10 - 15 min and thereafter surrounded with moist still air, in the dark, for 49 h, whilst the soil was kept at field capacity. The roots of the control plants remained in the nutrient solution throughout the experiment. This treatment rapidly reduced the water content of protruding roots from 205 to 17 - 8 g g" ' dry mass (DM), which remained less than that of the control roots {{for the rest of the}} experiment. This treatment also reduced root turgor and water potential. The abscisic acid (ABA) concentrations in the protruding roots, xylem sap and leaves of the treated plants increased significantly, compared to values recorded for control plants. In treated roots, the ABA concentration was significantly increased 4 h after treatment, with a maximum of 4 - 4 + 0 - 1 nmol g" 1 (DM) after 25 h.

40|$|Plants of Helianthus annuus were pot-grown in soil, with {{approximately}} 30 % {{of the root}} system protruding through the base. After 7 d, {{the upper part of}} the root system of half of the plants was exposed to drought (internal roots) while the lower part was kept in <b>aerated</b> <b>nutrient</b> <b>solution</b> (protruding root). The treatment rapidly reduced the internal roots' water content from 26. 1 to 21. 9 g g− 1 dry weight (DW), while in protruding roots of stressed plants it slowly and continuously decreased from 31. 9 to 25. 2 g g− 1 DW. Leaf water content rapidly decreased in treated plants from 7. 4 to 6. 4 g g− 1 DW in the first 2 d and then reached a plateau. In stressed plants leaf stomatal resistance was significantly higher in the first 3 d while leaf water potential was lower only on the last day. Abscisic acid (ABA) concentration in treated plants increased significantly compared to the controls. In treated internal roots, ABA rose from the first day, reaching a maximum of 1. 48 ± 0. 49 nmol g− 1 DW after 3 d. In treated protruding roots a maximum of 0. 99 ± 0. 09 nmol g− 1 DW was reached after 1 d. ABA concentration in the xylem sap increased 2 d and 3 d after the start of soil drying, with a maximum of 113 ± 12 nmol l− 1 during the third day.

A tolerância foi medida pela capacidade das raízes primárias continuarem a crescer em solução sem alumínio, após 48 horas em solução contendo uma concentração conhecida de alumínio. Todos os cultivares de centeio Branco, Bagé, FA (In Chansti), Soron, Padrela, Montalegre, Vila Pouco de Aguiar, Gimonde e Lamego e os cultivares de trigo BH- 1146 e IAC- 227 foram considerados muito tolerantes, por exibirem crescimento radicular após o tratamento em solução contendo 20 mgL- 1 de Al 3 +. Os genotipos de centeio Padrela, Montalegre e Vila Pouco de Aguiar foram os mais tolerantes, em função dos seus maiores índices de tolerância relativa.
