40|$|The {{dynamics}} of atom lasers with a continuous output coupler based on two-photon Raman transitions is investigated. With {{the help of}} the time-convolutionless projection operator technique the quantum master equations for pulsed and continuous wave (cw) atom lasers are derived. In the case of the pulsed atom laser the power of the time-convolutionless projection operator technique is demonstrated through comparison with the exact solution. It is shown that in an intermediate coupling regime where the Born-Markov approximation fails the results of this algorithm agree with the exact solution. To study the {{dynamics of}} a continuous wave atom laser <b>a</b> <b>pump</b> <b>mechanism</b> is included in the model. Whereas the pump mechanism is treated within the Born-Markov approximation, the output coupling leads to non-Markovian effects. The solution of the master equation resulting from the time-convolutionless projection operator technique exhibits strong oscillations in the occupation number of the Bose-Einstein condensate. These oscillations are traced back to a quantum interference which is due to the non-Markovian dynamics and which decays slowly in time {{as a result of the}} dispersion relation for massive particles.

40|$|N-acetyl-l-histidine (NAH) is a {{prominent}} biomolecule in brain, retina and lens of poikilothermic vertebrates. In fish lens, NAH exhibits an unusual compartmentalized metabolism. It is synthesized from L-histidine (His) and acetyl Co-enzyme A. However, NAH cannot be catabolized by lens cells. For its hydrolysis, NAH is exported to ocular fluid where a specific acylase cleaves His {{which is then}} actively taken up by lens and re-synthesized into NAH. This energy-dependent cycling suggested <b>a</b> <b>pump</b> <b>mechanism</b> operating at the lens/ocular fluid interface. Additional studies led to the hypothesis that NAH functioned as a molecular water pump (MWP) to maintain a highly dehydrated lens and avoid cataract formation. In this process, each NAH molecule released to ocular fluid down its gradient carries with it 33 molecules of bound water, effectively transporting the water against a water gradient. In ocular fluid the bound water is released for removal from the eye {{by the action of}} NAH acylase.

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{possibility}} of a proton-motive efflux pump for quinolones in highly quinolone-resistant clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), we studied 3 H-norfloxacin uptake in two quinolone-resistant and two quinolone-sensitive strains of MRSA whose gyrA region surrounding amino acid codons 84 and 85 had been sequenced. Two strains were related (one sensitive and one resistant) in that both were recovered from a single patient, one before (sensitive) and one after (resistant) ciprofloxacin therapy. Drug uptake was assessed in four separate experiments running triplicate bacterial suspensions with radiolabeled drug added at time = 0. Sampling was performed in 10 min increments up to 50 min by a vacuum filtration method. The ionic uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCPH), was added at 40 min to test inhibition of <b>a</b> <b>pump</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The results demonstrated no statistically significant differences in uptake between the sensitive and resistant groups, and the uptake patterns were similar. CCCPH also induced an equivalent surge, or enhanced uptake among these strains, rendering an energy-dependent efflux pump an unlikely contributor to the high levels of resistance seen in our strains.

Connection between the pumping characteristics and associated mechanisms is established. The pumping potential is generated by ac biasing the FGA pair. For a single pair (N= 1) of finger gates (FG's), the <b>pumping</b> <b>mechanism</b> is due to the coherent inelastic scattering of the traversing electron to its subband threshold.

40|$|A {{reliable}} micro gas <b>pump</b> is <b>an</b> {{essential element}} {{to the development}} of many micro-systems for chemical gas analyses. At Sandia, the authors are exploring <b>a</b> different <b>pumping</b> <b>mechanism,</b> gas transport by thermal transpiration. Thermal transpiration refers to the rarefied gas dynamics developed in a micro-channel with a longitudinal temperature gradient. To investigate the potential of thermal transpiration for gas pumping in micro-systems, the authors have performed simulations and model analysis to design micro-devices and to assess their design performance before the fabrication process. The effort is to apply ICARUS (a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo code developed at Sandia) to characterize the fluid transport and evaluate the design performance. The design being considered has two plenums at different temperatures (hot and cold) separated by a micro-channel of 0. 1 micron wide and 1 micron long. The temperature difference between the two plenums is 30 kelvin. ICARUS results, a quasi-steady analysis, predicts a net flow through the micro-channel with a velocity magnitude of about 0. 4 m/s due to temperature gradient at the wall (thermal creep flow) at the early time. Later as the pressure builds up in the hot plenum, flow is reversed. Eventually when the system reaches steady state equilibrium, the net flow becomes zero. The thermal creep effect is compensated by the thermo-molecular pressure effect. This result demonstrates {{that it is important to}} include the thermo-molecular pressure effect when designing <b>a</b> <b>pumping</b> <b>mechanism</b> based on thermal transpiration.
