One of these possible applications is the use of nanorovers (robotic vehicles with a mass of order one kilogram or less) in planetary exploration. NASA and Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) are cooperating on the first mission to collect samples from the surface of an asteroid and return them to Earth for in-depth study. The ISAS MUSES-C mission will be launched on a Japanese launch vehicle in July 2002 from Japan toward a rendez-vous with the asteroid 1989 ML in September 2003. A NASA-provided nanorover will conduct in-situ measurements on the surface. With a mass of about one kilogram, the rover experiment will be a direct descendant of the technology used to build the Sojourner rover. The rover will carry three science instruments: (1) a visible imaging camera, (2) a near-infrared point spectrometer, and (3) an <b>alpha</b> X <b>ray</b> <b>spectrometer.</b> The solar-powered rover will move around the surface of 1989 ML collecting imagery data, which are complimentary to the spacecraft investigation. The imaging system will be capable of making surface texture, composition, and morphology measurements at resolutions better than one millimeter. The rover will transmit this data to the spacecraft for relay back to Earth. Due to the microgravity environment on 1989 ML, the rover has been designed to right itself in case it flips over.

40|$|Because the <b>alpha</b> proton X <b>ray</b> <b>spectrometer</b> (APXS) {{sensor head}} on the Mars Pathfinder rover, Sojourner, is placed on Martian soil by the {{deployment}} mechanism (ADM), the rover would be crippled if the actuator fails when the mechanism is in its deployed position, as rover ground clearance is then reduced to zero. This paper describes the unique fail-safe mounted on the ADM, especially {{the use of a}} low-temperature-melting alloy as a coupler device. The final form of the design is a low-melting-point metal pellet coupler, made from Cerrobend, in parallel with a Negator spring pack. In its solid state, the metal rigidly connects the driver (the actuator) and the driven part (the mechanism). When commanded, a strip heater wrapped around the coupler melts the metal pellet (at 60 (deg) C), allowing the driven part to turn independent of the driver. The Negator spring retracts the mechanism to its fully stowed position. This concept meets all the design criteria, and provides an added benefit. When the metal hardens the coupler once again rigidly connects the actuator and the mechanism. The concept presented here can easily be applied to other applications. Anywhere release devices are needed, low-melting-point couplers can be considered. The issues to be concerned with are thermal isolation, proper setting of the parts before actuation, and possible outgassing concerns. However, when these issues are overcome, the resulting release mechanism can promise to be the most light, simple, power conserving alternative available...|$|R

In addition to the rover, which also performs a number of technology experiments, Pathfinder carries three science instruments: a stereoscopic imager with spectral filters on an extendable mast, an <b>alpha</b> proton X <b>ray</b> <b>spectrometer,</b> and an atmospheric structure instrument/meteorology package.

Landing downstream from the mouth of a giant catastrophic outflow channel, Ares Vallis at 19. 5 deg N, 32. 8 deg W, offers the potential of identifying and analyzing a wide variety of crustal materials, from the ancient heavily cratered terrain, intermediate-aged ridged plains, and reworked channel deposits, thus allowing first-order scientific investigations of the early differentiation and evolution of the crust, the development of weathering products, and tile early environments and conditions on Mars...|$|R

The damage of <b>alpha</b> <b>rays</b> is one and three orders of magnitude larger than for protons and electrons. The radiation source dependence of the performance degradation is attributed to the difference of mass and the probability of nuclear collisions for the formation of lattice defects. Poly-Si resistors are more rad-hard than base resistors. This is mainly due to the thickness difference of the junction and the oxide. The trap density for <b>alpha</b> <b>rays</b> is larger than for protons and that a negligible fluence dependence is observed.
