2500|$|The {{causes of}} {{schizophrenia}} {{have been the}} subject of much debate, with various factors proposed and discounted or modified. The language of schizophrenia research under the medical model is scientific. [...] Such studies suggest that genetics, prenatal development, early environment, neurobiology and psychological and social processes are important contributory factors. Current psychiatric research into the development of the disorder is often based on a neurodevelopmental model [...] (proponents of which see schizophrenia as a syndrome.) However, schizophrenia is diagnosed on the basis of symptom profiles. Neural correlates do not provide sufficiently useful criteria. [...] "Current research into schizophrenia has remained highly fragmented, much like the clinical presentation of the disease itself". The one thing that researchers can <b>agree</b> <b>on</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> schizophrenia is a complicated and variable condition. It is best thought of as a syndrome, a cluster of symptoms that may or may not have related causes, rather than a single disease.|$|E

The motive that motivates pupils to participate is both internal and external factors, where the teachers emphasize that the internal factor is the goal.

40|$|On the marginality of lexical {{blending}} In {{spite of}} a recent surge of interest in it, blending remains among the most poorly understood and elusive word formation processes. What almost everybody seems to <b>be</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> although {{it appears to be}} attested in many languages, it is doubtlessly a marginal morphological process. However, a closer look at cross-linguistic data reveals <b>that</b> there <b>are</b> striking differences between individual lan-guages concerning the degree of its marginality. The goal we set ourselves in the present paper is to motivate the observed cross-linguistic differences by discuss-ing two clusters of factors that may {{play an important role in}} making blending more or less marginal, i. e. serve as functional prerequisites for the spread of blends. One of these are certain constructional traits of the languages involved. What we primarily have in mind here is the prominence of the constructional schemas for two other word formation processes – compounding and clipping. The other cluster of factors involved here has to do with the dynamics and flexi-bility in the lexicon, viz. the speed with which foreign lexemes are adapted and become near-native elements of the lexical stock. Our claim <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the less open and flexible a language is in this respect, the more marginal the blends <b>that</b> <b>are</b> found (if any) will tend to be. Key words: lexical blending, contrastive linguistics; motivation; constructional schema; conceptual integration; word formation; compounding; clipping; trunca-tion; lexical borrowing. 1...|$|R

The French colonial authorities only reported the Muslim version of events, which most scholars believe is responsible for inciting the pogrom.|$|E

40|$|You-all and yall {{may not be}} {{the most}} {{important}} features of Southern American English (SAE), but they are surely the two that have provoked the most discussion. Linguists have debated the origins of these forms (e. g., Boock 1933; Long 1943; Shewmake 1938; Smith 1920; Wilson 1960), their possible use as singulars (e. g., Richardson 1984; Tillery and Bailey 1998), and even their relationship to one an-other (Montgomery 1992). In fact, about the only thing that linguists writing on you-all and yall have <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these forms <b>are</b> largely restricted to SAE and related African American varieties. Our research over the past four years, however, suggests that even this one point of agreement may be open to question.

40|$|Children {{diagnosed}} with ADHD (attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder) is a continuously growing topic of discussion. The perception {{that most people}} today have <b>agreed</b> <b>on</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> ADHD may <b>be</b> a severe burden and a real handicap for many children and their families. What this means <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it requires several different operations, e. g.; health care, preschools, schools, social services and various types of treatment institutions <b>that</b> will <b>be</b> involved {{and they must be}} able to handle these individuals' difficulties. The reason why the problem of ADHD have become more prominent are the changes in today's society which comes into expression especially in the world of education and their working methods. ADHD is no longer just an individual and/or family problem. It affects the entire community and should be seen from a public health perspective. The aim of this work is to investigate parents' experiences of support and relief efforts focused on children {{diagnosed with}} ADHD. I want to examine how parents perceive the help/support in everyday life and school, which help resources/support actions <b>that</b> <b>are</b> perceived functioning as well as the less successful ones. Furthermore, the parents' own ideas about providing aid and support will be investigated. The results show that parents find it difficult to find the correct information about what support and assistance is available and also how to apply for these.

40|$|Stonehenge {{has always}} been veiled in mystery of ancient times past.

To be aligned with King Arthur, was an astute political move and was one practiced {{by all of the}} Tudors and the Stuarts. James I was particularly keen to be aligned with the legend and he had several family trees made which showed <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> a direct descendant from Arthur. Additionally in 1620, he sent his architect Inigo Jones to survey and examined Stonehenge. Jones’ work <b>on</b> Stonehenge <b>was</b> posthumously published by his assistant John Webb. Webb had edited it from a ‘few indigested notes’ that Jones had left. The book contained a reconstruction and an explanation of Stonehenge’s origins. For Jones, it was an early Roman temple. In 1720, William Stukeley carried out his own survey of Stonehenge and from this survey he also reconstructed it. He disagreed with Jones (but he blamed Webb), since for Stukeley it was a Druid temple. He did not publish his work for another twenty year by which time it had gained mystical elements, but the actual reconstruction over these twenty years did not change. In 1747, Bath architect John Wood the Elder published his reconstruction. He disagreed with both Jones’ and Stukeley’s reconstructions and although he agreed with Stukeley <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> a Druid temple he completely disagreed with his rationale and the architecture of his reconstruction.
