40|$|Engine {{performance}} {{improvement and}} exhaust emissions reduction {{are the two}} most important issues to develop a more efficient engine with less environmental impact. For a diesel engine, injection timing {{is one of the major}} parameters that affect the engine performance and emissions. Now-a-days, alternative fuels for internal combustion engines have created interest among the researchers around the world due to the limited reserve and rapid depletion of petroleum based fuels. In this paper, studies focused on characterizing influence of injection timing on engine performance and exhaust emissions have been critically reviewed where diesel, biodiesel, alcohol and other alternative fuels are used. In case of diesel fuel, advancement in injection timing results in lower carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emission; though it increases nitrogen oxides (NO x) emission. <b>Advance</b> <b>injection</b> timing increases brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and decreases brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC).

This paper presents a new correlation which has been developed during the research project on the direct injection M-type diesel engine using both the diesel and biodiesel fuel, as well as different values of a static injection timing. A dynamic start of injection, as well as the ignition delay, is defined in two ways.

40|$|Abstract. Concern {{over the}} {{environment}} and=or {{the increasing demand}} for conventional fossil fuel has promoted interest {{in the development of}} alternative sources of fuel energy for internal combustion (IC) engines. The effect of <b>advanced</b> <b>injection</b> timing on the performance of natural gas used as primary fuel in dual-fuel combustion has been examined. Satisfactory diesel engine combustion demands self-ignition of the fuel as it is injected near the top dead centre (TDC) into the hot swirling compressed cylinder gas. Longer delays between injection and ignition lead to unacceptable rates of pressure rise (diesel knock) because too much fuel is ready to burn when combustion eventually occurs. Natural gas has been noted to exhibit longer ignition delays and slower burning rates especially at low load levels hence resulting in late combustion in the expansion stroke. <b>Advanced</b> <b>injection</b> timing is expected to compensate for these effects. The engine has standard injection timing of 30 before TDC (BTDC). The <b>injection</b> was first <b>advanced</b> by 5 : 5 given injection timing of 35 : 5 BTDC.

40|$|<b>Advanced</b> <b>injection</b> {{devices such}} as auto-{{injector}}s and injector pens offer many benefits over con-ventional syringes, including ease of use, conven-ience and patient feedback, {{all of which can}} drive up compliance and improve clinical outcomes. However, a number of injection devices recently entering the market have suffered from product recalls, some of which can be attributed to use errors. This has prompted regulators to demand evidence that usability issues have been identified and addressed throughout the development process and a number of standards have been published recently to help device developers meet regulatory requirements and provide practical guidance. One of the primary standards is IEC 62366, which sets out a process to explore and validate usability throughout development. The US FDA now expects companies developing drug deliv-ery devices to follow these standards or at least demonstrate an equivalent approach. The emphasis of these standards is primarily related to addressing safety through elimina-tion of use errors that affect device safety, rather than focusing on other aspects of device design that might, for example, improve product appeal.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this program was to explore a combination of <b>advanced</b> <b>injection</b> control and urea-selective catalytic reduction (SCR) to reduce the emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) from a Tier 2 off-highway diesel engine to Tier 3 emission targets while maintaining fuel efficiency. The engine used in this investigation was a 2004 4. 5 L John Deere PowerTechTM; this engine was not equipped with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Under the original CRADA, the principal objective was to assess whether Tier 3 PM emission targets could be met solely by increasing the rail pressure. Although high rail pressure will lower the total PM emissions, it has a contrary effect to raise NOx emissions. To address this effect, a urea-SCR system {{was used to determine}} whether the enhanced NOx levels, associated with high rail pressure, could be reduced to Tier 3 levels. A key attraction for this approach is that it eliminates the need for a Diesel particulate filter (DPF) to remove PM emissions. The original CRADA effort was also performed using No. 2 Diesel fuel having a maximum sulfur level of 500 ppm. After a few years, the CRADA scope was expanded to include exploration of <b>advanced</b> <b>injection</b> strategies to improve catalyst regeneration and to explore the influence of urea-SCR on PM formation. During this period the emission targets also shifted to meeting more stringent Tier 4 emissions for NOx and PM, and the fuel type was changed to ultra-low sulfur Diesel (ULSD) having a maximum sulfur concentration of 15 ppm. New discoveries were made regarding PM formation at high rail pressures and the influences of oxidation catalysts and urea-SCR catalysts. These results are expected to provide a pathway for lower PM and NOx emissions for both off- and on-highway applications. Industrial in-kind support was available throughout the project period. Review of the research results were carried out on a regular basis (annual reports and meetings) followed by suggestions for improvement in ongoing work and direction for future work.
