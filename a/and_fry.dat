5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous year, 1893 was an unsuccessful one for Oxford. The university side failed to win a single match, and despite favourable batting conditions, none of the batsmen scored a century. Palairet was second in the batting averages, scoring 276 runs at 21.23. Bolton questioned the team selections that year under Palairet's captaincy, particularly for the University match, in which he believed a stronger team could have been chosen. Cambridge had a powerful team, containing eight of their players from the previous year, and adding Arthur Jones and K. S. Ranjitsinhji. Oxford lost the match by 266 runs, with only Palairet <b>and</b> <b>Fry</b> scoring more than 12 runs for the side.|$|E
5|$|On Omega 3 {{they find}} several {{original}} sets from Star Trek, {{and most of}} the original cast with their bodies and eternal youth. An energy being named Melllvar appears and explains that he became an obsessed Star Trek fan after watching the dumped tapes over and over again. Melllvar gives Nimoy a body, and orders the actors and the Planet Express crew to participate in a Star Trek convention until the end of time. Welshie is killed in a show of force to force their obedience. While Melllvar forces the cast to perform his fan script, Bender, Leela <b>and</b> <b>Fry</b> escape in the Planet Express Ship. Fry convinces the crew to attack Melllvar to save the actors, but Melllvar destroys the ship's engine as he drags it back to the planet.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} antecedent of {{the university}} was the engineering department of the Merchant Venturers' Technical College (founded as a school as early as 1595) which became the engineering faculty of Bristol University. The university was also preceded by Bristol Medical School (1833) and University College, Bristol, founded in 1876, where its first lecture was attended by only 99 students. The university was able {{to apply for a}} royal charter due to the financial support of the Wills <b>and</b> <b>Fry</b> families, who made their fortunes in tobacco plantations and chocolate, respectively. The Wills Family made a vast fortune from the tobacco industry and gave generously to the city and university. The royal charter was gained in May 1909, with 288 undergraduates and 400 other students entering the university in October 1909. Henry Overton Wills III became its first chancellor. The University College was the first such institution in the country to admit women on the same basis as men. However, women were forbidden to take examinations in medicine until 1906.|$|E

25|$|Qianzhang (skimmed {{soy bean}} cream) – Qianzhang is the cream skimmed from soybean milk. In order to create, this several steps must be {{followed}} very carefully. First, soybeans are soaked in water, ground, strained, boiled, restrained {{several times and}} spread over gauze until delicate, snow-white cream is formed. The paste can also be hardened, cut into slivers and seasoned with sesame oil, garlic and chili oil. Another variation is to bake the cream <b>and</b> <b>fry</b> it with bacon, which is described as soft and sweet.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of <b>frying</b> <b>and</b> roasting on nuts. <b>Frying</b> <b>and</b> roasting were performed according to the local Jordanian home-made cuisine, and the nuts under experiment were raw almonds, pine, cashew, and pistachio. Nuts samples were roasted at 110 °C for 16 minutes <b>and</b> <b>fried</b> at 175 °C for 2. 5 minutes. The results show that both roasting <b>and</b> <b>frying</b> of nuts {{did not affect the}} flavonoids content except for roasted pistachios where significant rise of flavonoids content was detected. Total phenolic content showed no significant differences except for pine nuts in which it increased significantly in both roasting <b>and</b> <b>frying.</b> Oxidative stability, presented by 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH), was significantly different in all nuts except for pistachio nuts that have shown no differences. Fatty acids profile, presented by saturated fatty acids (SFA), oleic acid (OL), and essential fatty acids (EFA), was affected significantly by roasting <b>and</b> <b>frying,</b> especially for SFA in almonds and pine nuts and α-linoleic acid (ALA) contents of pine. In conclusion, the effects of roasting <b>and</b> <b>frying</b> on the aforementioned nuts species were positive for fatty acids profile and antioxidants activity...|$|R

25|$|Most filter-feeding {{pelagic fish}} found in coastal waters are small, silvery forage fish. Forage fish include fishes {{of the family}} Clupeidae (herrings, shad, {{sardines}} and pilchards, hilsa, menhaden and sprats), as well as anchovies, capelin and halfbeaks. They use schooling strategies to avoid predators, and different schools of forage fish often associate {{with each other in}} open coastal waters. Forage fish feed near the base of the food chain on plankton <b>and</b> <b>fry</b> (recently hatched fish), often by filter feeding. In turn, they are preyed on by larger predatory fish, seabirds and marine mammals.|$|E
25|$|Young forage fish, such as herring, mostly feed on {{phytoplankton}} {{and as they}} mature {{they start}} to consume larger organisms. Older herrings feed on zooplankton, tiny animals that are found in oceanic surface waters, and fish larvae <b>and</b> <b>fry</b> (recently hatched fish). Copepods and other tiny crustaceans are common zooplankton eaten by forage fish. During daylight, many forage fish stay {{in the safety of}} deep water, feeding at the surface only at night when there is less chance of predation. They swim with their mouths open, filtering plankton from the water as it passes through their gills.|$|E
25|$|The Army of Republika Srpska {{was created}} on 12 May 1992. Before the VRS was {{formally}} created, {{there were a}} number of paramilitary groups such as the Srpska Dobrovoljačka Garda, Beli Orlovi, as well as some Russian, Greek and other volunteers. The army was equipped with ex-JNA inventory. It had about 200 tanks, mostly T-55s and 85 M-84s, and 150 APCs with several heavy artillery pieces. The Air Defense of VRS has shot down several aircraft, like F-16, Mirage 2000, F-18 and one Croatian Air Force MiG-21. The VRS received support from the Yugoslav Army <b>and</b> <b>FRY.</b>|$|E

50|$|Food is {{prepared}} in traditional Tatar cuisine mainly by boiling, <b>frying,</b> <b>and</b> baking. <b>Frying</b> is primarily used for dough-based foods, much less for meats, which are typically boiled (except meat for pilaw, which requires quick <b>frying).</b> Both boiling <b>and</b> <b>frying</b> were traditionally {{done in a}} cast-iron cauldron built {{into the side of}} the large kitchen stove. Baking was done in an oven. Cooking over an open fire was not common. This method was used for making pancakes (täçe qoymaq) <b>and</b> <b>fried</b> eggs (täbä).|$|R

25|$|Puerto Rican {{immigration}} to Hawaii began in 1900, contributing spicy, Spanish-seasoned thick soups, casseroles, pasteles, and meat turnovers. Filipinos reached Hawaii in 1909, bringing peas and beans, the adobo style of vinegar and garlic dishes, choosing to boil, stew, broil, <b>and</b> <b>fry</b> food instead of baking, and eating sweet potatoes as a staple instead of rice. Samoans arrived in 1919, building their earth ovens above ground instead of below like the imu, and made poi from fruit instead of taro. After the Vietnam War ended in 1975 immigrants from Southeast Asia arrived, bringing lemongrass, fish sauce and galangal popular in Thai and Vietnamese cuisine.|$|E
25|$|At the hive, Leela paints Bender like a bee {{to deceive}} the real bees while she <b>and</b> <b>Fry</b> collect the honey. The crew {{discover}} {{the remains of}} the previous Planet Express crew and ship, but Leela insists that they press on. After gathering the honey, Leela decides to bring home a baby queen bee. On the way out, Bender inadvertently insults the hive's queen, causing the bees to attack. The crew escape, but in the ship, the baby queen awakens and attacks Leela. Fry throws himself in front of Leela to protect her, and is impaled by the bee's stinger while Leela is only pricked by the tip. Bender disposes of the bee and Leela awakens with a minor wound, but sees Fry lying dead on the floor.|$|E
25|$|In 1980–81, {{his final}} year at university, besides rowing, Laurie was {{president}} of the Footlights, with Thompson as vice-president. They took their annual revue, The Cellar Tapes, to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and won the first Perrier Comedy Award. The revue was written principally by Laurie <b>and</b> <b>Fry,</b> and the cast also included Thompson, Tony Slattery, Paul Shearer and Penny Dwyer. He states that he did not graduate from Cambridge. The Perrier Award led to a West End transfer for The Cellar Tapes and a television version of the revue, broadcast in May 1982. It resulted in Laurie, Fry and Thompson being selected, along with Ben Elton, Robbie Coltrane and Siobhan Redmond to write and appear in a new sketch comedy show for Granada Television, Alfresco, which ran for two series.|$|E

25|$|The second {{trophic level}} (primary consumers) is {{occupied}} by zooplankton which feed off the phytoplankton. Together with the phytoplankton, they form {{the base of the}} food pyramid that supports most of the world's great fishing grounds. Zooplankton are tiny animals found with the phytoplankton in oceanic surface waters, and include tiny crustaceans, and fish larvae <b>and</b> <b>fry</b> (recently hatched fish). Most zooplankton are filter feeders, and they use appendages to strain the phytoplankton in the water. Some larger zooplankton also feed on smaller zooplankton. Some zooplankton can jump about a bit to avoid predators, but they can't really swim. Like phytoplankton, they float with the currents, tides and winds instead. Zooplanktons can reproduce rapidly, their populations can increase up to thirty percent a day under favourable conditions. Many live short and productive lives and reach maturity quickly.|$|E
25|$|Peter Singer, in Democracy and Disobedience, {{argues that}} {{compulsory}} voting could negate {{the obligation of}} a voter to support {{the outcome of the}} election, since voluntary participation in elections is deemed {{to be one of the}} sources of the obligation to obey the law in a democracy. In 1996 Albert Langer was jailed for three weeks on contempt charges in relation to a constitutional challenge on a legal way not to vote for either of the major parties. Chong, Davidson <b>and</b> <b>Fry,</b> writing in the journal of the right wing think tank the CIS, argue that Australian compulsory voting is disreputable, paternalistic, disadvantages smaller political parties, and allows major parties to target marginal seats and make some savings in pork-barrelling because of this targeting. Chong et al. also argue that denial is a significant aspect of the debate about compulsory voting.|$|E
25|$|Rowntree had {{struggled}} to make a milk chocolate product of comparable quality or value to Cadbury's Dairy Milk. Joseph Rowntree even described the growing market for milk chocolate as a fad. Rowntree's poor performance in the category became a major problem from 1914 onwards, as British public preference continued to move towards milk chocolate, {{and away from the}} more bitter cocoa essence products. Rowntree's two major rivals, Cadbury <b>and</b> <b>Fry,</b> merged in 1918, and although Rowntree was invited to partake in the merger, the company declined to do so. Meanwhile, the Rowntree board was torn as to whether it should become a low-turnover, high-quality product company or a mass producer of cheaper lines. Seebohm Rowntree inherited a struggling company when he succeeded his father as chairman in 1923. By 1930, as a result of all its problems, Rowntree was approaching bankruptcy.|$|E
