The theoretical part of the diploma thesis focuses on problems of Integrated Rescue System, shows its units cooperated during the actions with the necessity of {{the entrance to the}} closed areas and specifies legislation focused to this type of incidents. It names the ways of entrance to the closed areas according to possible fire-fighting accesses, <b>admission</b> <b>port</b> to the objects and their technical provision in case of defalt in rescue of people. The main part of the diploma thesis in theoretical part is shot to the specification of fire-fighting technics, technical and material means, used for emergency entrance to the closed areas at Fire Rescue Service Moravian-Silesian Region, Regional Fire Rescue Service Karviná. At the conclusion of the theoretical part there are the most important aspects of tactics of Fire Rescue Service forces in actions described, where they are obliged to open closed obstructions for the entrance and to enter the closed areas regarding to solve technical help, fires or rescue of people. Because Police of the Czech Republic is the component of the Integrated Rescue System it takes part in most cases of Fire Rescue Service´s actions. That is the reason why I introduced the tactics in the actions of Fire Rescue Service force relating to the Fire Protection, very interesting methods of entrance to the closed areas used by special Police force. In the practical part of the diploma thesis there are methods and ways of emergency entrance to the closed areas using modern methods and technical support. To explain described methods of entrance and making obstructions up, I used the experiences obtained during my professional Fire Rescue Service. After the analysis of the separate methods there is an evaluation of their implementation and risks or complications during the actions. All methods and ways of emergency entrance are illustrated by photos. Then there is a summary of events from 2007 to 2012 when I was included to Regional Fire Rescue Service in Karviná. This summary shows frequency of actions in entrance to the closed areas in Moravian-Silesian Region in 2012. Next there is an analysis of means of Regional Fire Rescue Service in Karviná, used for opening and entrance to the closed areas. The effect of the analysis is to detect facilities for effective implementation of actions. On the basis of results the optimalisation was suggested to guarantee preparedness for these actions. In conclusion a ?door and window opener? is designed, including the verification of functionality. The technical documentation and direction for use are in enclosures. In conclusion of the practical part of the diploma thesis there is a discussion and evaluation of all aims of the work as practical processes of emergency entrance of Fire Rescue Service (FRS) forces to closed areas, evaluation of different types of rescuing people, FRS data processing and designing of the ?door and window opener?. At the end of the discussion the exploratory question was confirmed which evaluated facilities of FRS for emergency entrance to the closed areas, their insufficiency or necesity of inovation and, of course, if the door and window opener suggested in this work will improve the entrance to the closed areas and the action standard...|$|E

50|$|So {{that the}} entire {{locomotive}} cylinder block {{does not have to}} be changed when the valves are damaged, they are housed in special chests. The valve chest consists of two elements which are forced into the cylinder block from the front and rear. Using special boring tools this chest can be bored out several times during maintenance. In the last illustration the junction of the two halves of the chest and the right-angled ports can be seen towards the rear. These are steam <b>admission</b> <b>ports.</b> Steam is admitted to the pistons of the steam engine through the front diagonal slits. The front area, outside the valve chest, is called the exhaust chest and discharges, via the exhaust pipe, the riser (Standrohr) and the blast pipe cap (Blasrohrkopf) centrally, underneath the chimney of the locomotive. The motion of the valve heads alternately opens and closes the diagonal slits or steam ports, thus controlling the admission and exhausting of steam in the steam engine.|$|R

For more {{information}} on how to obtain this article please visit the ASME Digital Library, [URL]. The paper focusses attention on alternative approaches for treating the coupling between the flow in the annulus supply ducts and the jets which enter combustor primary and dilution zones through air <b>admission</b> <b>ports.</b> Traditionally CFD predictions of combustor flows have modeled this in a very weakly coupled manner, with the port flow conditions being derived from 1 D empirical correlations and used as boundary conditions for an internal-flow-only combustor CFD prediction. Recent work by the authors and others has introduced the viewpoint that fully coupled external-annulus–internal-combustor predictions is the way forward. Experimental data is gathered in the present work to quantify the strength of the interaction between annulus and core flows, which ultimately determines the jet characteristics at port exit. These data are then used to illustrate the improvement in the prediction of port exit jet characteristics which is obtained by adopting fully coupled calculations compared to the internal-flow-only approach. As a final demonstration of the importance of a fully coupled approach, isothermal calculations are presented for a single sector generic annular combustor. These show that quite different primary zone flow patterns are obtained from the two approaches, leading to considerable differences in the overall mixing pattern at combustor exit...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Competitive pressure and stringent emissions legislation have placed an urgent demand on research to improve {{our understanding of the}} gas turbine combustor flow field. Flow through the air <b>admission</b> <b>ports</b> of a combustor plays an essential role in determining the internal flow patterns on which many features of combustor performance depend. This thesis explains how a combination of experimental and computational research has helped improve our understanding, and ability to predict, the flow characteristics of jets entering a combustor. The experiments focused on a simplified generic geometry of a combustor port system. Two concentric tubes, with ports introduced into the inner tube's wall, allowed a set of radially impinging jets to be formed within the inner tube. By investigating the flow with LDA instrumentation and flow visualisation methods a quantitative and qualitative picture of the mean and turbulent flow fields has been constructed. Data were collected from the annulus, port and core regions. These data provide suitable validation information for computational models, allow improved understanding of the detailed flow physics and provide the global performance parameters used traditionally by combustor designers. Computational work focused on improving the port representation within CFD models. This work looked at the effect of increasing the grid refinement, and improving the geometrical representation of the port. The desire to model realistic port features {{led to the development of}} a stand-alone port modelling module. Comparing calculations of plain-circular ports to those for more realistic chuted port geometry, for example, showed that isothermal modelling methods were able to predict the expected changes to the global parameters measured. Moreover, these effects are seen to have significant consequences on the predicted combustor core flow field...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Lancefield group B streptococci(GBS) {{are common}} causes of {{infection}} in adult with diabetes {{as well as}} a classical cause of perinatal meningitis. The organism is a classical beta-hemolytic streptococcus. We present an unusual cause of human infection due to GBS, a chemotherapy port site with bacteremia with an organism without hemolysis (so-called gamma hemolysis), a rare phenotypic manifestation of GBS. Case Report: A 63 year old male was admitted for fever, chills and altered mental status. He had been recently diagnosed with pancreatic carcinoma and had had a stent placed in his common bile duct. One week before <b>admission,</b> a chemotherapy <b>port</b> was placed and on admission had no local signs and symptoms of infection and had not started chemotherapy. He was febrile, his WBC was 15 K and he had no clear focal findings on physical examination and chest and abdominal imaging. 2 blood cultures were positive for Gram positive cocci in pairs and chains which revealed a gamma (or non-) hemolytic streptococcus that was subsequently identified as a Group B streptococcus. In the absence of another source, the port was explanted and the patient recovered without further positive cultures. Conclusion: We present an unusual case of GBS infection causing a infusion port infection with an organism that was nonhemolytic. Nonhemolytic GBS represent only 1 - 3 % of GBS and are generally are caused by mutations in a transporter that normally exports the hemolysin extracellularly. The mutation is also associated with the lack of GBS orange/red pigment production. These nonhemolytic GBS isolates are generally considered to be less virulent but not nonpathogenic. It {{is important to remember that}} nonhemolytic streptococci can be pathogenic and may be part of GBS that are usually beta-hemolytic...|$|R
