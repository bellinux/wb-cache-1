50|$|A {{theme of}} Wiedermann's allergy {{research}} has been the treatment of allergies via mucosal tolerance induction with recombinant allergens, probiotics or other microbes. For a key 2001 paper in the International Archives of Allergy and Immunology Wiedermann used recombinant fragments of the birch pollen allergen Bet v I to induce mucosal tolerance in a mouse model of birch pollen allergy. In 2008 the Wiedermann lab challenged the 'microflora hypothesis', which holds that altered microflora contributed to allergies, by showing that Bet v 1 could induce mucosal tolerance in mice regardless of {{the presence or absence}} of microflora. In 2009 the Wiedermann lab provided some supporting evidence for the hygiene hypothesis of allergies by showing that infection with the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii could prevent allergic immune responses in birch pollen allergic mice. In 2011 the Wiedermann lab showed in mice that probiotics could have <b>anti-allergic</b> effects against multiple allergens. In 2012 the Wiedermann lab showed that a fusion protein containing several allergens could treat birch pollen-related food allergy, in which patients are allergic to homologues of Bet v I.

50|$|Flavonoids are {{one class}} of {{secondary}} plant metabolites {{that are also}} known as Vitamin P or citrin. These metabolites are mostly used in plants to produce yellow and other pigments which play {{a big role in}} coloring the plants. In addition, Flavonoids are readily ingested by humans and they seem to display important anti-inflammatory, <b>anti-allergic</b> and anti-cancer activities. Flavonoids are also found to be powerful anti-oxidants and researchers are looking into their ability to prevent cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Flavonoids help prevent cancer by inducing certain mechanisms that may help to kill cancer cells, and researches believe that when the body processes extra flavonoid compounds, it triggers specific enzymes that fight carcinogens. Good dietary sources of Flavonoids are all citrus fruits, which contain the specific flavanoids hesperidins, quercitrin,and rutin, berries, tea, dark chocolate and red wine and many of the health benefits attributed to these foods come from the Flavonoids they contain. Flavonoids are synthesized by the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway where the amino acid phenylalanine is used to produce 4-coumaryol-CoA, and this is then combined with malonyl-CoA to produce chalcones which are backbones of Flavonoids Chalcones are aromatic ketones with two phenyl rings that are important in many biological compounds. The closure of chalcones causes the formation of the flavonoid structure. Flavonoids are also closely related to flavones which are actually a sub class of flavonoids, and are the yellow pigments in plants. In addition to flavones, 11 other subclasses of Flavonoids including, isoflavones, flavans, flavanones, flavanols, flavanolols, anthocyanidins, catechins (including proanthocyanidins), leukoanthocyanidins, dihydrochalcones, and aurones.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies showed}} that heparin's <b>anti-allergic</b> {{activity}} is molecular weight dependent and resides in oligosaccharide fractions of Objective To investigate the structural sequence of heparin's <b>anti-allergic</b> domain, we used nitrous acid depolymerization of porcine heparin to prepare an oligosaccharide, and then fractionated it into disaccharide, tetrasaccharide, hexasaccharide, and octasaccharide fractions. The <b>anti-allergic</b> activity of each oligosaccharide fraction was tested in allergic sheep. Methods Allergic sheep without (acute responder) and with late airway responses (LAR; dual responder) were challenged with Ascaris suum antigen with and without inhaled oligosaccharide pretreatment and the effects on specific lung resistance and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to carbachol determined. Additional inflammatory cell recruitment studies were performed in immunized ovalbumin-challenged BALB/C mice with and without treatment. Results The inhaled tetrasaccharide fraction was the minimal effective chain length to show <b>anti-allergic</b> activity. This fraction showed activity in both groups of sheep; it was also effective in inhibiting LAR and AHR, when administered after the antigen challenge. Tetrasaccharide failed to modify the bronchoconstrictor responses to airway smooth muscle agonists (histamine, carbachol and LTD 4), and {{had no effect on}} antigen-induced histamine release in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in sheep. In mice, inhaled tetrasaccharide also attenuated the ovalbumin-induced peribronchial inflammatory response and eosinophil influx in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Chemical analysis identified the active structure to be a pentasulfated tetrasaccharide ([IdoU 2 S (1 → 4) GlcNS 6 S (1 → 4) IdoU 2 S (1 → 4) AMan- 6 S]) which lacked anti-coagulant activity. Conclusions These results demonstrate that heparin tetrasaccharide possesses potent <b>anti-allergic</b> and anti-inflammatory properties, and that the domains responsible for <b>anti-allergic</b> and anti-coagulant activity are distinctly different. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} the <b>anti-allergic</b> drugs, sodium {{cromoglycate}} (SCG), lodoxamide, traxanox, RU 31156 and the beta-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol to inhibit IgE-dependent histamine and prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2) release was assessed using human dispersed lung mast cells. The <b>anti-allergic</b> drugs were weak inhibitors of histamine release, high concentrations (100 - 1000 microM) producing less than 35 % inhibition. Salbutamol produced 39 % inhibition at 10 microM. The efficacy of both SCG and salbutamol was inversely related to the concentration of anti-IgE used for challenge and {{to the degree of}} histamine release. Rapid tachyphylaxis was observed with all <b>anti-allergic</b> drugs but not with salbutamol. Cross-tachyphylaxis was observed between SCG and the other <b>anti-allergic</b> drugs, suggesting a common mechanism of action. No cross-tachyphylaxis was observed between SCG and salbutamol. SCG was significantly (P less than 0. 001) more effective in inhibiting PGD 2 than it was histamine release. Preferential inhibition of PGD 2 compared with histamine release was less marked (P less than 0. 05) with salbutamol and not significant with the other <b>anti-allergic</b> drugs. Mast cells dispersed by enzymatic digestion of human lung released more histamine on immunological challenge than mechanically dispersed cells obtained by fine chopping of tissue. Enzyme treatment of mechanically dispersed cells removed this difference. Enzymatically and mechanically dispersed cells responded similarly to the inhibitory effects of SCG and salbutamol. Our results suggest that salbutamol is a more effective inhibitor of mediator release from human lung mast cells than <b>anti-allergic</b> drugs. However, with the low levels of mediator release achieved during an allergic reaction in man in vivo, both salbutamol and SCG are likely to be effective inhibitors of both preformed and newly generated mediators...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Treatment with topical eye drops for long-standing ocular {{diseases}} like allergy can induce detrimental side effects. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate in vitro cytotoxicity of commercially preserved and unpreserved <b>anti-allergic</b> eye drops on the viability and barrier function of monolayer and stratified human corneal-limbal epithelial cells. Methods: Cells were treated with unpreserved ketotifen solution, benzalkonium chloride (BAC) -containing <b>anti-allergic</b> drugs (ketotifen, olopatadine, levocabastine) as well as BAC alone. 3 -(4, 5 -Dimethyl- 2 -thiazolyl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl- 2 H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to determine cell viability. Effects of compounds on barrier function were analyzed measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) to determine paracellular permeability and rose bengal assays to evaluate transcellular barrier formation. Results: The BAC-preserved <b>anti-allergic</b> formulations and BAC alone significantly reduced cell viability, monolayer cultures being more sensitive to damage by these solutions. Unpreserved ketotifen induced the least diminution in cell viability. The extent of decrease of cell viability was clearly dependent of BAC presence, but it was also affected by the different types of drugs when the concentration of BAC was low and the short time of exposure. Treatment with BAC-containing <b>anti-allergic</b> drugs and BAC alone resulted in increased paracellular permeability and loss of transcellular barrier function as indicated by TEER measurement and rose bengal assays. Conclusions: The presence of the preservative BAC in <b>anti-allergic</b> eye drop formulations contributes importantly to the cytotoxic effects induced by these compounds. Stratified cell cultures seem to be a more relevant model for toxicity evaluation induced on the ocular surface epithelia than monolayer cultures...|$|E
40|$|In {{pharmacotherapy}} for bronchitis and asthma, anti-hista-mines and <b>anti-allergic</b> {{drugs can}} be used concomitantly with theophylline (TP) to avoid induction of bronchoconstriction and inflammation in the respiratory tract.
