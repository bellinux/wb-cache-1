25|$|The {{post office}} was a {{different}} situation.

The men responded to the first round of tear gas by smashing the windows for ventilation and arming themselves with whatever projectiles they could find. The RCMP entered the building and forcibly ejected the men, who were subjected to a cordon of police armed with batons upon leaving the building. City police outside assisted the Mounties.

500|$|The leafless, spiny stem is the {{characteristic}} {{feature of the}} majority of cacti (<b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> belonging to the largest subfamily, the Cactoideae). The stem is typically succulent, meaning it is adapted to store water. The surface of the stem may be smooth (as in some species of Opuntia) or covered with protuberances of various kinds, which are usually called tubercles. These vary from small [...] "bumps" [...] to prominent, nipple-like shapes in the genus Mammillaria and outgrowths almost like leaves in Ariocarpus species. The stem may also be ribbed or fluted in shape. The prominence of these ribs depends on how much water the stem is storing: when full (up to 90% of the mass of a cactus may be water), the ribs may be almost invisible on the swollen stem, whereas when the cactus is short of water and the stems shrink, the ribs may be very visible.|$|E
500|$|Papa {{was born}} on March 10, 1987 to Kwaku and Gertrude Oppong and {{was brought up in}} the Pickering, Ontario area. Both of his parents were natives of Ghana in West Africa, and Papa began playing soccer. He could not skate, meaning he {{struggled}} with ice hockey, Canada's most popular sport. Oppong said, [...] "Soccer is really popular in Africa, so my dad got me into soccer. Basketball is more of my love. I was sitting down and watching Michael Jordan and Kobe <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> guys when I was younger, and I had more of a passion for it."

500|$|Other songs {{allude to}} darker themes {{of fear and}} {{personal}} insecurities.

Caitlin White of The 405 believed the songs as [...] "hold forth on the most important issues in a woman's life by delving into [...] personal experience with them". [...] "Jealous" [...] addresses fidelity and features lyrics in which the protagonist experiences [...] "promises, suspicion and potential revenge". It contains an [...] "uncanny mix of tones and styles", most prominently a morose bassline replete with electronic yelps. [...] "Mine", a futuristic R song with jazz elements, is self-reflective, with lyrics that reference marital strife and difficulties with postnatal depression. The neo soul song [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] is a self-empowerment anthem that decries society's obsession with harmful and unattainable standards of beauty. The song uses audio snippets of beauty pageants which Beyoncé contested in to frame the song in the context of her childhood.|$|E

500|$|The bill {{became an}} Act of Parliament on 1 April 1772, authorising the {{construction}} of a canal to run [...] "from the River Dee, within the liberties of the city of Chester, to or near Middlewich and Nantwich". The Act allowed the company to raise £42,000 by issuing £100 shares, and an additional £20,000 if necessary. Of this, only £28,000 had been subscribed {{at the time of the}} Act, but construction began near Chester, with Samual Weston acting as engineer and John Lawton working as his assistant. Weston had previously worked as a surveyor, and had been involved in excavating canals as a contractor, but had no experience of managing a major engineering project. The Mayor of Chester cut the first sod at the end of April. There were concerns that while the canal was being constructed past Northgate Gardens, prisoners from Northgate Prison might escape, and the company had to give a bond against this possibility. The canal was conceived as a broad canal, designed with locks which were [...] by [...] suitable for broad-beam barges. Most of the Trent and Mersey Canal north of the proposed junction was suitable for barges which were [...] wide, but the final three locks in Middlewich, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> south of the junction, are only suitable for [...] narrow-beam barges.|$|E
