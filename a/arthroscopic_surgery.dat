5|$|On December 3, Harris {{underwent}} <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgery</b> {{to repair}} a torn lateral meniscus in her left knee. The injury had affected her play since June and kept her out for a month following the surgery.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{signed with}} the Phillies in 2000 but did not pitch due to {{discomfort}} in his right shoulder the first time Jackson warmed up to pitch in a game for Philadelphia. On May 26, Jackson had season-ending <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgery</b> to repair a SLAP tear in his right shoulder.|$|E
5|$|During {{the preseason}} in 2002, Alford injured {{his knee and}} {{required}} <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgery.</b> Prior to returning to the lineup, Alford {{was released from the}} team due to new head coach Gary Etcheverry's desire to focus on the running game. He briefly joined the practice squad of the Ottawa Renegades, but later re-signed with the Argonauts to their own practice squad.|$|E
30|$|Despite great {{advances}} in arthroscopy, many <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgeries</b> {{have now been}} replaced by arthrocentesis. We propose a simple diagnostic and therapeutic method having operative rigid ultra-thin arthroscopy with 16 gauge needle size combined with arthrocentesis.|$|R
30|$|Despite several {{case reports}} of HO after <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgeries</b> in {{different}} joints [14 – 17], HO development after hip arthroscopy {{has not been}} deeply investigated so far. Only one recent study reported HO {{as one of the}} possible complications following hip arthroscopy [18].|$|R
50|$|During the 1980 and 1983 playoffs, Morrow had <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgeries</b> {{performed}} to his knees, and played only days afterward {{in order to}} contribute to the Islanders championships, often having fluid drained from his knees between games. He was eventually forced to retire prematurely from the game in 1988-89 due to constant knee problems.|$|R
5|$|After {{starting}} {{the season with}} a 4–2 record, Young lost his last four starts before spending the remainder of the season on the disabled list. His final start occurred on June 14. He was initially placed on the 15-day disabled list on June 19, but on July 31 he was transferred to the 60-day disabled list. In August, he had season ending <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgery</b> to repair partial tears in his labrum. He had been disabled with shoulder inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Early in the season, Bure {{sustained}} {{the first of}} several serious knee injuries during his career. On November 9, 1995, in a game against the Chicago Blackhawks, Bure was grabbed around the head by defenceman Steve Smith while approaching the end boards. Falling to the ice, he caught his skate against the boards, tearing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his right knee. Requiring <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgery,</b> in which tendon was removed from his hamstring to repair the ACL, he was sidelined {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|In Week 3 of the 2005 season, both Pennington and {{backup quarterback}} Jay Fiedler were injured against the Jaguars. With both quarterbacks {{out for the}} season, third-string quarterback Brooks Bollinger started; the 41-year-old Testaverde was brought out of {{retirement}} to serve as his backup. Bollinger played badly in a loss in week four, and Testaverde became the starter. Testaverde had little success, and Bollinger did not fare better when he was re-inserted. Running back Curtis Martin chose to have <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgery</b> on his knee with four games left in the season. The Jets finished 4–12.|$|E
50|$|Hefferon {{is known}} for total joint {{replacement}} of the knee and shoulder, as well as orthopedic sports medicine. He also performs ACL <b>surgery,</b> shoulder replacement, <b>arthroscopic</b> repair <b>surgery,</b> <b>arthroscopic</b> rotator cuff repair <b>surgery,</b> and <b>arthroscopic</b> labrum tear repair surgery.|$|R
40|$|Knee {{infection}} after <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgeries</b> is rare but devastating complication. A serial {{knee joint}} infection occurred in our hospital after the contamination of arthroscopic equipments set with an unknown microorganism.

50|$|In {{the spring}} {{prior to his}} 2010 season, Johnson had <b>arthroscopic</b> {{shoulder}} <b>surgery.</b>|$|R
5|$|Luck {{distributed}} his passes relatively evenly {{among his}} receivers. Doug Baldwin was the team's leading receiver, with 56 receptions for 824 yards and 9 touchdowns {{during the regular}} season. Wide receiver and kick returner Chris Owusu, who played in only six games because of a knee injury, underwent <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgery</b> and was expected {{to play in the}} Orange Bowl. He was the team's fourth-leading receiver in terms of yardage, catching 24 passes for 394 yards and 3 touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|On January 17, 2011, Roy {{underwent}} <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgery</b> {{on both of}} his knees. He {{returned to}} the lineup on February 25, scoring 18 points off the bench, including a clutch three-pointer to force overtime, and helping the Blazers win the game 107–106. Roy then took on a reserve role {{for the rest of}} the season, scoring inconsistently to finish with a career-low season average of 12.2 points, 2.6 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 28 minutes in 47 games.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Öhlund began {{experiencing}} inflammation in his right knee. The Lightning placed him on injured reserve on October 4, 2011; a week later, he underwent <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgery</b> on both knees. After there was optimism he was close to returning to the lineup in December, he suffered a setback with his left knee and underwent further surgery in February 2012. During his recovery, he told reporters with Swedish newspaper Expressen that he was unsure whether he could continue playing.|$|E

5|$|Following Houston's loss to Utah, McGrady {{underwent}} <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgery</b> on {{both his}} left shoulder and left knee. Early in the 2008–09 season, he missed 18 games, including a two-week stretch in January as his knee was not fully healed from his offseason surgery. On February 24, he had microfracture surgery in Chicago, forcing him to miss {{the remainder of the}} year. By then, his averages had declined to 15.6 points and 4.4 rebounds per game. In a surprise turn of events, the Rockets qualified for the playoffs without McGrady and advanced to the second round, pushing the eventual-champion Los Angeles Lakers to seven games.|$|E
5|$|He re-invented the {{practice}} of stiff-arming his tacklers, which {{had gone out of}} favor among running backs in the 1970s. At times, he used his high school experience as a long jumper to leap over his opponents, landing on his head in the end zone to gain a touchdown in a game against the Buffalo Bills. His running gait was somewhat unusual, as his knees were minimally bent, and the motion was largely powered from the hip. This may have given his knees, a football player's most vulnerable joints, some protection, although he underwent <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgery</b> on both knees in 1983. He referred to this procedure as an 11,000-yard checkup.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell {{worked out}} for the Kansas City Chiefs on June 6, 2005, {{following}} his release from the Eagles. He signed with the Chiefs on June 17 after Az-Zahir Hakim decided against signing with the team. Mitchell did not receive a signing bonus. He began practicing with the team {{on the last day}} of mini-camps, June 18, and received extra practice with the coaches the following week. He suffered a knee injury during practice on July 30 and was scheduled to undergo <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgery</b> the following week, but declined to go through with it. He was released on September 2 due to concerns about his knee. Mitchell elected to have knee surgery on September 6 following his release.|$|E
50|$|Like {{many of the}} team's {{offensive}} linemen, James struggled some in 2005. Inconsistency {{and poor}} play at the left tackle and center positions that surround James did not help either. James started at left guard the first nine games this season, but was inactive the next five games while recovering from two subsequent <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgeries</b> on his right knee. James was placed on Injured Reserve on December 19, ending his season.|$|R

5|$|After a short {{stint in}} the minors in 2000, Nathan {{spent most of the}} season in the majors, {{finishing}} 5–2 and even hitting two home runs. But he struggled with his control, walking 63 in 93 innings and ending the season with a 5.21 ERA. He was on the disabled list twice: from May 17 to June 6 for right shoulder tendinitis and from July 14 to August 18 for an inflamed right shoulder, necessitating <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgery</b> on the afflicted shoulder {{at the end of the}} season. Nathan divided 2001 between the AAA Fresno Grizzlies and AA Shreveport both starting and relieving, finishing with a disappointing combined 3–11 record and an ERA over 7. Nathan improved slightly in 2002 to 6–12 with an ERA of over 5 at Fresno, but finally overcame his postsurgical struggles to return to the Giants in September with 3 scoreless innings in relief.|$|E
5|$|Bertuzzi scored {{his first}} goal with the Flames, {{deflecting}} a Dion Phaneuf shot, on October 12, 2008, in a 5-4 overtime {{loss to the}} Vancouver Canucks. While initial fan reaction to Bertuzzi was negative due to his previous role with the division-rival Canucks, {{as well as his}} reputation following the Steve Moore incident, he was eventually accepted in Calgary. In January 2009, he missed five games due to a back injury. Several months later, he was sidelined again with a knee injury and underwent <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgery</b> to repair damaged cartilage on March 3, 2009. Missing 11 games, he returned in time for the 2009 playoffs, where the Flames were eliminated by the Chicago Blackhawks in the opening round. He finished his only season in Calgary with 44 points in 66 regular season games, while adding a goal and an assist in six playoff contests.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{started his}} {{season in the}} Brisbane International as the {{defending}} champion, despite having a virus when the tournament started. However, in a rematch of the previous year's final, he lost in the final to Milos Raonic in straight sets. Federer then participated at the 2016 Australian Open and rebounded from his third round defeat by Andreas Seppi in 2015 by reaching the semifinals but lost to eventual champion Novak Djokovic in four sets. The day after his loss to Djokovic, Federer sustained a knee injury and in early February, he underwent <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgery</b> to repair a torn meniscus in his knee and missed the tournaments in Rotterdam, Dubai and Indian Wells in February and March. He was scheduled to return to action in Miami. Due to a stomach virus he had to withdraw from Miami thus prolonging his time on the sidelines.|$|E

5|$|Nevin {{suffered}} a dislocated shoulder {{in spring training}} in 2003 while making a diving catch. He had surgery on his left shoulder {{and returned to the}} Padres in June. The Padres acquired Rondell White to replace Nevin, and White went on to have an All-Star season in left field. Ryan Klesko filled in at first base and rookie Sean Burroughs played well at third base, Nevin's favorite position. Nevin offered to be used in a utility role, alternating with White, Klesko, and Burroughs, as well as Xavier Nady in right field. In 2004, Nevin had more than 100 RBI {{for the third time in}} his career, but underwent <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgery</b> to repair torn cartilage in his right knee in July.|$|E
5|$|During {{the regular}} season, the Hokies {{averaged}} 29.3 {{points per game}} and scored at least 21 points in 22 consecutive games—a streak dating to the 1995 season. Virginia Tech's offense was led on the field by quarterback Al Clark, who passed for 1,476 yards and 10 touchdowns. He also ran for 344 yards during the regular season. At the beginning of December, however, Clark underwent <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgery</b> on his left knee in order to repair damaged cartilage in the joint. Due to the long recovery time involved with the surgery, it was questioned if he would play in the Gator Bowl or {{if he would be}} able to play at full strength. Four days prior to the game, Clark's presence at the game was put even more in doubt when he caught the flu and developed a 102-degree fever. Clark's backup, redshirt freshman quarterback Nick Sorensen, completed 11 of his 21 pass attempts during the season for 140 yards and two touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Rivera rebounded in 2008 {{and began}} the year with 16consecutive {{scoreless}} innings pitched and 28consecutive save opportunities converted, both personal bests to start a season. His first-half performance, highlighted by a 1.06ERA and 23saves in as many opportunities, garnered him his ninth All-Star selection. Leading up to the 2008 MLB All-Star Game, which was held at Yankee Stadium in the venue's final year of existence, a few sportswriters proposed making Rivera the AL's starting pitcher {{as a tribute to}} him and his home ballpark. He instead was used as a reliever in the AL's extra-inning win. In the final month of the season, he recorded two milestones: on September15, he recorded his 479th save to pass Lee Smith for second all-time in regular season saves; on September21, in the final game at Yankee Stadium, Rivera threw the final pitch in the venue's history, retiring Brian Roberts of the Baltimore Orioles on a ground-out. After the Yankees missed the postseason {{for the first time in}} his career, Rivera disclosed that he had suffered from shoulder pain throughout the year. Tests revealed calcification of the acromioclavicular joint in his throwing shoulder, for which he underwent minor <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgery</b> in the offseason.|$|E
40|$|Background: Perioperative {{hypothermia}} {{can develop}} easily during shoulder arthroscopy, because cold irrigation can directly influence core body temperature. The authors investigated whether active warming and humidification of inspired gases reduces falls in core body temperature and allows redistribution of body heat in patients undergoing <b>arthroscopic</b> shoulder <b>surgery</b> under general anesthesia. Methods: Patients scheduled for <b>arthroscopic</b> shoulder <b>surgery</b> {{were randomly assigned}} to receive either room temperature inspired gases using a conventional respiratory circuit (the control group, n = 20) or inspired gases humidified and heated using a humidified and electrically heated circuit (HHC) (the heated group, n = 20). Results: Core temperatures were significantly lower in both groups from 30 min after anesthesia induction, but were significantly higher in the heated group than in the control group from 75 to 120 min after anesthesia induction. Conclusions: In this study the use of a humidified and electrically heated circuit did not prevent core temperature falling during <b>arthroscopic</b> shoulder <b>surgery,</b> but it was found to decrease reductions in core temperature from 75 min after anesthesia induction.

30|$|With {{the use of}} a {{standardized}} treatment algorithm no treatment modality was at significantly higher risk for having additional surgery. However, anatomic hemi-prosthesis should be viewed critically as a treatment option for PHFs. Complex fracture types, involvement of the medial calcar, cigarette-smoking and alcohol-abuse were associated with subsequent surgeries. Approximately one-third of subsequent <b>surgeries</b> were optional <b>arthroscopic</b> <b>surgeries</b> with the goal to improve the functional outcome, predominantly in the working population. Overall, patients with a surgical intervention after the primary treatment had a significantly lower Constant Score than patients without surgical intervention.|$|R
