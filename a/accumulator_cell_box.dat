30|$|The {{basic form}} of the Hough Transform, {{also known as the}} Standard Hough Transform (SHT) [13], has been {{established}} as the main technique for straight line detection [14 – 16]. The line detection problem is transformed by the SHT into a peak detection problem. Each feature point, obtained from a previous pre-processing stage such as edge detection, is mapped to a sine curve following the expression d=x cos(θ)+y sin(θ). The parameter space defined by (θ,d) is discretized into finite intervals, called <b>accumulator</b> <b>cells</b> or bins, giving rise to the Hough space (also referred to as the accumulator array). Using this discrete version of the parameter space, each feature point votes for the lines passing through it by incrementing the <b>accumulator</b> <b>cells</b> that lie along the corresponding curve. After this voting process, lines are located at those positions forming local maxima in the Hough space.|$|R

40|$|A metro {{system is}} a railway {{transport}} system in an urban area with a high capacity, frequency and the grade separation from other traffic. An elevated metro system is more preferred type of metro system due to ease of construction and also it makes urban areas more accessible without any construction difficulty. An elevated metro system has two major elements pier and box girder. The present study focuses on two major elements, pier and box girder, of an elevated metro structural system. Conventionally the pier of a metro bridge is designed using a force based approach. During a seismic loading, the behaviour of a single pier elevated bridge relies mostly on the ductility and the displacement capacity. It is important to check the ductility of such single piers. Force based methods do not explicitly check the displacement capacity during the design. The codes are now moving towards a performance-based (displacement-based) design approach, which consider the design as per the target performances at the design stage. Performance of a pier designed by a Direct Displacement Based Design is {{compared with that of}} a force-based designed one. The design of the pier is done by both force based seismic design method and direct displacement based seismic design method {{in the first part of}} the study. In the second part, a parametric study on behaviour of box girder bridges is carried out by using finite element method. The finite element model is validated with model of Gupta et al. (2010). The parameters considered to present the behaviour of Single <b>Cell</b> <b>Box</b> Girder, Double <b>Cell</b> <b>Box</b> Girder and Triple <b>Cell</b> <b>Box</b> Girder bridges are radius of curvature, span length and span length to the radius of curvature ratio.

The basic building block of an accumulator unit is the adder cell and data storage registers e. g. Flip-Flop (FF). The operational speed of FF determines the correctness and accuracy of the functionality of 12 BDA. The high-speed full adders that use low power consumption is a fundamental arithmetic operation {{that can never be}} neglected in accumulator unit, and {{it is one of the}} speed-limiting elements. The efficiency of the accumulator unit is determined by the adder cell taken in to account. In this paper, a 12 -Bit pipelined <b>accumulator</b> <b>cell</b> optimized for low power and high speed operation are proposed. Update rates of 150 MHz are achieved by careful choice of architecture. The static, D-type flip flops used in the pipeline architecture are the dominant source of power dissipation. Hence the refresh-every-cycle operation of accumulators is exploited by using dynamic delay elements to reduce power consumption The accumulator unit is simulated with mentor graphics using the 130 nm CMOS technology at different supply voltages ranges.
