5|$|The prosperous {{industry}} {{which had}} sprung {{up around the}} new iron industry required vast numbers of largely unskilled workers to mine ironstone {{and work in the}} blast furnace plants. Coatbridge therefore became a popular destination for vast numbers of Irish (especially from County Donegal in Ulster) arriving in Scotland. The iron bars and plates produced in Coatbridge iron works were the raw materials needed throughout the British Empire for railways, construction, bridge building and shipbuilding. One example of uses Coatbridge' iron was put to included <b>armour</b> <b>plating</b> for British ships fighting in the Crimean War.|$|E
5|$|In {{military}} ordnance, tungsten or uranium {{is used in}} <b>armour</b> <b>plating</b> and armour piercing projectiles, as well as {{in nuclear}} weapons to increase efficiency (by reflecting neutrons and momentarily delaying the expansion of reacting materials). In the 1970s, tantalum was found to be more effective than copper in shaped charge and explosively formed anti-armour weapons on account of its higher density, allowing greater force concentration, and better deformability. Less-toxic heavy metals, such as copper, tin, tungsten, and bismuth, and probably manganese (as well as boron, a metalloid), have replaced lead and antimony in the green bullets used by some armies and in some recreational shooting munitions. Doubts have been raised about the safety (or green credentials) of tungsten.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{protection}} scheme of the Yamato class still suffered from several major design flaws and shortcomings. The torpedo defense system performed substantially worse than designed; in particular, very poor jointing between the upper-belt and lower-belt armour created a rupture-prone seam {{just below the}} waterline, causing the class to be susceptible to torpedoes. Other structural weaknesses existed near {{the bow of the}} vessels, where the <b>armour</b> <b>plating</b> was generally thinner. These deficiencies proved crucial, particularly for the first two members of the class when they were each seriously damaged by submarine torpedoes in 1943 and then sunk by torpedo bombers in 1944–45. The hull of the Shinano was subject to even greater structural weaknesses, being hastily constructed {{near the end of the}} war and having been equipped with incomplete armour and unsealed watertight compartments at the time of her sinking.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: In {{the combat}} {{vehicles}} many materials {{can be used}} for the armour. Application of the monolithic <b>armour</b> <b>plates</b> in light combat vehicles is limited by the high armour weigh. Introduction of the layered <b>armour</b> <b>plates</b> is a way to limit the vehicle weight. In the paper test results of graded and nanostructural GMA surfaced <b>armour</b> <b>plates</b> are presented. Design/methodology/approach: Metallographic structure, chemical composition and hardness of surfaced layers were investigated in order to examine the influence of the layered <b>armour</b> <b>plate</b> construction on penetration failure mechanism. EDS chemical microanalysis was carried out on the cross section of surfaced <b>armour</b> <b>plates</b> to find the correlation between the structure components distribution, a GMA surfaced layer thickness and the <b>armour</b> <b>plates</b> ballistic resistance. Findings: The experimental tests confirmed a high ballistic resistance of the GMA surfaced <b>armour</b> <b>plates</b> against B- 32 armour-piercing incendiary projectile. The special microstructure of nanostructural deposited metal provides high hardness and resistance against impact load. Practical implications: In order to achieve a high ballistic resistance of GMA surfaced armour, nanostructural layer thickness of at least 4. 5 [mm] is needed. To optimize the <b>armour</b> <b>plate</b> weight and high ballistic resistance the ratio of soft austenite under-layer thickness and total <b>armour</b> <b>plate</b> thickness need to be tested. Originality/value: The special microstructure of nanostructural deposited metal, provides high hardness and resistance against impact load...|$|R

5|$|The Avro Ansons of No. 16 Group's No. 500 Squadron {{was fitted}} out with extra <b>armour</b> <b>plating</b> and side {{mountings}} for defensive guns. A free mounted 20mm {{was installed in}} the lower fuselage to offer protection. Though no evidence exists to indicate it was a success, crews appreciated the extra security. The British Cannon Manufacturing Company, impressed with the innovation, built a specialised mount for it. They began operations along with Fairey Battles of No. 12 Squadron RAF and No. 142 Squadron RAF, Bomber Command, operating from Eastchurch. Some conversions were made; No. 217 switched to Beauforts in May 1940, but still operated some Anson aircraft, and No. 502 received the Whitley in October 1940, a bitter disappointment for its crews.|$|E
5|$|In early 1968, the Soviet Ministry of Defence {{decided to}} develop a {{specialised}} shturmovik armoured assault aircraft {{in order to provide}} close air support for the Soviet Ground Forces. The idea of creating a ground-support aircraft came about after analysing the experience of ground-attack (shturmovaya) aviation during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. The Soviet fighter-bombers in service or under development at the time (Su-7, Su-17, MiG-21 and MiG-23) did not meet the requirements for close air support of the army. They lacked essential <b>armour</b> <b>plating</b> to protect the pilot and vital equipment from ground fire and missile hits, and their high flight speeds made it difficult for the pilot to maintain visual contact with a target. Having taken into account these problems, Pavel Sukhoi and a group of leading specialists in the Sukhoi Design Bureau started preliminary design work in a comparatively short period of time, with the assistance of leading institutes of the Ministry of the Aviation Industry and the Ministry of Defence.|$|E
5|$|Issued by MI6 with an Aston Martin DB Mark III, Bond trails Goldfinger as {{he takes}} his vintage Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost (adapted with <b>armour</b> <b>plating</b> and armour-plated glass) via air ferry to Switzerland, driven by Oddjob. Bond manages to trace Goldfinger to a {{warehouse}} in Geneva where he finds that the armour of Goldfinger's car is actually white-gold, cast into panels at his Kent refinery. When the car reaches Goldfinger's factory in Switzerland (Enterprises Auric AG), he recasts the gold from the armour panels into aircraft seats and fits them to the Mecca Charter Airline, in which he holds a large stake. The gold is finally sold in India at a vast profit. Bond foils an assassination attempt on Goldfinger by Jill Masterton's sister, Tilly, to avenge Jill's death at Goldfinger's hands: he had painted her body with gold paint, which killed her. Bond and Tilly attempt to escape when the alarm is raised, but are captured.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1942, the H-11, based on the H-3 was introduced. With the H-11, the Luftwaffe had at its {{disposal}} a powerful medium bomber with heavier armour and revised defensive armament. The drum-fed 7.92mm (.312in) MG 15 was replaced with a belt-fed 13mm (.51in) MG 131 in the now fully enclosed dorsal position (B-Stand); the gunner in the latter was now protected with armoured glass. The single MG 15 in the ventral C-Stand or Bola was also replaced, with a belt-fed 7.92mm (.312in) MG 81Z with much higher rate of fire. The beam positions originally retained the single MG 15s, but the H-11/R1 replaced these with twin MG 81Z as well; this latter arrangement was standardized in November 1942. The port internal ESAC bomb racks could be removed, and an 835L (221US gal) fuel tanks installed in its place. Many H-11s were equipped with a new PVC rack under the fuselage, which carried five 250kg (550lb) bombs. Additional <b>armour</b> <b>plating</b> was fitted around crew spaces, some {{of it on the}} lower fuselage and could be jettisoned in an emergency. Engines were two 1,000kW (1,340hp) Junkers Jumo 211F-2, allowing this variant to carry a 2,000kg (4,410lb) payload to a range of 2,340km (1,450mi). Heinkel built 230 new aircraft of this type and converted 100 H-3s to H-11s by {{the summer of}} 1943.|$|E
5|$|The Spitfire's {{airframe}} was complex: the streamlined, semi-monocoque duralumin fuselage {{featured a}} large number of compound curves built up from a skeleton of 19 formers, also known as frames, starting from frame number one, immediately behind the propeller unit, to the tail unit attachment frame. The first four frames supported the glycol header tank and engine cowlings. Frame 5, to which the engine bearers were secured, supported the weight of the engine and accessories, and the loads imposed by the engine. This was a strengthened double frame which also incorporated the fireproof bulkhead and, in later versions of the Spitfire, the oil tank. This frame also tied the four main fuselage longerons {{to the rest of the}} airframe. Behind the bulkhead were five 'U' shaped half-frames which accommodated the fuel tanks and cockpit. The rear fuselage started at the eleventh frame, to which the pilot's seat and (later) <b>armour</b> <b>plating</b> was attached, and ended at the nineteenth, which was mounted at a slight forward angle just forward of the fin. Each of these nine frames were oval, reducing in size towards the tail, and incorporated several lightening holes to reduce their weight as much as possible without weakening them. The U-shaped frame 20 was the last frame of the fuselage proper and the frame to which the tail unit was attached. Frames 21, 22 and 23 formed the fin; frame 22 incorporated the tailwheel opening and frame 23 was the rudder post. Before being attached to the main fuselage, the tail unit frames were held in a jig and the eight horizontal tail formers were riveted to them.|$|E

500|$|The battle, {{although}} it was strategically insignificant and {{had little effect on}} the outcome of the war, is notable as the first time modern ironclad warships had been used in action. [...] Although frequently hit, the French ships destroyed the Russian forts within three hours, suffering minimal casualties in the process.
