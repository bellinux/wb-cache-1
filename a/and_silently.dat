5|$|At the castle, Charles {{has begun}} to regret Madeleine's {{transformation}} and begs Murder to return her to life, but Murder refuses. Charles discovers he has been tainted by Murder's voodoo and is transforming into a zombie. As Neil enters the fortress, Murder senses his presence <b>and</b> <b>silently</b> orders Madeleine to kill Neil. She approaches Neil with a knife, but Bruner stops her. Neil follows Madeleine to an escarpment, where Murder commands his zombie guardians to kill Neil. Bruner approaches Murder and knocks him out, breaking Murder's mental control over his zombies. Undirected, the zombies topple off the cliff. Murder awakens and eludes Neil and Bruner, but Charles pushes Murder off the cliff. Charles loses his balance and also falls to his death. Murder's death releases Madeleine from her zombie trance, and she awakens to embrace Neil.|$|E
5|$|In {{this new}} institution, Neto angers the nurse Ivan after {{reporting}} to the hospital's superior that the nurse overreacted while trying to calm a patient. The nurse has it out for him, and when Ivan sees Neto faking to take a pill, he injects the drug through a syringe. That night, Neto, after doping a nurse, goes to the hospital stockroom and asks the inmate Biu to set fire to a stack of drugs. When Ivan discovers this, Neto receives solitary confinement. After being released from solitary, Neto writes {{a letter to his}} father <b>and</b> <b>silently</b> gives it to him when he visits. After refusing to have his hair cut, Neto is locked in solitary once again. He sets fires to the cage and is rescued by the nurses. After reading the letter, Wilson takes him from the clinic. The films ends as Wilson cries while he and Neto are seem seated side by side curbside.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} has been silently asked <b>and</b> <b>silently</b> answered, it seems. They are both afflicted and blessed, full of shared secrets, striving every moment. They are both impersonating someone. They are weary and beleaguered; they have taken on such enormous work.|$|E
60|$|The chief {{entered the}} cabin and took a seat near the door. He took a cup of milk and some meat <b>and</b> bread <b>silently,</b> <b>and</b> ate while {{listening}} to {{the talk of the}} settler.|$|R

25|$|Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 added {{self-healing}} ability, {{turned on}} by default, {{in addition to providing}} the CHKDSK command. It detects physical file system errors <b>and</b> <b>silently</b> fixes them on the fly. Thus, many problems previously discovered on running CHKDSK never appear. It is administered by fsutil repair command.|$|E
25|$|Before the daybreak, Mendonça {{addressed}} his men. To {{counter the}} odds of {{the large number of}} European troops, he encouraged them to fight in close quarters while maintaining their formations. After the speech they advanced to within musket range of the Dutch line <b>and</b> <b>silently</b> waited for the signal from the fort.|$|E
25|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the unusually great height of the corn, the French line of skirmishers, strengthened by whole battalions so as to give then a decided superiority over that of the Prussians, approached so cautiously <b>and</b> <b>silently</b> as to continue unperceived until they suddenly possessed themselves of the outermost hedges and gardens.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{streamed}} imperceptibly {{toward the}} door <b>and</b> flowed <b>silently</b> out.|$|R
60|$|He paused. Watty {{laid his}} face in the bedclothes, <b>and</b> wept <b>silently.</b>|$|R

25|$|All players {{review their}} cards <b>and</b> <b>silently</b> {{determine}} their bids. The player to the dealer's left initiates the bidding process. If the player has a meld, {{he or she}} is required to open the bidding; otherwise, they may pass or bid. If he or she passes, the obligation to bid passes to the next player, if meld is held. Once a player passes, {{he or she is}} out of the auction.|$|E
25|$|Thus {{the young}} Chinaman's proud dream {{of one day}} riding through the gates of Peking and beholding the palace (yamen) of his fabulously mighty emperor, {{as well as of}} perhaps securing, through my recommendation, a lucrative post, and finally, though by no means last in his estimation, of exchanging the Turki wife he had left behind in Khotan for a Chinese bride—this proud dream was pricked at the foot of Arka-tagh. Sadly <b>and</b> <b>silently</b> he stood alone in the desert, gazing after us, as we {{continued}} our way towards the far-distant goal of his youthful ambition.|$|E
25|$|On 29 October, Captain Guingret led 54 {{men of the}} 6th Light Infantry Regiment {{across the}} Duero River at Tordesillas. The {{soldiers}} stripped naked <b>and</b> <b>silently</b> swam across the river, towing a raft with their weapons. Taking up their muskets, they attacked the bridge guard which consisted of a half-company of the Brunswick Oels Jägers. Surprised and attacked from an unexpected direction, the Brunswick officer and his men fled, allowing the French to capture the bridge along with nine prisoners, while suffering no losses. The seizure of a bridge to the west compromised Wellington's defensive line. Though Wellington managed to contain the French bridgehead, {{he was forced to}} order a retreat.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Grooten {{leaned back}} in his chair <b>and</b> laughed <b>silently,</b> yet with obvious enjoyment.|$|R

25|$|On {{the ninth}} day, Changing Woman felt her birth labor begin. Talking God appeared, {{carrying}} a rope of sunbeam. Water Sprinkler the Rain God appeared carrying a rope of rainbow. Saying nothing, the two beings gave {{one end of}} each rope to Changing Woman <b>and</b> <b>silently</b> bid her pull them with each spasm of labor. This began the custom of giving a rope {{to a woman who}} is in labor. A baby boy emerged, and Talking God took it aside and washed it, and severed its cord. A second baby boy emerged, and Water Sprinkler took it aside and washed it and severed its cord.|$|E
25|$|Participants in the {{memorial}} service paddle out to a suitable location with flower leis around their necks or with loose flowers (sometimes held between their teeth). The participants then get into a circular formation, hold hands, <b>and</b> <b>silently</b> pray. Sometimes they will raise their clasped hands skyward before tossing their flowers or leis {{into the center of}} the ring. Afterward, they paddle back toward the beach to begin their surf session. Often these services take place at sunrise or sunset. In locations with a pier, such as Huntington Beach, Orange County, California, the service can take place near the end of the pier so that any non-surfers, such as elderly relatives, can watch and participate. Often the participants on the pier will throw down bouquets of flowers {{into the center of the}} ring.|$|E
500|$|In {{publications}} {{subsequent to}} Aunt Fanny's of 1852, Victorian nicety required editors to routinely <b>and</b> <b>silently</b> alter Southey's [...] "here she sate till {{the bottom of}} the chair came out, and down came her's, plump upon the ground" [...] to read [...] "and down she came", omitting any reference to the human bottom. The cumulative effect of the several changes to the tale since its original publication was to transform a fearsome oral tale into a cozy family story with an unrealized hint of menace.|$|E
25|$|Great Britain <b>and</b> Germany <b>silently</b> {{approved}} {{the invasion of}} the country, while Italy protested in vain.|$|R

500|$|According to Pechersky's plan, {{the prisoners}} would assassinate the German SS staff, thereby {{rendering}} the auxiliary guards leaderless, obtain weapons, {{and eliminate the}} remaining guards. Individual Polish Jewish inmates were assigned specific German SS guards that {{they were supposed to}} lure inside the workshops under some pretext <b>and</b> <b>silently</b> kill. Ester Raab, a survivor of the escape, recalled: [...] "The plan was, at 4 o’clock (pm), should start (the escape), everybody has to kill his SS man, and his guard at his place of work." [...] Only a small circle of trusted Polish Jewish inmates were aware of the escape plan as they didn't trust the Jews from other European countries.|$|E
500|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{learns that}} black {{employee}} Martin Nash (Wayne Wilderson) {{is a former}} criminal, and tells the entire office. During this time, in a misguided effort to avoid issues of stereotyping and racism Michael asks the employees to name a white person that they trust and he will name a black person he trusts even more. The name Jesus pops up and Michael replies with Apollo Creed. Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) encourages Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) to pursue Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), and intentionally gives him information about her strong dislikes. Later, Andy strums [...] "The Rainbow Connection" [...] on his banjo while singing falsetto. Pam smiles politely <b>and</b> <b>silently</b> shares the joke with Jim.|$|E
500|$|The eighth series {{sees the}} return of Oleg Darshavin, one of Lucas's former interrogators during his imprisonment. During his interrogations, Lucas had {{developed}} Stockholm syndrome, and his interrogator had managed to deconstruct him {{almost to the point}} of being turned and wanting to die. Lucas also becomes involved with CIA liaison officer Sarah Caufield. The initial power struggle between them ends up in a [...] "torrid love affair," [...] which is monitored by the team. When Ruth Evershed (Nicola Walker) returns in the series, Lucas [...] "really takes control of her position", in a similar manner to Harry and Ros's actions during Lucas's return. Armitage described Lucas's friendship with Ros as a [...] "good combo"; while Lucas likes to play the [...] "" [...] with [...] "all guns blazing" [...] Ros would [...] "slip around the back <b>and</b> <b>silently</b> slit a throat." ...|$|E

500|$|Greene {{and middle}} linebacker Jack Lambert became the {{emotional}} leaders of Pittsburgh's defensive squad. Greene {{was described as}} a huge presence {{both on and off the}} field. Once, in the locker room, a teammate was loudly voicing his discontent over the long and cold practice they had just gone through as he yanked off his equipment. At a nearby locker, Greene lifted his head <b>and</b> <b>silently</b> glared at him. [...] "Believe me, that's all Joe did, he never even said anything," [...] Joe Gordon of the Steelers front office recalled. [...] "I don't think the other players saw Joe glare at him. I think the other player just felt it, and then he sat down and never said another word." [...] A natural leader, Greene was named the captain of the defense in 1977. His leadership was also channeled to the offense; Lynn Swann, a wide receiver, considered Greene a mentor. [...] "If you were giving less than 100 percent, he let you know one way or the other," [...] said Swann.|$|E
500|$|Cutts ordered Brigadier-General Archibald Rowe's brigade to attack. The English {{infantry}} {{rose from}} the edge of the Nebel, <b>and</b> <b>silently</b> marched towards Blenheim, a distance of some [...] John Ferguson's Scottish brigade supported Rowe's left, and moved in perfect order towards the barricades between the village and the river, defended by Hautefeuille's dragoons. As the range closed to within , the French fired a deadly volley. Rowe had ordered that there should be no firing from his men until he struck his sword upon the palisades, but as he stepped forward to give the signal, he fell mortally wounded. The survivors of the leading companies closed up the gaps in their torn ranks and rushed forward. Small parties penetrated the defences, but repeated French volleys forced the English back towards the Nebel, sustaining heavy casualties. As the attack faltered, eight squadrons of elite Gens d'Armes, commanded by the veteran Swiss officer, Beat-Jacques von Zurlauben, fell upon the English troops, cutting at the exposed flank of Rowe's own regiment. However, Wilkes' Hessian brigade, lying nearby in the marshy grass at the water's edge, stood firm and repulsed the Gens d'Armes with steady fire, enabling the English and Hessians to re-order and launch another attack.|$|E
500|$|Clair {{is portrayed}} by American actress Phylicia Rashad. In {{addition}} to appearing in minor roles on both television and Broadway, Rashad had a recurring role as Courtney Wright on {{the soap opera}} One Life to Live before Cosby personally selected her to play his character's wife. Several actresses auditioned for the role, the majority of whom tended to resort to angrily yelling and moving their heads {{in a manner similar}} to that of a bobblehead doll when scolding the child actors playing the character's children during their auditions. However, Rashad's subtle interpretation was different from those of her competitors; when the actress screen tested opposite actor Malcolm Jamal-Warner, who would ultimately go on to portray son Theo, Rashad simply paused, stared <b>and</b> <b>silently</b> gave him [...] "a look" [...] instead of immediately scolding the character that, according to Cosby, meant [...] "four or five things ... and none of them were good." [...] At the end of Rashad's audition, Cosby announced [...] " [...] Clair" [...] to Carsey. Additionally, because Clair was still intended to be of Dominican heritage at the time, Rashad's own bilingualism and fluency in Spanish benefited her successful casting. Cosby told Rashad that she won the role because she acted [...] "with a knowing look in [...] eye." ...|$|E
