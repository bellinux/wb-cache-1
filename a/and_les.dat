5|$|English doctor Maxwell (Shearsmith) {{settles into}} bunk 9E while {{travelling}} from Paris to Bourg-Saint-Maurice. Maxwell is disturbed first by Jorg (Pemberton), a drunk, flatulent German who climbs into bunk 9D, then by Kath (Hesmondhalgh) <b>and</b> <b>Les</b> (Benton), a couple travelling to their daughter's wedding. Jorg is in Les's bed, but the couple climb into 9A. Australian backpacker Shona (Gunning) enters; she places her bag on bunk 9C then leaves, and Maxwell closes the door. Kath <b>and</b> <b>Les,</b> laughing at Maxwell, begin to undress on the bed. Les wakes Jorg, but understanding is limited until Maxwell translates. Jorg switches to 9F <b>and</b> <b>Les</b> climbs into 9D.|$|E

5|$|The Act 3 ballet is {{regarded}} {{by some as}} {{the first of the}} ballets blancs (whereby the principal ballerina and the corps de ballet are all clothed in white) which became a favourite of the nineteenth-century repertoire.

40|$|Human F <b>and</b> <b>Le</b> {{interferon}} can {{be clearly}} distinguished {{on the basis}} of different antigenic properties and host range. After inoculation with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), GM- 258 fibroblasts produced Le as well as F interferon; in contrast, only F interferon was detectable after stimulation with poly(I). poly(C). Polyadenylylated mRNA isolated from fibroblasts induced with poly(I). poly(C) or NDV was injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes and the interferon activities thus produced were analyzed. Only F interferon production was demonstrable in oocytes injected with mRNA from cells induced with poly(I). poly(C), whereas both F <b>and</b> <b>Le</b> interferons were made in oocytes injected with mRNA from NDV-induced cultures. The time course of accumulation of F <b>and</b> <b>Le</b> interferon mRNAs in NDV-induced cells corresponded to the kinetics of F <b>and</b> <b>Le</b> interferon synthesis in intact cells. The ratio of F <b>and</b> <b>Le</b> interferons made in oocytes was similar to that observed in intact GM- 258 cells. F <b>and</b> <b>Le</b> interferon mRNA activities isolated from GM- 258 cells could not be separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. However, the profile of F mRNA activity was more heterogeneous and its peak sedimented somewhat more slowly than that of Le interferon mRNA. These results suggest that the varying ratios of F <b>and</b> <b>Le</b> interferon synthesis in different cells after different modes of stimulation are determined at the level of mRNA. The induction mechanisms of F <b>and</b> <b>Le</b> interferon mRNA synthesis appear to be closely related but not identical...|$|R
5|$|After dawn, Les accidentally wakes Maxwell, but {{sees that}} Kath is absent. The train brakes, waking everyone, and Hugo and the corpse {{fall to the}} floor.

Shona sees that the train has hit a deer, and Kath re-enters.|$|E

5|$|Due to the Parisian uprisings {{during the}} Fronde civil war, Louis XIV moved his court {{to a new}} palace, Versailles, in 1682. Although no longer the capital of France, arts and {{sciences}} in the city flourished with the Comédie-Française, the Academy of Painting, and the French Academy of Sciences. To demonstrate {{that the city was}} safe from attack, the king had the city walls demolished and replaced with tree-lined boulevards that would become the Grands Boulevards of today.

5|$|Ken Levine {{remarked that}} the whole {{audience}} laughed during the filming of an office scene between Coach and his daughter {{at the end of}} the episode. It was reshot but the audience still laughed. Glen <b>and</b> <b>Les</b> Charles decided to lift the laughter from the office scene, so it is not heard in the final cut. Before portraying Tim—a minor insignificant character—in multiple episodes, Tim Cunningham portrays Chuck, who works at the lab that mutates viruses. Jacqueline Cassel and Teddy Bergeron are credited as a couple, to whom Diane shows her botched artwork.|$|E
