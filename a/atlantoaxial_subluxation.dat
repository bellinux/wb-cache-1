40|$|Background/Purpose: To {{improve the}} {{recognition}} of articulating facet displacement of lateral atlantoaxial joint (AFDLAJ), and to evaluate the significance of AFDLAJ in diagnosing <b>atlantoaxial</b> <b>subluxation.</b> Methods: The three-dimensional computed tomography (3 D CT) imaging findings of 54 patients with <b>atlantoaxial</b> <b>subluxation</b> were retrospectively analyzed, and the imaging features of AFDLAJ were discussed. All the patients were examined in neutral position, and 25 in an additional rotary position. 3 D images of the atlantoaxial joints were obtained by surface shade display and volume rendering. The diagnostic results of 3 D CT, routine CT and X-ray were compared. Results: All the 54 patients with <b>atlantoaxial</b> <b>subluxation</b> were correctly diagnosed by 3 D CT with no suspicious or missed diagnoses, including 38 cases of rotatory subluxation, 11 of anterior subluxation and five of posterior subluxation. AFDLAJ was found in all the 54 patients in neutral position, with the extent of subluxation between 2. 0 mm and 9. 0 mm.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN. A case report. OBJECTIVE. To raise {{awareness}} {{of the development of}} atlantoaxial rotatory fixation (AARF) in the setting of congenital vertebral anomalies/malformations. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Klippel-Feil Syndrome (KFS) is a complex, heterogeneous condition noted as congenital fusion of 2 or more cervical vertebrae with or without spinal or extraspinal manifestations. Although believed to be a rare occurrence in the population, KFS may be underreported. Proper diagnosis of KFS and other congenital conditions affecting the spine is imperative to devise proper management protocols and avoid potential complications resulting from the altered biomechanics associated with such conditions and their abnormal vertebral morphology. Craniovertebral dislocation and AARF may cause severe cervicomedullary and spinal cord compression and could thereby be potentially fatal, especially in patients with KFS who present with congenitally-associated comorbidities. METHODS. A 13 -year-old boy with Chiari type I malformation, craniofacial abnormalities, and other irregularities underwent thoracolumbar spine surgery for his scoliosis curve correction at another institution, which immediately following surgery he became a quadriparetic. The initial preoperative assessment of his cervical spine was limited and the associated KFS was initially undiagnosed. At 14 years of age, he presented to our clinic with an ASIA-C spinal cord injury. Plain radiographs, normal and 3 -dimensional reformatted computed tomographs (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) noted assimilation of the patient's occiput to the atlas (occipitalization) with congenital fusion of C 2 -C 3, indicative of KFS, and the presence of anterior craniovertebral dislocation with a Fielding and Hawkins type II AARF. Closed reduction of the craniovertebral dislocation was noted, but his <b>atlantoaxial</b> rotatory <b>subluxation</b> was nonresponsive and fixed (AARF). As such, at the age of 14, the patient underwent posterior instrumentation and fusion from the occiput to C 4 to maintain reduction of thecraniovertebral dislocation and reduce his AARF. RESULTS. At 9 months postoperative follow-up of his craniovertebral surgery, the instrumentation remained intact, reduction of the <b>atlantoaxial</b> rotatory <b>subluxation</b> was maintained, and posterior bone fusion was noted. Neurologically, he remained an ASIA-C without any substantial return of function. CONCLUSION. This report raises awareness for the need of a thorough evaluation of the cervical spine to determine patients at high risk for craniovertebral dislocation and <b>atlantoaxial</b> rotatory <b>subluxation,</b> primarily in the context of KFS or other congenital conditions. Three-dimensional CT and MR imaging are ideal radiographic methods to determine the presence and extent of craniovertebral dislocation, AARF, and of abnormal vertebral anatomy/malformations. In addition, the authors propose a modification to the Fielding and Hawkins classification of AARF to include variants and subtypes that account for abnormal anatomy and congenital anomalies/malformations. © 2010 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Successful {{conservative}} {{treatment of}} rheumatoid subaxial subluxation resulting in improvement of myelopathy, reduction of subluxation, and stabilisation of the cervical spine. A report of two cases Johanna C M Oostveen, Martin A F J van de Laar, Jan A G Geelen, Ron de GraaV Objective—To report the eYcacy of con-servative treatment with cervical traction and immobilisation with a Halo vest, in two consecutive rheumatoid arthritis pa-tients with progressive cervical myelopa-thy caused by subaxial subluxation. Methods—Description of neurological symptoms and signs and findings in plain radiography (PR) and magnetic reso-nance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine {{before and after}} treatment of the subaxial subluxation by traction and immobilisa-tion with a Halo vest during four months. Results—During four months of traction and immobilisation neurological exami-nation showed a considerable improve-ment of the {{signs and symptoms of}} cervical myelopathy. Afterwards PR and MRI of the cervical spine showed reduc-tion of the subaxial subluxation. Eventu-ally firm stabilisation was obtained in both patients without surgery of the cervi-cal spine. Conclusion—Cervical traction and immo-bilisation with a Halo vest can be consid-ered as an independent conservative treatment in rheumatoid arthritis pa-tients with cervical myelopathy caused by subaxial subluxation. (Ann Rheum Dis 1999; 58 : 126 – 129) Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) commonly aVects the cervical spine. Radiographic abnormalities have been observed with a frequency of 19 % to 88 %, depending on the patients studied. 1 The most common abnormalities are <b>atlantoaxial</b> <b>subluxations</b> (AAS).

40|$|Background: The {{management}} of odontoid fracture has evolved but controversy persists {{as to the}} best method for Type II odontoid fractures with or without atlantoaxial (AA) instability. The anterior odontoid screw fixation {{can be associated with}} significant morbidity while delayed odontoid screw fixation has shown to be associated with reasonable good fusion rates. We conducted a retrospective analysis to evaluate the outcome of a trial of conservative management in type II odontoid fractures without atlantoaxial instability (Group A) followed by delayed odontoid screw fixation in cases in which fusion was not achieved by conservative treatment. The outcome of type II odontoid fracture with AA subluxation (Group B) was also analysed where closed reduction on traction could be achieved and in those <b>atlantoaxial</b> <b>subluxations</b> that were irreducible an intraoperative reduction was done. Materials and Methods: A retrospective evaluation of 53 cases of odontoid fractures treated over a 9 -year period is being reported. All odontoid fractures without AA instability (n= 29) were initially managed conservatively. Three patients who did not achieve union with conservative management were treated with delayed anterior screw fixation. Twenty-four cases of odontoid fractures were associated with AA instability; 17 of them could be reduced with skeletal traction and were managed with posterior fusion and fixation. Of the seven cases that were irreducible, the initial three cases were treated by odontoid excision followed by posterior fusion and fixation; however, in the later four cases, intra operative reduction was achieved by a manipulation procedure, and posterior fusion and fixation was performed. Results: Twenty-six of 29 cases of odontoid fracture without AA instability achieved fracture union with conservative management whereas the remaining three patients achieved union following delayed anterior odontoid screw fixation. 17 out of 24 odontoid fracture with atlantoaxial dislocation could be reduced on traction and these patients underwent posterior fusion and fixation. Optimal or near optimal reduction was achieved by on table manipulation in four cases which were irreducible with skeletal traction. Atlantoaxial stability was achieved in all cases. All cases were noted to be stable on evaluation with x-rays at six months. Conclusions: The initial conservative management and use of odontoid screw fixation only in cases where conservative management for 6 - 12 weeks has failed to provide fracture union have shown good outcome in type II odontoid fracture without AA instability rates. Intraoperative manipulation and reduction in patients where AA subluxation failed to reduce on skeletal traction followed by posterior fusion obviates the need for transoral odontoid excision...|$|R

40|$|Background Chiari {{malformation}} type Ⅰ(CM-Ⅰ) {{is one of}} {{the soft}} tissue anomalies in craniovertebral junction (CVJ). This kind of soft tissue anomaly usually develops with bone anomaly, such as <b>atlantoaxial</b> <b>subluxation,</b> basilar invagination, platybasia, C 1 assimilation, etc. For these complex combined anomalies, the treatment remains unaddressed. This study was performed to evaluate the effect of posterior reduction and internal fixation with posterior cranial fossa cranioectomy decompression for Chiari malformation type Ⅰ with basilar invagination, <b>atlantoaxial</b> <b>subluxation,</b> and syringomyelia. Methods Patients with basilar invagination and <b>atlantoaxial</b> <b>subluxation</b> treated from July 2004 to September 2011 were reviewed. Including criterions were made to screen matching patients. Including patients were retrospectively analyzed on both clinical outcomes and radiographical results. Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score was used to evaluate the clinical outcomes, while the syrinx maximum size was measured on transverse view of MRI T 2 image. The results were analyzed by SPSS 17. 0 using t -text. Significant difference was considered when P ≤ 0. 05. Results Fourteen patients met the including criterions, including 4 male patients and 10 female patients, {{with a mean age of}} 31. 86 ± 11. 36 (standard deviation, range: 17 - 51) years. Mean JOA score preoperatively of 14 patients was 13. 07 ± 1. 59 (standard deviation), while that was 15. 57 ± 1. 02 (standard deviation) postoperatively (t = 9. 946, P = 0. 000).

40|$|Purpose: Atlantoaxial rotatory {{fixation}} and <b>atlantoaxial</b> rotatory <b>subluxation</b> are {{the most}} frequent manifestations of atlantoaxial rotatory dislocation (AARD) in pediatric population and are often treated conservatively. The objective {{of this study is}} to correlate the changes highlighted on MRI T 2 -weighted and STIR sequences with the duration of conservative treatment. Methods: We analyzed nine consecutive patients treated surgically between 1 Jan 2006 and 1 Jan 2010 at the Policlinico Umberto I of Rome. All patients underwent cervical X-ray, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (T 1 and T 2 -weighted, STIR, angio MRI). All patients were treated with bed rest, muscle relaxants and cervical collar, and radiological follow-up with MRI and cervical X-ray was performed. Results: According to Fielding's classification, we observed seven patients with a type 1 subluxation and two patients with a type II subluxation. In type 1, STIR and T 2 sequences showed a hyperintensity in the alar and capsular ligaments and in the posterior ligamentous system, with integrity of the transverse ligament (LTA). In type 2, the hyperintensity also involved the LTA. During the follow-up, MRI showed a progressive reduction until the disappearance of the hyperintensity described, which was followed by a break with orthotic immobilization. Conclusions: MRI with STIR sequences appears to be useful in addressing the duration of conservative treatment in AARD. © Springer-Verlag 2012...|$|R

40|$|For {{preoperative}} {{evaluation of}} the vertebral artery (VA) at the craniovertebral junction, 3 -dimensional (3 -D) computed tomography (CT) angiography can simultaneously and precisely depict {{the location of the}} VA and the circumferential osseous tissues. However, this procedure has the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy, especially when patients have pre-existing renal impairment. We report the case of a 73 -year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis and concomitant chronic renal failure in whom severe myelopathy developed due to <b>atlantoaxial</b> vertical <b>subluxation</b> and subaxial subluxation. We planned to perform C 1 laminectomy and C 3 –C 7 laminoplasty, but to avoid the risk of intraoperative VA injury, we applied a fusion image technique of 3 -D magnetic resonance (MR) angiography and co-registered 3 -D CT that allowed for virtual assessment preoperatively of the VA courses, instead of 3 -D CT angiography. Through the 3 -D hybrid MR angiography–CT images, we could predict, in detail, the VA courses and the surrounding bony structures. At surgery, we found that the locations of the VAs were identical to that predicted on the preoperative image fusion analysis. We conclude that our image fusion techniques possess accurate diagnostic value for detecting arterial course, and could be applicable for patients in whom administration of contrast media should be avoided due to specific conditions, such as drug allergy and chronic renal failure...|$|R

This article describes {{a case of}} retro-odontoid cystic mass {{associated with}} chronic <b>atlantoaxial</b> <b>subluxation</b> and its management with posterior C 1 and partial C 2 laminectomy and C 1 -C 2 pedicle screw fixation without resection of the retro-odontoid cyst. A 64 -year-old woman experienced a sudden onset of neck pain, hand and foot paresthesia. Atlantoaxial instability associated with a retro-odontoid cystic mass {{was found in the}} imaging. The patient underwent posterior C 1 and partial C 2 laminectomy and C 1 -C 2 pedicle screws fixation without resection of the retro-odontoid cyst. During the 24 months followup period, the cyst disappeared completely and the patient remained symptom free and returned to independent daily living. These findings suggest that posterior laminectomy and fixation without resection of the retro-odontoid cyst is relatively simple and safe and the results are satisfactory...|$|E

After surgical intervention for the worsening of bulbar symptoms, clinical course of neurological complaints suggested that neurological involvement was due only to anterior/vertical AAS...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS Cervical {{myelopathy}} {{has become}} commonly {{recognized as a}} complication of rheumatoid <b>atlantoaxial</b> <b>subluxation.</b> A small group of patients with <b>atlantoaxial</b> <b>subluxation</b> may have inter-mittent symptoms associated with change of head position and which are due to vertebral artery compression. Two such cases are reported, one with necropsy findings of infarction in the area supplied by the vertebrobasilar system. The pathogenesis of the symptomatology and infarction is discussed. There are two important neurological syndromes that can arise from rheumatoid <b>atlantoaxial</b> <b>subluxation</b> (AAS). One is a compression myelopathy (Stevens et al., 1971; Smith et al., 1972) which can uncommonly be complicated by acute compression with tetraplegia or death (Davis and Markley, 1951). The other less common syndrome is that of ischaemic symptoms related to vertebrobasilar artery insufficiency. We have recently encountered two cases of this latter syndrome, one of which came to postmortem examination. Pathological re-ports are rare but a comparable case was reported by Webb et al. (1968). This was a 53 year old female with AAS and vertebral artery throm-bosis whose symptoms were intermittent. CASE 1 Mrs. M. H. is a 45 year old lady with a 15 year history of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis. Six months before admission she had one week of confused amnestic behaviour of uncertain aetiology. Since then, she has had repeated bouts of vertigo, as interpreted by a neurologist, without other symptoms associated with neck flexion or head rotation. On the day of admission she fell unconscious and had bilateral clonic movements. In the emergency roo...|$|E
40|$|One {{complication}} of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is {{the involvement of}} the cervical spine (CS). Although prophylactic stabilisation is recommended, the timing at which this should occur is poorly defined. The aim of our study was to evaluate the course of neurological symptoms in terms of the timing of surgery. A total of 34 patients with RA and CS involvement were surgically stabilised. These patients were classified using the Ranawat (RW) score both preoperatively and at an average of 54 months post-operatively. For each patient, the presence of <b>atlantoaxial</b> and subaxial <b>subluxation</b> as well as vertical migration of the odontoid was recorded. The anterior atlantodental interval was also assessed pre- and post-operatively. Improvement was obtained in 20 patients, the clinical situation remained unchanged in three patients and three patients manifested disease progression. In terms of the RW score, the 16 patients with pre-operative RW grades I–II showed no deterioration at the post-operative follow-up, with 13 of these patients showing an improvement; the 12 patients with pre-operative RW grades IIIA–IIIB did not show any improvement of neurological symptoms at follow-up, although seven of these patients subjectively assessed the symptoms to be less severe after surgery; three other patients showed a worsening of symptoms. Our results suggest that preventive stabilisation of CS in RA leads to acceptable results, although the complications of the surgery are obvious. However, early operative treatment may delay the detrimental course of cervical myelopathy in RA...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Atlantoaxial rotatory {{subluxation}} {{is rarely}} caused by trauma in adults.

This is the third reported case of surgical correction, and a favourable prognosis was achieved in all three cases using a ventral technique.
