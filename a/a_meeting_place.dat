The John Millington, a Grade II listed building, was formerly Millington Hall, built for Stockport alderman John Millington. A row of cottages near to the hall served as <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>place</b> for local Methodists from 1814, before a purpose-built chapel was established. A Sunday school was also established in the same place. The King's Hall was built in 1937, and was originally a dance hall before its conversion into a restaurant and public house.|$|E
5|$|Freemasons' Hall is the {{headquarters}} of the United Grand Lodge of England and the Supreme Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of England, as well as <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>place</b> for many Masonic Lodges in the London area. It is in Great Queen Street between Holborn and Covent Garden and has been a Masonic meeting place since 1775.

5|$|From the mid-20th century, {{the tunnel}} fell into disuse. It became popular with {{homeless}} people and drug users. A police report from around 1950 stated that squatters used the edifice for warmth and shelter from elements, {{as well as}} a hideout and <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>place.</b> The Yugoslav Government's lack of transparency regarding the tunnel led to the rise of a number of urban legends, including the purported existence of walled-off corridors leading towards the Croatian Parliament palace on St. Mark's Square (in the centre of Gornji Grad), and towards Zagreb Observatory (the northernmost point of the neighbourhood) and on to Gupčeva Zvijezda.|$|E

The following season, Shankly's last, they won the FA Cup again.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} Neolithic causewayed {{enclosures}} is unclear, {{and they probably}} had a variety of functions.

It was chartered by the Grand Lodge of Virginia on December 13, 1825. The lodge underwent four periods of hiatus: first, between 1838 and December 15, 1846; a second time between 1855 and its rechartering on July 3, 1857; a third time between 1861 and December 11, 1867, during the Civil War and Reconstruction; and a fourth time between November 29, 1881 and November 12, 1890, when it was again reactivated.|$|E

5|$|What is now Pentonville Road {{was built}} {{as the final}} section of the New Road in 1756, {{connecting}} the City of London to the western suburbs, so that coach traffic could avoid Central London. At the time, the route now covered by Pentonville Road was mostly fields, with Battle Bridge occupying the space where King's Cross now is. It included a tavern known as Busby's Folly, <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>place</b> of a drinking group known as the Society of Bull Feathers. It is marked on John Ogilby's map of London in 1675.

5|$|AFIS {{made several}} {{attempts}} {{to call up}} the aircraft. It {{received a call from}} a resident close to Torghatten which said they had heard aircraft noise followed by a crash. Brønnøysund Fire Department and an ambulance helicopter with a doctor was dispatched to Torghatten. The rescue work was made difficult by low clouds, small fires and explosions. The terrain was difficult and the lack of daylight made assisting the situation difficult. A helicopter with medical personnel and the airport direct arrived at 21:25, while <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>place</b> for the next of kin was established at the airport. At 23:30 the police stated that there was no hope of finding survivors and the scene changed from a search to an investigation scene. Due to the fog {{it was not possible to}} verify that all people had been killed until the next day. Seventy-five soldiers from the Home Guard participated in the salvage.|$|E
5|$|After his {{accession}} in Great Britain, George's {{relationship with}} his son (which had always been poor) worsened. George Augustus, Prince of Wales, encouraged opposition to his father's policies, including measures designed to increase religious freedom in Britain and expand Hanover's German territories {{at the expense of}} Sweden. In 1717 the birth of a grandson led to a major quarrel between George and the Prince of Wales. The King, supposedly following custom, appointed the Lord Chamberlain, the Duke of Newcastle, as one of the baptismal sponsors of the child. The King was angered when the Prince of Wales, disliking Newcastle, verbally insulted the Duke at the christening, which the Duke misunderstood as a challenge to a duel. The Prince was told to leave the royal residence, St. James's Palace. The Prince's new home, Leicester House, became <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>place</b> for the King's political opponents. George and his son were later reconciled at the insistence of Robert Walpole and the desire of the Princess of Wales, who had moved out with her husband but missed her children who had been left in the care of the King. However, following the quarrel at the baptism, father and son would never again be on cordial terms.|$|E

5|$|The {{band members}} all {{responded to this}} {{production}} method differently, with Iwadera and Kusakari finding the approach the easiest. Okazaki and Ejima both had trouble adopting this method. Okazaki was very anxious about her ability to create demos, having never used music software before, and not even owning a computer before moving to Tokyo. Yamaguchi bought her an iBook to help her with the process. Ejima found difficulty in recording demos due {{to the problem of}} recording drums at home for sound sampling. As a result, he learnt how to play the guitar. In June, the band were creating songs on a daily basis, and in August were still in the pre-production stages of the album. The album was created at Yamaguchi's apartment in Noborito in Kawasaki, Kanagawa, which became <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>place</b> for all of the band members for the album. In total, around thirty demo compositions were produced for the album. This method of song production also led to Yamaguchi being able to think of the album as a whole, as opposed to their methods on Go to the Future and Night Fishing, in which each song was thought of in its own individual context.|$|E
5|$|The {{facilities}} are utilised by the Route 26 Community Project, a registered charity {{based at the}} centre that works towards the betterment of lives in Deckham and neighbouring wards. The project works with Gateshead Council and the Gateshead Housing Company to provide a community cafe promoting healthy eating (the T–Junction), a gymnasium, indoor sports hall, outdoor Five-a-side football pitches and <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>place</b> for resident groups. The project has education provision for young children as a registered day–care provider and it also offers adult education and training. The project hosts the Carnival on the Hill/Deckham Festival, a collaborative enterprise between Route 26, Gateshead Council and Home Group, offering free activities such as go-karting and children's soft play, {{against the backdrop of}} a steel band. The second Carnival on the Hill was held on 3 September 2011 and attracted more than 1,000 visitors, including the Mayor of Gateshead and BBC local weatherman Paul Mooney.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{two other}} castles in the city, Kanō Castle and Kawate Castle, only have ruins marking their former presence, they have both had {{important}} roles in the city's past. Kanō Castle was built shortly after the Battle of Sekigahara when Tokugawa Ieyasu ordered the Toyotomi family to build it upon {{the ruins of a}} former medieval castle. Okudaira Nobumasa {{was the first person to}} live in the castle and he was followed by his descendants until the Meiji period. The castle's citadel ruins are designated a National Historic Site. Kawate Castle was used by the Toki clan while they were guarding Owari, Ise and Mino provinces as the Chief Retainer of the Shogunate during the Muromachi period. It was also used as <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>place</b> for the cultural and social elite from Kyoto. A stone monument near Seibi High School marks the castle's location.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis examines at how libraries {{can function}} as <b>meeting</b> <b>places</b> {{in areas with}} inhabitants from sevral different countries. It {{is done in the}} form of a case study, with interviews and observations, of a minilibrary in a part of Växjö. The results are analysed with the help of Ragnar Audunsons theory about high and low intensity <b>meeting</b> <b>places.</b> According to the theory <b>a</b> high intensity <b>meeting</b> <b>place</b> is where <b>a</b> person meets people who share their intrests, whereas <b>a</b> low intensity <b>meeting</b> <b>place</b> is where the person are exposed to diffrent views. This study finds that the minilibrary in question funtions as both a high and <b>a</b> low intensity <b>meeting</b> <b>place,</b> depending on the context. When the children and youth living in the area use it as a place to meet after school, the library functions as <b>a</b> high intensity <b>meeting</b> <b>place,</b> and when the library hosts language cafés it becomes <b>a</b> low intensity <b>meeting</b> <b>place...</b>|$|R
