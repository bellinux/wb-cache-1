5|$|There are {{two types}} of geysers: {{fountain}} geysers which erupt from pools of water, typically in a series of intense, even violent, bursts; and cone geysers which erupt from cones or mounds of siliceous sinter (including geyserite), usually in steady jets that last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. Old Faithful, perhaps the best-known geyser at Yellowstone National Park, is <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cone geyser. Grand Geyser, the tallest predictable geyser on earth, (although Geysir in Iceland is taller, it is not predictable), also at Yellowstone National Park, is <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fountain geyser.|$|E
5|$|A key {{stress on}} both {{freshwater}} and marine ecosystems is habitat degradation including water pollution, {{the building of}} dams, removal of water for use by humans, {{and the introduction of}} exotic species. <b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fish that has become endangered because of habitat change is the pallid sturgeon, a North American freshwater fish that lives in rivers damaged by human activity.|$|E
5|$|A villanelle (also {{known as}} villanesque) is a nineteen-line poetic form {{consisting}} of five tercets {{followed by a}} quatrain. There are two refrains and two repeating rhymes, with {{the first and third}} line of the first tercet repeated alternately until the last stanza, which includes both repeated lines. The villanelle is <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fixed verse form. The word derives from Latin, then Italian, and is related to the initial subject of the form being the pastoral.|$|E

5|$|An acid {{dissociation}} constant, Ka, (also {{known as}} acidity constant, or acid-ionization constant) is a quantitative {{measure of the}} strength of an acid in solution. It is the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction known as dissociation in the context of acid–base reactions. and the constants for dissociation of successive protons as Ka2, etc. Phosphoric acid, H3PO4, is <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> polyprotic acid as it can lose three protons.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{developing}} nation establishing its own {{model of}} emergency medicine {{may be seen}} in southern Brazil. Elements of both of the major conventional models have been incorporated, with the EMS system following French influences and the ambulances being staffed by physicians, while an American approach to emergency medical residency training is also present.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{medicinal}} {{enzyme inhibitor}} is sildenafil (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound {{is a potent}} inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, the enzyme that degrades the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate. This signalling molecule triggers smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases {{the activity of the}} enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last {{for a longer period of}} time.|$|E

Casein-based Mozzarella-like imitation processed cheeses prepared using rennet are also used as a Mozzarella substitute on frozen pizzas.|$|E

5|$|An old {{qualitative}} {{test for}} the presence of the alkene functional group is that alkenes turn brown aqueous bromine solutions colourless, forming a bromohydrin with some of the dibromoalkane also produced.
