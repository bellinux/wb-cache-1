5|$|Draw by agreement: Draws {{are most}} {{commonly}} reached {{by mutual agreement}} between the players. The correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw, make a move, then start the opponent's clock. Traditionally, players {{have been allowed to}} agree to a draw <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the game, occasionally even without playing a move; in recent years efforts have been made to discourage short draws, for example by forbidding draw offers before move thirty.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 No.6 Squadron's F-111Cs were {{replaced}} by F-111Gs which had been purchased from the USAF in 1992 {{to be used for}} training purposes. This purchase allowed Australia's F-111Cs to be used mainly for strike and reconnaissance purposes and extended the type's expected life in RAAF service. All the F-111Gs were assigned to No,6 Squadron, and the unit's F-111C and RF-111C aircraft were transferred to No.1 Squadron. The squadron typically had seven F-111Gs operational <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> time.|$|E
5|$|While FireRed and LeafGreen are remakes of Red and Green (Pokémon Green {{was only}} {{released}} in Japan, whereas the American version was Blue), they contain usability enhancements {{such as a}} contextual tutorial feature which allows players to look up data <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the game. Additionally, when continuing a saved game, players are shown the last four actions they performed, allowing them to remember what they were doing.|$|E

5|$|In 1962, Kestin and Persen {{published}} a paper describing solutions for heat transfer when the thermal boundary layer is contained entirely within the momentum layer and for various wall temperature distributions. For {{the problem of}} a flat plate with a temperature jump at , they propose a substitution that reduces the parabolic thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation. The solution to this equation, the temperature <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the fluid, can be expressed as an incomplete gamma function. Schlichting proposed an equivalent substitution that reduces the thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation whose solution is the same incomplete gamma function.|$|E
5|$|It's about obsession, {{and that}} can be scary because you're not in control and you don't know where it's going to stop. It says that, <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> {{somebody}}'s life, when they loved somebody strongly enough and that person returns, a certain touch, a certain physical gesture can turn them from being defiant and disgusted with this person to being subservient again. And it's not just a pleasurable feeling that comes back, it's the complete terror and loss of control that comes back. And I think that's ultimately a great weapon.|$|E
5|$|After playing bantam and Junior B in his {{hometown}} of Windsor, Jovanovski joined the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) with the Windsor Spitfires. In his rookie season with the Spitfires, Jovanovski led all team defencemen in scoring, with 50 points in 62 games. In addition to being voted as the Emms Division's top bodychecker by League coaches, he was named to the OHL's All-Rookie and Second All-Star Teams. That off-season, Jovanovski was selected first overall by the Florida Panthers in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. He admitted to being surprised at the top selection, as he had not been ranked first <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> his draft-eligible season. Czech prospect Radek Bonk was ranked first overall by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau, but Panthers President Bill Torrey preferred to select a defenceman over a forward.|$|E

5|$|Colorado's win {{clinched}} the team's second post-season berth in franchise history, {{and the first}} for their first baseman Todd Helton. The Rockies swept the Phillies in the 2007 National League Division Series and the Diamondbacks in the 2007 National League Championship Series (NLCS) to win the franchise's first National League pennant. This streak, {{in combination with the}} Rockies performance {{at the end of the}} season, meant the Rockies had won 21 of their last 22 games. The last National League team to win 20 of 21 games <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the season were the 1936 New York Giants. The Rockies also opened the playoffs with seven straight wins, the 1976 Cincinnati Reds were the only other team in major league history to do so. The Rockies moved on to the 2007 World Series with their NLCS win, where they were swept by the Boston Red Sox.|$|E
5|$|Completing {{objectives}} and defeating enemies is rewarded with experience points, {{which are used}} to unlock or upgrade existing disciplines and improve each characters' statistics, such as strength or agility. Weapons, armor, and other accessories can be purchased or upgraded using money or valuable items, which are collected throughout the game. The character's inventory is grid-based; objects occupy an allotted amount of space, requiring {{the management of the}} storage space available. A belt allows some items to be selected for immediate use during gameplay, such as healing items, without the need to access them in the main inventory. The first version of the game allows progress to be saved only in the main character's haven or safehouse; it automatically saves other data at specific points. An update to the game enabled players to save their in-game data <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the in-game narrative.|$|E
5|$|Planetarian is a post-apocalyptic visual {{novel in}} which the player assumes {{the role of the}} junker. Unlike {{traditional}} visual novels, no choices are given to the player in Planetarian to advance the story, and there is only one possible ending; this is what Key referred to as a kinetic novel. The player can choose when to advance to the next dialogue screen or put the game on auto play. In this respect, the player does not play the game {{as if it were a}} video game, but plays it rather more like one would play a music track on a CD or play a DVD film. During gameplay, the player can choose to hide the text from view and go back to any previous lines. The game can be saved <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> any of the five save slots available, and a load option is available where the player can load any of the automatically saved chapter markers, or choose to load any of the manually saved games.|$|E

5|$|Commander Keen in Keen Dreams is a side-scrolling {{platform}} video game: {{the majority}} of the game features the player-controlled Commander Keen viewed from the side while moving on a two-dimensional plane. The player character can move left and right and can jump; unlike the prior trilogy of episodes in the series, known collectively as Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, Keen cannot jump higher using a pogo stick. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, viewed from slightly above so as to give a pseudo-3D effect, and some platforms allow Keen to jump up through them from below, while others feature fireman's poles that Keen can climb up or down. Once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, though unlike in Vorticons the player can save their game <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>point.</b> <b>In</b> between levels the player travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance or save their progress in the game. Some levels are optional to enter and may be bypassed.|$|E
5|$|Once a {{particular}} level has been completed, the player {{is sent to}} the hub area, which features six portals to each of the individual levels and a gate that leads to the final boss. All the portals in the hub area, except for the first one, must be unlocked with keys that must be collected in the levels. The keys that unlock the portals to the second and third levels are found in the first level, the keys that unlock the portal to the fourth level are found in the second level, the keys that unlock the portal to the fifth level are found in the third level, and the keys that unlock the last level are found in the fourth and fifth levels. As a result, the game allows the player to complete certain levels in a nonlinear order. In the Nintendo 64 game, the player's progress can only be saved in special portals, while the Microsoft Windows version lets players save the game <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>point.</b> <b>In</b> these portals, the player may also fully restore Turok's health and ammunition once per level.|$|E
5|$|The two {{episodes of}} Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy are side-scrolling {{platform}} video games: {{the majority of}} the game features the player-controlled Commander Keen viewed from the side while moving on a two-dimensional plane. The player can move left and right and can jump, and can use a pogo stick to bounce continuously and jump higher than they can normally with the correct timing. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, viewed from slightly above so as to give a pseudo-3D effect, and some platforms allow Keen to jump up through them from below, while others feature fireman's poles that Keen can climb up or down. Keen can also grab onto the edge of platforms and pull himself up. Once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, though unlike in the first trilogy of episodes, Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, the player can save their game <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>point.</b> <b>In</b> between levels the player travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance or save their progress in the game.
