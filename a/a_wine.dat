5|$|As of December 2007, the TTB lists both Zinfandel and Primitivo as {{approved}} grape varieties for American wines, {{but they are}} not listed as synonyms. U.S. producers, therefore, must label <b>a</b> <b>wine</b> according to whether it is Zinfandel or Primitivo.

25|$|In winemaking, the {{duration}} of maceration or skin contact will influence how much phenolic compounds are leached from skins into the wine. Pigmented tannins, anthocyanins, colloids, tannin-polysaccharides and tannin-proteins not only influence <b>a</b> <b>wine's</b> resulting color but also act as preservatives. During fermentation adjustment to <b>a</b> <b>wine's</b> acid levels {{can be made with}} wines with lower pH having more aging potential. Exposure to oak either during fermentation or after (during barrel aging) will introduce more phenolic compounds to the wines. Prior to bottling, excessive fining or filtering of the wine could strip the wine of some phenolic solids and may lessen <b>a</b> <b>wine's</b> ability to age.|$|R
50|$|Tannins {{help prevent}} oxidation, an {{important}} role in <b>a</b> <b>wine's</b> aging potential. <b>As</b> age-worthy red <b>wines</b> mature, tannin molecules gradually accumulate and precipitate out of the wine in the sediment.|$|R
