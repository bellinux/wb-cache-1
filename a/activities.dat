40|$|Abstract Background The {{benefits}} of regular physical <b>activity</b> for {{quality of life}} and disease prevention have been well documented. Identification of low <b>activity</b> groups would facilitate interventional programs. Many studies have focussed on leisure time <b>activity,</b> which may not capture the spectrum of physical <b>activity</b> relevant to disease prevention. Furthermore, few studies have been conducted in urban Asian settings. Methods We evaluated physical <b>activity</b> in different domains (leisure time, occupational, household and transportation) and its sociodemographic determinants in 4750 adult Chinese, Malay, and Asian Indian Singaporeans. Physical <b>activity</b> was assessed using locally validated questionnaires. Results Occupational and household <b>activity</b> contributed substantially more to total physical <b>activity</b> than leisure time or transportation <b>activity.</b> However, when only <b>activity</b> of at least moderate intensity was considered leisure time <b>activity</b> contributed most to total physical <b>activity.</b> Higher socio-economic status was associated with more leisure time <b>activity,</b> but less total physical <b>activity</b> due to reduced <b>activity</b> in the other domains. Chinese ethnicity was also associated with less total physical <b>activity</b> as a result of less <b>activity</b> in non-leisure time domains. Conclusions In assessing levels of physical <b>activity</b> and recommending changes, {{it is important to consider}} physical <b>activity</b> in different domains. Focus on leisure-time physical <b>activity</b> alone could identify the wrong groups for intervention and miss opportunities for increasing physical <b>activity</b> in populations. </p...|$|R

25|$|Next to evoked <b>activity,</b> neural <b>activity</b> {{related to}} {{stimulus}} processing {{may result in}} induced <b>activity.</b> Induced <b>activity</b> refers to modulation in ongoing brain <b>activity</b> induced by processing of stimuli or movement preparation. Hence, they reflect an indirect response in contrast to evoked responses. A well-studied type of induced <b>activity</b> is amplitude change in oscillatory <b>activity.</b> For instance, gamma <b>activity</b> often increases during increased mental <b>activity</b> such as during object representation. Because induced responses may have different phases across measurements and therefore would cancel out during averaging, they can only be obtained using time-frequency analysis. Induced <b>activity</b> generally reflects the <b>activity</b> of numerous neurons: amplitude changes in oscillatory <b>activity</b> are thought to arise from the synchronization of neural <b>activity,</b> for instance by synchronization of spike timing or membrane potential fluctuations of individual neurons. Increases in oscillatory <b>activity</b> are therefore {{often referred to as}} event-related synchronization, while decreases are referred to as event-related desynchronization.|$|R

Methods: Female adolescents (n = 195; 14 - 18 y) had body mass index (median = 21. 7 [IQR = 5. 2] kg/m(2)) and 4 -site skinfold thickness (median 62. 0 mm; IQR = 37. 1) measured. Physical <b>activity</b> behaviors were measured using the activPAL. Hierarchical cluster analysis grouped participants into <b>activity</b> profiles based on similar physical <b>activity</b> characteristics. Linear mixed models explored differences in body composition across <b>activity</b> profiles. Results: Three <b>activity</b> profiles were identified, a low (n = 35), moderate (n = 110), and a high <b>activity</b> profile (n = 50). Significant differences across <b>activity</b> profiles were observed for skinfold thickness (p =. 046), with higher values observed in the low <b>activity</b> profile compared with the high <b>activity</b> profile. Conclusions: Profiling free-living <b>activity</b> using behaviors from across the <b>activity</b> intensity continuum may account for more of the variability in energy expenditure then examining specific <b>activity</b> intensities, such as MVPA alone. The use of <b>activity</b> profiles may enable the identification of individuals with unhealthy <b>activity</b> behaviors, leading to {{the development and implementation of}} more targeted interventions.
