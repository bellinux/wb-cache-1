5|$|This altercation was {{followed}} by a match between Hardcore Holly and Rhyno. Before the match began, Holly and Rhyno brawled on the entrance ramp, before they entered the ring. Once there, Holly executed a superplex, though, as they recuperated, Rhyno delivered a Gore that caused Holly to roll out of the ring. Afterwards, Holly delivered <b>an</b> <b>Alabama</b> slam for the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|After he {{completed}} 12 of 13 passes, McElroy {{set a new}} single-game Alabama record for completion percentage of 92.3 percent to break the previous record he set against North Texas in 2009. The game also {{marked the first time}} Alabama played on a Thursday night since defeating Southern Miss in 2001, and the return of both former Alabama head coach Bill Curry as the Panthers' head coach and quarterback Star Jackson who transferred to Georgia State prior to the 2010 season. The 63 points were the most scored by <b>an</b> <b>Alabama</b> team since defeating Vanderbilt 63–3 in 1979.|$|E

5|$|Alabama's sole {{success on}} offense {{came from the}} hands of quarterback Andrew Zow, who {{completed}} 19 of 35 passes for 224 yards and a touchdown but also threw three interceptions and fumbled the ball once. Zow's favorite receiver was running back Shaun Alexander, who caught eight passes for 87 yards. Alexander also was Alabama's leading rusher. He finished the game with 21 carries for 55 yards. Zow rushed the ball eight times, but finished with -8 rushing yards. Alexander's eight receptions tied him for third place in receptions during <b>an</b> <b>Alabama</b> bowl game.

5|$|In {{the annual}} Iron Bowl versus rival Auburn, Cody and {{teammate}} Bobby Greenwood sacked quarterback Kodi Burns, giving Cody his first half-sack of the season. He also recovered a fumble, which set up <b>an</b> <b>Alabama</b> touchdown. In the 2008 SEC Championship Game versus Florida, Cody recorded three tackles in a 31–20 loss. In the loss, the Crimson Tide allowed 142yards rushing—the second {{most in the}} 2008 season. In the season finale, he recorded one assisted tackle, while holding the Utah Utes to 13yards rushing. However, Alabama went on to lose the game 31–17, finishing the season 12–2.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} week of play, Vanderbilt beat the Alabama Crimson Tide 14–0 in Birmingham. The score {{reflected}} predictions, since the Commodores were favored by two touchdowns. Jess Neely {{played a role}} in each scoring drive. Early in the first quarter, Vanderbilt had the ball {{in the middle of the}} field after <b>an</b> <b>Alabama</b> punt. Two line bucks preceded Neely, who connected with Tot McCullough for a 30-yard pass play. Neely ran for an additional 17 yards, putting the ball on the nine-yard line. After a run by Godchaux, Lynn Bomar bucked over the line for the touchdown.|$|E
40|$|A {{phylogeny}} {{of the six}} North American {{species in}} the genus Alosa, with representatives of three Eurasian species, was generated using mtDNA sequences. This was accomplished by obtaining sequences for three North American species and additional geographical sampling {{of the other three}} species. The subgenus Alosa, including the formerly recognized subgenus Caspialosa, formed a strongly supported monophyletic group. Alosa alabamae was part of a polytomy with Alosa sapidissima, which was interpreted to support the recognition of <b>A.</b> <b>alabamae</b> as <b>an</b> incipient, yet distinct, species. The subgenus Pomolobus was not recovered as a monophyletic group. Alosa chrysochloris was basal to all other Alosa, although this position was only weakly supported. Previous work had indicated that Alosa pseudoharengus and Alosa aestivalis are not reciprocally monophyletic, but additional sampling in this study did not detect any further cases of shared haplotypes between the two species. The phylogeny supports previous hypotheses that the evolution of North American Alosa species in the Gulf of Mexico (A. chrysochloris and <b>A.</b> <b>alabamae)</b> was the result of two independent events. First, the ancestor of A. chrysochloris was isolated in the Gulf of Mexico, likely by the close of the Suwannee Straits, and this was followed later by dispersal of the ancestor of <b>A.</b> <b>alabamae</b> around the Florida peninsula into the Gulf of Mexico sometime during or after the Pleistocene...|$|R

5|$|Trent Richardson ran for 111 {{yards and}} two touchdowns while Eddie Lacy ran for 85. AJ McCarron threw for 163 yards and a touchdown. For his seven tackles, {{interception}} and fumble recovery, Mark Barron was named SEC Defensive Player of the Week. The 107,846 fans in attendance were the most to ever see <b>an</b> <b>Alabama</b> squad compete on the gridiron, and the victory improved their all-time record against the Nittany Lions to 10–5. The outcome was also noted as the final career loss for Joe Paterno as the Nittany Lions' head coach.|$|E
5|$|After {{a pair of}} Tiger {{possessions}} {{that ended}} with punts and <b>an</b> <b>Alabama</b> possession that ended with a lost fumble by McCarron, the Crimson Tide started their fourth scoring drive of the afternoon. The drive began with a 22-yard McCarron pass to Christion Jones and finished with a 15-yard Yeldon touchdown run. Immediately after Yeldon scored, the referees stopped the game temporarily and cleared the field due to lightning strikes {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the stadium. After a 40-minute stoppage, the game resumed with a Jeremy Shelley extra point and a Crimson Tide lead of 28–0. Missouri responded on the kickoff that ensued with their only touchdown of the afternoon on a 98-yard Marcus Murphy return that made the halftime score 28–7.|$|E

5|$|After the Crimson Tide defense {{held the}} Aggies to a punt, McCarron threw his second {{touchdown}} pass {{of the afternoon}} on the drive that ensued {{early in the second}} quarter on a 44-yard flea flicker pass to DeAndrew White that tied the game 14–14. On the next drive, Cyrus Jones intercepted a Manziel pass in the end zone for a touchback and <b>an</b> <b>Alabama</b> possession. McCarron then threw his third touchdown pass on the game from 51yards to Kenny Bell and gave the Crimson Tide their first lead of the game, 21–14.

5|$|In Alabama's {{first trip}} to Lexington since 2004, and their first road game of the 2009 season, the Tide {{defeated}} the Kentucky Wildcats 38–20. Alabama scored on their opening drive after Javier Arenas returned the opening kickoff 60 yards, which set up an 11-yard Mark Ingram touchdown for an early 7–0 lead. Kentucky responded {{with a pair of}} 49-yard Lones Seiber field goals. The score was 7–6 {{at the end of the}} first quarter. The Tide extended their lead late in the second quarter following a nearly seven-minute, 13-play, 97-yard touchdown drive. Greg McElroy passes of 27 and 21 yards and a 13-yard run by Ingram moved Bama down the field, culminating with a three-yard touchdown pass from McElroy to Colin Peek to put the Tide up 14–6. With only 40 seconds remaining in the half, Kentucky tailback Derrick Locke fumbled the ball after catching a short pass. Courtney Upshaw returned 45 yards for <b>an</b> <b>Alabama</b> touchdown that put the Tide ahead 21–6 at halftime.|$|E

40|$|The {{anadromous}} Alabama shad, Alosa alabamae, has drastically {{declined in}} abundance {{in recent decades}} throughout its historic range and has previously been reported in Arkansas from only five localities. Three of those locality records are pre- 1900. Sampling by seine in the Ouachita River drainage system of southern Arkansas in July and August of 1997 and 1998 produced more than 300 juvenile <b>A.</b> <b>alabamae</b> from two localities on the Little Missouri River and four localities on the Ouachita River. One record of <b>an</b> adult <b>Alabama</b> shad, taken on 4 April 1997 by an angler below Remmel Dam on the Ouachita River, was also documented. Adults apparently ascended the Ouachita River and spawned successfully in 1997 and 1998 despite the construction of four locks and dams on that river in Louisiana and Arkansas in the 1980 s. The Ouachita River drainage and a few streams in east-central Missouri are currently the only known spawning areas for <b>A.</b> <b>alabamae</b> in noncoastal regions of the entire Mississippi River basin. Continued survival of the Alabama shad in Arkansas depends on protecting critical spawning and nursery habitats in the Ouachita River system from deleterious alteration and on preserving that migratory species 2 ̆ 7 access to those habitats...|$|R

5|$|In {{their annual}} rivalry game, Alabama {{defeated}} the LSU Tigers at Tuscaloosa 38–17. After LSU forced <b>an</b> <b>Alabama</b> punt {{on their first}} possession, they proceeded to drive 79-yards to the Crimson Tide three-yard line. On the next play, Tana Patrick forced a J. C. Copeland fumble at the one-yard line that prevented a Tigers' score. The ball was recovered by Landon Collins and gave the Crimson Tide possession at their 10-yard line. After the LSU defense forced a second punt, their offense had their second turnover of the game when a Zach Mettenberger fumble was recovered by Trey DePriest at the Tigers' 27-yard line. Four plays later, Alabama took a 3–0 lead on a 41-yard Cade Foster field goal.|$|E

5|$|Thanks to the missed field goal, Alabama {{began its}} drive at its 25-yard line—the line of {{scrimmage}} for the field goal. In the drive's first play, Zow completed a seven-yard pass to wide receiver Calvin Hall. Alexander then ran {{to the left side}} for a two-yard gain. On third down, Alexander gained three yards and a first down. After that, Moore sacked Zow for a two-yard loss, to the 35-yard line. After the sack, Zow was hit again by the Virginia Tech defense and fumbled the ball. The fumble was scooped up by <b>an</b> <b>Alabama</b> player, however, and resulted in a gain of four yards. Zow then completed a pass to Alexander at the 50-yard line for a first down. Once there, Alabama was twice penalized five yards for false starts on consecutive plays. The penalties ran out the final seconds of the first quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech leading, 70.|$|E
