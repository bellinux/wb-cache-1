5|$|After {{delivery}} of the barium-lanthanum material to Los Alamos, it was stored in a dedicated building in the Bayo Canyon Site. At first, the mixture was used as-is, both barium and lanthanum together, but this led to unpleasant radioactive contamination that took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> disappear as the half-life of barium-140 is 12.5 days. Shortly after, the process was improved; barium was removed chemically, by double precipitation from a solution as barium sulfate.|$|E

5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{may choose}} to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or probes rather than by radio, for various reasons. While probes may take <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> reach the Solar System, once there {{they would be able}} to hold a sustained dialogue that would be impossible using radio from hundreds or thousands of light-years away. Radio would be completely unsuitable for surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization, and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, artifacts may be the only option other than to send large, crewed spacecraft to the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Saman was {{released}} in 1998 after winning the 1997 Jakarta Art Institute novel writing contest. In 1998, Saman won the Jakarta Arts Council Novel Competition. In 2000, it received the Prince Claus Award. By 2005, it had been translated into Dutch and English; the English translation took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> write because Utami was concerned that an overexplanation of the novel caused it to lose all of its sensuality. It has also been translated into French, Czech, and Japanese (by two separate translators). , a translation into Korean is underway. By 2004, the book had sold 100,000 copies, a large figure for an Indonesian novel.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia was {{regarded}} as an ideal location for air training {{for a number of}} reasons. It was far from the hostilities, firmly pro-British and had excellent weather throughout the year. The British Air Ministry resolved to outsource training to the colony amid some urgency in late 1939 after EATS took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> get going in Canada. The RATG was the last EATS group to be formed, but the first to start training airmen; it also turned out fully qualified pilots before any of the others, doing so {{for the first time in}} November 1940.|$|E

5|$|The {{wood turtle}} takes <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> reach sexual maturity, {{has a low}} {{fecundity}} (ability to reproduce), but has a high adult survival rate. However, the high survival rates are not true of juveniles or hatchlings. Although males establish hierarchies, they are not territorial. The wood turtle becomes sexually mature between 14 and 18 years of age. Mating activity among wood turtles peaks {{in the spring and}} again in the fall, although it is known to mate throughout the portion of the year they are active. However, it has been observed mating in December. In one rare instance, a female wood turtle hybridized with a male Blanding's turtle.|$|E
5|$|Vandersteen, liberated of {{the work}} on the daily comic, started on a comic series based on one of the novels he had read as a youth: Robert en Bertrand, the story of two Flemish tramps at the fin de siècle. The series debuted in De Standaard in 1972. The series was the first in <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> renew the enthusiasm of Vandersteen, and the {{graphical}} quality and the stories were a lot better than most of the Studio production of the time.|$|E
5|$|Albatross chicks take <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> fledge. In {{the case}} of the great albatrosses, it can take up to 280 days; even for the smaller albatrosses, it takes {{anywhere}} between 140 and 170 days. Like many seabirds, albatross chicks will gain enough weight to be heavier than their parents, and prior to fledging they use these reserves to build up body condition (particularly growing all their flight feathers), usually fledging at the same weight as their parents. Between 15% and 65% of those fledged survive to breed. Albatross chicks fledge on their own and receive no further help from their parents, who return to the nest after fledging, unaware their chick has left. Studies of juveniles dispersing at sea have suggested an innate migration behaviour, a genetically coded navigation route, which helps young birds when they are first out at sea.|$|E

5|$|Mona had booked the Les Stewart Quartet to {{play the}} opening night with Harrison on guitar, but they {{cancelled}} the booking after Stewart and Brown had a quarrel. Stewart was angry that Brown had missed a rehearsal, because Brown was helping Mona to decorate the club. As 300 membership cards had already been sold, Harrison {{said that he had}} two friends in a band called The Quarrymen who would play instead. Lennon, McCartney, Stuart Sutcliffe and Harrison went to the club to arrange the booking, to which Mona agreed, but said she needed to finish painting the club first. All four took up brushes and helped Mona to finish painting the walls with spiders, dragons, rainbows, stars, and a beetle, which still survive. John Lennon was short-sighted, mistaking gloss for emulsion paint, which took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> dry in the dark, damp cellar. Cynthia Powell, later the wife of Lennon, painted a silhouette of John Lennon on the wall, which is also still intact.|$|E
5|$|The Corporal had {{numerous}} limitations. It took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> set up, {{so it could}} not engage targets of opportunity; there could be delays in the countdown process, which {{made it hard to}} warn the troops to close their eyes or aircraft to avoid the area; and it was guided by a radio beam that not only could be jammed, but could actually be diverted. Moreover, during test firings in the Outer Hebrides, although eight out of twelve missiles accurately hit their targets, four fell short, which is always regrettable but particularly so when nuclear weapons are involved in view of the danger it posed to one's own troops. A new British project was therefore launched to develop a better missile, codenamed Blue Water, which was to have used the British Indigo Hammer and later the Tony warhead.|$|E
5|$|The Melbourne Club {{decided that}} the team should wear red, white and blue colours on their {{clothing}} for the game. Although they had <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> prepare, the MCC had some difficulty in assembling enough men to represent Port Phillip; many potential players were unable to spare the time to travel to Van Diemen's Land. Even as the team prepared to depart, only ten people had been found, and the eleventh, Duncan Cooper, only joined as they left on the steamer Shamrock. The eleven Victorian players, accompanied by many acquaintances, both men and women, arrived in Launceston on 9 February. On the evening of their arrival, they attended a dinner at the Cornwall Hotel with 100 paying guests. The following day, the team won a match against Bishopthorpe College. There was little time to practise before the intercolonial game.|$|E

5|$|The SSEM had a 32-bit {{word length}} and {{a memory of}} 32words (1 kilobit). As it was {{designed}} to be the simplest possible stored-program computer, the only arithmetic operations implemented in hardware were subtraction and negation; other arithmetic operations were implemented in software. The first of three programs written for the machine found the highest proper divisor of 218 (262,144), a calculation that was known would take <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> run—and so prove the computer's reliability—by testing every integer from 218−1 downwards, as division was implemented by repeated subtraction of the divisor. The program consisted of 17instructions and ran for 52minutes before reaching the correct answer of 131,072, after the SSEM had performed 3.5million operations (for an effective CPU speed of 1.1 kIPS).|$|E
5|$|The park's woods are {{important}} because they provide shelter for {{a large number of}} animals. They are a natural defence against landslides, avalanches, and flooding. The two main types of woods found in the park are coniferous and deciduous woods. The deciduous European beech forests are common on the Piedmont side of the park, and are not found on the dryer Valle d'Aosta side. These forests are thick with dense foliage that lets in very little light during the summer. The beech leaves take <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> decompose, and they form a thick layer on the woodland floor that impedes the development of other plants and trees. Larches are the most common trees in the forests on the valley floors. They are mixed with spruces, Swiss stone pines, and more rarely silver firs.|$|E
5|$|The {{writers of}} The Simpsons {{went on strike}} {{together}} with the Writers Guild of America {{at the end of}} 2007. The broadcasting of The Simpsons was not affected by the strike. Since it takes <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> produce an episode of an animated show, the episodes are written up to a year in advance. So the strike would have had to go on for a while for the show to have run out of new episodes. Production of season 20 was further delayed because of contract negotiations with the six main voice actors. The dispute was resolved, and the actors' salary was raised to $400,000 per episode. The delay in production has caused the planned 22 episodes to be shortened to 20.|$|E

5|$|Another {{difficult}} area was feats. Although common feats worked well, with a random {{chance of success}} or failure, uncommon ones would appear to fail more often. To avoid this, randomization {{was replaced by a}} degree of difficulty in accomplishing the feat. Although pen-and-paper falling damage is random, the computer game bases damage on the distance of the fall. The team's biggest challenge was adapting disciplines. The pen-and-paper version may require a little blood that requires <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> use, or have no blood cost and can be used at will; upgraded disciplines had additional requirements considered too confusing for a computer game. Troika attempted to equalize the disciplines, keeping the effect intact and normalizing the cost, so a first-level power requires one blood point, a second-level two points and so on. To balance the clans, the aristocratic Ventrue were only allowed to feed on noble blood, though this was changed to allow them to feed on lower-class humans, receiving less blood. During character creation, the game had an optional character biography with unique positive and negative characteristics (increasing one ability while limiting another). This was removed from the released game; Activision felt that there was insufficient test time, and removing it was a more stable option.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{music in}} North Georgia, including {{what is now}} Athens, {{was that of the}} Native Americans of the area, principally the Creek and the Cherokee. Athens was officially chartered in 1806, and began growing rapidly near the middle of the 19th century. By the time of the American Civil War in the 1860s, the city was an important part of musical life in Georgia. The war accelerated the development of the city's musical importance, as Athens was largely spared widespread destruction while the larger city of Atlanta took <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> recover. Major touring acts like the Dixie Family and The Slomans visited Athens during the war; the Dixie Family, a prominent touring group, performed disastrously, according to local newspapers, who said that the highlight of the performance came from four local African American musicians, and the Dixie Family had absconded with the concert's proceeds, which had been promised to the local Ladies Aid Society. In the 1870s, the city was almost half African American, and local black-owned industry flourished; among the residents was Bob Cole, born in 1868 to a musically active family. Cole would later become a pioneer in African American theater, known for works like the 1898 musical A Trip to Coontown.|$|E
