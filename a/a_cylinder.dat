5|$|After {{the tests}} have been satisfactorily completed, <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> passing the test will be marked accordingly. Stamp marking {{will include the}} {{registered}} mark of the inspection facility and the date of testing (month and year). Records of a periodic inspection and test are made by the test station and kept available for inspection. These include: If <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> fails inspection or testing and cannot be recovered, the owner must be notified before making the empty cylinder unserviceable.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> {{differential}} <b>cylinder</b> {{acts like}} <b>a</b> normal <b>cylinder</b> when pulling. If the cylinder however has to push, the {{oil from the}} piston rod side of the cylinder is not returned to the reservoir, but goes to the bottom side of the <b>cylinder.</b> In such <b>a</b> way, the <b>cylinder</b> goes much faster, but the maximum force the cylinder can give is like <b>a</b> plunger <b>cylinder.</b> <b>A</b> differential <b>cylinder</b> can be manufactured like <b>a</b> normal <b>cylinder,</b> and only <b>a</b> special control is added.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> {{hydraulic}} <b>cylinder</b> without <b>a</b> piston {{or with a}} piston without seals {{is called}} <b>a</b> plunger <b>cylinder.</b> <b>A</b> plunger <b>cylinder</b> can only {{be used as a}} pushing cylinder; the maximum force is piston rod area multiplied by pressure. This means that <b>a</b> plunger <b>cylinder</b> in general has a relatively thick piston rod.|$|R
50|$|When {{containing}} six <b>cylinders,</b> <b>a</b> VR-engine's <b>cylinder</b> block {{consists of}} two cylinder banks (left: 1-3-5; right: 2-4-6) while there is only <b>a</b> single <b>cylinder</b> head covering both rows of cylinders.|$|R
5|$|A beer {{tower is}} a beer {{dispensing}} device, usually found in bars and pubs, {{that consists of}} <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> attached to a beer cooling device at the bottom. Beer is dispensed from the beer tower into a drinking vessel.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>cylinder</b> handle may be fitted, usually clamped to the neck, to {{conveniently}} {{carry the}} cylinder. This can {{also increase the}} risk of snagging in an enclosed environment.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} feature of anti-de Sitter space is its boundary (which looks like <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{in the case of}} three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space). One property of this boundary is that, locally around any point, it looks just like Minkowski space, the model of spacetime used in nongravitational physics.|$|E

30|$|The {{study of}} fluid flow past a {{cylindrical}} geometry {{was performed by}} among others Anwa et al. [13], who studied mixed convection boundary layer flow of a viscoelastic fluid over <b>a</b> horizontal <b>cylinder.</b> Deka et al. [14] investigated transient free convection flow past <b>an</b> accelerated vertical <b>cylinder</b> in <b>a</b> rotating <b>cylinder.</b> Ribeiro et al. [15] studied viscoelastic flow past <b>a</b> confined <b>cylinder</b> with three dimensional effects and stability. Patel and Chhabra [16] studied steady flow of Bingham plastic fluids past <b>an</b> elliptical <b>cylinder.</b>|$|R
25|$|Bailout gas for a {{back-mounted}} configuration may {{be carried}} {{in a variety of}} ways in <b>a</b> bailout <b>cylinder.</b> The most popular being as <b>a</b> sling <b>cylinder,</b> <b>a</b> pony <b>cylinder</b> strapped to the primary back mounted <b>cylinder,</b> or in <b>a</b> small <b>cylinder</b> (Spare air) supported by a pocket attached to the buoyancy compensator. When more than one cylinder of the same mix are side-mounted, the cylinders not in use function as bailout sets, provided they contain enough gas to get the diver safely to the surface.|$|R
5|$|From 1889 to 1960, {{the meter}} {{was defined as}} the length of a platinum-iridium (90:10) alloy bar, known as the International Prototype Meter bar. The {{previous}} bar was made of platinum in 1799. The International Prototype Kilogram remains defined by <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> of the same platinum-iridium alloy made in 1879.|$|E
5|$|If <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{passes the}} listed procedures, but the {{condition}} remains doubtful, further tests {{can be applied}} to ensure that the cylinder is fit for use. Cylinders that fail the tests or inspection and cannot be fixed should be rendered unserviceable after notifying the owner of the reason for failure.|$|E
5|$|Prolate: This is an {{icosahedron}} elongated {{along the}} fivefold axis {{and is a}} common arrangement of the heads of bacteriophages. This structure is composed of <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> with a cap at either end.|$|E
40|$|An exact {{calculation}} of electromagnetic scattering from a perfectly conducting parabolic cylinder is employed to compute Casimir forces in several configurations. These include interactions between <b>a</b> parabolic <b>cylinder</b> and <b>a</b> plane, two parabolic <b>cylinders,</b> and <b>a</b> parabolic <b>cylinder</b> and <b>an</b> ordinary <b>cylinder.</b> To elucidate {{the effect of}} boundaries, special {{attention is focused on}} the "knife-edge" limit in which the parabolic <b>cylinder</b> becomes <b>a</b> half-plane. Geometrical effects are illustrated by considering arbitrary rotations of <b>a</b> parabolic <b>cylinder</b> around its focal axis, and arbitrary translations perpendicular to this axis. A quite different geometrical arrangement is explored for the case of <b>an</b> ordinary <b>cylinder</b> placed in the interior of <b>a</b> parabolic <b>cylinder.</b> All of these results extend simply to nonzero temperatures.

5|$|The {{functional}} diving cylinder {{consists of}} a pressure vessel and <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> valve. There are usually one or more optional accessories depending on the specific application.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>{{cylinder}}</b> boot is a {{hard rubber}} or plastic cover which fits over {{the base of a}} diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder, {{and in the case of}} round bottomed cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder, and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.|$|E

40|$|The field {{feedback}} formulation {{is applied}} to the solution of time-harmonic plane wave scattering by 2 -D penetrable objects of arbitrary shape and composition. A conformal mesh, finite element algorithm is employed in the forward operator construction while a near-field Green’s function integration is used in forming the feedback operator. Scattering validations for midresonance sized objects include <b>a</b> circular <b>cylinder,</b> <b>a</b> two-region bisected <b>cylinder,</b> <b>a</b> half-circular <b>cylinder,</b> <b>a</b> semicircular shell and a thin lossy planar strip.

5|$|Archimedes {{died during}} the Siege of Syracuse {{when he was killed}} by a Roman soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed. Cicero {{describes}} visiting the tomb of Archimedes, which was surmounted by a sphere and <b>a</b> <b>cylinder,</b> which Archimedes had requested to be placed on his tomb, representing his mathematical discoveries.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick dropped all {{his other}} {{responsibilities}} {{to concentrate on}} proving {{the existence of the}} neutron, assisted by Feather and frequently working late at night. He devised a simple apparatus that consisted of <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> containing a polonium source and beryllium target. The resulting radiation could then be directed at a material such as paraffin wax; the displaced particles, which were protons, would go into a small ionisation chamber where they could be detected with an oscilloscope.|$|E
5|$|Rowland (2009) {{identified}} {{an additional}} mechanism of countershading not previously analysed, namely that a round body like <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> illuminated and seen from above {{appears to have}} dark sides. Using a graphics tool, she demonstrated that this effect can be flattened out by countershading. Since predators are known to use edges to identify prey, countershading may therefore, she argues, make prey harder to detect when seen from above.|$|E
40|$|A 4 * 4 {{transfer}} matrix is derived {{to evaluate the}} response of a multi-layered infinitely long elastic <b>cylinder</b> imbedded in <b>a</b> fluid and enclosing another fluid, to a given one-dimensional pressure excitation, or alternatively to evaluate the acoustic pressure distribution excited by the radial velocity component of the radiating surface. It is shown that the {{transfer matrix}} can be effectively used to obtain the scattering coefficient and noise reductiion of <b>a</b> multi-layered <b>cylinder</b> for the case of normal incidence of a plane wave. Expressions for several particular cases, such as monostatic back scattering, scattering from <b>a</b> rigid <b>cylinder</b> and <b>a</b> soft <b>cylinder,</b> <b>a</b> solid and <b>a</b> fluid <b>cylinder,</b> are presented. It is shown analytically that the expressions for scattering coefficient for the general case of <b>a</b> hollow <b>cylinder</b> and the particular cases of <b>a</b> fluid <b>cylinder</b> and <b>a</b> solid <b>cylinder</b> lead to the same expressions obtained by using a normal mode solution. Numerical results for the scattering form function and noise reduction of <b>a</b> two-layer infinite <b>cylinder</b> are given to illustrate the effect of layer material characteristics, variation of thickness of either of the constituent layers, cylinder dimensions, and ambient media. Finally, a four-layer hose has been analyzed in order to demonstrate the computational advantage of the transfer matrix method...|$|R
5|$|The {{thickness}} of the cylinder walls {{is directly related to}} the working pressure, and this affects the buoyancy characteristics of the <b>cylinder.</b> <b>A</b> low-pressure <b>cylinder</b> will be more buoyant than <b>a</b> high-pressure <b>cylinder</b> with similar size and proportions of length to diameter and in the same alloy.|$|R

5|$|The new European Norm EN144-3:2003 {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} valve, similar to existing 232 bar or 300 bar DIN valves, however, with a metric M26×2 fitting on both the cylinder and the regulator. These are intended to be used for breathing gas with oxygen content above that normally found in natural air in the Earth's atmosphere (i.e. 22–100%). From August 2008, these were required in the European Union for all diving equipment used with nitrox or pure oxygen. The idea behind this new standard is to prevent a rich mixture being filled to <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> that is not oxygen clean. However even with use of the new system there still remains nothing except human procedural care to ensure that <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> with a new valve remains oxygen-clean - which is exactly how the previous system worked.|$|E
5|$|The {{nominal volume}} of gas stored is {{commonly}} quoted as the cylinder {{capacity in the}} USA. It {{is a measure of}} the volume of gas that can be released from the full cylinder at atmospheric pressure. Terms used for the capacity include 'free gas volume' or 'free gas equivalent'. It depends on the internal volume and the working pressure of <b>a</b> <b>cylinder.</b> If the working pressure is higher, the cylinder will store more gas for the same volume.|$|E
5|$|A {{prototype}} for the Kinetoscope {{was shown to}} a convention of the National Federation of Women's Clubs on May 20, 1891. The first public demonstration of the Kinetoscope {{was held at the}} Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. Instrumental to the birth of American movie culture, the Kinetoscope also had a major impact in Europe; its influence abroad was magnified by Edison's decision not to seek international patents on the device, facilitating numerous imitations of and improvements on the technology. In 1895, Edison introduced the Kinetophone, which joined the Kinetoscope with <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> phonograph. Film projection, which Edison initially disdained as financially nonviable, soon superseded the Kinetoscope's individual exhibition model. Many of the projection systems developed by Edison's firm in later years would use the Kinetoscope name.|$|E

A vertical inverted engine is defined as <b>a</b> vertical <b>cylinder</b> arrangement, with the crankshaft mounted directly below the <b>cylinder(s).</b> With <b>an</b> inclined or horizontal type, the cylinder and piston are positioned at an incline or horizontally. An inclined inverted <b>cylinder</b> is <b>an</b> inverted <b>cylinder</b> operating at <b>an</b> incline. These terms are all generally used in conjunction with the engine types above.
