Contemporary neurologist Guillaume-Benjamin-Amand Duchenne de Boulogne [...] also {{claimed to have}} described the condition 1 year earlier, although the written report was never found. The condition has been called progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), <b>Aran-Duchenne</b> <b>disease,</b> Duchenne-Aran disease, Aran-Duchenne muscular atrophy, and Duchenne-Aran muscular atrophy. The name [...] "spinal muscular atrophy" [...] is ambiguous as it refers to any of various spinal muscular atrophies, including the autosomal recessive spinal muscular atrophy caused by a genetic defect in the SMN1 gene.|$|E
