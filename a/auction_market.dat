40|$|Buyers {{and sellers}} of {{livestock}} come together at livestock <b>auction</b> <b>markets</b> to discover prices {{in a public}} setting. Livestock markets may differentiate themselves by offering electronic individual animal identification and tracking services to their customers. Programs such as the National Animal Identification System (NAIS), marketing alliances, and verification programs are leading to an increased use of animal identification systems. Livestock markets are a primary industry sector where animal movement and identification information can be recorded. This project’s purpose was to determine livestock market manager perceptions about animal identification systems, estimate costs of adopting animal tracking systems in <b>auction</b> <b>markets,</b> and assess factors related to adoption of animal ID systems in <b>auction</b> <b>markets.</b> To accomplish these objectives, {{a national survey of}} livestock <b>auction</b> <b>markets</b> was conducted in the winter of 2006.

Until 2007, the record at auction for an indigenous art work was $778,750 paid in 2003 for a Rover Thomas painting, All That Big Rain Coming from the Top Side. In 2007, a major work by Emily Kngwarreye, Earth's Creation, sold for $1.056 million, a new record that was however eclipsed {{only a few months}} later, when Clifford Possum's epic work Warlugulong was bought for $2.4 million by the National Gallery of Australia. At the same time, however, works by prominent artists but of doubtful provenance were being passed in at auctions. In 2003 there were 97 indigenous Australian artists whose works were being sold at auction in Australia for prices above $5000, with the total <b>auction</b> <b>market</b> worth around $9.5 million. In that year Sotheby's estimated that half of sales were to bidders outside Australia. By 2012, the market had changed, with older works fetching higher prices than contemporary paintings.|$|E

25|$|The NYSE {{trades in}} a {{continuous}} auction format, where traders can execute stock transactions on behalf of investors. They will gather around the appropriate post where a specialist broker, who is employed by a NYSE member firm (that is, he/she is not {{an employee of the}} New York Stock Exchange), acts as an auctioneer in an open outcry <b>auction</b> <b>market</b> environment to bring buyers and sellers together and to manage the actual auction. They do on occasion (approximately 10% of the time) facilitate the trades by committing their own capital {{and as a matter of}} course disseminate information to the crowd that helps to bring buyers and sellers together. The auction process moved toward automation in 1995 through the use of wireless hand held computers (HHC). The system enabled traders to receive and execute orders electronically via wireless transmission. On September 25, 1995, NYSE member Michael Einersen, who designed and developed this system, executed 1000 shares of IBM through this HHC ending a 203-year process of paper transactions and ushering in an era of automated trading.|$|E

500|$|The {{number of}} Thoroughbred foals {{registered}} {{each year in}} North America varies greatly, chiefly linked {{to the success of}} the <b>auction</b> <b>market</b> which in turn depends on the state of the economy. The foal crop was over 44,000 in 1990, but declined to roughly 22,500 by 2014. The largest numbers are registered in the states of Kentucky, Florida and California. [...] Australia is the second largest producer of Thoroughbreds in the world with almost 30,000broodmares producing about 18,250foals annually. [...] Britain produces about 5,000 foals a year, and worldwide, there are more than 195,000active broodmares, or females being used for breeding, and 118,000newly registered foals in 2006 alone. The Thoroughbred industry is a large agribusiness, generating around $34billion in revenue annually in the United States and providing about 470,000jobs through a network of farms, training centers and race tracks.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we analyse factors {{relevant}} for adopting multi-access technologies in online <b>auction</b> <b>markets.</b> Its focus is on how multi-access technologies, such as Web and Internet technologies, mobile and wireless technologies, and digital TV technologies are adopted in online consumer <b>auction</b> <b>markets.</b> From a literature review four factors were identified based on theories of online <b>auction</b> <b>markets,</b> channels in marketing and logistics, and communication channels and media features that could explain the adoption of multi-access technologies. The four factors are: perceived appropriateness of a given multi-access technology, media richness of various multi-access technologies, support of multiple modes of communication relationships, {{and the level of}} experience in using multiple marketing channels. We analysed five Finnish consumer auction markets: Huuto. Net, Keltainen Pörssi, QXL Finland, Systeemi. Net, and Tori. Our analysis of five Finnish online auctions shows that the Internet and World Wide Web are the predominant [...] and in most cases the only [...] online access technology available to the users. Furthermore, not even the Web-technologies are used to their full potential.

40|$|The {{scenario}} of established business sellers utilizing online <b>auction</b> <b>markets</b> to reach consumers and sell new products {{is becoming increasingly}} common. We propose a class of risk management tools, loosely based {{on the concept of}} financial options that can be employed by such sellers. While conceptually similar to options in financial markets, we empirically demonstrate that option instruments within <b>auction</b> <b>markets</b> cannot be developed employing similar methodologies, because the fundamental tenets of extant option pricing models do not hold within online <b>auction</b> <b>markets.</b> We provide a framework to analyze the value proposition of options to potential sellers, option-holder behavior implications on auction processes, and seller strategies to write and price options that maximize potential revenues. We then develop an approach that enables a seller to assess the demand for options under different option price and volume scenarios. We compare option prices derived from our approach with those derived from the Black-Scholes model (Black & Scholes, 1973) and discuss the implications of the price differences. Experiments based on actual auction data suggest that options can provide significan...|$|R
