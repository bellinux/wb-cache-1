2500|$|The hollow [...] "square" [...] had again progressed {{several hundred}} yards beyond the {{flanking}} batteries, but Cumberland had become increasingly isolated in the centre with his shrinking mass of British and Hanoverian infantry. The allies grew indecisive. Löwendahl saw the true state of affairs, and galloped off to meet with Saxe. [...] "Well, monsieur le maréchal, here is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>day</b> <b>for</b> his Majesty. These fellows will never get themselves out of a fix like that." [...] After a council with Louis XV it was resolved to unite all available forces, and at around 2:00pm, Saxe made a final concerted effort to repulse the enemy. Four pieces of reserve artillery, loaded with grape-shot, were brought into action, and every available regiment mustered. Saxe rallied six Irish battalions of the [...] "Wild Geese" [...] supported by the remnants of Vaisseaux and Normandie for a final assault and flung themselves into the attack with the wild Gaelic cry of [...] "Cuimhnigidh ar Luimnech agus feall na Sassonach!" [...] – [...] "Remember Limerick and Saxon Perfidy". The Irish Brigade, as a brigade, would suffer the heaviest overall casualties on the French side, losing 656 men including one-quarter of their officers. Sergeant Wheelock of Bulkeley captured a colour and the attack of the Irish compelled the British Guards to retire. A simultaneous attack on the allied left was made by all the regiments which had faced the Dutch between Fontenoy and Antoing. Meanwhile, the French Guards, now led by the Comte de Chabannes, eager for revenge, with fixed bayonets charged the front so closely that fire was exchanged muzzle to muzzle. As Saxe and Löwendahl led the infantry, D'Estrées, and Richelieu brought up the whole Household Cavalry. The fighting was extremely close and deadly, some British regiments lost half their strength such as the Royal Welch Fusiliers which lost 322 soldiers, over 200 killed, while the brigade of British Guards suffered over 700 casualties. The French counter-attacks eventually halted and then repelled the British column, taking the field.|$|E

60|$|Sunday is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>day</b> with us, <b>for</b> {{then the}} shore {{is lined with}} Parisians, as {{thoroughly}} cockney as if Bow-bells could {{be heard in the}} Quartier Montmartre! These good people visit us, in all sorts of ways; some on donkeys, some in cabriolets, some in fiacres, and by far the larger portion on foot. They are perfectly inoffensive and unobtrusive, being, in this respect, just as unlike an American inroad from a town as can well be. These crowds pass vineyards on their way to us, unprotected by any fences. This point in the French character, however, about which so much has been said to our disadvantage, as well as to that of the English, is subject to some explanation. The statues, promenades, gardens, etc. etc. are, almost without exception, guarded by sentinels; and then there are agents of the police, in common clothes, scattered through the towns, in such numbers as to make depredations hazardous. In the country each commune has one, or more, gardes champêtres, whose sole business it is to detect and arrest trespassers. When to these are added the gendarmes à pied and à cheval, who are constantly in motion, one sees that the risk of breaking the laws is attended with more hazard here than with us. There is no doubt, on the other hand, that the training and habits, produced by such a system of watchfulness, enter so far into the character of the people, that they cease to think of doing that which is so strenuously denied them.|$|R

You may sit on my back, and then I can carry you there." [...] So she seated herself on his back, and they did go so swiftly! When they got there, the East Wind went in and said that the girl whom he had brought was the one who ought to have had the Prince up at the castle which lay east of the sun and west of the moon, and that now she was traveling about to find him again, so he had come there with her, and would like to hear if the West Wind knew whereabout the castle was. [...] "No," [...] said the West Wind; [...] "so far as that have I never blown; but if you like I will go with you to the South Wind, for he is much stronger than either of us, and he has roamed far and wide, and perhaps he can tell you what you want to know.

50|$|At {{a meeting}} held on 3 December 1928, {{it was decided}} to form a golf club {{to be known as the}} Laidley Golf Club. The Club held its Opening Day on Sunday 9 December 1928 on {{fourteen}} holes prepared at the Show Grounds. The best round of the day being 94. In April 1930 they had enough money to purchase sand and Dr Sweeney, the President, used reaping hook and lawn mower on the course and R E Allen & R A Ditton leveled the greens and spread sand. At the Annual Meeting held in March 1931, Mr. Watkins was congratulated on being the Club's first Club Champion and the holder of the course record of 72 for eighteen holes. The 1931 season was played on much improved links, but it was becoming increasingly evident that this ground was not suited for a golf course because of its limited area - about nine acres. In November 1931 {{it was decided to}} abandon the showgrounds and establish new links on the Recreation Reserve which was about forty acres in area, not more than 200 yards from the business area of the main street. The work of laying out the new links proceeded and full use was made of a gully which ran right through the reserve, providing a natural hazard for six holes. As the ground was perfectly level, the new links were <b>a</b> <b>great</b> improvement. Opening <b>Day</b> <b>for</b> these new links was held on Saturday 16 April 1932. In 1934 the first Associates Championship was won by Mrs. M.G. Watkin. In August 1935, R A Ditton, of Laidley, scooped the pool of golf events at Royal Queensland, winning the Country championship with a total of 168, the Royal Queensland Cup with an aggregate of 142, and tying in a Country Week handicap. He won by four shots over D. Von Nida. In 1938 it was decided to hold the Club's first Open Day on 23 October- this Open Day was to become an Annual Event.|$|R
