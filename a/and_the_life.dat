5|$|Kannada {{became more}} {{prominent}} {{as a literary}} language during the Rashtrakuta rule with its script and literature showing remarkable growth, dignity and productivity.

5|$|After {{handing over}} the {{earrings}} and taking leave of his guru, Uttanka went to Hastinapur, {{the kingdom of}} King Janamejaya. He resolved to teach a lesson to Takshaka who had caused him trouble. He informed Janamejaya that it was Takshaka who had killed his father Parikshit and advised Janamejaya to perform a snake sacrifice to exterminate the serpents. Uttanka {{was one of the}} rishis who participated in the Sarpa Satra yagna initiated by the king. Sarpa Satra was meant to draw all serpents to the sacrificial fire to certain death by the chanting of mantras. After the serpents started falling into the sacrificial fire, Takshaka was not to be found anywhere. Uttanka then recited the mantras with great vigour to draw Takshaka to the fire. In mortal fear, Taskshaka took shelter with Indra and got himself tied to the throne of Indra for protection. Uttanka, who realised that Takshaka had taken refuge with Indra, intensified his mantras to ensure that not only Takshaka but also Indra along with his throne were drawn to the fire. Indra freed the snake from the throne and escaped. However, when Takshaka was about to drop to death into the sacrificial fire, Astika, a young boy well versed in scriptures, son of the sage Jaratkaru intervened with Janamejaya. Astika ensured that the Sarpa Satra was stopped <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> of Takshaka was saved.|$|E
5|$|Ancient lore {{states that}} Vana'diel was {{created as a}} {{playground}} for the Gods and their children, who themselves were spawned from an enormous and sentient Crystal. Eventually wishing to be one with the Gods, the children constructed a pathway to paradise. They were smote down for their insolence, however, and their cities cast {{to the bottom of}} the sea. After seeing the destruction of her children and filled with sadness, the Goddess Altana wept five tears that gave life to the five Enlightened Races of Vana'diel. The God of Twilight, Promathia, condemned her weakness, however, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> that arose from it. Promathia cursed the five races with eternal conflict amongst themselves by bringing forth their darkest attributes: the apathy of the Humes, the arrogance of the Elvaan, the rage of the Galka, the cowardice of the Tarutaru, and the envy of the Mithra. He created the Beastmen, commanding them to forever fight the people of Vana'diel and occupy their minds, so these children would never have time to group together and construct a pathway like the ones before them. The creation lore's sentient Crystal, Gods, Children, and the truths behind them feature as major plot points in several Final Fantasy XI expansion packs, while the Beastmen are some of the game's main antagonists.|$|E
5|$|As {{a natural}} side-effect {{of the size}} of the fuel {{elements}} and their resulting explosions, ICF designs use a very large reaction chamber many meters across. This lowers the neutron flux on any particular part of the chamber wall through the inverse square law. Additionally, there are no magnets or other complex systems near or inside the reactor, and the laser is isolated on the far side of long optical paths. The far side of the chamber is empty, allowing the blanket to be placed there and easily maintained. Although the reaction chamber walls and final optics would eventually embrittle and require replacement, the chamber is essentially a large steel ball of relatively simple multi-piece construction that could be replaced without too much effort. The reaction chamber is, on the whole, dramatically simpler than those in magnetic fusion concepts, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>LIFE</b> designs proposed building several and quickly moving them in and out of production.|$|E

5|$|En {{route to}} a weekend getaway, {{surgeons}} Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) and Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) {{are involved in a}} vehicular collision, moments after Robbins proposes marriage. Torres suffers severe injuries, which endanger both her life <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> of her unborn child. She and Robbins are taken to Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, the institute at which they both work. Their colleagues attempt to save Torres, while Robbins and Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), the father of Torres's baby, stand by. Torres's many injuries include neurological trauma. While barely conscious, she hallucinates an uninjured version of herself standing beside her. The hallucinatory Torres begins to sing, and is gradually joined by the doctors treating her. This singing continues throughout the episode, as Torres's projection of herself attempts to reach out to Robbins.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore, the Penal Code {{lays out}} {{sanctions}} for non-compliance with the Termination of Pregnancy Act, which limits abortion {{to women who}} have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. By not conferring the right to life upon fetuses younger than the stipulated period, the legislation has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expectant mothers who are threatened by their unborn children. This is in contrast with the approach taken in the Philippines, where the Constitution provides that the state shall equally protect {{the life of the mother}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> of the unborn from conception. Similarly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms of the Czech Republic states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. Chances of a universal consensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to his defiance of society in matters of his own relationships, Carleton is tasked with supervising his niece Lucilla. He must ensure {{that she is not}} drawn into a scandal, ruining her prospects of marriage, a role Heyer often gives to her heroes. It is rare that her heroines are given the same responsibility, but in this novel Annis chooses to become involved in shepherding Lucilla through society. Like the hero, the heroine ignores the standards of propriety when she chooses, yet also shelters Lucilla from following her example, as Annis thinks the younger woman lacks the experience to properly judge when it is appropriate to disregard society's mores. Annis's age, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> experience she has gained, give her a greater ability to manipulate the social standards of her time than a young ingenue. As in Heyer's other novels, her word choice frequently highlights the fact that the heroine's behavior diverges from the socially accepted feminine ideal of the Regency period. Rather than repel others, the unwillingness to conform to the expected behavioural norms endears the heroine to the hero.|$|E
