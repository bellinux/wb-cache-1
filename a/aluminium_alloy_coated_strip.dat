Factorial experimental design technique was used to investigate and select the parameter combination to achieve a coating with adequate strength and ductility. Spindle speed, axial force and table traverse speed were observed to be the most significant factors on physical dimensions. It was observed that the thickness of the coating decreased as the coating width increased. In addition, the width and thickness of the coatings are higher at low and high torques. At intermediate torque values, when the force is high, the width of the coating is high, and its thickness is thin; and when the force is low, the width and thickness are low. The interaction effect between axial force (F) – table traverse speed (Vx) and spindle speed (N) – table traverse speed (Vx) produced an increasing effect on coating width and thickness, but other interactions exhibited decreasing influence. It has also been observed that sound coatings could be obtained in a narrow set of parameter range as the substrate-coating materials are metallurgically incompatible and have a propensity to form brittle intermetallics...|$|R

40|$|Volvo Car Corporation uses a new {{generation}} of four cylinder inline engines in their automobiles. The engine family is known as Volvo Engine Architecture and the differences between the different engines are the different power outputs made possible with different engine boosts. The VEA engines utilise a bedplate design for their engines where the main bearing supports are casted into the bedplate. For the high performance engines the main bearing supports need to be sprayed with an <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> to get a strong bonding with the bedplate. The spraying is, however, expensive and an alternative solution is sought. Four design proposals, which are based on the current design of the main bearing supports, were proposed. These design proposals does not use any of the sprayed <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> material. Instead they have been designed with the goal of getting a mechanical bonding, instead of the chemical bonding that the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>coating</b> provides. The design proposals were evaluated by static simulations and dynamic simulations to investigate the influence on the main bearings in terms of: • radial deformations of the main bearing profiles, • total pressure and asperity contact pressure and • friction losses. The contact behaviour between the bedplate and the main bearing supports, for the different design proposals, at high temperature were also investigated. The results from the simulations were compared to results from earlier work on the sprayed main bearing supports. None of the design proposals generally provided lower friction losses compared to the sprayed main bearing support. The differences in friction loss should also by weighed against the potential cost saving, which is a question for VCC. The sprayed main bearing supports showed in general higher asperity contact pressure compared to the design proposals. Most of the bonding between the bedplate and the main bearing supports occurred on the top surfaces and the sides of the main bearing supports for the different design proposals. An investigation of getting fatigue failure in the bedplate should also be considered, if VCC should proceed with {{one or more of the}} design proposals.

40|$|Recent advancements in {{manufacturing}} of light-weight structures have caused high interest in industries toward magnesium alloys {{because of its}} excellent properties such as specific strength, low density, and fatigue strength. Application of magnesium in the vehicle structure saves energy and reduces gas emission which consequently improves {{the performance of the}} vehicle. Magnesium alloys have low corrosion resistance and high tendency to corrode in humid and aqueous environments. The results of recent research show that cold spray coating of pure aluminum powder results in significant improvement in magnesium corrosion. However when tested under cyclic loads, the coated samples developed surface cracks and delamination. Which lead to highly localized corrosion damages underneath of the cracks or any discontinuity in the components. The early cracking was attributed to the low fatigue resistance of pure aluminum. The results of two new approaches in enhancing the corrosion fatigue life of coated magnesium are presented in this thesis. First, an <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>coating</b> powder with the higher fatigue strength was selected for coating. Al- 7075 powder, with average particle size of twenty microns have successfully been coated on AZ 31 B samples with highly densed, low porosity coated layer.

The excellent resulting hydrophobicity is attributed to the synergistic effects of micro/nanoroughness and low surface energy.

40|$|The {{interface}} between the matrix and reinforcement plays {{a crucial role}} in determining the properties of metal matrix composites (MMC). Coating of the reinforcement is an important technique by which the interfacial properties can be improved. In this work, weight deposition of copper coating on short basalt fibers was carried out by electroless method. The electroless process used to deposit the copper coating onto the basalt fiber relies on a sequence of sensitization time, activation time and metallization time and these parameters need to be optimized to know the amount of coating thickness. These parameters considered for optimization process are evaluated for different time intervals. An electroless method of coating on basalt fiber with copper deposition is described. The effects of time of sensitization on coating thickness, effects of time of activation on coating thickness and effect of time of metallization on coating thickness on basalt fiber are studied. Using this method it is possible to deposit up to about 25 wt copper on the basalt fiber with an average coating thickness about 0. 1050 to 0. 115 Î¼m.

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of testing of Ni-Al alloy coatings with different chemical constitution and phase composition, which might replace currently used electrolytic chromium coatings. Crust chromium coatings are suitable for reconditioning of machine parts because of their very good maintenance properties. However, due to toxicity of electrolylic chromium bath, their application tends to be restricted. Thermal flame and plasma spraying technologies were chosen for nickel aluminium coating application. Obtained coatings were distinguished by significant porosity of structure and surface roughness. The thickness of coatings ranged from 440 to 683 µm. Microhardness of coatings was not related to applied metal plating technology but to chemical constitution and phase composition. The more <b>aluminium</b> content in <b>alloy</b> <b>coating</b> the harder the coatings were. The hardness of coatings which resulted from NiAl phase was ca 250 HV 0. 04.
