5|$|While Hughes's time at RKO {{was marked}} by dwindling {{production}} <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>slew</b> <b>of</b> expensive flops, the studio continued to turn out some well-received films under production chiefs Sid Rogell and Sam Bischoff, though both became fed up with Hughes's meddling and quit after less than two years. (Bischoff {{would be the last}} man to hold the job under Hughes.) There were B noirs such as The Window (1949), which turned into a hit, and The Set-Up (1949), directed by Robert Wise and starring Robert Ryan, which won the Critic's Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. The Thing from Another World (1951), a science-fiction drama coproduced with Howard Hawks's Winchester Pictures, is seen as a classic of the genre. In 1952, RKO put out two films directed by Fritz Lang, Rancho Notorious and Clash by Night. The latter was a project of the renowned Jerry Wald–Norman Krasna production team, lured by Hughes from Warner Bros. with great fanfare in August 1950.|$|E

The song was recorded in Los Angeles, California at Can Am Studios in May 1996.

40|$|The {{responsiveness}} of {{the smallest}} blood vessels of the human skin was measured in systemic anoxemia, hypercapnia, acidosis, <b>and</b> alkalosis. <b>A</b> method was used which measured quantitatively the reactive hyperemia produced by a standardized period of local ischemia of these fine vessels. By timing the clearing period of the threshold hyperemia response a direct indication of blood flow in these fine vessels was obtained. The following conclusions were reached concerning the responses {{of the smallest}} blood vessels of the skin. 1. Systemic anoxemia causes a decrease in sensitivity to local ischemia <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>slowing</b> <b>of</b> the blood flow. 2. Hypercapnia prevents the changes resulting from anoxemia. 3.

With systemic acidosis there is a decrease in sensitivity to local ischemia <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>slowing</b> <b>of</b> blood flow. The exact opposite takes place in systemic alkalosis. 5. The view is advanced, after due consideration of the facts, that the carbon dioxide concentration of the blood, or something directly associated with it, is the most important factor determining the sensitivity of these vessels, rather than oxygen saturation or changes in blood pH...|$|R

2500|$|After being {{informed}} of his victory on November 15, 1844, Polk {{turned his attention}} towards forming a geographically-balanced Cabinet. Polk decided that his Cabinet would not contain many presidential aspirants, though he chose to nominate Buchanan for the crucial and prestigious position of Secretary of State. Polk wrote Van Buren and Wright {{with the intention of}} appointing an acceptable New Yorker to the position of Secretary of the Treasury, and the two recommended Azariah C. Flagg. Polk decided to nominate Senator Robert J. Walker of Mississippi to the position of Attorney General. Cave Johnson, a close friend and ally of Polk, would be nominated for the position of Postmaster General. Though Polk was personally close with the incumbent Navy Secretary, John Y. Mason, Polk sought to replace him due to Jackson's insistence that none of Tyler's Cabinet be retained. In his place, Polk would nominate George Bancroft, the historian who had placed a crucial role in Polk's nomination. For the position of Secretary of War, Polk sought to appoint Andrew Stevenson of Virginia, giving Polk's potential Cabinet three slave state leaders and three free state leaders. Polk's Cabinet choices met with the approval of Andrew Jackson, who Polk met with in January 1845 for the last time, as Jackson would die in June 1845. However, after news of Buchanan's selection for State was leaked, Vice President Dallas (an in-state rival of Buchanan) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>slew</b> <b>of</b> Southerners insisted that Walker receive the higher position at Treasury. Polk instead chose to nominate Bancroft as a compromise at Treasury while nominating Mason as Attorney General and a New Yorker, William L. Marcy, as Secretary of War. Polk had intended the Marcy appointment to mollify Van Buren, but Van Buren was outraged at the move, in part due to Marcy's affiliation with the rival [...] "Hunker" [...] faction. Polk then further enraged Van Buren by finally choosing to elevate Walker to Treasury, and Van Buren and Silas Wright became alienated from the incoming Polk administration. Thus, Polk's initial Cabinet selections would consist of Buchanan as Secretary of State, Walker as Secretary of the Treasury, Marcy as Secretary of War, Mason as Attorney General, Cave Johnson as Postmaster General, and Bancroft as Secretary of the Navy. All would win Senate confirmation after Polk took office.|$|E
