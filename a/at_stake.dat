5|$|The {{narrative}} centres on {{the intersection}} of Toshiko's romance with Tommy Brockless (Anthony Lewis), a 'cryogenically' frozen soldier from World War I, {{and a number of}} hazardous time slips from 1918. As the impending crisis becomes more severe, Toshiko must choose between the man she has fallen in love with and the world <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> Tommy eventually elects to return to 1918, where Toshiko knows he will be executed because of his shellshock.|$|E
5|$|Varys visits Ned in the dungeons {{and tells}} Ned {{that if he}} makes a false {{confession}} and swears loyalty to King Joffrey, Cersei will spare Ned and let him serve the Night's Watch as his exile. Ned initially refuses but relents after Varys tells him that his daughter Sansa's life is also <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although the appellants {{argued that}} natural justice had been {{breached}} {{because they had}} not been consulted prior to the issuance of the orders, the High Court observed that where the public interest is <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> the English courts have held that principles of natural justice must apply in a modified manner. In a 1977 case, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that the audi alteram partem ("hear the other side") principle {{did not need to be}} complied with if the public interest so demanded.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the case}} was filed in the Western District of Wisconsin, the judge there recused himself {{as a friend of}} the magazine. The case was {{therefore}} brought before Judge Robert W. Warren, a judge in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Because of the sensitive nature of information <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> in the trial, two separate hearings were conducted, one in public, and the other in camera. The defendants, Morland and the editors of The Progressive, would not accept security clearances, which would put restraints on their free speech, and so were not present at the in camera hearings. Their lawyers did obtain clearances so that they could participate, but were forbidden from conveying anything they heard there to their clients.|$|E
5|$|Black-backed and side-striped jackals, and African golden wolves {{will feed}} {{alongside}} hyenas, though {{they will be}} chased if they approach too closely. Spotted hyenas will sometimes follow jackals and wolves during the gazelle fawning season, as jackals and wolves are effective at tracking and catching young animals. Hyenas do not take to eating wolf flesh readily; four hyenas were reported to take half an hour in eating a golden wolf. Overall, the two animals typically ignore each other {{when there is no}} food or young <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kingcraft {{began his}} career in a Triennial <b>Stakes</b> <b>at</b> Ascot {{in which he was}} beaten a head by a filly.

5|$|Doctor Phlox {{receives}} {{a letter from}} his Interspecies Medical Exchange counterpart, Doctor Jeremy Lucas, who is serving a term on Denobula. He begins to compose a letter back, describing his experiences with the crew, {{and the ways in}} which humans are different. Meanwhile, on the Bridge, the crew are discussing a pre-warp vessel they have encountered. The alien they speak with, a Valakian, begs them to assist with a medical emergency their species is facing. Sub-Commander T'Pol reveals that the Vulcans are unaware of the species, but she agrees with Captain Archer to help them. Phlox continues his letter, describing the challenges of treating the disease – with over fifty million lives <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b>|$|E
5|$|Double Dare 2000 {{introduced}} the Triple Dare Challenge. Available only in round two, this allowed {{a team to}} make their physical challenge more difficult, increasing its value by $100, and putting a bonus prize <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> Difficulties included reducing the time limit, adding an extra item to the stunt, or increasing the overall difficulty of the stunt. The actual modifier was not revealed unless the team decided to accept the challenge. If the team did not complete the challenge successfully, the money, prize, and control went to their opponents.|$|E
5|$|Her next film, Ragat'e Anak (For The Sake of Children), {{dealt with}} the lives of two {{part-time}} prostitutes in a cemetery in Tulungagung, East Java. The documentary was included in Pertaruhan (<b>At</b> <b>Stake),</b> a compilation of works produced by the Kalyana Shira Foundation. In August 2006, Ucu released a short story compilation, Dunia di Kepala Alice (The World in Alice's Head), and a novel, Being Ing. On 4 June 2009, the Tulungagung government shut down the prostitution district {{as a result of}} the documentary; in response, Ucu said that she regretted the decision.|$|E

5|$|In London, Bond learns his {{objective}} is determining how Goldfinger smuggles gold internationally. The {{chancellor of the}} exchequer and M explain that gold prices vary across the world, allowing one to profit by selling bullion internationally. Bond arranges to meet Goldfinger socially at his country club in Kent, and wins a high-stakes golf game against him with a recovered Nazi gold bar <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> Bond follows him to Switzerland, where Tilly, Jill's sister, makes an unsuccessful attempt at revenge by firing a rifle at Goldfinger.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} full {{season at the}} new ground, 1997–98, Sunderland {{finished}} third in Division One. After beating Sheffield United in the Football League play-offs semi-final, they reached the final at Wembley with {{a place in the}} Premier League <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> Over 40,000fans travelled from the North-East to see the game against Charlton Athletic. The match was drawn 4–4 after extra time had been played; Charlton, however, won the game on a penalty shootout, after Michael Gray had his penalty saved by Charlton goalkeeper Saša Ilić.|$|E
5|$|Knowing {{that his}} {{reputation}} was <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> following the much publicised Tora! Tora! Tora! debacle, Kurosawa {{moved quickly to}} a new project to prove he was still viable. To his aid came friends and famed directors Keisuke Kinoshita, Masaki Kobayashi and Kon Ichikawa, who together with Kurosawa established in July 1969 a production company called the Club of the Four Knights (Yonki no kai). Although the plan was for the four directors to create a film each, {{it has been suggested}} that the real motivation for the other three directors was to make it easier for Kurosawa to successfully complete a film, and therefore find his way back into the business.|$|E

5|$|Macrae, Ismay and Churchill all saw fit {{to record}} these {{arguments}} over the technical issue of stickiness. As Eden had pointed out, {{there was a}} lot <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> The British infantry and Home Guard had little with which to put up a fight against tanks and to any who had witnessed trials of Molotov Cocktails and SIP grenades it was evident that they could do little to a modern tank other than to provide a blinding pall of smoke. What was needed was a hand weapon to deliver a coup de grâce by punching through the armoured plate. The sticky bomb could do the job and little else was available.|$|E
5|$|Often, {{teams will}} finish a season with {{identical}} records. It becomes necessary, therefore, to devise means to break these ties, either {{to determine which}} teams will qualify for the playoffs, or to determine seeding in the playoff tournament. The rules below are applied in order until the tie is broken. If three teams are tied for one playoff spot and the third team is eliminated at any step, the tie breaker reverts to step one for the remaining two teams. If multiple playoff spots are <b>at</b> <b>stake,</b> the rules are applied in order until the first team qualifies, then the process is started again for the remaining teams.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes may {{compete with}} striped hyenas on large carcasses. Red foxes may {{give way to}} hyenas on unopened carcasses, as the latter's {{stronger}} jaws can easily tear open flesh that is too tough for foxes. Foxes may harass hyenas, using their smaller size and greater speed to avoid the hyena's attacks. Sometimes, foxes seem to deliberately torment hyenas even {{when there is no}} food <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> Some foxes may mistime their attacks, and are killed. Fox remains are often found in hyena dens, and hyenas may steal foxes from traps.|$|E

5|$|San Martín did {{not take}} hostages or ask for ransoms, but rather he {{instructed}} his people to avoid further conflicts {{and to try to}} restore peaceful relations with the royalists. Zabala requested assistance for his wounded soldiers, which San Martín provided and he invited Zabala to share a large breakfast, which he accepted. San Martín was aware that the new enlightened ideas <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> in the Napoleonic Wars influenced many of the Spanish military, and expected to convince Zabala that absolutism was a bad cause to defend. He succeeded, as Zabala joined the patriot forces under San Martín's command during his administration in Mendoza.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} the duty to act fairly varies greatly from case to case. Basic norms of {{fairness}} {{in the conduct of}} disciplinary proceedings need to be observed more strictly where the vocational future of a person is <b>at</b> <b>stake,</b> where there is an express duty on an association to make a decision only after conducting a hearing or an inquiry, and where the exercise of disciplinary powers may deprive a person of his or her property rights or impose a penalty on him or her.|$|E
5|$|After the Holland fight, Dyer {{made several}} {{attempts}} at a rematch with Darcy, reportedly {{to the exclusion}} of other fights, in the belief that the encounter would draw a big crowd and a large purse. The postponed fight with Delmen was again mooted, but this too never occurred. In the meantime Dyer continued to busy himself with charity work, setting up a boxing fund for injured soldiers in Sydney, and continued to tour the vaudeville circuit in New South Wales. Dyer's persistence eventually paid off, and an encounter with Darcy was arranged for 9 October at Rushcutters Bay Stadium, with the Middleweight Championship title <b>at</b> <b>stake.</b> The fight was a one-sided affair, with Dyer outclassed throughout. Although Darcy was warned for a low blow in the fourth round, Dyer was never in the fight and his corner threw in the towel after one minute of the sixth round.|$|E
