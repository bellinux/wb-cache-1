40|$|Patient {{monitoring}} {{generates a}} large number of alarms, the vast majority of which are false. Excessive non-actionable medical alarms lead to alarm fatigue, a well-recognized patient safety issue. While multiple approaches to reduce alarm fatigue have been explored, patterns in alarming and inter-alarm relationships, as they manifest in the clinical workspace, are largely a black-box and hamper research efforts towards reducing alarms.

40|$|An {{international}} {{trend in}} intensive care is the shift from open, bay area intensive care units towards single-patient room care, since this is considered optimal for patient healing and family privacy. However, {{in the intensive care}} setting, an increasing number of devices and parameters are being used to treat and monitor the patient. This leads to {{an increase in the number}} of alarms that are needed to notify caretakers. In single room care, additional technology is also necessary in order to distribute alarms from the source to the healthcare worker's location such as a distributed alarming system. While single-room care creates a better environment for healing, it poses challenges for managing alarms. This book chapter discusses alarm management in detail. An example of alarm management in a single-patient intensive care situation along with the prevalent rates of different alarms for an adult and a neonatal ICU (NICU) in a general teaching hospital are also discussed.

While plantar pressure measurements have long been present, only recently evidence shows their importance in ulcer prevention, as a data-driven approach to therapeutic footwear provision. The long-term monitoring of plantar pressures with the option to provide feedback, when <b>alarming</b> <b>pressure</b> levels occur, is a promising development in this area, although more technical and clinical validation is required.

40|$|Objective　To {{evaluate}} the stability, {{safety and efficacy}} of mobile blood purification system {{in the treatment of}} acute renal failure dog model in the field environment. Methods　The acute renal failure model was established in 4 dogs by bilateral nephrectomy, which was thereafter treated with the mobile blood purification system. The evaluation of functional index of the mobile blood purification system was performed after a short-time (2 hours) and conventional (4 hours) dialysis treatment. Results　The mobile blood purification system ran stably in the field environment at a blood flow of 150 - 180 ml/min, a dialysate velocity of 2000 ml/h, a replacement fluid velocity of 2000 ml/h, and ultrafiltration rate of 100 - 200 ml/h. All the functions of alarming system worked well, including static upper limit <b>alarm</b> of ultrafiltration <b>pressure</b> (> 100 mmHg), upper limit alarm of ambulatory arterial pressure (> 400 mmHg), upper limit alarm of ambulatory venous pressure (> 400 mmHg), bubble alarm of vascular access, bubble alarm during the infusion of solutions, <b>pressure</b> <b>alarm</b> at the substitution pump segment and blood leaking alarm. The vital signs of the 4 dogs with acute renal failure kept stable during the treatment. After the treatment, a remarkable decrease was seen in the levels of serum urea nitrogen, creatinine and serum potassium (P 0. 05). Conclusions　The mobile blood purification system runs normally even in a field environment. It is a flexible and portable device with a great performance in safety and stability in the treatment of acute renal failure. 		 		DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2013. 12. 1...|$|R

Measurements of fire <b>alarm</b> sound <b>pressure</b> levels (SPLs) in five elder care centres showed that the sound output of a fire alarm can be depreciated after installation. The alarm level of a new fire alarm installation could alert most of the building occupants but could not awaken a sleeping person. Subjective ratings on the fire alarm audibility in terms of minimum fire alarm SPL were studied with 230 awaken subjects divided by two age groups (22 - 48 and 66 - 88) in the five elder care centres. A higher perceived SPL is preferred for the elder age group to obtain the same subjective rating, {{when compared with the}} younger age group. Correlations between the subjective ratings and the measured SPL show that the alarm SPL of 65 dBA can alert most of the occupants in daytime, but expressed a preference that the alarm SPL be increased. The results show that the minimum required fire alarm SPL is 74. 5 dBA, which agrees with the recommended alarm SPL at bed head of 75 dBA in the design guidelines. The depreciation of SPL of alarm sounder and the preferred SPL of occupants should be considered in designing a fire alarm system for elder care centres.

For example, transient changes of pressure affects the oxygen sensors, causing signal spikes and increasing the risk of false <b>alarms.</b> Also, constant <b>pressure</b> can in some instances cause a zero shift on some sensors, and this can be negative so that the sensor under-reads.

40|$|To warn of the {{stability}} of retaining wall structures with damage, a simplified mechanical model and a finite element model of this retaining wall-soil coupling system are established. Via finite element model updating, a baseline finite element model of the wall-soil system is acquired.

The demand valve could also provide oxygen at any flow rate required to a conscious patient in respiratory distress.

DC dysfunction can be diagnosed as frequent arterial and venous <b>pressure</b> <b>alarms,</b> which reveal a high negative outflow pressure {{and an increase in}} venous pressure. DC dysfunction can be indicated by low values of urea reduction in patients on continuous or intermittent RRT techniques [21] or by low Kt/V values in patients on intermittent hemodialysis [22]. In the latter, the delivered RRT dose can be easily estimated by ionic dialysance measurement [23]. The RRT dose should be prescribed before each session of RRT and the actual delivered dose regularly assessed. In the VA/NIH study, there were no differences in outcome between patients receiving a weekly 3.9 Kt/V and a weekly 7.8 Kt/V [24]. It is therefore recommended to deliver a Kt/V of 3.9 per week [5]. In continuous RRT, the VA/NIH study and the RENAL study showed no differences in mortality between doses of 20 ml/kg/h and 35 ml/kg/h nor between 25 ml/kg/h and 40 ml/kg/h [24, 25]. In continuous RRT, it is recommended to deliver an effluent volume of 20 – 25 ml/kg/h [5].

Objectives To test the effect of an intervention (adding or removing air) on the proportion of time that cuff pressure was between 20 and 30 cm H 2 O and to evaluate changes in cuff pressure over time. Methods A repeated-measure crossover design was used to study 32 orally intubated patients receiving mechanical venti-lation for two 12 -hour shifts (randomized control and interven-tion conditions). Continuous cuff pressure monitoring was initiated, and the pressure was adjusted to a minimum of 22 cm H 2 O.

30|$|We {{conducted}} {{our study}} only for {{one type of}} transport (to CT scan) to exclude {{risk factors related to}} the radiology procedures and to identify risk factors related to the patient (and not to diseases or invasive techniques). Few IHT were performed after working hours. The time of day or day of the week had no influence on AE during IHT. The severity of patients and invasive devices are not predictive of AE during IHT. Even if this was assumed in other studies [11], it has not yet been demonstrated. We found sedation of the patient before transport, PEEP > 6 cmH 2 O, and the need for fluid infusion for transport to be risk factors for any AE during IHT. Sedation of the patient as high PEEP is a known risk factor in the literature [8 – 11, 16, 20] but not treatment modification identified in our study as a risk factor for patient-related AE. It is possible that transport was undertaken too early after treatment modification with insufficient time for stabilization, leading to a direct risk to the patient. Treatment modifications were primarily increase in sedation or fluid challenge, which should perhaps change our attitude. However, patient severity was not associated with AE during IHT. The number of infusion pumps was predictive of AE during IHT in univariate but not multivariate analysis, which also was shown by Doring [19]. This {{may be related to the}} fact that we limit the number of infusion pumps during transport in our protocol. We listed many equipment-related incidents during transport, which were usually battery problems or improperly set <b>alarms</b> (high <b>pressure</b> on ventilator). We used second- and third-generation respirators as recommended for these types of IHT [25]. Third-generation respirator was used preferentially if the patient was treated for ARDS or if ventilatory mode of the patient before IHT was PSV. The material used does not explain AE (no statistical difference). Experienced or anaesthetist junior physicians had fewer equipment-related incidents than the other junior physicians, because they are more familiar with the equipment used and may better anticipate potential problems with these devices. Most of these equipment-related incidents appear to be preventable, particularly those affecting the transport ventilators. They should be avoided by proper preparation and checks before IHT. Good coordination between the radiology team and the ICU is essential, because duration of transport also is associated with patient-related AE, a point already shown in other studies, such as those by Lahner or Smith [9, 26].|$|R

In a randomized controlled study, we evaluated automatic respiratory weaning in ASV for early tracheal extubation after cardiac surgery. Eligible patients were assigned to either an ASV protocol or a standard one consisting of synchronized intermittent ventilation followed by pressure support. Eighteen patients completed the ASV protocol, and 16 completed the standard one. There were no differences between groups in perioperative characteristics, lengths of tracheal intubation and intensive care unit stay, and ventilatory variables, except less peak inspiratory pressure during the initial phase in ASV (17. 5 +/- 0. 8 versus 22. 2 +/- 0. 8 cm H(2) O; P < 0. 01). ASV patients required fewer ventilatory settings manipulations (2. 4 +/- 0. 7 versus 4. 0 +/- 0. 8 manipulations per patient; P < 0. 05) and endured less high-inspiratory <b>pressure</b> <b>alarms</b> (0. 7 +/- 2. 4 versus 2. 9 +/- 3. 0; P < 0. 05). These results suggest that in this specific population of patients, automation of postoperative ventilation with ASV resulted in an outcome similar to the control group. The internal logic of the new device resulted in less manipulation of the setting and alarms that could simplify respiratory management. IMPLICATIONS: Adaptive support ventilation (ASV), a ventilatory mode providing automatic adjustment of the settings was compared with standard management for rapid tracheal extubation after cardiac surgery. The two approaches were equal in terms of outcome. In ASV, we observed fewer ventilator settings manipulations and a smaller amount of alarms, suggesting that this automatic mode may simplify postoperative respiratory management without delaying extubation...|$|R
