Bush {{provided}} backing vocals for a song that was recorded during the 1990s titled Wouldn't Change <b>a</b> <b>Thing</b> by Lionel Azulay, the drummer with the original band that was later to become the KT Bush Band. The song, which was engineered and produced by Del Palmer, was released on Azulay's album Out of the Ashes.|$|E
5|$|Avicenna {{distinguishes between}} <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> that needs an {{external}} cause {{in order to}} exista contingent thingand <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> that is guaranteed to exist by its essence or intrinsic naturea necessary existent. The argument, or proof, tries to prove that there is indeed a necessary existent. It does this by first considering whether the opposite could be true: that everything that exists is contingent. Each contingent thing will need something other than itself to bring it into existence, which will in turn need another cause to bring it into existence, and so on. Because this seemed to lead to an infinite regress, cosmological arguments before Avicenna concluded that some necessary cause (such as God) is needed to end the infinite chain. However, Avicenna's argument does not preclude {{the possibility of an}} infinite regress.|$|E
5|$|By the Late Middle Ages (approx 1300-1550), large battles {{became more}} common, {{probably}} because {{of the success of}} infantry tactics and changes in weaponry. However, because such tactics left the knight unmounted, the role of the war horse also changed. By the 17th century, the medieval charger had become <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> of the past, replaced by lighter, unarmoured horses.|$|E

5|$|Chaplin {{never spoke}} more than cursorily about his filmmaking methods, {{claiming}} such <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> would be {{tantamount to a}} magician spoiling his own illusion. Little was known about his working process throughout his lifetime, but research from film historians – particularly the findings of Kevin Brownlow and David Gill that were presented in the three-part documentary Unknown Chaplin (1983) – has since revealed his unique working method.|$|E
5|$|Existence is a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms of perfection and imperfection, strength, and weakness… And the culmination of its perfection, where there is nothing more perfect, is its independence from any other thing. Nothing more perfect should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, perfection is prior to imperfection, actuality to potency, and existence to non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the perfection of <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> is the thing itself, and not <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> in addition to it. Thus, either existence is independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure existence. Nothing is more perfect than Him. And in Him {{there is no room for}} non-existence or imperfection. The latter is other than Him, and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other than Him there is no subsistence, unless through Him. For there is no imperfection in the reality of existence, and imperfection is added to existence only because of the quality of being caused, as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence.|$|E

5|$|Realizing {{that the}} plains Indians {{would have no}} {{experience}} on water, the townspeople fled prudently from the Comanche raiders {{to the safety of}} the water.

5|$|This {{contains}} {{the notion of}} a being that cannot be conceived not to exist. He argued that if something can be conceived not to exist, then something greater can be conceived. Consequently, <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> than which nothing greater can be conceived cannot be conceived not to exist and so it must exist. This can be read as a restatement of the argument in Chapter 2, although Norman Malcolm believed it to be a different, stronger argument.|$|E

Clark said: “Heikkinen weighed only 183 pounds and was pretty light for our league. He reported late and didn’t give himself a fair chance to show me what he could do.

5|$|As a result, {{the gods}} and goddesses meet and hold <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> to discuss and debate the matter.

Thor rejects the idea, yet Loki interjects {{that this will be}} the only way to get back Mjöllnir. Loki points out that, without Mjöllnir, the jötnar will be able to invade and settle in Asgard. The gods dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to Jötunheimr together.|$|E

5|$|Caligula's first acts {{were said}} to be generous in spirit, though many were {{political}} in nature. To gain support, he granted bonuses to the military, including the Praetorian Guard, city troops and the army outside Italy. He destroyed Tiberius's treason papers, declared that treason trials were <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> of the past, and recalled those who had been sent into exile. He helped those who had been harmed by the imperial tax system, banished certain sexual deviants, and put on lavish spectacles for the public, including gladiatorial games. Caligula collected and brought back the bones of his mother and of his brothers and deposited their remains in the tomb of Augustus.|$|E
5|$|His {{observations}} of the satellites of Jupiter caused a revolution in astronomy: a planet with smaller planets orbiting it did not conform {{to the principles of}} Aristotelian cosmology, which held that all heavenly bodies should circle the Earth, and many astronomers and philosophers initially refused to believe that Galileo could have discovered such <b>a</b> <b>thing.</b> His observations were confirmed by the observatory of Christopher Clavius and he received a hero's welcome when he visited Rome in 1611. Galileo continued to observe the satellites over the next eighteen months, and by mid-1611, he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods—a feat which Kepler had believed impossible.|$|E
