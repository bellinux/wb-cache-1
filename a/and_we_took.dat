500|$|Earthsuit {{began in}} 1995 as a {{collaboration}} between Adam LaClave and Paul Meany, who began composing music together after being introduced at a church in New Orleans. In an interview with Family Christian Stores, Meany explained that a sermon was {{the inspiration for the}} band's name: [...] "...This man was preaching about how humans are really spirit beings encased in fleshly bodies. The term [...] "earth suit" [...] came up. At the time we liked it, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>took</b> it." [...] The two regularly performed at Café Joel, a small coffeehouse their church had started where Meany was music director. These performances helped cultivate their unique sound and introduced them to future band member David Rumsey.|$|E

For this reason, as Hoxha relates in his memoirs, [...] "The Khrushchevites were capable of anything <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>took</b> our own measures... Hysni and Ramiz stayed on in Moscow, as they had to sign the declaration" [...] while Hoxha left the Soviet Union by train and [...] "arrived in Austria, went down by train through Italy and from Bari returned safe and sound to Tirana on our own aircraft and {{went directly to the}} reception organized {{on the occasion of the}} 28th and 29th of November." ...|$|E
500|$|It is {{not clear}} whether the baby was Carrie or another baby of Laura's, or what became of the child. William Bittle and Gilbert Geis wrote in 1964 that Laura had been caring for a baby while in jail, and had the child with her when she was taken from her cell. They quoted a woman who had seen either the lynching or its aftermath, and who said that Laura had placed the baby on the ground: [...] "After they had hung them up, those men just walked off and left that baby lying there. One of my neighbors was there, and she picked the baby up and brought it to town, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>took</b> care of it. It's all grown up now and lives here." ...|$|E

500|$|On 20 February 1947, Attlee {{announced}} Mountbatten's appointment, {{and that}} Britain would transfer power in India {{not later than}} June 1948. Mountbatten took office as Viceroy on 24 March 1947, two days after his arrival in India. By then, the Congress had come around {{to the idea of}} partition. Nehru stated in 1960, [...] "the truth is that we were tired men and we were getting on in years... The plan for partition offered a way out <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>took</b> it." [...] Leaders of the Congress decided that having loosely tied Muslim-majority provinces as part of a future India was not worth the loss of the powerful government at the centre which they desired. However, the Congress insisted that if Pakistan were to become independent, Bengal and Punjab would have to be divided.|$|E
500|$|In September 2009, it was {{announced}} that actress Betty White would guest star on the show playing herself. After winning his second Emmy Award as Jack Donaghy at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards in that same month, Alec Baldwin revealed that White was the cast's first choice to make a guest appearance. [...] "We all put names in a hat, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>took</b> a vote– if you could have one guest star for the whole season, who would it be? And Betty White was the winner." [...] Television host Jimmy Fallon played himself in [...] "Stone Mountain". The character Rick Wayne, a ventriloquist, was played by real-life ventriloquist Jeff Dunham.

500|$|A year {{prior to}} {{recording}} the album, jazz producer Tommy LiPuma and an unnamed keyboardist tried out some ideas {{for five days}} with Paul McCartney at McCartney's home studio in East Sussex. Featuring just vocals and piano, the trio [...] "put about 15-20 songs on tape", to see what tracks would work. Around this time, an unknown McCartney original was recorded, {{with the help of}} engineer Geoff Emerick. The songs that McCartney would work on were voted upon democratically: McCartney comments, [...] "I pulled up some [...] from my memories, when I was a kid and we had family sing-songs, which was the original inspiration for the whole idea, I said to Tom, 'Let's look at these ones. This is the kind of era I want to look at.' Tommy himself suggested some; a girl in my office; [...] Diana [...] suggested some.

However, under Farhi's direction, Abu-Nabbut was ousted from Jaffa in 1818. According to historian Mikhail Mishaqah, [...] "those who had loved Sulayman" [...] beckoned Farhi to lobby the Sublime Porte (imperial Ottoman government) to appoint Mustafa Bey as successor, but Farhi retorted that Abdullah [...] "was born in this country <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>took</b> great pains to teach him Arabic, nice handwriting and the legal sciences" [...] and that as katkhuda he gained [...] "experience in governing" [...] {{and it would not}} be [...] "right to promote over him someone whose Arabic is weak and who neither knows the legal system nor has experience in governing." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{announcement}} of the removal of Morsi was met with cheers in Tahrir Square.

Mohamed el-Baradei says the coup was to rectify {{the issues of the}} revolution. The Coptic Pope Tawadros II, Grand Imam of al-Azhar Ahmed el-Tayeb, Mohamed ElBaradei and some of the youth leaders of Tamarod, Mahmoud Badr and Mohamed Abdelaziz, spoke in support of the military intervention. The al-Nour party also commented in saying that the events occurred as they were not heard in their call for dialogue. Party Secretary-General Galal Murra commented that: [...] "we took this position (on agreeing to the army political road map) <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>took</b> these decisions only so we stop the bloodshed of our people." [...] Pro-Morsi protesters heard a statement from Morsi, which was published on his Facebook page. He called the move a [...] "coup" [...] and rejected the Armed Forces' statement.|$|E
2500|$|Alas, {{with what}} sadness his friends {{came to know}} {{that while he was}} doing so much to warn and restore others from the effects of this fearful habit, he himself was still under its bondage.

I went directly to bed, but he was a long time making his preparations, and I at length suspected he was indulging his old craving. For the first and only time in my life I spoke harshly to him, and characterized his abuse of himself and of the confidence of his friends as shameful. He replied depreciatingly, and turning down the gas-light came around and crept into bed beside me. We both lay a moment in silence, and feeling reproved for my harshness, I said: “Think, Fitz, of your warnings on the subject, and of your effort, in behalf of other victims.” In a tone and with a pathos I can never forget, he answered — “He saved others, himself he could not save.” ...|$|E
