Yoshioka tried to reassure Puyi by saying that the [...] "human bullets" [...] were crying [...] "manly Japanese tears" [...] as deep down they wanted to die for the Emperor, but Puyi later stated he was not convinced by this argument.|$|E

2500|$|Reverse swing {{occurs in}} exactly the same manner as {{conventional}} swing, despite popular misconception. Over time the rough side becomes too rough <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tears</b> become too deep – this is why golf ball dimples are never below a certain depth, and so [...] "conventional" [...] swing weakens over time; the separation point moves {{toward the front of the}} ball on the rough side. When polishing the shiny side of the ball, numerous liquids are used, such as sweat, saliva, sunscreen, hair gel (which bowlers may apply to their hair before a game) and other illegal substances like Vaseline (applied to the clothing where the ball is polished). These liquids penetrate the porous surface of the leather ball. Over time the liquid expands and stretches the surface of the ball (which increases the surface area meaning more lift) and creates raised bumps on the polished side, due to the non-uniform nature of the expansion. The valleys between the bumps hold the air in the same manner as the tears on the rough side. This creates a layer of air over the shiny side, moving the separation point towards the back of the ball on the shiny side. The greater air coverage is now on the shiny side, giving rise to more lift and faster secondary airflow on that side. There is therefore lower static pressure on the shiny side, causing the ball to swing towards it, not away from it as in conventional swing.|$|E
2500|$|Early 20th century Birmingham also {{featured}} several notable poets {{who were not}} associated with the Auden circle. John Drinkwater {{was one of the}} originators of the Georgian Poetry movement in 1912, and one of only five poets whose work was to feature in all of the Georgian Poetry anthologies. Later editions of the series also included the work of the Halesowen-born, Birmingham-educated writer Francis Brett Young. Charles Madge, later the founder of Mass-Observation and Professor of Sociology at Birmingham University, was a leading Surrealist poet during the 1930s. His poetry featured regularly in the London Bulletin, and his 1933 article [...] "Surrealism for the English" [...] advocated that English surrealist poets would need to combine knowledge of [...] "the philosophical position of the French surrealists" [...] with [...] "a knowledge of their own language and literature" [...] two or three years before most people in England had even heard of the movement. Henry Treece, who was born in Wednesbury and educated at the University of Birmingham, led the neo-romantic reaction against Auden Group in the late 1930s and 1940s as {{one of the founders of}} the New Apocalyptics, describing the movement in his 1946 work How I See Apocalypse: [...] "In my definition, the writer who senses the chaos, the turbulence, the laughter <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tears,</b> the order and the peace of the world in its entirety, is an Apocalyptic writer.

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} effect of {{diabetes}} mellitus on the keratoepitheliopathy in glaucoma patients with and without diabetes mellitus who were treated with anti-glaucoma eye drops. Methods: <b>The</b> presence <b>and</b> severity of keratoepitheliopathy was investigated in the eyes of 36 glaucoma patients with diabetes mellitus and 47 nondiabetic patients who had glaucoma. All the patients had used anti-glaucoma eye drops. The ocular factors examined were the status of the lipid layer of <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> fluid assessed by a specular reflection video recording system, <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> volume assessed by <b>the</b> Schirmer test, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> film stability assessed by tear break-up time (BUT). Results: The incidence of superficial punctate keratitis (SPK) was 36. 1 % in the diabetic patients with glaucoma and 27. 7 % in the nondiabetic patients with glaucoma. Serious cases of SPK were seen only in the diabetic patients with glaucoma. The uniformity of <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> lipid layer, results of <b>the</b> Schirmer test, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>tear</b> BUT in <b>the</b> diabetic patients with glaucoma were similar to those in the nondiabetic patients with glaucoma. Conclusion: In glaucoma patients who use anti-glaucoma eye drops, the effects of diabetes mellitus on <b>the</b> keratoepitheliopathy <b>and</b> other ocular factors are not significant. However, we must consider the serious cases of keratoepitheliopathy in these patients. Jpn J Ophthalmol 2003; 47 : 287...|$|R
