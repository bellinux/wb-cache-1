You can take them from any country you like, wherever you can find them– Hungary, Poland, the Ostmark, from Theresienstadt, from Auschwitz, wherever you like.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, you are. There's {{plenty of}} aestheticism <b>about</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> people--plenty of good intentions--but not {{an ounce of}} real business!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She did not disapprove. She {{knew all}} <b>about</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> family, {{although}} {{she had never seen}} you until you were at her island." ...|$|E
60|$|CLARE. My nerves {{have gone}} funny lately. It's being always on one's guard, and stuffy air, and feeling people look <b>and</b> talk <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> dislike <b>your</b> being there.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{prejudice}}!" [...] said Ellesmere; [...] "I scorn to prejudice man, woman, or child, {{in the way}} of a fellow-servant; only I wish your ladyship to look <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> use <b>your</b> own eyes--that is all." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, yes. You {{will find}} it {{pleasant}} enough, by and bye. I am the ship's doctor. The purser has been telling me <b>about</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> mother.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh! I've heard <b>about</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> two brothers, Dick Rover. They {{tell all}} sorts of stories about you, but I don't believe the half of them." ...|$|E
5000|$|On Headspace {{official}} website, it is {{specified that}} the album [...] "is <b>about</b> <b>you</b> listener <b>and</b> <b>your</b> relationship with humanity, ultimately the battles fought within the mind from child to man". The Kübler-Ross model is cited {{as an important}} element of the lyric's meaning.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Did I?' said Squeers; 'well, it {{was rather}} a startling thing for a {{stranger}} to come and recommend himself by saying that he knew all <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> what <b>your</b> name was, <b>and</b> why <b>you</b> were living so quiet here, <b>and</b> what <b>you</b> had boned, <b>and</b> who <b>you</b> boned it from, wasn't it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Pearson {{said she}} {{believed}} {{there was a good}} deal of affectation <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> that with <b>your</b> dark hair <b>and</b> pale face <b>you</b> looked to her like some sort of a sentimental noodle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The fact is," [...] {{he said at}} length, [...] "I most {{sincerely}} {{hope you}} will forgive me, but I have been thinking a great deal <b>about</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> future welfare." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! {{be quiet}} now, Leo," [...] she said impatiently. [...] "Can't {{you see that}} my hands are as full as I can manage, without my having to bother <b>about</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> jealous tempers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So this is Thomas Rover," [...] said Captain Victor Putnam, with {{something}} like {{a twinkle in his}} clear eyes. [...] "Rover, I have heard a rather serious report <b>about</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> brother Richard." ...|$|E
5000|$|Journalists {{always ask}} {{difficult}} questions. It {{is quite a}} strain in a way, having your picture in the papers <b>and</b> things <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> getting <b>your</b> picture on television. It was not so bad, but I never enjoyed it. Now there are girls here in Holland who {{go out of their}} way to seek publicity, and it is good because it draws attention to women's racing, but I could never go running after the reporters and so on.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] Andrew answered. [...] "It is not I, Cecil, who desire {{to come here}} and say these things to any guest of yours. It is you who are {{sheltering}} under this roof one man at least to whom you should never have offered your hospitality. The Duke of Westerham, who has been my guest for the last few days, told me all that one needs to know <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> sir, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> career." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How do <b>you</b> do? <b>and</b> how are <b>your</b> family? What did {{you stop}} {{out at the}} door for? You're one of Mr. Blyth's guests, and have as much right inside {{as any of the}} rest of us. Stand there, and listen, <b>and</b> look <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> inform <b>your</b> mind. This is an age of progress, gardener; your class is coming uppermost, and time it did too. Go on, Blyth." [...] And again the Dowager Countess took a pinch of snuff, looking contemptuously at the lady who had spoken of the [...] "mixture of people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was awful}} {{for him to}} get up that report about another party," [...] {{answered}} the girl. [...] "Of course I didn't think it was true--that is, not what he said <b>about</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> cousins." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{gave her}} a chair, and took a seat himself before replying. [...] "Yes, I shall tell him all about it, and <b>about</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> father and mother. He shall know how kind you've all been to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Barrington {{looked at}} him steadily. [...] "Lance," [...] she said, [...] "there is {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> speeches that occasionally puzzles me. Now, of course, {{that was the only}} rejoinder you could make, but I fancied you meant it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Take {{a little}} time to look <b>about</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> get <b>your</b> bearings, child. The world you have been living in is a much simpler, honester one than that you are now to enter. Test {{yourself}} a bit and see if the old ways seem best after all, for you are old enough to decide, and wise enough to discover, what is for your truest good, I hope," [...] he said, trying to feel ready to let the bird escape from under his wing and make little flights alone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir Michael, it seems, {{has been}} making {{inquiries}} <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> learned of <b>your</b> present position," [...] the Duke continued. [...] "He asked me certain questions which I {{was glad to be}} able to answer on your behalf. He also entrusted me with a note, which I have here in my pocket." ...|$|R
6000|$|Before Old Mother Nature could reply Peter Rabbit spoke up. [...] "But {{the lesson}} is to be <b>about</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> family. Do you expect to learn {{anything}} about yourself?" [...] he demanded, and chuckled as if he thought that a great joke.|$|E
6000|$|... "Title {{and vast}} estates?" [...] {{he said with}} an ironical laugh. [...] "Nay! Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse, the bait is passing clumsy. An you wish me to hold my tongue <b>about</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> affairs, you'll have to be vastly sharper than that." ...|$|E
6000|$|Gab. [...] Not I! and if [...] I were, what {{is there}} to espy in you? [...] Although, I recollect, his {{frequent}} question [...] <b>About</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> spouse might lead to some [...] Suspicion; but you best know--what--and why. [...] I am his deadliest foe.|$|E
6000|$|... "O, I heard <b>about</b> <b>you</b> {{down in the}} cabin," [...] {{replied the}} stranger; [...] "and <b>about</b> <b>you</b> too, Jennie, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> {{beautiful}} little kitten. But I will explain {{the meaning of the}} bells to you. I know all about them. I belong on board this ship. I am the surgeon." ...|$|R
60|$|I confess I {{was now a}} {{good deal}} agitated. It is {{difficult}} to watch the toils closing slowly <b>and</b> surely <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> to retain <b>your</b> composure; <b>and</b> I was glad that Rowley was not present to spy on my confusion. I was flushed, my breath came thick; I cannot {{remember a time when}} I was more put out.|$|R
6000|$|TERESA. Is it me {{you offer}} such a name to, you fou-mouthed, dirty-minded, lying, sloothering old sow, you? I wouldn't soil my tongue by calling you in <b>your</b> right name <b>and</b> telling Sir Pearce what's the common {{talk of the}} town <b>about</b> <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> O'Flahertys! setting {{yourself}} up agen the Driscolls that would never lower themselves to be seen in conversation with you at the fair. You can keep your ugly stingy lump of a son; for what is he but a common soldier? and God help the girl that gets him, say I! So {{the back of my hand}} to <b>you,</b> Mrs O'Flaherty; <b>and</b> that the cat may tear your ugly old face! ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl laughed. [...] "Well," [...] she said, [...] "most of {{the folks}} in this {{province}} who read newspapers have. There was a column <b>about</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> sick partner and the doctor. You carried him across the range when he was too played out to walk, didn't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{he never}} forgets a friend," [...] {{continued}} Manuela. [...] "He has often, often spoken to me <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> dear ones, and many {{a time in}} his military wanderings has he made inquiries about the dear child who was stolen so long ago--ten years now, is it not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I'll let you stay," [...] cried Old Mother Nature heartily. [...] "I am {{glad you}} have come, {{especially}} glad {{you have come}} today, because to-day's lesson is to be <b>about</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> cousins. Now, Peter Rabbit, what are the differences between Striped Chipmunk and his cousins, the Tree Squirrels?" ...|$|E
60|$|But for all that, my dear Frankie, I by {{no means}} give <b>you</b> up altogether, <b>and</b> don't <b>you</b> make any mistake about that. It was only {{yesterday}} that I saw Charlie Scott, {{and he told me}} all <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> gave me <b>your</b> address. Don't <b>you</b> bless him? <b>And</b> yet I don't know. Perhaps you have still a kindly thought of <b>your</b> old friend, <b>and</b> would like to see her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have noticed," [...] {{returned}} the Duke, coldly, [...] "that this strange delusion of mind {{is apt to}} overtake my guests. But do not be alarmed; it will pass away presently, <b>and</b> then <b>you</b> will realize that you are yourself. Remember that I crossed the Atlantic on your steamship, signore. Many people there on board spoke of <b>you</b> <b>and</b> pointed <b>you</b> out to me as the great man of finance. Your own niece that is called Patsy, she also told me much <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> of <b>your</b> kindness to her and the other young signorini. Before I left New York a banker of much dignity informed me you would sail on the ship 'Princess Irene.' If a mistake has been made, signore, it is yours, and not mine. Is your memory clearer now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Miss Dearborn," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "don't {{think that}} I am like that man out there! Don't think that I will persecute {{you if you}} don't wish to hear me; that I will follow <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>and</b> make <b>your</b> life miserable. If you say {{to me that you}} do not wish to see me again, you will never see me again. Say what <b>you</b> please, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> will find that I am a gentleman." ...|$|R
