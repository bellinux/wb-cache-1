40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} aimed at the {{comparison}} of performances {{of different types of}} glass insulators in dry conditions, under different types of voltage waveforms namely DC, AC and lightning impulse voltages. It is shown that the <b>arcing</b> <b>distance</b> is the main parameter influencing the flashover voltage. However, the difference between flashover voltages for the different voltage waveforms reduces when the <b>arcing</b> <b>distance</b> of insulators is increased. A comparison between experimental results with those obtained by using the streamer criterion as well as those given by empirical formulas, is presented...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{artificial}} pollution tests, {{the effects of}} pollution and high altitude on the flashover performance of short samples of five kinds of UHV/EHV dc composite long rod insulators are analyzed. The exponent characterizing the influence of salt deposit density on the flashover voltage is related with the profile and the material of the insulator shed. The values of the samples ’ exponents vary between 0. 24 and 0. 30, which are smaller than those of porcelain or glass cap-and-pin insulators, namely, {{the influence of the}} pollution on the composite long rod insulators is less, relatively. Thus, the composite insulators have certain advantages in severe pollution regions. The best ratio of the leakage distance to the <b>arcing</b> <b>distance</b> is about 3. 35. The exponent characterizing the influence of air pressure on the flashover voltage is related with the profile and the material of the insulator shed and the pollution severity, the values of the samples ’ exponents vary between 0. 6 and 0. 8, which are larger than those of porcelain or glass cap-and-pin insulators. Therefore, the dc composite insulator used in high altitude regions should have enough <b>arcing</b> <b>distance.</b> Based on the test results, if insulator sample Type E is selected for the ± 800 kV UHV dc transmission lines, the basic <b>arcing</b> <b>distance</b> should be no less than 8. 16 m and the basic leakage distance no less than 30. 2 m.

50|$|Athletica {{beat the}} Boston Breakers 1-0 in their third of four final home games. With good chances on goal from both {{teams in the}} first half, the {{difference}} came when a cross from Cinalli made it past several Breakers defenders, allowing Aluko to slip a shot directly between the legs of Breakers 'keeper Allison Lipsher. Walsh almost made it 2-0 in the second half, but her <b>arcing</b> shot from <b>distance</b> hit the far post at just the wrong angle and traced the back edgeline {{back out of the}} box, where a defender cleared it. Still, with the win, Athletica clinched second place for the season, and have thus guaranteed hosting the Super Semifinal.|$|R
40|$|The arc {{behavior}} in the current zero region is critical {{in the case of}} very steep rising TRV, such as after clearing a short-line fault. Therefore, intensive and abundant short-line fault tests (L 90) of a 245 kV SF 6 circuit breaker were performed at the KEMA High Power Laboratory. For the purpose of a comparative analysis three different sets of data were obtained during the tests: 1) High-resolution measurements of near current-zero arc current and voltage were carried out. The current zero measurement system (CZM) works as a standalone system in addition to the standard laboratory data acquisition system. The arc conductance shortly before current zero and the arc voltage extinction peak give a clear indication of the interrupting capability of the breaker under test. 2) From the measured traces of every individual test, arc parameters (3 time constants and 3 cooling-power constants) were extracted for the composite black box arc model, which has been developed by KEMA High Power Laboratory and is based on more than 1000 high-resolution measurements during tests of commercial high-voltage circuit breakers. Its aim is to simulate interruption phenomenon in SF 6 gas, evaluate performance of HV SF 6 circuit breakers in testing and enable the prediction of the performance under conditions other than those tested. 3) After each test, using specially developed computer software, based on a simplified physical enthalpy flow arc model, the values of the <b>arcing</b> contact <b>distance,</b> gas mass flow through the nozzle throat and pressure inside the compression cylinder were calculated. The values of these characteristic quantities at the current zero are relevant indicators for successful interruption. In the comparative analysis, mathematical relations and statistical correlations between the evaluated parameters of the composite black box arc model and the characteristic output quantities are established and discussed. The link has been verified by MatLAB simulation of every indi- - vidual test. This approach enables acceptable prediction of interruption success in a similar circuit and with a similar interrupter without SLF tests and CZM...|$|R
