Disagreements over the program were widespread due to the difficulty in dating the homes by craftsmanship and the lack of documentation to prove it.

In the 114th United States Congress, of the 36 Congressional districts in Texas, 25 are held by Republicans and 11 by Democrats. Texas's Senators are John Cornyn and Ted Cruz.

In the end, McKinley lost by 300 votes, but the Republicans won <b>a</b> <b>statewide</b> majority and claimed a moral victory.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{announced}} his candidacy {{in a radio}} broadcast on November 3, painting the race as a choice between a free society and state socialism. Chotiner's philosophy for the primary campaign was to focus on Nixon and ignore the opposition. Nixon did not indulge in negative campaigning in the primaries; according to Nixon biographer Irwin Gellman, the internecine warfare in the Democratic Party made it unnecessary. The Nixon campaign spent most of late 1949 and early 1950 concentrating on building <b>a</b> <b>statewide</b> organization, and on intensive fundraising, which proved successful.|$|E
