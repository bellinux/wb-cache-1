5|$|At this point, a Selenite (an insectoid alien {{inhabitant}} of the Moon, {{named after}} one of the Greek moon goddesses, Selene) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with force. More Selenites appear <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> increasingly difficult for the astronomers to destroy them as they are surrounded. The Selenites capture the astronomers and take them to the palace of their king. An astronomer lifts the Selenite King off his throne and throws him to the ground, causing him to explode.|$|E
5|$|C.J., however, {{seems more}} than {{reasonably}} distressed {{by the whole}} incident. She pays Hoynes a visit {{to give him a}} warning, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> clear that {{she was one of the}} women with whom the Vice President had an affair. She makes it clear to him that, should he attempt smear tactics against any of these women, she will fight him on it, and he says he had no plans to include information about her in his book (when Hoynes' book is published in Season 6, a scene with C.J. confirms that he did not mention her in the book outside of her work as Press Secretary). C.J. later sadly relates to Toby how deeply she regretted sleeping with Hoynes. Distressed and in need of comfort, she decides to finally call her college boyfriend Ben, who has been trying to get in touch with her (and been ignored or shunted aside) for quite a while.|$|E
5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} mostly used at {{frequencies}} above the VHF (Very High Frequency) band (30 to 300 MHz). At these frequencies, the physical length of passive components {{is a significant}} fraction of the wavelength of the operating frequency, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> difficult to use the conventional lumped element model. The exact point at which distributed element modelling becomes necessary depends on the particular design under consideration. A common {{rule of thumb is}} to apply distributed element modelling when component dimensions are larger than 0.1λ. The increasing miniaturisation of electronics has meant that circuit designs are becoming ever smaller compared to λ. The frequencies beyond which a distributed element approach to filter design becomes necessary are becoming ever higher {{as a result of these}} advances. On the other hand, antenna structure dimensions are usually comparable to λ in all frequency bands and require the distributed element model.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the caps}} {{are covered by}} a peridium—an outer {{covering}} layer of tissue. After the fruit body matures and begins to dry out, {{the lower part of}} the peridium starts to rip, usually starting from small longitudinal slits near where the peridium attaches to the top of the stem. However, the pattern of tearing is variable; in some instances, the slits may appear higher up on the peridium, in others, the peridium rips more irregularly. The peridium may also rip in such a way that it appears as if there is a ring at the top of the stem. The torn peridium exposes the internal gleba. The gleba is divided into wavy plates or lamellae, some of which are fused together to form irregular chambers. The gleba is a drab brown to blackish-brown color, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> tough and brittle as it dries out. The flesh is firm when young, white, and will stain light to bright yellow when it is bruised.|$|E
5|$|Oceanic crust, {{which forms}} {{the bedrock of}} abyssal plains, is {{continuously}} being created at mid-ocean ridges (a type of divergent boundary) by {{a process known as}} decompression melting. Plume-related decompression melting of solid mantle is responsible for creating ocean islands like the Hawaiian islands, as well as the ocean crust at mid-ocean ridges. This phenomenon is also the most common explanation for flood basalts and oceanic plateaus (two types of large igneous provinces). Decompression melting occurs when the upper mantle is partially melted into magma as it moves upwards under mid-ocean ridges. This upwelling magma then cools and solidifies by conduction and convection of heat to form new oceanic crust. Accretion occurs as mantle is added to the growing edges of a tectonic plate, usually associated with seafloor spreading. The age of oceanic crust is therefore a function of distance from the mid-ocean ridge. The youngest oceanic crust is at the mid-ocean ridges, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> progressively older, cooler and denser as it migrates outwards from the mid-ocean ridges as part of the process called mantle convection.|$|E
5|$|The stable group 11 elements, copper, silver, and gold, {{all have}} an outer {{electron}} configuration nd10(n+1)s1. For {{each of these}} elements, the first excited state of their atoms has a configuration nd9(n+1)s2. Due to spin-orbit coupling between the d electrons, this state is split {{into a pair of}} energy levels. For copper, the difference in energy between the ground state and lowest excited state causes the metal to appear reddish. For silver, the energy gap widens <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> silvery. However, as the atomic number increases, the excited levels are stabilized by relativistic effects and in gold the energy gap decreases again and it appears gold. For roentgenium, calculations indicate that the 6d97s2 level is stabilized {{to such an extent that}} it becomes the ground state and the 6d107s1 level becomes the first excited state. The resulting energy difference between the new ground state and the first excited state is similar to that of silver and roentgenium is expected to be silvery in appearance. The atomic radius of roentgenium is expected to be around 138pm.|$|E

5|$|Other scriptures {{describe}} other {{visits by}} Shiva to Deodar Forest in his Bhikshatana form. The Vamana Purana mentions Shiva entering the Deodar Forest twice as a beggar. Maddened {{by the death}} of his first wife Sati but chased by the love-god Kamadeva, Shiva escapes to the Deodar Forest and lives as a mendicant. The sages' wives who come to grant him food become sexually excited at the mere sight of him. The sages curse his Linga to fall off <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> the infinite pillar. Brahma and Vishnu propitiate him and Shiva reabsorbs the Linga into his body. In another instance, while passing the Deodar Forest, Parvati notices sages who worship Shiva and have emaciated their bodies with fasts and severe vows. Parvati requests Shiva to save them from further pain, but Shiva declares that the sages are simply foolish and have not restrained their passion and anger. He enters the forest as a handsome man, wearing only a garland of sylvan flowers. He entices the sages' wives, who give him alms. As before, the Linga of the cursed Shiva falls off, but eventually the sages realise their folly and worship the Linga. Similar accounts of Bhikshatana-Shiva's visit to the Deodar Forest to humble and enlighten the false sages, Bhikshatana-Shiva's emasculation and establishment of Linga worship also appear in the Mahabharata, the Shiva Purana, and the Bhagavata Purana.|$|E
25|$|They leave, resolving {{to defend}} {{themselves}} by rebellion. Sardanapalus and Salemenes enter, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> clear that Sardanapalus is now persuaded of the plotters' guilt, but still does not repent of sparing them. Myrrha joins the king and urges him to execute Beleses and Arbaces, but he, as ever, rejects the shedding of blood.|$|E
25|$|However, {{even when}} basic and composition-dependent {{strategy}} lead to different actions, {{the difference in}} expected reward is small, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> even smaller with more decks. Using a composition-dependent strategy rather than basic strategy in a single deck game reduces the house edge by 4 in 10,000, which falls to 3 in 100,000 for a six-deck game.|$|E

25|$|Restless leg {{syndrome}} may resolve if {{the underlying}} problem is addressed. Otherwise treatment includes lifestyle changes and medication. Lifestyle changes that may help include stopping alcohol and tobacco use, and sleep hygiene. Medications used include levodopa or a dopamine agonist such as pramipexole. RLS affects an estimated 2.5–15% of the American population. Females are more commonly affected than males <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> more common with age.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} round, Memphis was first, Nashville was second and Knoxville was third. With Chattanooga {{eliminated}} and its votes redistributed, {{the second round}} finds Memphis still in first place, followed by Knoxville in second and Nashville has moved down to third place. No city yet has secured a majority of votes, so we move to the third round with the elimination of Nashville, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> a contest between Memphis and Knoxville.|$|E
25|$|When the diver descends {{the ambient}} {{pressure}} rises <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> necessary to equalise the pressure inside the mask with the ambient pressure {{to avoid the}} barotrauma known as mask squeeze, This is done by blowing sufficient air out through the nose into the mask to relieve the pressure difference. This requires that the nose {{is included in the}} airspace of the diving mask. Equalisation during ascent is automatic as excess air easily leaks past the seal from inside.|$|E

25|$|July 7 - Worried {{about an}} American {{attack on the}} coast of Spain, the Spanish {{government}} tells Rear Admiral Cámara to bring the Spanish Navy's 2d Squadron, then {{at the mouth of the}} Suez Canal, back to Cadiz. This ends the Spanish attempt to oppose the U.S. Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines. With U.S. President McKinley having pressed for it since June 11, Congress passes a joint resolution on June 6 annexing Hawaii. McKinley signs the legislation on July 7, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> official the following day.|$|E
25|$|Algebraic {{geometry}} {{occupies a}} central place in modern mathematics and has multiple conceptual connections with such diverse fields as complex analysis, topology and number theory. Initially {{a study of}} systems of polynomial equations in several variables, the subject of algebraic geometry starts where equation solving leaves off, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> even more {{important to understand the}} intrinsic properties of the totality of solutions of a system of equations, than to find a specific solution; this leads into some of the deepest areas in all of mathematics, both conceptually and in terms of technique.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent light {{fixtures}} cannot {{be connected to}} dimmer switches intended for incandescent lamps. Two effects are responsible for this: the waveform of the voltage emitted by a standard phase-control dimmer interacts badly with many ballasts, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> difficult to sustain an arc in the fluorescent tube at low power levels. Dimming installations require a compatible dimming ballast. These systems keep the cathodes of the fluorescent tube fully heated even as the arc current is reduced, promoting easy thermionic emission of electrons into the arc stream. CFLs are available that work {{in conjunction with a}} suitable dimmer.|$|E

25|$|Medawar's {{theory was}} further {{developed}} by George C. Williams in 1957, who noted that senescence may be causing many deaths, even if animals are not 'dying of old age.' In the earliest stages of senescence, an animal may lose {{a bit of}} its speed, and then predators will seize it first, while younger animals flee successfully. Or its immune system may decline, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> the first to die of a new infection. Nature is such a competitive place, said Williams, (turning Medawar's argument back at him), that {{even a little bit}} of senescence can be fatal; hence natural selection does indeed care; ageing isn't cost-free.|$|E
25|$|The main {{species of}} Coltivirus, Colorado tick fever virus (CTF), infects the Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni). This species of tick {{can be found}} in areas with shrubs, lightly wooded locations, grasslands, and on hiking or biking trails. All life stages of this tick can infect {{vertebrates}} with Colorado tick fever virus (larva, nymph, and adult). Unfortunately, mature D. andersoni prefer to feed on medium or large mammals that are walking around the knee-high plants. Oftentimes, this infection takes place when the tick larvae feed on rodents, like squirrels, that are already infected with virus. The tick's saliva then contains the virus, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> infectious for life. The adult tick then transmits the virus to humans through a bite, where it infects bone marrow cells.|$|E
25|$|Few {{deny the}} vast {{improvements}} vaccination has made to public health; a more common concern is their safety. As with any medical treatment, {{there is a}} potential for vaccines to cause serious complications, such as severe allergic reactions, but unlike most other medical interventions, vaccines are given to healthy people and so a higher standard of safety is expected. While serious complications from vaccinations are possible, they are extremely rare and much less common than similar risks from the diseases they prevent. As the success of immunization programs increases and the incidence of disease decreases, public attention shifts away from the risks of disease to the risk of vaccination, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> challenging for health authorities to preserve public support for vaccination programs.|$|E
