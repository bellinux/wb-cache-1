25|$|In {{order to}} make cross-year score {{comparisons}} possible, in April 1941 the SAT verbal section was scaled to a mean of 500, and {{a standard deviation of}} 100, and the June 1941 SAT verbal section was equated (linked) to the April 1941 test. <b>All</b> <b>SAT</b> verbal sections after 1941 were equated to previous tests so that the same scores on different SATs would be comparable. Similarly, in June 1942 the SAT math section was equated to the April 1942 math section, which itself was linked to the 1942 SAT verbal section, and <b>all</b> <b>SAT</b> math sections after 1942 would be equated to previous tests. From this point forward, SAT mean scores could change over time, depending on the average ability of the group taking the test compared to the roughly 10,600 students taking the SAT in April 1941. The 1941 and 1942 score scales would remain in use until 1995.|$|E
25|$|On 31 December 1882, at {{his house}} in Ville d'Avray, near Sèvres, he died from {{intestine}} or stomach cancer. Even though he was wounded a month earlier from an accidental revolver discharge, the injury had not been life-threatening. Five artists, Jules Bastien-Lepage, a realist painter, Antonin Proust, defensor of the vanguard who Gambetta had named Minister of Beaux-Arts, Léon Bonnat, an academic painter, Alexandre Falguière, who did his mortuary mask, and his personal photographer Étienne Carjat <b>all</b> <b>sat</b> at his death-bed, making five widely different representations of him which were each published by the press the following day. His public funeral was on 6 January 1883.|$|E

Mahla Pearlman was Chief Judge of the NSW Land and Environment Court from 1992 to 2003, {{and she was the}} first woman chief judge in any (State) jurisdiction in Australia.

Several had sporting relatives, most prominently Grant, whose brother was the international cricketer Duncan Fletcher. Audrey Palmer, a seasoned hockey official and referee {{who had played}} for Rhodesia from 1953 to 1961, travelled with the team as a medic, trainer and general supervisor. The squad left on 7 July, travelling first to the Zambian capital Lusaka and then to Luanda in Angola, from where they flew to Moscow on an aircraft usually used for freighting meat.

500|$|The episode {{features}} {{comic book}} writer Stan Lee as himself. In John Ortved's book , Lee {{stated that he}} attended the episode's table read, and {{was impressed with the}} size and quality of the creative staff, who <b>all</b> <b>sat</b> around the conference table. Lee recalled in 2009, [...] "Honestly, there was so much genuine talent around that table that you could have cut it with a knife." [...] Afterward, Lee met the writers of the show, and was pleasantly surprised to find that they were familiar with his work and he was with theirs. Afterward, executive producer Al Jean took Lee out to lunch, who he called [...] "one of the nicest and most unassuming guys you could hope to meet." [...] Lee continued, [...] "Of course, I probably said something wrong to him, or he didn't like my table manners, because I haven't been invited back for another guest shot. But hey one lives in hope." [...] The voice actor who plays Angry Dad in the episode was portrayed by Dan Castellaneta, who also does the voice for Homer among other characters in the series. The design of the character is also based on Castellaneta.|$|E

According to author and course participant, Cooke de Herrera, the Beatles were [...] "very happy at the way it was done". De Herrara wrote in her memoir that the Maharishi gave [...] "special attention" [...] to all the celebrities despite her {{warnings}} not to feed their egos. Mia Farrow wrote that she felt overwhelmed by the Maharishi's attention to her, including private sessions, gifts of mangoes, and a birthday party where he gave her a paper crown. Early the following morning the Maharishi arranged for a group photo and told everyone where to sit. [...] Since it was her birthday the day before, Mia was asked to sit in the centre and each student was adorned with a marigold garland. [...] <b>All</b> <b>sat</b> on a podium and the Maharishi had a large picture of his guru, Brahmananda Saraswati, behind him.

Photographers included Paul Saltzman, a Canadian filmmaker who was visiting the ashram after completing film work elsewhere in India.

And that was really weird for me because there's so many people of South Asian descent in America – in the world. I didn't want to be this stereotype of what Indian people are usually seen as in global pop culture. We don't just have to be Apu from The Simpsons." [...] After being given all 26 pilot scripts which ABC was filming for the 2015–2016 television season, she chose Quantico. The actress, who had appeared in over fifty films at that time, was required to audition for the first time, which she found nerve-wracking. Safran was impressed by Chopra's audition, which helped him re-envision the character, adding [...] "She walked into the room, and it was like the molecules shifted in that way that superstars have. I was very confused because I didn't know who she was, but we <b>all</b> <b>sat</b> up straighter. We're like this is clearly a movie star; it's like every {{hair on the back of}} your neck stands up watching her act. When I went back home I couldn't think about anyone else."

She then entered one of the lockers and appeared in another one on the opposite side of the stage to perform [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy". Spears briefly talked to the audience, the segment continued with performances of [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] and [...] "I Will Be There". After a dance interlude, Spears appeared onstage sitting on the magic carpet and flew over the audience while singing [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know".

[...] interlude, in which her dancers picked a boy from the audience and invited him onstage. Spears took to the stage again wearing a jacket and dedicated the performance of [...] "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] to the boy. She took off her jacket to reveal a pair of black pants that featured a sequined red heart in the back and performed [...] "The Beat Goes On".

500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by David Mould was filmed entirely in black-and-white in Plaça de Sant Felip Neri, Gothic Quarter (Barri Gòtic), Barcelona on October 10, 2003. Lee described {{the place of}} the filming during an interview with MTV News: [...] "We did it in a cool, old area of town. We shot some of it at this scenic point, and there was a rooftop where you could see Barcelona below. It was really neat." [...] The version of the song used on the video is different from the one off the record, with the band entering the song {{at the end of the}} bridge and a string arrangement by David Campbell. [...] Evanescence wanted the band version to be on the album as well, but [...] "the label was stuck on the demo and wouldn't let us use the version we really wanted. We fought back and forth about it and finally we gave in, but we were all so angry about it." [...] The video was filmed two weeks before Ben Moody's departure from the band. Amy Lee admitted that the visuals in the video were [...] "striking in retrospect", but added that the similarities between what was filmed and Moody's departure were coincidental: [...] "We shot it in Barcelona about a week before Ben left the band unexpectedly. I think none of us knew, including him, that he was going anywhere. And when we got the video back and watched it, it was right after he had left. And it's bizarre how much the video is about that. We <b>all</b> <b>sat</b> there with goose bumps, like, 'Holy crap. We've got to watch that again.'"

As part of promotion for [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy"s release as a single, Spears performed it at the 1999 MTV Europe Music Awards and at the 1999 Billboard Music Awards. It was also performed on five concert tours, the first being the ...Baby One More Time Tour (1999). The show began with a dance introduction by Spears' dancers among smoke effects. She appeared shortly after at the top of the staircase wearing a hot pink vinyl tube top and white vinyl pants with pink knee patches. During the 2000 leg of the tour, entitled Crazy 2k Tour, Spears changed the opening sequence of the show; the show started with a skit in which the dancers came out of lockers and stayed in the stage until a bell rang. They <b>all</b> <b>sat</b> until a female teacher voice started calling their names. After the teacher called Spears, she emerged at the top of the staircase in a cloud of smoke, wearing a top and white stretch pants, to perform a short dance mix of [...] "...Baby One More Time".

The song was once again performed in a dance-oriented form on the Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour (2000), while in 2001's Dream Within a Dream Tour, the performance featured Spears being captured by her dancers. [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] was also performed on The Onyx Hotel Tour (2004). For the tour, the song was remixed with elements of latin percussion.

2500|$|In 269, {{soon after}} Dura {{fell to the}} Persian army, a body of clerics {{assembled}} a charge sheet against the bishop of Antioch, Paul of Samosata, {{in the form of}} an open letter. Amongst the accusations was that Paul, who had received the civil rank of ducenarius due to contacts in the imperial court, had improperly erected an enclosure, or secretum, for himself in the church of Antioch; that within this enclosure he had erected a throne from which he presided in worship; and that he had trained a female choir to sing hymns of his own devising. [...] These practices were all condemned as innovations, improperly importing the symbols of his secular Roman magistracy into church ritual; while presumptuously and blasphemously asserting that the person of the bishop in eucharistic worship is seated in the place of Christ himself. Still in a hundred years, all bishops in the Mediterranean world had cathedrals, <b>all</b> <b>sat</b> on thrones within an enclosed sanctuary space, and all had established trained choirs to enhance eucharistic worship.|$|E
