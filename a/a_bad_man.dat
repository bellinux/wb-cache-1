5|$|In 1955, Cagney {{replaced}} Spencer Tracy on the Western film Tribute to <b>a</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>Man</b> for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He received {{praise for}} his performance, and the studio liked his work enough {{to offer him}} These Wilder Years with Barbara Stanwyck. The two stars got on well; they had both previously worked in vaudeville, and they entertained {{the cast and crew}} off-screen by singing and dancing.|$|E
5|$|MGM lent Tracy to Twentieth Century-Fox for the Western film Broken Lance, {{his only}} {{appearance}} of 1954. The picture was well received. In 1955 Tracy turned down William Wyler's The Desperate Hours because {{he refused to}} take second-billing to Humphrey Bogart. Instead, Tracy appeared as a one-armed protagonist who faces the hostility {{of a small town}} in Bad Day at Black Rock (1955), a film directed by John Sturges. For his work, Tracy received a fifth Oscar nomination and was awarded the Best Actor prize at the Cannes Film Festival. He had personally been unhappy with the picture, and threatened to leave it during production. This behavior became a regular occurrence for the aging Tracy, who was increasingly lethargic and cynical. He began production on Tribute to <b>a</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>Man</b> in the summer of 1955, but pulled out when the location shooting in Colorado gave him altitude sickness. The trouble caused by the picture fractured Tracy's relationship with MGM. In June 1955 he was the last remaining star of the studio's heyday, but with his contract up for renewal—Tracy opted to go independent {{for the first time in}} his movie career.|$|E
25|$|Although he {{traveled}} and operated his confidence swindles {{all across the}} western United States, he is most famous for having a major hand in the organized criminal operations of Denver and Creede, Colorado, and Skagway, Alaska, from 1879 to 1898. In Denver, he ran several saloons, gambling halls, cigar stores, and auction houses that specialized in cheating their clientele. In Denver, Soapy began {{to make a name}} for himself across the country as <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>man.</b> Denver is also where he entered into the arena of political fixing, where, for favors, he could sway the outcome of city, county, and state elections.|$|E

25|$|Then the debaters {{return to}} their {{previous}} analysis of Pittacus' and Simonides' poetry. On Socrates' interpretation, Pittacus claims {{that it is difficult}} to be a good man, but presumably possible. Simonides, on the other hand, claims that it is impossible to live without ever being <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>man,</b> and even to be a good man on occasion is difficult (344a45d). Simonides praises those who at least do not do wrong willingly. Socrates' interpretation is that, since Simonides was a wise man, he must know that no one does any wrong willingly; accordingly, he must mean that he will willingly praise those who do no wrong, not that some do wrong willingly and others unwillingly, only the latter garnering his praise (345d46b). Socrates thus argues that the authority of Simonides does not stand against his understanding of virtue and whether anyone willingly does wrong.|$|E

Hanneman defended himself with [...] "nothing I put in the lyrics that says {{necessarily}} he (Josef Mengele) was <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>man,</b> because to me – well, isn't that obvious?

Ah Jong is later found in the church again getting several slugs pulled out of his back showing his intense pain while the altar and cross are shown prominently behind him. The idea was influenced by Martin Scorsese's film Mean Streets, Woo stated the imagery was used to show that [...] "God is welcoming, no matter if it's a good or <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>man,</b> everyone is welcome".|$|E

500|$|Hanneman was {{inspired}} to write [...] "Angel of Death" [...] after he read {{a number of books}} on Mengele during a Slayer tour. Hanneman has complained people usually misinterpret the lyrics, and clarified: [...] "Nothing I put in the lyrics that says necessarily he was <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>man,</b> because to me— well, isn't that obvious? I shouldn't have to tell you that." [...] The band utilized the controversy to attract publicity, incorporating the Reichsadler into their logo (also the S in the band's name resembles the Sig runes used by the SS), and writing a song in Divine Intervention titled [...] "SS-3", which mentions Reinhard Heydrich, the second in command in the Schutzstaffel.|$|E
500|$|Morrison {{found that}} the locals whom he spoke to [...] many of whom remembered Murrell from several decades before [...] found the cunning man to be [...] "a white and lawful wizard, who warred against the powers of {{darkness}} with all his might"; they added that it was [...] "no sin to employ the arts of a man like him". Conversely, Maple noted that his research indicated that attitudes toward Murrell varied within the local community. Although many individuals, particularly among the poor, viewed him as a valuable member of the community, others [...] particularly among the wealthier strata of society [...] deemed him to be [...] "a dangerous quack and disseminator of superstitious nonsense". Maple found one woman, Mrs Petchey, who described him as [...] "a smuggler and <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>man.</b> He did things that wouldn't be allowed today - them witchcrafts, I mean. Nowadays, people would say he'd sold his soul to the Devil, wouldn't they? They'd put him away for his witchcrafts." [...] Conversely, Maple noted that Mrs Murrell, who was a descendent of James, described the cunning man as [...] "a good man and a regular churchgoer". According to the folklore obtained by Maple, Murrell would often have debates about Christian theology with a local parson, the Reverend Thomas Espin [...] who had been Professor of Pastoral Theology at Queen's College, Birmingham [...] and that Espin expressed the view that Murrell [...] "knows his Bible better than I do... He is either a very good man or a very bad one, and I can't {{make up my mind}} which." ...|$|E

2500|$|Molloy {{never again}} held another command. He had married Juliana Laforey, {{one of the}} daughters of Admiral Sir John Laforey, and the couple had at least three children, Charles, John and Mary. Mary married Sir John Beresford, another naval officer. In time a story began to {{circulate}} that before his marriage to Juliana, he had been engaged to marry another woman, but had behaved dishonourably. Her friends had pressed her {{to bring an action}} for breach of promise, but she refused, saying that God would judge him. The two happened to meet accidentally at Bath, whereupon she said to him [...] "Captain Molloy, you are <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>man.</b> I wish you the greatest curse that can befall a British officer. When the day of battle comes, may your false heart fail you!" [...] Molloy's actions at the Glorious First of June, and his subsequent disgrace at the court martial were then presumed {{to be the result of}} her curse. Molloy's problems with women were not over, with the suggestion that he was dominated by his wife. A short refrain appeared in print, running: I, Anthony James Pye MolloyCan burn, take, sink and destroy;There's only one thing I can't do, upon my life!And that is, to stop the d-d tongue of my wife.|$|E
