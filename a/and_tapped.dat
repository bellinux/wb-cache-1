5|$|By early 1943, with Radford's {{training}} programs established and functioning efficiently, he sought combat duty. In April of that year, {{he was ordered}} to report to the office of Commander, Naval Air Forces, Pacific Fleet where he was promoted to rear admiral <b>and</b> <b>tapped</b> to be a carrier division commander. This was an unusual appointment, as most carrier division commanders were appointed only after duty commanding a capital ship. He then spent May and June 1943 on an inspection party under Gates, touring U.S. bases in the south Pacific. Following this, he was assigned under Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman, commander of Carrier Division 2 at Pearl Harbor. Radford spent several weeks observing flight operations and carrier tactics for various ships operating out of Hawaii. He was particularly impressed with how carrier doctrine had evolved in the time since his own assignment on a carrier, and in June 1943, {{he was ordered to}} observe operations on the light aircraft carrier , learning the unique challenges of using light carriers.|$|E

25|$|In {{the absence}} through injury of Carr for {{the visit to}} Maribor, Ridgewell assumed the captaincy. Early in the game, Maribor had several shots off target, but they took a 29th-minute lead when Spector looped a casual back-pass which Colin Doyle missed entirely when {{attempting}} to clear. Dalibor Volaš picked up the loose ball <b>and</b> <b>tapped</b> into an empty net. The manner of the goal had a dampening effect on both players and fans. In the second half, Nikola Žigić and Wood were ready to come on as substitutes when King used his strength to hold up a ball in midfield and played it through to Burke, who rounded Martin Milec and shot low past Jasmin Handanović. Only Žigić came on, to replace King. Both he and Wade Elliott missed chances, Žigić heading over the bar from close range and Elliott shooting straight at the goalkeeper when clean through. In the 79th minute, a long clearance was controlled by Morgaro Gomis who touched the ball to Elliott, possibly via a defender's arm. Elliott scored what proved the winning goal, hitting a clean volley from outside the area, which Handanovič partly blocked, {{but was unable to}} stop creeping underneath him.|$|E

40|$|The {{transporter}} {{associated with}} antigen processing 1 <b>and</b> 2 (<b>TAP</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>TAP</b> 2) genes {{belong to the}} ATP-binding cassette family of transporter genes. They provide peptides necessary for the assembly of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules by transporting these peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum. As MHC class I protein expression increases with age, we have explored the effect of age on the transcription of MHC class I genes (Kb) <b>and</b> <b>TAP</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>TAP</b> 2 genes in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Blood and spleen lymphocytes were isolated from mice aged from 3 months to over 24 months. RNA was extracted and mRNA for Kb, TAP 1, TAP 2 was quantified using slot-blot hybridization followed by densitometry. There was a parallel age-related increase (1 · 5 -fold) in blood lymphocyte mRNA of these genes from 3 months to 21 months. In mice over 24 months old there was a decrease in Kb <b>and</b> <b>TAP</b> 1 mRNA, but an increase in TAP 2 mRNA. In spleen lymphocytes an age-related increase in all three mRNA species occurred throughout life. While MHC class I <b>and</b> <b>Tap</b> genes underwent very similar age-related changes, MHC class I mRNA was about 50 times more abundant than either TAP 1 or TAP 2 mRNA...|$|R

500|$|Both of his {{assignments}} {{failed to}} satisfy him: he was, according to Boia, a [...] "strange" [...] {{choice for the}} Theater leadership, and gave up on this office in April 1917; Filitti himself viewed his Prefect's job as inane, and repeatedly presented his resignation (only accepted in February 1918). His departure from the Theater was in fact hastened by the Germans, {{who took over the}} location for their own purposes. Filitti informed the troupe members that they had to pay rent, and they moved out in protest. While in Ialomița, Filitti combined his administrative missions (retold as short notes in his diaries) with historical research, <b>and</b> <b>tapped</b> into a documentary fund at Alexeni. Although only a junior member of the administrative staff, Filitti aimed for a position at the core of government, and demanded from Kostaki a post better suited to his intelligence, [...] "in Bucharest". He noted that the death of Maiorescu in June 1917 had stripped him of political support inside the Conservative Party, and had derailed his steady advancement.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Profumo's Commons statement, Ward {{appeared}} on Independent Television News, where he endorsed Profumo's version and dismissed all rumours and insinuations as [...] "baseless". Ward's own activities {{had become a}} matter of official concern, and on 1 April the Metropolitan Police began to investigate his affairs. They interviewed 140 of his friends, associates and patients, maintained a 24-hour watch on his home, <b>and</b> <b>tapped</b> his telephone—this last action requiring direct authorisation from Brooke. Among those who gave statements was Keeler, who contradicted her earlier assurances and confirmed her sexual relationship with Profumo, providing corroborative details of the interior of the Chester Terrace house. The police put pressure on reluctant witnesses; Rice-Davies was remanded to Holloway Prison for a driving licence offence and held there for eight days until she agreed to testify against Ward. Meanwhile, Profumo was awarded costs and £50 damages against the British distributors of an Italian magazine that had printed a story hinting at his guilt. He donated the proceeds to an army charity.|$|E

The scenes in which the characters ride through the air in a sleigh pulled by one of the flying sharks was filmed in front of a greenscreen. The sleigh was in fact a rickshaw which crew members rocked back and forth as a wind machine created the effect of flying through the air. As it was impossible to film underneath the rickshaw, a miniature model of the sleigh was used for the shots underneath the sleigh rather than computer-generated effects.|$|E
500|$|As {{the field}} became tightly packed, no driver had the {{advantage}} of getting the edge for moving up the field. This was the case until Rosenzweig stuck the front-end of his car down the inside of Lancaster through the Lowe's hairpin <b>and</b> <b>tapped</b> Lancaster into a half-spin. Rosenzweig's move enabled him to move into tenth while Lancaster could not recover sufficiently from the incident and lost five places in two corners. Coletti's control of the lead was waning because tyre degradation removed some of his earlier fast pace and handling, causing his lead over Quaife-Hobbs to be reduced to one second. Less than four seconds covered the first five runners with a 14-second gap over a battle for sixth place between Binder, Ceccon and Richelmi. Coletti had help from Quaife-Hobbs who was defending from Evans and by this point the track was completely dry with no rain falling. Evans made another attempt at taking second place on the final lap, almost going into the rear-end of Quaife-Hobbs's car as the pair left the Novelle Chicane. Coletti maintained the lead {{for the rest of the}} race to win. Coletti's victory made him the first Monegasque driver to win on the streets of Monaco since Louis Chiron in the 1931 Monaco Grand Prix. Quaife-Hobbs finished in second position, three-tenths of a second ahead of Evans in third and Nasr took fourth. Calado secured fifth, Binder took sixth, Ceccon clinched seventh and Richelmi rounded out the top eight points-scoring positions. De Jong, Rosenzweig, Canamasas, Palmer, Leimer, Leal, Frijns, Haryanto, Lancaster and Ericcson took the next ten places and Rossi, Giovesi, Berthon, Abt, Trummer, Bird and Dillmann were the last of the classified finishers.|$|E

The physicochemical properties were assessed and recorded as pH (6. 9 - 7. 75, 6. 00 - 6. 20 and 6. 01 - 6. 3 for river, spring <b>and</b> <b>tap</b> water respectively), turbidity (42 - 92. 0, 8. 9 - 9. 1 and 12. 3 - 14. 1 for river, spring <b>and</b> <b>tap</b> water respectively), chloride (Cl-) (7. 1 - 10. 5, 9. 5 - 12. 5 and 1. 8 - 2. 8 for river, spring <b>and</b> <b>tap</b> water respectively), thiocyanide (SCN-) (++++; +++; +), chemical oxygen demand (COD) (5. 0 - 8. 9, 7. 4 - 9. 6 and 11. 5 - 13. 9 for river, spring <b>and</b> <b>tap</b> water respectively), biological oxygen demand (BOD) (0. 60 - 0. 75, 1. 20 - 1. 67 and 21. 24 - 24. 73 for river, spring <b>and</b> <b>tap</b> water respectively) <b>and</b> dissolved oxygen DO(0. 90 - 0. 98, 1. 9 - 2. 3 and 32 - 34 for river, spring <b>and</b> <b>tap</b> water respectively). Microbial analysis was conducted based on different indicators such as gas formation by catalase activity, MR/VP test and Indole formation test. In all, the microbial analysis resulted in the presence of Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Staphylococcus and Escherichia coli in the industrial river water (river water), which showed a maximum pollution rate compared to the other two samples. Such results will definitely have a key role to ascertain the impact of the industrial effluent on Gikondo industrial Park area and any potential harmful and hazardous effects on aquatic organisms, humans and plants within that environment...|$|R
