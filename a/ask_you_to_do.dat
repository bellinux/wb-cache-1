He spent long hours registering voters and shaking hands at bus stops and movie theater lines. He took whatever opportunity came along to promote himself. He thoroughly enjoyed campaigning, and his success was evident. With the large numbers of volunteers, he had dozens at a time stand along the busy thoroughfare of Market Street as human billboards, holding [...] "Milk for Assembly" [...] signs while commuters drove {{into the heart of the}} city to work. He distributed his campaign literature anywhere he could, including among one of the most influential political groups in the city, the Peoples Temple, an organization that Milk attended regularly. Milk's volunteers even took thousands of brochures and because the Peoples Temple leader, Jim Jones, was a politically powerful individual in San Francisco, Milk encouraged Temple members to work his phones, spoke at the Temple and later wrote a letter to President Jimmy Carter defending Jones character. Milk's relationship with the Temple was not entirely similar to other politicians' in Northern California. According to The San Francisco Examiner, Jones and his parishioners were a [...] "potent political force", helping to elect Moscone (who appointed him to the Housing Authority), District Attorney Joseph Freitas, and Sheriff Richard Hongisto. (Jacobs, John [...] [...] "S.F.'s Leaders Recall Jones the Politician", The San Francisco Examiner, p.C.) [...] Milk spoke at the Temple ("Another Day of Death", Time, December 11, 1978.) and defended Jones in a letter to President Jimmy Carter in 1978. [...] (In that letter he called Jones [...] "a man of the highest character," [...] and criticized outspoken Temple defectors for trying to [...] "damage Rev. Jones' reputation" [...] with [...] "apparent bold-faced lies".) (Coleman, Loren (2004), The Copycat Effect, Simon & Schuster, p.68.). [...] However, When Milk learned Jones was backing both him and Art Agnos in 1976, he told friend Michael Wong, [...] "Well fuck him. I'll take his workers, but, that's the game Jim Jones plays." [...] But to his volunteers, he said: [...] "Make sure you're always nice to the Peoples Temple. If they <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something, do it, and then send them a note thanking them for asking you to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Swanson was chagrined at {{the notion}} of {{submitting}} to a screen test, saying she had [...] "made twenty films for Paramount. Why do they want me to audition?" [...] Her reaction was echoed in the screenplay when Norma Desmond declares, [...] "Without me there wouldn't be any Paramount." [...] In her memoir, Swanson recalled asking Cukor if it was unreasonable to refuse the screen test. He replied that since Norma Desmond was the role for which she would be remembered, [...] "If they <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> ten screen tests, do ten screen tests, or I will personally shoot you." [...] His enthusiasm convinced Swanson to participate, and she signed a contract for $50,000. In a 1975 interview, Wilder recalled Swanson's reaction with the observation, [...] "There was a lot of Norma in her, you know." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Who is <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything, Maisie? I {{told you}} how it would be. What's the use of worrying? For pity's sake don't cry like that; it isn't worth it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'm {{not very}} exacting, am I? I don't often <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} that's a bother. Won't {{you get out}} of your horrid engagement--just this once?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My property, you mean, {{that you}} stole. But I don't <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} {{one way or}} the other. I am to understand that you refuse my offer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Feel my muscle," [...] said my companion, suddenly, flexing his biceps. I did so mechanically. The fellows in gyms {{are always}} <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that. His arm was {{as hard as}} cast-iron.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] she said, [...] "I {{ought not}} <b>to</b> have <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} so compromising as {{to sit with}} me. Please don't hesitate to say so if you would rather not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are going}} wide of the mark," [...] he answered. [...] "What I have <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is <b>to</b> let the lad alone. The thing's {{exciting}} comment. You"--he hesitated--"have made enough out of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course there}} has been some fault; but Flo, dearest, listen to me. You know that I would <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> nothing from which a woman should shrink." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive me, Benjamin; I {{must really}} <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. You {{may be of}} the {{greatest}} possible use to me. Come, give way this once, dear, for my sake." ...|$|E

6000|$|In the meantime, Guy and Amy {{were walking}} in the path through the wood, where he began: 'I would not have <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} so unpleasant as reading that letter, but I thought <b>you</b> ought <b>to</b> consider of it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "Then I'm sorry I didn't <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. It's a {{shame to}} make people say whether they'll come to a garden-party from four till seven or not." ...|$|E

60|$|SIR WILLIAM. I've never <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} for me before; I expect <b>you</b> <b>to</b> pay attention now. I've no wish <b>to</b> dragoon <b>you</b> into this particular marriage. If you don't care for Miss Lanfarne, marry a girl you're fond of.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bartleby," [...] said I, in a still gentler tone, [...] "come here; I am {{not going}} to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} you would prefer not to do--I simply wish to speak to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is because}} I have much {{confidence}} in you, Monsieur," [...] he said, [...] "it is because I go--peut-etre--to dangere, to death, that I {{come here and}} <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> me a favor." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] said Conolly, looking {{round at}} her in surprise, [...] "I should have {{answered}} her question--told her what she was wanted for.

6000|$|... "Yes, it is," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "and {{covers the}} case entirely. I am here, disabled, {{and if you}} pick up my sword, as I have just <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> {{it is not to}} be assumed that your action gives me the victory.

6000|$|... "Then, do {{let us go}} outside. I don't want to {{run into}} any foolish danger--or, far more, to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. But surely if the open is safest, that is the place for us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my son, my son!

6000|$|... 'For goodness' sake,' he said, irritably, 'don't {{look like}} that. I'm not <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> commit murder. What's {{the matter with}} you? Look here, Mary; you'll admit you owe me something, I suppose? I'm {{the only man in}} New York that's ever done {{anything}} for you. Didn't I get you your job?

6000|$|... "I have obeyed your {{wishes to}} the letter," [...] he said, [...] "and I {{think that you}} are right. Up here we are entirely alone, and, as you see, they have had the sense to place the tables a long way apart.
