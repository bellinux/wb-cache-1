40|$|This chapter, first {{published}} in Japanese, outlines the field of ‘forensic linguistics’ [as at 2001]. It contrasts the forensic linguistic approach to <b>applying</b> <b>linguistics</b> in legal contexts with a different tradition of analysis: that usually known as Critical Discourse Analysis and/or as Critical Legal Studies. The author examines ‘meaning’ issues in particular, {{as a way of}} showing how treatment of specific interpretive questions exposes problematic assumptions underpinning the notion of linguistic expertise. The chapter concludes with a suggestion that, in a period of rapidly changing communication technologies and formats, notions of professional authority in respect of language and meaning may need to be reconsidered...|$|R

Applications to other educational settings developed quickly as a way to enhance writing development and the teacher-student relationship across linguistic and cultural barriers, with increasing use in second language instruction, deaf education, and adult literacy education. Since the 1980s, dialogue journal practice has expanded to many countries around the world.|$|E
25|$|Linguistic {{analysis}} is a sub-discipline of <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics</b> {{used by many}} governments to verify the claimed nationality of people seeking asylum who do not hold the necessary documentation to prove their claim. This often {{takes the form of}} an interview by personnel in an immigration department. Depending on the country, this interview is conducted either in the asylum seeker's native language through an interpreter or in an international lingua franca like English. Australia uses the former method, while Germany employs the latter; the Netherlands uses either method depending on the languages involved. Tape recordings of the interview then undergo language analysis, which can be done either by private contractors or within a department of the government. In this analysis, linguistic features of the asylum seeker are used by analysts to make a determination about the speaker's nationality. The reported findings of the linguistic analysis can {{play a critical role in}} the government's decision on the refugee status of the asylum seeker.|$|E
30|$|Chapter three, “Learning to Learn Through Language”, {{starts with}} a brief {{discussion}} {{on the possibility of}} <b>applying</b> <b>linguistics</b> to early childhood education. Research has shown a child is able to develop his protolanguage for his own purposes. A further account of children’s “language diary” shows children are also using their language to learn. Even though what factors contribute to children’s learning ability is not yet clear, children’s preschool experience of spoken language plays an important part in their education in school. Seven general principles are suggested on which children’s learning ability must be founded. The gap between children’s preschool language and the scientific discourse in school is not as wide as generally assumed. There exists a continuity between the two, the latter of which is further discussed in the next chapter.|$|R

25|$|James Paul Gee {{was born}} in San José, California. He {{received}} his B.A. in philosophy from the University of California at Santa Barbara and both his M.A. and Ph.D in linguistics from Stanford University. He started his career in theoretical linguistics, working in syntactic and semantic theory, and taught initially at Stanford University {{and later in the}} School of Language and Communication at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts. After doing some research in psycholinguistics at Northeastern University in Boston and at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in the Netherlands, Prof. Gee's research focus switched to studies on discourse analysis, sociolinguistics, and applications of linguistics to literacy and education. He went on to teach in the School of Education at Boston University, where he was the chair of the Department of Developmental Studies and Counseling, and later in the Linguistics Department at the University of Southern California. At Boston University he established new graduate programs centered around an integrated approach to language and literacy, combining programs in reading, writing, bilingual education, ESL, and <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics.</b> From 1993 to 1997 he held the Jacob Hiatt Chair in Education in the Hiatt Center for Urban Education at Clark University in Massachusetts. From 1997 until 2007, he held the Tashia Morgridge Professor of Reading at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.|$|E

50|$|The term 'panchronic' as <b>applied</b> to <b>linguistics</b> {{goes back}} at least to Saussure, who uses it to refer to the most general principles, {{independently}} of concrete facts. The panchronic program in phonology, however, is associated with the work of André-Georges Haudricourt, especially his seminal articles of 1940 and 1973, and the preliminary synthesis published with Claude Hagège in 1978.|$|R

40|$|In <b>applying</b> <b>linguistics</b> to {{the task}} of {{analysing}} how agentivity is construed through verbal interaction, scholars often equate social agency with grammatical agency, and in particular with the grammar of transitivity. The difficulty I want to address in this paper is that we may miss other important, systematic and contrastive patterning in the agentivity with which social actors and other entities are depicted, because such agentivity is realized through a range of dispersed linguistic resources. Systemic Functional Linguistics can provide a useful framework for co-ordinating the contribution of these resources to the overall construal of agency in a text or set of texts. It does this best when it focuses on bringing out the particular stratal alignments that characterise different contexts. The paper draws on a study of treatment decision-making in HIV medicine {{as an example of a}} social context where choices in the construal of agency make a crucial difference to choices of professional and institutional practice. 20 page(s...|$|R
