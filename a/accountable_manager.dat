40|$|In my dissertation, I {{experimentally}} {{examine whether}} and how the reporting model a firm uses to guide its corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosures can influence managers’ capital allocation decisions. Chapter 1 {{provides an overview of}} my research question, why this research question is important, what I predict I will find, and the main results of my experiment. In Chapter 2, I briefly review the CSR literature generally and in accounting specifically, touching particularly on what has catalyzed the recent growth in CSR disclosure, how it influences behavior, and the emerging role of CSR reporting models as well as differences among these models. Two key features that differ among available reporting models are the intended users of the disclosures (e. g., capital providers or all stakeholders) and the disclosure location (e. g., MD&A or Sustainability Report). In Chapter 3, I draw upon research in social psychology on the social contingency model to hypothesize that differences in the intended users and the disclosure location jointly influence the extent to which managers’ capital allocations are weighted toward financial versus social benefits. I also hypothesize that this influence is mediated by how <b>accountable</b> <b>managers</b> feel for financial and social performance. Chapter 4 outlines the experimental design and method I use to test my hypotheses. The results of my experiment and related statistical analyses are reported in Chapters 5 and 6, in which I find support for my predictions across two different participant populations I use as proxies for managers. Specifically, I find that participants allocate capital to social benefits across all conditions, but that their overall allocations are largely driven by financial considerations. That is, they weight financial benefits more heavily than social benefits. However, when the reporting model disconnects CSR disclosure from a more traditional financial reporting setting (i. e., when the CSR disclosures are made to all stakeholders in a Sustainability Report), participants’ weight on financial benefits is reduced. In addition, I find that these results are driven by changes in perceived accountability for both financial and social performance. I also find evidence that the influence of the CSR disclosure location is contingent on whether the disclosure audience’s preferences are perceived to uniformly favor financial benefits. Chapter 7 concludes and reiterates the important implications of my dissertation. Namely, the results of my study help inform standard setters, regulators, stakeholders, and managers about the consequences of alternative CSR reporting models and highlight the potential effects of CSR disclosure standards on stakeholder welfare.

The purpose of his team’s innovation project was to develop an automatic detection system of people by measuring body form and body heat (3 D and infrared) on a conveyer belt system. He and his team members joined the project at a late stage, inheriting the task from their predecessors. The predecessors had already performed the feasibility study and defined the scope of the project, and the new team continued from the point where the old team had left off. Along the way, several critical incidents occurred, in the form of technical setbacks to do with camera hardware, image processing and the software from an external supplier. At a certain point, the project reached an impasse. The <b>accountable</b> <b>manager</b> wanted the team to continue according to plan, because so much had already been invested and the business case still seemed valid. However, Alexander sensed that the original plan would not work and wanted to find alternative ways, exploring other avenues that might be more fruitful. He started meetings with other R&D people, organized a work session with his team, and soon some new ideas emerged, which he wanted to test. ‘A conversation of one hour with a software developer resulted in a new concept, which we explored further with the team.’ Yet the <b>accountable</b> <b>manager</b> wanted the team to continue with the original plan, which the team duly did, until a few months later, when they reached a dead end. This opened the way to present the new ideas to the management team, who soon grew convinced of the possibilities. Alexanders’ reflection-in-action was to try and change tack when he sensed the old idea would not work and a new idea seemed more promising. He consulted others on the validity of his hunches and gradually developed new ideas. He let the team prepare presentations supported by the evidence needed for the management team to be convinced of the worth of changing course. The evidence-based presentations were important to persuade both the project manager and the management team.|$|E

5000|$|Crime {{prevention}} is used throughout regulatory crime control. Eck explains that, [...] "The fact that crime is heavily concentrated on particular people, places and things {{has important implications}} for prevention" [...] (226, 2007). Use of different strategies to deter crime from happening within a facility or area helps prevent criminal activities from occurring at the particular place or area. Eck states that places that have criminal activity can partly be the place managements fault because of their particular place management practices (2012). Eck and Guerette explain that government strategies should hold place <b>managers</b> <b>accountable</b> for crime and disorder at their locations to reduce crime (2012). If place managers make the effort to reduce criminal activity within their establishment, then they become a very important crime prevention implication. Regulatory crime control, involving places, can also be prevented by focusing on place-based prevention when examining neighborhoods and large geographical areas.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Severe {{flooding}} in Queensland, Australia in late 2010 and into February of 2011 resulted in significant losses to infrastructure, equipment and coal production. Xstrata Coal (XC) mines suffered {{billions of dollars}} worth of losses, resulting in insurance premiums increasing drastically in subsequent months. These events prompted Xstrata‟s top management to reconsider {{the way in which they}} managed risk. Initial revelations were that the focus of Risk Management had largely been on the areas of Health and Safety and that, particularly in South Africa, the outcome of all management‟s efforts to manage risk had been to comply with the relevant legislation. There was clearly an attempt to avoid litigation resulting in potential prosecution. The most stringent of this legislation was that of the Mine Health and Safety Act (No. 24 of 996), as promulgated by the Department of Mineral Resources. The requirements were prescriptive to the extent that mine management was required to utilise the Hazard Identification Risk Assessment process to identify hazards, assess the associated risk and apply mitigation, largely in order to prevent incidents which could affect the health and safety of employees. Little regard was given to the fact that mining houses could endure severe financial losses as a result of catastrophic events, which could stop production for significant periods of time. Whilst Xstrata did recognise Business Continuity Risk (BCR), the risk assessment process which was introduced along with the CURA risk register displayed a distinct division between Health and Safety Risk and BCR. Furthermore, this was not a systematic process. Initial risk categories were prescribed by XC mainly based on experiences in Australia. The floods prompted a rethink and Xstrata‟s prescription to conduct business continuity risk assessments (BCRAs) coincided perfectly with this writer‟s exposure to the Enterprise Risk Management Elective at the University of Stellenbosch‟s Business School. As the General Manager of the iMpunzi Complex that comprises three coalmines, it was the responsibility of the writer to carry out the instruction to review the business continuity process. Consequently, the research is intended to assess the current Risk Management environment within Xstrata Coal South Africa by means of an analysis of current documentation and interviews with select key personnel who largely influence and impact the management of risk in the company. Thereafter, the study will progress to the methodology involved in the Risk Assessments, followed by an assessment of the knowledge, skills and qualifications required for the relevant, <b>accountable</b> <b>managers</b> appointed to manage the risks. The findings of the research were that whilst there was quite a rigid framework, which was aligned with ISO 31000 principles for risk management, there were shortcomings in the methodology of the risk assessment process, as well as the considerations for dealing with latent or residual risk. To this extent, the writer recommended: A risk assessment template which prescribes, but is not limited to, the hazards which may be prevalent on a coal mine, including hazards specific to iMpunzi Complex; A revised template for the Risk Treatment Plan, which takes cognisance of Residual Risk; Other recommendations, which may deal with minor findings of the study...|$|R
40|$|The need {{to justify}} one's {{decisions}} is a signal characteristic {{of decision making}} in a managerial environment. Even chief executives must communicate reasons for their actions. Yet, despite {{a significant amount of}} laboratory research on the effects of accountability on decision making, few studies have attempted to assess what affects accountability might have outside the lab for actual managers. In this paper, we use as subjects actual members of the professional account, research, and creative staffs of several advertising agencies in an experimental simulation of an advertising copy meeting. We demonstrate that accountability effects in complex, managerial decision contexts diverge considerably from those found in the lab. In particular, we find that accountability does not always lead managers to emphasize the most “objectively” accurate information, but instead can also encourage emphasis on information which is socially acceptable to the manager's key “constituencies” (those to whom they feel accountable, see Tetlock 1991). The social constituencies of <b>accountable</b> <b>managers</b> can differ significantly. For example, members of an advertising agency's account service or research departments are likely to favor the quantitative, analytical decision styles of their supervisors, while members of the same agency's creative department are likely to favor empathy and personal judgment. Requiring managers with different constituencies to justify their responses can cause “policy bolstering,” the tendency to favor a process of decision making particular to one's own constituency. Thus accountability may sometimes {{make it more difficult for}} a diverse group to reach a consensus, and may not have the desired positive impact on decision quality. In an experiment simulating an advertising copy meeting, we first solicited managers' private judgments of 12 ads, then presented them with research data and asked each of them to make numerical predictions of how much consumers would like each ad. The experiment manipulated the diagnosticity of the available research and the degree to which managers expected to be held accountable for their predictions. We used hierarchical linear regression to analyze the results. Hierarchical linear regression allows us to estimate simultaneously a within-subjects model capturing individual weighting coefficients for private judgment and research, and a between-subjects model of the effects of department membership and experimental conditions on these judgment-policy weights. This analysis also controls for the varying degrees of precision in the within-subjects estimates, as well as for correlations between the within-subjects weighting coefficients.. 1) Accountability had different impacts on the weighting schemes of members of account services and creative departments. Accountable research/account staff weighed research more in making their predictions than nonaccountable research/account staff. Accountable creatives, on the other hand, actually weighed research less than did nonaccountable creatives. 2) Because accountability caused subjects to attend assiduously to the research, the weight given private judgment reflected whether the data was diagnostic of the problem at hand. Accountable subjects presented with low-diagnosticity research reacted by emphasizing private judgment more heavily. 3) Accountability increased confidence in predictions; this effect was not dependent on the accuracy of subjects' predictions.. We provide several suggestions and observations regarding current managerial practices, which may improve the impact of individual accountability on decision making.

Next they analyze three often cited problems-difficulty in retaining managers, discouragement of growth investment, and complexity-that could account for the limited use of such measures. Third and last, they suggest a number of adjustments to standard capital efficiency measures that are designed to address these problems and, in so doing, to give corporate directors more confidence in using measures like EVA to reward and hold <b>managers</b> <b>accountable</b> for value-adding performance.
