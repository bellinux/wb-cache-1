5|$|All I Want Is You was {{released}} by Bystorm Entertainment and Jive, on November 30, 2010. It sold poorly at first; in its first week, the album charted at number 109 on the Billboard 200 and sold 11,000 copies in the United States. After falling off the chart for three weeks, it re-entered <b>and</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> chart for 22 weeks, before peaking at number 37 on May 14, 2011. The album became a sleeper hit, and by September 2012, it had sold 404,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.|$|E
5|$|At 21:00 {{the first}} shells of what {{proved to be}} a two-hour North Korean {{artillery}} and mortar preparation against the American river positions of 2nd Platoon. As the barrage rolled on, North Korean infantry crossed the river <b>and</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> hills in the darkness under cover of its fire. At 23:00 the barrage lifted and the North Koreans attacked 2nd Platoon, forcing it from the hill after a short fight. Similar assaults took place elsewhere along the battalion outpost line.|$|E

5|$|South of the pike, Archer's {{men were}} expecting an easy fight against {{dismounted}} cavalrymen and were astonished {{to recognize the}} black Hardee hats worn by the men facing them through the woods: the famous Iron Brigade, formed from regiments in the Western states of Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin, {{had a reputation as}} fierce, tenacious fighters. As the Confederates crossed Willoughby Run <b>and</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> slope into Herbst Woods, they were enveloped on their right by the longer Union line, the reverse of the situation north of the pike.|$|E
5|$|The highest hills are Càrnan (273m or 896ft), Hecla (Old Norse: Hooded shroud) (219m or 719ft) and Macphee's Hill (224m or 735ft). The {{last was}} named when a relief ship sent by MacNeil of Barra {{was sent to}} {{discover}} why communications from the island had ceased. A crewman called Macphee was sent ashore and returned to report that the residents had all died of disease. Fearing the plague, his shipmates refused to allow him back on board. He survived for a year, <b>and</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> hill every day {{to look out for}} a rescue. When the island was re-settled The MacNeil granted him land there.|$|E
5|$|In June 1951, Kennedy {{enlisted in}} the United States Army and signed up for an {{optional}} four-year term which was shortened to the minimum two years after his father intervened. Following basic training at Fort Dix in New Jersey, he requested assignment to Fort Holabird in Maryland for Army Intelligence training, but was dropped without explanation after a few weeks. He went to Camp Gordon in Georgia for training in the Military Police Corps. In June 1952, Kennedy {{was assigned to the}} honor guard at SHAPE headquarters in Paris, France. His father's political connections ensured that he was not deployed to the ongoing Korean War. While stationed in Europe, he traveled extensively on weekends <b>and</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> Matterhorn in the Pennine Alps. He was discharged after 21 months in March 1953 as a private first class.|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} the Raw Money in the Bank match, {{where all the}} wrestlers brought ladders. During the match, Evan Bourne {{performed}} his signature Air Bourne aerial maneuver, diving from a ladder and landing on the other wrestlers at ringside. Bourne and Miz went for the briefcase but Del Rio toppled their ladder, and Miz was taken backstage with a knee injury. The seven remaining wrestlers simultaneously climbed four ladders in the ring, but fell off one by one. With nobody left in the ring, Miz hopped down to the ring <b>and</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> ladder with one leg, but Mysterio stopped him by slamming him off the ladder with a sunset flip powerbomb. As Mysterio and Del Rio battled {{on top of the}} ladders for the briefcase, Del Rio distracted Mysterio by unmasking him and then pushing him onto another ladder, which tipped over and sent both wrestlers to the mat. Del Rio regrouped and unhooked the briefcase to win the match.|$|E
5|$|A {{year later}} Francisco de Castellanos {{set out from}} Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (by now {{relocated}} to Ciudad Vieja) on another expedition against the Ixil and Uspantek, leading eight corporals, thirty-two cavalry, forty Spanish infantry and several hundred allied indigenous warriors. The expedition rested at Chichicastenango and recruited further forces before marching seven leagues northwards to Sacapulas <b>and</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> steep southern slopes of the Cuchumatanes. On the upper slopes they clashed with a force of between four and five thousand Ixil warriors from Nebaj and nearby settlements. A lengthy battle followed during which the Spanish cavalry managed to outflank the Ixil army and forced them to retreat to their mountaintop fortress at Nebaj. The Spanish force besieged the city, and their indigenous allies managed to scale the walls, penetrate the stronghold {{and set it on}} fire. Many defending Ixil warriors withdrew to fight the fire, which allowed the Spanish to storm the entrance and break the defences. The victorious Spanish rounded up the surviving defenders and the next day Castellanos ordered them all to be branded as slaves as punishment for their resistance. The inhabitants of Chajul immediately capitulated to the Spanish as soon as news of the battle reached them. The Spanish continued east towards Uspantán to find it defended by ten thousand warriors, including forces from Cotzal, Cunén, Sacapulas and Verapaz. The Spaniards were barely able to organise a defence before the defending army attacked. Although heavily outnumbered, the deployment of Spanish cavalry and the firearms of the Spanish infantry eventually decided the battle. The Spanish overran Uspantán and again branded all surviving warriors as slaves. The surrounding towns also surrendered, and December 1530 marked the end of the military stage of the conquest of the Cuchumatanes.|$|E

25|$|Hamilcar {{noticed the}} walls were now undefended when the {{inhabitants}} flocked to the port and exploited this mistake. He sent his strongest troops to the walls with scaling ladders <b>and</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> walls without being noticed. When {{they were about to}} occupy the walls, they were spotted and attacked by Greek guards on patrol. The guards were quickly joined by other defenders, who arrived before the Carthaginian reinforcements. The Greeks got the upper hand and killed some of the attackers, who retreated. Hamilcar withdrew his army from the walls. Because he {{had not been able to}} take Syracuse that day, he decided to send 5000 soldiers to the aid of Carthage in response to the request of the messengers.|$|E
25|$|On January 26, 2005, at 6:03a.m. PST, {{southbound}} Metrolink {{commuter train}} #100 {{collided with a}} sport utility vehicle that had been abandoned on the tracks immediately south of the Chevy Chase Drive grade crossing and near a Costco retail store on the Glendale-Los Angeles boundary, in an industrial area north of downtown Los Angeles.

25|$|Carleton's {{men began}} {{preparing}} sangars {{on what they}} thought was the summit of Tchrengula. In fact the mile-long summit was divided into two peaks, and in the dark, the British had occupied only the southern, lower summit. Vice Commandant Christiaan De Wet quickly grasped the situation, and led some men on horseback to gallop to the northern end of the hill, where they dismounted <b>and</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> hill to occupy the undefended northern summit. From there, the Boers pressed forward along the summit which was strewn with rocks which gave individual Boer riflemen ample cover. The British sangars were exposed and obvious targets to the Boers, and gave inadequate protection. Like the artillery, the British infantry relied on drill, firing volleys on the command of an officer. By the time the order had been given, the intended target was safe behind cover, while the British soldiers were exposed to fire.|$|E
25|$|Carrying forward their {{campaign}} {{to build a}} temple at the site, the VHP, the BJP, and their affiliates organised a rally outside the mosque on 6 December 1992, involving 150,000 VHP and BJP volunteers. Several BJP leaders, including Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti, spoke at the rally. The crowd gradually grew more restive during the speeches, and began to shout slogans of a militant nature. Although a police cordon had been placed around the mosque in preparation for an attack, a young man slipped past the cordon around noon <b>and</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>the</b> mosque itself, waving a saffron flag. The mob took this as a signal to attack and stormed the mosque, bearing hammers and axes. The policemen were outnumbered and unprepared, and fled the scene. The crowd set upon the mosque unopposed, and leveled it within a few hours. Hindu mobs also demolished {{a number of other}} mosques in Ayodhya. The demolition triggered massive Hindu-Muslim violence across the country, in which more than 2000 people, the majority of them Muslim, were killed.|$|E
