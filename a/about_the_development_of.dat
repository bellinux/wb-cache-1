5|$|Seen {{as likely}} to provoke {{controversy}} even before its publication, Sexual Preference received considerable media attention, and reviews that were mainly mixed or negative. Critics questioned Bell et al.′s reliance upon a statistical technique, originally developed {{for use in the}} biological sciences, called path analysis, disputed the representativeness of their sample of homosexuals, pointed out the difficulty and potential unreliability of adult recall of childhood feeling and the vague and general nature of the questions respondents were asked, and disagreed with Bell et al.′s suggestion that sexual orientation is innate. Nevertheless, some reviewers complimented Sexual Preference for its authors' challenge to established views about the causes of homosexuality, and it eventually came to be considered a classic work. It {{is one of the most}} frequently cited retrospective studies relating to sexual orientation, credited by psychologists with disproving psychoanalytic theories <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> homosexuality. In 2009, the American Psychological Association credited Bell et al. with helping to discredit theories attributing sexual orientation to family dynamics or trauma.|$|E
5|$|The rate {{of growth}} of the Antarctic scallop is very slow {{compared}} to that of scallops living in warmer seas. It matures at 5 to 7 years old and spawning takes place in late summer. Little is known <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the veliger larvae but they may be planktonic for 4 or 5 months. Besides feeding on phytoplankton and small zooplankton, they may absorb dissolved organic matter and consume bacterioplankton. When they settle, metamorphosis takes place and the juveniles attach themselves with byssus threads, often attaching these to the upper valves of scallops, and remain attached for 3 to 5 years. While attached to the adult shell, the juveniles benefit from food particles in the fine detritus thrown up into the water column by movements of the adult. While studying the sizes and growth rates of adults, researchers came to realize that there were gaps in their records which were due to the fact that, in some years, no juveniles had survived.|$|E

The research respondents were the convicts and detainees in the Socialization Institution of Class IIA Yogyakarta, ex-convicts, and tattoo artists who understood <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> tattooing in Yogyakarta. The Motifs of tattoo among the convicts and detainees were flora, fauna, people portraits, horror, tribal tattoo, heart iconics, typography, biohazard and biomechanical, also still life. There were two appearances of the motif, standed alone and mix motifs. Each motif had particular meaning. The tattoing technique used simple equipment as wool, needle, and norit (a brand of stomach-ache medicine) and mechanical tattoo machine. Tattoo and tattooing activities among the convicts consist of two major functions, individual and social. As individual function, tattoo is an artwork. In this term, tattoo has a function as the expression of experiences, included {{as a reminder of}} specific experiences and body decoration. Others as a religious expression, therapy and relaxation, talisman, sex appeal, selfprotection and to cover up the wounds and other tattoo which were not good.

The H36 demonstrated the company's ambition to raise both the quality and performance of such aircraft while making them available at competitive prices. The type was relatively successful, becoming the biggest-selling motor glider in Europe and, by 2004, four separate versions of the Dimona - which were marketed as the HK36 Super Dimona or Xtreme - were available for purchase.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, the Caproni Museum was {{established}} in Taliedo, not far from Milan, by provisions of the joint will of Gianni and Timina Guasti Caproni.

The museum's original goal was to preserve the items of historical interest <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the Caproni aircraft manufacturing company, but its scope soon came to include every aspect of the history of human flight as well as those facets of art and other disciplines that had an aviation connection.|$|E

However, testing revealed that the LTP101 engines were too powerful for the aircraft; thus, following a period of re-designing, the project evolved into the Turbine Islander (BN-2T), equipped with a pair of Allison 250 turboprop engines instead. However, Fairey itself encountered financial difficulty, resulting in the Fairey Britten-Norman company entering receivership and the firm's acquisition by Oerlikon Buerle of Switzerland, leading to the formation of Pilatus Britten-Norman, at which point some production activity was transferred back to Bembridge.|$|E

Another finding {{of the study is}} that there is no causality from number of health sector tourists to health sector expenditure in Turkey. This can be explained by the economic contribution of inbound health tourism to the whole sector, which is still limited. However, the increasing trend of inbound health tourism may provide a more important contribution in the years to come.|$|R
