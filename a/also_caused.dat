5|$|The {{selection}} of The White Ribbon in 2009 <b>also</b> <b>caused</b> a minor controversy.|$|E
5|$|As an extratropical storm, Leslie {{produced}} {{winds of}} around 40mph (65km/h) while making landfall in Newfoundland. It <b>also</b> <b>caused</b> waves {{of up to}} 16ft (fivem) in height, and brought up to onein (30mm) of rain. The overall impact in this region was minor.|$|E
5|$|Croatia {{supporters}} {{often use}} flares during international matches, which has <b>also</b> <b>caused</b> sanctions {{as the use}} of pyrotechnics is strictly banned.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{penetrating}} neck injuries can <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> cervical fracture {{which can}} <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> internal bleeding among other complications.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{parasitic}} or protozoal infestations, such as toxoplasmosis, malaria, or primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, can <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> encephalitis {{in people}} with compromised immune systems. Lyme disease and/or Bartonella henselae may <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> encephalitis.|$|R
50|$|The {{variety of}} {{implementations}} for image-based gesture recognition may <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> issue for {{viability of the}} technology to general usage. For example, an algorithm calibrated for one camera may not work for a different camera. The amount of background noise <b>also</b> <b>causes</b> tracking and recognition difficulties, especially when occlusions (partial and full) occur. Furthermore, {{the distance from the}} camera, and the camera's resolution and quality, <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> variations in recognition accuracy.|$|R
5|$|For {{people who}} have already {{had a heart attack}} or stroke, taking aspirin daily for two years {{prevented}} 1 in 50 from having a cardiovascular problem (heart attack, stroke, or death), but <b>also</b> <b>caused</b> non-fatal bleeding problems to occur in 1 of 400 people.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lili's {{remnants}} brought heavy rainfall, peaking at {{four inches}} in Arkansas, to the Southeast, before dissipating near the Arkansas-Tennessee border. Lili's remnants <b>also</b> <b>caused</b> minimal rainfall in the Lower Tennessee Valley. No major damage was reported. In all, Lili caused $820 million in {{damage to the}} United States. Lili <b>also</b> <b>caused</b> a little girl to be born in Massachusetts 2 weeks before her due date. Her mother named her after the storm, Lilly. This girl has grown with the fury and intensity of this storm.|$|E
5|$|In Macao, {{high winds}} from the typhoon uprooted trees and broke windows. Flooding {{triggered}} by Gordon's heavy rains stranded cars and inundated stores. Five of the colony's six casinoes were temporarily closed. Flooding <b>also</b> <b>caused</b> the Macau-Taipa bridge to collapse.|$|E

5|$|In {{southern}} Nova Scotia, Edouard produced {{heavy rainfall}} from 3.7 to 5.5inches (95 to 140mm). Winds were moderate, peaking at 75mph (120km/h) in Cape Breton Highlands. The hurricane <b>also</b> <b>caused</b> beach erosion on southeastern Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|On October 11, a {{hurricane}} warning was issued for Bermuda, {{although it was}} replaced by a tropical storm warning later that day. However, the storm's effects on the island were limited to rainfall and gusty winds. It <b>also</b> <b>caused</b> strong winds in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|Over-hunting <b>also</b> <b>caused</b> {{a severe}} {{population}} bottleneck {{in the northern}} elephant seal in the 19th century. Their resulting decline in genetic variation can be deduced by comparing it {{to that of the}} southern elephant seal, which were not so aggressively hunted.|$|E

5|$|The firing <b>also</b> <b>caused</b> Gusev to {{be removed}} from Russia's team for the 2008 Olympic Games, though he {{originally}} intended to sue the team in time to still take part in the Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the United States, Hurricane King caused 4deaths and $30million {{in damage}} (1950USD). The {{hurricane}} <b>also</b> <b>caused</b> 199injuries, of which 16 were severe.|$|E

5|$|A {{hardy and}} {{versatile}} garden plant, B.integrifolia is widely planted in Australian gardens. It {{is a popular}} choice for parks and streetscapes, and {{has been used for}} bush revegetation and stabilisation of dunes. Its hardiness has prompted research into its suitability for use as a rootstock in the cut flower trade, but has <b>also</b> <b>caused</b> concerns about its potential to become a weed outside its natural habitat.|$|E
5|$|A rugged, sparsely {{populated}} area, the Catlins features a scenic coastal landscape and dense temperate rainforest, {{both of which}} harbour many endangered species of birds, most notably the rare yellow-eyed penguin. The coast attracts numerous marine mammals, among them New Zealand fur seals and Hooker's sea lions. In general terms the area enjoys a maritime temperate climate. Its exposed location leads to its frequently wild weather and heavy ocean swells, which are an attraction to big-wave surfers, and have <b>also</b> <b>caused</b> numerous shipwrecks.|$|E
5|$|A set {{of events}} {{similar to those}} that doomed Star Dust <b>also</b> <b>caused</b> the crash of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 in 1972 (depicted in the film Alive), though there were {{survivors}} from that crash because it involved a glancing blow to a mountainside rather than a head-on collision.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Gene caused {{widespread}} {{damage to}} several of Fiji's main islands, including Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Taveuni, Yasawa, Mamanuca, and other outlying island groups, while killing a total of 8 people. The cyclone <b>also</b> <b>caused</b> severe damage to Vanautu's Futuna island after its outerbands lashed the island with gale force windspeeds and heavy rain for 12 hours.|$|E
5|$|Deforestation has <b>also</b> <b>caused</b> {{population}} declines for {{the vulnerable}} Yunnan and yellow-billed nuthatches. The Yunnan nuthatch can cope with some tree loss, since it prefers open pine woodland, but although still locally common, it has disappeared from {{several of the}} areas in which it was recorded in the early 20th century. The threat to yellow-billed is particularly acute on Hainan, where more than 70% of the woodland has been lost in the past 50 years due to shifting cultivation and the use of wood for fuel during Chinese government re-settlement programmes.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Chiswick {{was bombed}} repeatedly, with both {{incendiary}} and high explosive bombs. Falling anti-aircraft shells and shrapnel <b>also</b> <b>caused</b> damage. The first V-2 rocket to hit London fell on Staveley Road, Chiswick, at 6.43pm on 8 September 1944, killing three people, injuring 22 others and causing extensive damage to surrounding trees and buildings. Six houses were demolished by the rocket {{and many more}} suffered damage. There is a memorial where the rocket fell on Staveley Road, and a War Memorial at {{the east end of}} Turnham Green.|$|E

50|$|Bradykinin is {{a potent}} endothelium-dependent vasodilator, leading to a drop in blood pressure. It <b>also</b> <b>causes</b> {{contraction}} of non-vascular smooth muscle in the bronchus and gut, increases vascular permeability and is also involved in the mechanism of pain. Bradykinin <b>also</b> <b>causes</b> natriuresis, contributing to the drop in blood pressure.|$|R
50|$|IBR can <b>also</b> <b>cause</b> abortion. This {{generally}} {{occurs in}} mid-gestation when a susceptible cow is infected with BoHV-1. A viraemia occurs and subsequently the virus crossed the placenta and causes organ necrosis in the fetus. BoHV-1 <b>also</b> <b>causes</b> a generalized disease in newborn calves, characterized by enteritis and death.|$|R
