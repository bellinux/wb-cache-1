5|$|Enemies, {{encountered}} in environments as icons, react differently {{depending on how}} they are approached and attacked: using the right attack or approaching them unawares grants the party an advantage in battle. If other groups of enemies are close by, they are also drawn into the initiated battle. For both player characters <b>and</b> <b>enemies,</b> battle skills and character performance can be affected by elemental attributes. Status ailments can also be inflicted by both the party <b>and</b> <b>enemies.</b> They are divided into physical ailments and magical ailments, which {{have a variety of}} negative effects: physical effects can be effects like slowing or poisoning a character, while magical ailments can cause units to turn on their allies or automatically recover a knocked-out party member. Items used on characters can restore TP or HP, or remove status ailments. Characters learn new skills during battles, along with Titles that affect aspects of characters.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Heroes of Mana features a top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures <b>and</b> <b>enemies.</b> Unlike prior {{games in the}} series, which are typically action role-playing games, Heroes is a real-time strategy game (RTS), in which the player controls up to 25 units in battles on fixed maps. Units are controlled via the Nintendo DS touch screen, selected by tapping on them and sent to destinations or to attack by tapping on their target. The game world is divided into an isometric grid, with one unit allowed per space. The Nintendo DS's second screen shows {{a map of the}} current mission, including which parts of the map can currently be seen by the player's units and which parts are covered by fog of war. Individual units <b>and</b> <b>enemies</b> are shown on the map in the visible areas.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is powered}} by an {{internal}} engine developed previously by Insomniac Games for its game Fuse. The engine of the game was reworked and optimized for the Xbox One. The game runs on 900p at 30 frame rate per second. The game originally ran at a higher definition of 1080p, but {{it was decided to}} fix it at 900p so that more actions <b>and</b> <b>enemies</b> can appear on-screen.|$|E
5|$|Adventure is a {{video game}} for the Atari 2600 video game console, {{released}} in late –. In the game, the player controls a square avatar whose quest is to explore an open-ended environment to find a magical chalice {{and return it to}} the golden castle. The game world is populated by roaming enemies: three dragons that can eat the avatar and a bat that randomly steals and hides items around the game world. Adventure introduced a number of innovative game elements to console games, including a playing area that spanned several different screens <b>and</b> <b>enemies</b> that continued to move even when not displayed on the screen.|$|E
5|$|As {{the spring}} of 1794 approached, the Committee of Public Safety, led by Robespierre, Couthon, Lebas and Saint-Just, {{exercised}} near complete control over the government. Despite the vast reach of their powers, however, rivals <b>and</b> <b>enemies</b> remained. One of the thorniest problems, at least to Robespierre, came {{in the shape of}} the populist agitator Jacques Hébert, who discharged torrents of criticism against bourgeois Jacobinism in his newspaper, Le Père Duchesne. Ultra-radical Hébertists in the Cordeliers Club undermined Jacobin efforts to court and manage the sans-culottes, and the most extreme Hébertists even called openly for insurrection.|$|E

5|$|At first, Raziel can jump, glide {{using his}} torn wings, move blocks, {{and pick up}} and throw objects <b>and</b> <b>enemies.</b> Initially unarmed, he fights using his claws, but can {{alternatively}} use weapons such as rocks, torches, spears and staffs, and the Soul Reaver. Raziel can freely shift to the spectral realm, but can return to the material realm only through special portals when at full health. Raziel automatically shifts to the spectral realm if he runs out of health. As the game progresses, Raziel gains the powers of his clan brothers after defeating them and becomes able to phase through gates in the spectral realm and climb walls in the material realm. Initially vulnerable to water, he overcomes this weakness and learns to swim.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{consist of}} both story-related boss fights and random {{encounters}} with standard enemies. Battles are turn-based, with the player characters <b>and</b> <b>enemies</b> moving around a small battle arena to perform actions. Once the player {{has laid out}} their strategy in the battle menu, the characters perform their assigned actions until the battle ends with victory for {{one side or the}} player pauses the action to change strategies. Instead of the grid-based battle system from the original Persona, party members and enemy units act in the same phase of a turn, rather than being restricted by their placement on the field.|$|E
5|$|Dava Sobel {{argues that}} prior to Galileo's 1633 trial and {{judgement}} for heresy, Pope Urban VIII had become preoccupied with court intrigue and problems of state, and began to fear persecution or threats to his own life.

Having been accused of weakness in defending the church, Urban reacted against Galileo out of anger and fear.|$|E

5|$|Like {{in other}} {{games in the}} series, Sonic {{collects}} rings scattered throughout levels; contact with certain obstacles <b>and</b> <b>enemies</b> scatters them away, and Sonic dies if he touches an enemy without any rings. Unlike previous titles, Secret Rings does not feature a life counter or game over screen, but instead Sonic reappears at the last visited checkpoint after dying, although the player will have to restart a mission if they fail a specified objective. The game contains 100 missions (including boss battles) {{over the course of}} eight levels. New missions, cutscenes, and sometimes new levels are unlocked by completing missions. Successful missions earn Sonic experience points, which advance him levels.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the series, Final Fantasy X is presented in a third-person perspective, with players directly navigating the main character, Tidus, {{around the world to}} interact with objects and people. Unlike previous games, however, the world and town maps have been fully integrated, with terrain outside of cities rendered to scale. As Tidus explores the world, he randomly encounters enemies. When an enemy is encountered, the environment switches to a turn-based battle area where characters <b>and</b> <b>enemies</b> await their turn to attack.|$|E
5|$|Most enemies will flee at {{the sight}} of the vehicle, {{eliminating}} the need for Batman to fight them, <b>and</b> <b>enemies</b> attacking the car can be subdued by its automated taser defenses. Like Batman, the Batmobile can be upgraded with new abilities. Riddler challenges also feature objectives requiring the Batmobile, such as timed races in tunnels beneath Gotham City, where the environmental obstacles change during each lap, and invisible question marks that must be revealed using the Batmobile's scanner.|$|E

5|$|Other masks provide {{situational}} benefits. For example, the Great Fairy's Mask helps retrieve stray fairies {{scattered throughout}} the four temples, the Bunny Hood allows Link to run faster, and the Stone Mask renders Link invisible to most non-playable characters <b>and</b> <b>enemies.</b> Less valuable masks are usually involved only in optional side-quests or specialized situations. Examples include the Postman's Hat, which grants Link access to items in mailboxes, and Kafei's Mask, which initiates a long side-quest to receive the Couple's Mask.|$|E
5|$|Players can use {{a variety}} of methods to {{approach}} missions. For instance, players can utilize stealth to evade enemies and complete objectives without being noticed, or they also have the option to assault enemies with firearms and vehicles. The player-character is equipped with a digital camera, which allows him to mark and highlight all visible enemies, animals, and loots. Players are also able to ride on elephants, which serve as tank-like offensive weapons. Players can throw bait towards enemies, which attracts nearby wildlife that is hostile to both the player <b>and</b> <b>enemies.</b> Players can also hunt and skin animals.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil: Revelations is a {{survival}} horror game where the player controls the on-screen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} the environment <b>and</b> <b>enemies.</b> In the game's single-player campaign, the player must complete a series of scenarios collected together into episodes. Most of the scenarios involve the player controlling Jill Valentine aboard a ghost ship in the Mediterranean Sea, but some require the player to play as other characters in different settings. To finish a scenario and proceed to the next one, the player must complete certain objectives such as solving puzzles, defeating a boss, collecting keys that open doors to new areas, and reaching a specific point in the game, among others.|$|E
