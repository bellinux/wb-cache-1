25|$|Although Burzynski and his {{associates}} claim success {{in the use of}} <b>antineoplaston</b> combinations for the treatment of various diseases, and some of the clinic's patients say they have been helped, {{there is no evidence of}} the clinical efficacy of these methods. The consensus among the professional community, as represented by the American Cancer Society and Cancer Research UK among others, is that <b>antineoplaston</b> therapy is unproven and the overall probability of the treatment turning out to be as claimed is low due to lack of credible mechanisms and the poor state of research after more than 35 years of investigation. While the <b>antineoplaston</b> therapy is marketed as a non-toxic alternative to chemotherapy, it is a form of chemotherapy with significant known side effects including severe neurotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Antineoplaston</b> {{is a name}} {{coined by}} Burzynski {{for a group of}} peptides, peptide derivatives, and {{mixtures}} that he uses as an alternative cancer treatment. The word is derived from neoplasm.|$|E
2500|$|The first active peptide {{fraction}} identified {{was called}} <b>antineoplaston</b> A-10 (3-phenylacetylamino-2,6-piperidinedione). [...] From A-10, <b>antineoplaston</b> AS2-1 was derived – a 4:1 mixture of phenylacetic acid and phenylacetylglutamine. The Burzynski Clinic website {{states that the}} active ingredient of <b>antineoplaston</b> A10-I is phenylacetylglutamine.|$|E
25|$|From 1991 to 1995, the NCI {{initiated}} multiple phase II {{trials of}} <b>antineoplastons.</b> In 1995, after over $1 million had {{been spent on}} these trials, they were stopped before the effectiveness of <b>antineoplastons</b> could be determined.|$|R
25|$|Burzynski {{stated that}} he began {{investigating}} the use of <b>antineoplastons</b> after detecting what he considered {{significant differences in the}} presence of peptides between the blood of cancer patients and a control group. He first identified <b>antineoplastons</b> from human blood. Since similar peptides had been isolated from urine, early batches of Burzynski's treatment were isolated from urine. Burzynski has since produced the compounds synthetically.|$|R
40|$|Recurrent diffuse {{intrinsic}} {{brain stem}} glioblastoma multiforme carries an extremely poor prognosis and a me-dian survival {{of less than}} 7 months. In this article, the au-thors report good results in a 40 -year-old man diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme who received antineoplas-tons. The patient’s brain tumor was diagnosed in May 1999, and he subsequently underwent subtotal tumor resection and standard radiation therapy. Magnetic resonance imag-ing and positron emission tomography scans documented his tumor recurrence. Approximately 2 months after com-pletion of radiation therapy, he was admitted for administra-tion of intravenous <b>antineoplastons</b> A 10 and AS 2 - 1 through a subclavian venous catheter by intermittent bolus injections 6 times per day using a portable pump. Administration of <b>antineoplastons</b> A 10 and AS 2 - 1 was over 655 consecutive days {{with the exception of}} a few short interruptions. The maximum dosage of A 10 was 8. 15 g/kg/d and AS 2 - 1 0. 35 g/ kg/d. <b>Antineoplastons</b> A 10 and AS 2 - 1 administration was very well tolerated with only mild reversible side effects. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging and positron emis-sion tomography scans revealed decrease and eventually dis-appearance of the tumor. A complete response was docu-mented after approximately 1 year of <b>antineoplastons</b> A 10 and AS 2 - 1 administration. More than 4 years later, off anti-neoplastons A 10 and AS 2 - 1, the patient is tumor free, able to carry on normal activities, and works full-time, and his Karnofsky Performance Status increased from 50 to 100. Extensive phase II trials with <b>antineoplastons</b> A 10 and AS 2 - 1 in patients with glioblastoma multiforme are nearing com-pletion. These trials may provide more data regarding the efficacy of <b>antineoplastons</b> A 10 and AS 2 - 1 in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme in untreated patients compared to the results in those patients with tumor recurrence after radiation therapy...|$|R

2500|$|The clinic {{has been}} the focus of {{criticism}} primarily due to the way its <b>antineoplaston</b> therapy is promoted, the costs for people with cancer participating in [...] "trials" [...] of antineoplastons, problems with the way these trials are run, and legal cases brought as a result of the sale of the therapy without state board approval.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, three oncologists were enlisted by {{the weekly}} Washington {{newsletter}} The Cancer Letter to conduct independent reviews of Burzynski's clinical trial research on <b>antineoplastons.</b> They {{concluded that the}} studies were poorly designed, not interpretable, and [...] "so flawed that it cannot be determined whether it really works".

2500|$|In June 2012, <b>antineoplaston</b> {{trials were}} paused {{following}} {{the death of a child}} patient. In January and February 2013, the FDA inspected Burzynski and his IRB in Houston.

2500|$|In 1994, a {{court found}} against Burzynski {{in a case}} of {{insurance}} fraud.

5000|$|Stanislaw Burzynski conducts {{experimental}} research on and administers <b>antineoplastons</b> to cancer patients, which are ineffective and dangerous.

2500|$|There is no convincing {{evidence}} from randomized controlled trials {{in the scientific}} literature that antineoplastons are useful treatments of cancer, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved these products {{for the treatment of}} any disease.

40|$|Unlike other {{alternative}} medicine practitioners, Stanislaw R. Burzynski has published profusely. The {{sheer volume of}} his publications impresses patients, but unless they understand what they are reading, they cannot judge its validity. To a scientist, Burzynski's literature contains clear evidence that his data does not support his claims. Burzynski's Background and Credentials Burzynski received an M. D. from a medical academy in Poland in 1967 and a D. Msc. in 1968. He did not finish a residency or train in oncology, and his bibliography does not mention clinical cancer research, urine, or <b>antineoplastons</b> during this period. Burzynski came to the United States in 1970 {{and worked in the}} department of anesthesiology at Baylor University, Houston, for three years, isolating peptides from rat brains. He got a license to practice medicine in 1973 and, with others, received a three-year grant to study the effect of urinary peptides on the growth of cancer cells in tissue culture. The grant was not renewed. In 1976, with no preclinical or clinical cancer research experience, Burzynski announced a theory for the cure of cancer based on his assumption that spontaneous regression occurs because natural anticancer peptides, which he named <b>antineoplastons,</b> "normalize " cancer cells. Since urine contains lots of peptides, he concluded that there he would find <b>antineoplastons.</b> Less than one year later and based only on these assumptions, Burzynski used an extract from human urine ("antineoplaston A") to treat twenty-one cancer patients at a clinic he opened. His shingle read, "Stanislaw R. Burzynski, M. D., Ph. D. " Burzynski's claim to a Ph. D. is questionable. Letters fro...|$|R
