5|$|Soon {{things began}} looking up for Berkman. He {{received}} word that his sentence {{had been reduced}} by two-and-a-half years, thanks to a new law. He also received his first visitor in nine years. A month later, Goldman was able to visit under an <b>assumed</b> <b>name.</b> The warden retired and his successor improved the prison for all prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The biggest off-the-field {{incident}} was revealed {{on the final}} weekend before the Sugar Bowl. Texas reserve defensive back Ron McKelvey was revealed to be using an <b>assumed</b> <b>name.</b> In reality, he was a 30-year-old man named Ron Weaver who had played for a junior-college team and a small-college team under other assumed names. Weaver disappeared prior to the Sugar Bowl, but stated that he had used the <b>assumed</b> <b>name</b> in order to gather information for {{a book about the}} inner workings of Texas football. Weaver later pleaded guilty to a felony charge of misusing Social Security numbers, but he avoided jail and paid no fine. Texas was not sanctioned by the NCAA, but Longhorns players later said the event was a severe distraction from pre-game preparations.|$|E

5|$|Edgardo found {{shelter in}} a convent of the Canons Regular in Austria, {{where he lived}} under an <b>assumed</b> <b>name.</b> In 1872 he moved to a monastery at Poitiers in France, where Pope Pius {{regularly}} corresponded with the bishop about the young man. After a year, Pio Edgardo Mortara was ordained as a priest—with special dispensation as at 21 he was technically too young. He received a personal letter from the Pope to mark the occasion, {{as well as a}} lifetime trust fund of 7,000 lire to support him.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, De Mauro {{moved to}} Palermo in Sicily under an <b>assumed</b> <b>name,</b> {{and worked for}} local {{newspapers}} such as Il Tempo di Sicilia, and Il Mattino di Sicilia. In 1959 he started working for L'Ora, a Communist-oriented paper. Other journalists were puzzled about De Mauro's presence at the newspaper: {{he had been a}} supporter of Mussolini until the bitter end and fought in the brutal war against the anti-Fascist partisans. Rumour had it that his nose had been broken by partisans.|$|E
5|$|Knox {{knew that}} the Queen Regent would ask for help from France. So he {{negotiated}} by letter under the <b>assumed</b> <b>name</b> John Sinclair with William Cecil, Elizabeth's chief adviser, for English support. Knox sailed secretly to Lindisfarne, off the northeast coast of England {{at the end of}} July, to meet James Croft and Sir Henry Percy at Berwick upon Tweed. Knox was indiscreet and news of his mission soon reached Mary of Guise. He returned to Edinburgh telling Croft he had to return to his flock, and suggested that Henry Balnaves should go to Cecil.|$|E

5|$|Many {{of those}} {{involved}} in the revolt used pseudonyms, particularly in the letters sent around the country to encourage support and fresh uprisings. They were used both to avoid incriminating particular individuals and to allude to popular values and stories. One popular <b>assumed</b> <b>name</b> was Piers Plowman, taken from the main character in William Langland's poem. Jack was also a widely used rebel pseudonym, and historians Steven Justice and Carter Revard suggest that this may have been because it resonated with the Jacques of the French Jacquerie revolt several decades earlier.|$|E
5|$|Power had {{suffered}} from clinical depression since childhood and confided her fugitive status to her therapist Linda Carroll. She developed {{the desire to}} stop living her life under her <b>assumed</b> <b>name</b> and, through therapy that included participation in the mock trial of a soldier charged with killing civilians during the Vietnam War, she began to prepare for her surrender to the authorities. This included her decision to marry Duncan in 1992 and reveal her background to her friends.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the United States in 1970, Schwarzkopf {{was awarded}} a third Silver Star and a second Purple Heart for risking his life to protect the soldiers, as well as three Bronze Star Medals and a Legion of Merit for his command performance. Still, his {{experiences}} in Vietnam embittered him to U.S. foreign policy. Upon returning to the United States, he spoke of a wariness of future conflicts to author C. D. B. Bryan in 1971: He related these experiences under the <b>assumed</b> <b>name</b> of Lieutenant Colonel Byron Schindler.|$|E

5|$|Following his recovery, Liddell {{travelled}} to Canada {{to complete}} a course at the Central Navigation School and became a pilot officer navigator. While on leave, he {{was used as a}} substitute by the Toronto Scottish under an <b>assumed</b> <b>name</b> and scored twice in a semi-final play-off. He was recalled to Moncton, New Brunswick, before the final. After some seven months in Canada, Liddell returned to Britain and, when based in Perth in 1944, accepted an offer to guest for his boyhood favourites Dunfermline Athletic. He subsequently moved to Northern Ireland for further training, where he declined an offer from former Liverpool goalkeeper Elisha Scott to guest for Belfast Celtic because of a prior agreement to play for Linfield. By the end of the war, Liddell had been assigned to 617 Squadron, helping to transport Allied soldiers back to Britain on leave from Italy.|$|E
5|$|Martin {{was arrested}} {{when he arrived}} at Changi Airport on the evening of 19 March 1995 and {{produced}} a passport with his <b>assumed</b> <b>name,</b> Simon Davis. Police had put the name on their wanted list on 14 March after they determined that Lowe had checked into River View Hotel with someone by that name. In a police interview room in the airport, Martin smashed a glass panel and cut his wrist with a shard of glass in a suicide attempt, fearing that he would be hanged like Flor Contemplacion, a Filipino who had been hanged two days before for a double murder. He was taken to Alexandra Hospital for treatment.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} marred by the revelation that a Texas player had been {{competing}} under an <b>assumed</b> <b>name.</b> Other off-the-field incidents also took place prior to the game. Because the game was Virginia Tech's first trip to a major bowl game, ticket sales were brisk. Texas took an early lead in the competition and led 107 at halftime, but Virginia Tech's defense shut out Texas' offense {{in the second half}} and Tech scored 21 unanswered points. In recognition of his achievements in the game, Virginia Tech wide receiver Bryan Still was named the game's most valuable player.|$|E

5|$|Though {{most of the}} Jews {{still alive}} in Linz after the war had emigrated, Wiesenthal decided to stay on, partly because the family of Adolf Eichmann lived {{a few blocks away}} from him. Eichmann had been in charge of the {{transportation}} and deportation of Jews in the Nazi Final Solution to the Jewish Question: a plan, finalised at the Wannsee Conference—at which Eichmann took the minutes—to exterminate all the Jews in Europe. After the war, Eichmann hid in Austria using forged identity papers until 1950, when he left via Italy and moved to Argentina under an <b>assumed</b> <b>name.</b> Hoping to obtain information on Eichmann's whereabouts, Wiesenthal continuously monitored the remaining members of the immediate family in Linz until they vanished in 1952.|$|E
5|$|When Lowe {{arrived at}} Singapore Changi Airport {{on the morning}} of 8 March, he was accosted by Martin (under the <b>assumed</b> <b>name</b> of Simon Davis), who struck up a {{conversation}} with him and suggested that they share a room, to which Lowe agreed. They managed to book Room 1511 in the River View Hotel off Havelock Road. The next morning, Martin asked a hotel receptionist to delete Lowe's name from the room registration system, saying that he had kicked Lowe out the previous night for being a homosexual. Martin checked out on 11 March and flew to Bangkok the same day.|$|E
5|$|During {{the joint}} Italian–Chetnik Operation Alfa, Jevđević's Chetniks, {{along with other}} Chetnik forces, were {{responsible}} for killing between 543 and 2,500 Bosnian Muslim and Catholic civilians in the Prozor region in October 1942. They also participated {{in one of the}} largest Axis anti-Partisan operations of the war, Case White, in the winter of 1943. His Chetniks later merged with other collaborationist forces that had withdrawn towards the west, and were put under the command of the SS General Odilo Globocnik of the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral. Jevđević fled to Italy in the spring of 1945, where he was arrested by Allied military authorities and detained at a camp in Grottaglie. He was eventually set free, having received considerable Allied support. Yugoslavia's requests for extradition were ignored. Jevđević moved to Rome and lived under an <b>assumed</b> <b>name.</b> In the years following the war, he collected reports for various western intelligence services and printed anti-communist publications. He resided in Rome until his death in October 1962.|$|E

5|$|Sheila Mae Damude {{and her son}} Darin Jon Damude {{came from}} Saanich, British Columbia, Canada. She was an {{administrator}} at the Pacific Christian School in Victoria, while Darin was a college student. They had come to Thailand on holiday, with Darin flying to Asia first before Sheila met him in Bangkok during spring break. They flew to Phuket on 15 March with Martin (still using his <b>assumed</b> <b>name)</b> who {{was sitting in the}} same row as them. He befriended the two and they checked into Nilly's Marina Inn facing Patong Beach. Martin was given Room 48 and the Damudes were given the adjacent Room 43. The Damudes were not seen again after they ate breakfast the next morning; at about 11a.m. THA (5a.m. UTC), Martin asked the inn's receptionist to switch his room to Room 43, saying that the Damudes had left and that he would pay their bill.|$|E
5|$|Using his mother's case files, Bruce finds a {{connection}} to a Southeast Asian country named Udon Khai. Using the <b>assumed</b> <b>name</b> Big Jack Hollister, Batman travels to San Francisco to meet a contact who explains how the sex tours to Udon Khai operate. As Hollister, Batman travels to Udon Khai, where he meets Rhama, a local translator hired by Alfred. Rhama shows him life in Udon Khai and how the child sex tourism has affected its population. As Batman, Bruce introduces himself to Rhama, saying that Hollister sent him. Batman and Rhama confront a man who buys and sells children and they rescue a girl who had been sold by her family. They return the child to her village and find {{that her father had}} sold her so {{that the rest of the}} poverty-stricken family could survive. The population mistakes Batman for a warrior of legend who would break the barriers that confine the population. Believing this to be their chance for a revolution to overthrow the military dictatorship, a rebel group joins Batman in storming the headquarters of the kingpin who controls the sex tourism industry. Though Batman returns to Gotham City, the rebels continue to dismantle the sex tour industry and overthrow the dictator of Udon Khai.|$|E
