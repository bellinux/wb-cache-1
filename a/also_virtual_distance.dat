40|$|Here {{we present}} {{a new kind of}} 3 D display using near zero index (NZI) {{metamaterial}} in front of a 2 D display. The <b>virtual</b> <b>distance</b> of a pixel is controlled by the refractive index of the metamaterial. As near zero index metamaterials are highly dispersive, a minor shift in the frequency can cause a big change in the <b>virtual</b> <b>distance,</b> hence enabling the control of depth with fine frequency tuning. We derive closed form expression for the <b>virtual</b> <b>distance</b> of a point source in case of lossless isotropic materials and provide a procedure to calculate <b>virtual</b> <b>distance</b> for arbitrary material with given material parameters. A double negative metamaterial working in the microwave regime is demonstrated as proof of the concept...|$|R

The information gained by monitoring is employed to optimize the use of resources in applications on mobile devices, by taking advantage of temporarily available resources at the current local area network or through ad-hoc networks. 1...|$|R
40|$|Mentoring {{can enhance}} an {{employee}} 2 ̆ 7 s career development and advancement but traditional face-to-face mentoring {{has become less}} relevant because of globalization, increased employee mobility and technology-enabled work. A new mentoring model enabled by technology has emerged {{to meet the needs}} of today 2 ̆ 7 s complex, fast changing global workplace. Although e-mentoring has several advantages over traditional mentoring, the absence of regular face-to-face interactions requires different strategies to develop an effective mentoring relationship. Moreover, additional complexities arise when this virtual mentoring is global. This research utilizes the construct of <b>virtual</b> <b>distance,</b> the 2 ̆ 2 psychological separation 2 ̆ 2 that has been found to impact performance outcomes of geographically dispersed, technology mediated teams (Sobel Lojeski, 2006; Sobel Lojeski 2 ̆ 6 Reilly, 2008; Sobel Lojeski, 2010) to understand the effectiveness of global e-mentorships. Research results support the hypothesis that <b>virtual</b> <b>distance</b> is negatively related to mentorship effectiveness measured as mentor and mentee satisfaction with mentorship outcomes and perception of impact of mentoring on the mentee 2 ̆ 7 s career. Several enablers were also identified as having potential to mitigate <b>virtual</b> <b>distance,</b> thereby improving e-mentorship effectiveness. Three of the four enablers investigated were found to be significant - mentor-mentee matching, mentorship goal clarity and technology usage, defined as partners 2 ̆ 7 access to and comfort with using communication technology. The relationship between cultural intelligence, as measured by Van Dyne et al. (2102) and mentor-mentee matching was investigated given the cross-cultural nature of the e-mentorships and found to be significant. Contrary to hypothesis, trust was not found to moderate the relationship between <b>virtual</b> <b>distance</b> and mentorship effectiveness. However, those mentors and mentees who stayed in contact after the conclusion of the formal mentoring program showed stronger relationships between <b>virtual</b> <b>distance</b> and mentorship effectiveness and partner match and <b>virtual</b> <b>distance.</b> This work makes an important contribution to the literature beyond the application to e-mentoring since one-on-one <b>virtual</b> collaboration is <b>also</b> an essential component of effective e-leadership...|$|R

The three-dimensional turbo fast echo (3 D - TFE) T 1 WI structures were segmented by FreeSurfer 5. 3. 0 software. The volume of bilateral thalami, caudate nuclei, putamen, globus pallidi, hippocampi, amygdaloid bodies, nuclei accumbens septi and whole brain were calculated. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to investigate the correlation between spatial navigation performance and subcortical nuclei volume.   Results MCI patients showed longer allocentric-egocentric <b>virtual</b> <b>distance</b> error (P = 0. 034), egocentric <b>virtual</b> <b>distance</b> error (P = 0. 004) and allocentric <b>virtual</b> <b>distance</b> error (P = 0. 011) than control subjects, while the volume of bilateral thalami (P = 0. 953, 0. 250), caudate nuclei (P = 0. 938, 0. 672), putamen (P = 0. 421, 0. 912), globus pallidi (P = 0. 446, 0. 360), hippocampi (P = 0. 545, 0. 647), amygdaloid bodies (P = 0. 565, 0. 993), nuclei accumbens septi (P = 0. 271, 0. 796) and whole brain (P = 0. 567) showed no significant differences between 2 groups. Pearson correlation analysis showed allocentric-egocentric <b>virtual</b> <b>distance</b> error was negatively related to the volume of left globus pallidum (r = - 0. 284, P = 0. 034) and left hippocampus (r =. 0. 265, P = 0. 048), and allocentric <b>virtual</b> <b>distance</b> error was negatively related to the volume of left putamen (r = - 0. 305, P = 0. 022) in MCI subjects.   Conclusions There are correlations between spatial navigation performance and subcortical nuclei volume in MCI patients, and it is significant in further study of the mechanisms of human spatial navigation disturbance.   DOI: 10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2017. 05. 009 </p...|$|R

Because active locomotion {{plays a role}} in spatial perception, cooperative viewpoint control may impact perceived distances.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new verification procedure for articulated arm coordinate measuring machines (AACMMs) {{together with a}} capacitive sensor-based indexed metrology platform (IMP) based on the generation of <b>virtual</b> reference <b>distances.</b> The novelty of this procedure lays {{on the possibility of}} creating virtual points, virtual gauges and <b>virtual</b> <b>distances</b> through the indexed metrology platform’s mathematical model taking as a reference the measurements of a ball bar gauge located in a fixed position of the instrument’s working volume. The measurements are carried out with the AACMM assembled on the IMP from the six rotating positions of the platform. In this way, an unlimited number and types of reference distances could be created without the need of using a physical gauge, therefore optimizing the testing time, the number of gauge positions and the space needed in the calibration and verification procedures. Four evaluation methods are presented to assess the volumetric performance of the AACMM. The results obtained proved the suitability of the <b>virtual</b> <b>distances</b> methodology as an alternative procedure for verification of AACMMs using the indexed metrology platform...|$|R
