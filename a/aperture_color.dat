40|$|AbstractFor {{spectral}} and nonspectral <b>aperture</b> <b>color</b> 3 s stimuli, Bezold–Brucke (B–B) hue-shift {{was measured}} {{for one to}} six subjects for four functions: (1) luminance (L) level from 0. 1 : 1. 0 through 100 : 1000 cd/m 2; (2) L ratio from 1 : 2 through 1 : 1000; (3) illuminant color temperature (for seven illuminants including A and D 65) by two adaptation methods; and (4) interstimulus interval from 0 through 40 s; the latter removes contrast effects and inverts hue-shift, so B–B ‘invariants’ become hue-shift maxima. Summary: four wavelengths are ‘invariant’ for a given L level or ratio. With higher L level, invariants shift as opposed pairs: to longer wavelength for b and y, shorter for g and r. With higher L ratio, b and y invariants shift some 10 nm longer but g and r remain about 508 nm and 493. 5 c. With higher illuminant color temperature, invariants (1 : 10 cd/m 2) shift shorter for b and y, r slightly longer (spectral to nonspectral 494 c) but g seems constant. Hue-shift data for real object color {{are very similar to}} <b>aperture</b> <b>color.</b> The full hue cycle is graphed to the recent extended wavelength scale for CIE dominant wavelength.

40|$|AbstractFor <b>aperture</b> <b>color</b> 3 s stimuli, {{the four}} unique hues, {{and at times}} the four (equally-balanced) binary hues, were {{measured}} for: (1) adapting white color temperatures 2850, 3400, 5500, 6500 K; and (2) luminance (L) for 5 and 6 log L ranges (about 0. 01 – 3200 cd/m 2) in 3. 2 : 1 L steps (viewed singly) for 1 subject per white, 3 log L in 10 : 1 steps for 6 subjects for white 6500 K, and 1 log L for 2 – 11 subjects per white. The full hue cycle is graphed to the extended wavelength scale. With higher L, unique hues *b and *y shift longer, *g and *r shorter, and spectral binaries and 460 nm are invariant wavelengths, for Ls viewed singly. But for Ls viewed in successive contrast (Bezold–Brucke effect), unique hues are practically invariants. As interstimuli interval increases from 0 – 40 s (from successive L contrast to no-contrast), invariants shift away from uniques (which become hue-shift maxima) and coincide with spectral binaries (but not r/b, 565 c) at 495, 546, 600 nm. Successive L contrast switches spectral uniques’ hue-shift off (as invariants), and spectral binaries on (as hue-shift maxima); and no-contrast switches the reverse. With higher illuminant color temperature 2850 – 6500 K, wavelength of 10 constant hues shortens 5 – 10 nm for *b, *y, g/y, y/r, but others are constant ± 2 nm...|$|E

40|$|Growth {{curves of}} the {{near-infrared}} (NIR) magnitude {{as a function}} of the aperture have been built and used to derive NIR total magnitudes from aperture data taken from the literature. By cross-correlating with optical and redshift data, absolute magnitudes and optical-to-NIR colors have been computed for some 1000 galaxies of different types. Significant color gradients are observed, underlining that small <b>aperture</b> <b>colors</b> may lead to a biased picture of the stellar populations of galaxies. A statistical analysis using various estimators taking into account the intrinsic scatter has been performed to establish relations between the colors, the morphological type, the inclination or the shape, and the intrinsic luminosity. The combination of the optical and the NIR should obviously improve our understanding of the evolution of galaxies. Despite the intrinsic scatter, especially among star-forming galaxies, optical-to-NIR colors show a very well defined sequence with type, blueing by 1. 3 mag from ellipticals to irregulars. The colors of spiral galaxies strongly redden with increasing inclination and put new constraints on the modeling of the extinction. No such effect is observed for lenticular galaxies. We also find that rounder ellipticals tend to be redder. A color-absolute magnitude relation is observed inside each type, with a slope significantly steeper for early and intermediate spirals than for ellipticals or late spirals. This stresses the importance of considering both the mass and the type to study the star formation history of galaxies.

40|$|Part I of {{this article}} found, inter alia, that chroma resembles log {{inverted}} luminance. This article develops three math models of Munsell chroma and associated colorfulness from (1) inverted luminous reflectance Y, (2) inverted chromatic luminance, and (3) inverted chromatic luminance combined (over the mid-spectrum 480 – 580 nm) with the unimodal curve for spectral absorptance of M cones. The first two models are simple but of limited accuracy and demonstrate that inverted luminance (of any form) cannot fully account for varying relative chroma around the hue cycle, particularly the minor minimum and maximum about 490 and 520 nm (which also feature in B:L functions). The third model is rather complex but very accurate, apparently the only accurate model of Munsell chroma or other experimentally based scales of relative chromaticness in the literature. It adjusts to any level of luminance or purity, as demonstrated for several levels. Three models of brightness (B:L ratio) for 2 ⁰ field <b>aperture</b> <b>colors</b> are given, based on either Munsell chroma or log inverted chromatic luminance. The former provides two accurate and simple models of the CIE B:L function: (1) log chroma = B:L ratio ± 0. 1, and (2) (chroma/k) x = B:L ratio ± 0. 1. The latter also predicts B:L for nonspectral colors and those of lower purities, e. g., object colors. The results finally solve the relationship between brightness and chroma and demonstrate that B:L ratio (a contrast in constant luminance) arises directly from chroma (also a form of contrast in constant luminance), or the reverse. 13 page(s...|$|R

30|$|Currently, {{complementary}} {{metal oxide}} semiconductor (CMOS) array is the most widespread image sensor for smartphones. It utilizes Bayer color filter arrays (CFA) that collect red, green, and blue (RGB) values from a grid-like structure. The raw data pixel values are processed through a demosaicing algorithm, which fill in missing RGB values through interpolation techniques, resulting in an RGB image. Following a demosaic algorithm, a denoising algorithm is then applied [35, 36]. Data image processing widely varies between smartphone models and brands. Along with data processing, physical properties between CMOS image sensors also vary by models and brands. Recently, Fontaine [37] released a well-organized and detailed publication outlining the different CMOS schematics among smartphone models and brands as well as the evolution of the technology over the years.

From our (U - V) half-light <b>aperture</b> <b>colors</b> and total model V-band magnitudes we construct precise color-magnitude diagrams for member galaxies out to ≳ 1 h⁻¹ Mpc. We measure well-defined color-magnitude relations (CMR) with low intrinsic scatter (σCMR ∼ 0. 06 - 0. 09 mag) {{in the cluster}} cores (Δ(U - V) > - 0. 425 mag; and (3) blue (Butcher-Oemler ≡ B-O) galaxies with Δ(U - V) ≤ - 0. 425 mag. These color-magnitude cuts provide a rough galaxy age segregation assuming blueward deviations from the CMR represent mean stellar age differences. Red sequence members are the traditional cluster old, early-types (E/S 0) and B-O galaxies have spiral-like colors; therefore, the bS 0 population {{are assumed to be}} intermediate in age. We find a significant (∼ 10 % in numbers) population of bS 0 members in two local clusters (A 85 and A 754). This is the first evidence for a quantitatively classified population of bS 0 galaxies in clusters at < 1 Gyr look-back time. The bS 0 populations exhibit the following characteristics: (1) Bulge-to-total morphologies intermediate between red sequence and B-O members. (2) Less morphological structure associated with star formation compared to normal, field spirals. (3) bS 0 members are not found near the cluster cores which suggests more recent infall. (4) Lack of a significant color gradient which is different from both the cluster red sequence and field spirals. The observed bS 0 properties are consistent with these galaxies being present-day examples midway through the predicted evolution of infalling, field spiral to red, cluster S 0 via galaxy harassment and/or ram-pressure stripping. Therefore, the existence of these galaxies provides clear observational evidence for the present-day whereabouts of the blue galaxies once prevalent in rich clusters (the B-O effect) and for environmental based evolution of the cluster galaxy membership...|$|R

Thus, LEDs excel in applications where beam quality - the main advantage of lasers - is not the decisive criteria and/or speckle are critical.

Contrary to usual laser diode spot array generators with diffractive beamsplitters this design enables individually colored spots, suppresses unwanted speckle and increases beam quality with increasing spot number. Design rules and scaling laws are established, then the resulting system is analyzed with respect to useful transmission, beam quality and chromatic aberrations. We realized a 21 x 21 spot array generator with 40 °x 40 ° FOV using a simple plano-convex lens as projection optics. A chirped lens array with varying focal widths and pre-distorted lenslet positions corrects field curvature and distortion of the projection optics.

The newly-introduced 3 D display design is usable as a multi-user display, {{as well as a}} single-user system. The wavelength-selective filter barrier emits the light from a larger aperture than common autostereoscopic barrier displays with similar barrier pitch and ascent. Measurements on a demonstrator with commercial display components, simulations and computational evaluations have been carried out to describe the proposed wavelength-selective display design in static states and to show the weak spots of display filters in commercial displays. An optical modelling of wavelength-selective barriers has been used for instance to calculate the light ray distribution properties of that arrangement. In the time-sequential implementation, it is important to avoid that quick eye or eyelid movement leads to visible color artifacts. Therefore, color filter cells, switching faster than conventional LC display cells, must distribute directed light from different primaries at the same time, to create a 3 D presentation. For that, electric tunable liquid crystal Fabry–Pérot color filters are presented. They switch on-off the colors red, green and blue in the millisecond regime.
