40|$|X-ray {{computed}} tomography (CT) provides a powerful capability of visualizing the internal characteristics of an object. The technique {{has been well}} proven as a diagnostic tool in medical applications since {{the introduction of the}} first CT system in 1971 [1 – 3]. The use of CT as a tool for industry has not matured in the same way; many unique capabilities of this NDE modality are not being utilized. The Materials Directorate of the Wright Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base sponsored the program “Computed Tomography Applications Development” to assess a variety of applications for CT as a nondestructive test and measurement technique. Several applications of CT for castings were identified as some of the most promising [4 – 6]. These applications include locating and characterizing porosity and other flaws, comparing <b>as-cast</b> <b>part</b> dimensions with design dimensions, and providing dimensional measurements for reverse engineering. This paper examines the application of CT to the problem of comparing internal dimensional measurements with critical design dimensions...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} proved that an {{addition}} of boron carbide introduced as an inoculant to the chromium white cast iron changes the structureof castings. Castings after inoculation revealed a different structure with numerous grains. Primary precipitates of chromium carbide also appeared, reducing the mechanical properties of <b>as-cast</b> <b>parts.</b> Properly established heat treatment regime makes chromium iron castings regain their, originally high, mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} proved that an {{addition}} of boron carbide and disintegrated steel scrap introduced as an inoculant to the chromium white cast iron changes the structure of castings. The said operation increases the number of crystallization nuclei for dendrites of the primary austenite. In this case, the iron particles act as substrates for the nucleation of primary austenite due to a similar crystallographic lattice. The more numerous are the dendrites of primary austenite and the structure more refined and the mechanical properties higher. Castings after B 4 C inoculation revealed a different structure of fine grained fracture. Primary precipitates of chromium carbide also appeared, reducing the mechanical properties of <b>as-cast</b> <b>parts.</b> Properly established heat treatment regime makes chromium iron castings regain their, originally high, mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|Semi-solid metal (SSM) {{processing}} routes {{have attracted}} the attention of major <b>as-cast</b> auto <b>parts</b> producers due to their many technological and economical advantages. The current overview attempts to systematically classify the presently available SSM technologies and highlight the possible mechanisms involved in evolving the SSM structures. The paper is intended more for technologists than for pure solidification scientists. S. Nafisi, R. Ghomashch...|$|R
