Bokassa claimed that Dacko had resigned from the presidency and given the position to his close adviser Izamo. He then told the soldiers that they had to <b>act</b> <b>now</b> to prevent the gendarmerie from taking over the Central African Republic army. He then asked the soldiers if they would support his course of action; the men who refused were thrown in jail. At 00:30WAT, Banza, Bokassa and their supporters left Camp de Roux to take over the capital. They encountered little resistance and were able to take Bangui in a matter of hours. Bokassa and Banza then rushed to the Palais de la Renaissance, where they tried to arrest Dacko, who was not there. Bokassa began to panic, as he believed the president had been warned of the coup in advance, and immediately ordered his soldiers to search for Dacko in the countryside until he was found.|$|E

Asked whether Chelsea could dominate for the foreseeable, Wenger said: [...] "I feel yes, because they are a financially doped club. [...] They have enhancement of performances through financial resources which are unlimited. For me, it's a kind of doping because it's {{not in any way}} linked to their resources." [...] Despite the absence of Thierry Henry, ruled out through injury, and Arsenal's poor recent record against Manchester United, Wenger believed his team were more than capable of winning the match: [...] "What is good in football {{is that it is not}} predictable. [...] You <b>act</b> <b>now</b> like it is a decade that we haven’t beaten Manchester United – it's not true. It's two games." [...] It was reported on the eve of the final that Philippe Senderos would start ahead of first-teamer Sol Campbell.|$|E
500|$|One {{reading of}} Article 14(2) {{is that in}} order to {{restrict}} the rights to freedom of speech, assembly and association, Parliament must impose the restrictions by passing written laws, that is, Acts of Parliament, since it exercises the legislative power of Singapore by passing bills that are assented to by the President. However, in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v. Lee Kuan Yew (1990), a case involving defamation law, the Court of Appeal took a much broader approach. The Court noted that according to Article 2(1), law in Article 14(2) includes the common law in so far as it is in operation in Singapore. In May 1963, the Parliament of Malaysia had enacted the Malaysia Act 1963, which extended the Defamation Act 1957 to Singapore, then a state in the Federation of Malaysia. Since the <b>Act,</b> <b>now</b> the , was premised on common law rules of the tort of defamation, the Court held that the Legislature had [...] "clearly intended that the common law relating to defamation, as modified by the Act, should continue to apply in Singapore". Thus, it is [...] "manifestly beyond argument that Art 14(1)(a) is subject to the common law of defamation as modified by the Act".|$|E
