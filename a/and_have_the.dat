5|$|A {{number of}} species of Cyathus produce {{metabolites}} with biological activity, and novel chemical structures that are specific to this genus. For example, cyathins are diterpenoid compounds produced by C.helenae, C.africanus and C.earlei. Several of the cyathins (especially cyathins B3 and C3), including striatin compounds from C.striatus, show strong antibiotic activity. Cyathane diterpenoids also stimulate nerve growth factor synthesis, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> potential to be developed into therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Compounds named cyathuscavins, isolated from the mycelial liquid culture of C.stercoreus, have significant antioxidant activity, as do the compounds known as cyathusals, also from C.stercoreus. Various sesquiterpene compounds have also been identified in C.bulleri, including cybrodol (derived from humulene), nidulol, and bullerone.|$|E

The first modern World Series was played in 1903 and, after a hiatus in 1904, has taken place every season except 1994, when a players' strike forced the cancellation of the postseason. The current American League pennant holders are the Houston Astros who won in October 2017.|$|E
5|$|Elephant ears have thick bases {{with thin}} tips. The ear flaps, or pinnae, contain {{numerous}} blood vessels called capillaries. Warm blood {{flows into the}} capillaries, helping to release excess body heat into the environment. This occurs when the pinnae are still, and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest climates, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> largest ear flaps. Elephants are capable of hearing at low frequencies and are most sensitive at 1 kHz.|$|E
