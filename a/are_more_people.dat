25|$|Florida has {{historically}} been at risk from hurricanes and tropical storms. These have presented higher risks and property damage as the concentration of population and development has increased along Florida's coastal areas.

Many Irish Terriers excel in dog agility, even though it may be hard to balance the speed, independence and precision needed in the higher levels. To date there is one Agility Champion in the US, and a handful of Finnish and Swedish Irish terriers compete at the most difficult classes.|$|E
25|$|The driving factor {{behind this}} {{is related to}} how many {{restrictions}} DRM imposes on a legal buyer. An ideal DRM would be one which imposes zero restrictions on legal buyers but makes imposing restrictions on infringers. Even if an ideal DRM can be created and used, in certain cases, it can be shown that removing the DRM will result in less unauthorized copying. For the ideal DRM, the reason why profits can increase {{is because of the}} demand is elastic. When there <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>people</b> legally buying and few people sharing the product, more profits are going to be made.|$|E

25|$|Based on {{historic}} {{migration and}} settlement {{patterns in the}} southern colonies and states, demographers estimated there <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>people</b> in Alabama of Scots-Irish origins than self-reported. Many people in Alabama claim Irish ancestry because of the term Scots-Irish but, based on historic immigration and settlement, their ancestors were more likely Protestant Scots-Irish coming from northern Ireland, {{where they had been}} for a few generations as part of the English colonization. The Scots-Irish were the largest non-English immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution, and many settled in the South, later moving into the Deep South as it was developed.|$|E
25|$|Americans of Scots-Irish, English and Scottish ancestry {{are present}} {{throughout}} the state. It {{is believed that}} there <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>people</b> with such ancestry than identify as such on the census, in part because their immigrant ancestors are more distant in their family histories. English, Scottish and Scots-Irish are generally the most under-reported ancestry groups in both the South Atlantic States and the East South Central States. The historian David Hackett Fischer estimated that a minimum 20% of Mississippi's population is of English ancestry, though the figure is probably much higher, and another large percentage is of Scottish ancestry. Many Mississippians of such ancestry identify simply as American on questionnaires, because their families have been in North America for centuries. In the 1980 census 656,371 Mississippians {{of a total of}} 1,946,775 identified as being of English ancestry, making them 38% of the state at the time.|$|E
25|$|A form {{of sexual}} {{violence}} {{on the rise in}} the United States is Human Trafficking. Poverty can lead to increased trafficking due to more people on the streets. Women who are impoverished, foreign, socially deprived, or at other disadvantages are more susceptible to being recruited into trafficking. Many laws stated in Kelsey Tumiel’s dissertation, have recently been made to try to combat the phenomenon, but it is predicted that human trafficking will surpass illegal drug trafficking amounts in the US. Women that are victims of these sexual violence acts have a difficult time escaping the life due to abuse of power, organized crime, and insufficient laws to protect them. There <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>people</b> current enslaved in trafficking than there were during the African slave trade. “Branding” of human trafficking brings awareness to the issue claims Tam Mai, the author. This allows for public assertion and intervention. A claim made in Tam Mai's article states that by reducing poverty, thus may lead to a decrease in trafficking from the streets.|$|E

500|$|English is {{the third}} most {{widespread}} native language in the world, after Standard Chinese and Spanish. It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language {{or one of the}} official languages in almost 60 sovereign states. There <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>people</b> who have learned it as a second language than there are native speakers. English is the most commonly spoken language in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand, and it is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean, Africa and South Asia. It is co-official language of the United Nations, of the European Union and of many other world and regional international organisations. It is the most widely spoken Germanic language, accounting for at least 70% of speakers of this Indo-European branch. English has a vast vocabulary, and counting exactly how many words it has is impossible.|$|E

2500|$|Because donor {{organs are}} in short supply, there <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>people</b> waiting for a {{transplant}} than available organs. When a prisoner receives an organ, {{there is a high}} probability that someone else will die waiting for the next available organ. A response to this ethical dilemma states that felons who have a history of violent crime, who have violated others’ basic rights, have lost the right to receive an organ transplant, though it is noted that it would be necessary [...] "to reform our justice system to minimize the chance of an innocent person being wrongly convicted of a violent crime and thus being denied an organ transplant" ...|$|E
2500|$|With the {{exception}} of the title theme, Fables music was composed by Russell Shaw, who had previously worked on Molyneux games such as Magic Carpet and Black & White. The job for composing Fables theme music was given to Danny Elfman. Elfman noted in an interview that Hollywood composers did not typically cross over to video game work, in part because many game developers wanted a synthesised score that sounds like an orchestra, instead of the real thing. [...] At Elfman's insistence, the developers used a small orchestra, which Shaw noted was much more of a challenge than previous projects; [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>people</b> involved (even without considering the orchestra), and the complexities of any music interactivity are brought to the fore." ...|$|E
