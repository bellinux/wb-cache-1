5|$|By {{the time}} French lookouts at Santo Domingo had spotted Duckworth {{approaching}} from the southeast, {{it was too}} late for Leissègues to escape. Sailing with the wind westwards along the coast, Leissègues formed a line of battle to meet the approaching British squadron, which had split into two divisions. Although his divisions separated during the approach, Duckworth's lead ships remained in a tight formation and successfully engaged the head of the French line, targeting the flagship Impérial. Under pressure, the French squadron broke apart with the British isolating and capturing three ships before concentrating on the main combat around the French flagship. Severely damaged and surrounded, Leissègues drove Impérial ashore to avoid capture. The remaining French ship of the line, Diomède, followed him. Although most of the crew of these ships scrambled ashore, British boarding parties captured both vessels <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>them</b> on fire. The only French ships to escape the battle were three smaller warships, which Duckworth's squadron had ignored; they eventually returned to France.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the Spanish missionary Fray Alonso de León {{reported}} that about eighty families in San Mateo Ixtatán {{did not pay}} tribute to the Spanish Crown or attend the Roman Catholic mass. He described the inhabitants as quarrelsome and complained that they had built a pagan shrine in the hills among the ruins of pre-Columbian temples, where they burnt incense and offerings and sacrificed turkeys. He reported that every March they built bonfires around wooden crosses about two leagues from the town <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>them</b> on fire. Fray de León informed the colonial authorities that the practices of the natives were such that they were Christian in name only. Eventually, Fray de León was chased out of San Mateo Ixtatán by the locals.|$|E

The remaining Mew Mews continue {{to eliminate the}} Chimera Animas {{left behind by the}} aliens. They face a new threat {{in the form of the}} Saint Rose Crusaders: humans with special powers who desire to conquer the world and create a utopia while taking over the remaining Chimera Animas. Berry Shirayuki becomes the sixth Mew Mew and temporarily takes Ichigo's place as the leader. Berry is the first Mew Mew to be infused with the DNA of two endangered species, the Andean mountain cat and the Amami rabbit. As one of the strongest Mew Mews, Berry is targeted by two of the Crusaders, who attack her at school. Ichigo returns to provide assistance during this battle. For their final attack, two Crusaders hypnotize the citizens of Tokyo <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>them</b> against the Mew Mews. Berry and her childhood friend Tasuku Meguro use their new-found feelings of love to reverse the hypnosis and cause a change of heart in the Crusaders.|$|E
5|$|On 11 March 1970 a large protest {{took place}} outside the North Vietnamese and PRGSV embassies, as protesters demanded Viet Cong troops {{withdraw}} from Cambodia. The protests turned chaotic, as protesters looted both embassies <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>them</b> on fire, alarming Sihanouk. Sihanouk, {{who was in}} Paris at the time, contemplated between returning to quell the situation, and visiting Moscow, Beijing, and Hanoi. He opted for the latter, thinking that he could persuade its leaders to recall Viet Cong troops to their jungle sanctuaries, where they had originally established themselves between 1964 and 1969. Five days later, Oum Mannorine, the half-brother of Sihanouk's wife Monique, was summoned to the National Assembly to answer corruption charges. On that night after the hearing, Mannorine ordered troops under his command to arrest Lon Nol and Sirik Matak, but ended up getting arrested by Lon Nol's troops instead. On 18March 1970 the National Assembly voted to depose Sihanouk, allowing Lon Nol to assume emergency powers.|$|E

Early temples were built of brick and other perishable materials, and most of the outlying buildings in temple enclosures remained brick-built throughout Egyptian history. The main stones used in temple construction were limestone and sandstone, which are common in Egypt; stones that are harder and more difficult to carve, such as granite, were used in smaller amounts for individual elements like obelisks. The stone to build a temple might be quarried nearby or shipped on the Nile from quarries elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The Johnson County War, {{with its}} overtones of class warfare {{coupled with the}} {{intervention}} ordered by the President of the United States to {{save the lives of}} a gang of hired killers <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>them</b> free, is not a flattering reflection on the American myth of the west. The Johnson County War {{has been one of the}} best-known range wars of the frontier. It has been a popular feature of the Western genre of fiction, which includes literature, films and television shows. The Banditti of the Plains, written in 1894 by witness Asa Shinn Mercer, is the earliest record of the Johnson County War. The book was suppressed for many years by the WSGA, who seized and destroyed all but a few of the first edition copies from the 1894 printing; they were rumored to have hijacked and destroyed the second printing as it was being shipped from a printer north of Denver, Colorado. The book was reprinted several times in the 20th century and most recently in 2015. Frances McElrath's novel 1902 The Rustler, took inspiration from the Johnson County War, and was sympathetic to the perspective of the small ranchers.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1830s, liberal and radical boyars, {{many of whom}} studied in Western Europe, {{particularly}} in Paris, had taken the first steps toward the anti-slavery goal. During that period, Ion Câmpineanu, like the landowning brothers Nicolae and Ştefan Golescu, emancipated all his slave retinue, while boyar Emanoil Bălăceanu freed his slaves and organized for them the Scăieni Phalanstery, an utopian socialist community. In 1836, Wallachian Prince Alexandru II Ghica freed 4,000 domneşti slaves and had a group of landowners sign them up as paid workforce, while instigating a policy through which the state purchased privately owned slaves <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>them</b> free.|$|E
25|$|The Clemson University {{alma mater}} {{originated}} in the 1910s after a group of Clemson ROTC cadets in May 1918 was asked to sing the school's song at a gathering of ROTC cadets in Plattsburg, New York; {{they were unable to}} do so, as Clemson had no song at the time. One of the cadets in attendance, A.C. Corcoran of Charleston, South Carolina, decided to remedy the situation and wrote the words to the alma mater <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>them</b> to Annie Lisle, which was the melody of Cornell University's alma mater, as well as many others. The words were later officially accepted by the then-named Clemson Agricultural College as the alma mater and was first performed by the Clemson Glee Club on February 17, 1919.|$|E
25|$|Unlike in {{classical}} Antiquity, the warships of the 6th century did not feature rams; naval combat was therefore dominated by missile exchanges and boarding actions. In {{this form of}} combat, experience {{and the ability to}} maintain a formation of ships was essential, and the Byzantine crews held the advantage over the inexperienced Goths. Soon, in the heat of battle, some Gothic ships drifted off the main body and were easily destroyed, while others sailed too close together and were unable to maneuver. In the end, the weary Gothic fleet disintegrated and their ships fled as best as they could. They lost 36 ships, and Gibal was captured, while Indulf with the remainder fled towards Ancona. As soon as he came close to the Gothic army's camp, he beached his ships <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>them</b> on fire.|$|E

Shortly before their first tour as The Dillinger Escape Plan, Brantley left the group {{and was replaced by}} John Fulton. During this time period, The Dillinger Escape Plan gained notoriety in the hardcore punk scene for the intensity of their performances. Their performances were increasingly wild, and often violent. These elaborate performances, as well as the creative, technical approach of their music led a record executive of Relapse Records to offer the band a multi-record contract. The band agreed to the contract, and recorded their second EP with Relapse titled Under the Running Board. Shortly after its release, Fulton left the band over creative differences. The three-song EP release served to bolster anticipation for their 1999 full-length release, Calculating Infinity.|$|E
25|$|The Cougars first {{match of}} the MVC Championships was a rematch of last Saturday's MVC finale versus Loyola. As {{in the first}} meeting, the game was an epic {{struggle}} between the two top defenses in the Valley. In the first half, the Cougars' offense outshot the Ramblers 8–2, while in the second half, Loyola's offense came to the fore, leading 6 shots to 3. Both goalkeepers and their defenders, {{among the best in}} the NCAA, kept clean sheets through regulation time. SIUE seemed to gain an advantage when Loyola went a man down due to a red card in the 86th minute, but the Ramblers continued to force the action, and the Cougars were unable to formulate an effective offensive plan. As in the teams' first meeting, the game went into golden goal extra time tied 0–0, and, after two ten-minute overtimes, the tie still stood, leaving the result to a penalty shoot-out. Both teams made their first three shots count, then both missed the fourth with high shots. Loyola's fifth shot was up to the MVC Player of the Year, who also missed high. The Cougars' team captain Ledbetter then fired a shot right down the middle, past the Loyola keeper to give the Cougars the win <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>them</b> up to defend their tournament championship in the Sunday title game.|$|E
