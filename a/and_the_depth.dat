5|$|Decompression {{which follows}} the {{procedure}} of relatively fast ascent interrupted by periods at constant depth {{is known as}} staged decompression. The ascent rate <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> and duration of the stops are integral parts of the decompression process. The advantage of staged decompression {{is that it is}} far easier to monitor and control than continuous decompression.|$|E
5|$|Several cultivars of P.atriplicifolia {{have been}} developed. They are {{primarily}} distinguished by {{the height of}} mature plants <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> of the leaf-margin incisions. Many of these cultivars, especially those with deeply incised leaves, may actually be hybrids of P.atriplicifolia and P.abrotanoides. In that context, some may be referred to by the hybrid name P. ×hybrida.|$|E

5|$|The game {{received}} wide critical acclaim, {{being compared}} favorably to Civilization II. Critics praised its science fiction storyline (comparing the plot to works by Stanley Kubrick, Frank Herbert, Arthur C.

5|$|A similar {{initiative}} {{came from}} Norman Pierre Gentieu (1914–2009), an American writer who discovered Sorabji by reading his book Around Music {{just after the}} Second World War. Because of the post-war shortages in England, Gentieu sent Sorabji some provisions, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> of their friendship {{appears to have been}} such that he continued to do so for the next four decades. In the early 1950s Gentieu made an offer to Sorabji to pay for the microfilming of his major piano works and to give some copies to selected libraries. All of his unpublished musical manuscripts were eventually microfilmed. Gentieu also sent Sorabji a tape recorder to record some of his music, but Sorabji did not do so.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the attack, none aboard Centaur {{witnessed}} what had attacked the ship. Due to the ship's position, the distance from shore, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth,</b> it was concluded that she was torpedoed by one of the Japanese submarines known to be operating off the Australian east coast. Several survivors later claimed to have heard the attacking submarine moving on the surface while they were adrift, and the submarine was seen by the ship's cook, Francis Martin, who was floating alone on a hatch cover, out of sight from the main cluster of survivors. Martin described the submarine to Naval Intelligence following the survivors' return to land; his description matched the profile of a KD7 type Kaidai-class submarine of the Imperial Japanese Navy.|$|E

5|$|Eleven {{percent of}} Nescopeck Creek's {{watershed}} {{is made up}} of the Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia series. There is some urban development over lands containing the soil series. Other areas where this soil series occurs have been surface-mined. The limiting factor for plant growth in this series is the rocky surface <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> of the bedrock below. The Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia soil series occurs in the southeastern and parts of the southwestern parts of the Nescopeck Creek watershed. The Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris series is present in nine percent of Nescopeck Creek's watershed. The Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris soil series mostly is near Nescopeck Creek's source, but there is some of it in the central Nescopeck Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|Torpedo {{capability}} {{was always}} considered paramount. The lack of suitable aircraft and shortage {{of the weapon}} itself resulted in the strike arm of Coastal Command being severely handicapped. As late as 10 December 1941 the torpedo resources {{were given to the}} Fleet Air Arm (FAA) which would receive 75 percent of all torpedoes. Torpedoes were sensitive and highly costly in production terms. The weather conditions off enemy coasts made their use more complicated <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> of the water was considered too shallow. It was also uneconomical to use the weapon against low-tonnage shipping, Coastal Command's main target. Aside from that, the Beaufort torpedo-bomber was being posted overseas from August 1941 onwards.|$|E
5|$|With {{the arrival}} of fresh supplies, Hurdt and Amangkurat were emboldened {{to find ways to}} cross the river. Forces led by Dutch {{commander}} Isaac de Saint Martin drove Trunajaya's forces from Manukan, on the west bank further south from Singkal. They tried to cross the river there, but were unsuccessful due to heavy opposing fire <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> of the water. They made another attempt on the night of 6–7 November, but their boats were sunk and it failed too. Hurdt was frustrated by the lack of progress, and gave Amangkurat an ultimatum that the VOC would withdraw unless the king supplied pontoons for the crossing, and matches for its soldiers's matchlocks.|$|E

5|$|The known {{material}} (hypodigm) of Miniopterus zapfei {{includes a}} mandible (lower jaw) with the fourth premolar (p4), first molar (m1), and second molar (m2); a mandible with m1; a mandible with m1 and m2; a mandible with m2 {{and the third}} molar (m3); a mandible without any teeth; and an isolated fourth upper premolar (P4). Some of the mandibles also preserve the alveoli (openings) for teeth {{that have not been}} preserved. The dimensions of the p4 (length and width) are 1.03 x 0.88mm; m1 is 1.57 to 1.60 x 1.01 to 1.07mm; m2 is 1.51 to 1.64 x 0.95 to 1.05mm; the single m3 is 1.41mm long; and the single P4 is 1.38 x 1.52mm. In a well-preserved mandible, the length from the alveolus for the first incisor to the end of m3 is 8.80mm <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> of the mandible at m1 is 1.50mm.|$|E
