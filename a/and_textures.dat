5|$|A remastered {{version of}} the game was {{released}} in June 2015 as Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition, which adds both English and Japanese voice tracks, improved visual effects <b>and</b> <b>textures,</b> in-game re-balancing, additional costumes, and 3 bonus playable characters: Vergil, returning from , Trish, playable {{for the first time}} since Devil May Cry 2, and Lady, who makes her playable debut.|$|E
5|$|For the CGI {{compositions}} of the Vale of Arryn, {{as seen in}} the {{establishing shot}} of the Eyrie and from the sky cells, the visual effects team used images <b>and</b> <b>textures</b> from the Greek rock formations of Meteora. Initially they had been considering the Zhangjiajie Mountains in China, but because the landscape base plates were being shot in Ireland, using Meteora was a better option.|$|E
5|$|Tomorrow's Modern Boxes is {{the second}} solo album by Thom Yorke of the English {{alternative}} rock band Radiohead, released on 26 September 2014. It was produced by Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, with artwork by Radiohead artist Stanley Donwood. The album blends Yorke's vocals and piano playing with electronic beats <b>and</b> <b>textures.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Redundant Discrete Wavelet Transform (RDWT) and Wavelet Atomic Transform (WAT) are {{proposed}} {{in this paper}} as a couple of dictionaries to get the structure <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> basing on morphological component decomposition. Then, basing {{on the fact that}} the structure <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> have different characteristics, in this paper we use curvature driven diffusion model <b>and</b> Criminisi <b>texture</b> synthesis method to inpaint the structure <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> respectively. At last, compound the inpainted structure <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> get the inpainting result. The experiment results show the new method can not only decompose the image very well, but also inpaint the image with strong and fairing edge, complete <b>and</b> clear <b>texture.</b> This method shows better results in image inpainting compared to the classical ones...|$|R
5|$|Unlike Rogue Squadron, {{which was}} {{developed}} and released for the Nintendo 64 and Windows simultaneously, Battle for Naboo was ported to Windows and released two months later. The Windows version features enhanced resolution <b>and</b> <b>textures</b> and includes a mouse-supported menu interface. On October 24, 2001, it was re-released {{as a part of}} the LucasArts Archive Series.|$|E
5|$|A remastered {{version of}} Grim Fandango was {{announced}} during Sony's press conference at E3 2014, and {{was developed by}} Schafer's current studio Double Fine Productions with help from Sony to secure the property after Disney's acquisition and closure of the LucasArts studio. The remastered title, featuring improved character graphics <b>and</b> <b>textures,</b> an orchestrated score, and directors' commentary, was released on January 27, 2015 for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms. Android and iOS versions were released on May 5, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Image {{provided}} David Brothers {{to serve}} as the series' editor. Unlike traditional comic editors who focus on coordinating schedules and pushing deadlines, Brothers only reviews the work and provides responses that help the team create better work with more internal consistency. Eric Trautman, who had previously edited two of Rucka's novels, was recruited to help with research, timelines, and design work. Lark wanted to work with a European colorist to provide a look distinct from traditional American comics. Rucka suggested Santi Arcas, a colorist he had worked with in the past, and Lark particularly liked Arcas' skies <b>and</b> <b>textures.</b>|$|E

50|$|Maturity {{refers to}} the {{physiological}} age of the animal rather than the chronological age. Because the chronological age is virtually never known, physiological maturity is used; and the indicators are bone characteristics, ossification of cartilage, color <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> of ribeye muscle. Cartilage becomes bone, lean color darkens <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> becomes coarser with increasing age. Cartilage and bone maturity receives more emphasis because lean color <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> can be affected by other postmortem factors.|$|R
40|$|Polyacrylonitryle (PAN) fibers {{are used}} {{on a large scale}} in textile {{industry}} but, some sorts of PAN fibers are valuable precursors for specific carbon fiber (CF) due to their best fitness to the purpose e. g. for high strength CF or for active CF. The application of PAN as precursors of CF is based on its specific structure <b>and</b> <b>texture.</b> Thus, the properties of PAN base CF strongly depend on PAN structure, <b>texture</b> <b>and</b> fiber morphology. In this respect, the paper addresses the modeling of PAN fiber structure <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> <b>and,</b> subsequently, estimation of structure <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> parameters based mainly on Wide Angle X-ray Diffraction (WAXD) technique and other data. The PAN fiber structure <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> parameters were calculated on the basis of classical X-ray diffraction theory applied to paracrystals. The preferred orientation parameters were calculated on a wide accepted model...|$|R
5|$|Rendering was {{executed}} in Mental Ray, using numerous custom-made shaders to produce lifelike lighting, water and landscapes. Wireframes {{also served as}} a guide to model the backgrounds. In total Riven has over three hours of video and almost five thousand images; rendering was a major bottleneck in production despite the use of 18 dedicated workstations. Some scenes consisted {{of tens of thousands of}} individual models <b>and</b> <b>textures</b> and more than a hundred virtual light sources. Loading a single island model could take two hours. Runtime animation effects were created by Mark DeForest, to add flying insects and simple water ripples.|$|E
5|$|Square Enix {{chose to}} update Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2s {{graphics}} for a remastered release in high-definition. With a production cycle longer than two years, the graphics were not merely upscaled to higher resolutions and feature updated models <b>and</b> <b>textures.</b> Kitase commented {{that he wanted}} to excite new and returning players and added more depth to do so and opened up the possibility of further remasters based on reception. Many views could not simply be reframed to 16:9 because that would reveal characters waiting for their cues off-screen, so the remastering team performed a lot of redrawing and additions to the visuals.|$|E
5|$|The ninth nocturne, {{dedicated}} to Cortot's wife, Clotilde Bréal, {{is the first}} of three that share a directness and sparseness in contrast with the more elaborate structures <b>and</b> <b>textures</b> of their predecessors. The left-hand accompaniment to the melodic line is simple and generally unvaried, and the harmony looks forward to later composers of the 20th century, using a whole tone scale. Most of the piece is inward-looking and pensive, presaging the style of Fauré's final works, although it ends optimistically in a major key.|$|E

Contentbased image retrieval systems have traditionally used color <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> analyses. These analyses {{have not always}} achieved adequate level of performance and user satisfaction. The growing need for robust image retrieval systems {{has led to a}} need for additional retrieval methodologies. CIRES addresses this issue by using image structure in addition to color <b>and</b> <b>texture.</b> The efficacy of using structure in combination with color <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> is demonstrated...|$|R

5|$|A {{variety of}} marine animals possess active {{camouflage}} through {{their ability to}} change colour rapidly. Several bottom-living fish such as the flounder can hide themselves effectively against a variety of backgrounds. Many cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid similarly use colour change, in their case both for camouflage and signalling. For example, the big blue octopus, Octopus cyanea, hunts during the day, and can match itself to the colours <b>and</b> <b>textures</b> of its surroundings, both to avoid predators and to enable it to approach prey. It can perfectly resemble a rock or a coral it is hiding beside. When necessary, in order to scare away a potential predator, it can display markings which resemble eyes.|$|E
5|$|As with Gearbox's {{previous}} expansion pack , Blue Shift {{returns to}} the setting and events of the original game, but portrays the story {{through the eyes of}} another person. The protagonist in Blue Shift is a security guard, Barney Calhoun, employed by the Black Mesa Research Facility. After a scientific mishap causes Black Mesa to be invaded by aliens, Calhoun must fight his way to safety. The game received mostly positive reception. Many reviewers were critical of the short length of the game and the lack of new content, although the inclusion of a High Definition pack that upgraded the models <b>and</b> <b>textures</b> in both Blue Shift and the preceding Half-Life games was praised.|$|E
5|$|BioWare {{provided}} its Aurora Engine from Neverwinter Nights for the sequel. One of {{the decisions}} to use Aurora rather than build a new engine from scratch was the toolset—Obsidian wanted players {{to continue to be}} able to make content for the game, which may not have been possible with a new engine. BioWare made itself available to Obsidian with technical support on the engine, but Obsidian planned on completely overhauling Aurora, including its code. The designers wanted to improve the visuals of the first game with additions such as better lighting <b>and</b> <b>textures,</b> which required significant changes to the engine. The upgraded engine was referred to as Electron. Electron was designed to incorporate DirectX to make it compatible for a potential Xbox 360 release, but Obsidian eventually abandoned plans for a port to the system for financial reasons. The toolset that was used to create the game was also revamped, and included several additions like a customizable interface, a new dialogue format, and building assistants—similar to the wizards found in Microsoft Word and Excel. Like Neverwinter Nights, the toolset was included in the game's release for players to use.|$|E

5|$|For the game's characters, the {{developers}} {{intended to keep}} the comical looks from the previous games, but they decided to update their appearances with realistic materials <b>and</b> <b>textures</b> {{to take advantage of}} the more powerful level of graphics capabilities of seventh-generation consoles. The designers first drew character sketches to determine the characters' looks and clothing, creating a main and an alternate outfit for each character, which were then made into reference artwork. Afterward, low-level meshes for each character were created, with details added with Zbrush, resulting in characters that, before being scaled down for the game environment, had more than six million polygons. Textures and pixel shaders were added using the team's previous work on Tony Hawk's Project 8 to match the style of earlier Guitar Hero games. Unlike the Tony Hawk games, each character in the game was given a unique skeleton to match their variations in sizes and shapes, allowing the animators to create unique moves for individual characters. Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock introduces three new characters modeled after real-life musicians. Slash, Tom Morello, and Bret Michaels, each performing one or more songs from their past recordings. All three were brought into the game using motion capture from the Motion Analysis Corporation.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the game's animations were original, with very few borrowed from Grand Theft Auto III. For the characters, the team used motion capture and stop motion animation techniques; cutscenes use the former, while gameplay movements {{use a combination of}} both techniques. The team encountered difficulty in animating motorcycle animations, {{due in part to the}} variety of models. Pedestrian character models use skins in Vice City, allowing the artists to produce more realistic characters. There are 110 unique pedestrian models throughout the game world alongside roughly 50 story characters; each character is rendered using twice the amount of polygons <b>and</b> <b>textures</b> found in Grand Theft Auto III. This also impacted the character physics, improving gameplay aspects such as weapon-hit accuracy. Some character models and scenarios were inspired by films such as The Godfather (1972), and the game's presentation was inspired by action television shows of the 1980s. The interplay between Tommy Vercetti and Lance Vance was crafted to be similar to the relationship of Miami Vices Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs.|$|E
5|$|The show's {{producers}} and creators presented material in a narrative format {{instead of the}} more traditional magazine format, used repetition to reinforce its curriculum, and structured every episode the same way. They used research about child development and young children's viewing habits that had been conducted in the thirty years since the debut of Sesame Street in the U.S. and revolutionized the genre by inviting their viewers' involvement. Research {{was part of the}} creative and decision-making process in the production of the show and was integrated into all aspects and stages of the creative process. Blue's Clues was the first cutout animation series for preschoolers and resembles a storybook in its use of primary colors and its simple construction paper shapes of familiar objects with varied colors <b>and</b> <b>textures.</b> Its home-based setting is familiar to American children but has a look, unlike other children's TV shows. A live production of Blue's Clues, which used many of the production innovations developed by the show's creators, toured the U.S. starting in 1999. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances.|$|E

Similarity between regions, and therefore between images, is computed through three feature vectors (F) encoding properties of color, shape <b>and</b> <b>texture,</b> represented by color moments, edge direction histogram <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> neighborhood, respectively. The distance between pairs of color feature vectors is computed by Euclidean distance, while distances between pairs of shape <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> feature vectors are computed by city-block distance.|$|R
