40|$|Objective: This study {{investigated}} whether treatment with the anti-tumor necrosis factor-a monoclonal antibody <b>afelimomab</b> would improve survival in septic patients with serum interleukin (IL) - 6 concentrations of > 1000 pg/mL. Design: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Setting: Eighty-four intensive care units in academic medical centers in Europe and Israel. Patients: A total of 944 septic patients were screened and stratified {{by the results}} of a rapid qualitative immunostrip test for serum IL- 6 concentrations. Patients with a positive test kit result indicating IL- 6 concentrations of > 1000 pg/mL were randomized to receive either <b>afelimomab</b> (n 5 224) or placebo (n 5 222). Patients with a negative IL- 6 test (n 5 498) were not randomized and were followed up for 28 days. Interventions: Treatment consisted of 15 -min infusions of 1 mg/kg <b>afelimomab</b> or matching placebo every 8 hrs for 3 days. Standard surgical and intensive care therapy was otherwise delivered. Measurements and Main Results: The study was terminated prematurely after an interim analysis estimated that the primary efficacy end points would not be met. The 28 -day mortality rate in the nonrandomized patients (39. 6 %, 197 of 498) was significantly lower (p <. 001) than that found in the randomized patients (55. 8 %, 249 of 446). The mortality rates in the IL- 6 test kit positive patients randomized to <b>afelimomab</b> and placebo were similar, 54. 0 % (121 of 224) vs. 57. 7 % (128 of 222), respectively. Treatment with <b>afelimomab</b> was not associated with any particular adverse events. Conclusions: The IL- 6 immunostrip test identified two distinct sepsis populations with significantly different mortality rates. A small (3. 7 %) absolute reduction in mortality rate was found in the afelimomab-treated patients. The treatment difference did not reach statistical significance. Peer reviewe...|$|E
