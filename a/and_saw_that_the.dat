5|$|Martin Luther King Jr. was the {{conscience}} of his generation. He gazed upon {{the great wall of}} segregation <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> power of love could bring it down. From the pain and exhaustion of his fight to fulfill the promises of our founding fathers for our humblest citizens, he wrung his eloquent statement of his dream for America. He made our nation stronger because he made it better. His dream sustains us yet.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, Blaine {{ran for a}} seat in the Maine House of Representatives, and was elected. He ran {{for reelection}} in 1859, 1860, and 1861, and was {{successful}} each time by large majorities. The added responsibilities led Blaine to reduce his duties with the Advertiser in 1860, and he soon ceased editorial work altogether. Meanwhile, his political power was growing as he became chairman of the Republican state committee in 1859, replacing Stevens. Blaine was not a delegate to the Republican convention in 1860, but attended anyway as an enthusiastic supporter of Abraham Lincoln. Returning to Maine, he was elected Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives in 1861 and reelected in 1862. With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, he supported Lincoln’s war effort <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Maine Legislature voted to organize and equip units to join the Union Army.|$|E
5|$|The local {{population}} remained faithful to Skanderbeg {{and did not}} reveal his whereabouts. Isak bey and Hamza grew confident that Skanderbeg had been defeated and had thus began to withdraw. When he judged the time right, Skanderbeg gave the signal for the army, which had up until then been in separate groups, to assemble without being seen by the Ottomans. The army gathered by the hills at Tumenishta – as the weakest point in the Ottoman camp was in this direction – and on 2 September 1457, it was split again into three groups to assault the Ottoman camp. With {{some of his most}} trusted men, he climbed to a high peak to scout on the Ottoman camp <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ottomans were resting. He descended with his chosen band to eliminate any watching guards, but one saw Skanderbeg and fled into the camp yelling that Skanderbeg had arrived. In order to maintain the surprise, Skanderbeg ordered his men to get ready for battle.|$|E

5|$|Seeing Arnaud felled by gunfire, Magruder, who {{was wearing}} body armor, stepped back and drew her sidearm. However, before she could return fire, Logan then shot six bullets at her, one of which struck her in the head, mortally {{wounding}} her. Logan then went over to Arnaud and, while standing over his body, shot him four more times, injuring his liver and inducing severe internal bleeding. Arnaud would die from severe gunshot-induced blood loss at the scene, but the mortally wounded Magruder was able to call for assistance over her radio at 9:34p.m. Logan's father, {{who was in the}} house's master bedroom, had heard the gunshots, and thinking that the deputies had shot him, went over to see what had happened. Instead, he saw Logan leaving the house with a firearm in hand, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two deputies had been shot. Logan's father then called 9-1-1 via telephone at 9:39p.m. to report the shooting to authorities. Emergency medical technicians arrived and removed Arnaud and Magruder were removed from the house via stretchers, with Magruder being airlifted via medical helicopter to the Prince George's Hospital Center, with CPR being applied on her while en route. However, she would be pronounced dead at the hospital before midnight.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{election}} to the Chatham town council, Bennett's days in the town were numbered. He was ambitious <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> small community was too narrow a field for him. He was already negotiating with Sir James Lougheed {{to move to the}} North-West Territories and become his law partner in Calgary. Lougheed was Calgary's richest man and most successful lawyer.|$|E
25|$|The {{next morning}} Freyja woke <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> doors to her bower were open, yet unbroken, {{and that her}} {{precious}} necklace was gone.

She told Odin of the malice he had allowed against her and of the theft of her necklace, {{and that he should}} give her back her jewelry.|$|E

25|$|Filming for Don 2 was {{expected}} to begin in April 2010, but was postponed until fall. Principal photography began on 10 October in Berlin; {{it was the first}} Bollywood film shot in that city. The decision to shoot in Berlin was made after Khan attended the Berlin International Film Festival for its screening of My Name is Khan <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> city provided the required realistic backdrop. Before shooting began the German government announced the film on its website, promising support and co-operation during filming. A 70-member Indian crew travelled to the city for two weeks of preparation for shooting. Scenes were filmed at the Brandenburg Gate, the Alexanderplatz, the French Cathedral and the East Side Gallery.|$|E
25|$|When Operations Officer of Combat Command B Maj. Ben Cothran arrived <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{bridge was}} still standing, he radioed Brig. General William M. Hoge, {{commanding}} officer of the Combat Command B, 9th Armored Division. Hoge joined them {{as quickly as he}} could. Engemen was cautiously considering his options when Hoge ordered him to immediately move into town and to capture the bridge as quickly as possible. Timmermann had been promoted only the night before to commander of Company A, and Engemen ordered him to take Co. A/14th Cavalry and a company of dismounted infantry into Remagen. Hoge had no intelligence on the number and size of German forces on the east bank. The standing bridge could have been a trap. Hoge risked losing men if the Germans allowed U.S. forces to cross before destroying it and isolating the American troops on the east bank. But the opportunity was too great to pass up.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of May 31, in a {{farmhouse}} on a hill just above the South Fork Dam, Elias Unger, president of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, awoke {{to the sight of}} Lake Conemaugh swollen after a night-long heavy rainfall. Unger ran outside in the still-pouring rain to assess the situation <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> water was nearly cresting the dam. He quickly assembled a group of men to save the face of the dam by trying to unclog the spillway; it was blocked by the broken fish trap and debris caused by the swollen waterline. Other men tried digging a ditch {{at the other end of}} the dam, on the western abutment which was lower than the dam crest. The idea was to let more water out of the lake to try to prevent overtopping of the crest, but without success. Most remained on top of the dam, some plowing earth to raise it, while others tried to pile mud and rock on the face to save the eroding wall.|$|E

25|$|Limousine driver Allan Park {{testified that}} he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, {{he did not see}} Simpson's white Bronco parked at the curb. Park {{testified that he}} had been looking for and had seen the house number, and the {{prosecution}} presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time). According to Simpson's version of events, the Bronco had been parked in that position for several hours. Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on the telephone to his friend, Rachel Ferrara. Park parked opposite the Ashford street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham street gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limousine and looked through the Ashford gate <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> house was dark with no lights on, except for a dim light coming from one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While smoking a cigarette, Park made a series of phone calls from his cellular to the pager of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still on the phone to Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside wall of his guest house. Kaelin {{hung up the phone and}} ventured outside to investigate the noises but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked to the front of the property where he saw Park's limousine outside the Ashford gate.|$|E

500|$|In an {{affidavit}} {{three days after}} the shooting, Abu Rahma said shots had been fired for about 45minutes and that he had filmed around 27minutes of it.

He began filming Jamal and Muhammad when he heard Muhammad cry <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> boy {{had been shot in the}} right leg. He said he filmed the scene containing the father and son for about six minutes. He sent those six minutes to Enderlin in Jerusalem via satellite.

500|$|Walker came on deck in his {{dressing}} gown, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{ship was}} being driven toward the western lee shore by the east wind. [...] When the French navigator came on deck, {{he explained to}} Walker where he was; Walker immediately ordered the anchor cables cut, and beat against the wind to escape the danger. [...] Two of the warships, Montague and Windsor, had more difficulty, and ended up anchored for {{the night in a}} precarious situation, surrounded by breakers. [...] Throughout the night, Walker heard sounds of distress, and at times when the fog lifted, ships could be seen in the distance being ground against the rocks. [...] One New Englander wrote that he could [...] "hear the shrieks of the sinking, drowning, departing souls." [...] Around 2:00 am the wind subsided, and then shifted to the northwest, and most of the fleet managed to stand away from the shore.|$|E

2500|$|Tomoyuki Mori of What's In? called [...] "Sayonara wa Emotion" [...] "heart-shaking", and {{described}} the song as [...] "an impressive blend of next-level folk, electronica, guitar rock".

Mori believed that the song comfortably unified rhythm and sound, while CDJournal reviewers believed that the song's minimal and electronic sound created [...] "a world of Sakanaction", where that the song's comfortable nature gave listeners a floating feeling.|$|E
