5|$|These {{ships were}} based on the {{preceding}} B class, but were enlarged to increase their endurance and to allow for the inclusion of a QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft gun. This class introduced a director control tower for British destroyers. The 'C' class were unique in having a split bridge, with the compass platform and wheelhouse separated from the chartroom and director tower. This unusual layout was not repeated. As per Admiralty policy in alternating Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear and <b>ASDIC</b> (sonar) capability between destroyer flotillas, the C class lacked <b>ASDIC</b> and were designed to carry only six depth charges. The D class were repeats of the C's, except that the TSDS was replaced by storage for up to 30 depth charges and <b>ASDIC.</b>|$|E
5|$|Havelock was {{completed}} without a director-control tower (DCT) so the three remaining 4.7-inch low-angle guns fired in local control using ranges {{provided by a}} rangefinder. She was fitted with an <b>ASDIC</b> set to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water.|$|E
5|$|Like most corvettes, Fredericton was {{installed}} with a Type 123A <b>ASDIC</b> detection system. This technology was designed in 1934 for armed trawlers and minesweepers of the Royal Navy. The system was outdated but {{was the best}} system available to the Canadian Navy at the time. Type 123A could detect the distance to underwater sounds but could not determine the depth.|$|E
5|$|Until late 1939, A/S {{work had}} largely been ignored. In the opening {{months of the}} trade defence war, September 1939 to early 1940, three main points arose in this respect. Firstly, the Germans were {{incapable}} of maintaining a sustained anti-shipping campaign owing to {{a small number of}} U-boats. Second, the Air Staff's fear of massed air attacks on shipping did not take place and could be discarded. Thirdly, despite the first two points, losses to Allied shipping from U-boat attack was enough for importance of A/S to increase. The Royal Navy's belief in an <b>ASDIC</b> equipped surface fleet to effectively sweep the seas clear of U-boats proved unfounded (owing to the limitations of <b>ASDIC</b> and vulnerability of surface vessels). Coastal Command aircraft had proven best able to locate U-boats, but the flawed anti-submarine bombs (ASBs) meant that they could not inflict severe damage to enemy submarines.|$|E
5|$|When {{purchased}} by Canada in 1937–38, the four C-class destroyers were refitted to meet Canadian specifications, including {{the installation of}} Type 124 <b>ASDIC.</b> It {{is not clear how}} much Kempenfelt had been modified when she was turned over in October 1939, other than steam heating had yet been fitted.|$|E
5|$|In April 1937 she {{returned}} to Portsmouth with Glorious, and on 20 May the ship participated in the Coronation Review of the fleet at Spithead by King George VI. Four days later, Comet began a refit at Portsmouth that lasted until 18 June. The ship resumed plane guard duties for Glorious in the Mediterranean. She began a major refit at Chatham on 26 May 1938 to bring her up to Canadian specifications that included the installation of Type 124 <b>ASDIC.</b>|$|E
5|$|The E {{class were}} ordered {{as part of}} the 1931 Naval Construction Programme, the F class {{following}} in 1932. These ships were based on the preceding D class with minor changes to the hull and armament. Two of the ships were modified to accommodate 60 mines. The F class were repeats of the E's with some minor differences. All of the destroyers were fitted with <b>ASDIC</b> (sonar) and the ability to use the Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear.|$|E
5|$|The G {{class were}} ordered {{as part of}} the 1933 Naval Construction Programme, the H class {{following}} in 1934. These ships were based on the preceding F class, but the elimination of cruising turbines and the development of more compact machinery allowed their dimensions and displacement to be slightly reduced. The H class were repeats of the G's with some minor differences. All of the destroyers were fitted with <b>ASDIC</b> (sonar) and the ability to use the Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1916, Canadian {{physicist}} Robert William Boyle {{and other}} scientists of the Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee (<b>ASDIC)</b> undertook research which ultimately {{led to the development}} of sonar technology. Acoustic sounding equipment was developed which could be operated much more rapidly than the sounding lines, thus enabling the German Meteor expedition aboard the German research vessel Meteor (1925–27) to take frequent soundings on east-west Atlantic transects. Maps produced from these techniques show the major Atlantic basins, but the depth precision of these early instruments was not sufficient to reveal the flat featureless abyssal plains.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942 the U-boats {{became aware}} of Coastal Command {{aircraft}} using another innovation – sonobuoys, which were {{thought of as the}} air equivalent of the Navy's <b>ASDIC.</b> A U-boat reported them on 29 July being dropped in the north transit area, and they were thought by the enemy to be devices for preventing U-boats from travelling on the surface. They were, in fact, for detecting submerged U-boats, and were used by No. 210 Squadron RAF, operating Sunderlands. In operational records they were coded High Tea. Most crews were unaware of their existence. The devices stayed in use until 1998, when some wartime crews saw them for the first time. Until then the RAF had kept them secret.|$|E
5|$|In May and June, at {{the very}} western end of the English Channel, U-boats began {{operating}} effectively. Some 17 attacks were made by aircraft on the U-boats, none successful. The ASB was ordered to be replaced with the DC. No specialised aerial DCs were available. A modified 450lb Naval DC was used. No effective tactics were available to locate U-boats. By 1940, they attacked at night, and on the surface. <b>ASDIC</b> was useless against surfaced submarines, and flares {{could not be used}} at the low altitude required by aircraft to make an attack. To combat this, closer co-operation by the Navy and Coastal Command was needed.|$|E
5|$|In September 1939, as {{with most}} other aspects of A/S, no clear plan existed for the {{armament}} of Coastal Command's aircraft. While operational control {{was given to the}} Admiralty, the faith of both services in <b>ASDIC</b> proved ill-founded. It ruled out the submarine threat, and caused a refocusing on surface attacks. In addition, no A/S weapons had been developed properly in the inter-war period. Most of the munitions were left over from the First World War, due in part to a wish to economise and the fact no order had been given to dispose of them.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with her}} sister , Crescent was sold to Canada on 20 October 1936 for a total price of £400,000. She was {{refitted}} again to meet Canadian standards, including the installation of <b>ASDIC</b> (sonar), and taken over by them on 1 February 1937. The ship was renamed as HMCS Fraser and commissioned into the RCN at Chatham on 17 February. Fraser {{was assigned to the}} Canadian Pacific Coast and arrived at Esquimalt on 3 May 1937. She remained there until she was ordered to the East Coast on 31 August 1939.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Wrangler {{became the}} first ship of her class to be {{converted}} into a Type 15 anti-submarine frigate. This was a major reconstruction that involved {{the removal of the}} superstructure, masts and armament as well most of the internal equipment. To increase the usable volume of the hull and to improve crew comfort, the forecastle deck was extended almost {{all the way to the}} stern and a new superstructure was built above it, made of aluminium to reduce topweight. Two lattice masts were added to carry the Type 277Q surface-search, Type 274 navigation, and Type 293Q gunnery radars. The ship's main gun armament now consisted of a twin-gun turret fitted with 4-inch (102mm) Mk XVI guns mounted aft and a water-cooled, twin-gun Mk V mount for 40mm Bofors guns above the bridge. The pair of triple-barrelled Squid anti-submarine mortars were shifted to the quarterdeck aft and were controlled by Type 170 and 174 <b>ASDIC</b> systems.|$|E
5|$|The French Navy {{decided to}} {{reinforce}} her anti-aircraft armament {{in light of}} its wartime experience. Her no. 3 gun turret was to be moved to the No. 4 position, its magazine converted for extra fuel storage, and a new twin 37mm Mle 1933 mount would replace {{it on top of}} the rear deck house. Two more Mle 1933 mounts were to fitted {{on each side of the}} rear deckhouse and a fourth mount was to replace the 13.2Hotchkiss machine guns forward of the bridge. One 13.2mm Browning machine gun was to planned to be mounted on each side of the forward twin 37mm guns. This plan was later amended to add a degaussing cable, replacement of the SS-6 sonar by a French copy of the British <b>ASDIC</b> and six of the new mitrailleuse de 25 mm contre-aéroplanes Modèle 1940 anti-aircraft guns, plus two more 13.2mm Brownings mounted on the forward corners of the center deck house.|$|E
5|$|De la Ferté {{was highly}} {{critical}} of the Air Ministry's attitude to his service. In 1937 several exercises were carried out by Coastal Command in co-operation with submarines against the Home Fleet to judge the surface fleet's defence against submarine and air attack. However, despite the experiences of the First World War, no attention was paid to the problem of attacking submarines from the air as part of trade protection measures. Owing to misplaced faith in the imperfect <b>ASDIC</b> invention which was never intended to detect surface-running submarines, it appeared the Royal Navy no longer considered U-boats a threat to Britain's sea lanes. The Air Ministry, keen to concentrate on strategic air forces, did not dispute the Admiralty's conclusions and Coastal Command did not receive any guidance from the Air Ministry. The saving grace for both services was the construction of the Combined Headquarters which enabled rapid collaboration in maritime operations. This {{was one of the few}} successes in organisation and preparation made before the outbreak of war.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1941 the mitrailleuse de 25 mm contre-aéroplanes Modèle 1940, a naval {{adaptation}} of an Army anti-aircraft gun, became available. So Volta was modified between August and November 1941 with two single 25mm guns where the Hotchkiss machine guns had been mounted. Their platform was widened and one additional Browning machine gun was added {{on each side of}} the platform. The Hotchkiss guns were moved to the upper deck on either side of the after deck house. A degaussing cable was added during this same refit. Later in the year the SS 6 sonar was scheduled to be replaced by a French copy of the British <b>ASDIC,</b> but it was still sitting on the dockside when Volta was scuttled in Toulon Harbour when the Germans tried to seize the fleet on 27 November 1942 to prevent it from defecting to the Allies. She was raised on 20 May 1943 by the Italians, but no effort was made to repair her. Volta was bombed and sunk on 24 November 1943 and later refloated and scrapped in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with her}} sister , Cygnet was sold to Canada on 20 October 1936 for a total price of £400,000. She was {{refitted}} again to meet Canadian standards, including the installation of Type 124 <b>ASDIC,</b> and handed over on 1 February 1937. The ship was renamed as HMCS St. Laurent and commissioned into the RCN on 17 February. St. Laurent was assigned to Halifax, Nova Scotia and arrived there in May. She remained there for a year before she was transferred to Esquimalt in 1938. The ship remained there until she was ordered to the East Coast on 31 August 1939, arriving at Halifax on 18 September. St. Laurent escorted local convoys while based there, including the convoy carrying half of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division to the UK on 10 December. The ship was ordered to Plymouth on 24 May 1940 and arrived there on 31 May. Upon arrival, the ship's rear torpedo tube mount was removed and replaced by a 12-pounder AA gun and the 2-pounders were exchanged for quadruple Mark I mounts for the QF 0.5-inch Vickers Mark III machine gun.|$|E
25|$|Hedgehog {{fitted to}} enable remote attacks while keeping <b>ASDIC</b> contact.|$|E
25|$|At 0406 Vidette made an <b>ASDIC</b> {{contact at}} , {{and made a}} {{hedgehog}} attack causing two explosions. Historians suggest this attack destroyed U-630.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, British <b>ASDIC</b> {{technology}} was transferred for free to the United States. Research on <b>ASDIC</b> and underwater sound was expanded in the UK and in the US. Many new types of military sound detection were developed. These included sonobuoys, first developed by the British in 1944 under the codename High Tea, dipping/dunking sonar and mine detection sonar. This work {{formed the basis for}} post-war developments related to countering the nuclear submarine.|$|E
25|$|A major {{difference}} between the RN vessels and the RCN, USN, and other navies' vessels was the provision of upgraded <b>ASDIC</b> and radar. The RN was a world leader in developing these technologies, and thus RN Flowers were somewhat better-equipped for remote detection of enemy submarines. A {{good example of this}} is the difficulty that RCN Flowers had in intercepting U-boats with their Canadian-designed SW1C metric radar, while the RN vessels were equipped with the technologically advanced Type 271 centimetric sets. In addition, RCN vessels were incapable of operating gyrocompasses, making <b>ASDIC</b> attacks more difficult.|$|E
25|$|The Bathursts were {{equipped}} with modified Type 128 <b>asdic</b> equipment, redesigned {{to be used}} without a gyroscopic stabiliser. Minesweeping equipment also varied across the class: ships {{equipped with}} the newer 'LL' minesweeping gear were distributed as evenly as possible throughout major Australian ports.|$|E
25|$|Several other {{pioneering}} innovations included acoustic- and electro-absorbent coatings to {{make them}} less of an <b>ASDIC</b> or RADAR target. The Germans also developed active countermeasures such as facilities to release artificial chemical bubble-making decoys, known as Bold, after the mythical kobold.|$|E
25|$|The {{gyro compass}} was {{introduced}} in 1908. The first passive sonar hydrophones were introduced into the RN in 1914 while <b>ASDIC</b> (active sonar) came in afterwards. Radar {{was introduced in}} the 1930s. Wireless (radio) technology greatly improved during the period and direction finding sets were used.|$|E
25|$|She was {{in reserve}} at the Nore in 1919, but was {{modified}} to conduct radio and <b>Asdic</b> trials. She recommissioned in March 1920 for {{the trials and}} became a cadet training ship in 1922. Antrim was sold for scrap on 19 December 1922 and was subsequently broken up at Blyth, Northumberland.|$|E
25|$|Underwater {{detection}} capability {{was provided by}} a fixed <b>ASDIC</b> dome; this was later modified to be retractable. Subsequent inventions such as the High Frequency Radio Detection Finder (Huff-Duff) were later added, along with various radar systems (such as the Type 271), which proved particularly effective in low-visibility conditions in the North Atlantic.|$|E
25|$|For {{the seven}} months {{following}} her arrival in Fremantle, she engaged in routine patrols off the Australian coast before being refitted at Sydney in October 1942. Here, she received British <b>ASDIC,</b> degaussing equipment, Y-gun, and Oerlikon 20 mm anti-aircraft autocannons. Thus outfitted, she served once {{again as a}} convoy escort, occasionally towing targets as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{ships were}} {{equipped}} with Type 145 and Type 147B <b>ASDIC.</b> The Type 147B {{was tied to}} the Squid anti-submarine mortar and would automatically set the depth on the fuses of the projectiles until the moment of firing. A single Squid-launched attack had a success rate of 25%. The class was also provided with HF/DF and Type 277 radar.|$|E
25|$|River-class frigates {{were the}} first Royal Canadian Navy {{warships}} to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter {{in addition to the}} irregular <b>ASDIC.</b> This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{weaknesses}} of the Draug-class ships was their lack of effective anti-aircraft armament, Draug herself being equipped with a single 12.7mm Colt anti-aircraft machine gun. She also carried a Madsen machine gun that was rendered inoperable {{by the absence of}} a vital part. Draugs anti-submarine weapons were equally primitive, with four depth charges located on the stern. The depth charges had no throwing mechanism and had to be dropped overboard manually. The ship also had no radar or <b>asdic</b> to help in locating targets.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{mobilisation}} in mid-1914 her squadron {{was assigned}} to the Grand Fleet and spent much of its time patrolling the northern exits from the North Sea. Antrim was sent to Arkhangelsk in mid-1916 and then to the North America and West Indies Station for convoy escort duties. She was paid off at the end of 1917, but was recommissioned in mid-1918 as a convoy escort. The ship was in reserve by 1919, but conducted radio and <b>Asdic</b> trials in 1920 before becoming a training ship in 1922. Antrim was sold for scrap {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E
25|$|This {{may have}} been {{ameliorated}} by the winter of 1939, at which point a number of articles about the Norden appeared in the US popular press with reasonably accurate descriptions of its basic workings. But when these were {{traced back to the}} press corps at the Army Air Corps, the Navy was apoplectic. Instead of accepting it was now in the public domain, any discussion about the Norden was immediately shut down. This drove both the Air Ministry and Royal Navy to increasingly anti-American attitudes when they considered sharing their own developments, notably newer <b>ASDIC</b> systems. By 1940 the situation on scientific exchange was entirely deadlocked as a result.|$|E
25|$|The regiment's {{positions}} were frequently shelled during the winter. Until {{the end of}} March 1945 there were almost daily engagements of single enemy aircraft in the area. During the operations in the Klever Reichswald (Operation Veritable), 126 LAA continued to defend the critical Waal and Maas crossings in support of II Canadian Corps. Improved radar techniques were allowing effective LAA barrages to be fired, driving the attackers back to higher levels into the range of HAA guns. In April the regiment {{formed the basis of}} 'Kenforce' under its CO, Lt-Col W.D. Kenyon, which included a troop of 2 S/L Rgt, a troop of 93 LAA, two companies of Belgian Fusiliers and Royal Navy detachments operating <b>ASDIC</b> to detect underwater attacks on the bridges.|$|E
25|$|In {{the latter}} half of 1942, she was {{attached}} to Submarine Forces, Southwest Pacific, and operated independently out of Brisbane as a target for the submarines out of Fremantle. She then gave submariners practice in making approaches and battle surfacing. With the beginning of the Buna-Gona offensives in New Guinea, Tulsa escorted PT boats to take part in that campaign and operated between Milne Bay, New Guinea, and Cairns, Australia. When the PT boat base at Kana Kopa, on the southeastern shores of Milne Bay, was established in November 1942, Tulsa brought in much-needed equipment to aid in the operations being-conducted from that base. But five days before Christmas 1942, Tulsa grounded on an uncharted pinnacle and damaged her <b>ASDIC</b> gear, necessitating a return to yard facilities for repairs.|$|E
25|$|After commissioning, Deloraine {{sailed to}} Darwin, {{where she was}} based {{for the first part}} of her career as a convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol vessel. On 20 January 1942, the United States {{destroyer}} USS Edsall, escorting the American oiler USS Trinity (AO-13), reported a Japanese submarine was in the area after an unsuccessful attack on the oiler. The submarine, I-124 of the Imperial Japanese Navy, tried and failed to torpedo Deloraine at 1:35 pm, with Deloraine locating the submarine on <b>asdic.</b> After two depth-charge attacks the submarine briefly broke the surface. Deloraine then observed 'large bubbles of oil and air'. Sister ships Katoomba and Lithgow arrived in the area; the two ships continuing to patrol and depth-charge the area while Deloraine reloaded. They were successful, and the four ships were jointly credited with the kill of I-124—the first enemy submarine to be sunk in Australian waters, going down with 80 lives.|$|E
