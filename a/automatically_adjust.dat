5|$|For team matches, bots {{are used}} to fill {{the roles of the}} player's teammates. The player can choose the bots' skill level or have it <b>automatically</b> <b>adjust</b> to the player's performance. Bots can be further {{customized}} by changing attributes such as names, appearance, and weapon preferences. In team matches, players can give orders to bots on their team. The PC version supports multiplayer mode over the internet or a local area network (the original Unreal was mainly a single-player game).|$|E
5|$|Milius {{recruited}} his friend, Basil Poledouris, {{to produce}} the score for Conan; they had had a successful collaboration on Big Wednesday. The film industry's usual practice was to contract a composer to start work after the main scenes had been filmed, but Milius hired Poledouris before principal photography had started. The composer was {{given the opportunity to}} compose the film's music based on the initial storyboards and to modify it throughout filming before recording the score near the end of production. Poledouris made extensive use of Musync, a music and tempo editing hardware and software system invented by Robert Randles (subsequently nominated for an Oscar for Scientific Achievement), to modify the tempo of his compositions and synchronize them with the action in the film. The system helped make his job easier and faster; it could <b>automatically</b> <b>adjust</b> tempos when the user changed the positioning of beats. In the montage where Conan grows up, for example, Poledouris had Randles prepare, over the phone, a long accelerando that landed on precise moments in the picture along the way. Poledouris would otherwise have had to conduct the orchestra and adjust his compositions on the fly. Conan is the first film to list Musync in its credits.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to their}} very wide input voltage range, many power {{supplies}} with active PFC can <b>automatically</b> <b>adjust</b> {{to operate on}} AC power from about 100V (Japan) to 230V (Europe). That feature is particularly welcome in power supplies for laptops.|$|E
25|$|The needle gun has {{advantages}} over other scaling tools. Its main {{advantage is that}} the needles <b>automatically</b> <b>adjust</b> themselves to contours, making the tool {{a good choice for}} cleaning irregular surfaces. A needle gun can clean an area to bare metal in seconds, and compares well to other scaling tools in terms of accuracy and precision.|$|E

Inventions in Great Britain {{in the late eighteenth}} and nineteenth centuries led to sails that <b>automatically</b> <b>adjust</b> to the wind speed without the need for the miller to intervene, {{culminating}} in patent sails invented by William Cubitt in 1807. In these sails, the cloth is replaced by a mechanism of connected shutters.|$|E
25|$|Digital instruments, which {{necessarily}} incorporate amplifiers, use {{the same}} principles as analog instruments for resistance readings. For resistance measurements, usually a small constant current is passed through the device under test and the digital multimeter reads the resultant voltage drop; this eliminates the scale compression found in analog meters, but requires a source of precise current. An autoranging digital multimeter can <b>automatically</b> <b>adjust</b> the scaling network so the measurement circuits use the full precision of the A/D converter.|$|E
25|$|The use of bourdon tube, diaphragm, {{and digital}} depth gauges may require {{adjustment}} for use at altitude. Capillary gauges {{have been shown}} to be a conservative method for measurement of compensated depth at altitude. Modern dive computers detect changes in altitude or accept it as a user input and <b>automatically</b> <b>adjust</b> their calculation of a safe decompression regime for a dive at that altitude. If an altitude-aware computer is not used, altitude decompression tables must be used.|$|E

25|$|Automated blinds are {{installed}} on specific windows that modeling predicted would receive the most sun. These “smart blinds” <b>automatically</b> <b>adjust</b> {{depending on the}} sunlight levels and orientation. On the roof, sensors with hemi-spherical lens acts as photocells, monitoring the intensity of lights. A wind sensor causes the blinds to retract into their housings when the wind exceeds 40mph. Interior controllers on the ceiling are programmed based on the blinds’ orientation towards the sun, building latitude and an astronomical clock that tracks the seasons.|$|E
25|$|Playing & editing {{software}} often contains tag editing functionality, {{but there are}} also tag editor applications dedicated to the purpose. Aside from metadata pertaining to the audio content, tags may also be used for DRM. ReplayGain is a standard for measuring and storing the loudness of an MP3 file (audio normalization) in its metadata tag, enabling a ReplayGain-compliant player to <b>automatically</b> <b>adjust</b> the overall playback volume for each file. MP3Gain may be used to reversibly modify files based on ReplayGain measurements so that adjusted playback can be achieved on players without ReplayGain capability.|$|E
25|$|Customization was {{significantly}} overhauled, specifically by allowing equipment {{and other items}} to modify their appearance based on who it is equipped to. Depending upon which party member has received it, a piece of armour would <b>automatically</b> <b>adjust</b> its shape and aesthetics in order to fit that particular character while still maintaining their identity. Players can craft and customize armour or weapons using the materials they have collected; rarer materials give the particular weapon or armour piece better attributes. Players can customize their keeps, such as rebuilding a garden as a Chantry church or a herb garden. These upgrades have minor effects on the Inquisitions espionage, commerce or military capabilities.|$|E

25|$|Carbon fiber {{is used on}} the roof, hood, fenders, front {{splitter}}, and rocker moldings; {{the hood}} and fenders are painted over, while the roof and splitter are merely covered in a clear-coat, retaining their black color. A polycarbonate window {{is placed in the}} center of the hood, allowing the engine intercooler to be seen from the exterior. The wheels are the largest ever placed on a production Corvette, with both front and rear wheels increasing in size and diameter over the Corvette Z06. Carbon-ceramic brakes are included. The brake calipers are painted blue, as are the engine intercooler trim and the ZR1 logo. Magnetic Selective Ride Control is also included on the car, with sensors to <b>automatically</b> <b>adjust</b> stiffness levels based on road conditions and vehicle movement.|$|E
25|$|Internationalized ECE Regulation 48, {{in force}} {{in most of}} the world outside North America, {{currently}} specifies a limited range within which the vertical aim of the headlamps must be maintained under various vehicle load conditions; if the vehicle isn't equipped with an adaptive suspension sufficient to keep the headlamps aimed correctly regardless of load, a headlamp leveling system is required. The regulation stipulates a more stringent version of this anti-glare measure if the vehicle has headlamps with low beam light source(s) that produce more than 2,000 lumens – xenon bulbs and certain high-power halogens, for example. Such vehicles must be equipped with headlamp self-leveling systems that sense the vehicle's degree of squat due to cargo load and road inclination, and <b>automatically</b> <b>adjust</b> the headlamps' vertical aim to keep the beam correctly oriented without any action required by the driver.|$|E
25|$|The Adaptive Cruise Control {{function}} senses {{the speed}} and pace of vehicles ahead, and can <b>automatically</b> <b>adjust</b> the speed the car is traveling at accordingly to maintain one of four user selectable gaps. Pre-Collision Braking uses the same cameras to monitor {{the activity of the}} vehicles ahead, and alerts the driver visually and audibly. If the driver fails to act, more alerts will be sounded and the car will actively brake itself. According to the IIHS, the Legacy prevented a collision while traveling at 25mph towards a stopped obstacle. When the car was first released for the 2015 model year, Lane Departure with Sway warning was included in the Eyesight package. This function watched the driver's position within the lane lines, and alerted the driver if they were drifting out of the lane (if a turn signal was used, this alert was not activated), with Sway warning notified the driver if they appeared to be unable to stay centered in the lane, suggesting they may be overly drowsy. For the 2016 model year, a Lane Keep Assist was added, which applied steering torque to prevent the driver from drifting from the lane. This function is active above 40 miles an hour. Also standard on all cars with the Eyesight system are adaptive fog lights aid in turns and cornering and is based on the steering wheel degree.|$|E

25|$|Scientists {{who study}} {{perception}} and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations. Depth perception consists of processing {{over half a}} dozen visual cues, {{each of which is}} based on a regularity of the physical world. Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects. Sound waves go around corners and interact with obstacles, creating a complex pattern that includes useful information about the sources of and distances to objects. Larger animals naturally make lower-pitched sounds as a consequence of their size. The range over which an animal hears, on the other hand, is determined by adaptation. Homing pigeons, for example, can hear very low-pitched sound (infrasound) that carries great distances, even though most smaller animals detect higher-pitched sounds. Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that are thought to have been significant for fitness in the EEA. For example, salt and sugar were apparently both valuable to the human or pre-human inhabitants of the EEA, so present day humans have an intrinsic hunger for salty and sweet tastes. The sense of touch is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and pain. Pain, while unpleasant, is adaptive. An important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation. For example, one's eyes <b>automatically</b> <b>adjust</b> to dim or bright ambient light. Sensory abilities of different organisms often coevolve, {{as is the case with}} the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make.|$|E
500|$|As {{defined in}} the {{proposed}} legislation, the tax rate is 23% for the first year. [...] This percentage {{is based on the}} total amount paid including the tax ($23 out of every $100 spent in total). This would be equivalent to a 30% traditional U.S. sales tax ($23 on top of every $77 spent—$100 total). The rate would <b>automatically</b> <b>adjust</b> annually based on federal receipts in the previous fiscal year. With the rebate taken into consideration, the FairTax would be progressive on consumption, but would also be regressive on income at higher income levels (as consumption falls as a percentage of income). [...] Opponents argue this would accordingly decrease the tax burden on high-income earners and increase it on the middle class. Supporters contend that the plan would effectively tax wealth, increase purchasing power and decrease tax burdens by broadening the tax base.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the most}} notable aspects of Aria is its {{incorporation}} of technology in the exterior and interior design of the hotel, specifically for the reduction of energy consumption. It is the largest hotel {{in the world to}} have earned LEED Gold certification. On account of its smart rooms which <b>automatically</b> <b>adjust</b> curtains, turn off unused lights and electronics, and regulate the temperature when a guest enters or leaves a room, Aria was described in Popular Mechanics as possibly [...] "the most technologically advanced hotel ever built".|$|E
