The experiment showed that G. anceps in particular can prey on all instars of both mosquito species and maintain a steady predation rate over time. The <b>ability</b> <b>for</b> these flatworms to live in artificial containers showed the potential of placing these species in popular mosquito breeding sites, which would ideally {{reduce the amount of}} mosquito-borne diseases.|$|E

Social psychological research suggests that co-operative goals and applying <b>abilities</b> <b>for</b> mutual benefit can strengthen the leader relationship between Japanese managers and their Chinese employees. Working in Japanese enterprises in Shanghai, China, 100 employees in private Japanese companies in China indicated their goal interdependence with their Japanese and Chinese managers, their applying <b>abilities</b> <b>for</b> mutual benefit and their conclusions that their manager had valuable abilities and was an effective leader. Structural equation analysis suggested that applying <b>abilities</b> <b>for</b> mutual benefit mediates the relationship between goal interdependence and leader resourcefulness and effectiveness, especially when the manager is Chinese and less so when their manager is Japanese. These results, coupled with previous research, were interpreted as suggesting that co-operative goals and applying <b>abilities</b> <b>for</b> mutual benefit contribute to effective leadership even when managers and employees have different nationalities...|$|R
