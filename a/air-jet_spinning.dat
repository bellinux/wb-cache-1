5000|$|The {{processes}} to make yarn short-staple yarn (typically spun from fibers from 0.75 to 2.0") are blending, opening, carding, pin-drafting, roving, spinning, and—if desired—plying and dyeing. In long staple spinning, the process may start with stretch-break of tow, a continuous [...] "rope" [...] of synthetic fiber. In open-end and <b>air-jet</b> <b>spinning,</b> the roving operation is eliminated. The spinning frame winds yarn around a bobbin. [...] Generally, after this step the yarn is wound to a cone for knitting or weaving.|$|E

In this report period we are reporting {{the analysis of the}} twist distribution in the spinning zone of an <b>air-jet</b> <b>spinning</b> system, and the effect of the use of an MIY device in Jet Spinning. TWIST DISTRIBUTION IN SPINNING ZONE OF <b>AIR-JET</b> <b>SPINNING</b> In t roduct ion <b>Air-jet</b> <b>spinning</b> method is akin to false-twisting of a yarn. The main bundle of fibers is under the false-twisting action of an air vortex. It is, therefore, important to know the twist distribution in the main bundle along the traveling direction of the yarn in the spinning zone. It was earlier thought that the twist in the core bundle along the yarn threadline prior to the twister remains constant as assumed by Krause et a 1 [l]. However, Grosberg et a 1 [2) have published their experimental evidence claiming {{that this is not the}} case. Lunenschloss and Bergmann [3] have reported the photographic evidence that the false-twist of the core decays gradually after the second twisting jet, as cited by Schwabe et a 1 [4]. The experimental evidence reported in the literature indicates that core twist must vary along the threadline in <b>air-jet</b> <b>spinning.</b> However, the published results are not in general agreement with each other, and there appears to be a need to re-analyze {{the previous}} work. The notation of symbols in the following analysis are as follows: I: Moment of inertial per unit length of yarn; K: Yarn torsional rigidity; k: A positive constant; 1 : Distance between the front-roller nip and delivery-roller nip...|$|E
40|$|From {{the present}} {{research}} work it is concluded that properties of ring spun yarn are better than <b>air-jet</b> <b>spun</b> yarn. Under different blend ratios, yarn and fabric tensile properties improved gradually as the share of polyester in the blend was increased. However under two different yarn spinning systems (ring and air-jet), fabric strength, of ring spun yarn knitted fabrics is greater as compared to <b>air-jet</b> <b>spun</b> yarn. The results indicated that yarn and fabric strength as well as fabric weight showed highly significant effects of machine and blending ratio...|$|R

Hook types and their extent, spinning in-coefficient and mean fibre extent in the yarns produced on different spinning technologies are investigated. The {{results show that the}} hook extents for open-end friction spun yarn are the highest followed by rotor, ring and <b>air-jet</b> <b>spun</b> yarns. Ring and <b>air-jet</b> <b>spun</b> yarns have higher percentage and extent of trailing hook as compared with leading hook, whereas, rotor and friction spun yarns show the reverse trend...|$|R

Other systems include <b>air-jet</b> and open-end <b>spinning,</b> a technique where the staple fiber is blown by air into a rotor and attaches to the tail of formed yarn that is continually being drawn out of the chamber. Other methods of break spinning use needles and electrostatic forces.|$|R

The nozzle-twisting device is designed to create the 3 -D rotating airflow to twist nanofiber bundles. The airflow characteristics inside the twisting chamber are studied numerically.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method is}} developed for modeling {{the dynamics of}} a flexible fiber immersed in a compressible swirling flow. The modeling approachis based on combining an Eulerian finite volume formulation for the fluidflow and a Lagrangian small-deformation formulation for {{the dynamics of the}} fiber. The fiber is modeled as a chain of beads connected through mass-less rods. The bending and twisting deformation of the fiber are represented by the displacements of the successive beads. A computational strategy is proposed for the computation of the fluid parameters at the center of discrete fiber sections. To deal with the fiber-wall interaction, a wall model is also developed. The new algorithm was verified against the experimental observations using high-speed photography. The proposed model has also been applied in a textile process to simulate the fiber motions in the two nozzles (i. e., cylindrical and diverged conical tubes, respectively) of an <b>air-jet</b> <b>spinning</b> machine, and consequently, the principle ofthe air-jet yarn formation can be demonstrated.

40|$|A {{numerical}} model for particle-level simulation of fiber suspensions {{has been used}} to simulate fiber dynamics in three-dimensional tangentially injected swirling airflow in <b>air-jet</b> <b>spinning</b> nozzles. The fiber is modeled as chains of beads connected through massless rods, and its flexibility is defined by the bending and twisting displacements. The effects of some parameters, such as fiber initial position, the injection angle and the injector diameter on fiber motion and yarn properties are discussed. The springy, snake-like and week helical regimes of fiber motion are observed under the most cases. The far from the tube center the fiber release position, the smaller the fiber flexibility is. For a smaller injection angle, the self-entanglement regimes of fiber motion are observed in the downstream of the injectors. The model also predicted the complex helical configuration in the nozzle with a small injector diameter. The predictions of yarn properties coincide with the experimental results reported by several researchers. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E

40|$|Although ring {{spinning}} is the universal spinning system but main {{limitation of this}} system is its limited spindle speed which causes lower production rate. Now-a-days spinners are trying to finding out various alternative spinning systems among which only rotor and air-jet has established market value. So {{it is very important}} for spinners to find out a suitable one according to end use and others economic aspects. Ring, Rotor and <b>Air-jet</b> <b>spinning</b> systems provide yarn with different structures and properties. Each system has its advantages and limitations in terms of technical feasibility and economic viability. We have produced 20 's Ne, 100 % cotton yarn from the above systems and their properties are tested by UT 5 and lea strength tester. The main object of the project is to study the yarn properties (Um%, CVm%, Imperfection, Hairiness etc) of ring, rotor and air-jet spun yarn and compare among them.

40|$|Abstract: Taguchi Method is {{explained}} in brief {{and one of}} the textile processes, called spinning process, is optimised by using Taguchi method for manufacturing optimum packing density of different technologies yarns. The effect of process variables like: lap hank, card draft, draft/doublings and drafts at speed frame, ring frame, rotor and <b>air-jet</b> <b>spinning</b> ma-chine on packing density parameters of respective technology yarn was analysed. The effect of noise variables was also accounted for. The trends of change in packing density with process variables are opposite to those of yarn diameter and helix angle of ring, rotor and air-jet yarns studied. The packing density is found to be the highest in air-jet yarn and the lowest in rotor yarn. Increase in draft in air-jet spinner and decrease in rotor spinner increase packing density of the re-spective yarns. The change in noise variables does affect the packing density parameters of yarns. Result analysis using Taguchi Method was according to the perception of some of the previous researcher on the subject. Hence, Taguchi method can be also used to optimise a textile process, where the product quality is highly variable and dependent on the combination of number of processes as well as on machine parameters...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{properties}} of air-jet yarns compared to rotor spinning Mohamed Eldessouki 1, 2, Sayed Ibrahim 3 and Ramsis Farag 2, 4 In yarn production, {{the mechanism of}} twist insertion {{is a major factor}} that affects the structure and ultimately the properties and characteristics of the produced yarn. Moreover, the differences within the same spinning technique may have a similar effect where, for instance, the {{properties of}} yarns produced using Murata Vortex Spinning (MVS) and Reiter <b>air-jet</b> <b>spinning</b> (J 20) will differ, although both technologies are just varieties of the same twist insertion principle of using a stream of air. In this work, the structure and properties of Murata vortex, Reiter, and rotor-spun yarns are compared with more emphasis on their mechanical behavior under dynamic stresses. Unlike the dynamic mechanical analysis of materials that presumes linear viscoelastic behavior and is only valid under small strains, this work suggests a cyclic loading with larger strains as a means of the dynamic evaluation of the yarns. Results show {{no significant difference between the}} technologies in terms of their initial modulus and maximum elongation, while a significant difference between the technologies is observed in the maximum loading and, to some extent, the work of rupture. The dynamic sonic modulus is compared to the results of the standard mechanical and the suggested cyclic loading tests, and a high correlation between the values was observed...|$|E
