5|$|Continuing to emphasise good {{relations}} with the white settlers, in August 1963 Kenyatta met with 300 white farmers at Nakuru. He reassured them that they would be safe and welcome in an independent Kenya, and more broadly talked of forgiving <b>and</b> <b>forgetting</b> the conflicts of the past. Despite his attempts at wooing white support, he did not do the same with the Indian minority. Like many indigenous Africans in Kenya, Kenyatta bore a sense of resentment towards this community, despite the role that many Indians had played in securing the country's independence. He also encouraged the remaining Mau Mau fighters to leave the forests and settle in society. However, throughout Kenyatta's rule, many of these individuals would remain unemployed, with unemployment being one of the most persistent problems facing his government.|$|E

25|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} theatrically in North America on March 20, 2009, to mostly positive reviews.

Michelle was known for being the housemate to get the most such fines - $65,000. Geneva had the least amount of fines $15,000, two in the early days at the house and one near the end of her eviction.|$|E

Following a trip to Hollywood, Kirsty and Lionel fell out and separated. They reconciled only for a truck to ram into the hospital, giving Kirsty severe amnesia <b>and</b> <b>forgetting</b> ever loving Lionel. She moved back onto badboy Greg. Kirsty realized Greg was still a junkie and returned to Lionel, with 1996 ending on the two's kiss.|$|E

Whenever policy changes were announced, if {{he played a}} role in lobbying for those changes, he would keep quiet about his involvement. Xun Liang (荀良), one of his younger relatives, advised him to let others know the good deeds he did so that he would gain greater respect. Wu Tong (武統), his son-in-law, also urged him to attract people to support him. However, Xun Xu refused to listen to them and he warned his sons against forming their own political clouts <b>and</b> <b>forgetting</b> their place as subjects of the emperor. Later, Emperor Wu promoted Xun Xu to be the Prefect of the Masters of Writing (尚書令).|$|E
25|$|Hermann Ebbinghaus {{contributed a}} lot to the {{research}} of the memory of the brain. He made the first empirical study concerning the function of the memory as to the storage <b>and</b> <b>forgetting</b> of information. His major finding was that the amount of learned knowledge depends on the amount of time invested. Further, the more time that is passing by, the more repetitions that are necessary. Resulting from the findings of Ebbinghaus, the first theory of forgetting was established, the decay theory. It says that if something new is learned, a memory trace is formed. This trace will decay, if not used in the course of time, and by decaying of this trace, forgetting occurs (Weltens 1987).|$|E
25|$|The {{novel was}} {{received}} well by young Austrians in the 1980s. To them, the book represented {{a story of}} truth that was long hidden. At a time when Austria was starting to take on responsibility for its nonaction during World War II, February Shadows threw light on problems of the past. Reichart displayed to her own nation that ignoring <b>and</b> <b>forgetting</b> {{events such as the}} Mühlviertler Hasenjagd was unacceptable and not to be tolerated. Some older Austrians, who had lived through the war, considered February Shadows controversial and inappropriate. Much like the character Hilde, they felt the past should stay in the past, that there was a reason for Austrian silence about the events of World War II: to protect lives.|$|E

25|$|Resnais's {{first feature}} film was Hiroshima mon amour (1959). It {{originated}} as a commission from {{the producers of}} Nuit et Brouillard (Anatole Dauman and Argos Films) to make a documentary about the atomic bomb, but Resnais initially declined, thinking {{that it would be}} too similar to the earlier film about the concentration camps and that it presented the same problem of how to film incomprehensible suffering. However, in discussion with the novelist Marguerite Duras a fusion of fiction and documentary was developed which acknowledged the impossibility of speaking about Hiroshima; one could only speak about the impossibility of speaking about Hiroshima. In the film, the themes of memory <b>and</b> <b>forgetting</b> are explored via new narrative techniques which balance images with narrated text and ignore conventional notions of plot and story development. The film was shown at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival, alongside Truffaut's Les Quatre Cents Coups (The 400 Blows), and its success became associated with the emerging movement of the French New Wave.|$|E
25|$|The {{programme}} was {{a success}} and a full series followed, continuing, with breaks, until 1974, when the Christmas special became the final episode. Although the popularity of Steptoe and Son made Corbett a star, it ended his serious acting as he became irreversibly associated with Harold Steptoe in the public eye. Before the series began, Corbett had played Shakespeare's Richard II to great acclaim; however, when he played Hamlet in 1970, he felt both critics and audiences alike were not taking him seriously and could only see him as Harold Steptoe. Corbett found himself receiving offers only for bawdy comedies or loose parodies of his alter-ego Harold. Production of the sitcom was {{in the last few}} years stressful as Brambell was an alcoholic, often ill-prepared for rehearsals <b>and</b> <b>forgetting</b> his lines and movements. A tour of a Steptoe and Son stage show in Australia in 1977 proved a disaster due to Brambell's drinking. During the tour, the pair appeared in character in an advert for Ajax soap powder.|$|E
25|$|In the {{simplest}} terms, collective memory {{can be understood}} as the memory of a group of people, and is usually associated with the passing of that memory from generation to generation. However, there are many nuances to this idea; it must also be considered in terms of the processes of remembering <b>and</b> <b>forgetting</b> events. Thus, when a typical emotional event is socially shared and propagates to perhaps 50 other people, that event becomes a collective memory for that group or community of people. When the emotional event is particularly intense, the event would be expected to undergo an even larger diffusion. Furthermore, the more intense the emotional event is, the more rapid the diffusion should be and should reach more people in a shorter amount of time. This is especially true for events that are shared via mass media, such as newspapers, magazines, television, internet, etc. In this case, the collective memory is no longer confined to a local population, but instead can become that of a regional, national, or even international population. Besides the propagation of a single person’s emotional event, many people can simultaneously experience a single national emotional event, such as the disappearing of an important person. Such an event also becomes part of a collectively shared memory. However, {{it must be noted that}} each person still has their own personal memory of the event, such as where they were when they experienced the event, what they were doing, etc.|$|E

500|$|In April 1916 {{he wrote}} scathingly [...] in The New York Times about militant [...] Irish nationalism: [...] "In point of {{learning}} nothing <b>and</b> <b>forgetting</b> nothing these fellow-patriots of mine leave the Bourbons nowhere." [...] Total independence, he asserted, was impractical; alliance with a bigger power (preferably England) was essential. [...] The Dublin Easter Rising later that month {{took him by}} surprise. After its suppression by British forces, he expressed horror at the summary execution of the rebel leaders, but continued to believe {{in some form of}} Anglo-Irish union. In How to Settle the Irish Question (1917), he envisaged a federal arrangement, with national and imperial parliaments. Holroyd records that by this time the separatist party Sinn Féin was in the ascendency, and Shaw's and other moderate schemes were forgotten.|$|E

500|$|Altered {{dopamine}} neurotransmission is {{implicated in}} {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD), a condition associated with impaired cognitive control, in turn leading to problems with regulating attention (attentional control), inhibiting behaviors (inhibitory control), <b>and</b> <b>forgetting</b> things or missing details (working memory), among other problems. [...] There are genetic links between dopamine receptors, the dopamine transporter, and ADHD, in addition to links to other neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. The most important relationship between dopamine and ADHD involves the drugs that are used to treat ADHD. Some of the most effective therapeutic agents for ADHD are psychostimulants such as methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta) and amphetamine (Adderall, Dexedrine), drugs that increase both dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the brain. The clinical effects of these psychostimulants in treating ADHD are mediated through the indirect activation of dopamine and norepinephrine receptors, specifically dopamine receptor D1 and adrenoceptor A2, in the prefrontal cortex.|$|E
500|$|When the {{agitated}} Lakshamana—reaching {{the inner}} chambers of Sugriva and his harem—reproaches Sugriva for being ungrateful to Rama <b>and</b> <b>forgetting</b> his promise, the critical edition of Ramayana states that Tara voluntarily intervenes {{to calm the}} wrath of Lakshmana. In some Ramayana adaptations and North-western Indian manuscripts of Ramayana, it is Tara, not Ruma in whom Sugriva is engrossed when Lakshmana arrives. The South Indian manuscripts portray the drunk Sugriva, who is engrossed in lustful revel as being ignorant of Lakshmana's anger and sending Tara to pacify him, in some versions, {{even though she is}} drunk. Though intoxicated with [...] "half-closed eyes and unsteady gait", Tara manages to disarm Lakshmana. The intoxication of Tara is also described in original Ramayana, but in a different context. Tara is described as having made it a habit to visit Sugriva always in a tipsy state, before indulging in the [...] "new pleasures of love".|$|E
500|$|As {{the wave}} of {{mutilation}} breaks over Europe, the force animating the monsters proves fatal: any contact with their bodies or blood provokes a frenzy of organic growth, so that {{animals of different species}} grow into each other and humans are strangled by their own growing organs.

Using the energy of the remaining tourmaline veils, they construct massive towers—the eponymous [...] "Giants"—out of humans, animals, and plants, grotesque assemblages of organic life that, planted on mountains or in the sea, serve as defensive turrets. In a frenzied technological mania, some of the scientists turn themselves into giant monsters and wander around Europe, wreaking havoc <b>and</b> <b>forgetting</b> their original intent. A group of the original Iceland expedition led by Kylin returns to Europe, bearing the memory of the devastation they caused.|$|E
