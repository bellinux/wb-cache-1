5|$|The {{southern}} boobook {{is found}} across Australia, although is scarce in more arid regions such as western New South Wales, southwestern and western Queensland, much of South Australia {{away from the}} coast and interior Western Australia and Northern Territory. In drier areas it is generally found along watercourses such as the Darling and Paroo Rivers, and Lake Eyre basin. It is found on numerous offshore islands such as Groote Eylandt, Melville Island, Mornington Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria and many islands off eastern Australia. It is found in southern New Guinea, Roti, Timor and surrounding islands in Indonesia. It is found {{in a wide range}} of habitats, from forest and open woodland to scrubland and semi-desert areas. In Australia it resides in mainly Eucalypt forests. It has adapted to landscapes altered by human activity and is found in farmland and suburban areas <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some scattered trees. In fact, it can adapt to any habitat <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some trees present.|$|E

In 2012, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, announced the Gallions Reach Crossing, a replacement ferry service running further east from Beckton to Thamesmead expected to open in 2017.

5|$|Apart from {{originating}} {{theories on}} the entrepreneur and spatial economics, Cantillon {{also provided a}} dedicated theory on population growth. Unlike William Petty, who believed there always existed {{a considerable amount of}} unused land and economic opportunity to support economic growth, Cantillon theorised that population grows only <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> economic opportunities present. Specifically, Cantillon cited three determining variables for population size: natural resources, technology, and culture. Therefore, populations grow only as far as the three aforementioned variables allowed. Furthermore, Cantillon's population theory was more modern than that of Malthus in the sense that Cantillon recognised a much broader category of factors which affect population growth, including the tendency for population growth to fall to zero as a society becomes more industrialised.|$|E

5|$|Ti Noel {{has been}} {{won in a}} card game by a {{plantation}} owner based in Santiago, and Lenormand de Mezy dies in abject poverty shortly afterwards. Ti Noel saves {{enough money to buy}} his passage, and as a free man, he discovers a free Haiti. Now much older, he realizes that he has returned to the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy. Haiti has undergone great development, and the land has come {{under the control of the}} black man. Ti Noel is abruptly thrown into prison and once again made to work as a slave among children, pregnant girls, women, and old men. Henri Christophe, formerly a cook and now king due to the black uprising, is using slaves to construct lavish statues, figures, and a magnificent fortress. Ti Noel considers slavery under a fellow black man worse than that endured at the hands of Lenormand de Mezy. In times past, the loss of a slave would be a financial loss, but <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> black women to continue supplying slaves, their deaths are insignificant. Ti Noel escapes and returns to the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy, where he remains for some time, and later returns to the city to find it gripped by fear of Henri Christophe's regime. King Christophe is tormented by thunder strikes and ghosts of formerly tortured subjects, and eventually he and Sans-Souci Palace are overrun by the blacks and by voodoo. Left alone, he commits suicide and his body is taken by the remaining African pages to the magnificent fortress where they bury him in a pile of mortar. The entire mountain becomes the mausoleum of the first King of Haiti.|$|E

25|$|LC-MS {{is widely}} used {{in the field of}} {{bioanalysis}} and is specially involved in pharmacokinetic studies of pharmaceuticals. Pharmacokinetic studies are needed to determine how quickly a drug will be cleared from the body organs and the hepatic blood flow. MS analyzers are useful in these studies because of their shorter analysis time, and higher sensitivity and specificity compared to UV detectors commonly attached to HPLC systems. One major advantage is the use of tandem MS-MS, where the detector may be programmed to select certain ions to fragment. The measured quantity is the sum of molecule fragments chosen by the operator. <b>As</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no interferences or ion suppression, the LC separation can be quite quick.|$|E
25|$|One of Yad Vashem's tasks is {{to honor}} non-Jews who risked their lives, liberty. or {{positions}} to save Jews during the Holocaust. To this end, a special independent Commission, {{headed by a}} retired Supreme Court Justice, was established. The commission members, including historians, public figures, lawyers, and Holocaust survivors, examine and evaluate each case according to a well-defined set of criteria and regulations. The Righteous receive a certificate of honor and a medal, and their names are commemorated in the Garden of the Righteous Among the Nations, on the Mount of Remembrance, Yad Vashem. This is an ongoing project that will continue for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> valid requests, substantiated by testimonies or documentation. 555 individuals were recognized during 2011, and , more than 24,300 individuals have been recognized as Righteous Among the Nations.|$|E
25|$|The FAT {{file system}} {{itself does not}} impose any limits on the depth of a {{subdirectory}} tree for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> free clusters available to allocate the subdirectories, however, the internal Current Directory Structure (CDS) under MS-DOS/PCDOS limits the absolute path of a directory to 66 characters (including the drive letter, but excluding the NUL byte delimiter), thereby limiting the maximum supported depth of subdirectories to 32, whatever occurs earlier. Concurrent DOS, MultiuserDOS and DRDOS3.31 to 6.0 (up to including the 1992-11 updates) do not store absolute paths to working directories internally and therefore do not show this limitation. The same applies to Atari GEMDOS, but the Atari Desktop does not support more than 8 sub-directory levels. Most applications aware of this extension support paths up to at least 127bytes. FlexOS, 4680OS and 4690OS support a length of up to 127bytes as well, allowing depths down to 60 levels. PalmDOS, DRDOS6.0 (since BDOS7.1) and higher, NovellDOS, and OpenDOS sport a MS-DOS-compatible CDS and therefore have the same length limits as MS-DOS/PCDOS.|$|E

This position for tPA {{is based upon the}} findings of two studies by one group of investigators which showed that tPA improves the chances for a good neurological outcome. When administered within the first three hours thrombolysis improves functional outcome without affecting mortality. 6.4% of people with large strokes developed substantial brain bleeding as a complication from being given tPA thus {{part of the reason for}} increased short term mortality. Additionally, the American Academy of Emergency Medicine states that objective evidence regarding the efficacy, safety, and applicability of tPA for acute ischemic stroke is insufficient to warrant its classification as standard of care. Intra-arterial fibrinolysis, where a catheter is passed up an artery into the brain and the medication is injected at the site of thrombosis, has been found to improve outcomes in people with acute ischemic stroke.|$|E
