2500|$|The Great Moravian sacral {{architecture}} {{is represented by}} a rich variety of types from three-nave basilicas (Mikulčice III, Bratislava), triconcha (Devín), simple rotunda without apses (Mikulčice VII), two-apses rotunda (Mikulčice VI), tetraconchic rotunda (Mikulčice IX) and {{a whole group of}} one-nave churches and rotundas with one apse. The largest number of churches has been found in south-eastern Moravia. Mikulčice with 12 churches clearly dominates among all other localities with the first stone churches built around 800 [...] (a potential 13th church is the church [...] Kopčany on Slovak side of the border, but belonging to the Mikulčice agglomeration). The three-nave basilica from Mikulčice with the inside dimensions 35m by 9m and a separate baptistery is also the largest sacral building found. A high concentration of churches in Mikululčice exceeded real needs of the local population and they are interpreted <b>as</b> <b>proprietary</b> churches (Eigenkirchen) known also from the Frankish environment. Large churches were also important ecclesiastical centres of the country. The current dating of several churches precedes the Byzantine mission. The churches were decorated mostly by paintings created by the fresco technique, but usage of secco is also documented. The authors were probably foreign artists from Frankish and North-Italian environment (North-Italian origin is indicated e.g. by chemical composition of paintings in Bratislava and Devín).|$|E

2500|$|On 13 June 2013, the U.S. Army {{formally}} cancelled the Individual Carbine competition. [...] The Army said {{none of the}} carbines evaluated during testing met {{the minimum}} scoring requirement needed to continue to {{the next phase of}} the evaluation. [...] Letters were sent to gunmakers involved to inform them that no future contract awards would be made for the soldier evaluation phase. [...] PEO Soldier reported that no competitor demonstrated a significant improvement in weapon reliability to justify buying a new carbine. [...] Weapons tested also had low reliability performance using M855A1 Enhanced Performance Rounds (EPR). [...] Ultimately, the Army decided not to pursue a new carbine because of consideration of operational requirements in the context of available small arms technology, the constrained fiscal environment, and the capability of their current carbines. One reliability requirement that was not reached by the vendors was firing 3,592 mean rounds without malfunctioning. [...] In 1990, the M4 was required to fire 600 mean rounds between stoppages, while the current M4A1 fires 1,691 mean rounds between stoppages using M855A1 ammunition. [...] PEO Soldier said that the new carbine had to be a superior improvement, not a small improvement. [...] The Army has not released how close the competitors came to reaching the mean rounds between stoppages requirement, or how they performed compared to the M4A1. [...] That information is seen <b>as</b> <b>proprietary,</b> and may be up to the manufacturers to release data. [...] Analysis has not yet been done to determine if any exact event cause per vendor led to performance failures.|$|E
2500|$|Second, {{among those}} who believe in [...] "substantive" [...] fusion, there has been {{intensive}} discussion about the appropriate taxonomy that underlies the law of trusts. A first aspect of this is that, for some, trusts appear to straddle the supposed boundary between [...] "property" [...] and [...] "obligations". When English law was being codified and exported through the British Empire, for example in the Indian Trusts Act 1882, the authors thought it was thought appropriate to describe a trust as [...] "an obligation annexed to the ownership of property", implying a view often restated, that [...] "equity acts in personam". On the other hand, it has been consistently held that the beneficiary of a trust holds a proprietary right. This enables the beneficiary to claim priority over some (but not all) non-proprietary creditors in insolvency, or the beneficiary to bring a direct action in tort against a defendant who has damaged trust property. It is also acknowledged that the beneficiary may trace money that has wrongly been dissipated from the trust, but unlike a legal property owner, perhaps not against a bona fide purchaser. Peter Birks, on this ground, has suggested that beneficial interests trusts are a slightly weaker form of proprietary right. Ben McFarlane and Robert Stevens have alternatively suggested that beneficial interests are neither personal nor proprietary, but instead a [...] "right against a right". One of the difficulties underpinning the debate is that it assumes the distinction between obligations (which operate only between persons) and property (which either operate against a thing, or bind third parties) is a coherent one: [...] "proprietary" [...] rights do not ultimately operate against [...] "things" [...] rather than people, while supposedly [...] "personal" [...] obligations bind third parties who would interfere with them as much <b>as</b> <b>proprietary</b> rights are thought to. It would follow that a [...] "right against a right" [...] is conceptually incomplete, because a right is an abstract thing that cannot bear a duty: a person does. On this view the function of trusts is to form part of a system of priorities among all rights (regardless of their historical status as personal or property right) when faced of conflicts over assets, particularly against other creditors of an insolvent debtor.|$|E
