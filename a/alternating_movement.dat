40|$|Background/Aims: Motor {{impairment}} is {{an important}} aspect of cognitive decline in older adults. It has been suggested that complex motor control is affected earlier than gross motor control. The aims were to investigate if complex hand motor function was more affected than gross motor function in cognitively impaired older subjects, and to present reference values. Methods: <b>Alternating</b> forearm <b>movements</b> and grip strength were studied in 301 cases, 419 intermediates and 1, 207 controls, aged 60 - 93 years, controlling for demographic, health-related and functional factors and comorbidity. Global cognitive function was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination, and episodic memory by 3 -word delayed recall. Grip strength was assessed by the Grippit(R). The frequency of <b>alternating</b> <b>movements</b> during 10 s was registered electronically. Results: <b>Alternating</b> <b>movements</b> but not grip strength was associated with cognitive impairment (right: p = 0. 006; left: p = 0. 022). The mean <b>alternating</b> <b>movements</b> for the 70 -year-old male cases compared to the controls were 2. 3 versus 2. 5 Hz for the right, and 2. 2 versus 2. 4 Hz for the left arm (p < 0. 05), and for the 60 -year-old women 2. 0 versus 2. 3 Hz for the right arm (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: Complex but not gross hand motor function is associated with early cognitive impairment...|$|R

50|$|Aside from legless lizards, most lizards are quadrupedal {{and move}} using gaits with <b>alternating</b> <b>movement</b> {{of the right}} and leg limbs with {{substantial}} body bending. This body bending prevents significant respiration during movement, limiting their endurance, in a mechanism called Carrier's constraint. Several species can run bipedally, and a few can prop themselves up on their hindlimbs and tail while stationary. Several small species {{such as those in}} the genus Draco can glide: some can attain a distance of 60 metres (200 feet), losing 10 metres (33 feet) in height.|$|E

This is surprising, since (a) the parallels between supplementary motor area (SMA) damage and PD are well documented and (b) the SMA seems to play a special role in bilateral motor control. Bilateral versus unilateral movements in PD were examined by using a task that compared <b>alternating</b> <b>movements</b> of fingers of the same hand with <b>alternating</b> <b>movements</b> of fingers of the opposite hands.

The objective in a standard game is to capture the opponent's duke, by first placing the duke into guard, a condition paralleling check in chess.|$|E
40|$|Neuromotor {{movement}} {{activity has}} complexity in various aspects especially in fine motor functions which include repetitive and sequential movement. This research measures {{the performance of}} neuromotor movement of children aged 5 to 6 years old. The subject included 25 children comprising 15 boys and 10 girls. The research was done using Zurich Neuromotor Assessment which consisted of measuring the repetitive movement to finger, hand and foot; measuring the <b>alternating</b> <b>movement</b> to hand and foot and measuring the sequential movement to finger. Overall, the children were scored the average mean of 2. The average score of movement show that the sequential movement {{is the most difficult}} and followed by the <b>alternating</b> <b>movement</b> and the repetitive movement which proved to be an easier movement. The result of independent t-test showed that {{there was a significant difference}} between the boys and girl (t= 2. 632, p= 0. 015) showed the repetitive movement for dominant hand. There was a relationship between age and repetitive movement for the dominant foot (r= 0. 455, p= 0. 02, p< 0. 05). Finding showed that this particular group of children is at a moderate level of performance in neuromotor movement.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{development}} of a torsional fatigue testing machine for metallic materials is presented. This machine is considered type I according to the Weibull classification because the fatigue failure is caused by a load of inertial origin. The machine operation is based on the <b>alternating</b> <b>movement</b> that the transmission of a washing machine produces. The inertial load is caused by a flywheel located {{at the top of the}} machine. Unlike many machines that generate fatigue-alternating stresses through relocation or the rotation of the specimen on loads that are consistent across time, the design of the machine clearly shows how inertial loads due to the acceleration of the mechanical elements generated loads of alternating character which eventually causes fatigue failures...|$|E
40|$|Premovement excitability {{changes of}} the human corticospinal tract have focused mainly on {{isometric}} contractions.

Studies using a decerebrate cat model have shown that excitability of the spinal motoneurone is modulated very differently prior to a rhythmic and <b>alternating</b> <b>movement</b> when compared to an isometric contraction. The current study was designed to assess corticospinal excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation and spinal motoneurone excitability using transmastoid electrical stimulation, prior to arm cycling and an intensity-matched isometric contraction. Using these techniques we sought to determine whether a difference in corticospinal excitability occurred prior to cycling and an intensity-matched isometric contraction, as well as determine whether the changes were spinal or supraspinal in nature...|$|E
