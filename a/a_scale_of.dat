The star formation variation in <b>a</b> time <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> 10 8 yr and the mechanism responsible for the variation are discussed. Key Words : star formation, spiral galaxies I. INTRODUCTION The outline of the star formation history of spiral galaxies in <b>a</b> time <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> Gyr is established (e. g., Sandage 1986). The star formation rate (SFR) has been deceased continuously in an exponential way, and the time <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> the decrease depends on the Hubble type of morphology. Many starburst and post-starburst galaxies exist in the Local Universe. It suggests that the SFR in a galaxy could vary greatly in <b>a</b> time <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> 10 8 yr, which is a quite different view of the history in <b>a</b> time <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> Gyr. We investigate the statistics of the present star formation activity of spiral galaxies using available databases and study the star formation history in <b>a</b> time <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> 10 8 yr.

The headwaters of West Branch Fishing Creek had a score of 191, tying West Creek for the highest-rated site in the upper Fishing Creek watershed. Most of West Branch Fishing Creek received a rating between 166 and 200, indicating optimal habitat quality. The lower reaches of the creek, however, received a rating of 113 to 165, indicating suboptimal habitat quality.|$|E

The rating averages 138 where the creek is in Benton and the lowest rating is 115. This rating occurred downstream of the Market Street bridge in Benton.|$|E
