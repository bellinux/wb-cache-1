25|$|Igor Gouzenko, a cipher {{clerk in}} Soviet embassy in Ottawa, {{defected}} in 1945 {{with a mass}} of documents, one of {{which led to the}} arrest of Alan Nunn May for spying. Philby recommended that Hollis rather than Archer should be sent to Canada to interview Gouzenko although he knew Archer would be better able to do the job. Agreeing this, MI5 sent Hollis <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Philby at SIS who was apprised of progress and who altered, delayed and omitted messages before passing them on to MI5. By these means, Philby stopped Archer from having any involvement in the case.|$|E
25|$|One {{problem that}} had not been solved was {{atmospheric}} reentry. It had been shown that an orbital vehicle easily had enough kinetic energy to vaporize itself, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> known that meteorites can make it down to the ground. The mystery was solved in the US in 1951 when H. Julian Allen and A. J. Eggers, Jr. of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) made the counterintuitive discovery that a blunt shape (high drag) permitted the most effective heat shield. With this type of shape, around 99% of the energy goes into the air rather than the vehicle, and this permitted safe recovery of orbital vehicles.|$|E

500|$|This {{episode was}} the second episode of the series {{directed}} by Bryan Gordon. Gordon had previously directed the first season episode [...] "The Alliance". [...] "The Injury" [...] was written by Mindy Kaling, who also acts for the show as customer service representative Kelly Kapoor. After the character development that had occurred in the previous episode, [...] "Booze Cruise", Greg Daniels decided {{to create a more}} inane episode that involved [...] "Michael's grilled foot." [...] Writer and actor B. J. Novak said the idea for [...] "Injury" [...] started out as an idea in the writing room that just [...] "spun out of control". The original plan was for Michael to have fallen asleep in the sun, while having sunblock all over him, except for his foot. According to BJ Novak, the episode was originally going to be called [...] "My Grilled Foot", but writer Mindy Kaling thought it was [...] "too weird for people to tune in and watch that". Novak has described [...] "The Injury" [...] as one of his favorite episodes, and said of it, [...] "I don't think any other TV show would have made an episode from that starting point, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one of the funniest and most relatable episodes as it went on that we've ever had." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the eyes}} of Alan Moorehead, [...] "There {{has never been in}} modern times a colonial {{campaign}} quite like the British expedition to Ethiopia in 1868. It proceeds from first to last with the decorum and heavy inevitability of a Victorian state banquet, complete with ponderous speeches at the end. <b>And</b> <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a fearsome undertaking; for hundreds of years the country had never been invaded, and the savage nature of the terrain alone was enough to promote failure." ...|$|E

The Times thought his Hamlet a [...] "notable success", but not everyone agreed: W. S. Gilbert said of it, [...] "I never saw anything so funny in my life, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{not in the least}} vulgar." [...] In 1889 Tree also produced Charles Haddon Chambers's play The Tyranny of Tears. His Haymarket seasons were broken by visits to the United States in January 1895 and November 1896, and occasional visits to the provinces.|$|E

2500|$|Blaise Pascal {{invented a}} {{mechanical}} calculator with a sophisticated carry mechanism in 1642. After {{three years of}} effort and 50 prototypes he introduced his calculator to the public. He built twenty of these machines in the following ten years. [...] This machine could add and subtract two numbers directly and multiply and divide by repetition. Since, unlike Schickard's machine, the Pascaline dials could only rotate in one direction zeroing it after each calculation required the operator to dial in all 9s and then (method of [...] ) propagate a carry right through the machine. [...] This suggests that the carry mechanism would have proved itself in practice many times over. This {{is a testament to}} the quality of the Pascaline because none of the 17th and 18th century criticisms of the machine mentioned a problem with the carry mechanism <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> fully tested on all the machines, by their resets, all the time.|$|E
2500|$|Peter May captained the English cricket team in Australia in 1958–59, {{playing as}} England in the 1958-59 Ashes {{series against the}} Australians and as the MCC in their other matches on the tour. It was widely {{regarded}} as one of the strongest teams to depart English shores, comparable with the great teams of Johnny Douglas in 1911-12 and Percy Chapman in 1928-29. It had no obvious weaknesses, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> beaten - and beaten badly. By the First Test the top batsmen had made runs, the Surrey trio of Loader, Laker and Lock had taken wickets, as had Lancashire's Brian Statham. South Australia, Victoria and an Australian XI had all been beaten - the last by the crushing margin of 345 runs - and all seemed rosy for Peter May's touring team. But in the Brisbane Test they lost by 8 wickets and the rest of the series failed to offer any hope of reversing their fortunes. The reasons for their failure were manifold; the captain was too defensive; injuries affected their best players; others were too young and inexperienced such as Arthur Milton, Raman Subba Row, Ted Dexter, Roy Swetman and John Mortimore, or at the end of their career; Godfrey Evans, Trevor Bailey, Jim Laker, Willie Watson and Frank Tyson. Their morale was further bruised when faced with bowlers of dubious legality and unsympathetic umpires. Peter May was criticised for bringing his fiancée Virginia Gilligan, the niece of Arthur Gilligan who was in Australia as a radio commentator, to Australia (an unprecedented move in 1950s cricket). The press blamed the poor performance on the team's heavy drinking, bad behaviour and lack of pride - a foretaste the treatment losing teams would receive in the 1980s. It was not a happy tour by any means and it would take 12 years to recover The Ashes. As E.W. Swanton noted ...|$|E
