25|$|The pro-government {{alliance}} recaptured Mutshatsha on April 25. The {{village was}} nearly deserted {{when it was}} captured, but observers assigned symbolic importance to its recapture. Mobutu {{held a press conference}} and parade in Mutshatsha, telling 47 international journalists that he would continue to battle Soviet influence in Africa. That day, the International Monetary Fund said it would loan Zaire $85 million—perhaps, it was speculated, to deter a group of private banks from canceling the already loan of planned $250 million. At the request of France and the United States, the World Bank announced an upcoming convention to solicit <b>additional</b> <b>loans</b> for Zaire.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the additional lending decision of a creditor to a sovereign debtor in default. The analysis incorporates {{the prevalence of}} partial default {{and the amount of}} inherited debt in default. We show that an increase in additional lending, L, could increase the probability of repayment of both the loan outstanding and L, thereby increasing the expected return of L for a given interest rate. Thus, additional lending could be provided at a lower contract interest rate, implying a downward sloping <b>additional</b> <b>loan</b> supply curve. Moreover, we show that over some regions of the <b>additional</b> <b>loan</b> supply schedule the contract interest rate could be below the risk-free rate. Debt; Lending...|$|R

2500|$|The Bey was now {{determined}} to make the rebel areas pay {{for the cost of}} the war.

[...] The Sahel towns of Sousse, Mahdia and Monastir had previously been assessed for 3.5m piastres in tax payments - now the Bey demanded 25m from them.

[...] The oil harvest for 1865 was sold in advance to these middlemen. Wealthy townspeople were tortured until they revealed their hidden riches.

40|$|As {{for recent}} Japanese bank behavior, there exist two inefficacies. One is credit crunch, that is, banks {{hesitate}} to lend money to new good projects. The other is excessive <b>additional</b> <b>loan</b> to bad-performing firms. These two perverse bank behaviors look like contradictive each other. In this paper, we explain these contradictive behaviors {{stem from the}} violation of the absolute priority rule (APR) among the stakeholders in Japan. Under the legal violation of priority rule, the borrowers with inefficient projects can finance from a new junior creditor, transferring the credit value of the senior creditor to the new junior one. In such a situation, {{it is the best}} behavior for the senior creditor, i. e. bank, which tries to protect the value of his senior credit, to finance the inefficient project by himself before the junior creditor might lend money. This behavior implies inefficient excessive <b>additional</b> <b>loan.</b> Furthermore, since banks expect not to avoid such ex-post inefficiency and the accompanied loss due to the violation of APR, they are unwilling to lend to the originally efficient project in ex-ante. This results in credit crunch. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{expected and}} unexpected losses {{of a bank}} loan, {{taking into account the}} bankfs strategic control of the expected return on the loan. Assuming that the bank supplies an <b>additional</b> <b>loan</b> to minimize the expected loss of the total loan, we provide analytical formulations for expected and unexpected losses with bivariate normal distribution functions. There are two cases in which an <b>additional</b> <b>loan</b> decreases the expected loss: i) the asset/liability ratio of the firm is low but its expected growth rate is high; ii) the asset/liability ratio of the firm is high and the lending interest rate is high. With a given expected growth rate and given interest rates, the two cases are identified by two thresholds for the current asset/liability ratio. The bank maintains the current loan amount when the asset/liability ratio is between the two thresholds. Given the bankfs strategy, the bank decreases the initial expected loss of the loan. On the other hand, the bank has a greater risk of the unexpected loss.
