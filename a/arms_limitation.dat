5|$|Following {{his visit}} to China, Nixon met with Soviet leaders, {{including}} Brezhnev in Moscow. These Strategic <b>Arms</b> <b>Limitation</b> Talks resulted in two landmark arms control treaties: SALT I, the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles. These aimed to limit the development of costly anti-ballistic missiles and nuclear missiles.|$|E
5|$|Ford {{continued}} the détente policy {{with both the}} Soviet Union and China, easing the tensions of the Cold War. Still in place from the Nixon Administration was the Strategic <b>Arms</b> <b>Limitation</b> Treaty (SALT). The thawing relationship brought about by Nixon's visit to China was reinforced by Ford's December 1975 visit to that communist country. In 1975, the Administration entered into the Helsinki Accords with the Soviet Union, creating {{the framework of the}} Helsinki Watch, an independent non-governmental organization created to monitor compliance that later evolved into Human Rights Watch.|$|E
5|$|Another {{meeting on}} the issue was called on 6 December 1966, {{attended}} by Johnson, McNamara, the deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance, Walt Rostow of the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Joint Chiefs. Rostow took {{the side of the}} JCS and it appeared that development would start. However, McNamara once again outlined the problems and stated that the simplest way to close the ABM gap was to simply build more ICBMs, rendering the Soviet system impotent and a great waste of money. He then proposed that the money sidelined by Congress for deployment be used for initial deployment studies while the US attempted to negotiate an <b>arms</b> <b>limitation</b> treaty. Johnson agreed with this compromise, and ordered Secretary of State Dean Rusk to open negotiations with the Soviets.|$|E

50|$|Moody {{decommissioned}} at San Diego on 2 June 1930 and was towed to Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California, arriving {{there on}} 8 June 1930. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 3 November 1930 {{in accordance with}} naval <b>arms</b> <b>limitations</b> imposed under the London Naval Treaty.|$|R
5|$|Before Gorbachev's {{visit to}} Washington, D.C., {{for the third}} summit in 1987, the Soviet leader {{announced}} his intention to pursue significant arms agreements. The timing of the announcement led Western diplomats to contend that Gorbachev was offering major concessions to the United States on the levels of conventional forces, nuclear weapons, and policy in Eastern Europe. He and Reagan signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty) at the White House, which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons. The two leaders laid the framework for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START I; Reagan insisted that {{the name of the}} treaty be changed from Strategic <b>Arms</b> <b>Limitation</b> Talks to Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.|$|E
5|$|In the Senate, Cooper {{helped lead}} the {{opposition}} to the development and deployment of anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs), putting him at odds with many in his party, including President Nixon. Cooper had long been an opponent of ABMs, which he believed could intensify a worldwide nuclear arms race. On August 6, 1969, a vote to suspend funding of the development of ABMs failed in the Senate by a vote of 50–51; Vice-President Spiro Agnew cast the tie-breaking vote. After this defeat, Cooper and Michigan Senator Philip Hart co-sponsored the Cooper–Hart Amendment that would have allowed funding for research and development of ABMs, but banned deployment of a U.S. ABM system. The measure failed by three votes but increased congressional scrutiny of the Defense Department budget, leading to a reduction in funding and hastening Strategic <b>Arms</b> <b>Limitation</b> Talks with the Soviets. Cooper served as an advisor to President Nixon during the events leading up to the talks.|$|E
5|$|The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty was {{a mutual}} naval <b>arms</b> <b>limitation</b> and {{disarmament}} treaty between the five major naval {{powers of the}} time: the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Japan, Italy, and France. One of the main aspects of the treaty was the limitation on the number and size of capital ships each nation possessed; as the RAN was counted {{as part of the}} Royal Navy {{for the purposes of the}} treaty, Australia was one of the battlecruisers nominated for disposal to meet the British limit. The battlecruiser had to be made unusable for warlike activities within six months of the treaty's ratification, then disposed of by scuttling, as Australia did not have the facilities to break her up for scrap, and the British share of target ships was taken up by Royal Navy vessels. This was the only time the Australian military has been affected by a disarmament treaty until the 1997 Ottawa Treaty banning the use of anti-personnel mines.|$|E
50|$|The general discussions {{focused on}} the need to confirm the {{dedication}} of member countries of the Alliance to the aims and ideals of the Treaty in the 25th anniversary of its signature. In addition, there were informal consultations on East-West relations in preparation for US-USSR summit talks on strategic nuclear <b>arms</b> <b>limitations.</b>|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1976, DeLoughry {{served in}} a variety of staff {{intelligence}} assignments at Strategic Air Command Headquarters. In 1976, he was assigned to Defense Intelligence Agency where he served as an advisor to the United States Strategic <b>Arms</b> <b>Limitations</b> Talks delegation, and later as a member of an operations team in the NMCC (National Military Command Center).|$|R
50|$|In February 1927, President Calvin Coolidge {{issued a}} call to the Big Five Powers to meet in Geneva to confront the issue of naval rivalries, as a result of discussions about naval <b>arms</b> <b>limitations</b> at League of Nations {{disarmament}} meetings. Britain and Japan accepted the invitation, but France and Italy (the other nations which had signed the Washington Treaty) declined.|$|R
5|$|The four N3 battleships {{were never}} ordered because the Washington Naval Treaty, an <b>arms</b> <b>limitation</b> treaty under {{negotiation}} at the time, forbade construction of any ship larger than 35,000 tons. Many of {{the aspects of}} their design ultimately were incorporated into the two s, and they are often described as being a cut-down N3. Indeed, the Nelsons received the design designation 'O3', marking them as next in the design sequence, although they used the guns intended for the G3 battlecruisers for cost reasons and {{to comply with the}} Treaty's 16-inch limitation on main armament. Though far from receiving names, the four vessels of the N3 design have since been associated, albeit speculatively, with the names of the four patron saints of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales, those being HMS St. Andrew, HMS St. George, HMS St. Patrick and HMS St. David respectively.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of its large, {{powerful}} ammunition the gun had a tremendous recoil, and its size made portability difficult. The Solothurn firearms company was owned by the German firm Rheinmetall, and used the Swiss company to manufacture arms which were prohibited for manufacture by any German firm, to get around <b>arms</b> <b>limitations</b> imposed upon them {{at the end of the}} first World War.|$|R
50|$|In {{his later}} years, Itō was {{the bane of}} {{civilian}} government through his consistent and conservative use of the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun to inflame public opinion. During the Shōwa financial crisis, he brought out {{the collapse of the}} administration of Prime Minister Wakatsuki Reijirō through a virulent bad-press campaign. He also strongly criticized Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi for signing the London Naval Treaty on <b>arms</b> <b>limitations</b> as infringing on the direct prerogatives of the emperor.|$|R
5000|$|On December 9, 1974, the sesquicentennial {{celebration of}} the Battle of Ayacucho, the site of Simón Bolívar's final victory over Spain, eight Latin American nations stated their {{intention}} to consider <b>arms</b> <b>limitations.</b> Representatives from Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela jointly declared the need to [...] "create conditions which permit effective limitation of armaments {{and put an end}} to their acquisition for offensive military purposes, in order to dedicate all possible resources to economic development." ...|$|R
25|$|The Strategic <b>Arms</b> <b>Limitation</b> Treaty {{began in}} November 1969 in Helsinki. The interim {{agreement}} signed in Moscow in May 1972 froze existing levels of deployment of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and regulated {{the growth of}} submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). As part of the SALT process, the ABM Treaty was also signed.|$|E
25|$|The {{supplemental}} conventions covered {{everything from}} the promotion of agriculture to the limitation of armaments. One, which remained unratified, provided for free trade among all of the states except Costa Rica. The <b>arms</b> <b>limitation</b> agreement set a ceiling {{on the size of}} each nation's military forces (2,500 men for Honduras) and included a United States-sponsored pledge to seek foreign assistance in establishing more professional armed forces.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1960s, the U.S. {{government}} sought {{to establish a}} regional <b>arms</b> <b>limitation</b> agreement in the Middle East. The initiative lost steam in early 1965 after it was disclosed that the U.S. had been indirectly supplying weapons to Israel via West Germany since 1962, {{under the terms of}} a 1960 secret agreement to supply Israel with $80 million worth of armaments. The remainder of the agreement was fulfilled publicly, following its disclosure by the U.S., with Israel receiving shipments of M48 Patton tanks in 1965 and A-4E Skyhawk attack aircraft in 1968.|$|E
50|$|McNamara and President Johnson met on {{the issue}} on 3 November 1966, and McNamara once again {{convinced}} Johnson that the system simply wasn't worth deploying. A follow-up meeting the next month initially appeared to be leading to a deployment being forced upon them, but McNamara managed to convince the president, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and others that the system simply didn't work. Instead, he suggested to the president that they open negotiations with the Soviets on <b>arms</b> <b>limitations.</b> The President asked Dean Rusk to begin negotiations.|$|R
25|$|In 1972, US President Richard Nixon, under {{pressure}} from Senator Jackson, dismissed {{the head of the}} Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) and replaced him with Fred Ikle. Ikle brought in a new team that included Wolfowitz. While at ACDA, Wolfowitz wrote research papers and drafted testimony, as he had previously done at the Committee to Maintain a Prudent Defense Policy. He traveled with Ikle to strategic <b>arms</b> <b>limitations</b> talks in Paris and other European cities. He also helped dissuade South Korea from reprocessing plutonium that could be diverted into a clandestine weapons program.|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} all of these problems, which McNamara {{repeatedly}} made public in a series of talks, the Johnson administration was under intense pressure to deploy an ABM system. In 1966 Congress voted to provide deployment funding for Nike-X, although McNamara refused to use it. As the 1967 elections approached, it became clear {{that this was going to}} be a major election issue. McNamara proposed <b>arms</b> <b>limitations</b> talks with the Soviets to put upper limits on the numbers of ABMs and warheads, but the Glassboro Summit Conference ultimately came to nothing.|$|R
25|$|Special DIA {{task forces}} {{were set up}} to monitor crises such as the Soviet {{invasion}} of Afghanistan, the overthrow of Iranian monarchy, and the taking of U.S. hostages in the American embassy in Tehran in 1979. Also, of serious concern were the Vietnamese takeover in Phnom Penh, the China-Vietnam border war, the overthrow of Idi Amin in Uganda, the North-South Yemen dispute, troubles in Pakistan, border clashes between Libya and Egypt, the Sandinista takeover in Nicaragua, and the Soviet movement of combat troops to Cuba during {{the signing of the}} Strategic <b>Arms</b> <b>Limitation</b> Treaty II.|$|E
25|$|These {{systems were}} used to launch satellites, such as Sputnik, and to propel the Space Race, but they were {{primarily}} developed to create Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) that could deliver nuclear weapons anywhere on the globe. Development of these systems continued throughout the Cold War—though plans and treaties, beginning with the Strategic <b>Arms</b> <b>Limitation</b> Treaty (SALT I), restricted deployment of these systems until, {{after the fall of}} the Soviet Union, system development essentially halted, and many weapons were disabled and destroyed. On January 27, 1967, more than 60 nations signed the Outer Space Treaty, banning nuclear weapons in space.|$|E
25|$|Throughout this period, {{the ending}} of the Cold War led to {{dramatic}} changes in defense funding and priorities. As the need for nuclear weapons was greatly reduced and various <b>arms</b> <b>limitation</b> agreements led to a reduction in warhead count, the US was {{faced with the prospect of}} losing a generation of nuclear weapon designers able to maintain the existing stockpiles, or design new weapons. At the same time, progress was being made on what would become the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which would ban all criticality testing. This would make the reliable development of newer generations of nuclear weapons much more difficult.|$|E

50|$|On June 30, 1921, Eberle took {{command of}} the Pacific Fleet with the rank of admiral. Some two years later, on July 17, 1923, he became Chief of Naval Operations and held the office until {{relieved}} by Admiral Charles F. Hughes on November 14, 1927. During the years he held this post, he reportedly fought to minimize the adverse effect upon the Navy of <b>arms</b> <b>limitations</b> negotiations and from Congressional thrift, hurried the completion of aircraft carriers Lexington and Saratoga, and upheld the Navy's right to maintain its own air arm.|$|R
50|$|Teller {{immediately}} wrote {{another letter}} touting {{the success of}} the concept. This time he wrote to Paul Nitze, the head negotiator of START, and Robert McFarlane, head of the U.S. National Security Council. Nitze was about to begin negotiations on the START I <b>arms</b> <b>limitations</b> talks. Teller stated that Excalibur would be so powerful that the US should not seriously negotiate on any sort of even footing, and that the talks should be delayed because they included limits or outright bans on underground testing that would make further work on Super-Excalibur almost impossible.|$|R
25|$|Major General Mason Patrick {{was again}} chosen by Pershing {{to sort out}} a mess in the Air Service and became the new Chief on October 5. Patrick {{made it clear to}} Mitchell that {{although}} he would accept Mitchell's expertise as counsel, all decisions would be made by Patrick. When Mitchell soon got into a minor but embarrassing protocol rift with Rear Admiral William A. Moffett {{at the start of the}} naval <b>arms</b> <b>limitation</b> conference, Patrick assigned him to an inspection tour of Europe with Alfred V. Verville and Lieutenant Clayton Bissell that lasted the duration of the conference over the winter of 1921–22.|$|E
25|$|Welch {{next was}} a member of the faculty of the National War College briefly before his {{promotion}} to rear admiral in April 1975. He then served in Belgium from 1975 to 1977 on the staff of the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe (SACEUR), United States Army General Alexander M. Haig Jr. From 1977 to 1979, he served in Washington, D.C. as Deputy Director of International Negotiations on the Joint Staff with responsibility to the Joint Chiefs of Staff for arms control talks. During this tour, he played an important role on the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Standing Consultative Commission in 1977 and 1978 and was part of the delegation that accompanied President Jimmy Carter to the SALT II strategic <b>arms</b> <b>limitation</b> talks summit in Vienna, Austria, in June 1979.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union and the United States {{had first}} reached an {{agreement}} on a strategic <b>arms</b> <b>limitation</b> in May 1972 (SALT I) which limited the number of ballistic missiles that each nation could deploy to 2,360 for the Soviets and 1,710 for the Americans. The agreement was not comprehensive, however, as it did not restrict the number of heavy bombers or missiles equipped with multiple warheads (MIRVs) for either country, which by 1974 worked {{to the advantage of}} the United States. Because SALT I was due to expire in October 1977, both the Soviet Union and the United States were interested in reaching a more permanent and comprehensive agreement, but initial efforts made by President Richard Nixon and Gromyko were not successful.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Seitz became unpopular for {{his support of}} the Vietnam war, a {{position}} which most of his colleagues on the President's Science Advisory Committee did not share. In the late 1970s, Seitz also parted company with his scientific colleagues on questions of nuclear preparedness. Seitz was committed to [...] "a muscular military strengthened by the most technologically advanced weaponry", while the scientific community generally supported <b>arms</b> <b>limitations</b> talks and treaties. Seitz was also ardently anti-communist and his support for aggressive weapons programs was a reflection of this.|$|R
