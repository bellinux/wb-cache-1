40|$|We {{select a}} sample of 70378 E/S 0 (early-type) galaxies at 0 <z< 0. 36 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, {{excluding}} disk and star-forming galaxies. We estimate g and r magnitudes in the observer- and rest-frames directly from the SDSS DR 6 spectra; this provides an object-by-object estimate of the k-correction. We use the k-corrections from the spectra to study {{the evolution of the}} rest-frame colour-magnitude relation (CMR) and colour-sigma (velocity dispersion) relation (CsigmaR). The evolution is very sensitive to the k-correction. Both the CMR and CsigmaR evolve blueward with increasing redshift, approximately in agreement with passive evolution models with age approx. 12 Gyr. The slope and zero-point of the CMR depend on whether colours were defined in fixed physical or <b>angular</b> <b>apertures,</b> a consequence {{of the fact that the}} centers of these objects tend to be redder: the relation is steeper for fixed <b>angular</b> <b>apertures.</b> One the other hand, the CsigmaR slope does not show this dependence on the aperture in which the colour was defined, suggesting that colour gradients are correlated with residuals from the sigma-M_r relation. As these residuals are age indicators, our findings suggest that colour gradients correlate with the age of the stellar population.

Most of the important factors that must be understood in x-ray diffractemetry are described in terms of their effect on the intensity, peak-te-backgrom~d ratio, resolution and line shape. These factors are the geometry of the x-ray optical system, the x-ray tube focal spot size, the <b>angular</b> <b>apertures</b> of the primary beam in the focusing and axial planes, the 2 : 1 setting, and the receiving slit.

In this paper, we systematically study the influences of the position and the numerical aperture of the condenser on sample tracking via forward scattering pattern detection. In our experiment, a 60 X condenser is used to form the forward scattering pattern of a sample bead upon a CCD camera. As the bead is transversely shifted at a step size of 30 nm by a PZT XYZ stage, we measure {{the magnitude of the}} corresponding shift of the forward scattering pattern when the 60 X condenser of different <b>angular</b> <b>apertures</b> is placed at various locations along the optical axis.

50|$|For {{very low}} concentrations, the wide {{acceptance}} angles of nonimaging optics avoid {{the need for}} active solar tracking. For medium and high concentrations, a wide acceptance angle {{can be seen as}} a measure of how tolerant the optic is to imperfections in the whole system. It is vital to start with a wide acceptance angle since it must be able to accommodate tracking errors, movements of the system due to wind, imperfectly manufactured optics, imperfectly assembled components, finite stiffness of the supporting structure or its deformation due to aging, among other factors. All of these reduce the initial acceptance angle and, after they are all factored in, the system must still be able to capture the finite <b>angular</b> <b>aperture</b> of sunlight.|$|E
40|$|A {{grazing angle}} {{objective}} on an infrared microspectrometer is studied for quantitative spectroscopy {{by considering the}} angular dependence of the incident intensity within the objective's <b>angular</b> <b>aperture.</b> The assumption {{that there is no}} angular dependence is tested by comparing the experimental reflectance of Si and KBr surfaces with the reflectance calculated by integrating the Fresnel reflection coefficient over the <b>angular</b> <b>aperture</b> under this assumption. Good agreement was found, indicating that the specular reflectance of surfaces can straight-forwardly be quantitatively integrated over the <b>angular</b> <b>aperture</b> without considering non-uniform incident intensity. This quantitative approach is applied to the thickness determination of dipcoated Krytox on gold. The infrared optical constants of both materials are known, allowing the integration to be carried out.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: Optoacoustic imaging {{relies on}} the {{detection}} of ultrasonic waves induced by laser pulse excitations to map optical absorption in biological tissue. A tomographic geometry employing a conventional ultrasound linear detector array for volumetric optoacoustic imaging is reported. The geometry {{is based on a}} translate-rotate scanning motion of the detector array, and capitalizes on the geometrical characteristics of the transducer assembly to provide a large solid <b>angular</b> detection <b>aperture.</b> A system for three-dimensional whole-body optoacoustic tomography of small animals is implemented. METHODS: The detection geometry was tested using a 128 -element linear array (5. 0 ∕ 7. 0 MHz, Acuson L 7, Siemens), moved by steps with a rotation∕translation stage assembly. Translation and rotation range of 13. 5 mm and 180 °, respectively, were implemented. Optoacoustic emissions were induced in tissue-mimicking phantoms and ex vivo mice using a pulsed laser operating in the near-IR spectral range at 760 nm. Volumetric images were formed using a filtered backprojection algorithm. RESULTS: The resolution of the optoacoustic tomography system was measured to be better than 130 μm in-plane and 330 μm in elevation (full width half maximum), and to be homogenous along a 15 mm diameter cross section due to the translate-rotate scanning geometry. Whole-body volumetric optoacoustic images of mice were performed ex vivo, and imaged organs and blood vessels through the intact abdominal and head regions were correlated to the mouse anatomy. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the feasibility of three-dimensional and high-resolution whole-body optoacoustic imaging of small animal using a conventional linear array was demonstrated. Furthermore, the scanning geometry may be used for other linear arrays and is therefore expected to be of great interest for optoacoustic tomography at macroscopic and mesoscopic scale. Specifically, conventional detector arrays with higher central frequencies may be investigated...|$|R

30|$|By contrast, our {{approach}} is to manipulate the <b>angular</b> distribution of <b>aperture</b> radiation by tilting the aperture axis such that the transmitted power is directed into a focal spot at far-field with a reduced amount of solid angle. The directed beaming nature of the slanted nanoslit is the core difference with the conventional nanoslit structure case, in which a horizontally-open nanoslit radiates into the normal direction with larger solid-angle. In our nanoslit-array lens the aperture transmission from the outermost slit is the most glancing-angle propagating, and therefore it carries the largest wave-vector component to a focal plane. It {{should be noted that}} the aperture transmissions emerging from the slits are all in-phase. In general, this phase relationship can be included as a design parameter in a way similar to designing a super-oscillation lens [36]. In the current work, this phase factor was not taken into further optimization. Instead, by manipulating the obliquity factor only we achieved 0.33 λ FWHM of focal spot and 1 – 4 λ focal length. This focal spot accounts for 30 % of total transmitted power, and no major side lobes appear on the focal plane. To the authors’ knowledge, this spot width is even smaller than the best result (0.45 λ FWHM) of beam focusing with a super-oscillation lens reported in the literature [37].|$|R
