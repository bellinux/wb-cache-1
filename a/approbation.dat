5|$|In 1836, Tucker {{completed}} his manuscript {{of a comprehensive}} biography, The Life of Thomas Jefferson, Third President of the United States. He sent his composition to James Madison for his approval, as the latter had assisted in its formation. Tucker included for his sanction a proposed dedication to the recipient. Madison replied with his full <b>approbation</b> and signature on June 26, 1836, just hours before his death the following day.|$|E
5|$|Keable's {{most famous}} {{publication}} {{was his first}} novel, Simon Called Peter, but he produced a prodigious literary output, spanning theological tracts through poetry to travel guides. Simon Called Peters sequel, Recompense, {{was made into a}} film, and his later novels all attracted substantial attention. His writings generally met with much greater popular than critical <b>approbation,</b> and Simon Called Peter was sufficiently incendiary to be banned. The book nonetheless became a contemporary best-seller.|$|E
5|$|The {{purchase}} {{must be made}} at a treaty, as {{in other}} cases. This insures publicity, and affords a protection against fraud. But the proviso does not require that the treaty should be one between the United States and the tribe from whom the purchase is made, as in the cases coming under the first clause of the section. It is sufficient if the purchase is made at a treaty held ‘under {{the authority of the}} United States,’ and in the ‘presence and with the <b>approbation</b> of the commissioner or commissioners of the United States,’ etc.|$|E

5|$|The Mediterranean fleet was by {{now under}} Sir Edward Pellew, and Eyre {{was sent to}} the Spanish coast to support the Spanish forces {{fighting}} the French. Eyre was particularly active off the coast of Valencia and evacuated the garrison of Oropesa del Mar, earning the thanks of General Joaquín Blake y Joyes. On being ordered back to England in 1811 Pellew also wrote a private letter of thanks, following on from his earlier declaration that 'I have to express my complete <b>approbation</b> of Captain Eyre's methods, and have much satisfaction of employing the services of that most excellent officer in the aid of the Valencia patriots.' Eyre arrived in England in 1812, his health having been affected by his five years on a foreign station, and requested and received permission to go ashore. As a mark of his services in the Adriatic and off Spain he was knighted by King George III. Eyre was appointed a Colonel of Marines on 4 June 1814 and was nominated as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath following the expansion of the order on 12 January 1815.|$|E
5|$|The Minerva {{was sent}} {{south to the}} Spanish and Portuguese coasts, where Collier found himself busy suppressing privateering, and the Spanish coastal forts. He was moved on 22 April 1807 to take up command of the 38-gun , and duly {{took part in the}} {{expedition}} to Copenhagen. He received <b>approbation</b> for his services, and the British commander, Admiral James Gambier sent him back to Britain with his despatches. Collier received a knighthood on 19 September 1807, and by 1812 was back in the Bay of Biscay. He was active off the coast of Spain that year, supporting the guerrillas in the countryside under Admiral Sir Home Popham, and was personally involved in some of the land-based operations of the Peninsular War. He was wounded on 1 August 1812 in an attack on the castle at Santander, but though the attack failed, it led to the French withdrawing from the castle, considering it too exposed. Collier's raids were particularly useful in forcing the French forces in the north of the county to attempt to fortify and defend hundreds of small coastal creeks and villages, instead of supporting the forces in the south, allowing Wellington to defeat them.|$|E
25|$|The <b>approbation</b> {{consists}} of a preamble and {{is followed by a}} resolution in two parts.|$|E

5000|$|The {{collection}} of these <b>approbations,</b> which were given in 1749 and 1750, {{is a curious}} monument of the Jewish scholars of northern Italy in the eighteenth century; it includes sonnets and poems in other forms in honor of Lampronti. The following cities are represented by their yeshibahs or rabbis: Venice, Leghorn, Reggio, Verona, Ancona, Padua, Mantua, Casale Monferrato, Modena, Turin, Florence, Alessandria della Paglia, Pesaro, Finale, Lugo, Rovigo. In the second volume are added the <b>approbations</b> of R. Malachi ben Jacob Kohn of Livorno, author of the [...] "Yad Mal'achi," [...] and of three Palestinian scholars stopping at Ferrara.|$|R

25|$|Another {{factor that}} contributed to Brahms's perfectionism was Schumann's early enthusiasm, which Brahms was {{determined}} to live up to. Schumann's early <b>approbation</b> was {{a challenge to the}} composer's self-confidence, and {{may have contributed to the}} delay in producing the First Symphony.|$|E
25|$|On July 31, 1906, the American Archbishop of Manila Jeremiah James Harty {{assisted}} the religious sisters in the canonical erection of Mother Ignacia's congregation, which was previously postponed in {{the filing of}} 1732 due to an incorrect process of petitioning to Rome. On March 17, 1907, Pope Pius X promulgated the Decretum Laudis (English: Decree of Praise) in favour of the congregation's Rules and Constitutions. The Decree of <b>Approbation</b> was granted by Pope Pius XI on March 24, 1931, which made it a Congregation of Pontifical right.

50|$|While several Chabad rabbis denounced Call of the Shofar, others {{defended the}} desire of the program's {{attendees}} for seeking spiritual growth. The existing rabbinical <b>approbations</b> supporting Call of the Shofar were called into question by some within the Chabad community, while individual Chabad members have also spoken out in the organization's favor.|$|R
25|$|Joseph Hansen, a {{historian}} who was {{appalled by the}} witch-craze and those who carried it out, proposed that coauthorship by Sprenger was a falsehood presented by Institoris (Kramer) and that <b>approbation</b> is partially a forgery. This had never been proposed before until Joseph Hansen in nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Naphtali Cohen (1649–1718) was a kabbalist who was tricked {{into giving}} an <b>approbation</b> {{to a book}} by the Sabbatean Nehemiah Hayyun. Provided with this and with other {{recommendations}} secured in the same way, Hayyun traveled throughout Moravia and Silesia, propagating everywhere his Sabbatean teachings. Cohen soon discovered his mistake, and endeavored, without success, to recover his <b>approbation,</b> {{although he did not}} as yet realize the full import of the book. It was in 1713, while Cohen was staying at Breslau (where he acted as a rabbi until 1716), that Haham Tzvi Ashkenazi of Amsterdam informed him of its tenets. Cohen thereupon acted rigorously. He launched a ban against the author and his book, and {{became one of the most}} zealous supporters of Haham Tzvi in his campaign against Hayyun.|$|E

5000|$|This {{book was}} {{formerly}} published as Talmudic Terminology, having been plagiarized from Moses Mielziner's Introduction to the Talmud (1894) as was noted in brief by Rabbi Dr. Marc B. Shapiro. Shortly after publication, {{the book was}} reprinted (1988) with its title page identifying it as an adaptation from M. Mielziner, along with some small changes, and concurrently, the <b>approbations</b> by Rabbis Ovadia Yosef and Aharon Feldman were removed. In the second edition (revised and expanded, 1996) however, the <b>approbations</b> were reinstated and other changes were made including mention of Mielziner on the inside title page (similar to the reprinted first edition) but {{no longer on the}} book's front cover; on the back cover, explicit mention of the book being [...] "an adaptation of one section in Mielziner's book" [...] (i.e., part III); and the omission of chapter 12.|$|R
