5|$|Salander, who {{is under}} state legal {{guardianship}} due to diagnosed mental incompetency, is appointed a new guardian, lawyer Nils Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen), after her previous guardian Holger Palmgren suffers a stroke. Bjurman, a sexual sadist, abuses his authority to extort sexual favors from Salander and violently rapes her, not realizing {{she has a}} hidden video camera on her bag. At their next meeting she stuns him with a taser, rapes him with a dildo, and marks him as <b>a</b> <b>rapist</b> with a tattoo {{on his chest and}} stomach. Threatening to disclose the video recording, she blackmails him into writing a glowing progress report and granting her full control of her money.|$|E

After {{the dog is}} treated by a vet, Julie takes him home while trying to find his owners. <b>A</b> <b>rapist</b> breaks into her house and tries to attack her, but the dog protects her so she decides to adopt him, against the wishes of her boyfriend (Jameson Parker).

Later, when Julie takes the dog to work with her, it attacks a black actress on the set.|$|E
5|$|Noriega {{took great}} care to shape {{perceptions}} of himself. He permitted and encouraged rumors {{that as the}} chief of intelligence, he was in possession of negative information about everybody in the country. Dinges suggests that the impression among some officials that Noriega made money off of every transaction in the country may have been cultivated by Noriega himself. Among opposition leaders in Panama he was seen variously as a sexual pervert, as a sadist, and <b>a</b> <b>rapist.</b> Within U.S. government circles contradictory images abounded; Noriega {{was seen as a}} CIA spy, a drug trafficker, a nationalist supporting Torrijos, an ally of Cuba, and an ally of Oliver North and the Contras. He was perceived as a trusted collaborator in the war against drugs, even as the DEA was investigating him for involvement in smuggling. By the time of his removal he had come to be hated in the U.S., and the invasion was portrayed as an attempt to remove an evil man. Dinges writes that these contradictory images played a large role in the U.S. government's self-contradictory policy towards Noriega.|$|E

25|$|Rape is {{considered}} a crime in all countries, but sharia courts in Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Syria and Tunisia in some cases allow <b>a</b> <b>rapist</b> to escape punishment by marrying his victim, while in other cases the victim who complains is often prosecuted with the crime of Zina (adultery).|$|E
25|$|Frequently, victims may not {{recognize}} {{what happened to}} them was rape. Some may remain in denial for years afterwards. Confusion over whether or not their experience constitutes rape is typical, especially for victims of psychologically coerced rape. Women may not identify their victimization as rape for many reasons such as feelings of shame, embarrassment, non-uniform legal definitions, reluctance to define the friend/partner as <b>a</b> <b>rapist,</b> or because they have internalized victim-blaming attitudes. The public perceives these behaviors as 'counterintuitive' and therefore, as evidence of a dishonest woman.|$|E

25|$|Outside {{the realm}} of formal politics, Moroccan women have been active in various {{advocacy}} projects and legal reforms. Most notably, following the suicide of Amina Filali, a young girl who was forced to marry her rapist, various Moroccan woman organizations, such as , pushed for the reform of Article 475 from Morocco's penal code. Prior to the national campaign, Article 475 was the law cited by the judge in Amina Filali's case that stated <b>a</b> <b>rapist</b> may be acquitted of charges if he marries his victim. The campaign led to the repeal of Article 475 on January 2014.|$|E
25|$|After The Tipping Point, Gladwell {{published}} Blink in 2005. The book {{explains how}} the human unconscious interprets events or cues and how past experiences can lead {{people to make}} informed decisions very rapidly, using examples like the Getty kouros and psychologist John Gottman's research on the likelihood of divorce in married couples. Gladwell's hair was the inspiration for Blink. He stated that he started to get speeding tickets all the time, an oddity considering that he had never gotten one before, and that he started getting pulled out of airport security lines for special attention. In a particular incident, he was accosted by three police officers while walking in downtown Manhattan, because his curly hair matched the profile of <b>a</b> <b>rapist,</b> {{despite the fact that the}} suspect looked nothing like him otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Except for Iran, Lebanon and Bahrain {{which allow}} child marriages, the civil code in Islamic {{majority}} countries {{do not allow}} child marriage of girls. However, with Shari'a personal status laws, Shari'a courts in all these nations {{have the power to}} override the civil code. The religious courts permit girls less than 18 years old to marry. As of 2011, child marriages are common in a few Middle Eastern countries, accounting for 1 in 6 all marriages in Egypt and 1 in 3 marriages in Yemen. However, the average age at marriage in most Middle Eastern countries is steadily rising and is generally in the low to mid 20's for women. Rape is considered a crime in all countries, but Shari'a courts in Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Syria and Tunisia in some cases allow <b>a</b> <b>rapist</b> to escape punishment by marrying his victim, while in other cases the victim who complains is often prosecuted with the crime of Zina (adultery).|$|E

Union said that every rape victim or survivor is a unique situation, and that they all have an idea of how justice should be served.

Stacy {{receives}} a box of someone else's hair outside her door, and Veronica deduces that there have probably been other victims of the rapist, so she goes looking for someone who bought a wig recently, finding no one. Dean informs Veronica that the fraternity has a contest about how many girls they have had sex with, and the recruit with the lowest number of [...] "points" [...] is punished by being forced to shave his head. Veronica tracks down Stacy's rape to someone named [...] "Ice Man." [...] She barges into the fraternity's basement, where she is stopped by two members.|$|E
