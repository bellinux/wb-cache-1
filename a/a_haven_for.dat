5|$|California {{was quickly}} granted {{statehood}} in 1850 and the U.S. military built Fort Point at the Golden Gate and a fort on Alcatraz Island {{to secure the}} San Francisco Bay. Silver discoveries, including the Comstock Lode in Nevada in 1859, further drove rapid population growth. With hordes of fortune seekers streaming through the city, lawlessness was common, and the Barbary Coast section of town gained notoriety as <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> <b>for</b> criminals, prostitution, and gambling.|$|E
5|$|During World War I {{the salon}} became <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> <b>for</b> {{those opposed to}} the war. Henri Barbusse once gave a reading from his anti-war novel Under Fire and Barney hosted a Women's Congress for Peace at the Rue Jacob. Other {{visitors}} to the salon during the war included Oscar Milosz, Auguste Rodin and poet Alan Seeger, who came while on leave from the French Foreign Legion.|$|E

5|$|For much of {{the socialist}} period, the United States was <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> <b>for</b> many Serbian anti-communists living outside Yugoslavia. On 20 June 1979, a Serbian {{nationalist}} named Nikola Kavaja hijacked American Airlines Flight 293 from New York City {{with the intention of}} crashing the Boeing 707 into League of Communists of Yugoslavia headquarters in Belgrade. The aircraft, however, landed in Shannon, Ireland, where Kavaja were arrested.|$|E

5|$|With no {{government}} enforcement from the Chinese or the British {{aside from a}} few raids by the Hong Kong Police, the Walled City became <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> <b>for</b> crime and drugs. It was only during a 1959 trial for a murder that occurred within the Walled City that the Hong Kong government was ruled to have jurisdiction there. By this time, however, the Walled City was virtually ruled by the organised crime syndicates known as triads.|$|E

5|$|Built {{on a site}} long {{favored by}} pre-Columbian peoples, Lock Haven began in 1833 as a timber town and <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> <b>for</b> loggers, boatmen, and other {{travelers}} on the river or the West Branch Canal. Resource extraction and efficient transportation financed much of the city's growth {{through the end of}} the 19thcentury. In the 20thcentury, a light-aircraft factory, a college, and a paper mill, along with many smaller enterprises, drove the economy. Frequent floods, especially in 1972, damaged local industry and led to a high rate of unemployment in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the English Civil War Birmingham's booming economy, its {{expanding}} population, and its resulting high levels of social mobility and cultural pluralism, had seen it develop new social structures very different from those of more established areas. Relationships were built around pragmatic commercial linkages rather than the rigid paternalism and deference of feudal society, and loyalties to the traditional hierarchies of the established church and aristocracy were weak. The town's reputation for political radicalism and its strongly Parliamentarian sympathies saw it attacked by Royalist forces in the Battle of Birmingham in 1643, and it developed into a centre of Puritanism in the 1630s and as <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> <b>for</b> Nonconformists from the 1660s.|$|E
5|$|During the 820s, the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire had {{suffered}} two great losses that destroyed their naval supremacy in the Mediterranean: {{the beginning of}} the Muslim conquest of Sicily and the fall of Crete to Andalusian exiles. These losses ushered in an era where Saracen pirates raided the Christian northern shores of the Mediterranean almost at will. The establishment of the Emirate of Crete, which became <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> <b>for</b> Muslim ships, opened the Aegean Sea up for raids, while their—albeit partial—control of Sicily allowed the Arabs to raid and even settle in Italy and the Adriatic shores. Several Byzantine attempts to retake Crete {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Andalusian conquest, as well as a large-scale invasion in 842/43, failed with heavy losses.|$|E

5|$|England's first {{permanent}} {{settlement in}} the Americas was founded in 1607 in Jamestown, led by Captain John Smith and managed by the Virginia Company. Bermuda was settled and claimed by England {{as a result of}} the 1609 shipwreck of the Virginia Company's flagship, and in 1615 was turned over to the newly formed Somers Isles Company. The Virginia Company's charter was revoked in 1624 and direct control of Virginia was assumed by the crown, thereby founding the Colony of Virginia. The London and Bristol Company was created in 1610 with the aim of creating a permanent settlement on Newfoundland, but was largely unsuccessful. In 1620, Plymouth was founded as <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> <b>for</b> Puritan religious separatists, later known as the Pilgrims. Fleeing from religious persecution would become the motive of many English would-be colonists to risk the arduous trans-Atlantic voyage: Maryland was founded as <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> <b>for</b> Roman Catholics(1634), Rhode Island(1636) as a colony tolerant of all religions and Connecticut(1639) for Congregationalists. The Province of Carolina was founded in 1663. With the surrender of Fort Amsterdam in 1664, England gained control of the Dutch colony of New Netherland, renaming it New York. This was formalised in negotiations following the Second Anglo-Dutch War, in exchange for Suriname. In 1681, the colony of Pennsylvania was founded by William Penn. The American colonies were less financially successful than those of the Caribbean, but had large areas of good agricultural land and attracted far larger numbers of English emigrants who preferred their temperate climates.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with the}} {{prospect}} of a takeover by the pro-communists, UMNO changed their minds about the merger. On 27 May, Malaya's Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, mooted the idea of a Federation of Malaysia, comprising existing Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Brunei and the British Borneo territories of North Borneo and Sarawak. The UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in the Borneo territories would offset Singapore's Chinese population. The British government, for its part, believed that the merger would prevent Singapore from becoming <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> <b>for</b> communism.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the battles}} at Maritsa (1371) and Kosovo field (1389), Serbia began to crumble as the Ottoman Empire conquered its {{southern}} territory. The north resisted through the Serbian Despotate, which had Belgrade as its capital. The city flourished under Stefan Lazarević, son of Serbian prince Lazar Hrebeljanović. Lazarević built a castle with a citadel and towers, of which only the Despot's tower and west wall remain. He also refortified the city's ancient walls, allowing the Despotate {{to resist the}} Ottomans for almost 70 years. During this time, Belgrade was <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> <b>for</b> many Balkan peoples fleeing Ottoman rule, and {{is thought to have}} had a population of 40,000 to 50,000 people.|$|E

These influxes of refugees have placed a strain on the Malawian economy but have also drawn significant inflows of aid from other countries. Donors to Malawi include the United States, Canada, Germany, Iceland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Ireland, the UK and Flanders (Belgium), as well as international institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the European Union, the African Development Bank and UN organisations.|$|E
5|$|O'Leary was {{referring}} to the Lavender Menace, a description by second wave feminist Betty Friedan for attempts by members of the National Organization for Women (NOW) to distance themselves from the perception of NOW as <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> <b>for</b> lesbians. As part of this process, Rita Mae Brown and other lesbians who had been active in NOW were forced out. They staged a protest in 1970 at the Second Congress to Unite Women, and earned the support of many NOW members, finally gaining full acceptance in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The {{closure of}} the border region for nearly 40years created <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> <b>for</b> {{wildlife}} in some places. Although parts of the East German {{side of the border}} were farmed, intensive farming of the kind practised elsewhere in Germany was absent and large areas were untouched by agriculture. Conservationists became aware as early as the 1970s that the border had become a refuge for rare species of animals and plants. Their findings led the Bavarian government to begin a programme of buying land along the border to ensure its protection from development.|$|E

5|$|There are twenty-four {{counties}} and county-equivalents in the U.S. state of Maryland. Though an independent city {{rather than a}} county, the City of Baltimore is considered the equal of a county for most purposes and is a county-equivalent. Many of the counties in Maryland were named for relatives of the Barons Baltimore who were the proprietors of the Maryland colony from its founding in 1634 through 1771. The Barons Baltimore were Catholic, and George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, originally intended that the colony be <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> <b>for</b> English Catholics, though {{for most of its}} history Maryland has had a majority of Protestants.|$|E
5|$|According to Carroll family tradition, Powis {{told his}} new clerk that he {{believed}} King James was receiving bad advice related to the religious turmoil in England. Powis {{was concerned about the}} consequences for English Catholics. He supposedly spoke on Carroll's behalf to an associate of his, Charles Calvert, proprietor of the Maryland colony. Charles Calvert's grandfather, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, was a former member of Parliament and Secretary of State to James I, whose Catholicism had effectively ended his political career. Intense lobbying by George Calvert had led to the granting of a hereditary charter to the Calvert family. The Maryland colony was established in the 1630s on land granted by this charter. It was intended as <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> <b>for</b> English Catholics and other religious minorities. Powis may have encouraged Carroll to emigrate to Maryland with the hope that the younger man's career would come to greater fulfillment in a place with less religious conflict than England at the time.|$|E
5|$|Cofresí's sudden {{success was}} an oddity, {{nearly a century}} {{after the end of}} the Golden Age of Piracy. By this time, joint {{governmental}} efforts had eradicated rampant buccaneering by Anglo-French seamen (primarily based on Jamaica and Tortuga), which had turned the Caribbean into <b>a</b> <b>haven</b> <b>for</b> pirates attacking shipments from the region's Spanish colonies; this made his capture a priority. By late 1823, the pursuit on land probably forced Cofresí to move his main base of operations to Mona; the following year, he was often there. This base, initially a temporary haven with Barrio Pedernales his stable outpost, became more heavily used. Easily accessible from Cabo Rojo, Mona had been associated with pirates for more than a century; it was visited by William Kidd, who landed in 1699 after fleeing with a load of gold, silver and iron. A second pirate base was found at Saona, an island south of Hispaniola.|$|E
