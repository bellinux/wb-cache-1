5|$|Seaborg {{also became}} {{an expert in}} dealing with noted Berkeley {{physicist}} Robert Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer had <b>a</b> <b>daunting</b> reputation, and often answered a junior man's question before it had even been stated. Often the question answered was more profound than the one asked, but of little practical help. Seaborg learned to state his questions to Oppenheimer quickly and succinctly.|$|E

5|$|The massive {{amount of}} {{exponentially}} growing sequence data is <b>a</b> <b>daunting</b> challenge that {{is complicated by the}} complexity of the metadata associated with metagenomic projects. Metadata includes detailed information about the three-dimensional (including depth, or height) geography and environmental features of the sample, physical data about the sample site, and the methodology of the sampling. This information is necessary both to ensure replicability and to enable downstream analysis. Because of its importance, metadata and collaborative data review and curation require standardized data formats located in specialized databases, such as the Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD).|$|E

As in 1796, the Federalist members of Congress caucused in the spring of 1800 and nominated Adams and Charles C. Pinckney. The Democratic–Republicans meanwhile nominated Jefferson and Burr, their candidates in the previous election.|$|E
5|$|Although by {{the close}} of the 1860s, Denver {{residents}} could look with pride at their success establishing a vibrant supply and service center, the decision to route the nation's first transcontinental railroad through Cheyenne, rather than Denver, threatened the prosperity of the young town. <b>A</b> <b>daunting</b> 100 miles away, citizens mobilized to build a railroad to connect Denver to the transcontinental railroad. Spearheaded by visionary leaders including Territorial Governor John Evans, David Moffat, and Walter Cheesman, fundraising began. Within three days, $300,000 had been raised, and citizens were optimistic. Fundraising stalled before enough was raised, forcing these visionary leaders {{to take control of the}} debt-ridden railroad. Despite challenges, on June 24, 1870, citizens cheered as the Denver Pacific completed the link to the transcontinental railroad, ushering in a new age of prosperity for Denver.|$|E
5|$|It was <b>a</b> <b>daunting</b> challenge. The Ho Chi Minh Trail (controlled by the 259th PAVN Logistical Group) {{consisted}} of a labyrinth of dirt roads, bicycle and foot paths, bypasses, storage areas, workshops, and truck parks that stretched from the mountain passes of North Vietnam, through the panhandle of Laos, and into east central Cambodia. The entire system was elaborately camouflaged from aerial observation and was constantly being maintained, expanded, and improved. By 1968 PAVN was relying less on manual labor and increasingly utilizing modern construction equipment. The CIA estimated during the year the 259th Group was using 20 bulldozers, eleven road graders, three rock crushers and two steamrollers on the network. Manual labor was still provided by an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 Laotians (mostly pressed into service) and North Vietnamese volunteers.|$|E

5|$|The British {{evacuated}} Philadelphia to New York City before d'Estaing's arrival, {{and their}} North American fleet {{was no longer}} in the river when his fleet arrived at Delaware Bay in early July. D'Estaing decided to sail for New York, but its well-defended harbour presented <b>a</b> <b>daunting</b> challenge to the French fleet. Since the French and their American pilots believed his largest ships were unable to cross the sandbar into New York harbour, their leaders decided to deploy their forces agaynst British-occupied Newport, Rhode Island. While d'Estaing was outside the harbour, British Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Clinton and Vice-Admiral Lord Richard Howe dispatched a fleet of transports carrying 2,000 troops to reinforce Newport via Long Island Sound; these reached their destination on 15 July, raising the size of Major General Sir Robert Pigot's garrison to over 6,700 men.|$|E
5|$|In the {{qualifier}} round, in atrocious {{conditions the}} Crusaders defeated the Highlanders 17-0. The game was notable for the Crusaders defence, which kept the highly-talented Highlanders scoreless. The Crusaders then defeated the Chiefs comfortably 27-13, repaying earlier playoff losses to the team. The Crusaders faced the Lions in the final, and {{owing to the}} Lions holding home advantage, had to fly nearly 12,000km. The Crusaders confronted <b>a</b> <b>daunting</b> task to win the 2017 title. The Crusaders would have to battle a formidable Lions team, altitude and 61,000 Lions fans in the fortress of Ellis Park Stadium. The Crusaders started strongly with two tries, jumping out to a 12-0 lead. In the 38th minute Kwagga Smith took out David Havili in the air, causing Havili to fall dangerously. Smith was given a red card. At half time the Crusaders led 15-3. Kieran Read scored a try immediately after half time to extend the lead to 22-3. However, the travel, altitude and fast pace of the game took a toll on the Crusaders. The attacking Lions scored two tries {{to reduce the deficit}} to 25-17. But the defence of the Crusaders held out giving the Crusaders a record eighth title 25-17, while avenging last years result.|$|E
