40|$|PRINCIPLES OF VALIDATION OF DIAGNOSTIC ASSAYS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES. <b>Assay</b> <b>validation</b> {{requires}} {{a series of}} inter-related processes. <b>Assay</b> <b>validation</b> is an experimental process: reagents and protocols are optimized by experimentation to detect the analyte with accuracy and precision. <b>Assay</b> <b>validation</b> is a relative process: its diagnostic sensitivity and diagnostic specificity are calculated relative to test results obtained from reference animal populations of known infection/exposure status. <b>Assay</b> <b>validation</b> is a conditional process: classification of animals in the target population as infected or uninfected is conditional upon how well the reference animal population used to validate the assay represents the target population; accurate predictions of the infection status of animals from test results (PV+ and PV−) are conditional upon the estimated prevalence of disease/infection in the target population. <b>Assay</b> <b>validation</b> is an incremental process: confidence in the validity of an assay increases over time when use confirms that it is robust as demonstrated by accurate and precise results; the assay may also achieve increasing levels of validity as it is upgraded and extended by adding reference populations of known infection status. <b>Assay</b> <b>validation</b> is a continuous process: the assay remains valid only insofar as it continues to provide accurate and precise results as proven through statistical verification. Therefore, the work required for validation of diagnostic assays for infectious diseases does not end with a time-limited series of experiments based on a few reference samples rather, to assure valid test results from an assay requires constant vigilance and maintenance of the assay, along with reassessment of its performance characteristics for each unique population of animals {{to which it is}} applied...|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{to describe the}} kinetics of enzyme production by the filamentous fungus Trichoderma harzianum P 49 P 11 was developed using a low cost substrate as main carbon source (pre-treated sugarcane bagasse). The model describes the cell growth, variation of substrate concentration and production of three kinds of enzymes (cellulases, beta-glucosidase and xylanase) in different sugarcane bagasse concentrations (5; 10; 20; 30; 40 g L- 1). The 10 g L- 1 concentration was used to validate the model {{and the other to}} parameter estimation. The model for enzyme production has terms implicitly representing induction and repression. Substrate variation was represented by a simple degradation rate.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to review the most {{important}} topics about the antiophidic sera sterility, including obtaining methods, sterilization procedures and clean room control using Vital Brazil Institute (VBI) as an example. Bibliographical research was performed through Medline, Lilacs, PubMed, ISI and the Fundação Oswaldo Cruz - RJ and VBI Libraries, from 1960 to 2009. The antiophidic sera for human use are immunobiologic products produced in Brazil by three national laboratories, including VBI. Due to the parenteral use, these products should be sterile and pyrogen-free, which demands the microbiological control during the whole fabrication process.

Bone morphogenic protein and Stat 3 signaling regulate Hepcidin's transcription. Hepcidin is a potential drug target for patients with iron overload syndromes because its levels are inappropriately low in these individuals. To generate a tool for identifying small molecules that modulate Hepcidin expression, we stably transfected human hepatocytes (HepG 2) cells with a reporter construct containing 2. 7 kb of the human Hepcidin promoter upstream of a firefly reporter gene.

40|$|Over {{recent years}} the role of {{biomarkers}} in anticancer drug development has expanded across a spectrum of applications ranging from research tool during early discovery to surrogate endpoint in the clinic. However, in Europe when biomarker measurements are performed on samples collected from subjects entered into clinical trials of new investigational agents, laboratories conducting these analyses become subject to the Clinical Trials Regulations. While these regulations are not specific in their requirements of research laboratories, quality assurance and in particular <b>assay</b> <b>validation</b> are essential. This review, therefore, focuses on a discussion of current thinking in biomarker <b>assay</b> <b>validation.</b> Five categories define the majority of biomarker assays from ‘absolute quantitation' to ‘categorical'.

40|$|Metabonomic and {{metabolomic}} {{studies are}} increasingly utilized for biomarker identification in different fields, including biology of infection. The confluence of improved analytical platforms {{and the availability}} of powerful multivariate analysis software have rendered the multiparameter profiles generated by these omics platforms a user-friendly alternative to the established analysis methods where the quality and practice of a procedure is well defined. However, unlike traditional <b>assays,</b> <b>validation</b> methods for these new multivariate profiling tools have yet to be established. We propose a validation for models obtained by CE fingerprinting of urine from mice infected with the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni. We have analysed urine samples from two sets of mice infected in an inter-laboratory experiment where different infection methods and animal husbandry procedures were employed in order to establish the core biological response to a S. mansoni infection. CE data were analysed using principal component analysis. Validation of the scores consisted of permutation scrambling (100 repetitions) and a manual validation method, using a third of the samples (not included in the model) as a test or prediction set. The validation yielded 100 % specificity and 100 % sensitivity, demonstrating the robustness of these models with respect to deciphering metabolic perturbations in the mouse due to a S. mansoni infection. A total of 20 metabolites across the two experiments were identified that significantly discriminated between S. mansoni-infected and noninfected control samples. Only one of these metabolites, allantoin, was identified as manifesting different behaviour in the two experiments.

40|$|The {{chemicals}} {{contained in}} this document were selected as reference chemicals for prevalidation studies in the EDSP <b>assay</b> <b>validation</b> program because they produced a well-documented positive response {{in one or more}} Tier 1 assays by an identified mode of action. Some chemicals may act by more than one mode of action. It should be noted that this is not intended to be a list of endocrine disruptors, and it should not be concluded a chemical on this list is necessarily an endocrine disruptor since that designation also requires an association with an adverse effect identified in a Tier 2 study. Although some chemicals on this list have been studied extensively, others have not been studied in Tier 2 assays. The chemicals in the attached chart do not represent all of the chemicals used in the prevalidation or validation of the assays but, in general, those that are common across several assays. The chemicals used in prevalidation appear in the following table grouped into eight modes of action:, androgen, antiandrogen, estrogen, antiestrogen, hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, steroidogenesis, aromatase, and thyroid. Some chemicals appear more than once because they act by more than one mode of action. For the most part, chemicals used in tests in the general literature have not been included in these tables as such studies raise questions about comparability of protocols and data.

Sentinel assays for pluripotency could maximize available resources for generating iPSCs. Neural rosettes represent a primitive neural tissue that is unique to differentiating PSCs and commonly used to identify derivative neural/stem progenitors. Here, neural rosettes were used as a sentinel assay for pluripotency in selection of candidates to advance to <b>validation</b> <b>assays.</b> Candidate iPSCs were generated from independent populations of amniotic cells with episomal vectors. Phase imaging of living back up cultures showed neural rosettes in 2 of the 5 candidate populations. Rosettes were immunopositive for the Sox 1, Sox 2, Pax 6 and Pax 7 transcription factors that govern neural development in the earliest stage of development and for the Isl 1 / 2 and Otx 2 transcription factors that are expressed in the dorsal and ventral domains, respectively, of the neural tube in vivo. Dissociation of rosettes produced cultures of differentiation competent neural/stem progenitors that generated immature neurons that were immunopositive for βIII-tubulin and glia that were immunopositive for GFAP. Subsequent <b>validation</b> <b>assays</b> of selected candidates showed induced expression of endogenous pluripotency genes, epigenetic modification of chromatin and formation of teratomas in immunodeficient mice that contained derivatives of the 3 embryonic germ layers. Validated lines were vector-free and maintained a normal karyotype for more than 60 passages. The credibility of rosette assembly as a sentinel assay for PSCs is supported by coordinate loss of nuclear-localized pluripotency factors Oct 4 and Nanog in neural rosettes that emerge spontaneously in cultures of self-renewing validated lines. Taken together, these findings demonstrate value in neural rosettes as sentinels for pluripotency and selection of promising candidates for advance to <b>validation</b> <b>assays...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractAntibody-based {{drugs such}} as {{infliximab}} (IFX) are effective {{for the treatment of}} inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other immune-mediated disorders. The development of antibodies against these drugs may result in unfavorable consequences, including the loss of drug efficacy, hypersensitivity reactions, and other adverse events. Therefore, accurate monitoring of serum drug and anti-drug antibody levels should be an important part of therapy for patients being treated with an antibody-based drug. Current methods for the assessment of anti-drug antibodies and drug levels, involving various bridging ELISA and radioimmunoassay techniques, are limited by their sensitivity, interference, and/or complexity. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a non-radiolabeled homogeneous mobility shift assay (HMSA) to measure the antibodies-to-infliximab (ATI) and IFX levels in serum samples. Full method validation was performed on both the ATI- and IFX-HMSA, and the clinical sample test results were also compared with those obtained from a bridging ELISA method to evaluate the difference in performance between the two <b>assays.</b> <b>Validation</b> of the ATI-HMSA revealed a lower limit of quantitation of 0. 012 μg/mL in serum. The linear range of quantitation was 0. 029 – 0. 54 μg/mL. The intra- and inter-assay precision was less than 20 % of coefficient of variation (CV), and the accuracy (% error) of the assay was less than 20 %. In serum samples, ATI as low as 0. 036 μg/mL can be measured, even in the presence of 60 μg/mL of IFX in the serum. Sera from 100 healthy subjects were tested to determine the cut point of the assay. ATI-positive samples that had been previously analyzed by using a bridging ELISA from 100 patients were also measured by the new method. There was a high correlation between the two methods for ATI levels (p< 0. 001). Significantly, the new method identified five false-positive samples from the bridging ELISA method. Validation of the mobility shift IFX assay also showed high assay sensitivity, precision and accuracy. The HMSA method may also be applied to other protein-based drugs to accurately detect serum drug and anti-drug antibody levels...|$|R
