It is sometimes called a “native hypervisor” or a “bare metal hypervisor”.

As such, a mobile device based on the type 1 hypervisor can optimize the performance {{of each of the}} virtual machines. As for the type 2 hypervisor, it runs as an application on top of the host mobile operating system environment at the second level and on the guest operation systems that operate on the <b>next</b> <b>above</b> the type 2 hypervisor. The performance and compromise of the guest OS are heavily dependent on the host OS. It is inherently less secure and may run slower than native apps because it does not work at the hardware level. The hypervisor technology has a drawback in {{that it has to be}} partnered and perform the work with OEMs. Recently, many smartphones have not been able to offer the hardware level of virtualization [20].|$|R
