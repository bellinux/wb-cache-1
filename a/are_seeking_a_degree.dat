The Austronesian Cultural Festival in Taitung City is one means by which community members promote aboriginal culture.

40|$|Thesis (M. A., Education (Higher Education Leadership)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. The {{researcher}} reviewed Maslow???s (1943, 1970) motivation theory, Schlossberg???s (1989) transition theory, and Knowles???s (1990) {{adult learning}} theory. Adults seek self-actualization through education, and education {{is cause for}} transition. Adults will endure transition when education allows for a self-directed learning environment relevant to the students??? employment. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the motivations, challenges, and supports of adults pursuing graduate degrees. By understanding the adult learner and their necessities, the researcher hopes that identification of challenges, barriers, and conflicts along with supports can lead to proactive planning and resource development by educators for the adult graduate student. An online questionnaire was distributed to the past and present students of the Freedom University higher education leadership graduate degree program. There were 49 respondents, with 35 females and 14 males. Three participants were aged 18 - 24 and the remainder were aged 25 - 64. The research presented in this study indicated motivations such as upward mobility, an increase in salary and responsibility, and love of learning. Respondents <b>were</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>a</b> graduate <b>degree</b> to <b>be</b> qualified for a position of greater responsibility and greater salary. The study identified challenges such as lack of childcare support, time management issues, and trouble keeping up with the homework/reading. Supports included employers, significant others, and fellow students. This information should lead to proactive planning and resource development for the adult graduate student.

40|$|In {{order to}} satisfy an {{increasing}} global hunger for meat, dairy, and eggs, livestock production is increasingly becoming industrialized worldwide. This agricultural transformation, however, is revealing animal {{health and welfare}} problems. A solution to this dilemma may lie in implementing new technology complimentary to industrial production that is founded in animal biology and capable of identifying and correcting health and welfare problems. However people educated in biology are not aware of the possibilities of modern technology and people developing new technology are not familiar with the world of biology. The main objective of the 4 year BioBusiness project is to train biologically educated people (veterinarians and biologists) to collaborate with technology driven people (bio-engineers and computer engineers). The project is being conducted by a strong Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) related consortium formed by 10 partners of research institutions, universities, and companies. A total of 11 early stage researchers were recruited as Marie-Curie Fellows to work as a team for the development of high-tech products in the following areas: 1) optimal embryonic development in chickens; 2) lameness in dairy cows; 3) aggressive behaviour in pigs. Each fellow has a supervisor responsible for scientific and research education. The fellows affiliated with academic partners <b>are</b> <b>seeking</b> <b>a</b> PhD <b>degree</b> in this project. All fellows are trained in animal applied research, technology, product development, and marketing. The progress of the fellows is monitored by a group of expert researchers under 3 specific conditions: a) individual academic/scientific progress; b) industrial progress in product development activities and; c) individual development by the network and synergy on group activities. The research outcome of the project will be 11 well-trained people who understand the innovative potential of PLF from an {{animal health and welfare}} position. Moreover they will develop innovative product concepts and the corresponding business models. Together, farmers will have a tool to improve their business and animal health and welfare through PLF technology. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Computer {{integrated}} manufacturing systems {{have emerged in}} response to the requirements for greater flexibility, productivity, high precision and quality of the product. As the computer technology advances, the manufacturing industry <b>is</b> now <b>seeking</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>degree</b> of production automation. Numerical control (NC) machining stands out in this regard. There is pressing need for computer-based simulation models {{that can be used for}} the purpose of analyzing the machining performance during the programming stage. Research has been done in this thesis to develop a system model which can describe the generation of machined surfaces during an end milling process. In the first step, an ideal surface topography is constructed based on the kinematics of a vertical milling machine tool. Building on the ideal surface topography, factors such as the parallel axial offset of an end mill (runout), tool static deflection and vibration are taken into consideration in the surface texture generation. Consequently, the developed mathematical model represents a realistic picture on how the machined surface is produced during an end milling process. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic nature of surface generation during an end milling process, the method of design of experimentation is employed to investigate three system parameters, namely, the feedrate, helix angle, and runout, and their effects on the surface topography generation. Computer simulations based on a 23 factorial design are conducted in this thesis work to obtain the predicted values of indices such as roughness average (Ra) and Peak-to-Valley (PTV) that characterize the finish quality of machined surfaces. Experimental verification has been done in this thesis work. Samples are made on a Matsuura 510 Machining Center. These samples are inspected and data are recorded at the National Institute of Standards and Technology at Gaithersburg, Maryland. For a similar machining condition, the results predicted through computer simulation are compared with the results obtained from the direct measurements taken on the samples, showing good agreements...|$|R
