5|$|Alonso and Arteta were ambitious <b>and</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> playing {{alongside}} {{each other}} for Real Sociedad when they were older. Though they attended different schools, the two young players joined forces at the local youth side Antiguoko, playing games at the weekend. Their performances {{attracted the attention of}} scouts from top Spanish sides and the young Donostiarras separated ways, ending nine years of friendly rivalry, as Alonso went to Real Sociedad and Arteta moved to Catalan giants Barcelona. Alonso's move to Real Sociedad, however, was not a companionless one, as his older brother Mikel, who had also become an adept player, had joined the club one year earlier.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Alfonso Cuarón had a {{predilection for}} space {{programs}} <b>and</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> becoming an astronaut and would watch live moon landings in television.
