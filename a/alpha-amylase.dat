25|$|The {{salivary glands}} in mammals are exocrine glands, glands with ducts, that produce saliva, which is {{composed}} of several components including amylase, a digestive enzyme that breaks down starch into maltose and glucose. In humans and some other mammals the secretion is <b>alpha-amylase,</b> also known as ptyalin.|$|E
25|$|Beta-D-glucans, usually {{referred}} to as beta-glucans, comprise a class of indigestible polysaccharides widely found in nature in sources such as grains, barley, yeast, bacteria, algae and mushrooms. In oats, barley and other cereal grains, they are located primarily in the endosperm cell wall. The oat beta-glucan health claim applies to oat bran, rolled oats, whole oat flour and oatrim, a soluble fraction of <b>alpha-amylase</b> hydrolyzed oat bran or whole oat flour.|$|E
25|$|Amylase is {{an enzyme}} in saliva that is {{responsible}} for the breakdown of starch into monosaccharides, and one type of amylase is encoded by the <b>alpha-amylase</b> gene (AMY1). The AMY1 locus, as well as the amylase enzyme, {{is one of the most}} extensively studied and sequenced gene in the human genome. Its homologs are also found in other primates and therefore it is likely that the primate AMY1 gene is ancestral to the human AMY1 gene and was adapted early in primate evolution. AMY1 is a particularly interesting gene to examine as it is one of the most well studied genes which has wide range of variable numbers of copies throughout different human populations. The AMY1 gene is also one of the few genes that had been studied that displayed convincing evidence which correlates its protein function to its copy number. Copy number is known to alter transcription as well as translation levels of a particular gene, however research has shown that the relationship between protein levels and copy number is variable. In the AMY1 genes of European Americans it is found that the concentration of salivary amylase is closely correlated to the copy number of the AMY1 gene. As a result, it was hypothesized that the copy number of the AMY1 gene is closely correlated with its protein function, which is to digest starch.|$|E
25|$|AMY2B (<b>Alpha-Amylase</b> 2B) is a {{gene that}} codes a protein that assists with {{the first step in}} the {{digestion}} of dietary starch and glycogen. An expansion of this gene in dogs would enable early dogs to exploit a starch-rich diet as they fed on refuse from agriculture. In a study in 2014, the data indicated that the wolves and dingo had just two copies of the gene and the Siberian Husky that is associated with hunter-gatherers had just three or four copies, whereas the Saluki that is associated with the Fertile Crescent where agriculture originated had 29 copies. The results show that on average, modern dogs have a high copy number of the gene, whereas wolves and dingoes do not. The high copy number of AMY2B variants likely already existed as a standing variation in early domestic dogs, but expanded more recently with the development of large agriculturally based civilizations. This suggests that at the beginning of the domestication process, dogs may have been characterized by a more carnivorous diet than their modern-day counterparts, a diet held in common with early hunter-gatherers. A later study indicated that because most dogs had a high copy number of the AMY2B gene but the arctic breeds and the dingo did not, that the dog's dietary change may not have been caused by initial domestication but by the subsequent spread of agriculture to most - but not all - regions of the planet.|$|E

50|$|To analyze a grain sample {{it first}} {{needs to be}} ground to a powder; a flour sample can be {{analyzed}} as is. The sample is put into the test tube; distilled water is added, and the tube is then shaken vigorously to achieve a homogeneous mix. The tube is then placed in the boiling water bath, and the operator begins to stir the sample. Simultaneously the starch begins to gelatinize and the slurry becomes more viscous. The mixing ensures the gelatinization is homogeneous in the slurry, crucial for consistent test results. An additional effect of the high temperature is that the <b>alpha-amylase</b> enzyme contained in the grain begins to break the starch down into glucose and maltose, thereby reducing the viscosity of the slurry. The amount of starch break-down is directly proportionate to the <b>alpha-amylase</b> activity, meaning that the higher {{the activity of the}} <b>alpha-amylase,</b> the lower the viscosity will be.|$|E

5000|$|Oral {{bacterium}} {{already in}} one's mouth removes the sugar containing components from glycoproteins in saliva. This removal of sugar forms a precipitate or a non-soluble by-product. The protein precipitate formed in saliva is normally rich in calcium {{and low in}} solubility. Also, <b>alpha-amylase</b> contains a significant level of sialic acid. When <b>alpha-amylase</b> combines with saliva, the enzymes hydrolyze and release the sialic acid, forming another water-insoluble precipitate.

50|$|Sprouting or pre-harvest {{germination}} {{is caused}} by damp or rainy weather conditions during {{the final stage of}} maturation of the crop. The germination causes an accelerated production of the starch degrading enzyme <b>alpha-amylase.</b> Severely sprouted grain kernels can contain several thousand times the amount of enzyme of sound unsprouted kernels. Because of this, very low levels of severely sprouted kernels mixed into sound wheat can cause the entire lot to exhibit significant amylase activity. Since its introduction in the early 1960s, the FN test has become a world standard in the grain and flour milling industries for measuring <b>alpha-amylase</b> activity in wheat, durum wheat, triticale, rye and barley, as well as milled products made from these grains.|$|E
50|$|It is most {{commonly}} {{produced by the}} digestive enzyme <b>alpha-amylase</b> (a common enzyme in human saliva) on amylose in starch.

50|$|Even {{though the}} drugs {{have a similar}} {{mechanism}} of action, there are subtle differences between acarbose and miglitol. Acarbose is an oligosaccharide, whereas miglitol resembles a monosaccharide. Miglitol is fairly well absorbed by the body, as opposed to acarbose. Moreover, acarbose inhibits pancreatic <b>alpha-amylase</b> in addition to alpha-glucosidase.|$|E
50|$|Acarbose {{inhibits}} enzymes (glycoside hydrolases) {{needed to}} digest carbohydrates, specifically, alpha-glucosidase enzymes {{in the brush}} border of the small intestines, and pancreatic <b>alpha-amylase.</b> Pancreatic <b>alpha-amylase</b> hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine, whereas the membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the small intestine. Inhibition of these enzyme systems reduces the rate of digestion of complex carbohydrates. Less glucose is absorbed because the carbohydrates are not broken down into glucose molecules. In diabetic patients, the short-term effect of these drug therapies is to decrease current blood glucose levels; the long-term effect is a reduction in HbA1c level. This reduction averages an absolute decrease of 0.7%, which is a decrease of about 10% in typical HbA1c values in diabetes studies.|$|E
50|$|After 60 {{seconds of}} mixing, the stirrer is {{dropped from the}} top of the test tube, and the {{operator}} measures the time it takes for the stirrer to reach the bottom. That time, measured in seconds, is the Falling Number. When the stirrer is dropped, its speed and thus the time it takes it to fall to the bottom, will be determined by the viscosity of the slurry. In other words, the more sprouted the grain was the higher the <b>alpha-amylase</b> activity will be. The higher the <b>alpha-amylase</b> activity the lower the viscosity of the slurry. The lower the viscosity of the slurry the faster the stirrer will fall to the bottom. That is why more sprouted grain results in a lower Falling Number as Falling Number is the time it takes the stirrer to fall to the bottom.|$|E
50|$|Icodextrin is not {{significantly}} metabolised inside the peritoneum. Instead, it is absorbed slowly (40% after 12 hours) {{into the bloodstream}} via the lymph vessels. There it is broken down into oligosaccharides by the enzyme <b>alpha-amylase.</b> In patients with intact kidney function, both icodextrin and its fragments are excreted via the kidney by glomerular filtration.|$|E
50|$|In addition, various genetically {{engineered}} micro-organisms are routinely used {{as sources of}} enzymes for the manufacture {{of a variety of}} processed foods. These include <b>alpha-amylase</b> from bacteria, which converts starch to simple sugars, chymosin from bacteria or fungi, which clots milk protein for cheese making, and pectinesterase from fungi, which improves fruit juice clarity.|$|E
50|$|A starch iodine gel {{contains}} agarose and starch. Samples {{are added}} to the gel and allowed to diffuse through the gel overnight. Visualization is accomplished by adding iodine to the gel which stains the starch in the gel blue. When saliva is present, the <b>alpha-amylase</b> breaks down the starches, creating a clear circle around the sample well.|$|E
5000|$|Sprout {{damage is}} {{undesirable}} germination of wheat kernels that occurs on mature, unharvested wheat when wet field conditions persist {{just prior to}} and during the harvest. Mature wheat that has been cut and left lying in the field prior to threshing is particularly vulnerable to sprout damage. Early cold weather in Canada often forces wheat producers there to cut and windrow their crop to allow for drying. Wet conditions can then cause widespread sprout damage. If it has occurred, there is a dramatic increase of the enzyme <b>alpha-amylase.</b> The Falling Number test {{is a measure of}} the presence of this enzyme. A high falling number indicates that the wheat is sound and satisfactory for most baking processes. A low falling number indicates that harmful sprouting has occurred and is suggestive of reduced baking quality. In bread, too much <b>alpha-amylase</b> activity will cause wet sticky bread crumb with large voids in the loaf and too little causes dry crumble bread crumb and high loaf density.|$|E
50|$|Enzymes {{containing}} this domain {{belong to}} family 13 (CAZY GH_13) of the glycosyl hydrolases. The maltogenic <b>alpha-amylase</b> is an enzyme which catalyses hydrolysis of (1-4)-alpha-D-glucosidic linkages in polysaccharides {{so as to}} remove successive alpha-maltose residues from the non-reducing ends of the chains in the conversion of starch to maltose. Other enzymes in this family include neopullulanase, which hydrolyses pullulan to panose, and cyclomaltodextrinase, which hydrolyses cyclodextrins.|$|E
50|$|Maltase-glucoamylase is an {{alpha-glucosidase}} digestive enzyme. It {{consists of}} two subunits with differing substrate specificity.
