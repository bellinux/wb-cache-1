5|$|Twelve-year-old Keith Bennett {{vanished}} {{on his way}} to his grandmother's {{house in}} Longsight, Manchester, early in the evening of 16 June 1964, four days after his birthday. Hindley lured him into her Mini Pick-up—which Brady was sitting in the back of—by asking for the boy's help in loading some boxes, after which she said she would drive him home. She drove to a lay-by on Saddleworth Moor as she and Brady had previously arranged, and Brady went off with Bennett, supposedly looking for a lost glove. Hindley kept watch, and after about 30minutes or so Brady reappeared, alone and carrying a spade that he had hidden there earlier. When Hindley <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> he had killed Bennett, Brady said that he had sexually assaulted the boy and strangled him with a piece of string.|$|E

It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E

5|$|On 6June, Wolfe {{received}} {{a message from}} Arnold informing him that the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted a raid to be conducted against Japan as soon as possible. The goals of this operation were to relieve pressure on Chinese forces which were being attacked by the Japanese and to support the invasion of Saipan. Arnold's message also <b>asked</b> <b>how</b> many B-29s could be dispatched on 15 and 20June. At the time, the first raid on Japan was tentatively scheduled for 23June, when sufficient supplies {{were expected to be}} available in China to support 100 B-29 sorties. Wolfe replied stating that 50 B-29s could be used on 15June and 55 if the operation was conducted on the 20th of the month. Arnold regarded these numbers as too low, and directed that a raid by at least 70 B-29s be conducted against Japan on 15June. Following this order, XX Bomber Command's B-29s and transport aircraft embarked on an intensive effort to move fuel to China. Further fuel supplies were made available to the heavy bombers by reducing the activities of USAAF fighter units based in China. During the same period the command's ground crews reconditioned as many B-29s as possible to improve their reliability.|$|E
