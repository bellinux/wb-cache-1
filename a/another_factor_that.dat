5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> fishers select for are forest floors {{that have}} {{large amounts of}} coarse woody debris. In western forests, where fire {{regularly}} removes understorey debris, fishers show a preference for riparian woodland habitat. Fishers tend to avoid areas with deep snow. Habitat is also affected by snow compaction and moisture content.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> helped Tchaikovsky's music {{become popular}} was {{a shift in}} {{attitude}} among Russian audiences. Whereas they had previously been satisfied with flashy virtuoso performances of technically demanding but musically lightweight compositions, they gradually began listening with increasing appreciation of the music itself. Tchaikovsky's works were performed frequently, with few delays between their composition and first performances; the publication from 1867 onward of his songs and great piano music for the home market also helped boost the composer's popularity.|$|E
5|$|It {{is a sign}} of Edward's {{high regard}} for Lancaster that he would bestow such {{extensive}} privileges on him. The two men were second cousins through their great-grandfather Henry III and practically coeval (Edward was born in 1312), so it is natural to assume that a strong sense of camaraderie existed between them. <b>Another</b> <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> might have influenced the king's decision was the fact that Henry had no male heir, so the grant was made for the Earl's lifetime only, and not intended to be hereditary.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>factor</b> is <b>that</b> a {{large number}} of LODDs - motor vehicle {{collisions}} - are preventable.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{important}} <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> {{influences the}} design of the aircraft are the regulations put forth by national aviation airworthiness authorities.|$|R
50|$|Yet, <b>another</b> <b>factor</b> is <b>that</b> {{political}} {{centers of}} gravity have changed. These centers of gravity may revolve around nationalism, religion, or family or clan honor.|$|R
5|$|According to {{archaeologist}} Karl Lorenz, who excavated several Natchez settlements, <b>another</b> <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> complicated {{relations between}} the Natchez and the colonists {{was the fact that}} the French did not well understand the Natchez political structure. The French assumed that the Great Sun, the chief of the Grand Village, also held sway over all the other Natchez villages. In truth, each village was semi-autonomous, and the Great Sun's power only extended to the villages of Flour and Tioux (with which the Grand Village was allied) and not to the three pro-British villages of White Apple, Jenzenaque and Grigra. When the Great Sun died in 1728 and was succeeded by his inexperienced nephew, the pro-British villages became more powerful than the pro-French villages centered at Natchez.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> {{can also}} {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar. If the center of mass for the steering mechanism is in front of the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the elevation of the center of mass {{also contribute to}} the dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E
5|$|Larvae pupate 5 to 10cm {{below the}} soil surface. Pupae are brown in color; they measure 5.5mm wide and 17 to 22mm long. The biggest {{environmental}} factor {{that affects the}} pupal developmental rate is temperature, primarily soil temperature. This is because proper insulation facilitates development, and soil temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius correlate to higher pupal mortality. <b>Another</b> <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> influences pupal development is soil moisture. Pupal mortality is high in wet soil, where the moisture level is between 18 and 25 percent. Dehydration {{can also lead to}} high death rates among pupae, if soil moisture is as low as 1 to 2 percent.|$|E
50|$|Different {{operators}} {{have different}} configurations for the inactivity timers, {{which leads to}} differences in energy consumption. <b>Another</b> <b>factor</b> is <b>that</b> not all operators use the PCH states.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Another</b> <b>factor</b> was <b>that</b> Japan was {{entering}} an economic recession {{due to the}} effects of the [...] "bubble economy", and all Japanese industries were experiencing a decline in manufactured products.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>factor</b> is <b>that</b> {{insecure}} attachments {{in childhood}} have shown to predispose the individuals to difficulties in forming secure attachments in adulthood and to having heightened responses to rejection and loss.|$|R
5|$|Tapping felt {{acting on}} the new show went a little easier when filming Carter scenes with Bill Dow ("Bill Lee"), {{with whom she had}} {{previously}} worked on Stargate SG-1. She said <b>another</b> <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> made acting on Atlantis easier was the welcoming cast and crew of the series. Tapping's hair was longer than it was during her time on SG-1, and the military approved of the change {{as long as it was}} worn up. To save money on visual effects, the crew built set pieces to represent some of the buildings on M7R-227 and placed them in front of the puddle jumper set. Another measure taken as a substitute to visual effects was to cast mime artists as the frozen Asurans.|$|E
5|$|In general, 20th-century historians from Palestine and the Arab world, and Palestinian and Arab nationalists, communists and leftists of all stripes, held a {{negative}} {{view of the}} Ottoman era, which they associated with backwardness, corruption and tyranny. According to historian Adel Manna, this uniformly negative perception of the Ottomans and the high regard for Muhammad Ali as a modernizer and a liberator of Arab lands from the Ottomans, which he sought to unite under his rule, influenced the later historiography of the 1834 revolt. <b>Another</b> <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> influenced the historians of the 20th century was the limited availability of primary sources from Palestine {{at the time of}} the revolt. Most primary Arabic accounts of the events were kept by Egypt's bureaucracy at the time. Other accounts were from European travelers or consuls in the area, while there were no known written 19th-century accounts by people living in Palestine's towns and villages.|$|E
5|$|Some psychologists {{believe that}} 'while object {{permanence}} alone may not predict communicative achievement, object permanence {{along with several}} other sensorimotor milestones, plays a critical role in, and interacts with, the communicative development of children with severe disabilities'. This was observed in 2006, in a study recognizing where the full mastery of object permanence {{is one of the}} milestones that ties into a child's ability to engage in mental representation. Along with the relationship with language acquisition, object permanence is also related to the achievement of self-recognition. This same study also focused specifically on the effects that Down syndrome has on object permanence. They found that the reason why the children that participated were so successful in acquiring object permanence, was due to their social strength in imitation. Along with imitation being a potential factor in the success, <b>another</b> <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> could impact children with Down syndrome could also be the willingness of the child to cooperate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>factor</b> was <b>that</b> she was {{somewhat}} unconventional in her relationships, {{for she was}} uncertain {{as to how to}} relate sexually to her male employers in many cases, and men in general.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{transcription}} <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> {{may be a}} downstream {{target of}} Ngn3 is Nkx2.2 because it’s often coexpressed with it. Studies have shown that disrupting Nkx2.2 expression results in problems with α and β cell differentiation.|$|R
25|$|According {{to former}} NHL President Gil Stein, <b>another</b> <b>factor</b> was <b>that</b> the Karmanos/Rutherford group wanted to pay only $29million before {{starting}} play, while the Esposito group {{was one of}} the few willing to pay the entire $50million expansion fee up front.|$|R
5|$|Speaking {{about the}} move from Namco Bandai to Nintendo, Sugiura commented {{that it was a}} {{challenge}} to only be developing games for a single group of consoles, but then Nintendo endorsed the challenge to Monolith Soft with incentives such as making a particular game within given hardware specifications, with Nintendo providing the company time and resources to accomplish that. <b>Another</b> <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> changed within Monolith Soft's development process was Nintendo's increased quality control, which would moot any project that did not have the desired quality for their systems. The sense of challenge was also echoed by Takahashi, who described both Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles X as being partially defined by self-imposed challenges to the development team when creating the environments on limited gaming hardware. Monolith Soft's scope and goals are often attributed to Takahashi's drive and ambition. While commonly associated with Japanese role-playing games (JRPGs), Monolith Soft focuses more on making role-playing games for a worldwide audience.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> brought Cardus to England in 1948 was the {{prospect}} of succeeding Newman, whose retirement as chief music critic of The Sunday Times {{was assumed to be}} imminent. However, Newman had no intention of retiring, and {{made it clear that he}} would resent any successor-designate looking over his shoulder. Feeling slighted, Cardus resigned from the paper and accepted an offer from the London Evening Standard to be its music critic. This new appointment was short-lived; Cardus's lengthy and discursive concert reviews were incompatible with this paper's style, and were ruthlessly cut by subeditors. At the end of 1948 he was back in Australia, proclaiming his intention to settle there permanently. This determination, too, was brief; the lure of London life proved irresistible. Because of the commercial success of his Autobiography, published in 1947, and the immediate commissioning of a second autobiographical work, Cardus was not under immediate financial pressure. He left Australia again in the spring of 1949, and although he spent the English winter of 1950–51 in Australia, writing about the 1950–51 England v. Australia Test series for the Sydney Morning Herald, London was thereafter his permanent home. Here he worked as a freelance writer, in which role he resumed his association with The Manchester Guardian. In December 1951 he was appointed the paper's London music critic, on a permanent salaried basis.|$|E
25|$|Smoking is <b>another</b> <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> {{increases}} {{the occurrence of}} periodontitis, directly or indirectly, and may interfere with or adversely affect its treatment.|$|E
50|$|Bureau 13 {{tends to}} have a weird, humorous or satirical bent to it. <b>Another</b> <b>factor</b> is <b>that</b> the {{characters}} are usually mundane civilians rather than commandos or Men In Black. They don't usually {{have a lot of}} military or espionage skills.|$|R
50|$|According {{to former}} NHL President Gil Stein, <b>another</b> <b>factor</b> was <b>that</b> the Karmanos/Rutherford group wanted to pay only $29 million before {{starting}} play, while the Esposito group {{was one of}} the few willing to pay the entire $50 million expansion fee up front.|$|R
25|$|In {{historical}} China, {{the notion}} of hundred surnames (百家姓) was a crucial identity of Han people. Besides the common culture and writings, common origins rooted in the surnames was <b>another</b> major <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> contributed towards Han Chinese identity.|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the economy of the city is tourism, which has been increasing at a steady rate since 2007.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> {{may have}} contributed to Cochems' story fading from the public's memory was the {{decision}} of St. Louis University to discontinue intercollegiate football in 1949.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> {{contributes}} to the immigration question is Canada's low birth rate (see List of countries by birth rate). The theory is that new residents can assist in meeting future government obligations relating to pay-as-you-go liabilities.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{noteworthy}} <b>factor</b> is <b>that</b> {{this was}} the first heavy metal album released by a Sri Lankan band.|$|R
40|$|Recreation {{has been}} often {{considered}} {{in the region of}} social welfare. However, the meaning or the position of recreation is ambiguous in the field at present. The {{purpose of this study is}} twofold: First, the <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> are common to the former and present concepts of recreation will be extracted and investigated: second, the concept of recreation will be considered from the standpoint of social welfare. Although many factors common to these concepts are extracted, recreation in the point of view of social welfare has <b>another</b> <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> cannot be understood only with the former concept of recreation, Therefore the concept in the region of social welfare needs to be interpreted in a broader sense...|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> <b>factor</b> was <b>that</b> every {{agency had}} {{different}} timeframes and formats for submittal of Concept Papers. The agencies also had different requirements for environmental compliance, such as NEPA and other regulations. These factors {{made it very}} difficult for applicants to submit funding requests to different agencies.|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> {{contributed to}} Brahms's perfectionism was Schumann's early enthusiasm, which Brahms was {{determined}} to live up to. Schumann's early approbation was {{a challenge to the}} composer's self-confidence, and {{may have contributed to the}} delay in producing the First Symphony.|$|E
25|$|Divorce is also <b>another</b> <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> {{can take}} a toll on both {{children}} and adults alike. Divorcees may suffer from emotional adjustment problems due {{to a loss of}} intimacy and social connections. Newer statistics show that the negative effects of divorce have been greatly exaggerated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> makes {{periodontitis}} {{a difficult}} disease to {{study is that}} human host response can also affect the alveolar bone resorption. Host response to the bacterial-mycotic insult is mainly determined by genetics; however, immune development may play some role in susceptibility.|$|E
50|$|Christopher Hines' The Adonis Factor is a {{follow up}} to <b>another,</b> The Butch <b>Factor,</b> <b>that</b> tackled gay culture and masculinity.|$|R
5000|$|Sex in age at {{maturity}} is <b>another</b> possible <b>factor</b> <b>that</b> {{can affect}} OSR. If it takes one sex longer to mature than the other, {{it would be}} expected to see a biased OSR of the sex that matured faster, most of the time.|$|R
50|$|Factory {{production}} of the Mite ended in 1954. Leading up to this, the company was losing $1000 on each plane, which accelerated {{the development of the}} M20. <b>Another</b> <b>factor</b> was <b>that</b> Continental had ceased {{production of}} the engine used in the Mite {{due to a lack of}} demand.|$|R
