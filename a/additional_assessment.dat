Mr. Hastings would not pocket his bribe of 40,000l. for himself without letting the Company in as a sharer and accomplice. For the province of Rungpore, the object to which I mean in this instance to confine your attention, 7,000l. a year was added. But lest this avowed increase of rent should seem to lead to oppression, great and religious care was taken in the covenant so stipulated with Debi Sing, that this increase should not arise from any <b>additional</b> <b>assessment</b> whatsoever on the country, but solely from improvements in the cultivation, and the encouragement to be given to the landholder and husbandman. But as Mr. Hastings's bribe, of a far greater sum, was not guarded by any such provision, it was left to the discretion of the donor in what manner he was to indemnify himself for it.|$|E

5000|$|CPEIR {{methodology}} {{is generally}} {{based on the}} World Bank’s Public Expenditures Review exercise. However, unlike the PERs, the CPEIR process has a distinct characteristics of analyzing also the institutional framework of climate change public finance. This add-on to the standard PER process {{is due to the}} cross-cutting nature of climate change related finances which requires an <b>additional</b> <b>assessment</b> of the institutional framework for a topic that is cross-sector. The cross-cutting nature of the climate change finance also has {{a significant impact on the}} process of the review. Unlike the typical PERs where the data on public expenditures is generally available and relatively low efforts are required to obtain the required general financial data on planned and actual government budget expenditures, the climate change expenditures are not explicitly recorded by the government statistics systems (such as the GFS classifications). Therefore, unlike PERs with most of the efforts put on analyzing the effectiveness and efficiency of public expenditures, CPEIR processes spend most of the efforts on gathering and triangulation of the financial data on climate change expenditures. This additional step that requires tremendous efforts and resources adds an invaluable importance to CPEIRs - basically, CPEIRs provide information that governments do not possess themselves, despite the fact that CPEIRs mostly use the raw government data on budgets.|$|E
