25|$|Larceny is the {{unlawful}} taking of another person's property {{with the intention}} to deprive the owner of it. If the stolen object is above a large value, then it is considered a felony and is called a grand theft. A petty theft is stealing and object with a small value which would pass as a misdemeanor. If a person has a lost item in possession, and a reasonable method exists for finding the owner, they must return it or it would be considered larceny. For example, if one finds <b>a</b> <b>wallet</b> with an ID in it, it is their duty to find a method to {{return it to the}} owner. Shoplifting and attempted shoplifting fall under this category.|$|E

Transit riders can add value or a monthly pass to their cards at machines located at MBTA stations and vehicles, MBTA ticket offices, retail sales terminals at select outlets and online.|$|E

500|$|The {{panorama}} {{books are}} not Potter's best efforts, but do demonstrate {{her ability to}} pare text and illustrations to essentials.
