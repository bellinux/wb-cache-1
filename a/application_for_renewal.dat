40|$|This {{regulatory}} analysis {{provides the}} supporting information for a proposed rule that will amend the Nuclear Regulatory Commission`s environmental review requirements <b>for</b> <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>renewal</b> {{of nuclear power}} plant operating licenses. The objective of the proposed rulemaking is to improve regulatory efficiency by providing for the generic evaluation of certain environmental impacts associated with nuclear plant license renewal. After considering various options, the staff identified and analyzed two major alternatives. With Alternative A, the existing regulations would not be amended. This option requires that environmental reviews be performed under the existing regulations. Alternative B is to assess, on a generic basis, {{the environmental impacts of}} renewing the operating license of individual nuclear power plants, and define the issues that will need to be further analyzed on a case-by-case basis. In addition, Alternative B removes from NRC`s review certain economics-related issues. The findings of this assessment are to be codified in 10 CFR 51. The staff has selected Alternative B as the preferred alternative...|$|R
5000|$|The debts of many trusts became significant; forced mergers {{of solvent}} and debt-laden trusts became frequent, {{and by the}} 1870s it was {{feasible}} for Parliament to close the trusts progressively without leaving an unacceptable financial burden on local communities. From 1871, all <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>renewal</b> were sent to a Turnpike Trust Commission. This arranged for existing Acts to continue, but {{with the objective of}} discharging the debt, and returning the roads to local administration, which was by then by highway boards. The Local Government Act of 1888 gave responsibility for maintaining main roads to county councils and county borough councils. When a trust was ended, there were often great celebrations as the gates were thrown open. The assets of the trust, such as tollhouses, gates and sections of surplus land beside the road were auctioned off to reduce the debt, and mortgagees were paid at whatever rate in the pound the funds would allow.|$|R
