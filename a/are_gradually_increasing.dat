50|$|Labour {{costs have}} been rising across Asia as Asians now {{are more willing to}} pay a premium for the {{products}} and services they receive and thus causing production cost to increase. Many countries in Asia have seen a rapid rise in wages since the late 2000s. One factor contributing to the wage rises is due to the shift of labour from agricultural work into more productive jobs in industry, labour productivity has increased quickly thus leading to wage growth. Workers will demand for better wages as Singapore's economic growth and living costs <b>are</b> <b>gradually</b> <b>increasing.</b> Businesses will thus face pressure on their profit margins as rising labour costs leads to higher production costs.|$|E

5000|$|Balwen Welsh Mountain sheep {{originate}} from one small area of Wales [...] - [...] the Tywi valley. This area was hit badly {{by the very}} severe British winter of 1946-1947, and the breed was nearly wiped out [...] - [...] only one ram was amongst the survivors. All modern Balwen sheep are therefore presumably descended from this one ram, although {{it is possible that}} some of the ewes may have been in lamb to rams that did not survive the winter. Outcrossing with other types of Welsh Mountain sheep may also have occurred, and this would have increased the genetic diversity of the breed. During the 1950s and 1960s a steady increase took place, and in the 1970s people outside the valley began to take an interest in the breed. The Balwen Welsh Mountain Breed Society was formed in 1985, and numbers <b>are</b> <b>gradually</b> <b>increasing</b> further.|$|E
