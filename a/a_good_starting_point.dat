Flanders argues that if animals are excluded from basic justice, as John Rawls held, they can be defended on metaphysical grounds (what Rawls refers to as on the basis of comprehensive doctrines, as opposed to the public reasons which must be used for arguments in the political realm). This is potentially liberating for animal advocates. Nonetheless, Flanders argues, animal issues may be matters of basic justice insofar as they affect humans or the animals themselves have rights.

Publishers Weekly called it a [...] "bitingly farcical look at lawyers {{at the bottom of the}} food chain". CNN described the book as an original perspective of [...] "the best and worst the American system of justice has to offer". Louis Bayard of The Washington Post, who described himself as someone who abandoned Grisham after his first three novels, noted that this book might be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>starting</b> <b>point</b> for those who have tired of Grisham.

Publishers Weekly also notes that the fairy tale ending is not really in keeping with the introduction's dark humor. Rick Arthur of The United Arab Emirates publication The National describes the book unfavorably as a cross between prior Grisham works The Street Lawyer and The King of Torts and similarly describes the protagonist unfavorably to those of The Firm and The Rainmaker. Geoffrey Wansell of the Daily Mail presented one of the more favorable reviews describing the book as [...] "a spectacular return to form, displaying the clarity and passion that were there in his first thrillers but seemed to ebb away."

Our model provides <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start</b> <b>point</b> to understand the Kondo problem in a Luttinger liquid {{as well as in}} a strongly correlated host. The Kondo coupling constant $J$ can take arbitrary values, which allows us to study the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kondo problems simultaneously. It is shown that both the Kondo coupling and the scalar potential effectively reconcile the spin dynamics at low temperatures. Generally, the impurity spin is split into two ghost spins via coupling effect. The residual entropy, which can be exactly derived for the present model, is strongly interaction-dependent. This hints the local spin configuration is very complicated and very different from that in the conventional Kondo problem. An unscreening phenomenon in the antiferromagnetic regime is found, which reveals the impurity potential plays an important role for the Kondo problem in a strongly correlated host. The low temperature specific heat is calculated in the framework of local Landau-Luttinger liquid theory. Comment: 17 revtex pages, detail and extended version of PRL 79, 1901 (1997...|$|R

Meghan Sullivan of IGN called the story, music and visuals [...] "great", and greatly enjoyed the gameplay systems despite mission repetition and a slow online interface. Alexa Ray Corriea of GameSpot greatly enjoyed the changes to gameplay and its strategy despite little variation in playable maps, and enjoyed the character interactions while noting that the dialogue became overly melodramatic in places.

40|$|A {{key problem}} in {{multimedia}} systems is the faithful reproduction of color. One {{of the main}} reasons why this is a complicated issue are the different color reproduction technologies used by the various devices; displays use easily modeled additive color mixing, while printers use a subtractive process, the characterization of which is much more complex than that of self–luminous displays. In order to resolve these problems several processing steps are necessary, one of which is accurate device characterization. Our study examines different learning algorithms for one particular neural network technique which already {{has been found to be}} useful in related contexts – namely radial basis function network models – and proposes a modified learning algorithm which improves the colorimetric characterization process of printers. In particular our results show that is possible to obtain good performance by using a learning algorithm that is trained on only small sets of color samples, and use it to generate a larger look–up table (LUT) through use of multiple polynomial regression or an interpolation algorithm. We deem our findings to be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start</b> <b>point</b> for further studies on learning algorithms used in conjunction with this problem...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{new method}} for {{computing}} {{the intersection of}} a ray and a NURBS surface is presented. The method is based on Newton iteration for a system of nonlinear equations, but its convergence is accelerated by using the polynomial extrapolation. Additionally, a ray is defined to be the intersection of two planes, which are usually non-orthogonal, so that theoperations are significantly reduced. A trapezoid prism is adopted for the bounding box enclosing the patch as tightly as possible. It can be used both for getting <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>start</b> <b>point</b> for the Newton iteration and for efficiently detecting whether a ray intersects a patch. The method proposed for speeding up ray tracing NURBS surfaces can reduce both the iteration steps and arithmetic operations, thus much CPU time is saved.

The acceleration techniques with extrapolation presented for solution {{to a system of}} nonlinear equations {{can also be used to}} speed up tracing the intersection of two parametric surfaces as well as others that need Newton iteration. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.
