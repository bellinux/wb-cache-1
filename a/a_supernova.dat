5|$|Some {{media outlets}} tied {{the fact that}} the red supergiant star Betelgeuse would undergo <b>a</b> <b>supernova</b> {{at some point in the}} future to the 2012 phenomenon. However, while Betelgeuse was {{certainly}} in the final stages of its life, and would die as <b>a</b> <b>supernova,</b> there was no way to predict the timing of the event to within 100,000 years. To be a threat to Earth, <b>a</b> <b>supernova</b> would need to be no further than 25 light years from the Solar System. Betelgeuse is roughly 600 light years away, and so its supernova would not affect Earth. In December 2011, NASA's Francis Reddy issued a press release debunking the possibility of <b>a</b> <b>supernova</b> occurring in 2012.|$|E
5|$|A recent (2005) {{hypothesis}} is that the star of Bethlehem was <b>a</b> <b>supernova</b> or hypernova occurring in the nearby Andromeda Galaxy. Although {{it is difficult to}} detect <b>a</b> <b>supernova</b> remnant in another galaxy, or obtain an accurate date of when it occurred, supernovae remnants have been detected in Andromeda.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>supernova</b> is a cataclysmic {{explosion}} of a star. Within the Milky Way galaxy, supernova explosions occur on average once every 40 years. During {{the history of}} the Earth, multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with radioisotopes and possibly impact the biosphere. Gamma rays emitted by <b>a</b> <b>supernova</b> react with nitrogen in the atmosphere, producing nitrous oxides. These molecules cause a depletion of the ozone layer that protects the surface from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. An increase in UV-B radiation of only 10–30% is sufficient to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the phytoplankton that form the base of the oceanic food chain. <b>A</b> <b>supernova</b> explosion at a distance of 26light years will reduce the ozone column density by half. On average, <b>a</b> <b>supernova</b> explosion occurs within 32light years once every few hundred million years, resulting in a depletion of the ozone layer lasting several centuries. Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one gamma ray burst that will {{have a significant impact on}} the planet's biosphere.|$|E

5|$|A near-Earth {{supernova}} is <b>a</b> <b>supernova</b> {{close enough}} to the Earth to have noticeable effects on its biosphere. Depending upon the type and energy of the supernova, it could be as far as 3000light-years away. Gamma rays from <b>a</b> <b>supernova</b> would induce a chemical reaction in the upper atmosphere converting molecular nitrogen into nitrogen oxides, depleting the ozone layer enough to expose the surface to harmful ultraviolet solar radiation. This has been proposed as the cause of the Ordovician–Silurian extinction, which resulted in the death of nearly 60% of the oceanic life on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Several unusual supernovae and impostors {{have been}} {{compared}} to Eta Carinae as examples of its possible fate. One of the most compelling is SN 2009ip, a blue supergiant which underwent <b>a</b> <b>supernova</b> impostor event in 2009 with similarities to Eta Carinae's Great Eruption, then an even brighter outburst in 2012 {{which is likely to}} have been a true supernova. SN 2006jc, some 77 million light years away in UGC 4904, in the constellation Lynx, also underwent <b>a</b> <b>supernova</b> impostor brightening in 2004, followed by a magnitude 13.8 type Ib supernova, first seen on 9 October 2006.

5|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 20th century astronomers {{increasingly}} {{turned to}} computer-controlled telescopes and CCDs for hunting supernovae. While such systems are popular with amateurs, there are also professional installations such as the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope. Recently the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS) project has begun using a network of neutrino detectors to give early warning of <b>a</b> <b>supernova</b> in the Milky Way galaxy. Neutrinos are particles that are produced in great quantities by <b>a</b> <b>supernova,</b> and they are not significantly absorbed by the interstellar gas and dust of the galactic disk.|$|E
5|$|However if {{the white}} dwarf merges with another white dwarf (a very rare event), it will {{momentarily}} exceed the limit and begin to collapse, again raising its temperature past the nuclear fusion ignition point.

5|$|Many Christians {{believe the}} star was a miraculous sign {{to mark the}} birth of the Christ (or Messiah).

40|$|Abstract The {{concept of}} a Universe {{undergoing}} an acceleration in its expansion rate and predicating the existence of dark energy is based on observed deficits in brightness of Type 1 <b>a</b> <b>supernovae</b> at high redshifts, amounting to � m ∼ 0. 3 – 0. 5. We show {{that the effect of}} intergalactic graphite whiskers of radii in the general range 0. 03 – 0. 07 µm and lengths in excess of ∼ 5 µm will be to mimic the effects of dark energy in the redshift magnitude relation for Type 1 <b>a</b> <b>supernovae.</b> The mean intergalactic density of whiskers required for such an effect is ∼ 3 × 10 − 34 gcm − 3, about 10 − 5 of the critical closure density...|$|R

500|$|If core {{collapse}} {{occurs during}} a supergiant phase when the star {{still has a}} hydrogen envelope, the result is <b>a</b> TypeII <b>supernova.</b> The rate of mass loss for luminous stars depends on the metallicity and luminosity. [...] Extremely luminous stars at near solar metallicity will lose all their hydrogen before they reach core collapse and so will not form <b>a</b> TypeII <b>supernova.</b> [...] At low metallicity, all stars will reach core collapse with a hydrogen envelope but sufficiently massive stars collapse directly to a black hole without producing <b>a</b> visible <b>supernova.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Sun {{does not}} have enough mass to explode as <b>a</b> <b>supernova.</b> Instead it will exit the main {{sequence}} in approximately 5 billion years and start to turn into a red giant. As a red giant, the Sun will grow so large that it will engulf Mercury, Venus, and probably Earth.|$|E
5|$|The known {{history of}} {{supernova}} observation {{goes back to}} 185 CE, when supernova SN 185 appeared, the oldest appearance of <b>a</b> <b>supernova</b> recorded by humankind. Several additional supernovae within the Milky Way galaxy have been recorded since that time, with SN 1604 being the most recent supernova to be observed in this galaxy.|$|E
5|$|The {{overwhelming}} probability is {{that the}} next supernova observed in the Milky Way will originate from an unknown white dwarf or anonymous red supergiant, very likely not even {{visible to the naked}} eye. Nevertheless, the prospect of <b>a</b> <b>supernova</b> originating from an object as extreme, nearby, and well-studied as Eta Carinae arouses great interest.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{development}} of the telescope, there have only been five supernovae seen in the last millennium. Compared to a star's entire history, the visual appearance of <b>a</b> galactic <b>supernova</b> is very brief, perhaps spanning several months, so that the chances of observing one is roughly once in a lifetime. Only {{a tiny fraction of the}} 100 billion stars in a typical galaxy have the capacity to become <b>a</b> <b>supernovae,</b> restricted to either having sufficient large enough mass or under extraordinarily rare kinds of binary star in configurations containing white dwarf stars.|$|R
50|$|In May 2011 <b>a</b> Type Ia <b>supernova,</b> 2011df, was {{detected}} in NGC 6801. 2015af, <b>a</b> Type II <b>supernova</b> {{was discovered in}} August 2015.|$|R
50|$|SN 2010bj, <b>a</b> Type II-P <b>supernova,</b> was {{detected}} in February 2010, and SN 2015I, <b>a</b> Type Ia <b>supernova</b> {{was detected}} in May 2015.|$|R
5|$|A typical core {{collapse}} supernova at {{the distance}} of Eta Carinae would peak at an apparent magnitude around −4, similar to Venus. A SLSN could be five magnitudes brighter, potentially the brightest supernova in recorded history (currently SN 1006). At 7,500 light-years from the star {{it is unlikely to}} directly affect terrestrial lifeforms, as they will be protected from gamma rays by the atmosphere and from some other cosmic rays by the magnetosphere. The main damage would be restricted to the upper atmosphere, the ozone layer, spacecraft, including satellites, and any astronauts in space. At least one paper has projected that complete loss of the Earth's ozone layer is a plausible consequence of <b>a</b> <b>supernova,</b> which would result in a significant increase in UV radiation reaching Earth's surface from the Sun. This would require a typical supernova to be closer than 50 light-years from Earth, and even a potential hypernova would need to be closer than Eta Carinae. Another analysis of the possible impact discusses more subtle effects from the unusual illumination, such as possible melatonin suppression with resulting insomnia and increased risk of cancer and depression. It concludes that <b>a</b> <b>supernova</b> of this magnitude would have to be much closer than Eta Carinae to have any type of major impact on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a further}} tiny energy gain could be {{extracted}} by synthesizing 62Ni, {{which has a}} marginally higher binding energy than 56Fe, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process. Element production in supernovas and distribution on Earth greatly favor iron over nickel, and in any case, 56Fe still has a lower mass per nucleon than 62Ni due to its higher fraction of lighter protons. Hence, elements heavier than iron require <b>a</b> <b>supernova</b> for their formation, involving rapid neutron capture by starting 56Fe nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{supernova}} {{has been}} observed in the Milky Way since 1604, it appears that <b>a</b> <b>supernova</b> exploded in the constellation Cassiopeia about 300 years ago, around the year 1667 or 1680.

However it can be observed {{in other parts of the}} spectrum, and it is currently the brightest radio source beyond our solar system.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the extent to}} which correlated distortions of the luminosity distance-redshift relation due to large-scale bulk flows limit the precision with which cosmological parameters can be measured. In particular, peculiar velocities of type 1 <b>a</b> <b>supernovae</b> at low redshifts may prevent a sufficient calibration of the Hubble diagram necessary to measure the dark energy equation of state to better than 10 %, and diminish the resolution of the equation of state time-derivative projected for planned surveys. We consider similar distortions of the angular-diameter distance, as well as the Hubble constant. We show that the measurement of correlations in the large-scale bulk flow at low redshifts using these distance indicators may be possible with a cumulative signal-to-noise ratio of order 7 in a survey of 300 type 1 <b>a</b> <b>supernovae</b> spread over 20, 000 square degrees.

5|$|Another key {{aspect of}} SIM Lite's mission was {{determining}} {{the upper and}} lower limits of star's masses. Today, scientists understand that there are limits to the how small or large a star can be. Objects that are too small lack the internal pressure to initiate thermonuclear fusion, which is what causes a star to shine. These objects are known as brown dwarfs and represent {{the lower end of the}} stellar mass scale. Stars that are too large become unstable and explode in <b>a</b> <b>supernova.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris {{may have}} been formed near the Scorpius-Centaurus Association.

40|$|The {{desire to}} extend the Hubble Diagram to higher redshifts than the range of current Type 1 <b>a</b> <b>Supernovae</b> {{observations}} has prompted investigation into spectral correlations in gamma-ray bursts (GBRs), {{in the hope that}} standard candle-like properties can be identified. In this paper, we discuss the potential of these new ‘cosmic rulers’ and highlight their limitations by investigating the constraints that current data can place on an alternative Cosmological model in the form of Conformal Gravity. By fitting current Type 1 <b>a</b> <b>Supernovae</b> and GRB data to the predicted luminosity distance redshift relation of both the standard Concordance Model and the Conformal Gravity, we show that currently neither model is strongly favoured at high redshift.
