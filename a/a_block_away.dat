Although the West Side Stadium plan was rejected by city and state planning agencies, the 7 Subway Extension plan received approval to move ahead, as New York political leaders {{wanted to see the}} warehouse district west of Eighth Avenue and north of 34th Street redeveloped as part of the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project, and subway service was to be an essential part of that effort. The extension also serves the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, which was expanded in 2008–2014 and is located <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>away</b> from the station entrances.|$|E

25|$|The spacious lots were {{considered}} highly desirable {{because they were}} close to Drake Park, which runs along {{the east side of}} the Deschutes River. In addition, many home sites had choice views of the Cascade Mountain peaks. The area was only <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>away</b> from Bend's downtown business district so the city hall, public library, and local Catholic, Methodist, and Episcopalian churches were within easy walking distance. The district was also within walking distance of the Brooks-Scanlon and Shevlin-Hixon lumber mills. As a result, the Drake Park district quickly became the preferred neighborhood for the city's most prominent businessmen.|$|E

25|$|Other buses {{depart from}} stops on {{surrounding}} streets, {{some of which}} are up to <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>away</b> from the station. The lack of more integrated bus facilities {{has been the subject of}} criticism, particularly due to the fact that the original design for the transport centre included an underground bus station, which was cut from the final design due to costs and the bus operators' preference for above-ground bus facilities. Until early 2016, buses arrived at and departed from Queen Street in front of the station building, but that portion of Queen Street is currently closed to vehicular traffic while trench works for the City Rail Link take place.|$|E
