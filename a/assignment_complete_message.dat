25|$|Drawbacks of block {{interleaver}} : As it {{is clear}} from the figure, the columns are read sequentially, the receiver can interpret single row only after it receives <b>complete</b> <b>message</b> and not before that. Also, the receiver requires a considerable amount of memory in order to store the received symbols and has to store the <b>complete</b> <b>message.</b> Thus, these factors give rise to two drawbacks, one is the latency and other is the storage (fairly large amount of memory). These drawbacks can be avoided by using the convolutional interleaver described below.|$|R
30|$|The {{next phase}} of the LBAOMDV {{protocol}} ensures actual data transfer over the qualified multiple channels. A <b>complete</b> <b>message</b> is divided into fixed-sized chunks which are transferred over the multiple qualified paths. A successful data transfer of a <b>complete</b> <b>message</b> {{will result in the}} end of the LBAOMDV protocol process. An unsuccessful data transfer due to path breakdown will require that the failed data chunk be retransferred. This retransfer of data will be treated as a new message and will be distributed across all the K− 1 available channels.|$|R

50|$|In the {{simplest}} implementation the verifier sends a random message {{as large as}} the device's memory to the device, which is expected to store it. After the device has received the <b>complete</b> <b>message,</b> it is required to send it back. Security of this approach is obvious, but it includes transfer of a huge amount of data (twice the size of the device's memory).|$|R

50|$|Each GPS {{satellite}} continuously broadcasts a navigation {{message on}} L1 (C/A and P/Y) and L2 (P/Y) frequencies {{at a rate}} of 50 bits per second (see bitrate). Each <b>complete</b> <b>message</b> takes 750 seconds (12 1/2 minutes) to <b>complete.</b> The <b>message</b> structure has a basic format of a 1500-bit-long frame made up of five subframes, each subframe being 300 bits (6 seconds) long. Subframes 4 and 5 are subcommutated 25 times each, so that a <b>complete</b> data <b>message</b> requires the transmission of 25 full frames. Each subframe consists of ten words, each 30 bits long. Thus, with 300 bits in a subframe times 5 subframes in a frame times 25 frames in a message, each message is 37,500 bits long. At a transmission rate of 50-bit/s, this gives 750 seconds to transmit an entire almanac message (GPS). Each 30-second frame begins precisely on the minute or half-minute as indicated by the atomic clock on each satellite.|$|R
