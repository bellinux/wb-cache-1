5|$|Neptune's second known {{satellite}} (by {{order of}} discovery), the irregular moon Nereid, {{has one of}} the most eccentric orbits of any satellite in the Solar System. The eccentricity of 0.7512 gives it an <b>apoapsis</b> that is seven times its periapsis distance from Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{analysis of}} imaging, mass spectrometry, and magnetospheric data {{suggests that the}} observed south polar plume emanates from pressurized subsurface chambers, similar to Earth's geysers,. The mechanism that drives and sustains the eruptions {{is thought to be}} tidal heating. The intensity of the eruption of the south polar jets varies significantly {{as a function of the}} position of Enceladus in its orbit. The plumes are about four times brighter when Enceladus is at <b>apoapsis</b> (the point in its orbit most distant from Saturn) than when it is at periapsis. This is consistent with geophysical calculations which predict the south polar fissures are under compression near periapsis, pushing them shut, and under tension near <b>apoapsis,</b> pulling them open.|$|E
5|$|Two {{values are}} {{provided}} for {{the dimensions of the}} initial orbit. For telescopes in Earth orbit, the min and max altitude are given in kilometers. For telescopes in solar orbit, the minimum distance (periapsis) and the maximum distance (<b>apoapsis)</b> between the telescope and the center of mass of the sun are given in astronomical units (AU).|$|E
5|$|Ganymede {{participates in}} orbital {{resonances}} with Europa and Io: for every orbit of Ganymede, Europa orbits twice and Io orbits four times. The superior conjunction between Io and Europa always occurs when Io is at periapsis and Europa at <b>apoapsis.</b> The superior conjunction between Europa and Ganymede occurs when Europa is at periapsis. The longitudes of the Io–Europa and Europa–Ganymede conjunctions {{change with the}} same rate, making triple conjunctions impossible. Such a complicated resonance is called the Laplace resonance.|$|E
5|$|The Voyager 2 {{spacecraft}} {{observed a}} strange {{signal from the}} ε ring during the radio occultation experiment. The signal looked like a strong enhancement of the forward-scattering at the wavelength 3.6cm near ring’s <b>apoapsis.</b> Such strong scattering requires {{the existence of a}} coherent structure. That the ε ring does have such a fine structure has been confirmed by many occultation observations. The ε ring seems to consist of a number of narrow and optically dense ringlets, some of which may have incomplete arcs.|$|E
5|$|The {{geometric}} {{thickness of}} the ε ring is not precisely known, although the ring is certainly very thin—by some estimates as thin as 150m. Despite such infinitesimal thickness, it consists of several layers of particles. The ε ring is a rather crowded place with a filling factor near the <b>apoapsis</b> estimated by different sources at from 0.008 to 0.06. The mean size of the ring particles is 0.2–20.0m, and the mean separation is around 4.5 times their radius. The ring is almost devoid of dust, possibly due to the aerodynamic drag from Uranus's extended atmospheric corona. Due to its razor-thin nature the ε ring is invisible when viewed edge-on. This happened in 2007 when a ring plane-crossing was observed.|$|E
5|$|After the ε ring, the α and β {{rings are}} the {{brightest}} of Uranus's rings. Like the ε ring, they exhibit regular variations in brightness and width. They are brightest and widest 30° from the <b>apoapsis</b> and dimmest and narrowest 30° from the periapsis. The α and β rings have sizable orbital eccentricity and non-negligible inclination. The widths of these rings are 4.8–10km and 6.1–11.4km, respectively. The equivalent optical depths are 3.29km and 2.14km, resulting in normal optical depths of 0.3–0.7 and 0.2–0.35, respectively. During a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 the rings disappeared, {{which means they}} are geometrically thin like the ε ring and devoid of dust. However, the same event revealed a thick and optically thin dust band just outside the β ring, which was also observed earlier by Voyager 2. The masses of the α and β rings {{are estimated to be}} about 5kg (each)—half the mass of the ε ring.|$|E
25|$|After 100 {{days the}} <b>apoapsis</b> was lowered to 10,107km and {{periapsis}} raised to 298km {{to give an}} orbital period of 6.7 hours.|$|E
25|$|For any orbits {{around a}} center of mass, there are the terms {{periapsis}} and <b>apoapsis</b> (or apapsis). Pericenter and apocenter are equivalent alternatives.|$|E
25|$|From {{the surface}} of Quaoar and {{at a point where}} Weywot is at zenith it would have an angular {{diameter}} of 15.9 arcminutes at <b>apoapsis</b> and 21.4 arcminutes at periapsis, in comparison the Moon's size varies between 29.4 and 33.5 arcminutes. Its apparent magnitude at full phase would be about -3, comparable to Jupiter at maximum brightness.|$|E
25|$|Other orbital {{parameters}} can be computed from the Keplerian {{elements such as}} the period, <b>apoapsis,</b> and periapsis. (When orbiting the Earth, the last two terms are known as the apogee and perigee.) It is common to specify the period instead of the semi-major axis in Keplerian element sets, as each can be computed from the other provided the standard gravitational parameter, , is given for the central body.|$|E
25|$|First {{evaluation}} of the orbital insertion showed that the orbiter had reached its first milestone at Mars. The orbit was later adjusted by four more main engine firings to the desired 259km × 11,560km near-polar (86 degree inclination) orbit with a period of 7.5 hours. Near periapsis the top deck is pointed down towards the Martian surface and near <b>apoapsis</b> the high gain antenna will be pointed towards Earth for uplink and downlink.|$|E
25|$|A small radial impulse {{given to}} a body in orbit changes the eccentricity, but not the orbital period (to first order). A {{prograde}} or retrograde impulse (i.e. an impulse applied along the orbital motion) changes both the eccentricity and the orbital period. Notably, a prograde impulse at periapsis raises the altitude at <b>apoapsis,</b> and vice versa, and a retrograde impulse does the opposite. A transverse impulse (out of the orbital plane) causes rotation of the orbital plane without changing the period or eccentricity. In all instances, a closed orbit will still intersect the perturbation point.|$|E
25|$|The Mars Orbiter Mission {{team won}} US-based National Space Society's 2015 Space Pioneer Award {{in the science}} and {{engineering}} category. NSS said the award was given as the Indian agency successfully executed a Mars mission in its first attempt; and the spacecraft is in an elliptical orbit with a high <b>apoapsis</b> where, with its high resolution camera, it is taking full-disk colour imagery of Mars. Very few full disk images have ever been taken in the past, mostly on approach to the planet, as most imaging is done looking straight down in mapping mode. These images will aid planetary scientists.|$|E
25|$|Recent closeup {{images from}} the Cassini probe show that the F Ring {{consists}} of one core ring and a spiral strand around it. They also show that when Prometheus encounters the ring at its <b>apoapsis,</b> its gravitational attraction creates kinks and knots in the F Ring as the moon 'steals' material from it, leaving a dark channel in the inner part of the ring (see video link and additional F Ring images in gallery). Since Prometheus orbits Saturn more rapidly than the material in the F ring, each new channel is carved about 3.2 degrees {{in front of the}} previous one.|$|E
25|$|HD 80606, a sun-like star in {{a binary}} system, orbits a common center of gravity with its partner, HD 80607; the two are {{separated}} by 1,200 AU on average. Research conducted in 2003 indicates that its sole planet, HD 80606 b is a future hot Jupiter, modeled to have evolved in a perpendicular orbit around 5 AU from its sun. The 4-Jupiter mass planet is projected to eventually move into a circular, more aligned orbit via the Kozai mechanism. However, it is currently on an incredibly eccentric orbit that ranges from approximately one astronomical unit at its <b>apoapsis</b> and six stellar radii at periapsis.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of planets {{orbiting}} a star, {{the mass of the}} star and all its satellites are calculated to be at a single point called the barycenter. The paths of all the star's satellites are elliptical orbits about that barycenter. Each satellite in that system will have its own elliptical orbit with the barycenter at one focal point of that ellipse. At any point along its orbit, any satellite will have a certain value of kinetic and potential energy with respect to the barycenter, and that energy is a constant value at every point along its orbit. As a result, as a planet approaches periapsis, the planet will increase in speed as its potential energy decreases; as a planet approaches <b>apoapsis,</b> its velocity will decrease as its potential energy increases.|$|E
25|$|Through {{repeated}} computerized test {{simulations of}} trajectories through the Neptunian system conducted in advance, flight controllers determined {{the best way}} to route Voyager 2 through the Neptune-Triton system. Since the plane of the orbit of Triton is tilted significantly with respect to the plane of the ecliptic, through mid-course corrections, Voyager 2 was directed into a path about three thousand miles above the north pole of Neptune. At that time, Triton was behind and below (south of) Neptune (at an angle of about 25 degrees below the ecliptic), close to the <b>apoapsis</b> of its elliptical orbit. The gravitational pull of Neptune bent the trajectory of Voyager 2 down in the direction of Triton. In less than 24 hours, Voyager 2 traversed the distance between Neptune and Triton, and then observed Triton's northern hemisphere as it passed over its north pole.|$|E
25|$|Fortunately, Galileo possessed an {{additional}} low-gain antenna that {{was capable of}} transmitting information back to Earth, although since it transmitted a signal isotropically, the low-gain antenna's bandwidth was significantly less than what the high-gain antenna's would have been; the high-gain antenna was to have transmitted at 134kilobits per second, whereas the low-gain antenna was only intended to transmit at about 8 to 16bits per second. Galileo low-gain antenna transmitted with a power of about 15 to 20watts, which, {{by the time it}} reached Earth and had been collected by one of the large aperture (70 m) NASA Deep Space Network antennas, had a total power of about −170dBm or 10zeptowatts (watts). Through the implementation of sophisticated technologies, the arraying of several Deep Space Network antennas and sensitivity upgrades to the receivers used to listen to Galileo signal, data throughput was increased to a maximum of 160bits per second. By further using data compression, the effective data rate could be raised to 1,000bits per second. The data collected on Jupiter and its moons was stored in the spacecraft's onboard tape recorder, and transmitted back to Earth during the long <b>apoapsis</b> portion of the probe's orbit using the low-gain antenna. At the same time, measurements were made of Jupiter's magnetosphere and transmitted back to Earth. The reduction in available bandwidth reduced the total amount of data transmitted throughout the mission, although 70% of Galileo science goals could still be met.|$|E
500|$|Orbital {{studies of}} the new comet soon {{revealed}} that it was orbiting Jupiter rather than the Sun, unlike all other comets known at the time. Its orbit around Jupiter was very loosely bound, with {{a period of about}} 2 years and an <b>apoapsis</b> (the point in the orbit farthest from the planet) of [...] Its orbit around the planet was highly eccentric (e = 0.9986).|$|E
500|$|Completion of {{the orbital}} {{insertion}} placed the orbiter {{in a highly}} elliptical polar orbit with a period of approximately 35.5 hours. Shortly after insertion, the periapsis – {{the point in the}} orbit closest to Mars – was [...] from the surface ( [...] from the planet's center). The <b>apoapsis</b> – the point in the orbit farthest from Mars – was [...] from the surface ( [...] from the planet's center).|$|E
500|$|The ε ring is the {{brightest}} and densest {{part of the}} Uranian ring system, and is responsible for {{about two-thirds of the}} light reflected by the rings. [...] While it is the most eccentric of the Uranian rings, it has negligible orbital inclination. The ring's eccentricity causes its brightness to vary over the course of its orbit. The radially integrated brightness of the ε ring is highest near <b>apoapsis</b> and lowest near periapsis. The maximum/minimum brightness ratio is about 2.5–3.0. These variations are connected with the variations of the ring width, which is 19.7km at the periapsis and 96.4km at the <b>apoapsis.</b> As the ring becomes wider, the amount of shadowing between particles decreases and more of them come into view, leading to higher integrated brightness. The width variations were measured directly from Voyager 2 images, as the ε ring was one of only two rings resolved by Voyager’s cameras. Such behavior indicates that the ring is not optically thin. Indeed, occultation observations conducted from the ground and the spacecraft showed that its normal optical depth varies between 0.5 and 2.5, being highest near the periapsis. The equivalent depth of the ε ring is around 47km and is invariant around the orbit.|$|E
500|$|The JAXA probe Akatsuki, {{launched}} in May 2010, {{was intended to}} study the planet {{for a period of}} two years, including the structure and activity of the atmosphere, but it failed to enter Venus orbit in December 2010. A second attempt to achieve orbit succeeded 7 December 2015. One of its five cameras known as the [...] "IR2" [...] will be able to measure the atmosphere of the planet underneath its thick clouds, in addition to its movement and distribution of trace components. With a highly eccentric orbit (periapsis altitude of 400km and <b>apoapsis</b> of 310,000km), {{it will be able to}} take close-up photographs of the planet, and should also confirm the presence of both active volcanoes as well as lightning.|$|E
500|$|On March 30, 2006, MRO {{began the}} process of aerobraking, a three-step {{procedure}} that cuts in half the fuel needed to achieve a lower, more circular orbit with a shorter period. First, during its first five orbits of the planet (one Earth week), MRO used its thrusters to drop the periapsis of its orbit into aerobraking altitude. This altitude depends on {{the thickness of the}} atmosphere because Martian atmospheric density changes with its seasons. Second, while using its thrusters to make minor corrections to its periapsis altitude, MRO maintained aerobraking altitude for 445 planetary orbits (about five Earth months) to reduce the <b>apoapsis</b> of the orbit to [...] This was done in such a way so as to not heat the spacecraft too much, but also dip enough into the atmosphere to slow the spacecraft down. After the process was complete, MRO used its thrusters to move its periapsis out of the edge of the Martian atmosphere on August 30, 2006.|$|E
500|$|The tidal heating of Io is {{dependent}} on its distance from Jupiter, its orbital eccentricity, the composition of its interior, and its physical state. Its Laplace orbital resonance with Europa and Ganymede maintains Io's eccentricity and prevents tidal dissipation within Io from circularizing its orbit. The eccentricity leads to vertical differences in Io's tidal bulge {{of as much as}} [...] as Jupiter's gravitational pull varies between the periapsis and <b>apoapsis</b> points in Io's orbit. This varying tidal pull also produces friction in Io's interior, enough to cause significant tidal heating and melting. Unlike Earth, where most of its internal heat is released by conduction through the crust, on Io internal heat is released via volcanic activity and generates the satellite's high heat flow (global total: 0.6–1.6 W). Models of its orbit suggest that the amount of tidal heating within Io changes with time, and that the current heat flow is not representative of the long-term average. The observed release of heat from Io's interior is greater than estimates for the amount presently generated from tidal heating, suggesting that Io is cooling after a period of greater flexing.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Earth and the Moon, Io's {{main source}} of {{internal}} heat comes from tidal dissipation rather than radioactive isotope decay, the result of Io's orbital resonance with Europa and Ganymede. Such heating is dependent on Io's distance from Jupiter, its orbital eccentricity, the composition of its interior, and its physical state. Its Laplace resonance with Europa and Ganymede maintains Io's eccentricity and prevents tidal dissipation within Io from circularizing its orbit. The resonant orbit also helps to maintain Io's distance from Jupiter; otherwise tides raised on Jupiter would cause Io to slowly spiral outward from its parent planet. The vertical differences in Io's tidal bulge, between the times Io is at periapsis and <b>apoapsis</b> in its orbit, could {{be as much as}} [...] The friction or tidal dissipation produced in Io's interior due to this varying tidal pull, which, without the resonant orbit, would have gone into circularizing Io's orbit instead, creates significant tidal heating within Io's interior, melting a significant amount of Io's mantle and core. The amount of energy produced is up to 200 times greater than that produced solely from radioactive decay. This heat is released in the form of volcanic activity, generating its observed high heat flow (global total: 0.6 to 1.6×1014W). Models of its orbit suggest that the amount of tidal heating within Io changes with time; however, the current amount of tidal dissipation is consistent with the observed heat flow. Models of tidal heating and convection have not found consistent planetary viscosity profiles that simultaneously match tidal energy dissipation and mantle convection of heat to the surface.|$|E

The point where the satellite is farthest from Earth is called the apogee, <b>apoapsis,</b> or sometimes apifocus or apocentron. A line drawn from periapsis to <b>apoapsis</b> is the line-of-apsides. This is the major axis of the ellipse, the line through its longest part.|$|E

For circular orbits, the semimajor axis is {{the distance between the}} centers of the bodies, not the distance of the bodies from the center of mass. For a parabolic orbit, this is infinite. For a hyperbolic orbit, if you graph the two-branched hyperbola on the Cartesian plane, is half the distance between periapsis and the opposing vertex and is usually treated as negative for orbital energy purposes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{orbit of}} a planet around the Sun is an ellipse, with the Sun {{in one of the}} focal points of that ellipse. [...] The planet's orbit lies in a plane, called the orbital plane. The point on the orbit closest to the {{attracting}} body is the periapsis. The point farthest from the attracting body is called the <b>apoapsis.</b> There are also specific terms for orbits about particular bodies; things orbiting the Sun have a perihelion and aphelion, things orbiting the Earth have a perigee and apogee, and things orbiting the Moon have a perilune and apolune (or periselene and aposelene respectively). An orbit around any star, not just the Sun, has a periastron and an apastron.|$|E
2500|$|A {{straight}} line connecting the periapsis and <b>apoapsis</b> {{is the line}} of apsides. This is the major axis of the ellipse, its greatest diameter.

However, in the case of the Moon, the center of mass of the Earth–Moon system, or Earth–Moon barycenter, as the common focus of both the Moon's and Earth's orbits about each other, is about 75% of the way from Earth's center to its surface.|$|E
