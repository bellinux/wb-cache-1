Author Ben Schott outlined a throwing method as a winning strategy in his third book, Schott’s Sporting, Gaming and Idling Miscellany, but his method was dismissed as cheating by competition organisers. In any event, the turbulence around the bridge supports make the path of the stick very difficult to predict and may vary according to the season.|$|E

25|$|During that January though, {{the food}} {{ran out and}} none {{was left in the}} {{district}} — already affected by famine, the population took what little there was with them when they fled. The rainy season brought malaria and dysentery, all four surviving officers fell sick, and floods cut Bunkeya off from the game-rich plains to the north where they might have hunted. Moloney recovered first and took charge of the expedition's task of building a more permanent fort <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> food. 76 of the expedition's askaris and porters died that month of dysentery and starvation.

500|$|In 2000, keyboardist Christopher Dudley joined Underoath, and the five-song, forty-minute long record, Cries of the Past was released, quickly selling 3,000 copies. In 2001, Takehold Records {{was bought}} out by Seattle's Tooth & Nail Records and Underoath was {{subsequently}} signed to the label's subsidiary, Solid State Records. In January 2002, bassist Grant Brandell joined Underoath. The band then {{began working on}} their Solid State debut, The Changing of Times, with Cries of the Past producer James Paul Wisner. The album was released on February 26, 2002, and produced one single titled [...] "When the Sun Sleeps". Dallas Taylor explained that the lyrics on The Changing of Times were about [...] "people playing with other people's emotions {{and how it can}} leave you bitter" [...] and [...] "struggling through life's hardships <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> God in all of it." [...] The band was criticized by critics and long-time fans for the album's style because it had changed from the sound of their previous releases. However, The Changing of Times went on to outsell both of their earlier releases combined.|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{reception}} {{ranged from}} positive to mixed.

I just enjoyed the hour and felt it had just the right mixture of creepiness and character development (plus, the Observer was awesome. If only they'd called him the Watcher, but let's not quibble)." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger found [...] "The Arrival" [...] a noticeable improvement over previous episodes. [...] "...After being more than prepared to give [...] "Fringe That's It For Me! status going into the episode, I enjoyed the strangeness of it—The Observer's hairlessness and diet, Capt. Patterson from [...] "Generation Kill" [...] toting around a futuristic-looking ray gun and a retro-looking mind-reading machine, Walter casually injecting whatsername with a sedative—that I think I'll be sticking around for a bit...

500|$|Loeb said in July 2017 that Marvel Television had {{no plans}} for series to {{crossover}} across networks. Specifically for the similarly themed Cloak & Dagger, New Warriors, and Runaways, which all deal with young heroes, Loeb noted [...] "You'll see things that comment on each other; we try to touch base wherever we can... {{things that are happening}} in L.A. [...] are not exactly going to be affecting what's happening in New Orleans ... It's being aware of it <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a way for it to be able to discuss {{in a way that makes}} sense." [...] He added in October that scheduling of each series factors into why crossovers between them are more difficult to pull off, and that network [...] "feelings" [...] need to be considered. He also spoke on why the television series do not show Avengers Tower as it appears in the films when they depict New York City, and stated that Marvel Television wanted to be [...] "less specific" [...] about the television characters' relationships to the tower because that [...] "helps the audience understand that this could be on any street corner" [...] and that the characters could be in an area of the city where you would not be able to see the tower, even though it exists.|$|E
500|$|In March 2014, Dinklage {{confirmed}} that Season 4 would [...] "stick fairly closely" [...] to Tyrion's plot line in A Storm of Swords, adding that [...] "those reversals of fortune really send [...] down the rabbit hole." [...] He {{notes that the}} character changes in Season 4, and [...] "really ends up {{in a different place}} than he thought he was going to. It's fueled a bit by anger towards his family, <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> his place in the world. You see that some people rely on drunk, funny Tyrion. I think funny and drunk lasts only so long. He sobers up in many ways. And love is in his life , and that causes a tremendous amount of damage – because he's vulnerable and he doesn't like to be vulnerable. He's completely stripped of his defense mechanisms." [...] Of Tyrion's relationship with his brother Jaime, Dinklage said, [...] "If you're raised together, you have an unspoken dialogue many times, and it's very easy, especially between Jaime and Tyrion. They have a real friendship, a good brotherhood. They look after each other." [...] As in the novels, Tyrion is (unfairly) found guilty of Joffrey's murder and condemned to death; the HBO series does not use the reveal that his first wife was not really a prostitute to motivate Tyrion to kill his father, and he does not lie to Jaime that he is guilty of killing Joffrey.|$|E

I wouldn't be who I am today without Michael Jackson." [...] During the television special '', Usher was able to dance with Michael while performing [...] "You Rock My World". Prince being another main influence, Usher said [...] "every album I’d always do like one song that is very Prince-influenced, because he's a great influence on me musically, especially just kind of being expansive and creating music that represents many different genres." [...] In Time magazine's [...] "100 Most Influential People" [...] issue, he explained [...] "I was interested in music <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a model. It was Michael, or it was Prince. He had an attitude, a rawness that Michael didn't have. He was not urban, but he was our version of what cool could be." [...] In addition, he has spoken of Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder as great musicians and philanthropists stating that [...] "they figured out what they were as they were going, by inspiration as well...allowing their music to speak {{to where they were}} and what they had to say". Other musical influences include Luther Vandross, Janet Jackson, Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, Al Green, and Boyz II Men.|$|E
500|$|A Kryptonian sent by {{his parents}} to Earth as an infant to escape the {{destruction}} of his homeworld, Krypton, and raised in Smallville, Kansas, under mental guidance of farmers Martha and Jonathan Kent until he is inspired by the holographic message from his late father to become Earth's greatest protector (Superman is depicted as being 33 years old, {{at least from the}} moment he is found, in the present timeline of the film). Cavill is the first British and non-American actor to play the character. He was previously cast in , which was ultimately shelved, and was considered for the role in the 2006 film Superman Returns, but lost to Brandon Routh. Cavill stated, [...] "There's a very real story behind the Superman character." [...] He explained that everyone's goal has been to explore the difficulties his character faces as a result of having multiple identities – including his birth name, Kal-El, and his alter ego, Clark Kent. Cavill also stated that, [...] "He's alone and there's no one like him," [...] referring to Superman's vulnerabilities. [...] "That must be incredibly scary and lonely, not to know who you are or what you are, <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out what makes sense. Where's your baseline? What do you draw from? Where do you draw a limit with the power you have? In itself, that's an incredible weakness." [...] In an interview with Total Film magazine, Cavill stated he had been consuming nearly 5,000 calories a day, training for over two hours daily and plowing protein to pack on the muscle mass. Joe Manganiello was considered for the role but could not work out an audition date for the casting director due to scheduling obligations with True Blood. Cooper Timberline was cast as the 9-year-old Clark Kent, and Dylan Sprayberry was cast as the 13-year-old Clark Kent.|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, Spears' manager Larry Rudolph told The Sun that a {{video for}} [...] "Radar" [...] {{directed}} by Spears {{was to be}} shot in Chelsea, London. The concept would have Spears and her friends chasing a man in different clubs. However, this was scrapped along with the single’s release. The music video for [...] "Radar" [...] from Circus was filmed on May 27 and 28, 2009, at the Bacara Resort & Spa located in Santa Barbara, California. It was directed by Dave Meyers, who previously worked with Spears on her music videos for [...] "Lucky", [...] "Boys" [...] and [...] "Outrageous" [...] {{as well as the}} Curious commercials. Meyers claimed the video pays tribute to the music video of Madonna's 1994 single [...] "Take a Bow". He added, [...] " [...] {{looking for a way to}} take her into a contemporary, classy environment. I felt empowered by referencing Madonna's video. Britney hasn't done anything like that". He had a very clear idea of how he wanted the story line to work: [...] "There is a narrative going on, a romantic triangle on a weekend at this polo mansion," [...] he said. [...] "A soap-opera romance." [...] Meyers commented that working with Spears again was [...] "a great celebration of trusting one another", explaining that both wanted [...] "to do something fresh and new, seeking out an actual different technique and stylistic choices <b>and</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a form to celebrate them in." [...] Since the song was not the first single from Circus, Meyers chose to experiment and not have dancing scenes, saying that [...] "the videos are a chance for her to vocalize a sense of herself. The media tends to attack her, so I thought, 'Let's show the classy side of Britney and focus on a classy experience, very European-inspired'. And she's at the point in her career where I think this would be a nice step." [...] After the video was finished, Meyers said he was happy with the lack of dancing scenes, because the cuts and dissolves kept the pace of the song.|$|E
