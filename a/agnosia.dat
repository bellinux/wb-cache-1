5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Lillard began writing a column on {{sports in the}} Independent News. Later in his life, he moved to Astoria, Queens, working at an {{appliance}} store and for Vinn Sporting Goods. Lillard had a stroke on September 18, 1978, and was afflicted with <b>agnosia</b> as a result; he died in New York City's Bellevue Hospital Center.|$|E
5|$|Cognition {{can also}} be {{affected}} in Wilson's disease. This comes in two, not mutually exclusive, categories: frontal lobe disorder (may present as impulsivity, impaired judgement, promiscuity, apathy and executive dysfunction with poor planning and decision making) and subcortical dementia (may present as slow thinking, memory loss and executive dysfunction, without signs of aphasia, apraxia or <b>agnosia).</b> It is suggested that these cognitive involvements are related and closely linked to psychiatric manifestations of the disease.|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} AD, the {{increasing}} impairment {{of learning and}} memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (<b>agnosia),</b> or execution of movements (apraxia) are more prominent than memory problems. AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (episodic memory), facts learned (semantic memory), and implicit memory (the memory of the body {{on how to do}} things, such as using a fork to eat or how to drink from a glass) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.|$|E
25|$|Visual <b>agnosia</b> {{is a broad}} {{category}} that refers to a deficiency {{in the ability to}} recognize visual objects. Visual <b>agnosia</b> can be further subdivided into two different subtypes: apperceptive visual <b>agnosia</b> and associative visual <b>agnosia.</b>|$|E
25|$|An <b>agnosia</b> {{that affects}} hearing, {{auditory}} sound <b>agnosia,</b> is broken into subdivisions based on level of processing impaired, and a semantic-associative form is investigated within the auditory agnosias.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with apperceptive visual <b>agnosia</b> {{display the}} ability to see {{contours}} and outlines when shown an object, but they experience difficulty if asked to categorize objects. Apperceptive visual <b>agnosia</b> is associated with damage to one hemisphere, specifically damage to the posterior sections of the right hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|For all {{practical}} purposes, {{there is no}} direct cure. Patients may improve if information is presented in other modalities than the damaged one. Different types of therapies can help to reverse the effects of <b>agnosia.</b> In some cases, occupational therapy or speech therapy can improve <b>agnosia,</b> depending on its cause.|$|E
25|$|The {{consistency}} {{of this model}} to <b>agnosia</b> is shown by evidence that bilateral lesions to the superior temporal sulcus produces 'pure word deafness' (Kussmaul, 1877), or as it's understood today—speech <b>agnosia.</b> Patients with pure word deafness demonstrate the inability to recognize and process speech sounds with normal auditory processing for non-speech sounds {{below the level of}} the cortex.|$|E
25|$|Patients who {{experience}} dramatic recovery from blindness experience significant to total <b>agnosia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dr. Michael Fitzgerald {{disputes}} {{the claim of}} schizophrenia, saying that Wain more likely had Asperger's syndrome (AS). Of particular note, Fitzgerald indicates that while Wain's art took on a more abstract nature as he grew older, his technique and skill as a painter did not diminish, {{as one would expect}} from a person with schizophrenia. Moreover, elements of visual <b>agnosia</b> are demonstrated in his painting. If Wain had visual <b>agnosia,</b> it might have manifested itself merely as an extreme attention to detail.|$|E
25|$|There are {{clinical}} trials {{being done to}} further research for treatments. At the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) they support research for rare diseases like <b>agnosia.</b> Some organizations that are recruiting for trials are using clincaltrials.gov and give status updates on the trials.|$|E
25|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD), {{also known}} simply as Alzheimer's, is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease characterized by progressive cognitive deterioration together with declining {{activities of daily living}} and neuropsychiatric symptoms or behavioral changes. The most striking early symptom is loss of short-term memory (amnesia), which usually manifests as minor forgetfulness that becomes steadily more pronounced with illness progression, with relative preservation of older memories. As the disorder progresses, cognitive (intellectual) impairment extends to the domains of language (aphasia), skilled movements (apraxia), and recognition (<b>agnosia),</b> and functions such as decision-making and planning become impaired.|$|E
25|$|Freud {{began his}} study of {{medicine}} at the University of Vienna in 1873. He took almost nine years to complete his studies, due to his interest in neurophysiological research, specifically investigation of the sexual anatomy of eels and the physiology of the fish nervous system, and because of his interest in studying philosophy with Franz Brentano. He entered private practice in neurology for financial reasons, receiving his M.D. degree in 1881 at the age of 25. Amongst his principal concerns in the 1880s was the anatomy of the brain, specifically the medulla oblongata. He intervened in the important debates about aphasia with his monograph of 1891, Zur Auffassung der Aphasien, in which he coined the term <b>agnosia</b> and counselled against a too locationist view of the explanation of neurological deficits. Like his contemporary Eugen Bleuler, he emphasized brain function rather than brain structure.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Agnosia</b> {{can result}} from strokes, dementia, or other {{neurological}} disorders. It may also be trauma-induced by a head injury, brain infection, or hereditary. [...] Additionally, some forms of <b>agnosia</b> {{may be the result}} of developmental disorders. Damage causing <b>agnosia</b> usually occurs in either the occipital or parietal lobes of the brain. [...] Although one modality may be affected, cognitive abilities in other areas are preserved.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} assess an {{individual}} for <b>agnosia,</b> it must be verified that the individual is not suffering from a loss of sensation, and that both their language abilities and intelligence are intact. [...] In order for an individual to be diagnosed with <b>agnosia,</b> they must only be experiencing a sensory deficit in a single modality. [...] To make a diagnosis, the distinction between apperceptive and associative <b>agnosia</b> must be made. [...] This distinction {{can be made by}} having the individual complete copying and matching tasks. [...] If the individual is suffering from a form of apperceptive <b>agnosia</b> {{they will not be able}} to match two stimuli that are identical in appearance. [...] In contrast, if an individual is suffering from a form of associative <b>agnosia,</b> they will not be able to match different examples of a stimulus. [...] For example, an individual who has been diagnosed with associative <b>agnosia</b> in the visual modality would not be able to match pictures of a laptop that is open with a laptop that is closed.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, {{individuals}} with associative visual <b>agnosia</b> experience difficulty {{when asked to}} name objects. Associative <b>agnosia</b> is associated with damage to both {{the right and left}} hemispheres at the occipitotemporal border. [...] A specific form of associative visual <b>agnosia</b> is known as prosopagnosia. [...] Prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize faces. [...] For example, these individuals have difficulty recognizing friends, family and coworkers. However, {{individuals with}} prosopagnosia can recognize all other types of visual stimuli.|$|E
2500|$|Speech <b>agnosia,</b> or {{auditory}} verbal <b>agnosia,</b> {{refers to}} [...] "an inability to comprehend spoken words despite intact hearing, speech production and reading ability". Patients {{report that they}} do indeed hear sounds being produced, but that the sounds are fundamentally unrecognizable/untranslatable.|$|E
2500|$|Damage to {{the left}} {{hemisphere}} of the brain has been explicitly implicated in the associative form of visual <b>agnosia.</b> [...] Goldberg suggested that the associative visual form of <b>agnosia</b> results from damage to the ventral stream of the brain, the occipito-temporal stream, which {{plays a key role}} in object recognition as the so-called [...] "what" [...] region of the brain, as opposed to the [...] "where," [...] dorsal stream.|$|E
2500|$|Alternate cues may be {{particularly}} useful to an individual with environmental <b>agnosia</b> or prosopagnosia. [...] Alternate cues for an individual with environmental <b>agnosia</b> may include color cues or tactile markers to symbolize a new room or to remember an area by. [...] Prosopagnosics may use alternate cues such as a scar on an individual's face or crooked teeth in order to recognize the individual. Hair color and length can be helpful cues as well.|$|E
2500|$|Visual object <b>agnosia</b> (or {{semantic}} <b>agnosia)</b> is {{the most}} commonly encountered form of <b>agnosia.</b> [...] The clinical [...] "definition" [...] of the disorder is when an affected person is able to copy/draw things that they cannot recognize. Individuals afflicted with the associative type often cannot identify, describe or mimic functions of items, though perception is intact, since images of objects can be copied or drawn. [...] Individuals may retain semantic knowledge of the items, as exemplified during tasks where objects are presented through alternate modalities, through touch or verbal naming or description. [...] Some associative visual object agnostics retain the ability to categorize items by context or general category, though unable to name or describe them. [...] Diffuse hypoxic damage {{is the most}} common cause of visual object agnosias.|$|E
2500|$|After Wernicke, came Kussmaul in 1877 who {{attempted}} to explain why auditory verbal <b>agnosia,</b> also known as word deafness, occurs. [...] Contrary to Wernicke's explanations, Kussmaul believed auditory verbal <b>agnosia</b> {{was the result of}} major destruction to the first left temporal gyrus. [...] Kussmaul also posited about the origins of alexia (acquired dyslexia) also known as word blindness. [...] He believed that word blindness was the result of lesions to the left angular and supramarginal gyri.|$|E
2500|$|Agnosias are sensory {{modality}} specific, usually {{classified as}} visual, auditory, or tactile. [...] Associative visual <b>agnosia</b> {{refers to a}} subtype of visual <b>agnosia,</b> which was labeled by Lissauer (1890), as an inability to connect the visual percept (mental representation of something being perceived through the senses) with its related semantic information stored in memory, such as, its name, use, and description. This is distinguished from the visual apperceptive form of visual <b>agnosia,</b> apperceptive visual <b>agnosia,</b> which is an inability to produce a complete percept, and {{is associated with a}} failure in higher order perceptual processing where feature integration is impaired, though individual features can be distinguished. [...] In reality, patients often fall between both distinctions, with some degree of perceptual disturbances exhibited in most cases, and in some cases, patients may be labeled as integrative agnostics when they fit the criteria for both forms. [...] Associative visual agnosias are often category-specific, where recognition of particular categories of items are differentially impaired, which can affect selective classes of stimuli, larger generalized groups or multiple intersecting categories. [...] For example, deficits in recognizing stimuli can be as specific as familiar human faces or as diffuse as living things or non-living things.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Agnosia</b> is the {{inability}} to process sensory information. Often there is a loss of ability to recognize objects, persons, sounds, shapes, or smells while the specific sense is not defective {{nor is there any}} significant memory loss. It is usually associated with brain injury or neurological illness, particularly after damage to the occipitotemporal border, {{which is part of the}} ventral stream. [...] <b>Agnosia</b> only affects a single modality, such as vision or hearing. More recently, a top-down interruption is considered to cause the disturbance of handling perceptual information.|$|E
2500|$|Associative visual <b>agnosia</b> {{is a form}} {{of visual}} <b>agnosia.</b> It is an {{impairment}} in recognition or assigning meaning to a stimulus that is accurately perceived and not associated with a generalized deficit in intelligence, memory, language or attention. [...] The disorder appears to be very uncommon in a [...] "pure" [...] or uncomplicated form and is usually accompanied by other complex neuropsychological problems {{due to the nature of}} the etiology. [...] Afflicted individuals can accurately distinguish the object, as demonstrated by the ability to draw a picture of it or categorize accurately, yet they are unable to identify the object, its features or its functions.|$|E
2500|$|Any {{condition}} that causes a memory deficit will affect social functioning. [...] This will differ {{based on the}} nature and severity of the deficit. [...] For example, patients with Alzheimer's disease have difficulty during social interactions because of <b>agnosia,</b> and aphasia.|$|E
2500|$|Organizational {{strategies}} may be extremely helpful {{for an individual}} with visual <b>agnosia.</b> [...] For example, organizing clothes according to different hangers provides tactile cues for the individual, {{making it easier to}} identify certain forms of clothing as opposed to relying solely on visual cues.|$|E
2500|$|Heinrich Lissauer {{shared his}} ideas about <b>agnosia</b> after Wernicke and Kussmaul. In 1890, he theorized {{that there were}} two ways in which object {{recognition}} impairment could occur. [...] One way in which impairment could occur was if there was damage to early perceptual processing or if there was damage to the actual object representation. [...] If the actual object representation was damaged, this would not allow the object to be stored in visual memory, and therefore the individual {{would not be able to}} recognize the object. [...] During the time of Wernicke, Kussmaul and Lissauer there was little known about the cerebral cortex. [...] Today, with new neuroimaging techniques, we have been able to expand our knowledge on <b>agnosia</b> greatly.|$|E
2500|$|Using verbal {{descriptions}} may {{be helpful}} for individuals with certain types of <b>agnosia.</b> [...] Individuals such as prosopagnosics may find it useful {{to listen to a}} description of their friend or family member and recognize them based on this description more easily than through visual cues.|$|E
2500|$|Pure alexia ("alexia without dysgraphia" [...] or [...] "pure word blindness") is a category-specific <b>agnosia,</b> {{characterized}} by a distinct impairment in reading words, despite intact comprehension for verbally presented words, demonstrating retained semantic knowledge of words. [...] Perceptual abilities are also intact, as assessed by word-copying tasks.|$|E
2500|$|The term 'agnosia' [...] {{comes from}} the Ancient Greek ἀγνωσία (<b>agnosia),</b> [...] "ignorance", [...] "absence of knowledge". It was {{introduced}} by Sigmund Freud in 1891: [...] "For disturbances in the recognition of objects, which Finkelnburg classes as asymbolia, I should like to propose the term 'agnosia'." [...] Prior to Freud's introduction of the term, {{some of the first}} ideas about <b>agnosia</b> came from Carl Wernicke, who created theories about receptive aphasia in 1874. [...] He noted that individuals with receptive aphasia did not possess the ability to understand speech or repeat words. [...] He believed that receptive aphasia was due to lesions of the posterior third of the left superior temporal gyrus. [...] Due to these lesions, Wernicke believed that individuals with receptive aphasia had a limited deafness for certain sounds and frequencies in speech.|$|E
2500|$|A {{recognition}} {{disorder is}} {{not considered to be}} <b>agnosia</b> unless {{there is a lack of}} aphasia, dementia, or other generalized defect that affects any stage of the object recognition process, such as, deficiencies in intelligence, linguistic ability, memory, attention or sensory perception. [...] Therefore, individuals must be assessed for language ability, auditory comprehension, fluency, repetition, praxis, and reading and writing.|$|E
2500|$|Moreover, recent neuropsychological {{research}} has questioned {{the validity of}} the dissociation of the two streams that has provided the cornerstone of evidence for the model. [...] The dissociation between visual <b>agnosia</b> and optic ataxia has been challenged by several researchers as not as strong as originally portrayed; Hesse and colleagues demonstrated dorsal stream impairments in patient DF; Himmelbach and colleagues reassessed DF's abilities and applied more rigorous statistical analysis demonstrating that the dissociation wasn't as strong as first thought.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{clinical}} {{case that}} would a priori suggest a module for modularity in visual processing is visual <b>agnosia.</b> The well studied patient DF {{is unable to}} recognize or discriminate objects owing to damage {{in areas of the}} lateral occipital cortex although she can see scenes without problem – she can literally see the forest but not the trees. Neuroimaging of intact individuals reveals strong occipito-temporal activation during object presentation and greater activation still for object recognition. Of course, such activation could be due to other processes, such as visual attention. However, other evidence that shows a tight coupling of perceptual and physiological changes suggests activation in this area does underpin object recognition. Within these regions are more specialized areas for face or fine grained analysis, place perception and human body perception. Perhaps some of the strongest evidence for the modular nature of these processing systems is the double dissociation between object- and face (prosop-) <b>agnosia.</b> However, as with color and motion, early areas (see [...] for a comprehensive review) are implicated too, lending support {{to the idea of a}} multistage stream terminating in the inferotemporal cortex rather than an isolated module.|$|E
2500|$|Cerebral achromatopsia, {{also known}} as Color <b>agnosia,</b> is a category-specific {{semantic}} impairment pertaining to semantic color associations, such that individuals retain perceptual abilities for distinguishing color, demonstrated through color categorization or hue perception tasks; however knowledge of typical color-object relationships is defective. [...] Color agnostics are assessed on performance coloring {{in black and white}} images of common items or identifying abnormally colored objects within a set of images. [...] For example, a color agnostic may not identify a blue banana as being improperly colored.|$|E
2500|$|Achromatopsia (ACHM), {{also known}} as total color blindness, is a medical {{syndrome}} that exhibits symptoms relating to at least five conditions. The term may refer to acquired conditions such as cerebral achromatopsia, {{also known as}} color <b>agnosia,</b> but it typically refers to an autosomal recessive congenital color vision condition, the inability to perceive color and to achieve satisfactory visual acuity at high light levels (typically exterior daylight). The syndrome is also present in an incomplete form which is more properly defined as dyschromatopsia. [...] It is estimated to affect 1 in 40,000 live births worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|Prosopagnosia (or [...] "face blindness") is a category-specific visual object <b>agnosia,</b> specifically, {{impairment}} in visual recognition of familiar faces, such as close friends, family, husbands, wives, {{and sometimes even}} their own faces. [...] Individuals are often able to identify others through alternate characteristics, such as, voice, gait, [...] context or unique facial features. [...] This deficit is typically assessed through picture identification tasks of famous persons. This condition is associated with damage to the medial occipito-temporal gyri, including the fusiform and lingual gryi, as the suggested location of the brain's face recognition units.|$|E
