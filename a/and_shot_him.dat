Everything had gone as planned, he said, except that Nevill had put up a fight, and the friend had become angry <b>and</b> <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> seven times. The friend had allegedly told Sheila to lie down and shoot herself last, Bamber said. The friend then placed the Bible on her chest so she appeared to have killed herself in a religious frenzy.

5|$|Francisco Rafael was celebrating his 64th {{birthday}} {{along with}} his wife, children, and friends at Ocean House, a beachfront banquet hall owned by Hotel Marbella in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur on 18 October 2013.

At around 8:00p.m. that day, a black-colored SUV entered the private property and parked near {{the entrance of the}} ballroom. In the front seats of the car, according to eye-witness reports, were two men; in the back seat was a man dressed as a clown, who descended from the vehicle and headed towards the door that led to the kitchen. Once inside the ballroom, the clown identified Francisco Rafael {{at the center of the}} room and began to walk towards him. When the clown was about 1m (3.3ft) close, he pulled out a pistol from his costume <b>and</b> <b>shot</b> <b>him</b> point-blank in his head and then several times more as he fell to the ground, killing him on the scene. As the former drug lord lay dead near the entrance, the assassin ran through a rear exit while the attendees yelled, fell to the ground, and hid under the tables. Four more shots were heard outside the ballroom shortly after the attack; according to eyewitnesses, the clown had done this to scare off one of Francisco Rafael's sons, who was chasing him. The suspect then fled the crime scene in the black-colored SUV and headed towards the highway.|$|E
