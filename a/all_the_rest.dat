5|$|The {{illustrations}} are, {{according to}} the Preface, made from Wallace's own sketches, photographs, or specimens. Wallace thanks Walter and Henry Woodbury for some photographs of scenery and native people. He acknowledges William Wilson Saunders and Mr Pascoe for horned flies and very rare longhorn beetles: <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> were from his own enormous collection.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole point}} is that we are the song. The self is coming from a state of pure awareness, from the state of being. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> that comes about in the outward manifestation of the {{physical}} world (including all the fluctuations which end up as thoughts and actions) is just clutter. The true nature of each soul is pure consciousness. So the song is really about transcending and {{about the quality of the}} transcendent.|$|E

[...] "You ought to 'ave a billiard-room," [...] he said; [...] "I don't see that, but <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest's</b> <b>all</b> right. A lot of these 'ere officers 'ere 'ud be glad of a game of billiards."...|$|R

5|$|Subsequent names, {{rather than}} {{continuing}} the airy spirits theme (only Puck and Mab continued the trend), {{have focused on}} Herschel's source material. In 1949, the fifth moon, Miranda, was named by its discoverer Gerard Kuiper after a thoroughly mortal character in Shakespeare's The Tempest. The current IAU practice is to name moons after characters from Shakespeare's plays and The Rape of the Lock (although at present only Ariel, Umbriel, and Belinda have names drawn from the latter; <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> are from Shakespeare). At first, the outermost moons were all named after characters from one play, The Tempest; but with Margaret being named from Much Ado About Nothing that trend has ended.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1 {{found that}} about {{seven percent of}} the volume of Saturn's upper {{atmosphere}} is helium (compared with 11 percent of Jupiter's atmosphere), while almost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> is hydrogen. Since Saturn's internal helium abundance was expected to be the same as Jupiter's and the Sun's, the lower abundance of helium in the upper atmosphere may imply that the heavier helium may be slowly sinking through Saturn's hydrogen; that might explain the excess heat that Saturn radiates over energy it receives from the Sun. Winds blow at high speeds in Saturn. Near the equator, the Voyagers measured winds about 500m/s (1,100mph). The wind blows mostly in an easterly direction.|$|E
5|$|Where possible, the University of Chicago {{attempted}} to re-employ workers {{who had been}} transferred from the Metallurgical Laboratory to other projects once their work had ended. Replacing staff was nearly impossible, as Groves had ordered a staffing freeze. The only division to grow between November 1944 and March 1945 was the health division; <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> lost 20 {{percent or more of}} their staff. From a peak of 2,008 staff on 1 July 1944, the number of people working at the Metallurgical Laboratory fell to 1,444 on 1 July 1945.|$|E

5|$|On June 27, 1955, the Howard Beach station, {{along with}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the Rockaway Beach Branch {{stations}} {{south of the}} now defunct Ozone Park station, {{was taken out of}} service for eight months for restructuring and upgrading of the tracks, so that they could accommodate subway service. During the project, the Howard Beach station, along with the Broad Channel and Far Rockaway stations, was completely rebuilt utilizing a modern design, which included a new overhead passageway between the two platforms. The design was created by architect J. Harold Sandifer, a native of the Rockaways. Many of the parts for the station were prefabricated, speeding construction. On June 28, 1956, the station reopened as a subway station {{along with the rest of}} the line. The previous Long Island Rail Road station at this location was razed. Inauguration ceremonies were held at the station as well as at Euclid Avenue in Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|So, after Thor secures his goats at Egil's home, Thor and Týr go to Hymir's hall {{in search}} of a {{cauldron}} large enough to brew ale for them all. They arrive, and Týr sees his nine-hundred-headed grandmother and his gold-clad mother, the latter of which welcomes them with a horn. After Hymir—who is not happy to see Thor—comes in from the cold outdoors, Týr's mother helps them find a properly strong cauldron. Thor eats a big meal of two oxen (<b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> eat but one), and then goes to sleep. In the morning, he awakes and informs Hymir that he wants to go fishing the following evening, and that he will catch plenty of food, but that he needs bait. Hymir tells him to go get some bait from his pasture, which he expects should not be a problem for Thor. Thor goes out, finds Hymir's best ox, and rips its head off.|$|E

50|$|In a {{separate}} interview with GA Voice, Jenn Alva stated {{that there had}} to be a different way to approach immigration. “Our country is taking steps in the wrong direction…There’s got to be another way. We need to work to help them and see what brilliant compromise that we can establish.” The song “Hope” on Exits and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rests</b> was written about Arizona’s anti-immigration law.|$|R
5000|$|Berlioz began [...] "by {{writing a}} solo for viola, but one which {{involved}} the orchestra {{in such a}} way as not to reduce the effectiveness of the orchestral contribution." [...] When Paganini saw the sketch of the allegro movement, with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rests</b> in <b>the</b> viola part, he told Berlioz it would not do, and that he expected to be playing continuously. [...] They then parted, with Paganini disappointed.|$|R

25|$|Europeans began leaving Alexandria {{following}} the 1956 Suez Crisis {{that led to}} an outburst of Arab nationalism. The nationalization of property by Nasser, which reached its highest point in 1961, drove out nearly <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Shara McCallum's first collection, The Water Between Us, may be {{a typical}} first book of poetry that moves through the torments and glories of growing up, {{but it is not}} a typical collection. McCallum's poems are startling in their breadth of {{experience}} and language. From the beginning McCallum asks us to free our expectations with her apt epigraph, [...] "Only the magic and the dream are true. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest's</b> a lie" ...|$|R
50|$|Clea is a genus of {{freshwater}} snails with opercula, aquatic gastropod mollusks {{in the family}} Buccinidae, the true whelks, a large family, almost <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of which are marine.|$|R
25|$|Flicking is not {{universal}} amongst bassoonists; some American players, principally on the East Coast, use it sparingly, if at <b>all.</b> <b>The</b> <b>rest</b> use {{it virtually}} 100% of the time—it has become in essence {{part of the}} fingering.|$|E
25|$|The Elements {{began with}} {{definitions}} of terms, fundamental geometric principles (called axioms or postulates), and general quantitative principles (called common notions) from which <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of geometry could be logically deduced. Following are his five axioms, somewhat paraphrased {{to make the}} English easier to read.|$|E
25|$|Edwards's {{stint as}} the Lions coach was unsuccessful. He guided {{the team to}} a 4–6–1 record in 1941, and Mandel fired him after three {{straight}} losses to begin the 1942 season as the team's roster was depleted by players' service in World War II. Detroit went on to lose <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of its games after John Karcis was named his replacement.|$|E

That’s <b>all.</b> <b>The</b> <b>rest’s</b> mere newspaper gup. No doubt a wicked attempt to blow up the Observatory, they say. H’m. That’s hardly credible.” ...|$|R

25|$|The mine owners retaliated with a lockout of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the Leadville mines, {{so that by}} 22 June, {{the entire}} mining {{district}} was idled, {{with a total of}} about 2,250 mine workers out of work. The mine owners turned off the dewatering pumps and allowed the mines to start to fill with water, showing that they were prepared for a long strike.|$|E
25|$|Webb's {{shipyard}} suffered like <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest.</b> In 1867, {{the yard}} added one last distinction to its record with {{the completion of}} the twin sidewheel steamers Bristol and Providence—two {{of the largest and most}} lavish steamers of their era, which were to set new standards of comfort and luxury on Narragansett Bay. After this however, Webb was able to secure only two further contracts over the next two years.|$|E
