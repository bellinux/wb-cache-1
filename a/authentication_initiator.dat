Mobile networked computing is raising important information security and privacy issues. This paper {{is concerned with the}} design of authentication protocols for a mobile computing environment. The paper first analyses the <b>authentication</b> <b>initiator</b> protocols proposed by Beller,Chang and Yacobi (BCY) and the modifications considered by Carlsen and points out some weaknesses. The paper then suggests improvements to these protocols. The paper proposes secure end-to-end protocols between mobile users using both symmetric and public key based systems. These protocols enable mutual authentication and establish a shared secret key between mobile users. Furthermore, these protocols provide a certain degree of anonymity of the communicating users to be achieved vis-a-vis other system users. 1 Introduction The rapid progress of portable communications technology is making m [...] ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an approach {{for the development}} of model-checkers in a framework, called TOM, merging declarative and imperative features. We illustrate our method by specifying in TOM the Needham-Schroeder public-key protocol that aims to establish a mutual <b>authentication</b> between an <b>initiator</b> and a responder that communicate via an insecure network. We describe the behavior of the agents exchanging messages as well as the intruders and the security invariants the protocol should verify using the rewrite rules of TOM. The (depth-first or breadth-first) exploration of the search space is described using the imperative features of the language. We propose several optimizations and we compare our results to existing approaches...|$|R

Copyright Notice Copyright (C) The Internet Society (2005). The IPsec, Internet Key Exchange (IKE), and IKEv 2 protocols rely on security algorithms to provide privacy and <b>authentication</b> between the <b>initiator</b> and responder. There are many such algorithms available, and two IPsec systems cannot interoperate unless they are using the same algorithms. This document specifies optional suites of algorithms and attributes {{that can be used}} to simplify the administration of IPsec when used in manual keying mode, with IKEv 1 or with IKEv 2. 1...|$|R

This paper describes {{the way the}} Needham-Schroeder Public-Key protocol is specified in ELAN, the system developed in Nancy to model and compute in the rewriting calculus. The protocol aims to establish a mutual <b>authentication</b> between an <b>initiator</b> and a responder that communicate via an insecure network. The protocol {{has been shown to}} be vulnerable and a correction has been proposed. The behavior of the agents and of the intruders as well as the security invariants the protocol should verify are naturally described by conditional rewrite rules whose application is controlled by strategies. Similar attacks to those already described in the literature have been discovered. We show how different strategies using the same set of rewrite rules can improve the efficiency in finding the attacks and we compare our results to existing approaches...|$|R
