We employed a configuration in which the optical fiber conversion, i. e., electrical-to-optical (E/O) conversion (vice versa (O/E)), is performed on a received signal <b>amplified</b> by an <b>automatic</b> <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> (AGC) amplifier in the IF stage in order to abate {{the impact of the}} noise component generated by the E/O (O/E) converters. We first show by computer simulation the superiority of the optical fiber conversion in the IF stage to that in the radio frequency (RF) stage from the viewpoint of reducing the bit error rate (BER) performance. Furthermore, experimental results elucidate that the loss in the required transmit signal energy per bit-to-background noise power spectrum density ratio (E b /N 0) of the implemented CAAAD receiver at the average BER of 10 employing the optical fiber feeders in the IF stage compared to that with coaxial cables is within a mere 0. 2 dB (6 antennas, 3 users, 2 -path Rayleigh fading channel model, and the ratio of the target signal energy per bit-to-interference power spectrum density ratio (E b /I 0) of the desired user to that of the interfering users for fast transmission power control is DE b / I 0 = - 15 dB) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A {{low-cost}} R-R interval telemeter with <b>automatic</b> <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> is {{the innovative}} ECG measurement system for both clinical care and homecare. Highly-reliable R-R interval detection {{was achieved by}} the <b>automatic</b> <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> for subjects at different ages. The gain is automatically adjusted to extract R waves at the desired voltage amplitude. The high accuracy detection with <b>automatic</b> <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> was proved by the estimation of error occurrence at each subject. The errors of R-R interval detection did occur at less than 2 % probabilities. The accuracy detection of long-term measurement is also a crucial issue for the appropriate diagnosis. The results showed 0. 752 % probabilities of reoccurring errors when 48 hours measurement was executed. Therefore, a low cost R-R interval telemeter with <b>automatic</b> <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> is the handheld device with the high accuracy detection of R waves and the high reliability of measurement at different ages...|$|R
