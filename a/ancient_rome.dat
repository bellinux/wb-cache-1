5|$|Crawford's statue was {{designed}} in the early 1850s. It was originally to be crowned with a pileus, the cap given to emancipated slaves in <b>ancient</b> <b>Rome.</b> Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, a Southerner who would later serve as President of the Confederate States of America, was concerned that the pileus would be taken as an abolitionist symbol. He ordered that it be changed to a helmet.|$|E
5|$|During his education, {{he became}} active in {{university}} politics, and in 1563 {{he was elected}} the rector of the law department.

5|$|Etruscan {{architecture}} {{was created}} between about 700 BC and 200 BC, when the expanding civilization of <b>ancient</b> <b>Rome</b> finally absorbed Etruscan civilization. The Etruscans were considerable builders in stone, wood {{and other materials}} of temples, houses, tombs and city walls, as well as bridges and roads. The only structures remaining in quantity in anything like their original condition are tombs and walls, but through archaeology and other sources {{we have a good}} deal of information on what once existed.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Ancient</b> <b>Rome</b> {{people did}} not eat or drink with the same pottery as that used by someone who was {{affected}}. People of the time would spit on their chest believing that this would keep the problem from affected them. According to Apuleius and other ancient physicians, in order detect epilepsy it was common to light a piece of gagates, whose smoke would trigger the seizure. Occasionally a spinning potter's wheel was used, perhaps a reference to photosensitive epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|In most cultures, {{persons with}} {{epilepsy}} have been stigmatized, shunned, or even imprisoned; in the Salpêtrière, {{the birthplace of}} modern neurology, Jean-Martin Charcot found people with epilepsy side-by-side with the mentally ill, those with chronic syphilis, and the criminally insane. In <b>ancient</b> <b>Rome,</b> epilepsy {{was known as the}} morbus comitialis ('disease of the assembly hall') and was seen as a curse from the gods.

5|$|Masaccio {{is often}} {{compared}} to contemporaries like Donatello and Brunelleschi as {{a pioneer of}} the renaissance, particularly for his use of single-point perspective. One technique that was unique to Masaccio, however, {{was the use of}} atmospheric, or aerial perspective. Both the mountains in the background, and the figure of Peter on the left are dimmer and paler than the objects in the foreground, creating an illusion of depth. This technique was known in <b>ancient</b> <b>Rome,</b> but was considered lost until reinvented by Masaccio.|$|E
5|$|Objects {{connected}} with death, in particular sarcophagi and cinerary urns, {{form the basis}} of much of current knowledge of the ancient Etruscan civilization and its art, which once competed with the culture of <b>ancient</b> <b>Rome,</b> but was eventually absorbed into it. The sarcophagi and the lids of the urns often incorporate a reclining image of the deceased. The reclining figures in some Etruscan funerary art are shown using the mano cornuta to protect the grave.|$|E
5|$|Romulus Augustulus (c. AD 460–after AD 476; {{apparently}} {{still alive}} {{as late as}} AD 507), formally known as Romulus Augustus, was a Roman emperor and alleged usurper who ruled the Western Roman Empire from 31 October AD 475 until 4 September AD 476. His deposition by Odoacer traditionally {{marks the end of}} the Roman Empire in the West, the fall of <b>Ancient</b> <b>Rome,</b> {{and the beginning of the}} Middle Ages in Western Europe.|$|E
50|$|The {{military}} engineering of <b>Ancient</b> <b>Rome's</b> armed forces {{was of a}} scale and frequency far beyond that of any of its contemporaries'. Indeed, {{military engineering}} {{was in many ways}} institutionally endemic in Roman military culture, as demonstrated by the fact that each Roman legionary had as part of his equipment a shovel, alongside his gladius (sword) and pila (spears).|$|R

5|$|The gesture {{dates back}} to Ancient Greece {{and it was also}} used in <b>Ancient</b> <b>Rome.</b> Historically, it {{represented}} the phallus. In some modern cultures, it has gained increasing recognition as a sign of disrespect, and has been used by music artists (notably more common among hardcore punk bands and rappers), actors, celebrities, athletes, and politicians. Most still view the gesture as obscene. The index finger and ring finger besides the middle finger in more contemporary periods has been likened to represent the testicles.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of the Ancient Greek diet was bread, and this was accompanied by goat's cheese, olives, figs, fish, and occasionally meat. The vegetables grown included onions, garlic, cabbages, melons, and lentils. In <b>Ancient</b> <b>Rome,</b> a thick porridge was made of emmer wheat or beans, accompanied by green vegetables but little meat, and fish was not esteemed. The Romans grew broad beans, peas, onions and turnips and ate the leaves of beets rather than their roots.|$|E
5|$|The {{sight of}} {{elephants}} executing captives both horrified and attracted {{the interest of}} European travelers, and was recorded in numerous contemporary journals and accounts of life in Asia. The practice was eventually suppressed by the European empires that colonised {{the region in the}} 18th and 19th centuries. While primarily confined to Asia, the practice was occasionally adopted by Western powers, such as <b>Ancient</b> <b>Rome</b> and Carthage, particularly to deal with mutinous soldiers.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{classical}} era, {{the concept of}} the parasite was not strictly pejorative: becoming a parasitos was an accepted lifestyle, in which a person could live off the hospitality of others, and in return provide [...] "flattery, simple services, and a willingness to endure humiliation". The parasitus had a recognised role as a client in <b>ancient</b> <b>Rome's</b> system of patronage.|$|R
2500|$|Roman mythology is {{the body}} of {{traditional}} stories pertaining to <b>ancient</b> <b>Rome's</b> legendary origins and religious system, as represented in the literature and visual arts of the Romans.

5|$|The {{standard}} {{versions of}} the life of Archimedes were written long after his death by the historians of <b>Ancient</b> <b>Rome.</b> The account of the siege of Syracuse given by Polybius in his Universal History was written around seventy years after Archimedes' death, and was used subsequently as a source by Plutarch and Livy. It sheds little light on Archimedes as a person, and focuses on the war machines that he is said to have built in order to defend the city.|$|E
5|$|Three-dimensional space can be {{represented}} convincingly in art, as in technical drawing, by means other than perspective. Oblique projections, including cavalier perspective (used by French military artists to depict fortifications in the 18th century), were used continuously and ubiquitously by Chinese artists from {{the first or second}} centuries until the 18th century. The Chinese acquired the technique from India, which acquired it from <b>Ancient</b> <b>Rome.</b> Oblique projection is seen in Japanese art, such as in the Ukiyo-e paintings of Torii Kiyonaga (1752–1815).|$|E
5|$|Throughout history, {{societies}} have had numbers they consider special. For example, in <b>ancient</b> <b>Rome</b> the number 7 was auspicious, in Maya civilisation the number 13 was sacred, in modern-day Japan people give three, five, or seven gifts for luck, and in China the number 8 is considered lucky and 4 is avoided whenever possible. In Western cultures the number 13 is often considered unlucky, hence the term triskaidekaphobia, {{fear of the}} number 13.|$|E
