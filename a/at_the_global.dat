5|$|Thorpe's first {{international}} appearance {{in his home}} country, at the 1998 World Championships in Perth, began with the 4×200m freestyle relay. Swimming the third leg after Klim and Hackett, Thorpe broke away from 200m butterfly Olympic champion Tom Malchow to set a split time of 1min 47.67s, just 0.26 seconds slower than Klim's winning time in the 200m final. By the end of Thorpe's leg, the Australians were two seconds ahead of the world record pace, and three seconds ahead of the Americans, having extended the lead by two body lengths. Although anchorman Kowalski finished outside the world record, {{it was the first}} time that Australia had won the event <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> level since 1956.
