5|$|Fungi are {{the sources}} of many types of {{medicinal}} drug including antibiotics, immunosuppressants, and statins. Major classes of antibiotics, the penicillins and the cephalosporins, are derived from substances produced by fungi. So <b>also</b> <b>are</b> the immunosuppressant macrolides, the cyclosporins.|$|E
5|$|Other jet streams also exist. During the Northern Hemisphere summer, easterly jets {{can form}} in {{tropical}} regions, typically where dry air encounters more humid air at high altitudes. Low-level jets <b>also</b> <b>are</b> typical of various regions {{such as the}} central United States.|$|E
5|$|Other {{official}} state dogs <b>also</b> <b>are</b> indigenous to their state, including the Boston Terrier (Massachusetts) and the Alaskan Malamute (Alaska). Pennsylvania selected the Great Dane {{not because of}} its origin, {{but because it was}} introduced by early settlers in the state {{to be used as a}} hunting and working dog; it was chosen over the Beagle, which was also proposed around the same time.|$|E

5|$|Sharks {{tend to be}} seen {{quite often}} in {{cartoons}} whenever a scene involves the ocean. Such examples include the Tom and Jerry cartoons, Jabberjaw, and other shows produced by Hanna-Barbera. They <b>also</b> <b>are</b> used commonly as a clichéd means of killing off a character that is held up by a rope or some similar object as the sharks swim right below them, or the character may be standing on a plank above shark infested waters.|$|E
5|$|The central siren {{is located}} at the Briarcliff Manor Village Hall. Since the 1950s, {{additional}} sirens have been located on Schrade Road and at the intersection of Long Hill and Scarborough roads. Firemen <b>also</b> <b>are</b> issued small radio receivers to send a signal of a fire's location and which trucks should be sent. Company officers additionally have two-way radios.|$|E
5|$|The paper's {{coverage}} {{centers on}} local news with moderate reporting on state {{issues that affect}} Fairbanks and the surrounding area. Local sports, particularly the Alaska Goldpanners (Alaska Baseball League), Fairbanks Ice Dogs (North American Hockey League), and the various sports teams of the University of Alaska Fairbanks are covered regularly by the newspaper. The News-Miner produces several specialty publications {{in addition to the}} regular paper. Two publications: Latitude 65, a weekly arts supplement released on Friday; and Sundays, a feature reporting section published on Sundays; <b>also</b> <b>are</b> produced by newspaper staff. Several annual publications — a visitors' guide, winter survival guide, and others — <b>also</b> <b>are</b> released by the newspaper on a regular basis.|$|E

5|$|There <b>also</b> <b>are</b> various altars {{and sculptures}} used as {{decoration}} in the facades of buildings; most Quiriguá monuments have a grand formal monumentality that is rather stiff {{compared to the}} naturalistic grace {{of the art of}} some other Maya sites. Traces of red pigment have been found on some of the monuments and most of the monuments were likely to have been painted red, the colour of birth, sacrifice, and renewal.|$|E
5|$|Two {{antennae}} ("feelers") {{are attached}} to the head; these organs detect chemicals, air currents, and vibrations; they <b>also</b> <b>are</b> used to transmit and receive signals through touch. The head has two strong jaws, the mandibles, used to carry food, manipulate objects, construct nests, and for defence. In some species, a small pocket (infrabuccal chamber) inside the mouth stores food, so it may be passed to other ants or their larvae.|$|E
5|$|A line of rats with {{hereditary}} kidney cancer {{were developed}} by Japanese researchers. They have a mutation in the FLCN homolog that produces a truncated protein, though they do not develop the cutaneous or pulmonary symptoms seen in humans. Heterozygotes have renal abnormalities seen very early in life that develop into clear cell and hybrid tumors, significantly shortening the animals' lifespan; they <b>also</b> <b>are</b> prone to endometrial and salivary gland clear cell hyperplasia as well as rhabdomyolysis. Homozygotes do not survive to birth. When a wild-type FLCN gene was added, the phenotype was rescued.|$|E
50|$|Hyperprolactinaemia can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> a part {{of normal}} body changes during {{pregnancy}} and breastfeeding. It can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> caused by diseases affecting the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. It can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> caused by disruption of the normal regulation of prolactin levels by drugs, medicinal herbs and heavy metals inside the body. Hyperprolactinaemia may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> the result of disease of other organs such as the liver, kidneys, ovaries and thyroid.|$|R

5|$|A precise {{description}} {{and interpretation of}} the work has remained elusive since its initial discovery in the 19th century. Scholars agree on some aspects and disagree on others. British Greek art scholar Martin Robertson notes that both women can be seen wearing the tubular peplos garment common to the Classical period. According to the descriptive text found in the Atlas database of the exhibited works of art at the Louvre, the women <b>also</b> <b>are</b> wearing a kekryphalos, a hairnet in the Greco-Roman hairstyle, and appear to hold a type of flower, perhaps poppy or pomegranate. One {{of the women in}} the stele carries what resembles a bag, presumed to be carrying seeds in the interpretation.|$|E
5|$|A surface weather {{analysis}} {{is a type}} of weather map that depicts positions for high and low-pressure areas, as well as various types of synoptic scale systems such as frontal zones. Isotherms can be drawn on these maps, which are lines of equal temperature. Isotherms are drawn normally as solid lines at a preferred temperature interval. They show temperature gradients, which can be useful in finding fronts, which are on the warm side of large temperature gradients. By plotting the freezing line, isotherms can be useful in determination of precipitation type. Mesoscale boundaries such as tropical cyclones, outflow boundaries and squall lines <b>also</b> <b>are</b> analyzed on surface weather analyses.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{theology}} of Twelvers, the Twelve Imams are exemplary human individuals who not only rule over the community with justice, but <b>also</b> <b>are</b> able to keep and interpret sharia and the esoteric meaning of the Quran. Muhammad and Imams' words and deeds are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin (known as ismah, or infallibility) and must be chosen by divine decree, or nass, through the Prophet.|$|E

5|$|Anthropomorphised ants {{have often}} been used in fables and children's stories to {{represent}} industriousness and cooperative effort. They <b>also</b> <b>are</b> mentioned in religious texts. In the Book of Proverbs in the Bible, ants are held up as a good example for humans for their hard work and cooperation. Aesop did the same in his fable The Ant and the Grasshopper. In the Quran, Sulayman {{is said to have}} heard and understood an ant warning other ants to return home to avoid being accidentally crushed by Sulayman and his marching army. In parts of Africa, ants are considered to be the messengers of the deities. Some Native American mythology, such as the Hopi mythology, considers ants as the very first animals. Ant bites are often said to have curative properties. The sting of some species of Pseudomyrmex is claimed to give fever relief. Ant bites are used in the initiation ceremonies of some Amazon Indian cultures as a test of endurance.|$|E
5|$|Ants <b>also</b> <b>are</b> quite popular {{inspiration}} for many science-fiction insectoids, {{such as the}} Formics of Ender's Game, the Bugs of Starship Troopers, the giant ants in the films Them! and Empire of the Ants, Marvel Comics' super hero Ant-Man, and ants mutated into super-intelligence in Phase IV. In computer strategy games, ant-based species often benefit from increased production rates due to their single-minded focus, such as the Klackons in the Master of Orion series of games or the ChCht in Deadlock II. These characters are often credited with a hive mind, a common misconception about ant colonies.|$|E
5|$|Ants form {{symbiotic}} {{associations with}} a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They <b>also</b> <b>are</b> preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.|$|E

5|$|Beilein {{is known}} for his Princeton {{offensive}} system, which emphasizes constant motion, passing, disciplined teamwork, and precision shooting. The offense usually starts out with four players outside the three-point arc, and one player {{at the top of the}} key (though at times a post player may operate closer to the basket). From this formation, Beilein's teams not only try to open up space for players to cut to the basket, but <b>also</b> <b>are</b> known for their high number of three-point attempts. On defense, Beilein has become known for employing the 1–3–1 halfcourt zone defense, which is considered to be an unconventional zone defense – though he also regularly employs man-to-man and 2-3 zone defenses.|$|E
5|$|Drugs <b>also</b> <b>are</b> used {{to inhibit}} enzymes {{needed for the}} {{survival}} of pathogens. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick cell wall made of a net-like polymer called peptidoglycan. Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together. This causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria to burst. In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the transpeptidase from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E
