50|$|The African pied wagtail, or <b>African</b> <b>wagtail,</b> (Motacilla aguimp) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Motacillidae.|$|E
50|$|There are {{currently}} two recognised subspecies of the <b>African</b> Pied <b>wagtail.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{scientific}} binomial for the <b>African</b> pied <b>wagtail</b> is Motacilla aguimp; Motacilla, {{the name}} of the genus containing all but the forest wagtail of Asia, is from the Latin for a “little mover” while the specific name aguimp from the French for “with a wimple” which refers to the black hood of the <b>African</b> pied <b>wagtail.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> pied <b>wagtail</b> is monogamous, the {{cup-shaped}} nest {{is lined}} with grass and feathers and is usually situated near water in a convenient tangle of sticks. In settlements the nest may be located on buildings. The nests of the <b>African</b> pied <b>wagtail</b> are parasitised by the red-chested cuckoo Cuculus solitarius and the diderick cuckoo Chrysococcyx caprius. While chicks have been recorded as prey of Burchell's coucal Centropus burchellii.|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> pied <b>wagtail</b> {{is mainly}} insectivorous but also feeds on other invertebrates, grass seeds, tadpoles, small fish and scraps of human food.|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> pied <b>wagtail</b> inhabits {{subtropical}} or tropical seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland, rivers, and, sometimes, freshwater marshes. In {{some areas}} it is commensal with humans in towns and villages.|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> pied <b>wagtail</b> {{is found}} in Sub-saharan Africa from the Eastern Cape north to extreme {{southern}} Egypt and from Guinea to western Eritrea and Somalia. It is a vagrant to Burkina Faso, Gambia, Mauritania and the Western Cape.|$|R
50|$|In Malawi <b>African</b> Pied <b>wagtails</b> started {{breeding}} {{before the}} rains {{and continue to}} breed into the rainy season, they bred for {{six months of the}} year peaking in March and October. Both the males and females participate in nest building but only the female incubates but both sexes feed the young. The mean clutch was 3.9 eggs.|$|R
50|$|Among the <b>wagtails</b> the <b>African</b> pied <b>wagtail</b> is most {{similar in}} {{appearance}} to the recently discovered Mekong wagtail but genetic {{evidence suggests that}} the two are each other's closest relatives and are each just as related to other black and white wagtails such as the white wagtail M. alba complex or the white-browed wagtail M. maderaspatensis.|$|R
50|$|The Mekong wagtail (Motacilla samveasnae) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Motacillidae. It was first {{described}} in 2001 and named in honour of the late Cambodian ornithologist Sam Veasna. It is {{a black and white}} bird, similar in appearance to the <b>African</b> pied <b>wagtail,</b> although their ranges do not overlap. Its facial features and distinctive voice distinguish it from other black and white wagtails in southeastern Asia.|$|R
5000|$|The {{species was}} {{overlooked}} until 2001 {{when it was}} described. It is named in honour of the late Cambodian ornithologist Sam Veasna. [...] It is most similar in appearance to the <b>African</b> pied <b>wagtail</b> but genetic {{evidence suggests that the}} two are not more closely related to each other compared to other black and white wagtails such as the white wagtail M. alba complex or the white-browed wagtail M. maderaspatensis.|$|R
50|$|The Mekong wagtail {{most closely}} resembles <b>African</b> pied <b>wagtail</b> M. aguimp, {{although}} two species ranges are far apart. It differs from M. agiump in several minor respects, particularly wing pattern, and its vocalisations are very distinctive. It {{is a very}} distinctive species {{and is the only}} black-and-white wagtail in South-East Asia which exhibits the plumage character combination of black forehead, lores and ear coverts, obvious white supercilia, with white a throat and neck patch.|$|R
50|$|The {{origin of}} the genus {{appears to be in}} the general area of Eastern Siberia/Mongolia. Wagtails spread rapidly across Eurasia and {{dispersed}} to Africa in the Zanclean (Early Pliocene)where the sub-Saharan lineage was later isolated. The <b>African</b> pied <b>wagtail</b> (and possibly the Mekong wagtail) diverged prior to the massive radiation of the white-bellied black-throated and most yellow-bellied forms, all of which took place during the late Piacenzian (early Late Pliocene), c. 3 mya.|$|R
5000|$|Three {{species are}} poly- or paraphyletic {{in the present}} taxonomical {{arrangement}} and either subspecies need to be reassigned and/or species split up. The blue-headed wagtail (AKA yellow wagtail and many other names), especially, {{has always been a}} taxonomical nightmare with over a dozen currently accepted subspecies and many more invalid ones. The two remaining [...] "monochrome" [...] species, Mekong and <b>African</b> pied <b>wagtail</b> may be closely related, or a most striking example of convergent evolution.|$|R
50|$|Stuart Baker in {{his second}} edition of The Fauna of British India {{considered}} this as a subspecies of the white wagtail, calling it Motacilla lugubris maderaspatensis. This was however criticized by C B Ticehurst, who noted that it was much larger, never had the white forehead of the white wagtail, was non-migratory and lacked a spring moult. This species is now considered to form a superspecies with Japanese wagtail, Mekong wagtail and the more distant <b>African</b> pied <b>wagtail.</b> Similarities in pre-copulatory behaviour with the Japanese wagtail have been noted. Its song much resembles that of the recently described Mekong wagtail. mtDNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data {{has not been able}} to robustly resolve the relationships of these birds, especially in respect to the blue-headed wagtail and its relatives.|$|R
