5|$|During {{this period}} Van Gogh {{mastered}} {{the use of}} light by subjugating shadows and painting the trees {{as if they are}} the source of light – almost in a sacred manner. Early the following year he painted another smaller group of orchards, including View of <b>Arles,</b> Flowering Orchards. Van Gogh was enthralled by the landscape and vegetation of the south of France, and often visited the farm gardens near <b>Arles.</b> In the vivid light of the Mediterranean climate his palette significantly brightened.|$|E

5|$|When Gauguin {{agreed to}} visit <b>Arles</b> in 1888, Van Gogh hoped for friendship, and the {{realisation}} of {{his idea of}} an artists' collective. While waiting, in August he painted Sunflowers. When Boch visited again, Van Gogh painted a portrait of him, {{as well as the}} study The Poet Against a Starry Sky.|$|E

50|$|When <b>Arle</b> arrives, {{something}} {{does not appear}} right, and Carbuncle disappears once more. <b>Arle</b> has to navigate her way past a number of foes as before. During her quest Draco, Seriri, Witch and Chiko join up with <b>Arle</b> as they face Schezo and Rulue. Rulue knew something was up with Satan, and as <b>Arle</b> met him, he appeared strange and unlike his normal self. He freezes the other characters {{so that they do}} not interfere. <b>Arle</b> beats Satan, who wakes up and asks why <b>Arle</b> was there. Satan explains to <b>Arle</b> that he was brainwashed by a stronger foe, and Pierrot appears afterwards, revealing herself to be Doppelganger <b>Arle.</b> The two have a fight to see who exists in the world, and <b>Arle</b> was victorious.|$|R
50|$|<b>Arle</b> is a {{district}} of Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, England. It was historically a manorial estate which owned {{parts of the}} town now known as Hesters Way, Fiddlers Green, <b>Arle</b> and Benhall. The names <b>Arle</b> Court, <b>Arle</b> House and <b>Arle</b> Mill are relics of the historic past. Much of the area was market gardens and orchards in the early 20th Century.|$|R
5|$|By the 4th {{century the}} Roman {{province}} of Britannia was converted to Christianity {{and had even}} produced its own heretic in Pelagius. Britain sent three bishops to the Synod of <b>Arles</b> in 314, and a Gaulish bishop went to the island in 396 to help settle disciplinary matters. Lead baptismal basins and other artefacts bearing Christian symbols testify to a growing Christian presence at least until about 360.|$|E
5|$|Cissé {{started his}} career at AC <b>Arles</b> in 1989 {{at the age of}} eight. After seven years at the club, he had a six-month spell at Nîmes Olympique before moving to Auxerre joining the club's youth system. Cissé spent two years in the system before graduating to the first team in 1998. After playing for Auxerre for six seasons, scoring 90 goals in 166 appearances, he moved to Premier League club Liverpool in 2004.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for Gauguin's visit, Van Gogh bought two beds on {{advice from the}} station's postal supervisor Joseph Roulin, whose portrait he painted. On 17 September he spent his first night in the still sparsely furnished Yellow House. When Gauguin consented to work and live in <b>Arles</b> with him, Van Gogh started {{to work on the}} Décoration for the Yellow House, probably the most ambitious effort he ever undertook. He completed two chair paintings: Van Gogh's Chair and Gauguin's Chair.|$|E
50|$|In this 13-stage mode, {{you play}} as the {{original}} protagonist, <b>Arle</b> Nadja. <b>Arle</b> as a COM AI is rather strong. As <b>Arle,</b> {{you have to fight}} Draco Centauros, Incubus, Suketoudara, Kiki-Mora, Nohoho, Kidomo Dragon, Witch, Honey Bee, Zoh-Daimaoh, Lagnus the Brave, Rulue, Schezo, and Satan. Incubus, who was brought back from the CD versions of Puyo Puyo Tsu, continued to try and seduce <b>Arle</b> with his charm. As for Kiki-Mora, she's a maid that has an insane habit of cleaning things. Kidomo Dragon tries to catch <b>Arle</b> and claim her to be a rare jungle creature. Honey Bee tries to poke <b>Arle</b> with her giant syringe, and Lagnus the Brave is seen poking a Green Puyo when <b>Arle</b> comes across, turns into an adult, threatens to slice <b>Arle</b> with his sword, until his trousers fall down and <b>Arle</b> goes bright red.|$|R
5000|$|After the fight, Doppelganger <b>Arle</b> {{insists that}} she is [...] "The Real Arle" [...] who existed in the world, feeling {{weakened}} by her defeat, she soon fades away, much to <b>Arle's</b> shock. Seconds later, Carbuncle reappeared {{in the room and}} <b>Arle</b> was thrilled to see him again. The gem on Carbuncle's forehead shines and <b>Arle</b> asks what was wrong, he discharges the beam from his forehead and the screen fades to white then black, and the credits roll.|$|R
50|$|Ringo is the {{intelligent}} main protagonist of the game. She lives {{in yet another}} different universe to <b>Arle</b> and Amitie, and is taught {{how to play the}} game of Puyo by <b>Arle</b> when a horde of them flood her school. Her name means apple.|$|R
5|$|In {{the sixth}} century, Caesarius of <b>Arles</b> taught {{that the whole}} glory of the Jewish Sabbath had been {{transferred}} to Sunday and that Christians must keep Sunday {{in the same way}} as the Jews were commanded to keep the Sabbath. The Council of Orléans in 538 reprobated this tendency, to apply the law of the Jewish Sabbath to the observance of the Christian Sunday, as Jewish and non-Christian.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh {{made several}} {{painting}} excursions during {{visits to the}} landscape around <b>Arles.</b> He made paintings of harvests, wheat fields and other rural landmarks of the area, including The Old Mill (1888); {{a good example of}} a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields beyond. At various points, Van Gogh painted the view from his window – at The Hague, Antwerp, and Paris. These works culminated in The Wheat Field series, which depicted the view from his cells in the asylum at Saint-Rémy.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh {{strove to}} be a painter of rural life and nature, and {{during his first}} summer in <b>Arles</b> he used his new palette to paint landscapes and {{traditional}} rural life. His belief that a power existed behind the natural led {{him to try to}} capture a sense of that power, or the essence of nature in his art, sometimes through the use of symbols. His renditions of the sower, at first copied from Jean-François Millet, reflect Van Gogh's religious beliefs: the sower as Christ sowing life beneath the hot sun. These were themes and motifs he returned to often to rework and develop. His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism, but rather than use traditional Christian iconography he made up his own, where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life. In <b>Arles,</b> having gained confidence after painting spring blossoms and learning to capture bright sunlight, he was ready to paint The Sower.|$|E
5000|$|Satan, {{the main}} [...] "villain" [...] from the {{previous}} games, is once again up to no good. He splits up five gold runes, and they are handed off to different individuals across the globe. Satan then sets up a Puyo Puyo contest. Carbuncle runs off for it, and <b>Arle</b> gives chase, thus starting her strange journey to collect the runes and find Carbuncle. At the end, it is revealed that the runes are actually a ticket for <b>Arle</b> and himself to go and bathe at some hot springs, made from the finest curry powder with the faintest scent for Carbuncle to trace. <b>Arle</b> then breaks the curry blocks, foiling Satan once again and leaving him to cry hysterically, whilst <b>Arle</b> uses the blocks to make curry.|$|R

50|$|After a {{match with}} Klug, Ringo decides {{that in order}} to solve the problem, she must travel to seven power spots of the planet, encountering the strongest opponents. During the trek, she {{discovered}} that <b>Arle</b> has become possessed by a new adversary, Ecolo. When Ringo comes upon the newly transformed Dark <b>Arle,</b> she defeats her, reverting her to normal. Ecolo decides to bury the universe in Puyos just for amusement. Ringo, <b>Arle,</b> and Amitie team up with her to save the day. Ecolo is defeated, and everyone is unharmed.|$|R
5|$|Calment {{was born}} in <b>Arles,</b> Bouches-du-Rhone, Southern France on 21 February 1875. Her father, Nicolas Calment (28 January 1838 – 22 January 1931), was a shipbuilder, and her mother, Marguerite Gilles (20 February 1838 – 18 September 1924), was {{from a family of}} millers. She had an older brother, François (25 April 1865 – 1 December 1962). Some of her close family members also lived an above-average lifespan, {{although}} none lived anywhere near as long as Jeanne: her older brother François lived to the age of 97, her father to six days shy of 93, and her mother to 86.|$|E
5|$|Coins are {{the only}} items in the Hoxne Hoard for which a {{definite}} date and place of manufacture can be established. All of the gold coins, {{and many of the}} silver coins, bear the names and portraits of the emperor in whose reign they were minted. Most also retain the original mint marks that identify where they were minted, illustrating the Roman system of regional mints producing coins to a uniform design. The coins' manufacture has been traced back to a total of 14 sources: Trier, <b>Arles</b> and Lyon (in Gaul), Ravenna, Milan, Aquileia, Rome (in modern Italy); Siscia (modern Croatia), Sirmium (modern Serbia), Thessaloniki (Greece), Constantinople, Cyzicus, Nicomedia, and Antioch (modern Turkey).|$|E
5|$|In December 1888 {{he painted}} La Berceuse – {{a figure that}} he thought {{as good as his}} sunflowers. It has a limited palette, varied brushstrokes and simple contours. It appears to be a {{culmination}} of portraits of the Roulin family completed in <b>Arles</b> between November and December. The portraits show a shift in style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and even surface of Portrait of the Postman to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of a palette knife in Madame Roulin with Baby.|$|E

50|$|In this 8-stage mode, {{you play}} as Schezo Wegey. As a COM, Schezo is almost equal to <b>Arle's</b> strength. As Schezo, {{you have to}} fight the latter 8 stages along <b>Arle's</b> quest, {{starting}} with Kidomo Dragon, and ending with Satan. Along the way, Schezo gets snagged in a net by Kidomo Dragon, and Honey Bee's giant syringe gets slotted into {{the back of his head}} (however, Schezo doesn't seem to notice it). Lagnus tries to attack Schezo, but Schezo steps out of the way, causing Lagnus to trip, and shrinking back to his kid form. Instead of facing himself at Stage 7, he faces <b>Arle.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Emperors Hadrian, Septimius Severus and Constantius I all held {{court in}} York during their various campaigns. During his stay 207–211AD, the Emperor Severus proclaimed York {{capital of the}} {{province}} of Britannia Inferior, {{and it is likely}} that it was he who granted York the privileges of a colonia or city. Constantius I died in 306AD during his stay in York, and his son Constantine the Great was proclaimed Emperor by the troops based in the fortress. In 311AD a bishop from York attended the Council at <b>Arles</b> to represent Christians from the province.|$|E
5|$|The {{sunflowers}} {{were painted}} {{to decorate the}} walls in anticipation of Gauguin's visit, and Van Gogh placed individual works around the Yellow House's guest room in <b>Arles.</b> Gauguin was deeply impressed and later acquired two of the Paris versions. After Gauguin's departure, Van Gogh imagined the two major versions of the sunflowers as wings of the Berceuse Triptych, and included them in his Les XX in Brussels exhibit. Today the major pieces of the series are among his best known, celebrated for the sickly connotations of the colour yellow and its tie-in with the Yellow House, the expressionism of the brush strokes, and their contrast against often dark backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|The time in <b>Arles</b> {{became one}} of Van Gogh's more {{prolific}} periods: he completed 200 paintings, and more than 100 drawings and watercolours. He was enchanted by the local landscape and light; his works from this period are rich in yellow, ultramarine and mauve. His paintings include harvests, wheat fields and general rural landmarks from the area, including The Old Mill (1888), a picturesque structure bordering the wheat fields. This was one of seven canvases sent to Pont-Aven on 4 October 1888 in an exchange of works with Paul Gauguin, Émile Bernard, Charles Laval and others.|$|E

5|$|There {{are more}} than 600 letters from Vincent to Theo and around 40 from Theo to Vincent. There are 22 to his sister Wil, 58 to the painter Anthon van Rappard, 22 to Émile Bernard as well as {{individual}} letters to Paul Signac, Paul Gauguin and the critic Albert Aurier. Some are illustrated with sketches. Many are undated, but art historians have been able to place most in chronological order. Problems in transcription and dating remain, mainly with those posted from <b>Arles.</b> While there Vincent wrote around 200 letters in Dutch, French and English. There is a gap in the record when he lived in Paris as the brothers lived together and had no need to correspond.|$|E
5|$|Augustine {{established}} his episcopal see at Canterbury. It {{is not clear}} when and where Augustine was consecrated as a bishop. Bede, writing about a century later, states that Augustine was consecrated by the Frankish Archbishop Ætherius of <b>Arles,</b> Gaul (France) after the conversion of Æthelberht. Contemporary letters from Pope Gregory, however, refer to Augustine as a bishop before he arrived in England. A letter of Gregory's from September 597 calls Augustine a bishop, and one dated ten months later says Augustine had been consecrated on Gregory's command by bishops of the German lands. The historian R. A. Markus discusses the various theories of when and where Augustine was consecrated, and suggests he was consecrated before arriving in England, but argues the evidence does not permit deciding exactly where this took place.|$|E
5|$|Excavations {{carried out}} before the {{flooding}} of Chew Valley Lake also uncovered Roman remains, indicating agricultural and industrial activity from {{the second half of}} the 1st century until the 3rd century AD. The finds included a moderately large villa at Chew Park, where wooden writing tablets (the first in the UK) with ink writing were found. There is also evidence from the Pagans Hill Roman Temple at Chew Stoke. In October 2001 the West Bagborough Hoard of 4th century Roman silver was discovered in West Bagborough. The 681 coins included two denarii from the early 2nd century and 8 Miliarense and 671 Siliqua all dating to the period AD 337– 367. The majority were struck in the reigns of emperors Constantius II and Julian and derive from a range of mints including <b>Arles</b> and Lyons in France, Trier in Germany and Rome.|$|E
