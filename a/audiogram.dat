25|$|Since most {{persons with}} {{tinnitus}} also have hearing loss, a pure tone hearing test {{resulting in an}} <b>audiogram</b> may help diagnose a cause, though some persons with tinnitus do not have hearing loss.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Agricultural {{aviation}} pilots, exposed {{daily to}} intense vibration and noise, {{are likely to}} develop noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Objectives The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the presence of <b>audiograms</b> consistent with NIHL in agricultural aviation pilots who use earplugs and helmets. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional cohort and observational study. The data were taken from the medical records and <b>audiograms</b> of 94 pilots. Results NIHL was identified in 9. 5 % of individuals with hearing loss by <b>audiograms</b> at 3, 000, 4, 000, or 6, 000 Hz. Normal <b>audiograms</b> were observed in 46. 8 % of pilots surveyed. Bilateral hearing loss was more frequent than unilateral hearing loss, occurring in 64. 8 % of cases. Conclusion Although there was a low incidence of <b>audiograms</b> compatible with NIHL in the records of the pilots examined, the disorder still occurs despite the doubled use of individual hearing protection equipment (helmets and earplugs) for agricultural aviation pilots. Nevertheless, even with the use of earplugs and helmets as noise protectors, the data showed that agricultural pilots suffer inner ear damage caused by occupational noise. Prevention and periodic audiologic evaluations must be conducted in noiseexposed occupational groups...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Autoimmune {{inner ear}} disease (AIED) {{is a rare}} {{condition}} characterized by bilateral fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). The labile nature of this hearing loss {{makes it difficult to}} accurately quantify with conventional methods, and therefore it is challenging to rehabilitate. Methods Over a 9 -month period one pediatric patient with severe AIED was monitored and conducted home <b>audiograms</b> using a previously validated testing system (Shoebox Audiometry). During this period he also underwent several clinical <b>audiograms.</b> The correlation between clinical and home <b>audiograms</b> was analyzed with a Pearson coefficient, and the range and frequency of fluctuations was recorded. Results Sixty-four automated home <b>audiograms</b> and nine clinical <b>audiograms</b> were conducted. When tested at home using a calibrated system the pure tone average (PTA) fluctuated between 12  dB and 72  dB indicating large variability in hearing. Fluctuations were frequent: on 28 occasions the PTA varied by at least 5  dB when retested within 4  days. The mean PTA was 50  dB and 95 % of the thresholds were within 36  dB of the mean. Clinical <b>audiograms</b> obtained on the same day or within 1  day of home testing were highly concordant (with a Pearson coefficient of 0. 93). Conclusion AIED can result in significant fluctuations in hearing over short periods of time. Home testing enables a more granular look at variations over time and correlates well with clinical testing, and thus facilitates rapid action and informed rehabilitation...|$|R

25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of tinnitus is usually {{based on the}} person's description. A number of questionnaires exist that may help to assess how much tinnitus is interfering with a person's life. The diagnosis is commonly supported by an <b>audiogram</b> and a neurological examination. If certain problems are found, medical imaging, such as with MRI, may be performed. Other tests are suitable when tinnitus occurs with the same rhythm as the heartbeat. Rarely, the sound may be heard by someone else using a stethoscope, in which case it is known as objective tinnitus. Spontaneous otoacoustic emissions, which are sounds produced normally by the inner ear, may also occasionally result in tinnitus.|$|E

The <b>audiograms</b> (1 - 32 kHz) of Mpv 17 -negative mice were determined from auditory brain stem responses in young (2 months) and old (7 months) animals. <b>Audiograms</b> of age-matched wild- type mice with the same genetic background, but wild-type at the Mpv 17 locus, were also determined. Furthermore, young Mpv 17 -negative mice that carried a human Mpv 17 homologue gene were studied. NMRI mice served as a reference for normal hearing. Mpv 17 -negative mice suffer from severe sensorineural hearing loss as early as 2 months after birth. In the old Mpv 17 -negative mice no responses could be elicited at all. The 2 month old wild-type mice had normal <b>audiograms,</b> at 7 months only high threshold responses were seen. The poor <b>audiograms</b> of the Mpv 17 -negative mice are assumed to be the functional correlate of the morphological degeneration of the cochlea described earlier (Meyer zum Gottesberge et al., 1996).

40|$|We {{are working}} on the data mining of {{audiology}} patient records, looking for factors influencing which patients would most benefit from being fitted with a hearing aid. Various research groups have used statistics and neural networks for integration of data, such as the chi-squared test or self organizing maps (SOMs).

40|$|Background. Microvascular {{compressions}} of {{the cochlear}} nerve {{can lead to}} hearing loss. Due to the tonotopic organization of the cochlear nerve any focal compression of the cochlear nerve {{will result in a}} frequency specific hearing loss.

Thirty one patients underwent microvascular decompression operations of the vestibulocochlear nerve for vertigo or tinnitus. Preoperative <b>audiograms</b> were substracted from postoperative <b>audiograms</b> obtained 2 years after microvascular decompression.

Unfortunately, not all areas on the <b>audiogram</b> (taking into account frequencies and intensity levels) are equally weighted.

40|$|Most music {{teachers}} experience lengthy periods of noise exposure {{on a daily}} basis, which, if of sufficient duration and intensity, can lead to hearing damage, tinnitus, and eventual hearing loss. In this study, 30 {{music teachers}} were surveyed regarding their attitudes to music exposure, hearing protection, and symptoms of hearing damage. Pure tone <b>audiograms</b> were obtained for 28 participants. Results showed that teachers {{were aware of the}} risks associated with noise exposure, however, they believed that most of their teaching peers and students were less aware. The <b>audiograms</b> revealed reduced hearing acuity in 13 participants: Ten participants had average hearing levels > 20 -dB HL, and while this was age-appropriate for five participants, the other five had hearing worse than expected for their age. A further three participants had <b>audiograms</b> within the normal range (4 FAHL < 20 dB HL), but thresholds were worse than expected for their age. Thus, in at least eight cases, there were possible indications of hearing loss that may be noise-related. This study suggests that music teachers are at greater risk of hearing damage than the general population. We need to inform music teachers of the risk and encourage them to minimise their exposure levels in order to maintain their long-term hearing health. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity have {{historically}} been documented as relatively rare complications of vancomycin monotherapy. Recent reports have linked aggressive vancomycin dosing strategies to significant risks of nephrotoxicity. We evaluated the rate of high-frequency hearing loss detected by audiometry for patients on vancomycin therapy. For this purpose, we used retrospective case-control analysis of audiometry results for patients on vancomycin therapy for whom baseline and follow-up exams were available. Analysis of 89 patients for whom <b>audiograms</b> were performed after an average of 27 days of vancomycin therapy showed a 12 % rate of high-frequency hearing loss, with a trend in univariate analysis toward a higher rate with advanced age. The mean of the highest vancomycin trough levels for both patients with worsening <b>audiograms</b> and those without worsening <b>audiograms</b> was 19 mg/liter. Regression tree modeling demonstrated that for patients 53 years old, the incidence was 19 % (P = 0. 008). We conclude that a significant rate of high-frequency hearing loss in older patients receiving vancomycin monotherapy was detected by audiometry. While these data urge caution against continued indiscriminate vancomycin dose escalation to treat infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus strains for which vancomycin MICs are 2 mg/liter, further prospective {{studies are needed to}} determine the clinical significance and reversibility of these effects...|$|R
