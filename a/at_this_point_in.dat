5|$|This {{discretion}} and ambiguity {{is likely}} due to SEGA's desire to maintain Sonic's free and youthful nature, believing that committing to a relationship <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> his life would simply be uncharacteristic of him. In addition, given that chasing Sonic and the ensuing antics are fundamental parts of Amy's character, their relation seems unlikely to change any time soon.|$|E

5|$|Another {{issue is}} that Murray cod caught and {{released}} in winter, while developing their eggs, or in spring prior to spawning, resorb their eggs and do not spawn. This may be a minor issue compared {{to some of the}} other threats facing Murray cod, nevertheless, concerned fishermen try to avoid catching wild Murray cod at these times. <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> time a closed season is in place for the spring spawning period, during which anglers are not allowed to target Murray cod, even on a catch and release basis.|$|E

Navarro was furious when confronted by Kiedis and Flea, but {{eventually}} accepted his termination. The Chili Peppers were fighting, and on the verge of breaking up. Flea was beginning to question the band's future and thought it may be necessary to break the band up. He made one last attempt to keep the band together, asking Frusciante to rejoin. Frusciante had recently completed a drug rehabilitation program after more than five years of heroin addiction, and gladly accepted the invitation.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> her career, Sörenstam {{says she}} lost focus having reached her biggest goals. Karrie Webb became the best LPGA Tour player but Sörenstam {{still managed to}} win more LPGA tournaments than any other LPGA Tour player during the 1990s. She {{qualified}} for the World Golf Hall of Fame when she won the 2000 Welch's/Circle K Championship, but was not eligible for induction until finishing her tenth year on the LPGA tour in October 2003.

Roosevelt in turn admired Beebe's writing and his respect for the natural world. Roosevelt frequently provided praise for Beebe's books, and went on to write introductions to Beebe's books Tropical Wild Life and Jungle Peace.|$|E

5|$|Despite having bested the Romans {{in their}} battles, Pyrrhus had {{sustained}} heavy casualties. With his Italian allies wavering, Pyrrhus decided {{to abandon his}} campaign against Rome. <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> time, Pyrrhus had two options available. Firstly, he could return to Greece where the throne of Macedon had been left vacant {{by the death of}} King Ptolemy Keraunos {{at the hands of the}} Gallic invaders of Greece. Pyrrhus had coveted the Macedonian throne and had briefly held it from 287 BC to 285 BC.

Hebe's cut dialogue is occasionally restored in modern performances.|$|E
