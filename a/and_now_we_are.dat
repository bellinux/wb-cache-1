25|$|Several of Milne's children's poems {{were set}} to music by the {{composer}} Harold Fraser-Simson. His poems have been parodied many times, including with the books When We Were Rather Older <b>and</b> <b>Now</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> Sixty. The 1963 film The King's Breakfast was based on Milne's poem of the same name.|$|E
25|$|Rosenzweig's major work is The Star of Redemption (first {{published}} in 1921). It is {{a description of}} the relationships between God, humanity, and the world, as they are connected by creation, revelation and redemption. If one makes a diagram with God at the top, and the World and the Self below, the inter-relationships generate a Star of David map. He is critical of any attempt to replace actual human existence with an ideal. In Rosenzweig's scheme, revelation arises not in metaphysics but in the here <b>and</b> <b>now.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> called to love God, and to do so is to return to the world, and that is redemption.|$|E
25|$|Science is a {{magnificent}} force, {{but it is}} not a teacher of morals. It can perfect machinery, but it adds no moral restraints to protect society from the misuse of the machine. It can also build gigantic intellectual ships, but it constructs no moral rudders for the control of storm-tossed human vessel. It not only fails to supply the spiritual element needed but some of its unproven hypotheses rob the ship of its compass and thus endanger its cargo. In war, science has proven itself an evil genius; it has made war more terrible than it ever was before. Man used to be content to slaughter his fellowmen on a single plane, the earth's surface. Science has taught him to go down into the water and shoot up from below and to go up into the clouds and shoot down from above, thus making the battlefield three times as bloody as it was before; but science does not teach brotherly love. Science has made war so hellish that civilization was about to commit suicide; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> told that newly discovered instruments of destruction will make the cruelties of the late war seem trivial in comparison with the cruelties of wars that may come in the future. If civilization is to be saved from the wreckage threatened by intelligence not consecrated by love, it must be saved by the moral code of the meek and lowly Nazarene. His teachings, and His teachings alone, can solve the problems that vex the heart and perplex the world.|$|E

500|$|Some {{scientists}} now {{consider that the}} effects of global dimming have masked the effect of global warming to some extent and that resolving global dimming may therefore lead to increases in predictions of future temperature rise. According to Beate Liepert, [...] "We lived in a global warming plus a global dimming world <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> taking out global dimming. So we end up with the global warming world, which will be much worse than we thought it will be, much hotter." [...] The magnitude of this masking effect is one of the central problems in climate change with significant implications for future climate changes and policy responses to global warming.|$|E
500|$|Although Bruce had {{the largest}} {{transfer}} budget in the division made available to him, Birmingham made a slow start to the 2006–07 season in the Championship and, after a 1–0 defeat at home to Norwich City, the team's fifth consecutive match without a win, there were calls from fans and local journalists for the manager to be sacked. Bruce publicly accepted responsibility for the team's poor run and admitted that he feared for his job, but the team responded with a 1–0 victory over Derby County, and then recorded a further five consecutive league victories to be joint leaders of the league table by late November. On 29 April 2007, Birmingham secured promotion to the Premier League, with one match to play, by virtue of Derby County's 2–0 defeat at Crystal Palace. Chairman David Gold told the press [...] "There have been some dark days but Steve has been outstanding. He was determined to bounce back. He has rebuilt the team <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all back {{where we want to}} be." ...|$|E

[...] Further, the government claimed [...] "Canada was the first nation in the world to take action to prohibit the importation, sale and advertising of baby bottles that contain BPA".|$|E

2500|$|In July 2007, Russian {{officials}} announced {{a criminal investigation}} had been opened into allegations made by Vyacheslav Zharko, who had turned himself in to the FSB. Zharko said that he worked for British intelligence since 2002 and claimed that Litvinenko and Boris Berezovsky introduced him to MI6. Zharko alleged that Litvinenko planned a series of terrorism acts including murder of Russian president Vladimir Putin. An FSB spokesman said: [...] "The Brits have been waging an information war against us <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> responding in kind.".|$|E
2500|$|In Northern Ireland, Sammy Smyth, then {{press officer}} {{of both the}} Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and the Ulster Workers' Council (UWC) Strike Committee, said, [...] "I am very happy about the bombings in Dublin. There is a war with the Free State <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{laughing}} at them." [...] However, neither the UDA nor UVF admitted responsibility. A 'Captain Craig' telephoned the Irish News and Irish Times, claiming responsibility for the bombings {{on behalf of the}} 'Red Hand Brigade', which is believed to be a covername.|$|E
2500|$|Doris Zinkeisen: New Idea {{portrait}} with leaf {{background was}} the first photographic cover for The Home which was launched in Sydney in 1920 and modelled on the American magazines Vanity Fair and House & Garden.

2500|$|In {{announcing the}} change, Tiley said Plexicushion {{would have a}} [...] "lower rubber content than Rebound Ace, was firmer under foot and {{retained}} less heat through its thinner top layer." [...] Tiley later said that the change of colour, from green to blue, would also benefit players and officials, although this change was quite arbitrary. The manufacturers of Rebound Ace derided the new surface, with director Paul Bull saying that, [...] "We had an Australian icon event with a unique Australian product <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> just {{going to become a}} clone of the U.S. Open." [...] Bull also said that the inconsistencies in pace were down to the organizers' imperative, who kept asking for the pace to be adjusted to pander for certain players, such as Hewitt. Bull, however, conceded that a change was needed; and said that the suggestion of a Rebound Ace court with a rubber mat thickness of around 5mm was made.|$|E
2500|$|... 2010 {{would go}} on to become the most {{successful}} year of Rampal's career with three back to back hits. The first was Sajid Khan's comedy film Housefull, in which he starred in a supporting role. The film received negative reviews, but became a huge hit at the box office. Rampal's next release was Prakash Jha's multi-starrer Raajneeti. Rampal received critical acclaim for his supporting role of Prithvi in the movie. Taran Adarsh wrote: [...] "Arjun is a revelation and what a terrific performance he pitches in. He's like an untamed lion." [...] His performance earned him a nomination for the Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award. He won the award in the Best Supporting Actor at the IIFA, Apsara and Zee Cine categories. His last release of the year was Siddharth Malhotra and Karan Johar's We Are Family, in which he played a lead role opposite Kajol and Kareena Kapoor. It was an average grosser and Rampal's first successful movie that featured him in a lead role. Taran Adarsh wrote: [...] "Arjun continues to surprise. Rock On!!, Housefull, Raajneeti <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> Family indicates the growth of this actor. He handles the emotional moments well, too." ...|$|E

Leaving the rifle behind, I drove the long blade of my knife deep down for a hand-hold before the first move.|$|R

In responding to a toast, the 17-year-old Celua said in Fijian: [...] "I thank you for so heartily drinking this toast. Speechmaking is a new thing to me, you must therefore please excuse my words being few. I come from a once dark land – a land of cannibal cruelty – but Christianity has raised us from the lowest degradation, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> a Christian people. We are now trying to establish law and order in our land, and I ask you to help us. We most earnestly desire the establishment of law, and if you will help us it can be done. We want to govern Fiji in every respect as this land is governed. I have come to white man's land to be trained at Newington College. I am anxious to be taught. You were born in the light, I in the darkness. You were born in a Christian land, I in a heathen country. I wish to be trained here that I may be of service in the government of my own country. Again I thank you for so heartily drinking prosperity to Fiji." ...|$|E
