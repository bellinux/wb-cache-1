40|$|A {{detailed}} set of thermoluminescence, cathodoluminescence and radioluminescence (TL, CLTL and RLTL) data of lead tungstate, Spodumene and Topaz {{have been}} reported {{for the first time}} over a wide temperature range from 25 to 500 K. Lead tungstate (PbWO sub 4), a widely known scintillating material, gives TL glow peaks which are related to complex defect centres. Doping of this crystal with trivalent rare earth ions (La sup 3 sup +, Y sup 3 sup +) reduces the slow component of the emission thereby making it more suitable for its applications. The pentavalent dopants on the other hand, enhance the green emission and quench the blue emission at temperatures 100 K. The origin and the irradiation temperature definitely {{have an effect on the}} spectrum. No strong relationship could be derived from the dose dependence data. Two less studied minerals, Spodumene and Topaz have also been investigated with the luminescence techniques. The glow peak near 250 degC is thought to have originated from Mn sup 2 sup + centres. As there are no ESR data available, the <b>assignment</b> of defect <b>centres</b> is rather difficult. Cr sup + acts as the quencher in green spodumene. Topaz had the same treatment as the other two sets of samples and the defect centre characterisation looks complex as each coloured sample gave different patterns of glow peaks. Cathodoluminescence whilst heating (CLTL) of all these samples showed some unusual features in the form of a luminescence intensity step which is believed to have originated from the presence of ice. Water, in nanoparticle size quantities, is present as a contaminant in the lattice and undergoes a phase transition at 170 K from hexagonal to cubic structures. This phase change influences the luminescence efficiency of the host material and is reflected in the spectrum as a discontinuity in intensity...|$|R
40|$|Clustering {{problems}} are well-studied {{in a variety}} of fields such as data science, operations research, and computer science. Such problems include variants of centre location problems, k-median, and k-means to name a few. In some cases, not all data points need to be clustered; some may be discarded for various reasons. We study clustering problems with outliers. More specifically, we look at Uncapacitated Facility Location (UFL), k-Median, and k-Means. In UFL with outliers, we have to open some centres, discard up to z points of X and assign every other point to the nearest open centre, minimizing the total <b>assignment</b> cost plus <b>centre</b> opening costs. In k-Median and k-Means, we have to open up to k centres but there are no opening costs. In k-Means, the cost of assigning j to i is δ^ 2 (j,i). We present several results. Our main focus is on cases where δ is a doubling metric or is the shortest path metrics of graphs from a minor-closed family of graphs. For uniform-cost UFL with outliers on such metrics we show that a multiswap simple local search heuristic yields a PTAS. With a bit more work, we extend this to bicriteria approximations for the k-Median and k-Means problems in the same metrics where, for any constant ϵ > 0, we can find a solution using (1 +ϵ) k centres whose cost is at most a (1 +ϵ) -factor of the optimum and uses at most z outliers. We also show that natural local search heuristics that do not violate the number of clusters and outliers for k-Median (or k-Means) will have unbounded gap even in Euclidean metrics. Furthermore, we show how our analysis can be extended to general metrics for k-Means with outliers to obtain a (25 +ϵ, 1 +ϵ) bicriteria...|$|R
40|$|The master’s thesis problematizes the {{question}} of moving children and adolescents from foster families to residential treatment institutions. Foster care should be a solution for children and adolescents who are from various reasons unable to live in their original family. Foster families are in certain cases incapable of fulfilling its educational function which enables the child’s development. In these instances residential treatment institutions take over child’s wellbeing and education, which means transferring the child or adolescent into an institution. The main goal of the thesis was to research how professionals from the mentioned field, {{deal with the issue}} of transferring children and adolescents from foster homes to residential treatment centres. The theoretical part defines the primary social group of every individual – family and its main tasks. For easier understanding of the transition from the original family to a foster family and the transition from a foster family to a residential treatment institution, the terms functional and dysfunctional family are further explained. It is followed by the definition of a foster family and foster care and conditions under which it can take place, based on the legal basis of the mentioned area. Roles and assignments of a foster parent and placement of a child or adolescent into foster family are defined by it. Then we move on to the roles and <b>assignments</b> of <b>centres</b> for social work in regard to placement of children and adolescents into foster homes or residential treatment institutions. The theoretical part is concluded by presentation of residential treatment institutions and a list of main reasons why somebody should be placed into them. Empirical part uses descriptive and causal non-experimental research method and qualitative research approach. I analysed the transition of children or adolescents from foster homes to residential treatment institutions with the help of partially structured interviews from the viewpoint of three professionals employed at the centres for social work and three nursery school teachers employed in residential treatment institutions. Research proved that there are different factors regarding each individual case when placing children or adolescents from foster homes to residential treatment institutions. According to statements from experts who participated in the research, we can divide them into factors that originate from the child or adolescent, factors that originate in the foster family and factors of mutual connection. Research shows that problems arise mostly from partial insufficiencies of the legal statues regarding placement into a foster family, badly educated foster parents from the area of emotional and behavioural troubles of children or adolescents and due to insufficient number of professionals employed at centres for social work. Key solution for the mentioned problem is cooperation of all experts together. Research shows that age of the child or adolescent at the time of placement, influences the type of their placement. ...|$|R
40|$|The Open University of Sri Lanka (OUSL) is a {{specifically}} created, academically autonomous national {{university in the}} country. The OUSL academic structure consists of four faculties which serve the nation with distant education programmes through Regional and Study Centers. A major component of the distance learning programmes in the OUSL context is furnishing the students with the home assignments. The students have the facility to submit their home <b>assignments</b> to a <b>centre</b> convenient to them which are then sent to the relevant Course Coordinators who bear the responsibility to mark the assignments and send {{them back to the}} students. When this process is done manually all parties involved are faced with certain difficulties. As a result, students are unable to get their eligibility for the final examination and are penalized in numerous ways. With the intention of overcoming these obstacles and to streamline the process of handling submission of assignments as hard copies, I have implemented an Online Home Assignment Management System. The most obvious and significant advantages offered by Online Home Assignment Management System are that it prevents misplacement of assignments, offers faster assignment marks entering mechanisms, and provides quick message delivering methods regarding assignment events. The main users of this system are Receiving Officer, Course Coordinator and students. But the main role is played by Course Coordinators and Receiving officers. In this system Receiving Officers have been provided with a facility to accept the assignments from the students till the due date of assignment and to generate a letter to be sent with the assignments to the relevant Course Coordinator with the details of the assignments. After posting these assignment parcels, Receiving Officer sends required details to the relevant Course Coordinator along with postal registration number through the system. When receiving the assignments, Course Coordinator can view and check all the details pertaining to the assignments in the system. Further this system makes the role of the Course Coordinator easier and effective in preparing mark sheets. Finally, it is believed that the system developed provide many options to all the users to get their work done accurately and effectively...|$|R
40|$|Defects have a {{dramatic}} effect on the properties of semiconductors. In SiC, intrinsic defects can be introduced during growth or device-processing steps such as implantation. In this work electron irradiation {{has been used for}} the controlled generation of defects in SiC. The irradiated material has been annealed and subsequent low temperature photoluminescence (LTPL) measurements have been performed. A key element in this work has been the ability to perform both the irradiation and characterisation on a microscopic scale. These results have allowed a variety of new optical centres to be discovered, and have also significantly enhanced the pool of knowledge about other defect centres. Utilising low voltage irradiations has enabled the electron irradiation voltage displacement thresholds for Carbon and Silicon displacements to be investigated. In 4 H-SiC the electron irradiation voltage displacement thresholds were found to be 88 kV for C displacement and 225 kV for Si displacement. A large number of previously unreported luminescence features have been measured in 4 H, 6 H and 15 R-SiC material. The criteria used for comparison are the voltage threshold, annealing characteristics, spatial distribution with respect to the irradiated region, and the characteristics of associated local modes and vibronic structures. Compelling evidence has been found to support the <b>assignment</b> of <b>centres</b> in 4 H and 6 H-SiC to a C-C dumbbell split interstitial defect. Two high energy local modes at 133 meV and 180 meV are associated with these centres. In " 1 " 3 C enriched 6 H-SiC material the 180 meV local mode splits into three components whilst the 133 meV local mode splits into two components. This splitting is interpreted as being caused by isotopic substitutions between the components of the C-C dumbbell. The high energy local mode corresponds to the bonding between the two constituent atoms of the dumbbell whilst the low energy local mode is associated with the bonding between either a C" 1 " 3 or " 1 " 2 C atom with the nearest Si atom. A new centre that is common to 4 H, 6 H and 15 R-SiC has been investigated. The dominant component of this centre is measured at 673 nm, 764 nm and 766 nm in 4 H, 6 H and 15 R-SiC respectively and are collectively known as the B 1 centre. The centres exhibit an intermediate irradiation voltage threshold value that is approximately mid-way between the threshold associated with the generation of isolated C and Si vacancies. It is likely that a C-Si dumbbell split interstitial complex would be generated at these voltages and {{this is consistent with the}} two-fold splitting exhibited by all components of the B 1 centre in " 1 " 3 C 6 H-SiC material. Equivalent features to the alphabet lines in 4 H-SiC and the neutral silicon vacancy (V_S_i" 0) related features in 4 H and 6 H-SiC have been investigated in 4 H, 6 H and 15 R-SiC polytypes. The 'equivalent' alphabet lines exhibit virtually identical characteristics in all polytypes that are consistent with the proposed isoelectronic natures of the defect centres. Considerable spectral variety was found in the energy range associated with the V_S_i" 0 luminescence with the intermittent appearance of additional features attributed to regions with a high density of stacking faults. It has been proposed that remnant electric Fields, perturbations to the Fermi level and intrinsic stress are responsible for the spatial variations in the energy and intensity exhibited by some centres.

40|$|The {{objectives}} are to review results and experiences from interdisciplinary research projects in Research Centre for the Management of Animal Production and Health (CEPROS) concerning scientific content, organisation, and collaboration. The Centre {{has been founded}} {{as a result of}} an agreement between four institutions: the Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences (DIAS), the Danish Veterinary Laboratory (DVL), the Danish Veterinary Institute for Virus Research (DVIV) and The Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University (KVL). CEPROS is a "research centre without walls" and is physically located as an integrated part of the four institutions named above. The Centre has close collaboration with the industry. The superior goals of the Centre are to co-ordinate fundamental and applied research and simultaneously integrate the veterinary and the production oriented livestock research within animal health and welfare, taking into consideration the production economics and reduced use of medication. The <b>assignment</b> of the <b>Centre</b> is to initiate and carry out research, aiming to investigate the influence of breeding and production systems on animal health and welfare as well as on production and product quality. The Centre has since 1997 established 16 interdisciplinary research projects dealing with cattle, pigs, poultry, or mink. The scientific content can be divided into three research clusters: A. Management of animal production and health in production systems, B: Pathogenesis of production diseases, and C. Animal health economics. In Cluster A, the physical environments of production systems have been investigated, broader definitions of the concept health have been established and used in identification of risk factors. Cluster B has investigated physiological, immunological and genetic mechanisms behind development of production diseases and how to apply this knowledge in disease prevention. The cluster in animal health economics has developed decision support tools for disease control in swine and cattle herds. The interdisciplinary research groups organised in a centre without walls are found very useful for dealing with complex issues. The initial phases in the projects may be long as it takes time for different researchers to define common goals and identify methods. The individual researcher must get some insight in other disciplines without loosing his/her own area of expertise. In order to reach a synthesis of the different parts of a project, it is important that the project is well organised and there is participation of researchers with both specialised insight and researchers with a more broad insight in the problems. It is also important that the integration process is balanced, and not too many research disciplines are included in the same project. </p...|$|R
40|$|Gd-doped fluorapatite, {{synthesized}} from CaF 2 -rich melts, {{has been}} investigated as single crystals and powder samples by using X-band (9. 5 GHz) and W-band (95 GHz) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Gd 203 with natural abundances of isotopes and 157 Gd-enriched Gd 203 {{were used in the}} crystal synthesis. The X-band spectra obtained for the Gd-doped fluorapatite displayed a well-resolved type of Gd 3 + centre (the centre 'a') caused by the Gd even isotopes (electron spin: S = 7 / 2; nuclear spin: I = 0), and suggested the possible presence of a second partly-resolved type of Gd 3 + centre (the centre 'b') also caused by the Gd even isotopes. The latter was thoroughly disclosed in the W-band spectra. The single-crystal X- and W- band EPR spectra from three orthogonal rotation planes obtained from the Gd-doped fluorapatite allowed determination of the general spin-hamiltonian parameters for Gd 3 + centres 'a' and 'b', including the spin terms of type BS (g matrix) and S 2 (D matrix), and the parameters associated with the high-spin terms of type S 4 and S 6, as well as BS 3 and BS 5. The validity of the spin-hamiltonian parameters was confirmed by agreement between the observed and simulated EPR spectra for both single-crystal and powder samples. The principal values of the matrices g and D for the centres 'a' and 'b' indicate that the two Gd 3 +-occupied sites in the synthetic fluorapatite have rhombic local symmetry. The principal directions of the D matrices suggest that the centres 'a' and 'b' correspond to substitutions of Gd 3 + into Ca 2 and Cal sites, respectively. These site assignments are supported by the results of pseudo-symmetry analyses using the S 4 parameters. For example, the calculated pseudo-symmetry axes of the centre 'a' coincide with the local rotoinversion axis, site coordinations, as well as the faces of the coordination polyhedra of the Ca 2 sites. The local structural environments of the centres 'a' and 'b' also suggest that the Gd 3 + ions are incorporated into the Ca 2 and Cal via Gd 3 + + 02 - &#x 2194; Ca 2 + +F- and 2 Gd 3 + + &# 9633; &#x 2194; 3 Ca 2 +, respectively. The vacancy (&# 9633; ) associated the centre 'b' {{has been shown to be}} located at a nearest-neighbor Ca 2 site, resulting in a Gd 3 + [...] &# 9633; [...] -Gd 3 + arrangement, with the cations well separated. The single-crystal X- and W-band EPR spectra of the 157 Gd-doped fluorapatite revealed a well-resolved 157 Gd (nuclear spin: I= 3 / 2) hyperfine structure (HFS) of the centre 'a' and a partly-resolved 157 Gd HFS of the centre 'b'. The calculated spin-hamiltonian parameters for the hyperfine, nuclear quadrupole, and nuclear Zeeman effects (i. e., matrices A,P and gn) provide further evidence for the site <b>assignment</b> of the <b>centres</b> 'a' to 157 Gd nuclides at the Ca 2 sites, with rhombic local symmetry. The P matrix also suggests that the electric-field gradient at the 157 Gd nuclides of the centre 'a' is close to uniaxial, with the largest value along the direction of the Ca 2 - 02 bond and almost isotropic in the horizontal plane. Moreover, single-crystal spectrum simulations have shown that the hyperfine anisotropy of the centre 'a' arises not only from A, P and gn but is also affected by terms BS (g), S 2 (D), S 4, S 6, BS 3 and BS 5...|$|R
40|$|Diamond is a radiation-hard {{material}} {{with a wide}} band-gap which is typically electrically insulating. A wide range of diamond-based material is available, including natural gemstones and synthetic diamondmanufactured by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and {{high pressure and temperature}} (HPHT) techniques. The wide band-gap and electrical insulation properties mean that defects introduced by irradiation and plastic deformation, during growth or otherwise, may exist in more than one charge and/or electronic-spin state. Of these, defects with unpaired electrons give rise to characteristic spectroscopic signatures in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments. In favourable situations these spectra provide chemical specificity, defect symmetry, effective spin-state, and wave function character (such as sp hybridisation), and when combined with temperature effects can yield data relating to thermal stability (for example binding and migration energies) and temperature dependent symmetry effects. Recent advances in quantum chemical simulation allow for reasonable accuracy in simulated hyperfine interaction (HFI) tensors (electron-spin and nuclear-spin interactions). Indeed, many <b>assignments</b> for EPR <b>centres</b> are tentative in nature. Where the proposed model yields calculated hyperfine values that differ substantially from those measured, in addition to refuting the current model, an examination {{of a wide range of}} candidate defects may lead to more realistic models. Defects observed in natural and synthetic diamonds provide a finger-print of their differing growth conditions, as well as the thermal and mechanical processes they have experienced. A challenge that has existed for decades in the effort to produce diamond suitable for electronics is in overcoming the difficulty in production of low resistivity n-type material. N, a dopant one might naively assume would be effective, undergoes a significant structural relaxation, rendering it a very deep donor at around Ec − 1. 7 eV. Phosphorus is a better candidate since the substantial difference in atomic radius relative to the host suppresses large structural relaxations associated with nitrogen. However, with a donor level at around 0. 6 eV below the conduction band, it has a low ionisation fraction at room temperature. This thesis presents the results of calculations performed with the ab initio modelling (AIMPRO) code. The initial stages studied the stability, defect symmetry, Kohn Sham orbitals and the hyperfine interaction of di-nitrogen substitutionals diamond. Analysis was then conducted of nitrogen pair defects relating to published theoretical and experimental models of W 24, N 1, W 7, M 2, N 4 and M 3 electron-paramagnetic-resonance centres in diamond in which pairs of nitrogen donors are separated by different numbers of intervening host sites, both in ionised S = 1 / 2 and neutral S = 1 forms. Using density functional techniques, these models are confirmed, but in order to do so for the N 4 centre, for example, it is shown to be essential that extremely low energy reorientation takes place. Charge exchange and chemical re-bonding effects also provide an explanation for the distinct forms of the S = 1 neutral configurations observed. Other proposed models were then considered, including a detailed analysis of the hyperfine interactions formuoniumcentres, including the effects of vibration. This was combined with the experimental examination of N-containing diamond, where muon-spin relaxation experiments suggest a strong interaction between N-aggregates and the implanted muon. Structures made from two arrangements of pairs of substitutional nitrogen and oxygen showed no direct evidence for the involvement of the oxygen. The proposed model for N 3 broadly agreed with experimental results but not for the OK 1 centre. Despite its high ionisation energy, the n-type dopant of choice in diamond is currently phosphorus. Chemical vapour deposited diamond can be grown with high concentrations of P, and the substitutional donor has been characterised via a number of experimental techniques including electron paramagnetic resonance. Substitutional P undergoes a Jahn-Teller distortion at low temperature, where the EPR tensors reflect a tetragonal symmetry. Other P-containing EPR centres have also been detected but their structure remains uncertain. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
