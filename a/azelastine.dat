Allergy immonotherapy (AIT) treatment involves administering doses of allergens to accustom the body to induce specific long-term tolerance. Allergy immunotherapy can be administered orally (as sublingual tablets or sublingual drops), or by injections under the skin (subcutaneous).

5000|$|The area of {{intranasal}} medication delivery {{provides a}} huge opportunity for research - both for specifically developed pharmaceutical drugs designed for intranasal treatment, {{as well as}} for investigating off label uses of commonly available generic medications. Nasal sprays for local effect are quite common. Steroids, antiasthma medications such as salbutamol, ipratropium, montelukast and a large number of inhalational anaesthetic agents are being used commonly. The recent developments in intranasal drug delivery systems are prodigious. Several antimigraine drugs, available by the trade names of Imitrex- sumatriptan; Zomig - Zolmitriptan; Migranal - Dihydroergotamine and the OTC nasal spray Sinol-M; are also currently administered by nasal administration because a fast effect is desired and oral administration can be prohibited by nausea. Peptide drugs (hormone treatments) are also available as nasal sprays, in this case to avoid drug degradation after oral administration. The peptide analogue desmopressin is, for example, available for both nasal and oral administration, for the treatment of diabetes insipidus. The bioavailability of the commercial tablet is 0.1% while that of the nasal spray is 3-5% according to the SPC (Summary of Product Characteristics). Syntocinon nasal spray containing oxytocin is used to increase duration and strength of contractions during labour. Intranasal oxytocin is also being actively investigated for many psychiatric conditions including alcohol withdrawal, anorexia nervosa, PTSD, autism, anxiety disorders, pain sensation and schizophrenia. Intranasal Calcitonin, calcitonin-salmon is used to treat Hypercalcaemia arising out of malignancy, Paget's disease of bone, post menopausal and steroid induced osteoporosis, Phantom limb pain and other metabolic bone abnormalities, available as Rockbone, Fortical and Miacalcin Nasal Spray. GnRH analogues like nafarelin and busurelin are used for the treatment of anovulatory infertility, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, delayed puberty and cryptorchidism. Other potential drug candidates for nasal administration include anaesthetics, antihistamines (<b>Azelastine),</b> antiemetics (particularly metoclopramide and ondansetron) and sedatives that all benefit from a fast onset of effect. Intranasal midazolam is found to be highly effective in acute episodes of seizures in children. Recently, {{the upper part of the}} nasal cavity, as high as the cribriform plate, has been proposed for drug delivery to the brain. This [...] "transcribrial route" [...] published first in 2014 was suggested by the author (Baig AM. et al,) for drugs to be given for Primary Meningoencephalitis [...] Naloxone is used intravenously in opiate addiction in emergency cases, in rapid opiate detoxification, and as a diagnostic tool. The nasal drug administration of naloxone was found to be as effective as the intravenous route. In opioid overdoses, where hypotension and sometimes damaged veins make intravenous administration difficult, nasal naloxone offers a wide margin of safety and reduced risk of infection from vessel puncture while enabling even untrained bystanders to assist a victim. The prevention of abnormal nasal blood vessel growth (Avastin) and even the delivery of medications and drug antidotes such as hydroxocobalamin (antidote to cyanide poisoning) are being developed via intranasal medications. More recently interest is developing on delivery of a number of peptides and other drugs to the nose for direct transport into the brain to treat neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's. Intranasal insulin is being investigated for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. IN ketamine, commonly being used for the treatment of breakthrough pain in patients with chronic pain is now becoming an area of significant research interest for the treatment of bipolar disease and major depressive disorder with early results suggesting a strong and prolonged antidepressant effect following a single subdissociative dose (50 mg) of ketamine.|$|E

40|$|<b>Azelastine,</b> a new oral {{agent with}} {{antiallergic}} and antihistamine properties, {{has been shown}} to inhibit the effect of histamine and leukotriene (LT) in vitro, though not a specific leukotriene receptor antagonist. The effect of both a single dose (8. 8 mg) and 14 days' treatment (8. 8 mg twice daily) with <b>azelastine</b> on bronchoconstriction induced by LTC 4 and histamine has been examined in 10 patients with mild asthma in a placebo controlled, double blind, crossover study. LTC 4 and histamine were inhaled in doubling concentrations from a dosimeter and the results expressed as the cumulative dose (PD) producing a 20 % fall in FEV 1 (PD 20 FEV 1) and 35 % fall in specific airways conductance (PD 35 sGaw). The single dose of <b>azelastine</b> produced a significantly greater FEV 1 and sGaw values than placebo at 3 hours, but this bronchodilator effect was not present after 14 days of treatment. <b>Azelastine</b> was an effective H 1 antagonist; after a single dose and 14 days' treatment with placebo the geometric mean PD 20 FEV 1 histamine values (mumol) were 0. 52 (95 % confidence interval 0. 14 - 1. 83) and 0. 54 (0. 12 - 2. 38), compared with 22. 9 (11. 5 - 38. 3) and 15. 2 (6. 47 - 35. 6) after <b>azelastine</b> (p less than 0. 01 for both).
