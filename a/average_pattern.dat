30|$|This paper extends {{previous}} {{models of}} sequence memory [7, 9, 11, 12] that {{were based on}} Willshaw’s learning rule [10] to inhomogeneous pattern sizes, i.e., patterns of variable sparseness. Our work reveals that inhomogeneity in the sparseness of stored patterns is detrimental to a recurrent network’s dynamic stability during sequence retrieval. Bigger than <b>average</b> <b>patterns</b> tend to lead the network into an all-active epileptic state {{as a result of}} an excessively high synaptic drive, whereas smaller than <b>average</b> <b>patterns</b> tend to lead to an all-silent state {{as a result of an}} insufficient synaptic drive. In either case, sequence retrieval is terminated prematurely due to dynamic instability. As expected, the higher the variability in pattern sizes, the higher is the probability of premature sequence termination. Our results thus suggest that a plasticity mechanism that ensures a certain degree of homogeneity in the sparseness of hippocampal representations would be useful for the reliable retrieval of long sequences.|$|R

40|$|Climate change {{introduces}} numerous uncertainties {{over the}} livelihoods of farming communities that depend heavily on weather and climate. Rain-fed farmers {{in developing countries}} {{are among the most}} vulnerable communities. However, climate risks are not new to farmers. Coping with ‘natural variability’ of climate has been a constant challenge faced by farmers even though broad sweeping change in climate due to anthropogenic causes is a relatively new prospect. Some argue ‘climate change’ could be significantly different from ‘climatic variability’ known to and experienced by farmers. In spite of this it is widely accepted that understanding farmers’ behavior towards adapting to climatic variability could generate useful insights in facing the risk of climate change. In Sri Lanka, the village tank farming community in the dry zone {{is one of the most}} vulnerable communities thereby deserving the priority attention of policy makers. This study is based on information gathered in Anuradhapura district of Sri Lanka. It depends mainly on information from secondary sources supplemented by qualitative primary information. Analysis was guided by recently introduced behavioral economics concepts of decisions based on experience. Accordingly adaptation is viewed as a response to the climate perceptions of farmers' aided by judgments based on heuristics. Farmers' adaptation decisions can be explained on the basis of their perception of climate variability with two major components. Firstly, farmers perceive climatic variability as an average annual pattern with variable probabilities of seasonal distribution of precipitation. Farmers base their long-term adaptation responses on this perceived <b>average</b> <b>pattern</b> and many of the choices made by them in the existing farming system and resource management practices can be explained accordingly. The <b>average</b> <b>pattern</b> of variability is largely a shared perception and therefore enables the option of joint adaptation. The land allocation practice popularly known as ‘Bethma’ provides a fine example for this. Secondly, farmers also perceive feasibility of random shocks with variable probabilities across the <b>average</b> <b>pattern.</b> This gives rise to short-term responses in the farming system activities. Such responses seem to be more individually oriented and reflect the variations in individual perceptions of climate risks.

This effect is problematic for biological visual systems, in which stereopsis is based on simple, short-range mechanisms. It is argued here that the problem should be addressed in two ways; firstly by an appropriate representation of disparity, and secondly by modelling the typical pattern of image correspondences. It is shown that the average spatial structure of the disparity field can be estimated, over a series of binocular fixations. An algorithm based on this idea is tested on natural images. Finally, it is shown how the <b>average</b> <b>pattern</b> of disparities could help to put the images into binocular correspondence. ...|$|E
