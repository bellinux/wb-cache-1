5|$|Muhammad Yunus was {{inspired}} during the Bangladesh famine of 1974 {{to make a}} small loan of US$27 to a group of 42 families as start-up money so that they could make items for sale, without the burdens of high interest under predatory lending. Yunus believed that making such loans <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> larger population could stimulate businesses and reduce the widespread rural poverty in Bangladesh.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} of Starling's public disgrace, Lecter sends her a taunting letter. Starling detects a strange fragrance from the letter. A perfume expert later identifies a skin cream whose ingredients are only <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> few {{shops in the}} world. She contacts the police departments of the cities where the shops are located, requesting surveillance tapes. In Florence, one of said cities, Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi is investigating the disappearance of a library curator.

In 2003, the government introduced a sweeping health reform programme aimed at increasing the ratio of private to state health provision and making healthcare <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> larger share of the population. Turkish Statistical Institute announced that 76.3 billion TL was spent for healthcare in 2012; 79.6 percent of which was covered by the Social Security Institution and 15.4 percent of which was paid directly by the patients. In 2012, there were 29,960 medical institutions in Turkey, and on average one doctor per 583 people and 2.65 beds per 1000 people.|$|E

Boston's climate plan is updated every three years and was most recently modified in 2013. This legislature includes the Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance, which requires the city's larger buildings to disclose their yearly energy and water use statistics and partake in an energy assessment every five years. These statistics are made public by the city, thereby increasing incentives for buildings to be more environmentally conscious.|$|E
5|$|The {{account of}} Southchurch's {{provisioning}} was first made <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wider audience through {{the writings of}} the English historian Helen Cam. Cam was responsible for groundbreaking work on the Hundred Rolls, and their relevance to English local government, through her Studies in the Hundred Rolls (1921) and The Hundred and the Hundred Rolls (1930). In both of these she made mention of what she calls '...the most picturesque series of extortions recorded in the Essex returns.' It was, however, in a paper published in the English Historical Review as early as 1916 that she gave the most detailed account of Southchurch's plot. Here she traced the dissemination of the Viking legend through Geoffrey of Monmouth, and speculated that Southchurch could have been acquainted with a later version by Gaimar, Wace or Layamon, or through a local, popular legend.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{court in}} Bergen also started {{importing}} and translating the first true European literature that became <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wider Norwegian audience. The literature which was popular then was heroic-romantic literature {{derived from the}} French and in turn English courts, notably chansons de geste around Charlemagne (the Matter of France) and tales of King Arthur (the Matter of Britain). The first work that was translated into Old Norse was reportedly the Arthurian romantic story Tristan and Iseult, which was finished in 1226 after orders from the young and newly-wed Haakon. Hákon's programme {{seems to have been}} the spark for {{the emergence of a new}} Norse genre of chivalric sagas.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{was designed to}} study the feasibility of an external degree program among the member institutions of the Michigan Council of State College Presidents (MCSCP). Data were collected concerning the specific undergraduate and graduate noncampus, evening and Saturday activities available for credit during 1971 - 72 and analyzed by frequency and percentage distribution. Results indicated that the combined offering of all MCSCP institutions could constitute a degree program. The findings are categorized by feasibility of an external degree program and implementation of an external degree program.

5|$|The sale {{catalogue}} doesn't mention any maps but it {{is known}} that the family sold the copper plates to Jodocus Hondius in 1604. He transformed the atlas. Almost 40 extra maps were added (including Spain and Portugal) and in 1606 a new edition appeared under his name but with full acknowledgement that most maps were created by Mercator. The title page now included a picture of Hondius and Mercator together although they had never met. Hondius was an accomplished business man and under his guidance the Atlas was an enormous success; he (followed by his son Henricus, and son-in-law Johannes Janssonius) produced 29 editions between 1609 and 1641, including one in English. In addition they published the atlas in a compact form, the Atlas Minor, which meant that it was readily <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wide market. As the editions progressed, Mercator's theological comments and his map commentaries disappeared from the atlas and images of King Atlas were replaced by the Titan Atlas. By the final edition the number of his maps in the atlas declined to less than 50 as updated new maps were added. Eventually the atlas became out-of-date and {{by the middle of the}} seventeenth century the publications of map-makers such as Joan Blaeu and Frederik de Wit took over.|$|E

40|$|A {{person whose}} privacy has been infringed upon through the unlawful, {{culpable}} processing {{of his or}} her personal information can sue the infringer's employer based on vicarious liability or institute action based on the Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013 (POPI). Section 99 (1) of POPI provides a person (a "data subject") whose privacy has been infringed upon with the right <b>to</b> institute <b>a</b> civil action against the responsible party. POPI defines the responsible party as the person who determines the purpose of and means for the processing of the personal information of data subjects. Although POPI does not equate <b>a</b> responsible party <b>to</b> <b>an</b> employer, the term "responsible party" is undoubtedly a synonym for "employer" in this context. By holding an employer accountable for its employees' unlawful processing of a data subject's personal information, POPI creates a form of statutory vicarious liability. Since the defences <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> employer at common law and developed by case law differ from the statutory defences <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> employer in terms of POPI, it is necessary to compare the impact this new statute has on employers. From a risk perspective, employers must be aware of the serious implications of POPI. The question that arises is whether the Act perhaps takes matters too far. This article takes a critical look at the statutory defences <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> employer in vindication of a vicarious liability action brought by a data subject in terms of section 99 (1) of POPI. It compares the defences found in section 99 (2) of POPI and the common-law defences <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> employer fending off a delictual claim founded on the doctrine of vicarious liability. To support the argument that the statutory vicarious liability created by POPI is too harsh, the defences contained in section 99 (2) of POPI are further analogised with those <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> employer in terms of section 60 (4) of the Employment Equity Act 55 of 1998 (EEA) and other comparable foreign data protection statutes...|$|R
