5|$|Significant {{settlement}} {{appears to}} have begun in the Mesolithic era, with Star Carr in North Yorkshire generally considered the most significant monument of this era. The Star Carr site includes Britain's oldest known house, from around 9000 BC, and the earliest evidence of carpentry {{in the form of}} <b>a</b> <b>carved</b> tree trunk from 11000 BC.|$|E
5|$|A large table tomb at {{the west}} end of the churchyard is listed {{separately}} by English Heritage as a GradeII-listed structure. Dating from about 1800, it contains the remains of George and Mary Hutchinson.

The Grade II listing was given on 23February 1983.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though it}} was {{subordinate}} to Vale Royal Abbey, the church at Llanbadarn Fawr remained important in its own right. The building was actually substantially extended in 1475, {{with the construction of}} a large new sanctuary. There was also a Rood screen and loft, with <b>a</b> <b>carved</b> image of Christ crucified, with the figures of Mary and St John either side, though this is now gone, although the steps to the loft may still be seen to {{the north side of the}} chancel.|$|E
5|$|Northern triptychs and polyptychs {{were popular}} across Europe {{from the late}} 14th century, with the peak of demand lasting until the early 16th century. During the 15th century, {{they were the most}} widely {{produced}} format of northern panel painting. Preoccupied with religious subject matter, they come in two broad types: smaller, portable private devotional works, or larger altarpieces for liturgical settings. The earliest northern examples are compound works incorporating engraving and painting, usually with two painted wings that could be folded over <b>a</b> <b>carved</b> central corpus.|$|E
5|$|Roskilde Convent is on {{the site}} of the former St Catherine's Priory from the mid-13th century which belonged to the Dominican friars until it was {{dissolved}} after the Danish Reformation. A private manor house (Sortebrødregaard or Blackfriars Manor) was built on the site in 1565 which in 1699 became a convent for women of high rank, the first of its kind in Lutheran Denmark. The building now houses a collection of 150 paintings from the 16th to 18th centuries as well as period furniture. The convent chapel has <b>a</b> <b>carved</b> altarpiece and pulpit.|$|E

5|$|The Gothic Revival {{church is}} in the Early English style. It is built from rubble masonry dressed with {{limestone}} and has a slate roof. The vestry is partially built from material used in the old church. The door in the vestry's north wall has medieval doorjambs, and the keystone of the pointed arch, which is also medieval, is <b>a</b> <b>carved</b> human face.|$|E
5|$|The chapel {{beneath its}} large onion dome {{is dark and}} {{cavernous}} and decorated with carved giltwood, the detailing highlighted in red, green, blue and pink, by the Portuguese sculptor Silvestre Faria Lobo. The upper level has galleries {{for the use of}} royal personages who would sit apart from the congregation. One of these galleries contains a small Rococo pipe organ. A feature of the chapel is the ornate portable font, its marble basin resting in an elaborate Rococo frame surmounted by <b>a</b> <b>carved</b> wood cover.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle section}} of the column, forming a type of capital, is a high-relief {{sculpture}} {{of the head of}} a bat executed in the curved lines of the Maya style, with small eyes and eyebrows formed by two small volutes. The leaf-shaped nose is characteristic of the Common Vampire Bat (Desmodus rotundus). The mouth is open, exposing the partly preserved fangs, and a prominent tongue extends downwards. A band of double triangles runs around the sculpture with <b>a</b> <b>carved</b> cord or rope and may symbolise the bat's wings.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} {{rooms on}} both ground and first floors feature oak panelling; {{that in one}} of the upper rear rooms is Elizabethan. This room also features a fine carved overmantel with a woven love knot and central heart; the ground floor room {{to the right of the}} hall contains a further good example of <b>a</b> <b>carved</b> overmantel. One of the rooms has panels decorated with intersecting triangles.|$|E
5|$|The pulpit {{has some}} 19th-century oak {{panelling}} and reuses some ornate 17th-century panel {{work that is}} decorated with pictures of cherubs, dragons, dogs and lions' heads. The pews are made of pine; the choir stalls also have some carved oak panels that may date from the 17th century. A reading desk from the 19th century reuses material from the 14th and 17th centuries, depicting a lion, a griffin and angels. The church also has an eight-sided sandstone font decorated with <b>a</b> <b>carved</b> cross.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{elaborate}} carved stone battle-axes found in East Lothian, Aberdenshire and Lanarkshire. These show little sign of use or wear, and so, {{rather than being}} practical objects, may be symbolic representations of power. Similarly, the site at Forteviot, in Perthshire, produced a unique warrior burial under a giant sandstone slab. The slab is engraved with a spiral and has an axehead pecked into the underside, and underneath there are grave goods of a copper dagger with leather scabbard and <b>a</b> <b>carved</b> wooden bowl.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two other}} {{historic}} churches in central Roskilde. St Ib's is located below the cathedral plateau near the harbour. Built in travertine around 1100, the Romanesque building was once richly decorated in frescos, remains {{of which can be}} seen on the rear wall. It is no longer a functioning church. St Jørgensbjerg Church stands on a little hill to the northwest of the old town, overlooking the fjord. With a nave and chancel in travertine dating from c. 1080, it is Denmark's oldest preserved stone building. It features <b>a</b> <b>carved</b> pulput from 1616.|$|E
5|$|A stuccoed brick {{fence with}} cast iron gates and an iron Star of David enclose the cemetery. Within the walls, {{there are two}} main {{pathways}} which meet {{in the center of the}} cemetery at a circular decorative piece including a fountain. The oldest graves are in the northern half of the cemetery while newer graves were added progressively south. Many grave sites are adorned with well-maintained Victorian era funerary art, which gives the cemetery its historic significance. Among the monuments include the grave enclosure of the Winner family, which includes a bronze bust of Mark Winner, and two marble angels at the entrance of the plot. Other examples include the grave of David L. Rosenbaum, topped with marble shoes and stockings, the grave of Julius Elson, marked by <b>a</b> <b>carved</b> marble fainting couch, and a memorial to Mattimore Meyer, featuring a marble angel.|$|E
5|$|Charles II criticised Bruce's initial {{plans for}} the {{internal}} layout, and an improved scheme was eventually approved. Construction began in July 1671, and by 1674 {{much of the work}} was complete. Bruce built a second gothic tower to mirror the existing one built by James V between 1528 and 1532, and created the courtyard block in a restrained classical style. A second phase of work started in 1676, when the Duke of Lauderdale ordered Bruce to demolish and rebuild the main west façade, resulting by 1679 in the screen wall, topped by <b>a</b> <b>carved</b> imperial crown, which forms the main entrance.|$|E
