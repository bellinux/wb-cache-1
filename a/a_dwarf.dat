5|$|Ceres (2.77AU) is {{the largest}} asteroid, a protoplanet, and <b>a</b> <b>dwarf</b> planet. It has a {{diameter}} of slightly under 1,000km, and a mass large enough for its own gravity to pull it into a spherical shape. Ceres was considered a planet when it was discovered in 1801, and was reclassified to asteroid in the 1850s as further observations revealed additional asteroids. It was classified as <b>a</b> <b>dwarf</b> planet in 2006 when {{the definition of a}} planet was created.|$|E
5|$|Haumea, minor-planet {{designation}} 136108 Haumea, is <b>a</b> <b>dwarf</b> planet located beyond Neptune's orbit. It {{was discovered}} in 2004 by a team headed by Mike Brown of Caltech at the Palomar Observatory in the United States and independently in 2005, by a team headed by José Luis Ortiz Moreno at the Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain, though the latter claim has been contested. On September 17, 2008, it was recognized as <b>a</b> <b>dwarf</b> planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) and named after Haumea, the Hawaiian goddess of childbirth.|$|E

5|$|Findings {{from the}} Dawn {{spacecraft}} have {{found evidence that}} the troughs that wrap around Vesta could be graben formed by impact-induced faulting (see Troughs section above), meaning that Vesta has more complex geology than other asteroids. Vesta could have been classified as <b>a</b> <b>dwarf</b> planet if it had retained a spherical shape, and it has other qualities {{that lead to the}} thought it could be a protoplanet. The only thing that knocked it out of the category of <b>a</b> <b>dwarf</b> planet was the formation of two large impact basins at its southern pole. At the time of these impacts Vesta was not warm and plastic enough to return to a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Haumea (43.13AU average) is in {{an orbit}} similar to Makemake except {{that it is in}} a 7:12 orbital {{resonance}} with Neptune. It is about the same size as Makemake and has two natural satellites. A rapid, 3.9-hour rotation gives it a flattened and elongated shape. It was named and designated <b>a</b> <b>dwarf</b> planet in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Haumea is a plutoid, <b>a</b> <b>dwarf</b> planet beyond Neptune's orbit. It is {{classified}} as <b>a</b> <b>dwarf</b> planet because it is presumed to be massive enough to have been rounded by its own gravity into a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium, but not massive enough to have cleared its neighbourhood of similarly sized objects. Haumea was initially listed as a classical Kuiper belt object in 2006 by the Minor Planet Center, but no longer. The nominal trajectory suggests that Haumea is in a weak 7:12 orbital resonance with Neptune, {{which would make it}} a resonant object instead. Although there are precovery images of Haumea dating back to March 22, 1955 from the Palomar Mountain Digitized Sky Survey, further observations of the orbit will be required to verify its dynamic status.|$|E

5|$|In a draft {{resolution}} for the IAU definition of planet, both Pluto and Charon {{would have been}} considered dwarf planets in a binary system, given that they both satisfied the mass and shape requirements for dwarf planets and revolved around a common center of mass located between the two bodies (rather than within one of the bodies). The IAU currently states that Charon is not considered to be <b>a</b> <b>dwarf</b> planet and is just a satellite of Pluto, although the idea that Charon might qualify to be <b>a</b> <b>dwarf</b> planet in its own right may be considered at a later date. The location of the barycenter depends not only on the relative masses of the bodies, but also on the distance between them; the barycenter of the Sun–Jupiter orbit, for example, lies outside the Sun.|$|E
5|$|In {{the poem}} Alvíssmál, Thor tricks <b>a</b> <b>dwarf,</b> Alvíss, to his doom upon finding that {{he seeks to}} wed his {{daughter}} (unnamed, possibly Þrúðr). As the poem starts, Thor meets <b>a</b> <b>dwarf</b> who talks about getting married. Thor finds the dwarf repulsive and, apparently, realizes that the bride is his daughter. Thor comments that the wedding agreement was made among the gods while Thor was gone, and that the dwarf must seek his consent. To do so, Thor says, Alvíss must tell him {{what he wants to}} know about all of the worlds that the dwarf has visited. In a long question and answer session, Alvíss does exactly that; he describes natural features as they are known in the languages of various races of beings in the world, and gives an amount of cosmological lore.|$|E
5|$|Juno was {{originally}} considered a planet, along with 1 Ceres, 2 Pallas, and 4 Vesta. In 1811, Schröter estimated Juno {{to be as}} large as 2290km in diameter. All four were reclassified as asteroids as additional asteroids were discovered. Juno's small size and irregular shape preclude it from being designated <b>a</b> <b>dwarf</b> planet.|$|E

5|$|Makemake (minor-planet {{designation}} 136472 Makemake) is <b>a</b> <b>dwarf</b> {{planet and}} perhaps the largest Kuiper belt object in the classical population, with a diameter approximately two thirds that of Pluto. Makemake has one known satellite, S/2015 (136472) 1. Makemake's extremely low average temperature, about , means its surface is covered with methane, ethane, and possibly nitrogen ices.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>dwarf</b> {{planet is}} a planetary-mass object that {{is neither a}} planet nor a natural satellite. That is, it is in direct orbit of a star, and is massive enough for its gravity to crush it into a hydrostatically equilibrious shape (usually a spheroid), but has not cleared the {{neighborhood}} of other material around its orbit.|$|E
5|$|Compression of <b>a</b> white <b>dwarf</b> will {{increase}} the number of electrons in a given volume. Applying the Pauli exclusion principle, this {{will increase}} the kinetic energy of the electrons, thereby increasing the pressure. This electron degeneracy pressure supports <b>a</b> white <b>dwarf</b> against gravitational collapse. The pressure depends only on density and not on temperature. Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; this means that the density of <b>a</b> high-mass white <b>dwarf</b> is much greater than that of <b>a</b> low-mass white <b>dwarf</b> and that the radius of <b>a</b> white <b>dwarf</b> decreases as its mass increases.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{in detail the}} generation of a "truth" spectrum of HR 6348, using observations with the Short-Low (SL) module of the Infrared Spectrograph of HR 6348, and the <b>A</b> <b>dwarfs</b> alpha Lac and delta UMi. Using spectral ratios, we can propagate Kurucz models of the <b>A</b> <b>dwarfs</b> to the K giant HR 6348, which can then serve to calibrate the remaining database of SL spectra. Mitigation {{in the vicinity of}} the Pfund-a line is necessary to reduce residual artifacts at 7. 45 um. In general, the new SL spectrum of HR 6348 has a spectroscopic fidelity of ~ 0. 5 % or better. Artifacts from the hydrogen recombination lines in the <b>A</b> <b>dwarfs</b> will generally be smaller than this limit, although the residual artifact from the blend of lines near Pfund-alpha exceeds the limit at ~ 0. 7 %.
