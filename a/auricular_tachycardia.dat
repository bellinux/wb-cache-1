40|$|Abnormal foci in the auricles, {{from which}} the cardiac impulse may arise, beget various types of arrhythmia. Three main groups may be distinguished, namely, ectopic beats, {{auricular}} tachy-cardia (of slower or faster rate), and auricular fibrillation. Although the deranged auricular function is fundamentally similar in each variety, there are reasons for regarding the groups as separate nosological entities; the etiology, clinical presentation, prognosis, and response to treat-ment differ, justifying the preservation of this clinical classification. The benign nature of extrasystoles and of most instances of <b>auricular</b> <b>tachycardia</b> is known, and the more serious prognosis connected with some instances of <b>auricular</b> <b>tachycardia</b> and with auricular fibrillation {{is related to the}} underlying heart disease. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe a syndrome that was found in four patients all of whom exhibited an arrhythmia different in form and course from the common varieties. Having regard to the serious prognosis identified with this condition the term malignant auricular arrhythmia is proposed for it. CASE HISTORIES Case 1.

40|$|T HE {{observations}} t,o {{be described}} in this paper were made in con- nection with a study of <b>auricular</b> paroxysmal <b>tachycardia.</b> It {{is well known that}} quinidine frequently slows the cardiac rate in <b>auricular</b> paroxysmal <b>tachycardia,</b> and sometimes stops the paroxysm. The same effects may be produced by quinine, and the actions of these two drugs are, no doubt, similar.

40|$|INTEREST in {{congenital}} cardiac {{disease has}} stimulated many reports deal-ing with the anatomic, physiologic and clinical aspects of anomalies of the heart. Disturbances in cardiac rhythm and conduction {{in association with}} congenital cardiac disease comprise an important but less commonly recorded finding in congenital cardiac disease. Complete heart block {{is probably the most}} commonly recorded conduction disturbance observed in association with congenital cardiac disease. This ectopic rhythm is most often observed in association with congenital ventricular septal defects. Auricular fibril-lation has been observed by Taussig * to occur frequently in association with defects of the atrial septum. This anomaly may also be associated with paroxysmal <b>tachycardia,</b> <b>auricular</b> flutter and complete heart block. Dry 2 has recently recorded a case of paroxysmal tachycardia with an atrial septal defect, in which death was presumably the result of the ectopic rhythm.

40|$|In {{the first}} paper {{of this series}} (1) were {{reported}} observations {{on the effect of}} irregular <b>tachycardia</b> (<b>auricular</b> fibrillation) on the blood flow in dogs. It was found that the blood flow was decreased during this mechanism. Observations on the effect of regular tachycardia form the subject of this paper. The operative procedure used in the preparation of the dogs and the method of investigation were described in the preceding paper. Briefly, wire electrodes were sutured to the righi auricles. The opera-tions were performed with sterile precautions. The dogs were an-esthetized with ether given by the intratracheal method. After the dogs recovered from the preliminary operation the heart was stimu-lated through these electrodes and the effect of the induced rhythm on the blood flow was studied. The regular tachycardias were induced by means of single induced break shocks thrown into the auricle at a regular rapid rate, which could be varied as desired. We have used rates between 250 and 400 per minute. The apparatus (fig. 1) which we used to obtain these stimuli was essentially the same as that used by Cohn and Levy (2) in studying the effect of qulnidine sulphate on the refractory period of the heart muscle in dogs. Only break shocks were used, the make shocks being short-circuited. The induced current was obtained from two dry cell batteries inserted in the primary circuit of a Du Bois-Reymond induction coil. The rate of the induced shocks was recorded by the shadow of the string of a second galvanometer on the same photographic film on which the electrocardiogram was photographed. An electromagnetic signal was placed in, the primary circuit and indicated on the film when th...|$|R
40|$|An {{abnormal}} auricular {{activity is}} produced by faradization of the right auricle of the dog, which frequently becomes established and continues for varying periods of time after faradization is discontinued. This auricular activity consists of a rapid <b>auricular</b> <b>tachycardia</b> coexisting with true auricular fibrillation. In some dogs the auricles are thrown into this abnormal activity more readily by faradization after the vagi have been cut than before. Cutting the nerves {{has little or no}} effect on the abnormal auricular activity, but the ventricular rate may be much increased if the vagi are cut after the abnormal auricular activity has been established, apparently because of an improvement in the auriculoventricular conductivity. Stimulation of the right vagus nerve changes the character of the activity of the faradized auricles by inhibiting the <b>auricular</b> <b>tachycardia</b> while the fibrillation is uninfluenced. Stimulation of the left vagus nerve has little or no apparent inhibitory effect on the <b>auricular</b> <b>tachycardia,</b> but has possibly an inhibitory effect on the auricular fibrillation. Vagus stimulation increases the susceptibility of the auricles to faradization. The abnormal activity set up by faradization may be established in hearts otherwise refractory by vagus stimulation of short duration following the faradization. Vagus stimulation usually holds the auricles in the abnormal activity set up by faradization {{as long as it is}} continued in hearts in which, without vagus stimulation, the sequential beat always returns as soon as faradization is stopped. The right vagus is more effectual in this respect than the left. In some hearts vagus stimulation alone is capable of initiating the same abnormal auricular activity which is caused by auricular faradization. The normal sequential beat is often restored by vagus stimulation. It replaces the abnormal auricular activity not during, but a few seconds after, the termination of vagus stimulation. Left vagus stimulation is somewhat more effectual in producing this result than right vagus stimulation...|$|E
40|$|T H E {{effects of}} carotid sinus {{hypersensitivity}} on the cardio-vascular sys-tem are well known. 1 ' 2 Most {{of the case}} records are concerned with patients who had a basic normal sinus rhythm whereas {{only a limited number}} of re-ports could be found wherein carotid sinus hypersensitivity was associated with cardiac arrhythmia. Weiss and Baker * reported one case with auricu-lar fibrillation (in this patient carotid sinus stimulation produced only slight slowing of the ventricular rate) and Hiatt and Adams 3 published the record of one patient with auricular flutter. A survey of the literature failed to reveal the association of paroxysmal tachycardia and carotid sinus hyper-sensitivity. Recently the opportunity was presented to observe four instances of carotid sinus hypersensitivity, each occurring in a different cardiac rhythm, viz: regular sinus rhythm, paroxysmal <b>auricular</b> <b>tachycardia,</b> auricular fibril-lation and auricular flutter. It is interesting to note that these four cases were first seen at the New York Post-Graduate Hospital within a period o...|$|E
40|$|AURICULAR flutter is an {{arrhythmia}} {{well known}} as an electrocardio-graphic entity. It is most often discovered upon study of patients with very rapid heart action, especially in rheumatic cardiacs and thyrocardiacs, and in patients with recent myocardial infarction. The electrocardiographic characteristics and the physiologic features of auricular flutter are described in all general medical texts, 1 but the clinical features are only briefly re-ferred to even in the cardiology texts. 3 It is generally indicated, particu-larly in the American literature, that flutter lies between auricular tachy-cardia and auricular fibrillation in duration, incidence of organic heart dis-ease, and rapidity of auricular rate. Friedberg, 3 d for example, points out that flutter has a greater tendency than <b>auricular</b> <b>tachycardia</b> to persist, but he refers to cases of long standing as rarities in the literature. In a similar vein, White 3 b states that auricular flutter lasts for minutes, days, or weeks, but rarely for months or years. He, too, refers to several patients with flutter of many years ' duration as unusual cases in the literature. Lewis...|$|E
40|$|In 1888, Bristowe {{wrote of}} " Recurrent {{palpitations}} of extreme rapidity in persons otherwise healthy "; he was, however, extremely guarded {{as to the}} correct prognosis in this condition, seeing that six out of nine of the cases he described died before their time. Similarly, {{two of the three}} cases recorded by Bouveret (1889) died of congestive failure during an actual paroxysm. Indeed the early reports are characterized by the number of fatal cases, so that it is not surprising to find Herringham (1897) writing " when one sees a robust and healthy person subject to these attacks, it is tempting to make light of them, but this ought never to be done. The condition seems always to tend to get worse and, in the end, to kill. " We do not in our generation take such a gloomy view of the attacks, but even now {{it is not uncommon to}} find patients, who are otherwise organically sound, living a life of a cardiac cripple following the pronouncement of a poor prognosis.

40|$|ALTHOUGH earlier writers, 1 * 2 » 3 had {{discussed}} the syndrome of short P-R intervals and widened QRS complexes, proper clinical {{evaluation of the}} problem was not accomplished until the paper of Wolff, Parkinson, and White, 4 by whose names the syndrome is frequently known. These earlier papers referred to the relative frequency of associated paroxysmal <b>auricular</b> <b>tachycardia</b> or auricular fibrillation. Recently interest has been renewed in the syndrome because of its occurrence with paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia. The first report apparently was that of Arana and Cossio in 1938, 5 whose patient had episodes of auricular fibrillation and paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia associated with this syndrome. In 1940 Hunter, Papp, and Parkinson 6 described two patients in whom the syndrome occurred with paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia; one of the patients subse-quently developed a supraventricular tachycardia, the other auricular fibrillation. Three additional cases of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia were described by Levine and Beeson 7 in 1941. A more recent report by Palatucci and Knighton 8 describes a similar case. Many of the above writers comment on the difficulty of excluding recent myocardial in-farction in some of these patients. The patient herein described represents another example of paroxysmal ven-tricular tachycardia associated with short R-R intervals and wide QRS com-plexes. Certain features of this case would seem to justify the addition of another report to the literature.

40|$|The tumultuous {{auricular}} activity {{which follows}} faradization of the auricles of mammals {{and which has}} been variously described, could be distinctly seen to consist almost constantly in our experiments on dogs of true fibrillatory movements of the separate muscle fibers coëxisting with a rapid <b>auricular</b> <b>tachycardia.</b> During peripheral stimulation of the right vagus nerve the true fibrillation alone existed, the tachycardia being inhibited. A comparison of the electrocardiograms from dogs with this abnormal auricular activity with those from patients {{with the type of}} cardiac arhythmia which has been attributed to auricular fibrillation, and from patients with so called auricular flutter, indicates that the auricular activity in patients with either of these conditions differs somewhat from that usually seen in the faradized auricles of the dog in our experiments. The auricular activity of the cases of cardiac arhythmia is apparently true fibrillation, similar to that seen in the faradized auricles of the dog during right vagus stimulation. The electrocardiograms from cases of so called auricular flutter usually give no evidence of auricular fibrillation, and the auricular activity seems to consist of tachycardia alone. Fibrillation may apparently coëxist with the tachycardia in some cases, when the auricular activity seems to resemble closely that usually seen in the dog after auricular faradization. During peripheral stimulation of the left vagus nerve, the electrocardiograms obtained after auricular faradization show changes which render them more nearly similar to those obtained from patients with auricular flutter. The facts that the auricular activity of the faradized auricles of the dog may apparently pass spontaneously into that closely resembling auricular flutter in man, that it may be changed into true fibrillation by right vagus stimulation, and that the abnormal auricular activity in man passes from a state of flutter to that of fibrillation in a similar manner, may be taken as evidence for the belief that auricular fibrillation and auricular flutter in man are closely allied cardiac disorders...|$|E

The auricular escaped beats continued on the following ventricular were occasionally experienced at the recovery into normal sinus rhythm from paroxysmal auricular tachycardia; at this moment the esophageal lead revealed well the nature of P. c. So-called reciprocal rhythm was seen in one case with a-v dissociation. Esophageal lead enabled easily to identify auricular complex of orthodirectional or reciprocal nature; shape and intrinsicoid deflection were distinctly different from each other, but the directions of the auricular complexes did not always appear reversely. d. In one case with posterior infarction complicated by complete a-v block, the routine 12 leads did not strikingly show P waves, whereas by means of esophageal lead which was performed cautiously enabled to recognize the distinct P wave, therefore the interauricular dissociation was excluded with any difficulties. e. Esophageal leads of 9 cases with auricular fibrillation were studied at 9 times. In 2 of 9 cases f wave were seen more easily in V_ 1 than in esophageal lead, in 6 of all in the latter than in the former. f.
