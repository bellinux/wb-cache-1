The neck and supraclavicular fossa are palpated to feel for cervical <b>adenopathy,</b> other masses, and laryngeal crepitus. The oral cavity and oropharynx are examined under direct vision. The larynx may be examined by indirect laryngoscopy using a small angled mirror with a long handle (akin to a dentist's mirror) and a strong light. Indirect laryngoscopy can be highly effective, but requires skill and practice for consistent results. For this reason, many specialist clinics now use fibre-optic nasal endoscopy where a thin and flexible endoscope, inserted through the nostril, is used to clearly visualise the entire pharynx and larynx. Nasal endoscopy is a quick and easy procedure performed in clinic. Local anaesthetic spray may be used.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Chronic granulomatous disease {{associated}} with common variable immunodeficiency (GD-CVID), although well documented, is rare. Granulomatous lesions can affect several organs and are histologically indistinguishable from sarcoidosis. CLINICAL CASES: Case 1 : A 39 -year-old male patient with CVID, asymptomatic although with thrombocytopenia and mediastinal-hilar <b>adenopathies.</b> GD-CVID was diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy. Progressive clinical and radiological improvement was obtained with corticotherapy. Case 2 : A 38 -year-old male patient with CVID, suffered from asthenia, anorexia, myalgia, lower limbs edemas, and dry cough. He had mediastinal and bilateral hilar <b>adenopathies</b> within which biopsy revealed non-necrotizing granulomatous infiltrate. A spontaneous resolution was detected after 9 months of evolution. CONCLUSION: GD-CVID is rare and can mimetize other pathologies, namely, sarcoidosis; it {{should therefore be}} publicized and discussed so that it becomes a general clinical knowledge...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium malmoense is a nontuberculous {{mycobacteria}} seen {{mainly in}} two age groups and with different clinical presentations. Most patients are male adults presenting clinical symptoms and signs {{similar to those}} of pulmonary tuberculosis. The second group is formed by immunocompetent children with localized cervical lymphadenitis. Although cervical adenitis is the main extrapulmonary manifestation of M. malmoense, virtually all cases of cervical disease were documented in children. Disseminated disease is rare and has been reported in patients with severely impaired immunity. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 47 -year-old immunocompetent man with a cervical abscess, in whom we identified a M. malmoense pulmonary disease with multiple cervical, thoracic and abdominal <b>adenopathies.</b> CONCLUSION: Extrapulmonary infection due to M. Malmoense needs to be considered on the differential diagnosis of cervical masses and <b>adenopathies,</b> not only in pediatric patients but also in adults with no impaired immunity. A high index of suspicion for nontuberculous mycobacteria is essential for the diagnosis and prognosis...|$|R
5000|$|Lymphadenopathy or <b>adenopathy</b> is {{disease of}} the lymph nodes, {{in which they are}} {{abnormal}} in size, number, or consistency.

In clinical practice, the distinction between lymphadenopathy and lymphadenitis is rarely made and the words are usually treated as synonymous. Inflammation of the lymphatic vessels is known as lymphangitis. Infectious lymphadenitides affecting lymph nodes in the neck are often called scrofula.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) {{for assessment}} of treatment response in {{head and neck}} squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) {{three weeks after the}} end of chemoradiotherapy (CRT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-nine patients with HNSCC underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prior to and 3 weeks after CRT, including T(2) -weighted and pre- and postcontrast T(1) -weighted sequences and an echo-planar DWI sequence with six b values (0 to 1, 000 s/mm(2)), from which the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was calculated. ADC changes 3 weeks posttreatment compared to baseline (∆ADC) between responding and nonresponding primary lesions and <b>adenopathies</b> were correlated with 2 years locoregional control and compared with a Mann-Whitney test. In a blinded manner, the ∆ADC was compared to conventional MRI 3 weeks post-CRT and the routinely implemented CT, on average 3 months post-CRT, which used size-related and morphological criteria. Positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) were compared between the ∆ADC and anatomical imaging. RESULTS: The ∆ADC of lesions with later tumor recurrence was significantly lower than lesions with complete remission for both primary lesions (- 2. 3 % ± 0. 3 % vs. 80 % ± 41 %; p < 0. 0001) and <b>adenopathies</b> (19. 9 % ± 32 % vs. 63 % ± 36 %; p = 0. 003). The ∆ADC showed a PPV of 89 % and an NPV of 100 % for primary lesions and a PPV of 70 % and an NPV of 96 % for <b>adenopathies</b> per neck side. DWI improved PPV and NPV compared to anatomical imaging. CONCLUSION: DWI with the ∆ADC 3 weeks after concluding CRT for HNSCC allows for early assessment of treatment response. status: publishe...|$|R

SVC has been observed as a result of diffuse mediastinal lymphadenopathy of various pathologies such as cystic fibrosis [...] and Castleman’s disease.

This occurs when adult M. perstans invades the conjunctiva or periorbital connective tissues in the eye. M. perstans can also present with hydrocele in South America.
