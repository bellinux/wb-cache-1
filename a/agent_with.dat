40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} models used {{to embody}} intelligent agents {{are becoming increasingly}} realistic. We discuss two studies in which we embodied intelligently behaving virtual <b>agents</b> <b>with</b> photographically realistic models of human subjects' heads and faces. We then immersed those subjects <b>with</b> <b>agents</b> embodied <b>with</b> their virtual selves and compared their interactions and nonverbal behaviors to separate subjects who were immersed <b>with</b> <b>agents</b> embodied <b>with</b> virtual others. Subjects treated <b>agents</b> embodied <b>with</b> their virtual selves fundamentally differently than <b>agents</b> embodied <b>with</b> virtual others in regards to both measured nonverbal behaviors and questionnaire ratings.

40|$|We {{develop a}} model {{with money and}} credit where agents have {{different}} productivity to study credit and allocation. We show {{the link between the}} credit rationing, productivity and monetary policy, and study the distributional effects of monetary policy on the credit constraints, money holdings, and the ability to trade across agents. An agent’s productivity reflects his ability to replenish the money holdings and the ability to repay loans. We find that <b>agents</b> <b>with</b> low productivity consume less, produce more, and have less gains from trade in the good market. The cost of being excluded from the banking system is small for <b>agents</b> <b>with</b> low productivity, so banks offer less credit to <b>agents</b> <b>with</b> low productivity when credit rationing occurs. The monetary policy does not affect the effectiveness of credit arrangement in an equilibrium with unconstrained credit. In an equilibrium with constrained credit, inflation has different effects across heterogeneous agents. The borrowing constraints of <b>agents</b> <b>with</b> high productivity is relaxed more than those with low productivity. Hence, while inflation increases, the welfare of <b>agents</b> <b>with</b> high productivity is also higher...|$|R

40|$|Abstract To {{investigate}} whether {{the theory of}} evolutionary ethics is a valid explanation {{for the existence of}} ethical behaviour, we approach the ethical issues of morality from a computational point-of-view. We define a model of multi-agent societies, in which agents are able to evolve a moral sense. In the model, moral sense is defined by every agent’s personal set of rules, which determines its interaction <b>with</b> other <b>agents.</b> By performing simulations of the model we investigate under what circumstances the agents in the societies develop a moral sense which allows the society to thrive. We use four conceptually different <b>agent</b> designs: <b>agents</b> <b>with</b> a minimum of attributes, <b>agents</b> <b>with</b> family relations, <b>agents</b> <b>with</b> a memory, and <b>agents</b> <b>with</b> reputation in the society. From our results we conclude that there are circumstances under which agents evolve ethical behaviour, those circumstances being specific settings of family relations and reputation...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{substitution}} of piperacillin/tazobactam, ampicillin/sulbactam, or both for third-generation cephalosporins {{has been associated}} with reduced vancomycinresistant enterococci (VRE). However, piperacillin/tazobactam came into widespread use during a period in which the prevalence of VRE increased. We hypothesized that the increasing use of piperacillin/tazobactam and other <b>agents</b> <b>with</b> relatively enhanced anti-enterococcal activity (ie, piperacillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, and ampicillin) {{has been associated with}} increased or unchanged rates of VRE in some hospitals. DESIGN: We retrospectively evaluated the correlation between hospital antibiotic use (defined daily doses per 10, 000 patient-days of care) and incidence of stool or non-stool VRE isolation. We assessed whether a high or increasing proportion of use of beta-lactam <b>agents</b> <b>with</b> relatively enhanced versus minimal (ie, third-generation cephalosporins and ticarcillin/clavulanate) antienterococcal activity would prevent increased VRE. SETTING: Four academic medical centers. RESULTS: With the increasing use of piperacillin/tazobactam, the use of beta-lactam <b>agents</b> <b>with</b> enhanced activity against enterococci surpassed the combined use of third-generation cephalosporins and ticarcillin/clavulanate in each hospital. In one hospital, the incidence of VRE was positively correlated with the use of piperacillin/tazobactam or beta-lactam <b>agents</b> <b>with</b> enhanced antienterococcal activity (P <. 0001). The incidence of VRE rose steadily in another hospital despite relatively high use of beta-lactam <b>agents</b> <b>with</b> enhanced versus minimal anti-enterococcal activity. A negative correlation between VRE and piperacillin/tazobactam or beta-lactam <b>agents</b> <b>with</b> enhanced anti-enterococcal activity was observed in one hospital, but this correlation was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Increasing the hospital use of piperacillin/ tazobactam and other beta-lactams with relatively enhanced anti-enterococcal activity may not be an effective control measure for VRE (Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol...|$|R
