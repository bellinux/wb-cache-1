40|$|Seventy-five {{years after}} its {{enactment}} the Investment <b>Advisers</b> Act of 1940 has advanced from a relatively weak statute merely registering <b>advisers</b> with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to a more robust law imposing fiduciary responsibilities on <b>advisers.</b> Over the years, the number of investment <b>advisers</b> {{and the number of}} their clients have increased greatly. The SEC therefore has been pressured by Congress to develop a harmonized fiduciary standard for broker-dealers and <b>advisers</b> and also to develop and enforce a greater degree of oversight over the advisory industry. These developments have raised the questions of how to fund such efforts and whether <b>advisers</b> should organize a self-regulatory organization. In the meantime, the Department of Labor adopted a fiduciary standard that will impact many broker-dealers and investment <b>advisers.</b> Further, the SEC has beefed up its examinations program for <b>advisers</b> and has become more aggressive in its enforcement of cases against <b>advisers...</b>|$|R

5|$|Enrollment dropped {{every year}} since the program's {{inception}} such that, when compounded by dropouts, the program was below half-capacity three years later. UW President Glenn Frank had warned of decreased enrollment in August 1928 and of its consequences for the college. UW College of Letters and Science Dean George Sellery offered support conditional on codified discipline and uniform final exams, which Meiklejohn refused. Sellery later refused to allow transfer students into the college. Meiklejohn wrote letters to Wisconsin high schools in April 1929 that acknowledged the college's stereotypes and welcomed demographic change, but the campaign backfired. He sent an <b>adviser</b> to tour the state and solve {{what he saw as}} a communication issue. The <b>adviser</b> found high school seniors largely interested in vocational training, and that the prospect of traditional college excited students {{to the point where they}} did not consider improvements upon that model.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the Executive has fundamentally {{changed in the last}} 30 years. Ministerial <b>advisers</b> have become major institutional actors within the Executive, interposed between Ministers and public servants. The number of ministerial <b>advisers</b> has expanded exponentially, and they exercise increasingly strong influence within the Executive. There has been a shift of the locus of power from public servants to ministerial <b>advisers.</b> Ministerial <b>advisers</b> are now a permanent and durable part of the Executive. Ministerial <b>advisers</b> are increasingly involved in scandals that appear {{on the front page of}} the newspapers. Compared to the strict hierarchy of the public service that creates predictable outcomes, ministerial offices operate like a primordial soup, in a fluid and unconstrained manner, with ministerial <b>advisers</b> taking up roles and responsibilities on an ad hoc basis with limited regulation. This thesis argues that this is a symptom of broader systemic failure, rather than failings at an individual level. This thesis utilises an empirical and doctrinal methodology to analyse the legal and political accountability of ministerial <b>advisers</b> within the Australian framework of responsible government. It is posited that constitutional and administrative law are not the best avenues to enhance the accountability of ministerial <b>advisers.</b> Although ministerial <b>advisers</b> post-date the Constitution, this thesis shows that the appropriation of the salaries of ministerial <b>advisers</b> is constitutional. Administrative law is an effective avenue of redress for individuals aggrieved by the actions of ministerial <b>advisers,</b> but only covers a small proportion of their actions. Thus, administrative law provides only a partial method of enhancing the accountability of ministerial <b>advisers.</b> This thesis argues that the most effective resolution of this issue lies at the parliamentary level. It is primarily through parliamentary committees that ministerial <b>advisers</b> and Ministers can be properly held to account. This thesis shows that, contrary to the assertions of former Prime Minister John Howard and former Victorian Attorney-General Rob Hulls, there is no constitutional convention at the Commonwealth and Victorian levels that ministerial <b>advisers</b> do not appear before parliamentary committees. It is argued that responsible government means that ministerial <b>advisers</b> should appear before parliamentary committees where it facilitates the accountability of Ministers...|$|R
