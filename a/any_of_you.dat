[...] The est trainer {{explains}} that the course techniques are used because [...] "Werner {{has found that the}}y work."

500|$|Swift did {{not want}} any misconceptions of Beautiful Eyes as her second album and {{therefore}} partnered with the American retail company Wal-Mart to make the EP an exclusive release. The album was only made available through American Wal-Mart stores and Wal-Mart's website. Furthermore, it was made a limited release because Swift only allowed Big Machine Records to manufacture {{a certain number of}} copies of the EP. She said, [...] "I’m only letting my record company make a small amount of these. The last thing I want <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> to think is that we are putting out too many releases." ...|$|E
500|$|Robinson's {{promotion}} met {{a generally}} positive, although mixed, reception among newspapers and white major league players. However, racial tension {{existed in the}} Dodger clubhouse. Some Dodger players insinuated they would sit out rather than play alongside Robinson. The brewing mutiny ended when Dodgers management took a stand for Robinson. Manager Leo Durocher informed the team, [...] "I do not care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a fuckin' zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays.

500|$|The {{video is}} similar to the director's cut, but has a few differences. The choreography cut offers lengthier shots of Spears and her dancers, and much of the apocalypse storyline is edited out. The clip's ending is also {{different}} from the original: instead of emerging from the manhole Spears just looks into the camera, apparently still hiding in the underground party and hinting at a darker ending in which the world does end. On April 9, 2011, Spears tweeted that she had seen the final cut of the dance version, and was not sure which one she liked best. Ray Kay tweeted on April 14, 2011, that the original version of the video was better, [...] "but it's fun to watch the choreography too." [...] The video, titled [...] "DANCE Till the World Ends" [...] premiered on April 15, 2011. Leah Collins of Dose commented, [...] "sorry, Team Britney, but if <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> were hoping to pass off Spears’ anemic performance in the original as the result of unfortunate editing, this clip isn’t exactly going to bring anyone back on side." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 1878, the MCC {{rejected}} Wills' last overture to the club, and his dwindling {{income from}} cricket was [...] "finally asphyxiated". From February 1879 onwards, {{he lived with}} Barbor in Heidelberg, a small village {{on the margins of}} Melbourne. Wills made only two trips outside of Heidelberg for the remainder of his life; on one of these, in January 1880, he was sighted at the MCG during an intercolonial between Victoria and New South Wales. His alcoholism worsened over this period, as did Barbor's, also a heavy drinker. Occasionally he coached the Heidelberg Cricket Club, and, on 13 March 1880, played for the side against a [...] "travelling circus" [...] of bohemians in his last recorded game. Wills took five wickets, his [...] "chucks" [...] working [...] "sweetly" [...] on the rough pitch. In his last surviving letters, sent two days later to his brothers on Cullin-la-ringo, he wrote that he was [...] "out of the world" [...] in Heidelberg, and fantasised about escaping to Tasmania. Begging for money to help pay off debts, he promised, [...] "I will not trouble <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> again".|$|E
500|$|As {{subsequent}} Conciliation Bills were introduced, WSPU leaders {{advocated a}} halt to militant tactics. In March 1912 the second bill was in jeopardy and Pankhurst joined a fresh outbreak of window-smashing. Extensive property damage led police to raid the WSPU offices. Pankhurst and Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence were tried at the Old Bailey and convicted of conspiracy to commit property damage. Christabel, who by 1912 was the chief coordinator for the organisation, was also wanted by police. She fled to Paris, where she directed WSPU strategy in exile. Inside Holloway Prison Emmeline Pankhurst staged her first hunger strike to improve conditions for other suffragettes in nearby cells; she was quickly joined by Pethick-Lawrence and other WSPU members. She described in her autobiography the trauma caused by force-feeding during the strike: [...] "Holloway became a place of horror and torment. Sickening scenes of violence took place almost every hour of the day, as the doctors went from cell to cell performing their hideous office." [...] When prison officials tried to enter her cell, Pankhurst raised a clay jug {{over her head and}} announced: [...] "If <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> dares so much as to take one step inside this cell I shall defend myself." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{official}} The Office website {{included three}} cut scenes from [...] "Golden Ticket". One 72-second clip includes Michael eavesdropping from the men's bathroom on Angela, Oscar, Kelly and Meredith, who discuss how unfair Michael is treating Dwight in making him take the fall over the failed golden ticket promotion. Kelly {{also makes the}} remark, [...] "I hope Dwight gets fired and they get a hot new guy to replace him," [...] to which Oscar replies, [...] "Seriously." [...] In another 52-second scene, Michael asks Dwight {{to go on a}} stroll, but Dwight suggests turning it into a [...] "power stroll", which he prepares Michael for by applying sunscreen to his face. And in a follow-up to the scene where workers discuss that Michael should be fired, a visibly angry and upset Michael confronts the office. When he says [...] "Can <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> imagine this office without me?" [...] everyone gleefully raises their hands, but Michael then asks them if they've thought about what kind of terrible person they could get to replace him; he then pointedly says that they could get someone who knows they don't actually need three accountants (Oscar, Kevin, and Angela look visibly ashamed that Michael knew this going back to Season 2's Halloween episode but has never taken any action about it) or someone who doesn't approve of romantic relationships and would transfer one or both people having one to separate branches (Jim and Pam in turn get this message and look thoughtful), and tells the office that they should mind what they're saying about him [...] "when I'm hiding in the bathroom pretending to be pooping." ...|$|E
