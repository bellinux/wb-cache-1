Kongu Nadu cuisine does not involve marination of any raw material and as a result the food has a different taste and unique texture.

5000|$|The Hebrew word used {{to denote}} this incense is מור = [...] "mōr." [...] Maimonides, {{following}} a lead by Rabbi Saadia Gaon, believed this incense {{to have been}} musk (Moschus moschiferus), the <b>aromatic</b> <b>substance</b> which exudes from a gland on the male musk deer. From ancient times down to our present time, an incense has been made from it. Still, {{with respect to the}} Holy Incense, musk is largely thought of today as being an erroneous designation. Nahmanides (RAMBAN), in his commentary on Exodus 30:23, gives plausible arguments why the [...] "mōr" [...] in the Holy Incense can only be the gum resin myrrh (Commiphora myrrha, syn. Balsamodendrum myrrha) rather than the musk absolute. While quoting from the Midrash Rabba, he notes that the [...] "mōr" [...] is said to emit its fragrant odor only when put to heat, whereas the musk absolute already has a sweet odor before it is put to the fire. He quotes also from an early rabbinic source which says that [...] "mōr," [...] when it clings to vessels, serves as an interposing object between the water and the vessel, preventing its valid immersion in a ritual bath (Heb. miqwah). RAMBAN notes that this can only apply to the gum resin myrrh, which is sticky, but NOT to musk absolute taken from the musk deer.|$|E

40|$|Soils and decayed plant litter contain {{significant}} {{quantities of}} chlorinated aromatic polymers {{that have a}} natural but largely unknown origin. We used cupric oxide ligninolysis coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to show that Curvularia inaequalis, a widely distributed litter ascomycete, chlorinated the aromatic rings of lignin in wood that it was degrading. In aspen wood decayed for 24 weeks, two chlorolignin fragments, 5 -chlorovanillin and 2 -chlorosyringaldehyde, were each found at ≈ 10 μg/g of wood (dry weight). These levels resemble those of similar structures generally found in unpolluted environmental samples. Fractionation of the extractable proteins followed by tandem mass spectrometric analysis showed that the colonized wood contained a previously described C. inaequalis chloroperoxidase that very likely catalyzed lignin chlorination. Chlorolignin produced by this route and humus derived from it are probably significant components of the global chlorine cycle because chloroperoxidase-producing fungi are ubiquitous in decaying lignocellulose and lignin is the earth's most abundant <b>aromatic</b> <b>substance...</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceOrchid {{bees are}} an {{important}} group of specialized insect pollinators in the Neotropics. Male orchid bees are attracted by {{a wide range of}} <b>aromatic</b> <b>substances</b> often produced by flowers. Previous studies found that in some species the males change their aromatic preferences between seasons. In our study we documented seasonal changes of aromatic preferences in five euglossine bee assemblages along a 380 -km-long seasonality and precipitation gradient and related them to climatic factors. We found that the proportion of species per site showing changes in their aromatic preference between seasons increased with climatic seasonality towards the south. Those species mainly belong to the genus Euglossa, subgenus Euglossa. We conclude that climatic seasonality mainly affects the orchid bees via the turnover of the <b>aromatic</b> <b>substances</b> provided by the plants. Further, we suggest that the ability to change the aromatic preference between seasons could be interpreted as a phylogenetic pre-adaptation that enabled some species to colonize climatically strongly seasonal habitats...|$|R
5000|$|Musk is a {{class of}} <b>aromatic</b> <b>substances</b> {{commonly}} used as base notes in perfumery.

The substance {{has been used as}} a popular perfume fixative since ancient times and is one of the most expensive animal products in the world. The name originates from the Late Greek μόσχος 'moskhos', from Persian 'mushk', from Sanskrit 'muska-s' [...] "testicle", from Latin 'mus' [...] "mouse" [...] (so called, presumably, for resemblance; see muscle). The deer gland was thought to resemble a scrotum.

Both enzymes also cleaved this dimer to give 1 -chloro- 4 -ethoxy- 3 -methoxybenzene and 1, 2 -dichloro- 4 -ethoxy- 5 -methoxybenzene, and they depolymerized a synthetic guaiacyl lignin. Since fungal CPOs occur in soils and the fungi that produce them are common inhabitants of plant debris, CPOs may have roles in the natural production of high-molecular-weight chloroaromatics and in lignin breakdown.

40|$|The {{contamination}} of soils by petroleum hydrocarbons, such as diesel fuel, has since many years been a serious environmental problem. Treatment of contaminated areas {{is a concern}} for governments and environmental authorities in several countries and efforts have been done with the purpose to eliminate this problem. Different methods have been tested and today the most common technique involves the excavation and transportation of contaminated soil to special treatment facilities. In earlier studies we have demonstrated {{the effect of adding}} organic amendments, such as fermented whey, on the biodegradation of n-alkanes in diesel contaminated soil. Non-fermented sweet whey also proved significantly to enhance the biodegradation of an <b>aromatic</b> <b>substance</b> (phenanthrene) in contaminated soil. The current paper presents the results of an in-situ field test at a former gas station in the north of Sweden. In parallel to the field study, biodegradation profiles were monitored under controlled laboratory conditions by taking soil samples from the contaminated site and spike them with diesel fuel. The experiments were carried out by adding whey and mineral nutrients (NPK) to the test area and to the laboratory samples, and monitor the degradation of hydrocarbons by gas chromatographic analysis of extracted soil samples. Significant effects on the degradation rates were achieved in the laboratory tests. For the in-situ test, however, no such positive effects could be registered. Bioremediatio...|$|E
