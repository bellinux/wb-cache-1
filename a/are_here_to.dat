5|$|Fellow Workers, {{this is the}} Continental Congress of the working-class. We <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> confederate {{the workers}} of this country into a working-class {{movement}} that shall have for its purpose the emancipation of the working-class from the slave bondage of capitalism. The aims and objects of this organization shall be to put the working-class in possession of the economic power, the means of life, {{in control of the}} machinery of production and distribution, without regard to capitalist masters.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, D.C., Mulder appears {{before an}} FBI panel {{regarding}} {{his experiences in}} Antarctica, but is later denied reassignment to the X-Files division: Mulder and Scully {{have been replaced by}} Spender and Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers). Later, Skinner is mysteriously poisoned by a nanorobot infection. The culprit is revealed to be Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a rogue FBI agent who formerly worked for the Syndicate, who continues to control the potentially debilitating nanotechnology in Skinner's system in order to achieve his goals. Mulder and Scully later learn of reports of rebel aliens burning doctors who were working on Cassandra. After finding her, she informs Mulder and Scully that the aliens <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> destroy all life on Earth and that she is a successful alien-human hybrid. The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) reveals everything to Diana Fowley, who agrees to help him and betray Mulder. Fowley forcibly takes Mulder, Cassandra, and Scully to a Centers for Disease Control facility at Fort Marlene. Meanwhile, the Syndicate rendezvous at a check point, preparing to be taken away by the Colonists, who are prepping for invasion. However, they are met by the alien rebels, who incinerate them all, including Cassandra—save The Smoking Man and Fowley, who escape. Jeffrey Spender is then purportedly killed by The Smoking Man.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully later {{learn of}} reports of rebel aliens burning doctors {{who were working}} on Cassandra Spender (Veronica Cartwright), an alien abductee and mother of Jeffrey Spender. Skinner takes Spender to the scene, where Cassandra asks for Mulder. She informs Mulder and Scully that the aliens <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> destroy all life on Earth. She claims that a rebel force of aliens are mutilating their faces to prevent {{infection}} by the black oil. Cigarette Smoking Man reveals everything to Diana Fowley, who agrees to help him and betray Mulder. Cassandra later escapes from a hospital and arrives at Mulder's apartment, demanding that he shoot her because she is the embodiment of fifty years of work by the Syndicate—an alien-human hybrid that will trigger colonization if the aliens learn of her existence.|$|E

5|$|Restoring the {{primitive}} scene {{is not done}} easily nor can it be done completely. Some species are extinct. Given time, an eastern hardwood forest can be regrown to maturity but the chestnut will be missing and so will the roar of pigeon wings. The colorful drapanid finches {{are not to be}} heard again in the lowland forests of Hawaii, nor will the jack-hammer of the ivory-bill ring in southern swamps. The wolf and grizzly bear cannot readily be reintroduced into ranching communities, and the factor of human use of the parks is subject only to regulation, not elimination. Exotic plants, animals, and diseases <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> stay. All these limitations we fully realize. Yet, if the goal cannot be fully achieved it can be approached. A reasonable illusion of primitive America could be recreated, using the utmost in skill, judgment, and ecologic sensitivity. This in our opinion should be the objective of every national park and monument.|$|E

The expedition is funded by Kaftan, who is accompanied by her manservant Toberman and her colleague Klieg. One of the men is electrocuted opening the doors, but the group manages to enter the chamber. They find a control panel and a large, sealed hatch. Parry and Klieg try to open it as Toberman leaves.|$|E

500|$|After {{his work}} with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and the American Railway Union, Debs' next major work in {{organizing}} a labor union came during {{the founding of the}} Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). On June 27, 1905, in Chicago, Illinois, Debs and other influential union leaders including Big Bill Haywood, leader of the Western Federation of Miners, and Daniel De León, leader of the Socialist Labor Party, held what Haywood called the [...] "Continental Congress of the working class". Haywood stated: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> confederate the workers of this country into a working class movement that shall have for its purpose the emancipation of the working class...", and for Debs: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> perform a task so great that it appeals to our best thought, our united energies, and will enlist our most loyal support; a task in the presence of which weak men might falter and despair, but from which it is impossible to shrink without betraying the working class." ...|$|E

500|$|MOBA {{has been}} {{mentioned}} in dozens of off-the-beaten-path guides to Boston, featured in international newspapers and magazines, and has inspired several other collections throughout the world that set out to rival its own visual atrocities. Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine noted that the attention the Museum of Bad Art receives {{is part of a}} wider trend of museums displaying [...] "the best bad art". The museum has been criticized for being anti-art, but the founders deny this, responding that its collection is a tribute to the sincerity of the artists who persevered with their art despite something going horribly wrong in the process. According to co-founder Marie Jackson, [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> celebrate an artist's right to fail, gloriously." ...|$|E

[...] Nevertheless, the resignation became effective on 1 February 1951, on which day Middleton began his role as university president.|$|E

Van der Byl responded in a speech on 8 August which asserted that [...] "The terrorists who are trained and equipped outside our border and who invade our country with the willing help of other governments are here for a much wider purpose than the overthrow of Rhodesia. They <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> represent a force which sees Rhodesia as just one more stepping stone to victory over South Africa because they see South Africa as a vital key to the security of America, Europe {{and the rest of the}} western world." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the highly}} publicized incident, West took a brief break from music and {{threw himself into}} fashion, only to hole up in Hawaii {{for the next few}} months writing and {{recording}} his next album. Importing his favorite producers and artists to work on and inspire his recording, West kept engineers behind the boards 24 hours a day and slept only in increments. Noah Callahan-Bever, a writer for Complex, was present during the sessions and described the [...] "communal" [...] atmosphere as thus: [...] "With the right songs and the right album, he can overcome any and all controversy, and we <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> contribute, challenge, and inspire."

Celebrating the end of his five-year ban from political activity on 15 April 2008, he told reporters: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> counter the massive propaganda campaign by Umno leaders, who are talking on Malay supremacy. And giving clear definitive answer in reply of this, to say that what we want, what we desire for is a new Malaysia, is supremacy for all Malaysians."

500|$|As a child, Mars {{spent time}} impersonating Elvis Presley. This playact {{had a major}} impact on his musical evolution; he later reflected: I watch the best. I'm a big fan of Elvis. I'm a big fan of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would go nuts! You can say the same thing for Prince or The Police. It's just guys who know that people <b>are</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> see a show, so I watch those guys and I love {{studying}} them because I'm a fan." [...] He also impersonated Michael Jackson and Little Richard, both of whom are major inspirations of his. Mars was raised on his father’s doo-wop collection — “simple four-chord songs that got straight to the point” and on Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis,and Frankie Lymon. The hip-hop productions by The Neptunes and Timbaland, that were played on the radio constantly, also influenced him.|$|E
