5|$|The Abbasid victory near Hama did not {{yet fully}} {{eradicate}} the Qarmatians from the area. Taking advantage {{of the absence of}} the local governor, Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh, who went to suppress a revolt in Egypt, in 906, a part of the Banu Kalb Bedouin rose up in rebellion, led by the Qarmatian Abu Ghanim, called Nasr. They raided the Hawran and Tiberias, and launched an attack on Damascus. Although they defeated its garrison, they could not take the city itself, and moved onto Tiberias, which they pillaged. Al-Husayn ibn Hamdan was sent to pursue them, but they withdrew to the desert and poisoned the water holes behind them and escaped. On 16 June 906, they attacked Hit on the Euphrates. The generals Muhammad ibn Ishaq ibn Kundajiq and Mu'nis al-Khadim marched against them from Baghdad, while al-Husayn ibn Hamdan moved against them from the west, trying to encircle them. To escape their predicament, the Bedouin killed Nasr and received a pardon by the caliphal authorities. The remaining Qarmatians moved south to Kufa, on the orders of the chief missionary Zikrawayh ibn Mihrawayh. On 2 October they launched an attack on the city, but although repulsed, they defeated a relief army sent from Baghdad to aid Kufa. Zikrawayh then marched to attack the caravans returning from the pilgrimage to Mecca. In November, three caravans where overwhelmed; the Qarmatians massacred indiscriminately—some 20,000 were reportedly killed in the second caravan alone—and carried off women and children as slaves, along with enormous booty. Finally, in early January 907, caliphal troops under Wasif ibn Sawartakin caught the Qarmatians near al-Qadisiyya and destroyed them. With these defeats, the Qarmatian movement virtually ceased to exist in the Syrian Desert, although their counterparts in Bahrayn remained an <b>active</b> <b>threat</b> for several decades to come.|$|E

As a result, the Qarmatian activities shifted east to the Euphrates, where Zikrawayh ibn Mihrawayh (the father of al-Husayn and Yahya) had also rebelled in 906 near Kufa. After leading an unsuccessful attack on Kufa and number of devastating raids on hajj caravans, he too was killed in early 907 by caliphal troops under Wasif ibn Sawartakin near al-Qadisiyya.

5000|$|The {{reasons behind}} the attack are uncertain. On one hand, it is {{possible}} that Alt Clut was targeted because it was regarded as a rich target. On the other hand, the remarkable duration of the siege could indicate that, instead of merely plundering Arthgal's realm, Amlaíb and Ímar specifically sought to capture the capital. It could be that Amlaíb and Ímar regarded the kings of Alt Clut as an <b>active</b> <b>threat</b> to their maritime interests, and that the fortress of Alt Clut served served the Britons much like how [...] were utilised as naval bases by the Vikings in Ireland. The destruction of the citadel may have allowed the Vikings to gain unrestricted access into central Scotland. On one hand, the recorded ethnicity of the Vikings' captives could reveal that the Britons of Alt Clut possessed many English and Pictish slaves or subjects. On the other hand, the recorded ethnicities may be evidence that Alt Clut's fall was the only recorded incident in what may have been a series of coeval Viking campaigns in the region, and may indicate that Amlaíb and Ímar not only established overlordship over the Strathclyde British, but that they also asserted power not only over the English of Lothian but throughout the Pictish realm. Although {{it is possible}} that the Scandinavians sought a connecting route between Dublin and York, the fact that there are no waterways or suitable portages that bridge the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth may well be evidence against this. The fact that the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland seems to show that Amlaíb promptly returned to Britain in about 872 could be evidence that the assault on Alt Clut was undertaken in the context of territorial conquest/control rather than the mere acquisition of portable wealth.|$|E

WMN is characterized by dynamic self-organization, selfconfiguration and self-healing to enable flexible integration, quick deployment, easy maintenance, low costs, high scalability, and reliable services. Security of such a network has always been an issue. In this paper, we have analyzed the fundamental security requirements of WMN and the challenges faced by it. We have also discussed the vulnerable features and possible <b>active</b> <b>threats</b> in WMN along with few defense mechanisms against such threats. This paper serves a baseline for developing a secured, full-proof WMN which takes care of all types of attacks.

50|$|With the {{addition}} of misuse cases, the notation can model both desired goals and <b>active</b> <b>threats.</b> The misuse case notation shows negative (possibly hostile) stakeholders as the primary actors for the misuse cases; these may be grouped {{on the right-hand side}} of the diagram. The notation may assist in discovering suitable mitigating or preventative goals, shown as subsidiary use cases. These often have the aim of improving security, safety, or reliability, which are non-functional goals. Non-functional requirements can to some extent be described in use case style using misuse cases to define negative goals; but the (positive) goals thus discovered are often functional. For example, if theft is a threat to security, then fitting locks is a mitigation; but that a door can be locked is a functional requirement.|$|R

40|$|Multicast is an {{indispensable}} communication technique in wireless mesh network (WMN). Many applications in WMN including multicast TV, {{audio and video}} conferencing, and multiplayer social gaming use multicast transmission. On the other hand, security in multicast transmissions is crucial, without which the network services are significantly disrupted. Existing secure routing protocols that address different active attacks are still vulnerable due to subtle nature of flaws in protocol design. Moreover, existing secure routing protocols assume that adversarial nodes cannot share an out-of-band communication channel which rules {{out the possibility of}} wormhole attack. In this paper, we propose SEMRAW (SEcure Multicast Routing Algorithm for Wireless mesh network) that is resistant against all known <b>active</b> <b>threats</b> including wormhole attack.
