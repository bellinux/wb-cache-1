40|$|Currently, most of {{railway track}} {{inspections}} are manually conducted by railroad track inspectors. Practically, {{it is not}} possible to inspect the thousand of miles of railway track by trained human inspector. This inspection takes too much time to inspect the defected railway track and then inform to the railway authority people. In this way it may lead to disaster. Hence to avoid delay and improve the accuracy, our propose system will automatically inspect the railway track by using vision based method and vibration based method. This method proposes continuous monitoring and assessment of the condition of the rail tracks which prevent major disasters. Our proposed system will inspect the rail track component such as missing bolts, tie plates, anchors etc by using vision based method and simultaneously do the calibration of railway track by using vibration based method. The system provides real-time monitoring and structural condition for railway track using vision based method and calibration to search the fault location on the track. Inspections include detecting defects on tracks, missing bolts, <b>anchor,</b> <b>tie</b> plate and clips etc. In vision based method camera we will use to capture the images or videos. In vibration based method some sensors we will use to detect the vibrations on the railway track. We will extract the signal from 2 -D...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. As a {{new type}} of {{building}} envelope, Gcrw is mainly used for excavation of foundation pit. It can stand by itself without the help of bracing, especially in soft soil area. Its stressed characteristic hasn’t been known yet. By using advanced big finite element software Abaqus/Cae, a simulation was made on model of Gcrw under soil pressure when a foundation pit is dug, while the whole excavation is divided into three continuous independent excavation stages. The result shows that Gcrw is a rather good building envelope, Gcrw and soil in the gridding form an integral earth-retaining structure and keep balance under soil pressure before or behind the structure, and have little displacement in horizontal direction. It is like a gravity-type retaining wall in its entirety, but takes on an elastic characteristic. The soil pressure presents a linear change, but its value is less than the theoretical value of calculation. The front wall of Gcrw, like a sheet, is the main flexural construction element, which is subjected to the pressure from side wall of foundation pit and produce curve deformation. The back wall of Gcrw has little displacement and almost is built in the clay. The partition wall endures the effect of the tensile force, its horizontal deformation increases with the build-in depth’s increasing. The back wall and the partition wall play a very important role in dragging back the front wall, the role of them is similar to a pair of <b>anchor</b> <b>tie.</b> The soil in the gridding not only provides soil pressure, but also can fix the back wall, so it is seen as a part of Gcrw and in favor of the Gcrw’s anti-overturn...|$|E

Attributes and ties can be historized when changes in the information they model need to be kept.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 14) The "Egg and Rope Series" {{evolved as}} {{a synthesis of}} ideas, conscious and unconscious, molded into an expression through a conceptual and physical act, involving materials, space and time. My intention was to utilize two seemingly unrelated objects, the egg and the rope, and create a multileveled visual perception of them. These particular objects were chosen not through an entirely explainable or logical process. On the surface, {{one could say that}} the egg is visually appealing; it is elliptical and smooth, yet tactile and fragile. Like all great works of art, it has a soul and meaning transcending its physical manifestation. More than simply fascinating as a design package and source of food, the egg is a potent symbol that few can match in its complexity. It is an omen involved with the mystery of creation. Primitive and ancient people ascribed magic powers to the egg. Finally, an egg is like a germ or seed of an idea; it can imply growth, life or death, depending on how it is used in connection with other elements and symbols. The second predominant image in this series is that of the rope. Visually ropes are appealing because of their regular curves and rough texture. This material, made of strands of fibers braided together, can function as a support or {{it can be used to}} pull, suspend, fasten, separate, drape, <b>anchor,</b> <b>tie</b> together or hang. Symbolically, it can be used either positively, as a supportive element, or it can be used as a threat, symbolizing danger, as in the hangman's noose. Because of the functional possibilities and the literal implications, this can become a powerful symbol [...] especially, in conjunction with the egg. (See more in text...|$|E

40|$|Conference ABSTRACT The {{approaches}} to the Terrace Tunnel on the Wellington Urban Motorway (State Highway 1) have large retaining structures that support the cuttings. The retaining structures are supported by a system of <b>anchors</b> <b>tied</b> back to <b>anchor</b> drive tunnels constructed in the hillside behind the walls. The retaining walls were designed in the 1970 ’s using a peak ground acceleration of 0. 25 g. Transit New Zealand commissioned Opus International Consultants to develop a maintenance strategy for the large approach walls. The strategy identified {{the need for a}} seismic performance assessment of these structures. The seismic performance of the walls was assessed for earthquakes with return periods of 475 years (operating level, 0. 38 g), 1000 years (design level, 0. 48 g) and a maximum credible earthquake (MCE) (contingency level, 0. 75 g). The factor of safety against slope instability was found to be less than one for the design level and MCE events. The resulting slope displacements of up to 350 mm are likely to be accommodated by ductile behaviour of the high capacity MacAlloy anchors. The assessment therefore concluded that collapse of the structures is not likely. The structure therefore meets its performance expectation of minimum damage in a design earthquake event and no collapse in a contingency level MCE event. ...|$|R
5000|$|Anchor {{modeling}} is an agile database modeling technique {{suited for}} information that {{changes over time}} both in structure and content. It provides a graphical notation used for conceptual modeling {{similar to that of}} entity-relationship modeling, with extensions for working with temporal data. The modeling technique involves four modeling constructs: the <b>anchor,</b> attribute, <b>tie</b> and knot, each capturing different aspects of the domain being modeled.The resulting models can be translated to physical database designs using formalized rules. When such a translation is done the tables in the relational database will mostly be in the sixth normal form.|$|R
