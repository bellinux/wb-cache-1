The {{most important factor}} in the area to influence both structure and stratigraphy is the Santa Susana overthrust. Overthrusting along the Santa Susana fault has in many cases taken place along more than one plane producing an imbricate structure. Structurally the period of orogeny which culminated in this overthrusting resulted in close and overturned folding and faulting. The most prominent anticlinal fold is that which extends in a nearly east-west direction across the entire width of the area and passes just below the Holt Ranch, in Browns Canyon. Faults which are older than the Santa Susana orogeny are found, and include both the normal and reverse types. Some of these earlier faults have cut out varying thicknesses of formation, introducing local stratigraphic gaps. Several periods of folding, uplift <b>arid</b> <b>erosion,</b> indicated by unconformities, are evident, and provide lines of weakness which have been influential in guiding and controlling the later folding. Thin development of formations and the numerous unconformities point to a very unstable area. Recent diadtrophic movement is indicated by folding and faulting of the (Pleistocene) Santa Susana overthrust plane. Through the medium of this overthrusting, an entirely different stratigraphy from that native to the area has been introduced. Above the thrust, a thick section composed of Modelo shale, (lower Monterey) (Valvulineria californica zone) shale, and non-marine Topanga sandstone, conglomerate, and basalt is found, This section, which has been overthrust from the north, presents an entirely different environmental lithology. The lithology below the thrust, and native to the area, is much less well-developed, and differs considerably from the introduced section found above the thrust. The poor development of these formations, {{and the fact that they}} thicken northward and that they are nearly all separated by unconformities, suggests a marginal oscillating environment in the old Miocene-Pliocene depositional basin. The overthrust section and sections to the north, as at Pico and Elsmeree canyons, are much thicker and lack many of the unconformities present in this area. These areas undoubtedly occupied a position nearer the center of the Miocene-Pliocene depositional basin. The oldest rock native to this area is the great thickness of Chico (Upper Cretaceous) sandstone, which makes up the boldly outcropping Simi Hills. Unconformably overlying this is the basal Martinez conglomerate (lower Eocene), which, in the particular area mapped, is in fault contact with younger Eocene to Pliocene formations. The only other Eocene formation mapped was the thick section (1300 feet [ [...] . ]) of Llajas (middle Eocene) shales and silts, which grade downward to sandstone and conglomerate near the base of the formation. The Llajas is abundantly fossiliferous. A big stratigraphic break separates the Liajas from an unconformably overlying upper Topanga conglomerate and silt, 50 to 100 feet thick. This thin section of marine fossiliferous Topanga, limited above and below by unconformities, is a marked contrast to the thick section of non marine sandstone, conglomerate, and basalt which lies above the thrust and was introduced from an area to the north by overthrusting. Disconformably above the Topanga, in the section native to the area, is found a thin section of argillaceous Modelo shale, varying in thickness from about 25 feet in the southern part of the area to more than 100 feet in the northern portion, where sandstone lenses and layers are found interbedded. This relatively thin section is in marked contrast to the thick overthrust section of Modelo, which is in excess of a thousand feet thick. The Valvulineria californica shale section found between the Topanga non-marine and Modelo shale lying above the thrust is not found in the section below the thrust. Disconformably above the "native" Modelo shale is found a late lower and early middle Pliocene concretionary silt which is equal in age to about the middle of the Pico formation at the type section in Pico Canyon. This partial equivalent of the type Pico has been designated as the Pico formation in the area mapped. An unconformity separates these Pico silts from an overlying sandstone, conglomerate and fossil reef formation which has been designated the San Diego formation because of the similarity of its abundant fossil content with that of the type San Diego. This 75 to 100 foot thickness of upper middle Pliocene-San Diego strata is, however, an age equivalent of the upper Pico formation at its type locality. Both mega- and micro- fossil evidence points to this. Thus it may be said that the time represented in the accumulation of the strata at the type locality of the Pico formation has its equivalent in the Aliso and Browns Canyons area. This time equivalent is represented by the San Diego formation, the so-called Pico silts of the area, the unconformity separating the two, and by part of the time represented in the unconformity below the Pico silts and above the Miocene Modelo formation. The San Diego formation grades upward into brackish and non-marine Saugus deposits composed of 500 feet of sands, conglomerates and mudstones. All of these previously mentioned formations were involved in the latest severe folding which culminated in the Santa Susana overthrust. Lying on the erosion surface formed by the partial beveling of these folded deposits are found younger Pleistocene terrace and river channel deposits consisting of large, hard, sandstone boulders, mud, and Modelo shale fragments...|$|E

40|$|Landscape archaeological {{research}} has been undertaken on the mound of Barcin Höyük in northwest Anatolia, Turkey. It is the oldest Neolithic site in the region, making it of particular interest {{in regard to the}} spread of farming from the regions of origin (southeast and central Anatolia) to northwest Anatolia. This study shows that the site was founded approximately 8550 a cal BP on a natural elevation in a generally wet environment, {{at the edge of a}} retreating lake. The site was subject to environmental shifts in younger periods, with a phase of <b>arid</b> conditions and <b>erosion</b> at least prior to the Bronze Age, succeeded by a phase of more humid conditions and rising lake levels mostly in the last two millennia, and finally a return to arid conditions and declining lake levels. Considering the Neolithic environmental conditions, the local environment of Barcin Höyük resembled the local environment of Çatalhöyük, a central Anatolian site. This suggests that despite the general differences between the regions, the earliest sedentary population of northwest Anatolia favoured local conditions similar to those of central Anatolia, while younger sites in the aforementioned region diverge to slightly different localities...|$|R
40|$|Off-site {{soil erosion}} has {{tremendous}} {{impacts on the}} present state of most river systems throughout the United States, contributing sediments to channels mainly as nonpoint pollution resulting from land-use and agricultural practices and leading to sedimentation downstream and downwind, a decrease in the transport capacity of streams, increase in the risk of flooding, filling reservoirs, and eutrophication. A primary focus in examining the problems associated with soil <b>erosion</b> <b>arid</b> ultimately in proposing control measures should be on identifying the sources of the sediment. Therefore, a model that would be able to assess soil erosion needs to start by identifying the sediment sources and delivery paths to channels, link these sediment supply processes to in-channel sediment transport and storage and ultimately to basin sediment yield. This study focuses on the Upper Green River Basin in Kentucky and is concerned with analyzing hillslope erosion rates using The Unit Stream Power Erosion and Deposition soil erosion model (Mitas and Mitasova, 1996) and GIS, and thereby estimating patterns of sediment supply to rivers in order to predict which portions of the channel network are more likely to store large amounts of fine sediments. Results indicate that much of the eroded sediments are redistributed within the hillslope system, but also that a large proportion is delivered to the channel. These predictions have been tested by sampling the fine sediment content of the streambed at key locations along the channel network and comparing the observed patterns to those predicted by the soil erosion model. By linking topographic and soil characteristics with land cover data, it has been concluded that high intensity erosion tends to occur at contact between different vegetation covers, on barren lands and croplands, and 15 - 25...|$|R
40|$|In the {{observational}} sciences, technical advances are often followed by dramatic increases in scientific discoveries and improved theory. Leuwenhoek’s microscope and Galileo’s telescope {{gave us a}} “better look” at the microworld and the cosmos, which led to revolutions of past paradigms. In geomorphology and landscape analysis, similar advances have accompanied new maps and new mapping techniques. The first accurate globes, where the puzzle-piece fit of the southern continents was quickly noticed, were soon followed by the first mention {{of what would be}} continental drift. The first topographic maps were accompanied by similar shifts in thinking. For example, accurate topographic maps of the western US brought about the realization that even in <b>arid</b> regions, fluvial <b>erosion</b> can be the dominant landscaping force. Aerial photography provided a similar advance in observation, mapping and understanding. Satellite imagery of the Earth and other planets has dramatically revealed the geomorphic processes operating in inaccessible places, for example meteor impacts, volcanism and the importance of eolian and fluvial processes. Recent observations of Pluto and Mars attest to this fact. Satellite imagery also led to a revolution in glacial geomorphology by providing continent-wide images of features heretofore unnoticed, for example the palimpsest flow indicators of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (Boulton & Clark 1990). In the 90 s, the production of digital elevation models (DEMs) and the development of geographic information system (GIS) tools allowed for new highly quantitative analysis of landscapes. The advent of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology is poised to provide a similar rapid advance in observations and the potential for significant advances in geomorphic theory. We see that the ever increasing use of LiDAR technology is creating a similar leap forward in geomorphology, and this issue is dedicated to illustrating this fact for Scandinavi...|$|R
40|$|Travertines {{represent}} an important deposit {{in the whole}} central Apennine: in fact, travertine deposits outcrop in few large areas and in several minor sites, mainly distributed along the Apenninic chain and its west and east piedmont area (i. e. Orte-Roma; Rieti and Valle Velina; Assisi; Pale; Cerreto di Spoleto; Popoli and Tocco da Casauria; Rosara; Civitella del Tronto; Roccamontepiano). They are constituted by groups of lithofacies, evidencing different depositional mechanisms; phytohermal facies, sometimes with phytoclastic gravels and sands intercalated, testify locally high and/or low energy environments (sometimes associated with presence of thermal waters). All deposits show the same depositional environment, developed in fluvial system (characterized by phytohermal barrages, with downstream accretionary sets and upstream dammed areas); this fact is testified by the outcrops distribution (symmetric and parallel to river axis), {{by the presence of}} typical fluvial facies and by relationship with alluvial deposits. Travertine mainly forms during interglacial periods (such as Middle Pleistocene, Late Pleistocene and Holocene), when climatic improvement strongly enhance vegetation growth with consequent high amount of dissolved CO 2 in infiltrating waters; on the contrary, cold <b>arid</b> phases, favored <b>erosion</b> of the aforementioned deposits and of the underlying bedrock. Valley deepening, consequent to climatic conditions (such as glacial-interglacial transition) and/or periods of more intense tectonic uplift, caused rapid lowering of the piezometric surface inside carbonate aquifers; this fact increased the hydrologic regime of the rivers together with climate improvement, favorable conditions to travertines deposition. Almost all deposits are constituted by several plates located at different heights, from about 100 m up to 900 m a. s. l.; concerning the chronology of deposits, from geomorphological setting and radiometric datations, is possible to award, at the different deposits, an age starting from Middle Pleistocene up to Holocene. Differences in height between Holocene and Pleistocene travertine deposits can be used as further geomorphological evidences of widespread Quaternary uplift; then this study aims at a contribution of knowledge of Quaternary evolution of central Italy, using geomorphological, sedimentological, geochemical and, when possible, chronological data...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Macquarie University, Division of Environmental & Life Sciences, Graduate School of the Environment, 2002. Includes bibliographical references: p. 228 - 232. Geomorphology, {{archaeology}} and geoarchaeology: introduction and background [...] Surface stone artefact scatters: why {{can we see}} them? [...] Geomorphic controls on spatial patterning of the surface stone artefact record [...] A temporal framework for interpreting surface artefact scatters in Western NSW [...] Synthesis: stone artefact scatters in a dynamic landscape. Surface scatters of stone artefacts are the most ubiquitous feature of the Australian Aboriginal archaeological record, yet the most underutilized by archaeologists in developing models of Aboriginal prehistory. Among the many reasons for this are the {{lack of understanding of}} geomorphic processes that have exposed them, and the lack of a suitable chronological framework for investigating Aboriginal 'use of place'. This thesis addresses both of these issues. [...] In <b>arid</b> western NSW, <b>erosion</b> and deposition accelerated {{as a result of the}} introduction of sheep grazing in the mid 1800 s has resulted in exposure of artefact scatters in some areas, burial in others, and complete removal in those parts of the landscape subject to concentrated flood flows. The result is a patchwork of artefact scatters exhibiting various degrees of preservation, exposure and visibility. My research at Stud Creek, in Sturt National Park in far western NSW, develops artefact and landscape survey protocols to accommodate this dynamic geomorphic setting. A sampling strategy stratified on the basis of landscape morphodynamics is presented that allows archaeologists to target areas of maximum artefact exposure and minimum post-discard disturbance. Differential artefact visibility at the time of the survey is accommodated by incorporating measures of surface cover which quantify the effects of various ephemeral environmental processes, such as deposition of sediments, vegetation growth, and bioturbation, on artefact count. [...] While surface stone artefact scatters lack the stratigraphy usually considered necessary for establishing the timing of Aboriginal occupation, a combination of radiocarbon determinations on associated heat-retainer ovens, and stratigraphic analysis and dating of the valley fills which underlie the scatters, allows a two-stage chronology for huntergatherer activity to be developed. In the Stud Creek study area, dating of the valley fill by OSL established a maximum age of 2, 040 ± 100 y for surface artefact scatters. The heatretainer ovens ranged in age from 1630 ± 30 y BP to 220 ± 55 y BP. Bayesian statistical analysis of the sample of 28 radiocarbon determinations supported the notion, already established from analysis of the artefacts, that the Stud Creek valley was occupied intermittently for short durations over a relatively long period of time, rather than intensively occupied at any one time. Furthermore, a gap in oven building between about 800 and 1100 years ago was evident. Environmental explanations for this gap are explored, but the paiaeoenvironmental record for this part of the Australian arid zone is too sparse and too coarse to provide explanations of human behaviour on time scales of just a few hundred years. [...] Having established a model for Stud Creek of episodic landscape change throughout the late Pleistocene and Holocene, right up to European contact, its veracity was evaluated in a pilot study at another location within the region. The length of the archaeological record preserved in three geomorphically distinct locations at Fowlers Gap, 250 km south of Stud Creek, is a function of geomorphic dynamics, with a record of a few hundred years from sites located on channel margins and low terraces, and the longest record thus far of around 5, 000 years from high terrace surfaces more remote from active channel incision. But even here, the record is not continuous, and like Stud Creek, the gaps are interpreted to indicate that Aboriginal people moved into and out of these places intermittently throughout the mid to late Holocene. [...] I conclude that episodic nonequilibrium characterizes the geomorphic history of these arid landscapes, with impacts on the preservation of the archaeological record. Dating of both archaeological and landform features shows that the landscape, and the archaeological record it preserves, are both spatially and temporally disjointed. Models of Aboriginal hunter-gatherer behaviour and settlement patterns must take account of these discontinuities in an archaeological record that is controlled by geomorphic activity. [...] I propose a new geoarchaeological framework for landscape-based studies of surface artefact scatters that incorporates geomorphic analysis and dating of landscapes, as well as tool typology, into the interpretation of spatial and temporal patterns of Aboriginal huntergatherer 'use of place'.

40|$|Geology of {{the north}} half of the White Mountain Quadrangle, California-Nevada: The White Mountain range, the {{principal}} topographic unit of the White Mountain Quadrangle, is an up-faulted block between two relatively depressed areas. It differs from the ordinary basin range block {{in that it is}} a tilted horst. The marginal faults of the horst are of unusual complexity. Physiographically, the range is in the late youthful or early mature stage of the <b>arid</b> cycle of <b>erosion.</b> Glaciation has complicated to some degree the normal development of the cycle. Renewal of uplift by faulting appears to have taken place in recent times. Upon the crest of the range are remnants of land surfaces of low relief, formed, probably, by erosion before the block faulting which uplifted the range. These surfaces are designated herein as the "Pellisier Erosion Surface" and the "Sub-summit Oldland". It is probable that both were formed in the same cycle of erosion. The core of the range is a granite batholith, intrusive into Cambrian or pre-Cambrian sedimentary rocks, chiefly calcareous and argillaceous in composition. For this ancient sedimentary series the name "McNett Formation" is proposed. It is non-fossiferous but {{on the basis of its}} lithology it is considered to be the equivalent of a thick series of dolomites and "green knotted schists" which Turner described as underlying the lowest fossiliferous Cambrian in the Silver Peak Quadrangle. The contacts of the intrusive and the ancient sediments are everywhere characterized by intense contact metamorphism. This is described in some detail in the section on petrography. Overlying the older rocks is a volcanic series of Tertiary age. These are chiefly rhyolites with some andesites. They include flows and pyroclastics. Vertebrate remains discovered in playa deposits closely associated with the extrusive rocks indicate that the latter were accumulated in part during the upper Miocene and lower Pliocene. The most recent igneous rocks in the area are Quaternaty basalts which cover much {{of the north}}ers part of the quadrangle. In the petrography section of this thesis, separately paged and indexed, are to be found descriptions and discussions of certain types of alteration affecting the rocks of the batholith on an enormous scale. These alterations, believed to be of hydrothermal origin, include the albitization of the potash feldspars and the development of a replacement texture closely resembling cataclastic texture but distinguished from the latter by its corrosive pattern and by the formation accompanying it of a large number of minerals not present in the original rock. Petrography of the north half of the White Mountains Quadrangle California-Nevada: The igneous rocks of the north half of the White Mountain Quadrangle consist of a group of closely related intrusives, probably of Jurassic Age, and a Tertiary-Quaternary series of extrusives. The former, chiefly granitic in composition, compose the White Mountain batholith which intrudes calcareous and argillaceous rocks of early Cambrian or pre-Cambrian Age. The batholith is surrounded by a wide zone of intense contact metamorphism. The volcanic series may be subdivided into two groups. The earlier, whose accumulation probably occupied much of the middle and later Tertiary, is predominately siliceous in composition. The later, for the most part Quaternary in age, consists of basic andesites and basalts. In the following thesis all of these groups of rocks, including the contact metamorphics, are described in detail. Especial attention is paid to certain compositional and textural peculiarities exhibited by the intrusives. These peculiarities are highly significant, not only in the history of these particular rocks, but also in respect the general problem of the genesis of sodic and alkaline types. They are the result of replacement processes which appear to have been active on an enormous scale through the batholithic mass at a time considerably later than at least the outer parts of the magma. They involved the introduction of large quantities of material, especially sodium and silica and possibly also iron and magnesium from some source outside the field tion. The results are evident in the wholesale albitization of the potash feldspars, formation of secondary minerals including quartz, sericite, chlorite, epidote, biotite and hornblende and in the development of a texture here designated pseudo-cataclastic texture which closely resembles true cataclastic texture but is distinguishable from the latter by criteria set forth below. Stratigraphy and faunal relationships of Pliocene beds of San Diego age in the vicinity of Las Llajas Canyon, Simi Valley, California: The results of a careful search of the literature for material bearing upon replacement processes in igneous rocks are set forth in the thesis. Various theories which may account for the phenomena are critically discussed. Overlying the Modelo Formation of Upper Miocene age north of Simi Valley is a series of arenaceous beds of marine origin whose stratigraphy and faunal relationships have heretofore been in doubt. At the suggestion of Dr. W. P. Woodring, then Professor of Invertebrate Paleontology at the California Institute of Technology, I undertook to study some of these beds as part of my preparation for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. The following report covers in particular the section exposed from Las Llajas Canyon west to about two miles beyond Tapo Canyon. </p...|$|R
