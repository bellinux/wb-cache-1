5|$|<b>Adopted</b> <b>{{children}}</b> {{are children}} that were given up at birth, abandoned or {{were unable to}} be cared for by their biological parents. They may have been put into foster care before finding their permanent residence. It is particularly hard for <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> to get adopted from foster care: 50,000 children were adopted in 2001. The average age of these children was 7, which shows that fewer older children were adopted.|$|E

5|$|Belief in {{prenatal}} fetal awareness, mental {{communication between}} mother and unborn child, and emotional attachment of child to mother as a prenatal phenomenon, are concepts that connect easily to the unfounded assumption that all <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> suffer emotional disorders.

5|$|Parents can {{be either}} the {{biological}} mother or biological father, or the legal guardian for <b>adopted</b> <b>children.</b> Traditionally, mothers were responsible for raising the kids while the father was out providing financially for the family.

Older parents are financially established and generally have fewer problems raising children compared to their teenage counterparts.|$|E
5|$|When parents die of HIV/AIDS, {{extended}} family members usually become the children's primary caregivers: in Malawi, 44% of double orphans are adopted by grandparents or other close relatives.

For example, family members {{who are unable to}} support <b>adopted</b> <b>children</b> often arrange early marriages for female orphans, who may then become victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse.|$|E

5|$|Spanish bishops {{also claimed}} that the Government, by {{extending}} the right of marriage to same-sex couples, weakened the meaning of marriage, which they defined as an involving a heterosexual couple. The Spanish Family Forum expressed concern over the possibility of same-sex couples adopting and raising children, and argued that adoption is not a right for the parents, but for the adopted. Gay associations replied that de facto adoption by same-sex couples had existed {{for a long time}} in Spain, since many couples were rearing minors adopted by one of the partners. Adoption by same-sex couples was already legal in Navarre (2000), the Basque Country (2003), Aragon (2004), Catalonia (2005) and Cantabria (2005) before the same-sex marriage law legalized these adoptions nationwide. Furthermore, in Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002) and Extremadura (2003), same-sex couples could jointly begin procedures to temporarily or permanently take children in care. These associations also argued that there was no scientific basis for the claim that the parents' sexual orientation would cause developmental problems for their <b>adopted</b> <b>children.</b> This view is officially supported by the Spanish School of Psychology, which also states that homosexuality is not a pathology.|$|E
5|$|After much research, Bella {{concludes that}} Edward is {{seemingly}} human, but has mysterious powers resembling to a vampire. He eventually confirms this, {{but says he}} and the other Cullens only consume animal blood. The pair fall in love, and Edward introduces Bella to his vampire family. Carlisle Cullen, the family patriarch, is a doctor working at the hospital in Forks. His wife is Esme, and Alice, Jasper, Emmett, and Rosalie, are their informally <b>adopted</b> <b>children.</b> Edward and Bella's relationship is soon put in jeopardy, when three nomadic vampires—James, Victoria, and Laurent—arrive in Forks. James, a tracker vampire with incredible hunting instincts, is instantly intrigued by Edward's protectiveness over a human, which incites him to hunt Bella for sport. Edward and the other Cullens risk their lives to protect Bella, but James tracks her to Phoenix, where she is hiding with Jasper and Alice. James lures Bella into a trap by falsely claiming that he is holding her mother hostage. James attacks Bella by biting her wrist, infecting her with vampire venom. After a ferocious battle, Edward subdues James just as the other Cullens arrive. Alice, Emmett, and Jasper kill James, decapitating and burning him, as Edward removes the venom from Bella's wrist, preventing her from turning into a vampire. In the aftermath of the battle, Bella has suffered a broken leg, and ends up in the hospital, but her mother comes in to visit. Upon returning to Forks, Edward accompanies Bella to the high school prom, where he refuses to grant her request that he would transform her into a vampire. As the couple dance, they are unaware that James' mate, Victoria, is secretly watching, plotting revenge for her lover's death.|$|E

40|$|The aim with my {{work was}} to gain a deeper {{understanding}} of some adult adopted children’s experiences and reflections about which role parent ship plays for the <b>adopted</b> <b>child’s</b> development of identity. Following questions have been in focus: What does a working parent ship imply, seen from the perspective of <b>adopted</b> <b>child?</b> In which way can the development of identity for the <b>adopted</b> <b>child</b> be supported by a functional parent ship? Semi-structured interviews were carried out with the two following themes: Support and confirmation. The sample consisted of five foreign-adopted between the age of 18 and 37 years. The result showed that the major part of the interview had a common picture of what a functional parent ship should be in order for an <b>adopted</b> <b>child</b> to have a favourable development of the identity, namely to have an understanding of how it is to be adopted, as being the most important and the sole base for the parent-ship. The discussion concerned obstacles and possibilities for a functional parent ship regarding the <b>adopted</b> <b>child’s</b> development of identity...|$|R
