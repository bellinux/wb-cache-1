5|$|The 1956 Ashes tour to England was <b>a</b> <b>disappointment</b> for Harvey {{individually}} as {{well for}} the Australians collectively.

5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on June 21, 1991 and received generally favorable reviews from critics, although plans for Rocketeer sequels were abandoned after the film was <b>a</b> <b>disappointment</b> at the box office, grossing $46 million on a $40 million budget, $6 million over the film's budget.

5|$|By 1928 the Southern Railway {{was well}} served by large 4-6-0 express {{passenger}} locomotives, {{but there was an}} urgent need for a class to fulfill intermediate roles throughout the system. Maunsell’s previous attempt at developing his predecessor’s L class for this task had proven <b>a</b> <b>disappointment,</b> and the Drummond D15 and L12 classes were approaching the end of their useful lives on these services. An entirely new secondary express passenger locomotive was required to operate over the main lines throughout the system including those that had relatively short turntables.|$|E
5|$|Hancock {{rejoined the}} Continental Congress in Pennsylvania in June 1778, but his brief {{time there was}} unhappy.

Hancock got along poorly with Samuel Adams, and missed his wife and newborn son. On July 9, 1778, Hancock and the other Massachusetts delegates joined the representatives from seven other states in signing the Articles of Confederation; the {{remaining}} states were not yet prepared to sign, and the Articles would not be ratified until 1781.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Giants {{were unable}} to build on their {{successful}} 1997 season, and needed a four-game winning streak to close out the season at 8–8.

However, the offense continued to be <b>a</b> <b>disappointment.</b> Brown had been jettisoned and replaced by Kanell and Kent Graham. Neither quarterback provided Pro Bowl caliber play, although Graham led the Giants to a 5–1 finish (including an upset of the then-undefeated Denver Broncos in Week 15).|$|E

5|$|In 2010, {{after leading}} the {{division}} {{standing by the}} end of April, the Mets again began to struggle. The Mets would not hold first place at any point after May 1, although they came close in mid-June. By {{the end of the season}} the Mets had finished 18 games behind the first place Phillies. For its part, Philadelphia was mainly engaged in a fierce division race with the Atlanta Braves, trailing them as late in the season as September 6.

5|$|Tech's {{fortunes}} declined dramatically {{following the}} victory over Miami. The {{week after that}} win, Tech lost 31–28 to Pittsburgh, then escaped with a one-point win in overtime against Temple University, which had just one win that season.

That figure represented an improvement over the Greenback vote of 1876, but to Weaver, who expected twice as many votes as he received, it was <b>a</b> <b>disappointment.</b>|$|E
