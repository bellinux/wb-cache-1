5|$|This {{ability of}} Clostridium to metabolize sugars directly, or to produce acetic acid from less costly inputs, {{suggests}} that these bacteria could produce acetic acid more efficiently than ethanol-oxidizers like <b>Acetobacter.</b> However, Clostridium bacteria are less acid-tolerant than <b>Acetobacter.</b> Even the most acid-tolerant Clostridium strains can produce vinegar in concentrations {{of only a few}} per cent, compared to <b>Acetobacter</b> strains that can produce vinegar in concentrations up to 20%. At present, it remains more cost-effective to produce vinegar using <b>Acetobacter,</b> rather than using Clostridium and concentrating it. As a result, although acetogenic bacteria have been known since 1940, their industrial use is confined to a few niche applications.|$|E
5|$|A dilute alcohol {{solution}} inoculated with <b>Acetobacter</b> {{and kept}} in a warm, airy place will become vinegar {{over the course of}} a few months. Industrial vinegar-making methods accelerate this process by improving the supply of oxygen to the bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid is {{produced}} and excreted by acetic acid bacteria, notably the <b>Acetobacter</b> genus and Clostridium acetobutylicum. These bacteria are found universally in foodstuffs, water, and soil, and acetic acid {{is produced}} naturally as fruits and other foods spoil. Acetic acid {{is also a}} component of the vaginal lubrication of humans and other primates, where it appears to serve as a mild antibacterial agent.|$|E
5|$|The first {{batches of}} vinegar {{produced}} by fermentation probably followed {{errors in the}} winemaking process. If must is fermented at too high a temperature, <b>acetobacter</b> will overwhelm the yeast naturally occurring on the grapes. As the demand for vinegar for culinary, medical, and sanitary purposes increased, vintners quickly learned to use other organic materials to produce vinegar in the hot summer months before the grapes were ripe and ready for processing into wine. This method was slow, however, and not always successful, as the vintners {{did not understand the}} process.|$|E
25|$|Ammonia is {{not used}} by {{bacteria}} such as <b>Acetobacter</b> and the lactic acid bacteria used in malolactic fermentation.|$|E
25|$|As with yeast, oxygen can be {{considered}} a nutrient for LAB, but only in very small amount and only for microaerophilic species such as O. oeni. However, no evidence exists currently to suggest that malolactic fermentation runs more smoothly in aerobic conditions than in complete anaerobic conditions, and in fact, excessive amounts of oxygen can retard growth of LAB by favoring conditions of competing microbes (such as <b>Acetobacter).</b>|$|E
25|$|Bacteria {{that produce}} {{cellulose}} include Gram-negative bacteria {{species such as}} <b>Acetobacter,</b> Azotobacter, Rhizobium, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, Alcaligenes, and Gram-positive bacteria species such as Sarcina ventriculi. The most effective producers of cellulose are A. xylinum, A. hansenii, and A. pasteurianus. Of these, A. xylinum is the model microorganism for basic and applied studies on cellulose due to its ability to produce relatively high levels of polymer {{from a wide range}} of carbon and nitrogen sources.|$|E
25|$|Acetic acid in wine, often {{referred}} to as volatile acidity (VA) or vinegar taint, can be contributed by many wine spoilage yeasts and bacteria. This can be from either a by-product of fermentation, or due to the spoilage of finished wine. Acetic acid bacteria, such as those from the genera <b>Acetobacter</b> and Gluconobacter produce high levels of acetic acid. The sensory threshold for acetic acid in wine is >700mg/L, with concentrations greater than 1.2-1.3 g/L becoming unpleasant.|$|E
25|$|Acetic acid is a two-carbon {{organic acid}} {{produced}} in wine {{during or after}} the fermentation period. It is the most volatile of the primary acids associated with wine and {{is responsible for the}} sour taste of vinegar. During fermentation, activity by yeast cells naturally produces a small amount of acetic acid. If the wine is exposed to oxygen, <b>Acetobacter</b> bacteria will convert the ethanol into acetic acid. This process is known as the “acetification” of wine and is the primary process behind wine degradation into vinegar. An excessive amount of acetic acid is also considered a wine fault. A taster's sensitivity to acetic acid will vary, but most people can detect excessive amounts at around 600mg/l.|$|E
25|$|In the {{winemaking}} process, acids aid {{in enhancing}} {{the effectiveness of}} sulfur dioxide to protect the wines from spoilage and can also protect the wine from bacteria due to the inability of most bacteria to survive in low pH solutions. Two notable exceptions to this are <b>Acetobacter</b> and the lactic acid bacteria. In red wines, acidity helps preserve and stabilize {{the color of the}} wine. The ionization of anthocyanins is affected by pH, so wines with lower pH (such as Sangiovese-based wines) have redder, more stable colors. Wines with higher pH (such as Syrah-based wines) have higher levels of less stable blue pigments, eventually taking on a muddy grey hue. These wines can also develop a brownish tinge. In white wines, higher pH (lower acidity) causes the phenolics in the wine to darken and eventually polymerize as brown deposits.|$|E
500|$|For most {{of human}} history, acetic acid {{bacteria}} {{of the genus}} <b>Acetobacter</b> have made acetic acid, {{in the form of}} vinegar. Given sufficient oxygen, these bacteria can produce vinegar from a variety of alcoholic foodstuffs. Commonly used feeds include apple cider, wine, and fermented grain, malt, rice, or potato mashes. The overall chemical reaction facilitated by these bacteria is: ...|$|E
500|$|Microorganisms {{are used}} to produce many {{commercial}} and industrial chemicals, enzymes and other bioactive molecules. Organic acids produced on a large industrial scale by microbial fermentation include acetic acid produced by acetic acid bacteria such as <b>Acetobacter</b> aceti, [...] butyric acid made by the bacterium Clostridium butyricum, lactic acid made by Lactobacillus and other lactic acid bacteria, and citric acid produced by the mould fungus Aspergillus niger.|$|E
500|$|Microorganisms {{are used}} for many {{commercial}} and industrial purposes, including the production of chemicals, enzymes and other bioactive molecules, often through protein engineering. For example, acetic acid is produced by the [...] bacterium <b>Acetobacter</b> aceti, while citric acid is produced by the fungus Aspergillus niger. Microorganisms are used to prepare a widening range of bioactive molecules and enzymes. For example, Streptokinase produced by the bacterium Streptococcus and modified by genetic engineering is used to remove clots from the blood vessels of patients who have suffered a heart attack. Cyclosporin A is an immunosuppressive agent in organ transplantation, while statins produced by the yeast Monascus purpureus serve as blood cholesterol lowering agents, competitively inhibiting the enzyme that synthesizes cholesterol.|$|E
2500|$|As a material, {{cellulose}} {{was first}} discovered in 1838 by Anselme Payen. Payen {{was able to}} isolate the cellulose from the other plant matter and chemically characterize it. [...] In one of its first and most common industrial applications, cellulose from wood pulp was used to manufacture paper. [...] It is ideal for displaying information in print form due to its high reflectivity, high contrast, low cost and flexibility. The discovery of cellulose produced by bacteria, specifically from the <b>Acetobacter</b> xylinum, was accredited to A.J. Brown in 1886 with the synthesis of an extracellular gelatinous mat. However, {{it was not until}} the 20th century that more intensive studies on bacterial cellulose were conducted. Several decades after the initial discovery of microbial cellulose, C.A. Browne studied the cellulose material obtained by fermentation of Louisiana sugar cane juice and affirmed the results by A.J. Brown. Other researchers reported the formation of cellulose by other various organisms such as the <b>Acetobacter</b> pasteurianum, <b>Acetobacter</b> rancens, Sarcina ventriculi, and Bacterium xylinoides. In 1931, Tarr and Hibbert published the first detailed study of the formation of bacterial cellulose by conducting a series of experiments to grow A. xylinum on culture mediums.|$|E
2500|$|Called graisse (or [...] "grease") by the French and les vins filant by Pasteur, this fault {{has been}} {{observed}} in apple wines and cider. It can also be potentially be caused by other spoilage microbes such as Streptococcus mucilaginous, Candida krusei, and <b>Acetobacter</b> rancens.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{completion}} of malolactic fermentation means [...] the winemaker {{can make a}} postfermentation SO2 earlier to protect the wine from oxidation and spoilage microbes (such as <b>Acetobacter).</b> Since sulfur dioxide can inhibit MLF, delaying LAB inoculation till after alcoholic fermentation may mean a delay in sulfur addition till early spring when cellar temperatures warm up enough to encourage the {{completion of}} MLF.|$|E
2500|$|A wine's quality can {{be judged}} by its bouquet and taste. The bouquet is the total {{aromatic}} experience of the wine. Assessing a wine's bouquet can also reveal faults such as cork taint; oxidation due to age, overexposure to oxygen, or lack of preservatives; and wild yeast or bacterial contamination, such as those due to <b>Acetobacter</b> or Brettanomyces yeasts. [...] Although low levels of Brettanomyces aromatic characteristics can be a positive attribute, giving the wine a distinctive character, generally it is considered a wine spoilage yeast.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, among American winemakers, {{seemingly}} healthy fermentation were reported becoming rapidly inundated {{with high levels}} of acetic acid that overcame wine yeasts and led to stuck fermentations. While a novel species of <b>Acetobacter</b> or wine spoilage yeast was initially thought to be the culprit, it was eventually discovered to be several species of Lactobacillus, L. kunkeei, L. nagelii, and L. hilgardii, collectively nicknamed [...] "ferocious" [...] Lactobacillus for their aggressive acetic acid production, how quickly they multiply, and their high tolerance to sulfur dioxides and other microbiological controls.|$|E
2500|$|Pasteur {{identified}} several causes of wine spoilage including some {{that could be}} controlled during winemaking. He noted that [...] "graisse" [...] {{was due to the}} production of polysaccharide, degradation of sugars led to mannitic acid and that the degradation of glycerol led to bitterness in the wine. Pasteur found that the particular problem of Burgundy wine spoiling and turning into vinegar on long voyages to England was caused by the bacterium <b>acetobacter.</b> The results of Pasteur's studies revolutionized the French understanding of winemaking and eventually spread to other wine regions across the globe.|$|E
2500|$|While {{volatile}} acidity (VA) is usually {{measured in terms}} of acetic acid content, its sensory perception is a combination of acetic (vinegary aromas) and ethyl acetate (nail polish remover and model airplane glue aromas). High levels of VA can inhibit wine yeast and may lead to a sluggish or stuck fermentation. Several microbes can be a source for VA, including <b>Acetobacter,</b> Brettanomyces, [...] and film yeast such as Candida, as well as LAB. However, while LAB usually only produce acetic acid, these other microbes [...] often produce ethyl acetate, as well as acetic acid.|$|E
2500|$|Bacterial {{cellulose}} is {{an organic}} compound with the formula [...] produced by {{certain types of}} bacteria. While cellulose is a basic structural material of most plants, it is also produced by bacteria, principally of the genera <b>Acetobacter,</b> Sarcina ventriculi and Agrobacterium. Bacterial, or microbial, cellulose has different properties from plant cellulose and is characterized by high purity, strength, moldability and increased water holding ability. In natural habitats, the majority of bacteria synthesize extracellular polysaccharides, such as cellulose, which form protective envelopes around the cells. While bacterial cellulose is produced in nature, many methods are currently being investigated to enhance cellulose growth from cultures in laboratories as a large-scale process. By controlling synthesis methods, the resulting microbial cellulose can be tailored to have specific desirable properties. For example, {{attention has been given}} to the bacteria <b>Acetobacter</b> xylinum due to its cellulose’s unique mechanical properties and applications to biotechnology, microbiology, and materials science. Historically, bacterial cellulose has been limited to the manufacture of Nata de coco, a South-East Asian food product. With advances in the ability to synthesize and characterize bacterial cellulose, the material is being used {{for a wide variety of}} commercial applications including textiles, cosmetics, and food products, as well as medical applications. [...] Many patents have been issued in microbial cellulose applications and several active areas of research are attempting to better characterize microbial cellulose and utilize it in new areas.|$|E
2500|$|However, the {{addition}} of excessive amounts of nitrogen can also create a hazard as other organisms besides beneficial wine yeast can utilize the nutrients. These include spoilage organisms such as Brettanomyces, <b>Acetobacter</b> and Lactic acid bacteria from the Lactobacillus and Pediococcus genera. This is why many wineries will measure the YAN after harvest and crushing using one of several methods available today including the nitrogen by o-phthaldialdehyde assay (NOPA) which {{requires the use of}} a spectrometer or the Formol titration method. Knowing the YAN in the must allows winemakers to calculate the right amount of additive needed to get through fermentation, leaving only [...] "nutrient desert" [...] for any spoilage organisms that come afterwards.|$|E
2500|$|Ascorbic acid is {{prepared}} in industry from glucose in a method {{based on the}} historical Reichstein process. [...] In {{the first of a}} five-step process, glucose is catalytically hydrogenated to sorbitol, which is then oxidized by the microorganism <b>Acetobacter</b> suboxydans to sorbose. Only one of the six hydroxy groups is oxidized by this enzymatic reaction. [...] From this point, two routes are available. [...] Treatment of the product with acetone in the presence of an acid catalyst converts four of the remaining hydroxyl groups to acetals. The unprotected hydroxyl group is oxidized to the carboxylic acid by reaction with the catalytic oxidant TEMPO (regenerated by sodium hypochlorite — bleaching solution). Historically, industrial preparation via the Reichstein process used potassium permanganate as the bleaching solution. [...] Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of this product performs the dual function of removing the two acetal groups and ring-closing lactonization. This step yields ascorbic acid. Each of the five steps has a yield larger than 90%.|$|E
2500|$|A {{wine that}} has not been sterilized by {{filtration}} might well still contain live yeast cells and bacteria. If both alcoholic and malolactic fermentation have run to completion, and neither excessive oxygen nor Brettanomyces yeast are present, this ought to cause no problems; modern hygiene has largely eliminated spoilage by bacteria such as <b>acetobacter,</b> which turns wine into vinegar. If there is residual sugar, however, it may undergo secondary fermentation, creating dissolved carbon dioxide as a by-product. When the wine is opened, it will be spritzy or [...] "sparkling". In a wine intended to be still this is regarded as a serious fault; it can even cause the bottle to explode. Similarly, a wine {{that has not}} been put through complete malolactic fermentation may undergo it in bottle, reducing its acidity, generating carbon dioxide, and adding a diacetyl butterscotch aroma. Brettanomyces yeasts add 4-ethylphenol, 4-ethylguaiacol and isovaleric acid horse-sweat aromas. These phenomena may be prevented by sterile filtration, by the addition of relatively large quantities of sulfur dioxide and sometimes sorbic acid, by mixing in alcoholic spirit to give a fortified wine of sufficient strength to kill all yeast and bacteria, or by pasteurization.|$|E
2500|$|The {{structural}} role {{of cellulose}} in cell walls has been likened {{to that of}} the glass strands of fiberglass or to the supporting rods within reinforced concrete. Cellulose fibrils are highly insoluble and inelastic and, because of their molecular configuration, have a tensile strength comparable to that of steel. Consequently, cellulose imparts a unique combination of chemical resilience and mechanical support and flexibility to the tissues in which it resides. [...] Bacterial cellulose, produced by <b>Acetobacter</b> species, displays unique properties, including high mechanical strength, high water absorption capacity, high crystallinity, and an ultra-fine and highly pure fiber network structure. One of the most important features of bacterial cellulose is its chemical purity. In addition to this, bacterial cellulose is stable towards chemicals and at high temperatures. Bacterial cellulose has been suggested to have a construction like a ‘cage' which protects the cell from foreign material and heavy-metal ions, while still allowing nutrients to be supplied easily by diffusion. Bacterial cellulose was described by Louis Pasteur as [...] "a sort of moist skin, swollen, gelatinous and slippery." [...] Although the solid portion in the gel is less than one percent, it is almost pure cellulose containing no lignin and other foreign substances. Although bacterial cellulose is obtained {{in the form of a}} highly swollen gel, the texture is quite unique and different from typical gels. [...] Cellulose has a high swollen fiber network resulting from the presence of pore structures and tunnels within the wet pellicle. Plant cellulose water retention values 60%, while bacterial cellulose has a water retention value of 1000%.|$|E
