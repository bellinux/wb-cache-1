The highest authority would be transferred temporarily to the Cabildo until the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> governing junta. Notices were placed at various points throughout the city, which announced the imminent creation of a junta and the summoning of representatives from the provinces. The notices also called {{for the public to}} refrain from actions contrary to public policy.|$|E

In May 2013, Tom Kyle was appointed the Gliders' new head coach.|$|E

5|$|Arundel {{joined the}} {{opposition}} {{at an early}} point, and {{did not attend the}} Stamford parliament in July 1309, where Gaveston's return was negotiated. After Gaveston returned, his behaviour became even more offensive, and opposition towards him grew. In addition to this, there was great discontent with Edward II's failure to follow up his father's Scottish campaigns. On 16 March 1310, the king had to agree to the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> committee known as the Lords Ordainers, who were {{to be in charge of}} the reform of the royal government. Arundel was one of eight earls among the twenty-one Ordainers.|$|E
5|$|As the 19th century wore on non-conformist ministers {{increasingly}} {{began to}} conduct services within the workhouse, but Catholic priests were rarely welcomed. A variety of legislation {{had been introduced}} during the 17th century to limit {{the civil rights of}} Catholics, beginning with the Popish Recusants Act 1605 {{in the wake of the}} failed Gunpowder Plot that year. But although almost all restrictions on Catholics in England and Ireland were removed by the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, a great deal of anti-Catholic feeling remained. Even in areas with large Catholic populations, such as Liverpool, the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Catholic chaplain was unthinkable. Some guardians went so far as to refuse Catholic priests entry to the workhouse.|$|E

5|$|Despite the splendidly sized new {{building}} (albeit a plain one), the church declined in {{status as the}} college gradually died. It {{is possible that the}} community ceased in 1212, when the Gloucester monks were killed by the locals; we don't know whether they were replaced. Nor do we know whether the clas resumed after Llywelyn the Great retook the area. Community life probably ended with the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rector by King Henry III in 1246, although this latter is not conclusive; a college might be headed by a rector, although they were usually styled provost. There have been suggestions that there were one or more chantry chapels, which could suggest the presence of more than one priest.|$|E
5|$|Heffron's reformist {{attitude}} in education also {{extended to the}} tertiary level, in which he intended to significantly expand NSW's capacity for higher-level learning. On 9 July 1946 he presented a proposal to the cabinet outlining {{the creation of a}} technological-based university in NSW, as a separate institution to the existing Sydney Technical College and a year later cabinet authorised the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Developmental Council, chaired by Heffron, to bring the new tertiary institution into existence. First meeting in August 1947, the council established all the guidelines and regulations that would set-up the future institution and by March 1948, 46 students had already enrolled to study.|$|E
5|$|Historian Katharine Glover {{argues that}} women had less means of public {{participation}} than men {{and that as}} a result piety and an active religious life may have been more important for women from the social elite. Church going played an important part in the lives of many women. Women were largely excluded from the administration of the kirk, but when heads of households voted on the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new minister some parishes allowed women in that position to participate.|$|E

5|$|If the Spanish monarch ever refused in {{conscience}} {{to grant}} royal assent, a procedure {{similar to the}} Belgian handling of King Baudouin's objection {{would not be possible}} under the current constitution. If the sovereign were ever declared incapable of discharging royal authority, his or her powers would not be transferred to the Cabinet, pending the parliamentary <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> regency. Instead, the constitution mandates the next person of age in the line of succession would immediately become regent. Therefore, had Juan Carlos followed the Belgian example in 2005 or 2010, a declaration of incapacity would have transferred power to Felipe, then the heir apparent.|$|E
5|$|In 1911 another Royal Commission {{investigation}} into Fremantle Prison recommended closing the facility. Its report was {{ignored by the}} state government, which was more concerned with building infrastructure such as roads and schools than the plight of its prisoners. However, there was a rapid change in prison policy, with the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> superintendent, Hugh Hann, who had recent English and colonial experience, and {{the election of a}} Labor government with members interested in penal reform. One immediate result was the dismantling of the separate system at Fremantle Prison and the demolition of the separate exercise yards in 1912.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 20th century, a few Roman Catholics were appointed, but {{concerns}} about {{diversity of the}} Court were mainly in terms of geographic diversity, to represent all geographic regions of the country, as opposed to ethnic, religious, or gender diversity. The 20th century saw the first appointment of justices who were Jewish (Louis Brandeis, 1916), African-American (Thurgood Marshall, 1967), female (Sandra Day O'Connor, 1981), and Italian-American (Antonin Scalia, 1986). The 21st century saw the first <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Hispanic justice (Sonia Sotomayor, 2009), if justice Benjamin Cardozo, who was a Sephardi Jew of Portuguese descent and appointed in 1932, is excluded.|$|E
5|$|Protestantism {{was focused}} on the Bible and family worship was {{strongly}} encouraged. The kirk sessions applied personal and moral discipline. They discouraged group celebrations. Sessions had an administrative burden in the system of poor relief, the administration of the parish school system. They also took over the pursuit of witchcraft cases. The most intense hunt was in 1661‚Äì62, but improving economic conditions and increasing scepticism led the practice to peter out {{towards the end of the}} century. The numbers of Roman Catholics and the organisation of the Church probably deteriorated, but began to revive with the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Vicar Apostolic over the mission in 1694.|$|E
5|$|The head of {{government}} is responsible to the National Assembly and serves as the Deputy Chairman of the Council for Defence and Security. Moreover, prime minister is also Chairman of the Council for National Education. The tenure of a prime minister is five years, and the term is renewable once. The current prime minister Nguy·ªÖn Xu√¢n Ph√∫c has served since 2016. In case of incapacity, a deputy prime minister assumes the office of acting prime minister until the prime minister resumes duty, or until the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new prime minister.|$|E
50|$|Although each {{situation}} will vary, {{one of the}} primary reasons for seeking the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interim examiner is to facilitate him commencing his work immediately rather than waiting until after the full hearing. In addition, it is often felt that the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interim examiner offers <b>a</b> certain level <b>of</b> reassurance to creditors and suppliers and to the company's employees who are frequently unaware of the intended application until after it has been made.|$|R

5|$|The {{importance}} of 'joint' warfare {{was made clear}} to the Australian military during World War II when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands. Following the war, several senior officers lobbied for the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{commander in chief of}} the three services. The government rejected this proposal and the three services remained fully independent. The absence of a central authority resulted in poor co-ordination between the services, with each service organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a variety}} of annual events, {{beginning}} with the relatively new New Year's Day Parade, a fireworks display at the London Eye; the world's second largest street party, the Notting Hill Carnival, is held on the late August Bank Holiday each year. Traditional parades include November's Lord Mayor's Show, a centuries-old event celebrating the annual <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new Lord Mayor of the City of London with a procession along {{the streets of the}} City, and June's Trooping the Colour, a formal military pageant performed by regiments of the Commonwealth and British armies to celebrate the Queen's Official Birthday.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the Treaty, Bohemond agreed to become a vassal of the Emperor and to defend the Empire {{whenever}} needed. He also accepted the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Greek Patriarch. In return, he was given the titles of sebastos and doux (duke) of Antioch, and he was guaranteed the right to pass on to his heirs the County of Edessa. Following this, Bohemond retreated to Apulia and died there. His nephew, Tancred, who was regent in Antioch, refused to accept {{the terms of}} the Treaty. Antioch came temporarily under Byzantine sway in 1137, {{but it was not until}} 1158 that it truly became a Byzantine vassal.|$|E
