The procedure, which involved a series of partitioning and column chromatography steps, was performed on 500 g of Mytilus edulis hepatopancreas tissue containing 14 mg of 1. Overall yields of 1 (52 %), 2 (43 %), 3 (43 %), and 6 (38 %) were good, and purities were confirmed by NMR spectroscopy.

5000|$|Our insatiable {{appetite}} for seafood {{of all types}} has led to overfishing and has already significantly strained marine food stocks {{to the point of}} collapse in many cases. With seafood being a major protein source for so much of the population, there are inherent health risks associated with global warming. As mentioned above increased agricultural runoff and warmer water temperature allows for eutrophication of ocean waters. This increased growth of algae and phytoplankton in turn can have dire consequences. These algal blooms can emit toxic substances that can be harmful to humans if consumed. Organisms, such as shellfish, marine crustaceans and even fish, feed on or near these infected blooms, ingest the toxins and can be consumed unknowingly by humans. One of these toxin producing algae is Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta. This species produces a substance called domoic acid which is responsible for amnesic shellfish poisoning. [...] The toxicity of this species has been shown to increase with greater [...] concentrations associated with ocean acidification. [...] Some of the more common illnesses reported from harmful algal blooms include; Ciguatera fish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning, <b>azaspiracid</b> shellfish poisoning, diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning and the above-mentioned amnesic shellfish poisoning.|$|E

The aims of this work were to characterize the toxin profile of the species and gain structural information on <b>azaspiracids</b> produced by the A. dexteroporum strain SZN-B 848 isolated from the Gulf of Naples. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses were carried out on three MS systems having different ion source geometries (ESI, TurboIonSpray®, ESI ION MAX) and different MS analyzers operating either at unit resolution or at high resolution, namely a hybrid triple quadrupole-linear ion trap (Q-trap MS), a time of flight (TOF MS), and a hybrid linear ion trap Orbitrap XL fourier transform mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap XL FTMS). As a combined result of these different analyses, A. dexteroporum showed to produce AZA- 35, previously reported from A. spinosum, and six compounds that represent new additions to the AZA-group of toxins, including AZA- 54 to AZA- 58 and 3 -epiAZA- 7, a stereoisomer of the shellfish metabolite AZA- 7.

Considering {{that none of the}} <b>azaspiracids</b> being produced by the Mediterranean strain of A. dexteroporum is currently regulated by European food safety authorities, monitoring programmes of marine biotoxins in the Mediterranean area should take into account the occurrence of the new analogues to avoid an underestimation of the AZA-related risk for seafood consumers...|$|R

40|$|Azaspiracids are {{a family}} of {{lipophilic}} polyether marine biotoxins that have caused a number of human intoxication incidents in Europe since 1995 following the consumption by consumers of intoxicated shellfish (Mytilus edulis). These azaspiracids have now been identified in mussels (Mytilus chilensis) and scallops (Argopecten purpuratus) from two Chilean locations. This is the first report of the occurrence of <b>azaspiracid</b> toxins in these species (Mytilus chilensis and Argopecten purpuratus) from Chile. The areas studied were Bahı´a Inglesa (III Region, 27 SL) and Chiloe´ Archipelago, both important scallop and mussels farming areas.

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 <b>Azaspiracid</b> has {{generated}} {{an enormous amount}} of scientific interest in the fourteen years since its initial discovery. The structure contains a 6, 5, 6 bis-spiroketal, a [3. 3. 1] bicyclic ketal and a 6, 5 -spiroaminal linkage as key moieties. With 9 rings, 20 stereocenters and three alkenes, the <b>azaspiracid</b> immediately attracted the interest of the synthetic community. To date, two syntheses have been reported by the Nicolaou and Evans laboratories. An initial route to the C 13 -C 19 aldehyde was plagued by a problematic 1, 2 silyl migration. An improved route to the C 13 -C 19 aldehyde was developed based on a modified protecting group strategy utilizing a PMP ketal. The improvements in the synthesis led to facile production of 250 mg of the key transoidal ABC ring bisspiroketal. This second generation route dramatically improved the efficiency of our synthesis, with the overall yield for the C 13 -C 19 aldehyde increasing from 2 % to 15 %, which allowed the synthesis of over 250 mg the bisspiroketal. An optimized route to the FGHI spiroaminal was developed. A unique equilibration method for the construction of the anomerically-stabilized spiroaminal was discovered. After cleavage of the Cbz carbamate, an in situ tautomerization provided the desired doubly anomeric FGHI spiroaminal subunit. This transformed a total synthesis of FGHI spiroaminal into a process which could easily produce gram quantities of advanced intermediates requisite for the synthesis of <b>azaspiracid.</b> With an optimized synthesis of the FGHI ring system complete, a host of routes were investigated for the coupling of the C 26 -C 40 fragment and C 20 -C 25 fragment was developed. The C 25 -C 26 bond was formed via an aldol condensation between FGHI methyl ester and the C 20 -C 26 aldehyde. A novel TAS-F-mediated elimination was developed to provide the C 26 -C 44 olefin. The Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons coupling of the C 4 -C 19 lactol and C 20 -C 40 ketophosphonate furnished the contiguous C 4 -C 45 framework of azaspiracid- 1.

With this method 28 different marine lipophilic biotoxins can be analysed in a single run. Separation was achieved with an acetonitrile/water gradient containing ammonium hydroxide (pH 11). All toxins were stable under these basic conditions. Compared to chromatography using an acidic gradient, the limit of detection (LODs) for okadaic acid, yessotoxin, gymnodimine and 13 -desmethyl spirolide C were improved two- to three-fold, mainly due to better peak shapes. The <b>azaspiracids</b> and pectenotoxins- 2 showed comparable LODs under acidic and basic conditions. A major advantage of the developed method is that toxins can be clustered in retention time windows separated for positively and negatively ionized molecular ions.

40|$|<b>Azaspiracids</b> are a {{class of}} {{recently}} discovered algae-derived shellfish toxins. Their distribution globally is on the increase with mussels being most widely implicated in azaspiracid-related food poisoning events. Evidence that these toxins were bound to proteins in contaminated mussels has been shown recently. In the present study characterization of these proteins in blue mussels, Mytilus edulis, was achieved using a range of advanced proteomics tools.

Most severe decreases were observed for domoic acid and yessotoxin, for which the smallest dose of irradiation led to almost complete destruction. For pectenotoxin- 2 the decrease in concentration was less severe but still continuous with increasing dose. Azaspiracid- 1 and okadaic acid were the least affected in solution. In shellfish tissue the decrease in toxin concentrations was much reduced compared with the effect in solution. After irradiation at the highest dose reductions in concentrations were between ca. 5 and 20 % for the lipophilic toxins {{and there was no}} statistical difference between control and irradiated samples for <b>azaspiracids</b> in tissue.
