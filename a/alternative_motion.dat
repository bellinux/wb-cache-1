Perceptual flips were preceded by a significant decrease of EEG frequencies, and followed by a significant frequency increase with a trend to overshoot. EEG slowing is a reliable sign of vigilance decrease and can be related to thalamic deactivation.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade many {{research}} reports have provided evidences, that high-frequency oscillatory (HFO) brain activity is inevitably involved {{in the organization of}} human perception. Especially the contribution of beta- and gamma-oscillations, has been discussed extensively. Thereto researchers often use the bottom-up and top-down-processing dichotomy to characterize electrophysiological activities. Hence this work investigates HFO electrophysiological correlates of multistable perception in an ambiguous visual motion pattern, the stroboscopic <b>alternative</b> <b>motion,</b> in healthy subjects. In a second study correlates of an auditory sustained attention paradigm were investigated in schizophrenics and healthy controls. The results bear several new aspects of the contribution of HFO, especially in the beta-activity range, to the investigated phenomena and underpin the need for new causal experimental approaches to confirm the functional role of these oscillations. The bottom-up top-down-dichotomy did not prove to be helpful as a nomenclature to characterize the underlying oscillatory processes...|$|E

Fourteen 10 -year old children observed an ambiguous pattern, known as the stroboscopic <b>alternative</b> <b>motion</b> (SAM) and were instructed to press a button following each reversal. The results showed the occurrence of a slow positive wave about 100 ms prior to the button-press. The amplitude of the component revealed a strong posterior topography. The positive wave induced by the SAM, did not differ from a slow wave elicited by a stimulus-driven control paradigm, whereas the adult brains strongly differentiate between internal and external generated perception. Moreover, the children seem to be incapable to produce a stable reversal related component over frontal areas, which reflect the yet insufficient integration of these areas into the entire brain work...|$|E

Due to the superposition of rapidly fluctuating <b>alternative</b> <b>motions</b> at both very low temperatures (quantum effects) and very high temperatures (classical Brownian motion regime), {{the dimension of}} an atomic "path" is in reality different from unity. In the intermediate temperature regime and under environmental conditions which sustain active biological functions, the fractal dimension of the sets upon which atoms reside is an open question. Measured values of the fractal dimension of the sets on which the Hydrogen atoms reside within the Azurin protein macromolecule are reported. The distribution of proton positions was measured employing thermal neutron elastic scattering from Azurin protein targets. As the temperature was raised from low to intermediate values, a previously known and biologically relevant dynamical transition was verified for the Azurin protein only under hydrated conditions. The measured fractal dimension of the geometrical sets on which protons reside in the biologically relevant temperature regime is given by D= 0. 65 ± 0. 1. The relationship between fractal dimensionality and biological function is qualitatively discussed. Comment: ReVTeX 4 format with 5 *. eps figure...|$|R

Cu added alloy, TiNi (Cu), transforms into the orthorhombic phase which is called B 19. They transform into monoclinic martensite called BI 9 ' when temperature is further lowered.

For the tests in lubricated conditions a fluid containing {{a large amount of}} sodium hyaluronate has been chosen. By using an electronic precision balance the wear mass loss of the UHMWPE samples was evaluated accordingly. Friction is greatly reduced by the presence of UHMWPE and this is believed to be due to the formation of a lubricating film of UHMWPE in the contact zone. Furthermore, the experimental investigation shows that the AISI 420 C/UHMWPE gives, in dry conditions, better values in the wear rate and in the friction coefficient than the TiAl 6 V 4 /UHMWPE...|$|E

We found that both motion conditions resulted in communication patterns that indicate higher engagement in conversation, more accurate responses to the satellite participant’s deictic questions (i. e., “What do you think?”), and higher user rankings. We also discovered tradeoffs in attention and clarity between explicit versus implicit control, a tension in how motion toward one person can exclude other people, and ways that swiveling motion provides attention awareness, even without direct eye contact...|$|E

40|$|This is an author-created {{version of}} a paper to be {{published}} in the Springer journal Machine Vision and Applications. The published version will be available at www. springerlink. com) Images of cellular structures in growing plant roots acquired using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) have some unusual properties that make motion estimation challenging. These include multiple motions, non-Gaussian noise and large regions with little spatial structure. In this paper, a method for motion estimation is described that uses a robust multi-frame likelihood model and a technique for estimating uncertainty. An efficient region-based matching approach was used followed by a forward projection method. Over small timescales the dynamics are simple (approximately locally constant) and the change in appearance small. Therefore a constant local velocity model is used and the MAP estimate of the joint probability over a set of frames is recovered. Occurrences of multiple modes in the posterior are detected, {{and in the case of}} a single dominant mode, motion is inferred using Laplace’e method. The method was applied to several Arabidopsis thaliana root growth sequences with varying levels of success. In addition, comparative results are given for three <b>alternative</b> <b>motion</b> estimation approaches, the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi tracker, Black and Anandan’s robust smoothing method, and Markov random field based methods. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{valve train}} wear of {{automotive}} diesel engines mainly {{depends on the}} kinematics of the contact, the metallurgy of the rubbing surfaces and the lubricant [1]. The presence of soot in the oil causes {{a dramatic increase in}} wear of the cam/tappet contact [2 - 3]. It has been shown, in this case, that the interactions between the soot particles and the rubbing solid surfaces are very important in the understanding of the wear and lubrication process. These interactions are partially governed by the dispersant polymer in solution in the automotive lubricant. Then, the tribological and the rheological behaviour of the boundary films anchored on to the surfaces must be considered. This paper focusses on the shearing of polymer films inside an elastohydrodynamic contact. The application of low speed <b>alternative</b> <b>motions</b> of the contact with successive periods of pure rolling (vanishing sliding speed) and pure sliding (vanishing entrainment speed) leads to the formation of film accumulations that are always entrained by the lubricant flow. The shearing and the geometry of these aggregates strongly depend on their adherence to the solid surfaces. The agglomeration process is stopped when the adsorbed layers of polymers have been consumed and totally peeled off from the solids. A numerical simulation including the peculiar kinematics of the contact in a pure sliding elastohydrodynamic lubrication regime gives the evolution of the oil film thickness versus time. The results of this model are compared to the experimental results. The consumption and the adherence of these layers to the substrates can be related to the wear process of the valve train...|$|R
