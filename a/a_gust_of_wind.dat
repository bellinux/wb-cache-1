5|$|Most {{species have}} 12 ovules and 36 seeds, {{although}} some {{species such as}} N. bulbocodium have more, up {{to a maximum of}} 60. Seeds take five to six weeks to mature. The seeds of sections Jonquilla and Bulbocodium are wedge-shaped and matte black, while those of other sections are ovate and glossy black. <b>A</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> or contact with a passing animal is sufficient to disperse the mature seeds.|$|E

5|$|Around noon, as {{a result}} of poor {{coordination}} and signaling, the Swedish line unexpectedly turned toward the allied fleet. When the flagship Kronan came about in the maneuver it suddenly heeled over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, the sails were not reefed and the ship leaned over so hard that water flooded in through the lower gunports. As the ship was leaning over, <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> pushed the ship on her side, bringing her masts and sails down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded and ripped the forward section of the starboard side apart. Kronan quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.|$|E

5|$|Swaying {{behaviour}} is practised by highly cryptic {{animals such as}} {{the leafy}} sea dragon and the stick insect Extatosoma tiaratum. These animals resemble vegetation with their coloration, strikingly disruptive body outlines with leaflike appendages, {{and the ability to}} sway effectively like the plants that they mimic. E. tiaratum actively sways back and forth or side to side when disturbed or when there is <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind,</b> with a frequency distribution like foliage rustling in the wind. This behaviour may represent motion crypsis, preventing detection by predators, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification (as something other than prey), or a combination of the two, and has accordingly also been described as a form of motion camouflage.|$|E
5|$|According to the Köppen classification, the British Isles {{experience}} a maritime climate characterised by relatively cool summers and mild winters. Lincolnshire's {{position on the}} east of the Isles allows for a sunnier and warmer climate relative to the national average, and {{it is one of the}} driest counties in the United Kingdom. Although it may vary depending on altitude and proximity to the coast, the mean average temperature for the East of England is approximately 9°C to 10.5°C; the highest temperature recorded in the region was 37.3°C at Cavendish on 10 August 2003. On average, the region experiences 30 days of rainfall in winter and 25 in summer, with 15 days of thunder and 6–8 days of hail per year; on 25 August 2001, hail the size of golf balls were reported in Sleaford and other parts of central Lincolnshire. Wind tends to affect the north and west of the country more than the East, and Lincolnshire tends to receive no more than 2 days of gale per year (where gale is <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> at >34knots, sustained for at least 10 minutes). Despite this, tornadoes form more often in the East of England than elsewhere in the country; Sleaford experienced tornadoes in 2006 and 2012, both of which caused damage to property.|$|E

Seeing as the enemy had the advantage, Don Álvaro took advantage of <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> which gave him the momentum necessary to charge Clamorgan's ship with such force and skill that he managed to sink it. Once he had sunk Clamorgan's ship, Don Álvaro then turned his attentions solely to Hallebarde's ship, which was finally boarded and captured.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{surviving}} myths in which Zephyrus features most prominently is that of Hyacinth. Hyacinth was a very handsome and athletic Spartan prince. Zephyrus {{fell in love with}} him and courted him, and so did Apollo. The two competed for the young man's love, but he chose Apollo, driving Zephyrus mad with jealousy. Later, catching Apollo and Hyacinth throwing a discus, Zephyrus blew <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> at them, striking Hyacinth in the head with the falling discus. When Hyacinth died, Apollo created the hyacinth flower from his blood. Apollo was furious, but Eros protected Zephyrus, as the act was committed in the name of love, on the condition that the wind god served Eros forever.|$|E

25|$|The {{passage from}} Ukraine to China {{was even more}} {{problematic}} than the purchase. In June 2000, Varyag was taken under tow. As the tugboat approached the Bosphorus, Turkey denied permission for the ship to pass through, citing the risk that <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> would turn the ship widthwise and block the entire strait. Varyag spent the next 16 months being towed counterclockwise around the Black Sea, accruing towing charges of $8,500 a day as Chong Lot stopped paying its bills. The tugboat operator compared its fate to the Yellow Fleet that was stuck in the Suez Canal for eight years, and French thrillseekers even landed a helicopter on the ship. Meanwhile, Chinese officials negotiated with Turkey, offering trade and tourism concessions.|$|E
25|$|Commonwealths {{most serious}} {{accident}} {{in terms of}} human cost occurred on the morning of December 19, 1860, about 5am. While waiting for daylight, to pass safely through Hell Gate, a defective plate in Commonwealths steam chimney burst, allowing steam into the starboard fireroom. When the firemen opened the door to make their escape, <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> diverted the steam into a group of passengers on deck. A family of four from Dublin, the Blakes, were all scalded, the mother so badly she was not expected to recover. A young colored waiter who ran out on deck at the same moment was fatally scalded by inhalation. Two other passengers were also scalded. At an inquest held two days later, the cause of the explosion was determined to be corrosion of the steam chimney, and an accidental finding returned.|$|E

25|$|Nobel {{also began}} to adopt a single-hull design, where the ship's hull forms part of its tank structure. In November 1880 he ordered his first single-hulled tanker, the Moses. Within a year, he ordered seven more single-hulled tankers: the Mohammed, Tatarin, Bramah, Spinoza, Socrates, Darwin, Koran, Talmud, and Calmuck. Branobel {{experienced}} {{one of the first}} oil tanker disasters. In 1881 Zoroasters sister-ship, Nordenskjöld, exploded in Baku while taking on kerosene. The pipe carrying the cargo was jerked away from the hold when the ship was hit by <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind.</b> Kerosene then spilled onto the deck and down into the engine room, where mechanics were working in the light of kerosene lanterns. The ship then exploded, killing half the crew. Nobel responded to the disaster by creating a flexible, leakproof loading pipe which was much more resistant to spills.|$|E
25|$|The {{publicity}} surrounding automobile journey {{brought her}} to the attention of Jerome Fanciulli and Glenn Curtiss who agreed to provide her with flying lessons in Hammondsport, New York. She was the only woman to receive instruction directly from Curtiss. He fitted a limiter on the throttle of Scott's airplane to prevent it gaining enough speed to become airborne while she practiced taxiing on her own. On September 6 either the limiter moved or <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> lifted the biplane and she flew to an altitude of forty feet before executing a gentle landing. Her flight was short and possibly unintentional but Scott is credited by the Early Birds of Aviation as the first woman to pilot and solo in an airplane in the United States, although Bessica Medlar Raiche's flight on September 16 was accredited as first by the Aeronautical Society of America at the time.|$|E
25|$|When {{moving through}} areas, the player mostly modifies the {{landscape}} so that new paths can be opened. For example, {{in order to}} reach an isolated area, the player might have to bring down a platform by casting <b>a</b> <b>gust</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind,</b> climb onto the platform, and then return the platform to its original position and jump off. The player is also given tools to help with puzzles. One such tool acts as a reef blower or vacuum cleaner, moving items out of the way or defeating enemies. Some tools or objects must first be created on the controller's touch pad. Here, the player can draw the shape of an object and choose the colours. When finished, the item is then used in the game world wherever it is necessary. One instance of this occurs when the player is asked to create a butterfly design. The butterfly design the player creates can then be seen numerous times throughout each level {{for the rest of the}} game.|$|E
