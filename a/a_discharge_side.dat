50|$|Pumps {{typically}} have an inlet where the fluid enters the pump {{and an outlet}} where the fluid comes out. The inlet location {{is said to be}} at the suction side of the pump. The outlet location is said to be at the <b>discharge</b> <b>side</b> of the pump. Operation of the pump creates suction (a lower pressure) at the suction side so that fluid can enter the pump through the inlet. Pump operation also causes higher pressure at the <b>discharge</b> <b>side</b> by forcing the fluid out at the outlet. There may be pressure sensing devices at the pump's suction and/or <b>discharge</b> <b>sides</b> which control the operation of the pump.

40|$|During its operation, a {{refrigerator}} compressor produces pulsating noise, primarily {{driven by the}} suction and discharge processes. Sound attenuating mufflers need to be designed without any additional pressure drop on both suction and <b>discharge</b> <b>side.</b> An additional pressure drop at the suction and <b>discharge</b> <b>side</b> will lead to lower charging and discharging of the compressor and hence reduces cooling capacity. Since a one dimensional formulation with plane wave assumption to calculate transmission loss is not applicable for small mufflers (ratio of length to diameter is less than 1), a numerical methodology was established and validated using an impedance tube. Detailed three dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were used to further study the pressure drop across the mufflers for a given flow and compressor operating frequency. In the proposed new methodology, the pressure distribution is observed {{as a function of}} frequency and an optimal position of inlet and outlet pipes is decided to improve transmission loss. Mufflers designed with this approach showed better acoustic performance on the suction and <b>discharge</b> <b>side</b> of refrigerator compressor. The effect of various refrigerants on acoustic frequencies is also studied, which would additionally help in tuning the muffler to improve its effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe active {{transport}} of ions across a membrane by an ATP-driven electrogenic ion pump {{is often described}} by an ‘alternate access’ model. The position of the binding site {{is assumed to be}} unchanged as the binding cavity opens alternatively to the uptake and <b>discharge</b> <b>sides</b> of the membrane. The ion binding affinity is higher on the uptake side of the membrane than on the <b>discharge</b> <b>side.</b> This difference in affinities is related to the maximum transport rate and to the efficiency with which ATP hydrolysis is coupled to {{active transport}}. Here we examine the electrostatic contribution to binding affinities, using a simple geometry for a model membrane-protein system, a continuum dielectric approximation, and a numerical method to calculate binding energy {{as a function of the}} binding site location. If the binding site is located asymmetrically, being further from the uptake side of the membrane than from the <b>discharge</b> <b>side,</b> there is <b>a</b> significant difference in binding free energy between the uptake and discharge states. This asymmetry can produce differences in affinities that are consistent with those measured for biological active transport systems. These results may account for the observed asymmetric location of the calcium binding site in the calcium ATPases from sarcoplasmic reticulum and from the plasma membrane. Electrostatic energy differences associated with binding site asymmetry may be a general feature of electrogenic transmembrane ion pumps...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} basic mathematical models used in {{calculation of}} turbulent flows worldwide. We upgraded the PCFLOW 2 D {{program with the}} Smagorinsky model and the k-�Ă turbulence model for unsteady flow. PCFLOW 2 D {{is derived from the}} TEACH program and is written in the Fortran 77 programming language. PCFLOW 2 D is a two-dimensional depth-averaged model which calculates turbulent flow in open channels. It uses finite volume method of Patankar and Spalding to calculate partial differential equations for unsteady flow. We utilised our upgrades on the mathematical model with hybrid numerical scheme to calculate unsteady flow in a laboratory channel with <b>a</b> <b>side</b> <b>discharge</b> and on <b>a</b> kayaking track on the river So. a near Solkan. Both study cases were calculated using the model of constant effective viscosity, the Smagorinsky model and the k-�Ă model and the results were compared. Analysis shows that while the new model works, it has some problems with numerical diffusion. It produces physically realistic results, with insufficient length of recirculation, due to increased numerical diffusion. We attempted to solve the problem by condensing the numerical grid, but were unable to entirely remove the numerical diffusion. We also tested an up-to-date Fortran compiler, PGI Visual Fortran, that compared to the current compiler, reduced computational times by 45...|$|R

Iodine dissociation fraction generated in the <b>side</b> <b>discharge</b> and measured in the laser cavity is up to 50 %. However, the experiments showed that additional iodine dissociation generated in the <b>side</b> <b>discharge</b> only moderately increases laser gain, by 10 - 15 %. Parametric gain optimization by varying main discharge pressure, O 2 and NO fractions in the flow, I 2 flow rate, pulsed discharge frequency, and sustainer discharge power, with the <b>side</b> <b>discharge</b> in operation produces gain up to 0. 08 %/cm. Two parameters that critically affect gain are the energy loading per molecule in the discharge and the NO flow rate controlling the O atom concentration in the flow. In particular, operation at the main discharge pressure of 60 torr results in significantly higher gain than at 100 torr, 0. 080 %/cm vs. 0. 043 %/cm, due to high discharge energy loading per molecule at the lower pressure. Laser output power measured at the gain optimized conditions is 1. 4 W...|$|R
