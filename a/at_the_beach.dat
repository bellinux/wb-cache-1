40|$|In {{order to}} test the habitat {{harshness}} hypothesis (HHH) the reproductive biology of Donax hanleyanus was studied histologically, comparing populations from three beaches with contrasting morphody-namics (dissipative, intermediate and reflective) over 25 months. The reproductive phase of D. hanleyanus was extended <b>at</b> <b>the</b> reflective <b>beach</b> compared to <b>the</b> other two. Males and females from the dissipative and intermediate beaches were significantly smaller and had lower biomass at maturity than those <b>at</b> <b>the</b> reflective <b>beach.</b> Recruits were significantly more abundant and the recruitment period was extended significantly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dissipative <b>beach.</b> Spawning events took place twice each year <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dissipative (early spring and spring-summer) and <b>the</b> intermediate <b>beach</b> (winter and summer), whereas continuous gamete releases were noted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> reflective <b>beach.</b> Size and biomass at first maturity were lower <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dissipative <b>beach,</b> whereas monthly mean abundance of D. hanleyanus was higher <b>at</b> <b>the</b> reflective <b>beach.</b> <b>The</b> gametogenic cycle correlated significantly with sea-surface temperature, relative spermatozoon abundance, condition index, ash-free shell-free dry mass, and mean size and abundance of oocytes, for all three populations. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> population level, many of these reproductive responses to physical variables were opposite to those predicted by th...|$|R
