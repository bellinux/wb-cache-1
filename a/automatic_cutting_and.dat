Production equipments consist of e. g. wood scanner, <b>automatic</b> <b>cutting</b> saws <b>and</b> finger jointing device. The raw material is scanned and the output data from the scanning operation is stored together with data about raw material price, selling price, raw material supplier etc. For manufacturing finger jointed boards, lower class raw material has been used according to standard saw mill grading rules. The grading rule in this case is extended with demands on moisture content and on minimum distance between branch whorls. Dimension of timber in the study is 32 * 175 mm 2 and it is delivered from different Swedish saw mills. Total amount of timber in the study is 5000 m 3. The result shows that raw material with the lowest price is that which gives the highest yield of knot-free boards.
