40|$|Emerging {{financial}} and environmental challenges associated with conventional power sources have increased global interest in consuming unpolluted, {{renewable energy sources}} for irrigation sector. Solar energy may be an attractive choice in this regard due to its strong influence on crop water use and related energy requirement. However, a comprehensive approach for a reliable and economically viable photovoltaic (PV) system design to produce energy from solar source is required to accurately explore its potential. This thesis describes the development and application of a reliability assessment model, identifies a suitable solar irrigation management scheme, and provides guidelines for evaluating economic viability of a solar-powered center pivot irrigation system. The reliability model, written in MATLAB, was developed based on the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) technique in which various sub-models for estimating energy production, energy requirement and energy storage were combined. The model was validated with actual data acquired from the study site located at Outlook, Saskatchewan, Canada and an excellent agreement was found. For example, normalized {{root mean square error}} (NRMSE) for the battery current was found to be 0. 027. Irrigation management strategies (irrigation depth, frequency and timing) were investigated by comparing the PV system sizing requirement for a conventional (25 - 35 mm per application) and for a frequent light irrigation management strategy (5 - 8 mm per application). The results suggest that the PV sizing can be reduced significantly by adopting frequent light irrigations which utilize the power as it is produced during daylight hours, rather than relying on stored energy. The potential of a solar-powered center pivot irrigation system was revealed for three different crops (canola, soybean and table potato) at the site by conducting a detailed economic analysis for the designed PV system. High value crops with moderate water requirements such as table potatoes appeared to be the most feasible choice for the study site. However, the potential may greatly vary for different crops in altered locations due to management, <b>agronomic,</b> <b>climate,</b> social, and economic variations. It can be concluded that a holistic approach described here {{can be used as a}} tool for designing an appropriate PV powered center pivot irrigation system under variable operating and meteorological conditions. Furthermore, its potential can be accurately explored by conducting a detailed economic analysis for a given location, considering different available crop choices...|$|E

40|$|For the {{semiarid}} Sahelian region, climate variability {{is one of}} {{the most}} important risks of food insecurity. Field experimentations as well as crop modeling are helpful tools for the monitoring and the understanding of yields at local scale. However, extrapolation of these methods at a regional scale remains a demanding task. Remote sensing observations appear as a good alternative or addition to existing crop monitoring systems. In this study, a new approach based on the combination of vegetation and thermal indices for rainfed cereal yield assessment in the Sahelian region was investigated. Empirical statistical models were developed between MODIS NDVI and LST variables and the crop model SARRA-H simulated aboveground biomass and harvest index in order to assess each component of the yield equation. The resulting model was successfully applied at the Niamey Square Degree (NSD) site scale with yield estimations close to the official agricultural statistics of Niger for a period of 11 years (2000 – 2011) ($r = 0. 82,;text{p-value} < 0. 05 $). The combined NDVI and LST indices-based model was found to clearly outperform the model based on NDVI alone ($r = 0. 59,;text{p-value} < 0. 10 $). In areas where access to ground measurements is difficult, a simple, robust, and timely satellite-based model combining vegetation and thermal indices from MODIS and calibrated using crop model outputs can be pertinent. In particular, such a model can provide an assessment of the year-to-year yield variability shortly after harvest for regions with <b>agronomic</b> and <b>climate</b> characteristics close to those of the NSD study area.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the extent and}} characteristics of differentiation in the international wheat market. Results indicate {{that the degree of}} differentiation has increased in the last 15 years. A hedonic price function is specified and estimated to examine implicit prices for characteristics and their changes through time. Key words: hedonics, international, quality, wheat. There are many different classes of wheat pro-duced and traded in the world market. Differ-ences among classes are due to either indige-nous or extraneous characteristics. Color, protein level and quality, strength, and hard-ness are all indigenous characteristics. Extra-neous characteristics include grade factors and nonmillable material or impurities. The qual-ity of wheat produced and exported {{has the potential to be}} an important competitive fac-tor in international trade. As the intensity of competition in wheat trade has increased, so has the importance of differentiation of im-portant quality characteristics. One way to measure the extent and characteristics of dif-ferentiation is to examine prices of wheats with different characteristics. The purpose of this paper is to measure the extent of differentiation and values of quality characteristics in the international wheat mar-ket. One empirical statistic simply measures the degree of differentiation in international wheat markets.

Here, the wheat phenology at more than 100 national agro-meteorological experiment stations across China spanning the years 1981 - 2007 was examined. Spatiotemporal changes of wheat phenology and seasonal temperature, as well as the correlations between them were presented. During the investigation period, heading dates advanced significantly at 43 stations from the 108 investigated stations: maturity dates advanced significantly at 41 stations from the 109 investigated stations. Lengths of growing period (from sowing to maturity) and vegetative growing period (from sowing to heading) were significantly reduced at about 30 % of the investigated stations, especially for spring wheat in northwestern China, despite thermal accumulation during the periods increased. In contrast, although significantly and negatively related to mean temperature, lengths of reproductive growing period (from heading to maturity) increased at 60 % of the investigated stations, owing to increase in crop cultivars thermal requirements or/and decrease in mean temperature. The results showed that besides the complex influences of <b>agronomic</b> factors, <b>climate</b> change contributed substantially to the shift of wheat phenology.

We applied pine wood chip biochar at 10 and 30 t ha- 1 (B 10, B 30) in a macadamia orchard and measured soil properties, photosynthesis and leaf properties over 2 years (2012 – 2014). Biochar treatments initially reduced soil available nitrogen (N) (NH 4 +-N+NO 3 [...] N), probably due to its absorption effect, and this appeared {{to be responsible for}} the reduction of macadamia leaf photosynthetic capacity following biochar application. However, the effect of biochar on soil available N reversed in 12 months and biochar treatments (especially B 30) generally displayed higher soil available N than the control during the second year. This is mainly caused by the increment of soil NO 3 [...] N in biochar treatments, probably attributable to accelerated nitrification rate and reduced NO 3 - leaching. The effect of biochar on soil available N matched with leaf δ 15 N signature: macadamia leaves were more 15 N depleted in biochar treatments, suggesting better preservation of soil available N. Biochar application also led to higher soil total C and C:N ratio, and the gap between biochar treatments (especially B 30) and the control increased over time. This pattern indicates that biochar increased soil C not only by instantaneous addition of recalcitrant C to soil, but also by promoting plant-to-soil C input in longer term, and this was supported by the observation of higher leaf photosynthetic capacity in B 30 (than the control) {{by the end of the}} experiment. Our results suggest that the influence of biochar on soil and crop could have significant temporal effect and some benefits may exhibit with considerable time lag.

While rice remains the main crop in Cambodia, the production of other crops is undergoing a rapid expansion and will be especially important for the development of those parts of the Kingdom unsuited to lowland rice. We present results from socio-economic surveys carried out in the Battambang, Kampong Cham and Takeo Provinces to identify available resources, management practices and key constraints for emerging upland cropping systems. These are mainly cash crops, so the important issues to consider are profitability, technological and management changes, and household and social issues. The surveys were conducted in the Districts of Kamrieng, Sampov Lun, Rotonak Mondol and Banan in Battambang Province, Chamkar Leu, Ou Reang Ov and Tbong Khmum in Kampong Cham Province, and Tramkak in Takeo Province. Sample sizes were 181 in Battambang and Kampong Cham, and 50 in Takeo. Generally farm families had a male head aged in the mid- 40 s, with 3 to 4 years of schooling. However, there are significant numbers of female farmers among survey respondents. Family size averaged 5 to 6 persons; with 2 to 3 being dependents and levels of off-farm work very low.

In 1990 alone, domestic losses due to climatic constraints amounted to US $ 39. 2 million. Weather aberrations, climatic fluctuations such as El Niño, and the growing concern for their effects on agriculture have stimulated academic, public and policy-level interests on the analysis of the impacts of climate variability on agricultural production systems. This paper is presented to discuss the <b>agronomic</b> impacts of <b>climate</b> variability on rice production in the Philippines. Long-term climate variability influences sowing date, crop duration, crop yield, and the management practices adapted in rice production. Short-term weather episodes can also affect yield by inducing changes in temperature, potential evapotranspiration, and moisture availability. The degree of vulnerability of crops to climate variability depends mainly on the development stage of the crops at the time of weather aberration. The vulnerability and risk of crop production due to weather fluctuations and climate variability can be minimized if future weather variation can be adequately predicted and a suitable process-based ecophysiological crop yield forecasting model can be identified to produce real-time yield forecasts.

Changes of phenological observation were categorized into a no-change model and two change models. The change point and intensity of shifts were subsequently estimated under the selected change model. The experiments were conducted in the cropping regions using the state-level crop progress reports issued by the U. S. Department of Agriculture. The results demonstrated that the planted, silking and mature stages of corn were significantly advanced under the change models; the vegetative period was shortened, and the reproductive and growing seasons were lengthened. The soybean phenological metrics followed a similar trend as that of corn, even though more states tended to change under a change model. The underlying drivers of such abrupt changes may be the confounding effects of crop breeding, <b>agronomic</b> management and <b>climate</b> change. Specific events, such as the adoption of genetically engineered crops in 1996 – 1997, can partly explain the changes in phenology.

40|$|Rice starch {{is one of}} {{the major}} cereal {{starches}} with novel functional properties. Significant progress has been made in recent years on the characterization of rice starches separated from different rice cultivars. Studies have revealed that the molecular structure and functional properties are affected by rice germplasm, isolation procedure, <b>climate,</b> <b>agronomic</b> conditions, and grain development. Morphological studies (microscopy and particle size analysis) have reflected significant differences among rice starch granule shapes (polyhedral, irregular) and in granule size (2 to 7 mu m). Nonwaxy and long-grain rice starches show greater variation in granular size than the waxy starches. Rice starch granules are smaller than other cereal starches with amylose contents varying from virtually amylose-free in waxy to about 35 % in nonwaxy and long-grain rice starches. Amylose content appears to be the major factor controlling almost all physicochemical properties of rice starch due to its influence on pasting, gelatinization, retrogradation, syneresis, and other functional properties. Waxy rice starches have high swelling and solubility parameters, and larger relative crystallinity values than nonwaxy and long-grain starches. However, nonwaxy rice starches have a higher gelatinization temperature than the waxy and long-grain starches. The bland taste, nonallergenicity, and smooth, creamy, and spreadable characteristics of rice starch make it unique and valuable in food and pharmaceutical applications.

One hundred oat samples were collected each year at harvest, together with agronomic details, and analysed for 10 Fusarium mycotoxins. The incidence and concentration of most Fusarium mycotoxins, including deoxynivalenol and zearalenone, were relatively low in oats compared with values previously reported for wheat. HT- 2 toxin (HT 2) and T- 2 toxin (T 2) levels were relatively high with an overall combined (HT 2 +T 2) mean of 450 μg kg- 1 for 2006 - 8. Data were combined with a previous dataset collected from 2002 - 5 {{to determine the effects}} of <b>agronomic</b> practices and <b>climate.</b> There was a negative relationship with late summer rainfall, indicating that drier conditions in July and August resulted in increased HT 2 and T 2 in UK oats. Agronomic factors that impacted upon HT 2 and T 2 in harvested oats were previous crop, cultivation, and variety. Analysis of the previous cropping history showed there was a stepwise increase in HT 2 +T 2 as the cereal intensity of the rotation increased. Variety was an important factor, with higher levels and a wider range detected on winter versus spring varieties. Indicative levels for HT 2 and T 2 in cereals and cereal products were introduced by the EC in 2013. The indicative level for unprocessed oats for human consumption is a combined concentration (HT 2 +T 2) of 1000 μg kg- 1.

Long-term <b>climate</b> variability and yield trends were analyzed using ICRISAT’s weather datasets. On-farm data analysis revealed that majority of farmers’ field soils were deficient in organic carbon, available phosphorous, sulphur, zinc and boron at all the locations studied. Pearl millet grain yield and above ground dry matter was improved significantly with balanced nutrient application (NPK + S + Zn + B) in farmers’ field which were critically deficient in the soil nutrients. Even in comparatively drier years, application of balanced nutrient significantly increased grain yield and aboveground dry matter which provides resilience against drought through enhanced water productivity. Long-term experiments conducted in ICRISAT showed that nitro-gen application increased grain yield and above ground dry matter in pearl millet however seasonal variability had a greater effect on yield than cultivars and applied N. Pearl millet yield was positively associated with August maximum temperature and negatively with seasonal precipitation. September precipitation > 125 mm which coincided with grain filling stage reduced grain yield. Benefit: cost analysis showed that balanced nutrient application of pearl millet is an economically sustainable option across the seasons.

The study uses 20 years (1986 - 2006) of <b>agronomic,</b> hydrologic and <b>climate</b> data collected from 43 well-distributed stations across the plain. Based on the results, wheat accounts for over 40 % of total irrigation water requirement in the plain. Similarly, wheat, maize and cotton together account for 64 % of the total irrigation water requirement. The piedmont regions of Mount Taihang have the highest irrigation requirement due to high percent farm and irrigated land area. The months of April and May have the highest irrigation water requirement, respectively accounting for 18. 1 % and 25. 4 % of average annual irrigation. Spatial and temporal variations in our estimated irrigation water requirement are higher than those in the officially published statistics data.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of impact {{of climate change}} on coconut, a plantation crop, is challenging. However, {{the development of a}} simulation model (InfoCrop-COCONUT) has enabled the process. We present the first simulation analysis of the potential impacts of climate change on coconut productivity in India following two approaches, namely: (i) ‘fixed increase in temperature and CO 2, and (ii) scenarios as per PRECIS (Providing Regional Climates for Impact Studies) – a regional climate model. Impact of changed management on coconut productivity in current as well as in future climates is also assessed. Climate change is projected to increase coconut productivity in western coastal region, Kerala, parts of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra (provided current level of water and management is made available in future climates as well) and also in North-Eastern states, islands of Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep while negative impacts are projected for Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, West Bengal, Gujarat and parts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. On all India basis, even with current management, climate change is projected to increase coconut productivity by 4. 3 % in A 1 B 2030, 1. 9 % in A 1 B 2080, 6. 8 % in A 2 2080 and 5. 7 % in B 2 2080 scenarios of PRECIS over mean productivity of 2000 – 2005 period. Agronomic adaptations like soil moisture conservation, summer irrigation, drip irrigation, and fertilizer application cannot only minimize losses in majority of coconut growing regions, but also improve productivity substantially. Further, genetic adaptation measures like growing improved local Tall cultivars and hybrids under improved crop management is needed for long-term adaptation of plantation to climate change, particularly in regions that are projected to be negatively impacted by climate change. Such strategy can increase the productivity by about 33 % in 2030, and by 25 – 32 % in 2080 climate scenarios. In fact, productivity can be improved by 20 % to almost double if all plantations in India are provided with above mentioned management even in current climates. In places where positive impacts are projected, current poor management may become a limiting factor in reaping the benefits of CO 2 fertilization, while in negatively affected regions adaptation strategies can reduce the impacts. Thus, intensive genetic and <b>agronomic</b> adaptation to <b>climate</b> change can substantially benefit the coconut production in India...|$|R
40|$|Societal {{concern is}} growing about the {{consequences}} of climate change for food systems and, in a number of regions, for food security. There is also concern that meeting the rising demand for food is leading to environmental degradation thereby exacerbating factors in part responsible for climate change, and further undermining the food systems upon which food security is based. A major emphasis of climate change/food security research over recent years has addressed the <b>agronomic</b> aspects of <b>climate</b> change, and particularly crop yield. This has provided an excellent foundation for assessments of how climate change may affect crop productivity, but the connectivity between these results and the broader issues of food security at large are relatively poorly explored; too often discussions of food security policy appear to be based on a relatively narrow agronomic perspective. To overcome the limitation of current agronomic research outputs there are several scientific challenges where further agronomic effort is necessary, and where agronomic research results can effectively contribute to the broader issues underlying food security. First is the need to better understand how climate change will affect cropping systems including both direct effects on the crops themselves and indirect effects as a result of changed pest and weed dynamics and altered soil and water conditions. Second is the need to assess technical and policy options for either reducing the deleterious impacts or enhancing the benefits of climate change on cropping systems while minimising further environmental degradation. Third is the need to understand how best to address the information needs of policy makers and report and communicate agronomic research results in a manner that will assist the development of food systems adapted to climate change. There are, however, two important considerations regarding these agronomic research contributions to the food security/climate change debate. The first concerns scale. Agronomic research has traditionally been conducted at plot scale over a growing season or perhaps a few years, but many of the issues related to food security operate at larger spatial and temporal scales. Over the last decade, agronomists have begun to establish trials at landscape scale, but {{there are a number of}} methodological challenges to be overcome at such scales. The second concerns the position of crop production (which is a primary focus of agronomic research) in the broader context of food security. Production is clearly important, but food distribution and exchange also determine food availability while access to food and food utilisation are other important components of food security. Therefore, while agronomic research alone cannot address all food security/climate change issues (and hence the balance of investment in research and development for crop production vis à vis other aspects of food security needs to be assessed), it will nevertheless continue to have an important role to play: it both improves understanding of the impacts of climate change on crop production and helps to develop adaptation options; and also – and crucially – it improves understanding of the consequences of different adaptation options on further climate forcing. This role can further be strengthened if agronomists work alongside other scientists to develop adaptation options that are not only effective in terms of crop production, but are also environmentally and economically robust, at landscape and regional scales. Furthermore, such integrated approaches to adaptation research are much more likely to address the information need of policy makers. The potential for stronger linkages between the results of agronomic research in the context of climate change and the policy environment will thus be enhanced...|$|R
40|$|In view of {{the poor}} {{bread-making}} quality of the wheat grown in The Netherlands, {{only a small part}} of production is used for baking of bread. Therefore quality improvement is a major aim of plant breeding. Unfortunately, breeding for breadmaking quality is hampered by its complexity. The suitability of wheat flour for the manufacture of bread depends on the composition of a large number of kernel components, such as lipids, starch and proteins, and this kernel composition in turn depends on <b>agronomic</b> measures, <b>climate</b> and on the genetic make-up of the varieties. Moreover the suitability of wheat flour for the baking of bread depends on technological conditions, such as those in milling and in the baking process. Another drawback in breeding for improved bread-making quality is the lack of simple and fast techniques to assess bread-making quality. Dough and baking- tests, which take much labour and time are required to determine such characteristics as dough strength and elasticity, loaf volume and crumb structure. Plant breeders in various countries have been aware that the kernel proteins play a major role in determining the bread-making quality. The total amount of kernel proteins, which is largely determined by environment and as such difficult to change by breeding, is positively correlated with the bread-making quality. More useful characteristics for breeding are the genetically determined differences in protein quality, which result in differences in bread-making quality at a given amount of protein, i. e. in differences in the ratio between loaf volume and protein content. Small-scale tests to estimate protein quality (e. g. the SDS sedimentation, the Pelshenke dough-ball or the residue-protein tests) have been used in breeding programmes to predict bread-making quality. However the results of these tests not only depend on the genotype but also reflect environmental conditions. After the development of biochemical techniques for separation of proteins, bread-making quality has been related to the composition of kernel proteins. Because protein composition is genetically determined, it has been proposed as a tool in breeding for bread- making quality. In this thesis the bread-making quality of wheat was studied in relation to differences in type and amount of the various high molecular weight glutenin (HNWg) subunits. These storage proteins are encoded by genes at three homoeologous loci (Glu- 1 loci: Glu-A 1 , Glu-B 1 and Glu-D 1 ); at each locus several alleles occur that differ in type or number (0 - 2) of subunits encoded. At the start of this study, the relation between variation in the HMWg subunit genotype and breadmaking quality has been studied extensively by various research groups. These studies revealed the occurrence of alleles that differ in their contribution to breadmaking quality. In fact, a large part of the variation in bread-making quality was ascribed to variation in the HMWg genotype. Though it was known that variation in type of the HMWg subunits also affects the quality of wheat grown in The Netherlands, it was not known to what extent differences in bread- making quality can be ascribed to differences in the HMWg subunit genotype. Two general aspects for breeding for bread-making quality required further research: 1) the difficulties which may occur in the identification of the HMWg subunit alleles 2) the variation in amount of the HMWg subunits on which aspect very little information was available. Variation in the amounts of groups of kernel proteins, such as the gliadins and the glutenins, is of prime importance for bread-making quality (Chapter 1). Therefore, it was worthwhile studying whether genetic variation in the amounts of the HMWg subunits could also be used in breeding for bread-making quality. Variation in the amounts of the subunits is probably also important for other applications of wheat in which gluten characteristics are important, such as the manufacture of pastas and pastry. Another reason for studying the HMWg subunits quantitatively is that the cause of the 'differences' in quality of HMWg alleles is not known. Differences in the structure of the subunits (the intrinsic quality of the subunits) have beensuggested, but also differences in the level of gene expression (the quantity of the subunits) could be responsible for the differences in quality between the alleles. Therefore a major aim was to study the variation in amount of individual HMWgsubunits and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this variation. Chapter 2 shows that variation in the HMWg genotype does have a large effect on bread-making quality of wheat lines grown in The Netherlands. These lines represent a wide genetic background and can be considered to be random lines with respect to bread- making quality. A baking test developed in The Netherlands was used to determine quality. In general, the ranking of the alleles for quality was in agreement with the ranking found in studies in other countries. Because different baking tests and different criteria for quality were used in the various studies, the relationship found can be considered as generally valid. Most important is the variation at the glu-D 1 locus. The allele encoding the subunits 5 + 10 is related to a higher bread- making quality than its allelic counterpart encoding 2 + 12. In the literature, it is generally assumed that the effect of allelic variation at the 3 homoeologous (Glu- 1 loci on quality is additive. The so-called scoring systems to screen lines for bread-making quality are based on this assumption. However this study shows that interactions between homoeologous loci do occur: an effect of allelic variation at the Glu-A 1 and Glu-B 1 loci was present only in combination with the 'high-quality' glu-D 1 allele encoding the subunits 5 + 10. The mechanisms underlying these interactions are not known. At this point, it should be noted that in Dutch wheat varieties, 'poor quality' alleles predominate at each of the three (Glu- 1 loci (Chapter 7). Therefore it is important to introduce 'high-quality alleles' into Dutch breeding programmes, in particular the glu-D 1 allele encoding 5 + 10. About 20 % of the variation in the breeding lines was ascribed to differences in HMWg genotype, which is much lower than in some of the other published studies. The remainder of the variation in bread-making quality was ascribed to variation in environmental conditions and to genetic variation in the composition of other kernel components, such as lipids, starch, gliadins and low molecular weight glutenin subunits. Therefore, genetic variation in other kernel components should also be taken into consideration when selecting for bread-making quality, although the HMWg subunit genes can be considered as major genes in determining that quality. Which of these other components is most important in this respect is not known. A large number of HMWg alleles are present in varieties and in species related to bread-wheat. Because the contribution to quality is known for only a small number of these alleles, there could be alleles with an unknown 'quality' in breeding programmes. Unintended introduction of 'poor-quality' alleles can be avoided as far as these alleles can be distinguished from 'high-quality' ones. The HMWg alleles are routinely identified by determining the relative mobility (R m) with one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of the subunits encoded. As shown in Chapter 3, the resolution of this technique may be insufficient for an unambiguous identification because alleles may be present that differ only slightly in the R m of the subunits encoded. Unambiguous identification by two-dimensional electrophoresis is especially necessary before introducing species related to bread-wheat in breeding programmes. To study variation in the amount of the HMWg subunits effectively, one must develop a method for a reliable quantification of the subunits present in the kernel. Since one of the objectives was to investigate the amounts of the subunits encoded by different alleles and because a genotype may possess 'poor-quality' alleles in combination with 'high-quality' alleles, one must use a method that allows the quantification and identification of each subunit. In most methods described in the literature, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) is used to separate the HMWg subunits. However the sample preparation required before RP-HPLC is a potential source of error and may even result in systematic losses of the HMWg subunits, as discussed in Chapter 4. In addition, these methods require electrophoretic analysis to identify the HMWg subunits present in the RP-HPLC peaks. As an alternative, an efficient method was developed and is described in Chapter 4. The HMWg subunits are separated from other kernel proteins - and from each other - by SDS-PAGE. Scanning densitometry is used to determine the amount of Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) adsorbed by the protein after get staining, which is a measure for the amount of protein. The routine method for gel staining resulted in subunit bands with a low staining intensity. So it was essential to introduce a new and more sensitive staining method. Since sample preparation is not required in the method, systematic losses of the HMWg subunits can be avoided. Because the identification of the subunits is based on their R m during SDS-PAGE, the method allows quantification and identification of the subunits in one analysis. As shown in Chapter 5, the amount of individual (HNWg) subunits is subject to environmental variation. An increase in nitrogen fertilizer applied to two varieties (Obelisk and Urban), grown at the same trial field, resulted in an increase in both the total amount of kernel proteins and the amounts of all HMWg subunits. Variation in protein content accounted for 88 % and 87 % of the variation, respectively, in|$|R
