50|$|Atom lasers are {{critical}} for atom holography. Similar to conventional holography, atom holography uses the diffraction of atoms.

Atom holography might be used to project complex integrated-circuit patterns, just a few nanometres in scale, onto semiconductors.Another application, which might also benefit from atom lasers, is atom interferometry. In an <b>atom</b> <b>interferometer</b> an atomic wave packet is coherently split into two wave packets that follow different paths before recombining. Atom interferometers, which can be more sensitive than optical interferometers, could be used to test quantum theory, and have such high precision that they may even be able to detect changes in space-time. This is because the de Broglie wavelength of the atoms is much smaller than the wavelength of light, the atoms have mass, and because the internal structure of the atom can also be exploited.|$|E

40|$|<b>Atom</b> <b>interferometers</b> {{allow the}} {{measurement}} of the acceleration of freely falling atoms with respect to an experimental platform at rest on Earth's surface. Such experiments {{have been used to}} test the universality of free fall by comparing the acceleration of the atoms to that of a classical freely falling object. In a recent paper, Müller, Peters and Chu [Nature 463, 926 - 929 (2010) ] argued that <b>atom</b> <b>interferometers</b> also provide a very accurate test of the gravitational redshift when considering the atom as a clock operating at the Compton frequency associated with the rest mass. We analyze this claim in the frame of general relativity and of different alternative theories. We show that the difference of "Compton phases" between the two paths of the interferometer is actually zero in a large class of theories, including general relativity, all metric theories of gravity, most non-metric theories and most theoretical frameworks used to interpret the violations of the equivalence principle. Therefore, in most plausible theoretical frameworks, there is no redshift effect and <b>atom</b> <b>interferometers</b> only test the universality of free fall. We also show that frameworks in which <b>atom</b> <b>interferometers</b> would test the redshift pose serious problems, such as (i) violation of the Schiff conjecture, (ii) violation of the Feynman path integral formulation of quantum mechanics and of the principle of least action for matter waves, (iii) violation of energy conservation, and more generally (iv) violation of the particle-wave duality in quantum mechanics. Standard quantum mechanics is no longer valid in such frameworks, so that a consistent interpretation of the experiment would require an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics. As such an alternative has not been proposed to date, we conclude that the interpretation of <b>atom</b> <b>interferometers</b> as testing the gravitational redshift is unsound. Comment: 26 pages.

5000|$|Specifically, {{however, the}} Ramsey-Bordé {{interferometer}} is an <b>atom</b> <b>interferometer</b> that uses this four traveling wave geometry and {{the phenomenon of}} atomic recoil. In Bordé's notation, [...] is the ground state and [...] is the excited state. When an atom enters {{any of the four}} interaction zones, the wavefunction of the atom is divided into a superposition of two states, where each state is described by a specific energy and a specific momentum: , where 'α' is either 'a' or 'b' (see Figure 5). The quantum number mα is the number of light momentum quanta [...] that have been exchanged from the initial momentum, where [...] is the wavevector of the laser. This superposition is due to the energy and momentum exchanged between the laser and the atom in the interaction zones during the absorption/emission processes. Because there is initially one atom-wave, after the atom has passed through three zones it is in a superposition of eight different states before it reaches the final interaction zone.|$|E
