Nevertheless, a longstanding inconvenience concerning image datasets is that manually collecting and annotating large-scale diversified datasets from real scenes is time-consuming and prone to error. For that virtual datasets have begun to function as a proxy of real datasets. In this paper, we propose to construct large-scale <b>artificial</b> scenes for <b>traffic</b> vision research and generate a new virtual dataset called "ParallelEye". First of all, the street map data is used to build 3 D scene model of Zhongguancun Area, Beijing. Then, the computer graphics, virtual reality, and rule modeling technologies are utilized to synthesize large-scale, realistic virtual urban traffic scenes, in which the fidelity and geography match the real world well. Furthermore, the Unity 3 D platform is used to render the artificial scenes and generate accurate ground-truth labels, e. g., semantic/instance segmentation, object bounding box, object tracking, optical flow, and depth. The environmental conditions in artificial scenes can be controlled completely. As a result, we present a viable implementation pipeline for constructing large-scale <b>artificial</b> scenes for <b>traffic</b> vision research. The experimental results demonstrate that this pipeline is able to generate photorealistic virtual datasets with low modeling time and high accuracy labeling.

Since, in doing so, we keep the dimensionality of the space of the observables finite, we still obtain a finite tensor-based frame-work. Nevertheless, the increased complexity of the model forces the use of tensors of functions whose handling is greatly simpli-fied by extensive z transformation. With this, a systematic procedure is devised to write analytical expressions for the tensors that take into account the joint probability assignments needed to compute any-order expectations.

In this paper we describe {{a model of a}} reactive agent that is used to control a simulated vehicle. The agent is capable of tactical-level driving and has different driving styles. To ensure fast reaction times, the agent’s driving task is divided in several competing and reactive behavior rules. The agent is implemented in and tested with a prototype traffic simulator program. The simulator consists of an urban environment with multi-lane roads, intersections, traffic lights, and vehicles.
