40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{has been}} {{considerable}} investment by health {{authorities in the}} funding of support staff {{whose job is to}} collect data for audit purposes. It is important to understand what costs are involved in such a data collection exercise. The cost advantages of using existing practice staff or externally funded staff are not known. AIM: To assess the cost of transposing data on workload to computer software for audit purposes and retrieving data on five chronic diseases from case records. METHOD: Four <b>audit</b> support <b>staff</b> monitored the time taken to collect specific data as part of a broad audit programme in 12 training practices within one health board area in the West of Scotland in 1997. The time taken was used to estimate comparative costs for using a receptionist or practice nurse for carrying out a similar exercise. RESULTS: Average costs for collecting data per 1000 patients for waiting time, appointments, recall, and telephone audits were 5. 24 Pounds for reception staff, 5. 64 Pounds for <b>audit</b> support <b>staff,</b> and 9. 68 Pounds for a practice nurse. The average cost for collecting data per patient with diabetes, asthma, epilepsy, hypertension, or rheumatoid arthritis was 1. 48 Pounds for reception staff, 1. 60 Pounds for <b>audit</b> support <b>staff,</b> and 2. 74 Pounds for a practice nurse. CONCLUSIONS: The cost of collecting data varies considerably depending on which staff are chosen for the purpose.

50|$|Helmets {{produced}} by FPI at one factory {{were at the}} center of a US Department of Justice lawsuit and $3 million settlement paid by ArmorSource, the prime contractor. The U.S. Attorney's Offices declined to criminally prosecute or file any civil action against FPI staff. The helmets were produced for ArmorSource between 2008 and 2009 and failed to meet standards. The DOJ investigation did not develop any information to indicate military personnel sustained injury or death as a result of the defective ACH helmets. Immediately after FPI leadership became aware of the manufacturing concerns surrounding the ACH helmets, FPI began taking corrective action. FPI recalled its only shipment of Lightweight Helmets for re-inspection, and ensured no Lightweight Helmets manufactured at the factory were sent to the military. The recall of both helmets cost the US Government $19 million. With Defense Contract Management Agency <b>audit</b> <b>staff,</b> FPI identified opportunities to improve its Quality Management System in areas including improved management staff oversight, proper control of quality procedures, training, and implementation of corrective action. FPI implemented new procedures to address these areas, and works continuously to ensure it delivers high quality products and services.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} two aspects of {{internal}} audit quality, namely internal audit competency and internal audit contribution to financial statement audits. Consistent with the substitution view, this study predicts a negative relationship between the competency aspects of internal audit (the tenure {{of the existence of}} internal audit in the organization, internal <b>audit</b> <b>staff</b> expertise in IT and computer skills, training hours, internal <b>audit</b> <b>staff</b> professional certifications in accounting and auditing, and internal <b>audit</b> <b>staff</b> experience in auditing) and audit fees. Second, this study tests whether the contribution of internal auditors to financial statement audit reduces audit fees. The data analysis is based on a cross-sectional regression model with observations of 73 public-listed firms in Malaysia, which include publicly available data matched with survey responses from their internal and external auditors. The results of the study suggest that the competency of internal audit, namely the tenure of the existence of internal audit in the organization, training, internal <b>audit</b> <b>staff</b> prior experience in auditing and accounting, and certifications are associated with lower audit fees. Our findings for both aspects of internal audit quality (competency and internal audit contribution) lend support to the substitution view for explaining the links between internal audit quality and audit fee...|$|E

In addition, a risk framework will provide a high level outline for the way in which an organisation will implement information security risk management and define the roles of the key participants in the process...|$|R

40|$|The study {{examined}} the procedures and guidelines employed in the audit of public sector accounts in line with statutory and professional requirements. It also ascertained {{the extent to which}} accountability, effectiveness and efficiency of audit mechanism are being promoted in Osun state.
