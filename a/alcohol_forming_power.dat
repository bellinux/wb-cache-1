30|$|Using {{conventional}} and high-throughput growth assays, effects of inhibitory hydrolysate compounds on Z. mobilis growth and fermentation {{have been investigated}} (Dong et al. 2013; Franden et al. 2009, 2013; Gu et al. 2015; Yi et al. 2015). The results demonstrated that acetate, furfural, and phenolic aldehydes are three major inhibitors in the dilute acid-pretreated corn stover hydrolysate for Z. mobilis, and the inhibitory activity was strongly correlated to the hydrophobicity of these compounds. Furthermore, combinations of HMF, furfural, and acetate resulted in additive rather than synergistic inhibition to Z. mobilis cell growth (Franden et al. 2013). It was also observed that Z. mobilis is capable of converting aldehydes of furfural, HMF, vanillin, 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde, and syringaldehyde to their corresponding <b>alcohol</b> <b>forms</b> of furfuryl, 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural, vanillyl, 4 -hydroxybenzyl, and syringyl alcohol, respectively (Franden et al. 2013; Yi et al. 2015).
