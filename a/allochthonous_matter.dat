40|$|ABSTRACT Considering the {{importance}} of the riparian vegetation leaves as an energetic source to first order streams, the aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the leaf biomass contribution to the system and its temporal dynamics. With this purpose, monthly samples from July 2008 to June 2009 were collected using four sampling devices installed in three streams, in order to collect the vertical, lateral and terrestrial loads, and the benthic stock. We tested the following hypothesis: (1) leaf biomass input is higher after hydric stress periods; and (2) benthic stock biomass increase with higher loads from vertical and lateral entrances. Leaves represented 71. 9 % (on average) of all sampled <b>allochthonous</b> <b>matter,</b> with seasonal significant variation along the studied year. Peaks of leaf input were registered in September-October, after an increase in rainfall, and also in January, after a decrease in rainfall. Leaf input was higher in the lateral load...|$|E
40|$|Microbial {{metabolic}} {{activity in}} the hypolimnia and sediments of lakes drives the recycling of organic matter both through mineralization {{and the production of}} microbial biomass, which may be utilized by grazers. A correction factor was developed based on the water content of sediment samples that corrects sediment bacteria microscopic counts for masking due to sediment particles. Using this correction factor, it was found that sediment bacterial biomass in 22 lakes was positively related to an indicator of the rate of <b>allochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> input to lakes. However, the total hypolimnetic carbon mineralization rate of lakes, which integrates both sediment and hypolimnetic water column mineralization, was found to be driven mainly by phytoplankton carbon and to occur mainly in the hypolimnetic water column. Indeed, various hypolimnetic and sediment catabolic processes were found to show a strong positive relationship with indicators of autochthonous organic matter standing stocks and production. In no cases were the processes significantly positively correlated with <b>allochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> standing stocks. Results of this research show that autochthonous primary production drives carbon recycling in the hypolimnetic water column, with the ultimate fate of this production being determined principally by the hypolimnetic thickness. The main fate of <b>allochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> in lakes is to become a major component of sediment organic matter where it likely drives a much slower catabolism due to its recalcitrance...|$|R

The fluxes of methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) across air–water interface were measured in a shallow, hypereutrophic, subtropical Lake Donghu (China) over a year cycle, using a static chamber technique. During the year, Lake Donghu emitted CH 4 and CO 2; the average flux of CH 4 and CO 2 was 23. 3 ± 18. 6 and 332. 3 ± 160. 1 mg m? 2 d? 1, respectively. The fluxes of CH 4 and CO 2 showed strong seasonal dynamics: CH 4 emission rate was highest in summer, remaining low in other seasons, whereas CO 2 was adsorbed from the atmosphere in spring and summer, but exhibited a large emission in winter. Annual carbon (C) budget across air–water interface in Lake Donghu was estimated to be 7. 52 ± 4. 07 × 108 g. CH 4 emission was correlated positively with net primary production (NPP) and temperature, whereas CO 2 flux correlated negatively with NPP and temperature; however, there were no significant relationships between the fluxes of CH 4 and CO 2 and dissolved organic carbon, a significant difference from boreal lakes, indicating that phytoplankton rather than <b>allochthonous</b> <b>matter</b> regulated C dynamics across air–water interface of subtropical lake enriched nutrient content. <br/...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{composition and}} origin {{has recently been}} demonstrated to {{play a critical role}} in the persistence of organic matter in lake water, but it is unclear to what degree chemical attributes and sources may also control settling and burial of organic matter in lake sediments. Here we compared the annual contribution of allochthonous and autochthonous sources to the organic matter settling in the water column and present in the sediments of 12 boreal lakes. We used the fluorescence properties and elemental composition of the organic matter to trace its origin and found a consistent pattern of increasing contribution of terrestrial compounds in the sediments as compared to the settling matter, with an annual average allochthony of similar to 87 % and similar to 57 %, respectively. Seasonal data revealed a predominance of in-lake-produced compounds sinking in the water column in summer. Yet only a slight concurrent decrease in the contribution of terrestrial C to lake sediments was observed during the same period, and sediment allochthony increased again to high levels in autumn. Our results reveal a preferential preservation of <b>allochthonous</b> <b>matter</b> in the sediments and highlight the role of lakes as sequesters of organic carbon primarily originating from the surrounding landscape.

40|$|The {{influence}} of inlet bacteria on the assemblage composition of bacterioplankton {{was investigated in}} two Swed-ish forest lakes of different hydraulic retention time. Assemblage composition of the bacteria in lakes and running waters was determined by {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) and sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -amplified 16 S rDNA. The amount of bacterial cells imported via the inlets in relation to bacterio-plankton cells produced in the epilimnion of the lakes was also determined. In the lake with short retention time (theoretical hydraulic retention time of 0. 3 yr) the lake bacterioplankton assemblage largely resembled the riverine assemblages, although the extent of similarity varied among inlets, depending on water flow. In the lake with long retention time (theoretical hydraulic retention time of 10 yr) the bacterioplankton assemblage in the lake had low similarity to the inlet assemblages. The degree of similarity between inlets and lakes was well correlated to the amount of imported cells. Thus, our data suggest that import of inlet bacteria could have a large effect on the composition of lake bacterioplankton assemblages and that hydrological factors determined the magnitude of this effect. Since short hydraulic retention times are very common in lakes in the boreal zone, input of allochthonous bacteria can be one major factor influencing bacterioplankton assemblage composition in boreal lakes.

40|$|Carbon stable isotopic {{composition}} was determined for zooplankton, POM, DOM and, in two cases, phytoplankton from 12 small forest lakes in southern Finland during summer 1997. The lakes {{were selected to}} provide {{a wide range of}} water colour (12 - 365 mg Pt l- 1) but minimum variability in other limnological characteristics. POM and DOM showed similar stable isotope ratios (δ 13 C around - 28 ‰, comparable with values commonly reported for terrestrial C 3 vegetation) and these showed no relationship to water colour. Zooplankton were consistently depleted in 13 C relative to the bulk POM on which they might feed. This relative 13 C depletion increased significantly with water colour. Therefore the zooplankton must have been feeding selectively on isotopically light food sources and doing so to a greater extent in the more humic lakes. Although phytoplankton were 13 C-depleted relative to POM, their abundance and their variability between lakes did not appear to explain adequately the observed trend in zooplankton stable isotope ratios. We propose that some zooplankton were grazing on methanotrophic bacteria which utilise isotopically light methane derived from <b>allochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> decomposed under anaerobic conditions. This process would be more pronounced in coloured lakes with a higher loading of <b>allochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> and greater development of hypolimnetic anoxia...|$|R
30|$|Herbivory is an {{important}} factor regulating the biomass and community structure of benthic algae in streams (Feminella and Hawkins [1995]; Steinman [1996]). Although algal biomass can be effectively reduced by herbivores in a neotropical stream (Barbee [2005]), research on the functional feeding mode of grazers in tropical and subtropical streams is still limited. Not only can they limit algal biomass, but they can also alter the physiognomy and community structure of algae, exerting strong indirect effects within food webs and on nutrient cycling (Holomuzki et al. [2010]). Stream food webs rely primarily on two food sources: autochthonous primary production within the stream and <b>allochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> transferred to the stream as leaf litter, woody debris, and dissolved organic carbon. Autochthonous algae may be more important than <b>allochthonous</b> organic <b>matters</b> to stream consumers in tropical forested headwater streams (March and Pringle [2003]). An open forest canopy can lead to autochthonous algae becoming the dominant food source for herbivores in rainforest streams (Brito et al. [2006]) and tropical Asia (Salas and Dudgeon [2001]; Mantel et al. [2004]; Yam and Dudgeon [2005]; Lin et al. [2012]). Autochthonous algae are the main energy source in some shaded tropical headwater streams (Mantel et al. [2004]; Lau et al. [2008]; [2009]; Li and Dudgeon [2008]). However, few studies have examined the diets of aquatic insects in tropical/subtropical streams (Boyero et al. [2009]).|$|R

40|$|Changes in diatom assemblages, {{geochemistry}} {{and stable}} carbon isotope composition of bulk organic matter in a varved sediment section from Lake Holzmaar, West-Eifel (Germany) {{were used to}} infer mid- to late Holocene climatic changes and human impact from 6340 to 1470 cal yr BP. Shifts in total lacustrine primary production were derived from delta(13) C(org) values. Changes in non-siliceous algae biomass productivity were deduced from accumulation rates of organic matter. Diatom valve accumulation rates and biogenic opal accumulation rates were used as proxies for diatom productivity and for siliceous phytoplankton abundance, respectively. Based on weighted averaging of relative diatom abundance in subsamples, qualitative changes in past trophic status were inferred. Accumulation rates of minerogenic material and the TOC/TN molar ratio permitted the deduction of past changes in <b>allochthonous</b> <b>matter</b> influx. Diatom assemblage composition showed statistically significant changes around 5130, 3660 and 2900 cal yr BP, whereas planktonic diatom productivity was subject to distinct shifts around 5900, 5130, 4500, 3600, 2660 and approximately 1630 cal yr BP, and siliceous phytoplankton biomass changed ca. 6100, 4500, 2660, 1900 and 1700 cal yr BP. Causally determined changes in diatom assemblage composition and productivity, for example, due to shifts in nutrient ratios and/or concentrations invoked by changes in lake circulation patterns, precipitation rates and/or erosion rates are discussed. Glacier fluctuations and lake level changes reported from other study sites in western Europe support the finding that reconstructed lacustrine processes are at least indirectly linked to climate. Palynological and archaeological evidence, however, has shown a strong superimposition of lacustrine processes with local/regional anthropogenic activity since the Iron Age.

However, uncertainties remain {{regarding the use of}} δ 2 H, since {{little is known about the}} potential variation in the amount of exchangeable hydrogen (Hex) among common sample materials or the patterns of δ 2 H when entire food webs are considered. We assessed differences in Hex among the typical sample materials in freshwater studies and used δ 2 H, δ 13 C and δ 15 N to compare their effectiveness in tracing <b>allochthonous</b> <b>matter</b> in food webs of two small temperate lakes. Our results showed higher average amounts of Hex in animal tissues (27 % in fish and macroinvertebrates, 19 % in zooplankton) compared to most plant material (15 % in terrestrial plants and 8 % in seston/periphyton), with the exception of aquatic vascular plants (23 %, referred to as macrophytes). The amount of Hex correlated strongly with sample lipid content (inferred from C:N ratios) in fish and zooplankton samples. Overall, the three isotopes provided good separation of sources (seston, periphyton, macrophytes and allochthonous organic matter), particularly the δ 2 H followed by δ 13 C. Aquatic macrophytes revealed unexpectedly high δ 2 H values, having more elevated δ 2 H values than terrestrial organic matter with direct implications for estimating consumer allochthony. Organic matter from macrophytes significantly contributed to the food webs in both lakes highlighting the need to include macrophytes as a potential source when using stable isotopes to estimate trophic structures and contributions from allochthonous sources...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the seasonal and geographical {{variation in the}} stable carbon isotope ratios of total dissolved inorganic carbon (d 13 C DIC) and suspended matter (d 13 C POC) in the freshwater part of the River Scheldt. Two major sources of particulate organic matter (POM) occur in this riverine system: riverine phytoplankton and terrestrial detritus. In winter the lowest d 13 C DIC values are observed due to enhanced input of CO 2 from decomposition of C- 13 -depleted terrestrial plant detritus (average d 13 C DIC = - 14. 3 parts per thousand). During summer, when litter input from terrestrial flora is the lowest, water column respiration on POM of terrestrial origin is also the lowest as evidenced by less negative d 13 C DIC values (average d 13 C DIC = - 9. 9 parts per thousand). In winter the phytoplankton biomass is low, as indicated by low chlorophyll a concentrations (Chl a - 1), compared to summer when chlorophyll a concentrations can rise {{to a maximum of}} 54 µgl - 1. Furthermore, in winter the very narrow range of d 13 C POC (from - 26. 5 to - 27. 6 parts per thousand) is associated with relatively high C/N ratios (C/N > 9) suggesting that in winter a major fraction of POC is derived from <b>allochthonous</b> <b>matter.</b> In summer d 13 C POC exhibits a very wide range of values, with the most negative values coinciding with high Chl a concentrations and low C/N ratios (C/N 13 C.

40|$|Seasonal {{studies were}} carried out from 21 stations, {{comprising}} of three zones, of Cochin Estuary, to assess the organic matter quality and trophic status. The hydographical parameters showed significant seasonal variations and nutrients and chlorophylls were generally higher during the monsoon season. However, chemical contamination along with the seasonal limitations of light and nitrogen imposed restrictions on the primary production and as a result, mesotrophic conditions generally prevailed in the water column. The nutrient stoichometries and delta C- 13 values of surficial sediments indicated significant allochthonous contribution of organic matter. Irrespective of the higher content of total organic matter, the labile organic matter was very low. Dominance of carbohydrates over lipids and proteins indicated the lower nutritive aspect of the organic matter, and their aged and refractory nature. This, along with higher amount of phytodetritus and the low algal contribution to the biopolymeric carbon corroborated the dominance of <b>allochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> and the heterotrophic nature. The spatial and seasonal variations of labile organic components could effectively substantiate the observed shift in the productivity pattern. An alternative ratio, lipids to tannins and lignins, was proposed to ascertain the relative contribution of <b>allochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> in the estuary. This study confirmed the efficiency of an integrated biogeochemical approach to establish zones with distinct benthic trophic status associated with different degrees of natural and anthropogenic input.

40|$|This article {{considers}} the main {{aspects of the}} process of self-purification in the marine environment. It describes mechanics of biogenic elements of the marine environment in the process of production and destruction of autochthonous and <b>allochthonous</b> organic <b>matter.</b> This article discusses organics and flows of energy, which migrate to the trophic chain of the marine environment in the process of self-purification. And it shows the individual elements {{of the process of}} self-purification in the marine environment and the factors influencing it. In the article it is noted that self-cleaning of water environment happens due to the cycling of matter in the pond. It is emphasized that tension, focus and self-purification completeness are regulated by biotic turnover and energy turnover, which is determined by the type of limnological type of reservoir, geographical features (climate conditions), geophysical and anthropogenic impacts. The article notes that the more diverse system of organisms is, the fuller the compounds’ decay is. This property of organisms to complement each other is called buffering of the system. Complex system of organisms cope better with organic and bacterial contamination, but is less responsive to insertion nutrients; biotic cycle in complex systems is more intense. Bacterial community plays the major role in the process of self-purification of biological marine environments. They are the major element of the coastal zone ecosystems. This article shows that during the growth of bacterial populations most of the energy supplied to the aquatic ecosystems with auto- and <b>allochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> is processed. The bacteria prepare the conditions for the development of other organisms of water biocenosis. Concentration of the organic substrate regulates the growth rate of bacteria.

40|$|Inland waters receive {{substantial}} {{amounts of}} organic carbon from adjacent watersheds. Only {{about half of the}} carbon exported from inland waters reaches the oceans, while the remainder is lost en route. This thesis identifies flocculation as an important and significant fate of carbon in the boreal landscape. Flocculation reallocates organic carbon from the dissolved state into particles which are prone to settle. Thus, flocculation relocates organic carbon from the water column to the sediment. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC), mainly originating from terrestrial sources, in a set of Swedish lakes was found {{to determine the extent of}} sedimentation of particulate organic carbon. A major fraction of the settling particles were of allochthonous origin. This implies that allochthonous DOC was the precursor of the settling matter in these lakes. The gross sedimentation was of the same magnitude as the evasion of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Sunlight, especially in the photosynthetically active region, stimulated flocculation of DOC. The effect of light appeared to involve a direct photochemical reaction. Iron was involved in the flocculation but it could not be unravelled whether the iron catalyzes the flocculation or just co-precipitates with the settling matter. Microbial activity was identified as the main regulator of the flocculation rates. Accordingly, alteration of temperature, oxygen concentration and pH did not affect flocculation only indirectly, via their effects on microbial metabolism. A comparison of fluorescence characteristics of organic matter collected in sediment trap and in the sediment surface layer revealed that autochthonous organic carbon was preferentially lost in the sediments while <b>allochthonous</b> <b>matter</b> increased. The recalcitrant nature of the flocculated matter could favour sequestration of this matter in the lake sediment. Hence, the lakes will act as sinks of organic carbon due to a slower mineralization of the flocculated matter in the sediments...|$|E
40|$|Light {{absorption}} by phytoplankton, non-algal particles (NAP) and chromophoric dissolved {{organic matter}} (CDOM) was investigated at 90 sites of a clear, deep artificial lake (Lake Qiandaohu) to study natural variability of absorption coefficients. Our study shows that CDOM absorption is {{a major contributor to}} the total absorption signal in Lake Qiandaohu during all seasons, except autumn when it has an equivalent contribution as total particle absorption. The exponential slope of CDOM absorption varies within a narrow range around a mean value of 0. 0164 nm− 1 (s d = 0. 00176 nm− 1). Our study finds some evidence for thIS autochthonous production of CDOM in winter and spring. Absorption by phytoplankton, and therefore its contribution to total absorption, is generally greatest in spring, suggesting that phytoplankton growth in Lake Qiandaohu occurs predominantly in the spring. Phytoplankton absorption in freshwater lakes generally has a direct relationship with chlorophyll-a concentration, similar to the one established for open ocean waters. The NAP absorption, whose relative contribution to total absorption is highest in summer, has a spectral shape that can be well fitted by an exponential function with an average slope of 0. 0065 nm− 1 (s d = 0. 00076 nm− 1). There is significant spatial variability present in the summer of Lake Qiandaohu, especially in the northwestern and southwestern extremes where the optical properties of the water column are strongly affected by the presence of <b>allochthonous</b> <b>matter.</b> Variations in the properties of the particle absorption spectra with depths provides evidence that the water column was vertically inhomogeneous and can be monitored with an optical measurement program. Moreover, the optical inhomogeneity in winter is less obvious.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to develop and apply novel climate proxies to {{understand}} the palaeoceanographic evolution of the N. E. Atlantic during the late-Glacial and Holocene. The proxies investigated are based on organic molecular compounds called lipid biomarkers and bulk organic matter properties. The primary focus is on long-chain alkenones, molecules which have been extensively used in mid and low latitude open oceans to reconstruct sea surface temperatures (SSTs) during the Quaternary. Thus, the relative abundance of some alkenones {{is related to the}} growth temperature of the algae {{at the time of the}} biosynthesis of these molecules (expressed in the U(^K) (_ 37) and U(^K) (_ 37) ’ indices). In high latitudes and coastal environments, the temperature dependence of alkenones is controversial, and the potential environmental information from alkenones is not yet well understood. In such locations there is increasing abundance of the C(_ 37 : 4) alkenone (quantified as %C(_ 37 : 4)). The presence of this component has been related to changes in the relative budget of freshwater in the surface ocean. A central {{aim of this}} thesis is to carry out an empirical investigation to find out the key environmental factors that control %C(_ 37 : 4) to assess its potential as a palaeoceanographic proxy. Research was conducted in the Nordic Seas and N. W. Scotland using samples from the water column, surficial sediment and sediment cores. The research undertaken can be broken down in three main sections: Alkenone distributions in the Nordic Seas. The aim was to clarify and extend the application of alkenones as palaeoceanographic proxies in subpolar to polar environments. Samples of filtered sea surface POM were analysed and extremely high %C(_ 37 : 4) values (up to 77 %) were measured in polar waters (up to 80 % sea-ice cover). Values of %C(_ 37 : 4) across the Nordic Seas showed a strong association with water mass type. A combined data-set revealed a stronger correlation of %C(_ 37 : 4) to sea surface salinity' (SSS, R(^ 2) = 0. 72) than to SST (R(^ 2) = 0. 5). However, scatter was observed in the relationship of %C(_ 37 : 4) to SSS, preventing confirmation of %C(_ 37 : 4) as a palaeo-SSS proxy. Values of %C(_ 37 : 4) in sea surface POM were high compared to surficial sediments. We discount preferential degradation of the %C(_ 37 : 4) alkenone and invoke dilution of the %C(_ 37 : 4) signal in sea surface sediments by advected <b>allochthonous</b> <b>matter</b> to explain this. The POM filter data suggest that, overall, U(^K) (_ 37) is a more appropriate SST index for the Nordic Seas than U(^K) (_ 37) '. Examination of the scatter in the U(^K) (_ 37) ' versus SST relationship, shows that regions in the south of the Nordic Seas (including the Icelandic shelf) may yield reliable, alkenone based, palaeoceanographic reconstructions. Comparison of %C(_ 37 : 4) distributions with dinocyst proxies in a late Holocene core from the Barents Sea suggests %C(_ 37 : 4) may be a general marker for the influence of arctic/polar water in palaeoceanographic reconstructions. The palaeoceanography of the Icelandic shelf iox. the post-Glacial period (0 - 15 kyr BP) was reconstructed from alkenone indices measured in three cores collected N and W of Iceland. One of the cores, JR 51 -GC 35, contained a continuous record of Holocene sedimentation spanning 0 - 10. 1 kyr BP. Superimposed on a general Holocene cooling trend in core JR 5 I-GC 35 were millennial scale oscillations of ~ 2 C. The timing of the oscillations was in close agreement with the variability in IRD records from the East Greenland shelf and the timing of glacier advances in northern Iceland. A comparison of the U(^K) (_ 37) -SST records from JR 51 -GC 35 and a published core from the eastern Nordic Seas (MD 952011) showed significant differences (superimposed on the general trend) in the timing of millennial scale climate events. This illustrates that Holocene climate evolution in the Nordic Seas was more complex than previously suggested, with significant climatic differences between the eastern and western Nordic Seas caused by the differential variability of the Irminger and Norwegian Currents with time. The potential application for reconstructing past sea-level changes in NW. Scotland of lipid biomarkers (alkenones, n-alkanes and chlorophyll derivatives), and bulk organic parameters (%TOC, C(_nrg) /N) was assessed by a survey of modern basins (at different stages of isolation from the sea) and fossil basins (with known sea-level histories). A logit regression analysis of all the sediment samples was employed to find which of the biomarkers or bulk organic measurements could reliably characterize the sediment samples in terms of a marine/brackish or isolated/lacustrine origin. The results suggested an excellent efficiency for the alkenone index %C(_ 37 : 4) at predicting the depositional origin of the sediments. This study suggests alkenones could be used as an indicator of sea-level change in fossil isolation basins...|$|E

Upper fouling would work as a filter naturally opposed by environment resistance assimilating and facilitating the accommodation of most organic surplus. In highly hydrodynamic and suffciently deep systems, the transport of organic particles produced from farms would have an eject along the horizontal axis rather than along the vertical axis, involving upper located benthic organisms rather than sedimentary benthic organisms...|$|R
40|$|In aquatic systems, {{dissolved}} {{organic matter}} (DOM) constitutes {{a key component of}} the carbon cycle controlling the transport, speciation, bioavailability and toxicity of trace metals. In this work, we study the spatio-temporal variability of the MO in terms of both quality and quantity from upstream to downstream the Parisian conurbation. Urban discharges which are the main source of <b>allochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> into the Seine at low water periods were also investigated. The DOM collected was fractionated according to polarity criteria into five fractions: hydrophobic, transphilic, hydrophilic acid, hydrophilic basic and hydrophilic neutral. Due to urban discharges a strong enrichment in the hydrophilic (HPI) fraction was observed for downstream sites. This hydrophilic fraction presented stronger binding capacities for copper than hydrophobic fraction from less urbanized site (upstream from Paris) and than Suwannee river fulvic acid (SRFA). Furthermore, biotests highlighted a significant copper bioavailability decrease in presence of hydrophilic DOM...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAquatic hyphomycetes play an {{essential}} role in the decomposition of <b>allochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> which is a fundamental process driving the functioning of forested headwater streams. We studied the effect of anthropogenic acidification on aquatic hyphomycetes associated with decaying leaves of Fagus sylvatica in six forested headwater streams (pH range, 4. 3 - 7. 1). Non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed marked differences in aquatic hyphomycete assemblages between acidified and reference streams. We found strong relationships between aquatic hyphomycete richness and mean Al concentration (r = - 0. 998, p < 0. 0001) and mean pH (r = 0. 962, p < 0. 002), meaning that fungal diversity was severely depleted in acidified streams. By contrast, mean fungal biomass was not related to acidity. Leaf breakdown rate was drastically reduced under acidic conditions raising the issue of whether the functioning of headwater ecosystems could be impaired by a loss of aquatic hyphomycete species...|$|R
40|$|Nutrient cycling is an {{important}} characteristic of all ecosystems, including streams. Nutrients often limit the growth rates of stream algae and heterotrophic microbes and the decomposition rate of <b>allochthonous</b> organic <b>matter.</b> Nutrient uptake (S{sub W}), defined as the mean distance traveled by a nutrient atom dissolved in stream water before uptake by biota is often used as an index of nutrient cycling in streams. It is often overlooked, however, that S{sub W} is not a measure of nutrient uptake rate per se, but rather {{a measure of the}} efficiency with which a stream utilizes the available nutrient supply. The ideal method for measuring S{sub W} involves short-term addition of a nutrient tracer. Regulatory constraints often preclude use of nutrient radiotracers in field studies and methodological difficulties and high analytical costs have previously hindered the use of stable isotope nutrient tracers (e. g., {sup 15 }N). Short-term nutrient enrichments are an alternative to nutrient tracer additions for measuring S{sub W}...|$|R
40|$|Macrobrachium amazonicum is {{the most}} {{frequently}} consumed freshwater crustacean by river communities of the Amazon. Despite its relative abundance and vast knowledge on the species from data on cultivated specimens, little is known regarding its biology in the natural environment, especially its use of creeks that are strongly influenced by the tide. Specimens of Macrobrachium amazonicum were collected in September 2006 (dry season) and March 2007 (rainy season) from two perennial creeks of the Guajará Bay {{in the state of}} Pará (northern Brazil), using traps similar to the matapis used by local fishermen to identify the spatial distribution of the species. Shrimps of all sizes use the tidal creeks in both seasons, including for breeding purposes. The greatest abundance of the species occurred in headwater areas and in the dry season. It is suggested that abundant <b>allochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> and the preference for protected areas may explain the abundance and breeding activity of this species in the headwaters of the creeks...|$|R
40|$|Diel {{dissolved}} oxygen (DO) data {{were used to}} characterize seasonal, inter-annual, and longitudinal variation in production and respiration for the James River Estuary. Two computational methods (Bayesian and bookkeeping) were applied to these data to determine whether inferences regarding DO metabolism are sensitive to methodology. Net metabolism was sensitive to methodology as Bayesian results indicated net heterotrophy (production 3 ̆c respiration) while bookkeeping results indicated net autotrophy (production 3 ̆e respiration). Differences in net metabolism among the methods was due to low seasonal variation in respiration using the Bayesian method, whereas bookkeeping results showed {{a strong correlation between}} production and respiration. Bayesian results suggest a dependence on <b>allochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> (OM) whereas bookkeeping results suggest that metabolism is dependent on autochthonous OM. This study highlights the importance in considering the method used to derive metabolic estimates as it can impact the assessment of trophic status and sources of OM supporting an estuary...|$|R
40|$|During the {{extension}} of Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Leg 76 a new and previously unpenetrated lithological unit composed mainly of claystones was cored above basalt basement at Site 534 in the Blake-Bahama Basin. The Callovian {{part of the new}} unit contains interbedded 'black shales' which were hitherto unexpected {{in this part of the}} section. This Paper presents a brief palynological examination of lithofacies-kerogen relationships in these sediments and shows that their organic content is almost entirely a function of the re-deposition of terrestial and marine organic matter versus the ambient redox conditions of the depositional environment. <b>Allochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> inputs are highest in the interbedded turbidites and decline progressively toward the pelagic black shales in which marine organic matter is comparatively well preserved. The significance of various kerogen and palynomorph indices are discussed. The study emphasizes the absolute necessity for sedimentologically-aware sampling in all palynological and geochemical work on lithologically heterogeneous sequences...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Climate {{change is}} likely to have large effects on the Baltic Sea ecosystem. Simulations {{indicate}} 2 – 4 C warming and 50 – 80 % decrease in ice cover by 2100. Precipitation may increase * 30 % in the north, causing increased land runoff of <b>allochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> (AOM) and organic pollutants and decreased salinity. Coupled physical–biogeochemical models indicate that, in the south, bottom-water anoxia may spread, reducing cod recruitment and increasing sediment phosphorus release, thus promoting cyanobacterial blooms. In the north, heterotrophic bacteria will be favored by AOM, while phytoplankton production may be reduced. Extra trophic levels in the food web may increase energy losses and consequently reduce fish production. Future management of the Baltic Sea must consider the effects of climate change on the ecosystem dynamics and functions, as well as the effects of anthropogenic nutrient and pollutant load. Monitoring should have a holistic approach, encompassing both autotrophic (phytoplankton) and heterotrophic (e. g., bacterial) processes...|$|R

Microbiol. 65 : 3834 – 3842, 1999) we described spatiotemporal {{changes in the}} bacterial community structure at a shallow-water hydrothermal vent in the Aegean Sea near the isle of Milos (Greece). Here we describe identification and phylogenetic analysis of the predominant bacterial populations at the vent site and their distribution at the vent site as determined by sequencing of DNA molecules (bands) excised from denaturing gradient gels. A total of 36 bands could be sequenced, and there were representatives of eight major lineages of the domain Bacteria. Cytophaga-Flavobacterium and Acidobacterium were the most frequently retrieved bacterial groups. Less than 33 % of the sequences exhibited 90 % or more identity with cultivated organisms. The predominance of putative heterotrophic populations in the sequences retrieved is explained by the input of <b>allochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> at the vent site...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} centennial-scale warming event between 8600 and 8400 cal BP from Amery Oasis, East Antarctica, that is {{documented}} by the geochemical record in a lacustrine sediment sequence. The organic carbon content, the C/S ratio, and the sedimentation rate in this core have distinctly elevated values around 8500 y ago reflecting relatively warm and ice-free conditions {{that led to}} well-ventilated conditions in the lake and considerable sedimentation of both autochthonous and <b>allochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> on the lake bottom. This abrupt warming event occurred concurrently with reported warm climatic conditions in the Southern Ocean while the climate in central East Antarctic remained cold. The comparison of the spatial and temporal variability of warm climatic periods documented in various terrestrial, marine, and glacial archives from East Antarctica elucidates {{the uniqueness of the}} centennial-scale warming event in the Amery Oasis. We also discuss a possible correlation of the Amery warming event with the abrupt climatic deterioration around 8200 cal BP on the Northern Hemisphere. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a review of}} recent (≤ 10 years) {{information}} on litterfall, standing stock of benthic organic matter, breakdown rates, and fungal colonization of organic matter in streams. In some cases, recent research reinforces the findings of classic reference papers. In other cases, the additional knowledge provided by recent research introduces a higher variation in the processes analyzed. In many aspects, especially those concerning stream organic matter, the review is biased towards the temperate North American streams, reflecting {{the fact that most}} research was carried out there. However, during the 1990 s European studies increased enormously, especially those related with instream processes, such as leaf litter decomposition. The first part of this review analyzes the origin of <b>allochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> to streams (litterfall, retention, and storage), and it provides data on the amounts estimated in different streams and on the methodology used in the studies. The second part analyzes the fate of detritus in streams: mechanisms of leaf breakdown, relative importance of fungi and bacteria, factors affecting the activity of microbial decomposers, and chemica...|$|R
40|$|Sterols were {{analyzed}} in suspended particles collected in January 1991 in the Solo River system {{and in the}} Serayu River, Java, Indonesia. Free sterols were extracted from particles larger than 0. 7 mu m and analyzed, after derivatization into their trimethylsilyl esters, by GC and GC/MS. Concentrations of total sterols ranged from 438 to 7922 ng/l, or from 2. 4 to 183. 8 ng/mg of total suspended matter, which varied from 3. 3 to 400 and 471 mg/l, respectively in the Serayu River and at the downstream station in the Solo River. POC concentrations also varied in a wide range, from 0. 91 to 4. 72 and 6. 13 % of TSM, respectively at the above stations, and were associated with sterol/POC values ranging from 0. 15 to 1. 75 mu g/mg. Eleven structures of C- 27, C- 28 and C- 29 stenols and associated stanols were identified. 28 Delta(5, 22) was only found at downstream stations in the Solo River and in the Serayu River. This unique distribution, {{different from that of}} other C- 27, C- 28 and C- 29 sterols, suggests a predominantly autochthonous origin for these compounds associated with an increased planktonic biosynthesis near the estuary. Concentrations of 28 Delta(5), 29 Delta(5, 22) and 29 Delta(5) showed similar spatial distributions and increased downstream, reflecting the significant accumulation of organic matter originating from the vegetation of the various drainage basins. Values of the autochthonous versus terrigenous sterol index, defined as 27 Delta(5) / 29 Delta(5, 22) + 29 Delta(5) were in the 1. 4 - 1. 9 range at upstream stations, whereas at downstream stations lower values were found, 0. 4 - 0. 6, which also corresponded to higher concentrations of TSM and lower POC values. Insofar as the stanol/stenol values can be used to estimate the bacterial activity of oxic waters, simultaneous variations of C- 27 and C- 29 stenol/stanol pairs suggest rather different bacterial degradation capacities of autochthonous versus <b>allochthonous</b> organic <b>matter.</b> The wide differencies between the values of the stenol/stanol pairs observed in one of the main tributaries and in downstream stations of the Solo River is evidence that <b>allochthonous</b> organic <b>matter</b> is much more resistant than autochthonous matter. The low index value observed in the Serayu River indicates the highly refractory nature of both autochthonous and allochthonous organic material...|$|R
