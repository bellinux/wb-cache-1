5000|$|Independent Voter Research was {{the name}} of a fictitious company run by the 2012 Romney presidential campaign. An <b>automated</b> <b>calling</b> <b>system</b> {{connected}} MyMitt political volunteers to people who were most likely to be independent voters. The system obscured the volunteers' phone numbers to allow the caller to remain anonymous (the number displayed is either 6513195921 or 8665403140). The volunteer read a script and asked a few questions about the election. Unanswered calls received a voice message. Returning the call produced a recorded message: “Thank you for contacting Independent Voter Research. We’re sorry to have missed you. We were trying to reach you to get your opinion. Have a nice day.” ...|$|E
50|$|Substitute {{teachers}} {{find jobs}} by first completing the application and interview process from their local school district. Once approved, they will either be {{enrolled in an}} <b>automated</b> <b>calling</b> <b>system</b> or more currently, via a system that uses the internet to post available substitute teaching assignments. Substitutes can also find work by contacting private schools in their district. Most substitute teachers in the U.S. can be assigned to work in all academic subject areas as needed (except for long-term substituting assignments). The substitute is generally responsible for closely following and continuing with the lesson plans left by the teacher, and to maintain student order and productivity. As with locum tenens physicians, {{the idea is that}} continuity exists between the work done by the substitute and that done by the other professional. Substitutes work with the same students as the regular teacher does. Substitute teachers can often work in multiple schools within one district, as well as for multiple school districts.|$|E

40|$|This {{retrospective}} study reports {{the outcome of}} a mass casualty incident (MCI) caused by a fire in a nursing home. Data from the medical charts and registration system of the Major Incident Hospital (MIH) and ambulance service were analyzed. The evaluation reports from the MIH and an independent research institute were used. The protocol for reports from major accidents and disaster was used to standardize the reporting [Lennquist, in Int J Disaster Med 1 (1) : 79 - 86, 2003]. The emergency services were quickly at the scene. The different levels of pre-hospital management performed a tight coordination. However, miscommunication led to confusion in the registration and tracking of patients. In total, 49 persons needed medical treatment, 46 were treated in the MIH. Because of (possible) inhalation injury nine patients needed mechanical ventilation and nine patients were hospitalized to exclude delayed onset of pulmonary symptoms. No incident related deaths occurred. The intensive care unit of the MIH was initially understaffed despite the efforts of the <b>automated</b> <b>calling</b> <b>system</b> and switchboard operators. The handwritten registration of incoming staff was incomplete and should be performed digitally. Some staff members were unfamiliar with the MIH procedures. The medical chart appeared too extensive. Miscommunication between chain partners resulted in the delayed sharing of (semi) medical information. The different levels of incident managers performed a tight coordination. The MIH demonstrated its potency to provide emergency care for 46 patients and 9 intubated patients. No deaths or persistent disabilities occurred. Areas of improvement were recognized both in the pre-hospital as the hospital phase...|$|E

New <b>automated</b> <b>calling</b> <b>systems</b> allow the <b>automated</b> notification of parents {{when a child is}} not marked present in the computer, and truancy records for many states are available for inspection online. In large schools where law enforcement officers are present, the fine for [...] "playing hooky" [...] can range from $250 to as much as $500. About 12,000 students were ticketed for truancy in 2008 in Los Angeles. Many states provide for the appointment of local truancy officers who have the authority to arrest habitually truant youths and bring them to their parents or to the school they are supposed to attend. Many states also have the power to revoke a student's driver's license or permit. Where it exists, a school truancy officer is often a constable or sheriff, concurrently. The position of a full-time truancy officer is generally viewed as being a relic from the 19th century when mandatory school attendance was relatively new.|$|R

Other U.S. utility companies asked for the same automated callout system, and McLeod focused his business on developing automated callout systems. McLeod spun off this business line in 2006, creating ARCOS. Originally, the software assumed that all utility crews were available, but that wasn't always true. So ARCOS had its scheduling software sync with work management programs. As a human capital management system, it also now keeps track as a status changes.|$|R

SatNavs, help systems, automatic telephone answering systems, and even robotic vacuum cleaners are positioned {{to do more than}} exist on the side-lines as potential tools. These devices, intentionally or not, often act in a way that intrudes into our social life. Virtual assistants pop up offering help when an error is encountered, the robot vacuum cleaner starts to clean while one is having tea with the vicar, and <b>automated</b> <b>call</b> handling <b>systems</b> refuse to let you do what you want until you have answered a list of questions. This paper addresses {{the problem of how to}} produce artificial agents that are less socially inept. A distinction is drawn between things which are operationally available to us as human conversationalists and the things that are available to a third party (e. g. a scientists or engineer) in terms of an explicit explanation or representation. The former implies a detailed skill at recognising and negotiating the subtle and context-dependent rules of human social interaction, but this skill is largely unconscious – we do not know how we do it, in the sense of the later kind of understanding.

A modified version of semantic tableaux method is used to implement the propositional prover. Also, this theorem proving method is adapted for computing extensions because one of its purpose is to produce models, and extensions are models of the world described by default theories. 1...|$|R
