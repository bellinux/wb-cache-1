50|$|The 8085 is {{supplied}} in a 40-pin DIP package. To maximise the functions on the available pins, the 8085 uses a multiplexed address/data bus.

These include the 8755, with an <b>address</b> <b>latch,</b> 2 KB of EPROM and 16 I/O pins, and the 8155 with 256 bytes of RAM, 22 I/O pins and a 14-bit programmable timer/counter.

50|$|Because the I/O {{address is}} output {{separate}}ly, the I/O ports must hold (latch) the selection.

Two I/O ports (or RAM addresses) can be active at the same time, using the bank select signals to rapidly switch between them without further addressing.|$|R

5000|$|As {{a member}} of the Intel MCS-85 device family, the 8237 is an 8-bit device with 16-bit addressing. However, it is {{compatible}} with the 8086/88 microprocessors. The IBM PC and PC XT models (machine types 5150 and 5160) have an 8088 CPU and an 8-bit system bus architecture; the latter interfaces directly to the 8237, but the 8088 has a 20-bit address bus, so four additional 4-bit address latches, one for each DMA channel, are added alongside the 8237 to augment the address counters. However, because these external latches are separate from the 8237 address counters, they are never automatically incremented or decremented during DMA operations, making it impossible to perform a DMA operation across a 64 KiB address boundary. Attempts to cross a 64 KiB boundary in a DMA transfer will wrap around within one 64 KiB block of memory. (For example, if a DMA channel and the associated <b>address</b> <b>latch</b> were programmed to transfer 256 bytes to ascending addresses starting at address 0x3FF8C, instead of transferring to addresses 0x3FF8C through 0x4008B, data would be transferred to addresses 0x3FF8C through 0x3FFFF and then to 0x30000 through 0x3008B.) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a simple scheme for mapping synchronous language models, {{in the form}} of Boolean Mealy Machines, into timed automata. The mapping captures certain idealized implementation details that are ignored, or assumed away, by the synchronous paradigm. In this regard, the scheme may be compared with other approaches such as the AASAP semantics. However, our model <b>addresses</b> input <b>latching</b> and reaction triggering differently. Additionally, the focus is not on model-checking but rather on creating a semantic model for simulating synchronous controllers within Simulink. The model considers both sample-driven and event-driven execution paradigms, and clarifies their similarities and differences. It provides a means of analyzing the timing behavior of small-scale embedded controllers. The integration of the timed automata models into Simulink is described and related work is discussed.

40|$|International audienceThis paper <b>addresses</b> the <b>latching</b> {{control of}} wave energy converters. The {{principle}} of this control {{approach is to}} bring the wave energy generator into resonance with the incident wave using a clamping mechanism. Maximum energy extraction is the control objective. The main challenge in any latching control scheme is to calculate the precise time when to release the device {{after it has been}} locked at zero velocity. At the example of a generic heaving buoy device and using real wave data, three latching strategies are compared to a PI velocity control. The simplest considered latching strategy releases the device as soon as the wave force reaches a certain threshold. The other strategies use a short-term wave prediction in order to calculate the latching timing. Imperfect wave predictions based on AR models and imperfect mechanical to electrical and electrical to mechanical power conversions are taken into account. While the imperfect wave predictions impact the achievable performance with the predictive latching strategies, the imperfect power conversions have a high impact on the PI velocity control due to its reactive power flow...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the construction of}} complex three-dimensional (3 -D) nanostructures using only 2 -D, planar nano-fabrication techniques. In {{the state of the}} art, multiple 2 -D layers are fabricated in series, each directly on top of the previous. The method advocated here is Nanostructured Origami, in which multiple adjacent 2 -D layers are fabricated in parallel and are then folded into the desired 3 -D configuration using the appropriate folding sequence. This thesis focuses on folding actuation for this method using the residual tensile stress in vacuum-evaporated chromium to fold silicon nitride membranes. Our results conclusively demonstrate the ability to pattern these membranes with nano-scale features and then controllably fold them into a predetermined 3 -D configuration. Future work will refine the fabrication procedure for large-scale manufacturing and <b>address</b> alignment and <b>latching</b> of the folded membranes. by William Jay Arora. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|The 74 AHC 259; 74 AHCT 259 is a {{high-speed}} Si-gate CMOS device and is pin compatible with Low-power Schottky TTL (LSTTL). It is specified {{in compliance with}} JEDEC standard No. 7 -A. The 74 AHC 259; 74 AHCT 259 is {{a high-speed}} 8 -bit addressable latch designed for general purpose storage applications in digital systems. It is a multifunctional device capable of storing single-line data in eight addressable latches and providing a 3 -to- 8 decoder and multiplexer function with active HIGH outputs (Q 0 to Q 7). It also incorporates an active LOW common reset (MR) for resetting all latches {{as well as an}} active LOW enable input (LE). The 74 AHC 259; 74 AHCT 259 has four modes of operation: • In the addressable latch mode, data on the data line (D) is written into the addressed latch. The addressed latch will follow the data input with all non-addressed latches remaining in their previous states. • In the memory mode, all latches remain in their previous states and are unaffected by the data or address inputs. • In the 3 -to- 8 decoding or demultiplexing mode, the addressed output follows the state of the data input (D) with all other outputs in the LOW state. • In the reset mode, all outputs are LOW and unaffected by the address inputs (A 0 to A 2) and data input (D). When operating the 74 AHC 259; 74 AHCT 259 as an <b>address</b> <b>latch,</b> changing more than one bit of the address could impose a transient-wrong address. Therefore, this should only be done while in the memory mode. ■ Balanced propagation delays ■ All inputs have Schmitt-trigger actions ■ Combines demultiplexer and 8 -bit latch ■ Serial-to-parallel capability ■ Output from each storage bit available ■ Random (addressable) data entry ■ Easily expandable ■ Common reset input ■ Useful as a 3 -to- 8 active HIGH decoder ■ Inputs accept voltages higher than VCCNXP Semiconductor...|$|E

The 74 HC 237 is a 3 -to- 8 line decoder, demultiplexer with latches at the three address inputs (An). The 74 HC 237 essentially combines the 3 -to- 8 decoder function with a 3 -bit storage latch. When the latch is enabled (LE = LOW), the 74 HC 237 acts as a 3 -to- 8 active LOW decoder. When the latch enable (LE) goes from LOW-to-HIGH, the last data present at the inputs before this transition, is stored in the <b>latches.</b> Further <b>address</b> changes are ignored as long as LE remains HIGH. The output enable input (E 1 and E 2) controls {{the state of the}} outputs independent of the <b>address</b> inputs or <b>latch</b> operation. All outputs are HIGH unless E 1 is LOW and E 2 is HIGH. The 74 HC 237 is ideally suited for implementing non-overlapping decoders in 3 -state systems and strobed (stored address) applications in bus-oriented systems. 2.
