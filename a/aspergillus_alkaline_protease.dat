Actinomycetes are gram positive bacteria that produce different enzymes such as proteases. The aims of this research were isolation of native alkaline protease-producing Actinomycete spp. from different soil samples as well as optimizing the conditions for enzyme production. Materials and Methods: The different soil samples were collected from different locations of the provinces of Khouzestan, Chahar Mahalo Bakhtiari and Isfahan, Iran. After determining of the best <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> producing species using Lowry method, the optimization of <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> was performed.

40|$|The innate {{immune system}} recognizes and rapidly kills invading {{bacteria}} via different mechanisms. Bacteria exploit several strategies to evade recognition by the immune system {{in order to survive}} within the host. An important strategy of bacteria is the secretion of proteins that block crucial functions of the immune system either by binding or degradation of host proteins. The gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) causes chronic infections in patients with cystic fibrosis and immunocompromised patients. In this thesis new bacterial proteins and strategies of P. aeruginosa are described that interfere with recognition and activation of the {{innate immune system}}. <b>Alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> of P. aeruginosa degrades the ligand for Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR 5) and blocks two out of three activation pathways of the complement system. TLR 5 recognizes flagellin, the building block of the bacterial flagellum. This propeller-like structure is essential for bacterial motility and consists of flagellin polymers. <b>Alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> degrades TLR 5 -activating monomeric flagellin, in contrast to the polymeric form of flagellin, which is necessary for bacterial motility. In addition to mammals, plants have a similar flagellin sensing system via the receptor FLS 2, which activation is inhibited via the same mechanism by <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease.</b> In this way, <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> blocks flagellin sensing in both mammals and plants, while bacterial motility is maintained. Analysis of the complement inhibiting activity of <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> resulted in the identification of complement C 2 as another target of this protease. C 2 plays an essential role in activation of the classical (recognition of antigen-antibody complexes) and lectin (recognition of bacterial sugar structures) pathway. Degradation of C 2 by <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> blocks both pathways and all downstream effects, such as recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of infection, phagocytosis, and killing of bacteria.

Enzyme production by the B. subtilis strain VV was to the tune of 4030 [*]±[*] 128 U/g solid substrate (cow dung) after 72 h of incubation at 37 °C. The selection of a cheap substrate in SSF for the production of any metabolites is an important factor from an industrial point of view. Apart from the cost, the availability of the substrate is a critical factor. An ideal substrate is one which is available in large quantities and throughout the year too. Although many cheap agro-industrial residues were evaluated (Prakasham et al. 2006; Johnvesly et al. 2002;Gessesse 1997) for the production of <b>alkaline</b> <b>proteases,</b> the availability of these substrates is seasonal. Apart from agro-industrial wastes, more attention has been paid to the evaluation of solid wastes for the production of <b>alkaline</b> <b>proteases</b> (Ravindran et al. 2011; Ganesh Kumar et al. 2008). Waste water from the manufacture of shochu was also tried (Morimura et al. 1994) for production of proteases. In spite of evaluating these substrates, the search for a novel substrate continues. Recently, we used cow dung as a substrate for the production of a halo-tolerant <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> using a alkalophilic isolate, Halomonas sp. PV 1 (Vijayaraghavan and Vincent 2012).

The protein content of the cow dung medium was evaluated before and after fermentation. The cow dung possessed 80 [*]±[*] 12 mg protein/g solid substrate, and the organism utilized 40 [*]±[*] 4.5 % of the protein content for the growth and synthesis of protease.|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Alkaline</b> <b>proteases</b> {{are among}} the most {{important}} classes of industrial hydrolytic enzymes. The industrial demand for <b>alkaline</b> <b>proteases</b> with favorable properties continues to enhance the search for new enzymes. The present study focused on isolation of new alkaline producing alkaliphilic bacteria from hyper saline soda lakes and optimization of the enzyme production. Results: A new potent <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> producing halotolerant alkaliphilic isolate NPST-AK 15 was isolated from hyper saline soda lakes, which affiliated to Bacillus sp. based on 16 S rRNA gene analysis. Organic nitrogen supported enzyme production showing maximum yield using yeast extract, and as a carbon source, fructose gave maximum protease production. NPST-AK 15 can grow over a broad range of NaCl concentrations (0 – 20 %), showing maximal growth and enzyme production at 0 – 5 %, indicated the halotolerant nature of this bacterium. Ba and Ca enhanced enzyme production by 1. 6 and 1. 3 fold respectively. The optimum temperature and pH for both enzyme production and cell growth were at 40 °C and pH  11, respectively. <b>Alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> secretion was coherent with the growth pattern, started at beginning of the exponential phase and reached maximal in mid stationary phase (36  h). Conclusions: A new halotolerant alkaliphilic <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> producing Bacillus sp. NPST-AK 15 was isolated from soda lakes. Optimization of various fermentation parameters resulted in an increase of enzyme yield by 22. 8 fold, indicating the significance of optimization of the fermentation parameters to obtain commercial yield of the enzyme. NPST-AK 15 and its extracellular <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> with salt tolerance signify their potential applicability in the laundry industry and other applications...|$|R
30|$|The protein {{sequence}} of the commercially available keratinase KerA from B. licheniformis PWD- 1 (Lin et al. 1995) was {{compared with that of}} B. polyfermenticus through a protein BLAST ([URL] KerA showed 65 % similarity to <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> precursor (GeneBank: ADP 23919.1), using the protein database of B. polyfermenticus. This suggested that the <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> precursor of B. polyfermenticus maybe attributed to keratinase and also existed in B. polyfermenticus B 4. Two primers, BP 01 and BP 02, were designed for B. polyfermenticus SCN 11 <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> precursor (GeneBank: HQ 436407.1). The single DNA fragment BP 0102 was amplified through PCR with primers BP 01 –BP 02 and B. polyfermenticus B 4 chromosome as a template. The PCR product BP 0102 was cloned into the plasmid pBluescript II SK(−) digested with EcoRV to generate pBlue-BP 0102, which was then subjected to DNA sequencing (Tri-I Biotech, Inc., New Taipei City) with T 7 and T 3 primers. The DNA fragment was translated to the corresponding polypeptide in silico and a BLASTX was performed to compare the translated sequence with <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> precursor protein. The result was showed in Additional file 1 : Figure S 1 revealed a 99 % similarity with <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> precursor (GeneBank: ADP 23919.1). Therefore, this gene fragment was putatively referred to as KerP.|$|R
30|$|Under {{the present}} {{experimental}} conditions, {{the results revealed}} {{that there was no}} relationship between a high <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> activity and high virulence isolates. B. bassiana had the most effective toxicity (95.83 %) but the high <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> activity was observed in V. alfalfae (95  U/ml). Many factors influence directly and indirectly protease activity and the virulence isolates in this process. More research is needed about this complex mechanism.|$|R
30|$|Ideally, <b>alkaline</b> <b>proteases</b> used in {{detergent}} formulation should demonstrate {{high level}} of activity and stability over {{a broad range of}} pH and temperature, possess broad substrate specificity and be active in the presence of detergent ingredients, such as surfactants, bleaching agents, fabric softeners, and other formulation aids [7]. Hence, it is imperative to search for new <b>alkaline</b> <b>proteases</b> with desirable properties for commercial viability from various bacterial sources.|$|R
40|$|A {{sequential}} optimization strategy, {{based on}} statistical experimental designs, is employed {{to enhance the}} production of <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> by a Bacillus pseudofirmus local isolate. To screen the bioprocess parameters significantly influencing the <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> activity, a 2 -level Plackett-Burman design was applied. Among 15 variables tested, the pH, peptone, and incubation time were selected based on their high positive {{significant effect on the}} protease activity. A near-optimum medium formulation was then obtained that increased the protease yield by more than 5 -fold. Thereafter, the response surface methodology (RSM) was adopted to acquire the best process conditions among the selected variables, where a 3 -level Box-Behnken design was utilized to create a polynomial quadratic model correlating the relationship between the three variables and the protease activity. The optimal combination of the major medium constituents for <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> production, evaluated using the nonlinear optimization algorithm of EXCEL-Solver, was as follows: pH of 9. 5, 2 % peptone, and incubation time of 60 h. The predicted optimum <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> activity was 3, 213 U/ml/min, which was 6. 4 times the activity with the basal medium...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to examine the effect of Pseudomonas aeruginosa <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> and elastase on human polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemiluminescence. Both a luminol-enhanced and a nonenhanced chemiluminescence system using opsonized zymosan were utilized. It was found that <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> and elastase at concentrations of 25 micrograms/ml strongly inhibited luminol-enhanced myeloperoxidase-mediated chemiluminescence, whereas inhibition of the nonenhanced chemiluminescence response was about 50 %. In an attempt to determine the mechanism of inhibition of neutrophil chemiluminescence by these proteases, we examined the effect of various inhibitors of neutrophil oxidative metabolism on chemiluminescence, namely, superoxide dismutase, sodium azide, and catalase. It was shown that the pattern of inhibition of chemiluminescence by <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> and elastase was similar to that of sodium azide, inhibitor of myeloperoxidase. The present study demonstrates that <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> and elastase, extracellular products of P. aeruginosa, are capable of inhibiting myeloperoxidase-mediated chemiluminescence, one of the major antimicrobial systems of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These findings provide further evidence for the role of P. aeruginosa exoproteases as virulence factors in the pathogenesis of infections caused by this microorganism...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigations}} was to improve the yield of <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> for leather dehairing by subjecting the indigenous proteolytic strain Bacillus licheniformis N- 2 to various mutagenic treatments viz. UV irradiations, NTG (N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguinidine) and MMS (methyl methane sulfonate). After screening on skim milk agar plates, a total of nine positive mutants were selected for shake flask experiments. Among these, the best proteolytic mutant designated as UV- 9 showed 1. 4 fold higher <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> activity in preoptimized growth medium than the parent strain. The fermentation profile and kinetic parameters such u(h- 1), Yp/s, Yp/x, Yx/s, q s, Qs, q p and Qp also indicated the superiority of the selected mutant UV- 9 for <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> production over the parent strain and rest of the mutants. The dehairing capability of mutant UV- 9 <b>alkaline</b> <b>protease</b> was analyzed by soaking goat skin pieces for different time intervals (3 - 15 h) at 40 º C. A complete dehairing without degradation of collagen was achieved after 12 h, indicating its commercial exploitation in leather industry...|$|R
