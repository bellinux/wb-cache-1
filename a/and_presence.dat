40|$|AbstractNumerous {{studies have}} {{explored}} the affordances of 3 D virtual worlds. Although previous studies indicated that virtual worlds {{would be helpful}} for experiential and collaborative learning through enhancing physical <b>and</b> social <b>presence,</b> few studies have investigated what determines physical <b>and</b> social <b>presence</b> <b>and</b> what are their roles in learning and teaching in virtual worlds. The current study investigates the influences of individual differences such as age, gender, and epistemological beliefs on physical <b>and</b> social <b>presence.</b> This study also investigates the influences of physical <b>and</b> social <b>presence</b> on situational interest and perceived achievement in virtual role-play. The role-play activity allowed pre-service teachers (n= 151) to teach their peers in realistic classroom contexts within Second Life and {{to reflect on their}} language use as teachers. This study found that pre-service teachers' age and epistemological beliefs significantly influenced their physical <b>and</b> social <b>presence</b> in the virtual world. This finding implies that physical <b>and</b> social <b>presence</b> are influenced not only by the representational fidelity of virtual worlds but also by individual differences. In addition, physical <b>and</b> social <b>presence</b> positively influenced situational interest and perceived achievement. More attention should be paid to the roles of physical <b>and</b> social <b>presence</b> in teaching <b>and</b> learning in virtual worlds...|$|R

5|$|Crime {{continued}} to be a problem at the Anacostia Station late into {{the first decade of the}} 21st century. Assaults and shootings were more frequent at the station than at any other station in the transit system. There were 32 robberies at the station in 2007. Although Anacostia was one of the 10 Metro stations with the highest crime rate in 2007 (and the only such station on the list inside the District of Columbia), no auto thefts or auto break-ins were reported at the station that year. To help deter crime, Metro installed outdoor security cameras at all 10 high-crime Metrorail stations in July 2008. In September 2008, Metro Transit Police stepped up their visibility <b>and</b> <b>presence</b> at all stations with high student ridership, including Anacostia.|$|E

He has stated that he prefers formations that use four lines of players (as opposed to three lines in the classic 4–4–2) due to the added depth in defence <b>and</b> <b>presence</b> in midfield, and was inspired to use the formations by Carlo Ancelotti. He has also stated that he prefers the 4–3–3 formation to the 4–4–2 formation, and has criticised the way he perceives 4–4–2 to be 'ingrained in the culture' of English football.

5|$|In {{patients}} developing liver failure, a {{liver transplant}} is often the only option to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain the transplant. That being the case, the criteria have been reassessed, such as onset of symptoms, prothrombin time (PTT), serum bilirubin, <b>and</b> <b>presence</b> of encephalopathy, for determining at what point a transplant becomes necessary for survival. Evidence suggests, although survival rates have improved with modern medical treatment, in patients with moderate to severe poisoning, {{up to half of}} those who did recover suffered permanent liver damage. A follow-up study has shown most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36 hours of mushroom ingestion.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{exploratory}} study was (1) to investigate how student perceptions of cognitive <b>presence,</b> social <b>presence,</b> <b>and</b> teaching <b>presence</b> in an online Community of Inquiry are related to motivation, (2) how student perceptions of cognitive presence, social <b>presence,</b> teaching <b>presence,</b> <b>and</b> motivation are related to learning flow, and (3) to explore how individual learners perceive their learning flow experience in courses in an online master’s degree program. A sequential explanatory (QUAN→qual) mixed method design was employed. A total of 77 students participated in this study. Multiple linear regression analysis and path analysis were adopted to identify the relationships among the factors of interest for the quantitative data analyses. Student interviews were administered to provide the qualitative data to support interpretation of the quantitative results. ^ Motivation had a strong positive relationship {{with each of the}} three presences (cognitive <b>presence,</b> social <b>presence,</b> <b>and</b> teaching <b>presence)</b> of the Community of Inquiry framework. Teaching <b>presence,</b> social <b>presence,</b> <b>and</b> cognitive <b>presence</b> statistically significantly predicted students’ perceptions of motivation. Learning flow had a strong positive relationship with motivation and each of the three presences (cognitive <b>presence,</b> social <b>presence,</b> <b>and</b> teaching <b>presence)</b> of the Community of Inquiry framework. Cognitive <b>presence</b> <b>and</b> motivation statistically significantly predicted students’ perceptions of learning flow. Teaching <b>presence</b> <b>and</b> cognitive <b>presence</b> had a positive direct effect on motivation. Cognitive <b>presence</b> <b>and</b> motivation had a positive direct effect on learning flow, and there was a partial mediation effect of motivation between cognitive <b>presence</b> <b>and</b> learning flow. The identified key themes that emerged from the data about students’ perceptions of their learning flow experience were as follows: 1) students are deeply absorbed in learning when learning activities or materials are pragmatic and relevant to their real life situation, 2) instructors’ guidance encourages students and promotes their learning flow, 3) students are immersed in learning when they are able to construct and confirm meaning through assignments, 4) weekly online discussions evoke learning flow, 5) collaboration has an impact on students’ learning flow, and 6) distractive learning environments obstruct learning flow. ^ Based on the results, implications for instructional strategies to enhance student learning flow in students 2 ̆ 7 online learning activities were developed. Limitations of the study and suggestions for future research were discussed. ...|$|R
5|$|Since a {{major cause}} of TBI are vehicle accidents, their {{prevention}} or the amelioration of their consequences can both reduce the incidence and gravity of TBI. In accidents, damage can be reduced by use of seat belts, child safety seats and motorcycle helmets, <b>and</b> <b>presence</b> of roll bars and airbags. Education programs exist to lower the number of crashes. In addition, changes to public policy and safety laws can be made; these include speed limits, seat belt and helmet laws, and road engineering practices.|$|E
5|$|The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature {{states that}} names of fungi adopted by Fries in Systema Mycologicum vols. 1–3 are sanctioned, that is, they are conserved against earlier {{homonyms}} and competing synonyms. This {{means that the}} name Hypochnus rubrocinctum has priority over Byssus sanguinea. The type material of H.rubrocinctum was examined by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in Berlin; it has since been destroyed, probably during the Second World War. The drawing in Erhenberg's 1820 publication serves as the lectotype. The species {{was transferred to the}} genus Cryptothecia by Swedish lichenologist Göran Thor in 1991, {{on the basis of its}} similarity with C.striata such as the thallus with radiate ridges, granular isidia, <b>and</b> <b>presence</b> of para-depsides (gyrophoric acid in C.striata and confluentic acid in C.rubrocincta).|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} {{has been}} noted to often co-occur with Amanita muscaria or A.rubescens, although {{it is unclear whether}} this is due to a biological association between the species, or because of similarities in growing season, habitat, and ecological requirements. An association has also been reported between B.edulis and Amanita excelsa on Pinus radiata ectomycorrhizae in New Zealand, suggesting that other fungi may influence the life cycle of porcini. A 2007 field study revealed little correlation between the abundance of fruit bodies <b>and</b> <b>presence</b> of its mycelia below ground, even when soil samples were taken from directly beneath the mushroom; the study concluded that the triggers leading to formation of mycorrhizae and production of the fruit bodies were more complex.|$|E

5|$|Mushrooms {{are mostly}} found during hot spells {{in summer and}} autumn, growing in {{mycorrhizal}} association with various broad-leaved trees and sclerophyllous shrubs, especially oak (Quercus), beech (Fagus), chestnut (Castanea), strawberry trees (Arbutus), treeheath (Erica), and rockrose (Cistus), showing a preference for acid soils. Roadsides and parks are common habitats. The cork oak in particular is an important symbiont, {{and the distribution of}} B.aereus (along with B.mamorensis) aligns with the tree across Europe and North Africa. The ectomycorrhizae that B.aereus forms with sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) and downy oak (Quercus pubescens) have been described in detail. They are characterized by a lack of hyphal clamps, a plectenchymatous mantle (made of parallel-orientated hyphae with little branching or overlap), and rhizomorphs with differentiated hyphae. A 2007 field study on four species of boletes revealed little correlation between the abundance of fruit bodies <b>and</b> <b>presence</b> of its mycelia below ground, even when soil samples were taken from directly beneath the mushroom; the study concluded that the triggers leading to formation of mycorrhizae and production of the fruit bodies appear to be more complex than previously thought.|$|E

The Community of Inquiry theory was the framework used in this descriptive correlational study of RN-BSN students (n= 76). Variables were measured using the Community of Inquiry Survey and the Perceived Student Satisfaction Scale instruments, and a researcher developed survey. Findings indicated students' perceived teaching <b>and</b> cognitive <b>presence</b> were present to a greater extent than social presence.

5|$|Reports {{of damage}} to the {{hypoglossal}} nerve are rare. The most common causes of injury in one case series were compression by tumours and gunshot wounds. A wide variety of other causes can lead to damage of the nerve. These include surgical damage, medullary stroke, multiple slcerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, infection, sarcoidosis, <b>and</b> <b>presence</b> of an ectatic vessel in the hypoglossal canal. Damage can be on one or both sides, which will affect symptoms that the damage causes. Because of the close proximity of the nerve to other structures including nerves, arteries, and veins, it is rare for the nerve to be damaged in isolation. For example, damage {{to the left and}} right hypoglossal nerves may occur with damage to the facial and trigeminal nerves as a result of damage from a clot following arteriosclerosis of the vertebrobasilar artery. Such a stroke may result in tight oral musculature, and difficulty speaking, eating and chewing.|$|E
5|$|SAH {{is often}} {{associated}} with a poor outcome. The death rate (mortality) for SAH is between 40 and 50 percent, but trends for survival are improving. Of those that survive hospitalization, more than a quarter have significant restrictions in their lifestyle, and less than a fifth have no residual symptoms whatsoever. Delay in diagnosis of minor SAH (mistaking the sudden headache for migraine) contributes to poor outcome. Factors found on admission that are associated with poorer outcome include poorer neurological grade; systolic hypertension; a previous diagnosis of heart attack or SAH; liver disease; more blood and larger aneurysm on the initial CT scan; location of an aneurysm in the posterior circulation; and higher age. Factors that carry a worse prognosis during the hospital stay include occurrence of delayed ischemia resulting from vasospasm, development of intracerebral hematoma, or intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding into the ventricles of the brain) <b>and</b> <b>presence</b> of fever on the eighthday of admission.|$|E
