5|$|Meanwhile, {{a backup}} relief party of 77 teams and wagons was {{making its way}} east to provide {{additional}} assistance to the Martin Company. After passing Fort Bridger {{the leaders of the}} backup party concluded that the Martin Company must have wintered east of the Rockies, so they turned back. When word of the returning backup relief party was communicated to Young, he ordered the courier to return <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> turn back east and continue until they found the handcart company, but several days had been lost. On November 18 the backup party met the Martin Company with the greatly needed supplies. At last {{all the members of the}} handcart party were now able to ride in wagons. The 104 wagons carrying the Martin Company arrived in Salt Lake City on November 30; at least 145 members of the company had lost their lives. Many of the survivors had to have fingers, toes, or limbs amputated due to severe frostbite.|$|E
500|$|In 1904, {{numerous}} {{newspaper articles}} and editorials were written, mostly in Chicago, about the society. Those articles were often sensationalist {{and tended to}} put the society in a bad light. The views of the society, particularly those against marriage and promoting free love, were not accepted well in the small Ohio village of Lisbon. In fact, a local newspaper reprinted a warning that had been distributed in the community: [...] "Wanted – Fifty good women, over twenty and under fifty years of age; also fifty good honest-hearted men with families, to meet upon the Square when called upon, {{and go to the}} Spirit Fruit farm <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> take their departure at once or take the consequences, as tar is cheap and feathers plentiful." ...|$|E
500|$|Late on {{the night}} of August 15, Stark was awakened by the arrival of Parson Thomas Allen and a band of Massachusetts militiamen from nearby Berkshire County who insisted on joining his force. In {{response}} to the minister's fiery threat that his men would never come out again if they were not allowed to participate, Stark is reported to have said, [...] "Would you go now on this dark and rainy night? Go back to your people <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> get some rest if they can, and if the Lord gives us sunshine to-morrow and I do not give you fighting enough, I will never call on you to come again." [...] Stark's forces again swelled the next day with the arrival of some Stockbridge Indians, bringing his force (excluding Warner's men) to nearly 2,000 men.|$|E

500|$|After the concert, Tammy {{and several}} other girls are invited backstage, where they think the Jonas Brothers {{want to have sex}} with them. Instead, they {{convince}} the girls to wear purity rings as a pledge to abstinence, <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> get all of their friends to start wearing them as well because [...] "That is just the way we roll" [...] (a reference to one of their songs). To appease his girlfriend, Kenny reluctantly begins wearing a purity ring. As Kenny becomes dull as a result and ceases to spend time with his friends, it is revealed that the Jonas Brothers are being forced to wear and promote purity rings by their boss, Mickey Mouse. He is fearsome, greedy, sadistic, and foul-mouthed, and verbally berates and violently beats them when they complain that the rings are overshadowing their music and projecting the wrong message. Mickey explains that the rings allow him to sell sexual stimulation to young girls while giving the false appearance of innocence and purity. Concerned for their friend, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman attempt to confront the Jonas Brothers at a televised appearance in Denver; but Mickey, mistaking the boys for secret agents hired by DreamWorks (or Michael Eisner) to sabotage the televised appearance, tranquilizes them and takes them prisoner backstage.|$|E
2500|$|Jones, a Sydney-based broadcaster, has criticised Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore's {{efforts to}} close lane ways and parking {{areas in the}} city of Sydney to cars. Jones says that this unduly inconveniences long-distance commuters and {{adversely}} affects city based businesses. On 29 June 2011, Jones said of the Lord Mayor of Sydney ... "put her in the same chaff bag as Julia Gillard and throw them both out to sea" [...] and about Greens leader Bob Brown ... "The woman's [...] off her tree and quite frankly they should shove her and Bob Brown in a chaff bag and take them as far out to sea as they can <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> swim home." [...] In February 2011, Jones asked Gillard on-air how she felt about being called [...] "Ju-liar" [...] and that [...] "......are saying that we've got a liar running the country" [...] following the reversal of her pre-election pledge not to introduce a new carbon tax. He also criticised her for being 10 minutes late for his program. These comments attracted condemnation from critics, including ABC Television's Jonathan Holmes of Media Watch.|$|E
2500|$|The Fortune Hunters track Maria's {{movements}} southward to a [...] "Lost City" [...] in South America, {{which they}} identify as Von Essen's principal base of operations. [...] Nathan infiltrates {{the base and}} there witnesses Maria and Von Essen have a falling out, following which Von Essen kills her. [...] A firefight then ensues between Nathan and Von Essen, during which Von Essen reveals his plan to use the Starker Sturm —his completed wind turbine weapon—to force Chicago and eventually all of North America under his fascist rule. [...] Von Essen activates hidden explosives causing the hide out to collapse. Nathan escapes but the Pandora is damaged by debris in the explosion and Von Essen escapes. After repairing the Pandora, Nathan and the Fortune Hunters return to Chicago and find it already besieged by Die Spinne. [...] The Fortune Hunters and the Red Skulls once again join forces to stop the invasion. Von Essen then appears in the Starker Sturm, and begins to attack Chicago's vital commercial and governmental structures. [...] Nathan destroys the war machines' power turbines causing it to explode, killing Von Essen in the ensuing explosion. Khan invites Nathan and the Fortune Hunters to a party to celebrate, saying he'll call ahead <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> put the drinks on ice.
