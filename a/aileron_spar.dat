50|$|The primary wing {{structure}} is a wood box spar connected to an <b>aileron</b> <b>spar</b> by ribs cut on a band saw. To {{the front of}} the main spar are strapped D-shaped fiberglass fuel tanks which can carry up to 12 imperial gallons per wing. Over the tanks is the framing and plywood skin of the wing's nose. Behind the main spar, the wings are covered in cloth. The wing section is the NACA 23012 with a 55 in chord; the wing is rectangular, being straight and untapered. No flaps were fitted to the prototype, but they were being considered.|$|E
50|$|The D.IX was {{a single}} bay biplane, its wings {{constructed}} in Fokker's established fashion with two box spars and fabric covering. The interplane struts were N-form while the cabane structure included two fully triangulated forward struts connecting to the forward spar, {{and a pair of}} single struts connecting to the rear <b>spar.</b> <b>Ailerons</b> were only fitted on the upper planes.|$|R
50|$|Derived {{from earlier}} Fleet Model 2, the Model 7 {{featured}} an aircraft structure {{consisting of a}} fabric-covered, welded-steel fuselage with metal panels forward of the wooden cockpits. It had steel-tube faring formers and wooden stringers. The wings were single bay of equal spans and wire braced. The upper wing was made in one piece and constructed with two solid Spruce <b>spars.</b> <b>Ailerons</b> were found only on the bottom wings. Stamped aluminium alloy ribs were used to construct the wings and steel-tube compression struts were at the interplane and centre section of the wings. Interlaced between the wings were streamlined landing and flying wires. Except for a broader chord tail-fin introduced after the first production series, while retaining the original rudder of the Model 2, the Model 7 was superficially identical to its earlier predecessor.|$|R
40|$|The {{provisions}} {{of this project}} call {{for the design of}} the structure of the wing and carry-through structure for the Viper primary trainer, which is to be certified as a utility category trainer under FAR part 23. The specific items to be designed in this statement of work were Front <b>Spar,</b> Rear <b>Spar,</b> <b>Aileron</b> Structure, Wing Skin, and Fuselage Carry-through Structure. In the design of these parts, provisions for the fuel system, electrical system, and control routing were required. Also, the total weight of the entire wing planform could not exceed 216 lbs. Since this aircraft is to be used as a primary trainer, and the SOW requires a useful life of 107 cycles, it was decided that all of the principle stresses in the structural members would be kept below 10 ksi. The only drawback to this approach is a weight penalty...|$|R
5000|$|The Akro was {{designed}} as a homebuilt aircraft for pilots who competed in aerobatic competitions. It was the first U.S. aircraft design to be guided by the Aresti Catalog of manoeuvres for such events. The structure absorbs high stresses, +12/-11g. The Akro is a cantilever mid wing monoplane with a wooden, two spar mahogany skinned wing built in one piece, its forward spar passing unbroken through the fuselage and the rear spar in two parts. The plain, statically balanced <b>ailerons</b> have steel <b>spars</b> with spruce ribs and trailing edges they are fabric covered and carry ground adjustable trim tabs. The tail unit is a fabric covered steel tube structure, wire braced and with swept, straight tapered surfaces. Like the ailerons, all the rear control surfaces are statically balanced. The rudder has a ground adjustable trim tab. The tailplane is mounted {{at the top of the}} fuselage, with variable incidence and a flight controllable trim tab in the elevator.|$|R
