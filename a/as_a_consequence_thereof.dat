Upon the arrival of his father, Marlow learns his mistake as regards the inn question, but flatly refuses to marry Hardcastle's daughter, claiming that she is too grand for him, and citing his preference for the maid servant.

40|$|Abstract — The {{parameterisation}} of rotations {{in three}} dimen-sional Euclidean space {{is an area}} of applied mathematics that has long been studied, dating back to the original works of Euler in the 18 th century. As such, many ways of parameterising a rotation have been developed over the years. Motivated by the task of representing the orientation of a balancing body, the fused angles parameterisation is developed and introduced in this paper. This novel representation is carefully defined both mathematically and geometrically, and thoroughly investigated in terms of the properties it possesses, and how it relates to other existing representations. A second intermediate representation, tilt angles, is also introduced <b>as</b> <b>a</b> natural <b>consequence</b> <b>thereof.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|Dispersed gas-liquid-solid flows are {{frequently}} encountered {{in a variety}} of industrial processes involving a. o. coating, granulation, drying and synthesis of fuels (Fischer Tropsch) and base chemicals.

In literature both the Eulerian and Lagrangian method have been adopted to study multiphase flows. Although these computational methods are in principle well-suited to simulate the large-scale flow behaviour problems arise related to the representation of the interactions between the individual phases (closure problem). In this paper a novel simulation approach will be presented for dispersed gas-liquid-solid three phase flows accounting for i) all important mutual interactions between the phases ii) all relevant forces acting on the phases iii) the three-dimensional nature of the flow. In view of its fundamental nature, it is an important complementary tool in developing closure equations for the Eulerian approach...|$|R

The scale-up of these processes is often problematic and is related to the intrinsic complexities of these flows which are unfortunately not yet fully understood despite significant efforts made in both academic and industrial research laboratories. In dense gas-particle flows both (effective) fluid-particle and (dissipative) particle-particle interactions need to be accounted for because these phenomena to a large extent govern the prevailing flow phenomena, i. e. the formation and evolution of heterogeneous structures. These structures have significant impact {{on the quality of the}} gas-solid contact and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> direct <b>consequence</b> <b>thereof</b> strongly affect the performance of the process. Due to the inherent complexity of dense gas-particles flows, we have adopted a multi-scale modeling approach in which both fluid-particle and particle-particle interactions can be properly accounted for. The idea is essentially that fundamental models, taking into account the relevant details of fluid-particle (lattice Boltzmann model) and particle-particle (discrete particle model) interactions, are used to develop closure laws to feed continuum models which can be used to compute the flow structures on a much larger (industrial) scale. Our multi-scale approach (see Fig. 1) involves the lattice Boltzmann model, the discrete particle model, the continuum model based on the kinetic theory of granular flow, and the discrete bubble model. In this paper we give an overview of the multi-scale modeling strategy, accompanied by illustrative computational results for bubble formation. In addition, areas which need substantial further attention will be highlighted...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} maintaining and reasoning with different versions of a knowledge base. We {{are interested in the}} scenario where a knowledge base (expressed in some logical formalism) might evolve over time and, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>consequence,</b> different versions <b>thereof</b> have to be maintained simultaneously in a parsimonious way. Moreover, users of the knowledge base should be able to access, not only any specific version, but also the differences between two given versions of the knowledge base. We address this problem by proposing a general semantic framework for the maintenance of different versions of a knowledge base. It turns out that the notion of semantic difference between knowledge bases plays {{a central role in the}} framework. We show that an appropriate characterization produces a unique definition of semantic difference which is applicable to a large class of logic-based knowledge representation languages. We then proceed to restrict our attention to finitely generated propositional logics, and show that our semantic framework can be represented syntactically in a particular kind of normal form, referred to as ordered complete conjunctive normal form or oc-CNF. This is followed by a generalization in which we show that similar results can be obtained for any syntactic representation (in a finitely generated propositional logic) of the semantic framework. Of particular interest are representations of appropriately chosen normal forms. We expect that our constructions for the propositional case can be extended to more expressive languages, such as description logics (DLs). In that respect, our results add to the investigation of the versioning problem for DL-based ontologies...|$|R

The basic idea is hereby that if data has already been extracted in the past, it could be used to reconstruct XPath queries that retrieve the data from a different DOM tree.
