Correlation between Tonsillitis and <b>Acute</b> Suppurative <b>Otitis</b> <b>Media</b> in General Hospital of Jombang Over the Period of January 1 st to December 31 st 2011. Undergraduated Thesis. Faculty of Medicine, Muhammadiyah University of Malang. Advisers : (1) Nanang Mardiraharjo* (2) Ruby Riana Asparini ** Background: The {{cause of}} <b>acute</b> suppurative <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> (ASOM) is {{upper respiratory tract}} infection (URI), in which tonsillitis is one most frequently found URI. The more frequently a child has respiratory tract infection, the greater possibility for that child to have ASOM. Objective: To discover the correlation between tonsillitis and <b>acute</b> suppurative <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> (ASOM). Method: Analytic observational with cross sectional approach with total sampling data collection. The sample was 113 medical record files, consisted of 71 acute tonsillitis patients and 42 chronic tonsillitis patients. The collected data was then analyzed using contingency correlation test with α= 0. 05. Result: From 113 samples, 12 <b>acute</b> suppurative <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> (ASOM) patients from acute tonsillitis were found {{and there was only}} 1 patient from chronic tonsillitis. Statistical test and analyses came out with the result that there was a significant between acute tonsillitis and <b>acute</b> suppurative <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with a weak correlation (ASOM) (p value= 0. 019) (r= 0. 215).

25|$|Otitis {{media is}} a group of {{inflammatory}} diseases of the middle ear. The two main types are <b>acute</b> <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME). AOM is an infection of abrupt onset that usually presents with ear pain. In young children this may result in pulling at the ear, increased crying, and poor sleep. Decreased eating and a fever may also be present. OME is typically not associated with symptoms. Occasionally a feeling of fullness is described. It is defined as the presence of non-infectious fluid in the middle ear for more than three months. Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is middle ear inflammation of greater than two weeks that results in episodes of discharge from the ear. It may be a complication of <b>acute</b> <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> Pain is rarely present. All three may be associated with hearing loss.

30|$|Even though ear {{infection}} {{is primarily a}} disease of infants and young children, it can also affect adults (Farhan et al. 2011). The disease may begin in childhood or as a complication of untreated or inadequately treated <b>acute</b> suppurative <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> or may be chronic from onset (Afolabi et al. 2012). The microorganisms may gain entry to the middle ear through a chronic perforation. Children tend to have higher predisposition to {{ear infection}} than adults because anatomy of the eustachian tube in children permits easier access of organism through the nasopharynx. Moreover, the incidence is higher in males than females (Afolabi et al. 2012; Seid et al. 2013).|$|R
25|$|It is {{important}} to weigh the benefits and harms before using antibiotics for <b>acute</b> <b>otitis</b> <b>media.</b> As over 82% of acute episodes settle without treatment, about 20 children must be treated to prevent one case of ear pain, 33 children to prevent one perforation, and 11 children to prevent one opposite-side ear infection. For every 14 children treated with antibiotics, one child has an episode of either vomiting, diarrhea or a rash. If pain is present, treatment to reduce it should be initiated.|$|E
25|$|In severe or {{untreated}} cases, {{the tympanic}} membrane may perforate, allowing the pus in the middle-ear space to drain into the ear canal. If there is enough, this drainage may be obvious. Even though the perforation of {{the tympanic membrane}} suggests a highly painful and traumatic process, it is almost always associated with a dramatic relief of pressure and pain. In a simple case of <b>acute</b> <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> in an otherwise healthy person, the body's defenses are likely to resolve the infection and the ear drum nearly always heals.|$|E
25|$|Oral and topical pain killers are {{effective}} {{to treat the}} pain caused by otitis media. Oral agents include ibuprofen, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and opiates. Topical agents shown to be effective include antipyrine and benzocaine ear drops.

Half of cases of ear pain in children resolve without treatment in three days and 90% resolve in seven or eight days.

40|$|<b>Otitis</b> <b>media,</b> {{a common}} and often {{recurrent}} bacterial infection of childhood, {{is a major}} reason for physician visits and the prescription of antimicrobials. Haemophilus influenzae is the cause of ≈ 20 % of episodes of bacterial <b>otitis</b> <b>media,</b> but most strains lack the capsule, a factor known to {{play a critical role in}} the virulence of strains causing invasive H. influenzae disease. Here we show that in capsule-deficient (nontypeable) strains, sialic acid, a terminal residue of the core sugars of H. influenzae lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is a critical virulence factor in the pathogenesis of experimental <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> in chinchillas. We used five epidemiologically distinct H. influenzae isolates, representative of the genetic diversity of strains causing <b>otitis</b> <b>media,</b> to inoculate the middle ear of chinchillas. All animals developed <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> that persisted for up to 3 wk, whereas isogenic sialic acid-deficient mutants (disrupted sialyltransferase or CMP-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase genes) were profoundly attenuated. MS analysis indicated that WT bacteria used to inoculate animals lacked any sialylated LPS glycoforms. In contrast, LPS of ex vivo organisms recovered from chinchilla middle ear exudates was sialylated. We conclude that sialylated LPS glycoforms play a key role in pathogenicity of nontypeable H. influenzae and depend on scavenging the essential precursors from the host during the infection...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Otitis</b> <b>media</b> is {{a common}} {{inflammatory}} disorder caused by the effusion of fluids or pathological changes in the tympanic membrane of middle ear that leads to hearing loss in all age groups which may be either temporary or permanent. Objective: The present study aimed to identify the risk factors responsible for the onset and progression of <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> and its subtypes {{as well as its}} associated co-morbidities in the South Indian population. Subjects and methods: The study constituted 2602 subjects including children and adults affected with OM and the diagnosis was confirmed by ENT specialists using all the required otorhinolaryngological tests. The study was carried out by the institutional ethical clearance. The data were coded and evaluations were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, PASW STATISTICS 18. 0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results: squamous-chronic suppurative <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> was highly prevalent (47. 3 %) followed by mucosal-chronic suppurative <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> (18. 5 %), <b>acute</b> suppurative <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> (17. 6 %), and <b>otitis</b> <b>media</b> with effusion (16. 6 %).
