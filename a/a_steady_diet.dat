Giving Enter the Grave four out of five stars, Kerrang!s James Hoare commented that the album was [...] "honed on <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>diet</b> of early Slayer, Sacred Reich and Nuclear Assault", summarizing the full-length as [...] "an absolute hair-swirling, air-punching beast".

500|$|Carnivàle {{was often}} {{compared}} to David Lynch's 1990s mystery TV series Twin Peaks and John Steinbeck's 1939 novel The Grapes of Wrath. Matt Roush of TV Guide called Carnivàle [...] "the perfect show {{for those who}} thought Twin Peaks was too accessible", whereas the show reminded Salon.com's Heather Havrilesky of the [...] "disappointment you feel as a kid {{when you come to}} the last few pages of The Grapes of Wrath." [...] She argued that a [...] "surreal Twin Peaks-style shockfest [...] hardly bears repeating," [...] especially if it [...] "avoid the 'hugging and learning' of mainstream television [...] such <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> <b>diet</b> of anguish and dashed hopes that viewers refuse to take the risk of making an emotional connection." [...] Carnivàle, as The Australian stated, [...] "seems to have been conceived in essentially literary terms" [...] which [...] "can sometimes work on the page but is deadly on the large screen, let alone a small one. It's almost like a biblical injunction against pretension on television." [...] A reviewer admitted his temptation to dismiss the first season of Carnivàle as [...] "too artsy and esoteric" [...] because his lack of involvement prevented him from understanding [...] "what the heck was going on, [...] can be a problem for a dramatic television series." [...] TV Zone however considered Carnivàle [...] "a series like no other and [...] {{the fact that it is}} so open to interpretation surprisingly proves to be one of its greatest strengths." [...] Carnivàle was lauded for bringing [...] "the hopelessness of the Great Depression to life" [...] and for being among the first TV shows to show [...] "unmitigated pain and disappointment", but reviewers were not confident that viewers would find the [...] "slowly unfolding sadness" [...] appealing over long or would have the patience or endurance to find out the meaning of the show.|$|E

25|$|For Fugazi's second studio-album <b>Steady</b> <b>Diet</b> of Nothing, {{released}} in July 1991, the band once again asked Ted Niceley to produce. Niceley {{had become a}} chef and had to reluctantly turn down the job, so the band members decided to produce the record themselves. After the success of Repeater and its subsequent world tour, <b>Steady</b> <b>Diet</b> was highly anticipated, six months prior to its release Dischord had pre-orders in excess of 160,000 for the album.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Fort Yamhill, {{located in}} the eastern foothills of the Oregon Coast Range near modern day Grand Ronde, Oregon, was a U. S. Army post {{established}} in March 1856 {{as part of a}} three fort system to guard the newly established Coast Reservation and to provide a Union presence in the state during the American Civil War. This thesis examines U. S. Army foodways at Fort Yamhill and provides a basis for future work on the subject. Combining the archaeological and archival data from the site provided the unique opportunity to examine the foodways of the mid- 19 th century U. S. Army holistically. Results of this research suggests that although the soldiers stationed at Fort Yamhill were at the end of long supply lines and far from populated cities, the diet consumed by the soldiers was adequate and often abundant. Procuring subsistence stores from many sources soldiers were able to procure <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> and healthful <b>diet</b> and often had the opportunity to display social and economic status through their patterns of food consumption...|$|R

6000|$|Quite {{like other}} boys Lowell was {{subjected}} to the processes of the more formal education of books. He was first sent to a [...] "dame school," [...] {{and then to the}} private school of William Wells, under whose rigid tuition he became thoroughly grounded in the classics. Among his schoolfellows was W.W. Story, the poet-sculptor, who continued his life-long friend. Thomas Wentworth Higginson, {{who was one of the}} younger boys of the school, recalls the high talk of Story and Lowell about the Fairie Queen. At fifteen he entered Harvard College, then an institution with about two hundred students. The course of study in those days was narrow and dull, <b>a</b> pretty <b>steady</b> <b>diet</b> of Greek, Latin and Mathematics, with an occasional dessert of Paley's Evidences of Christianity or Butler's Analogy. Lowell was not distinguished for scholarship, but he read omnivorously and wrote copiously, often in smooth flowing verse, fashioned after the accepted English models of the period. He was an editor of Harvardiana, the college magazine, and was elected class poet in his senior year. But his habit of lounging with the poets in the secluded alcoves of the old library, in preference to attending recitations, finally became too scandalous for official forbearance, and he was rusticated, [...] "on account of constant neglect of his college duties," [...] as the faculty records state. He was sent to Concord, where his exile was not without mitigating profit, as he became acquainted with Emerson and Thoreau. Here he wrote the class poem, which he was permitted to circulate in print at his Commencement. This production, which now stands at the head of the list of his published works, was curiously unprophetic of his later tendencies. It was written in the neatly, polished couplets of the Pope type and other imitative metres, and aimed to satirize the radical movements of the period, especially the transcendentalists and abolitionists, with both of whom he was soon to be in active sympathy.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Steady</b> <b>Diet</b> of Nothing was {{recorded}} during January and February 1991 at Inner Ear Studios and is notable {{for being the}} group's first self-produced release. As a result of not having an outside producer besides engineer Don Zientara, the album's recording and mixing sessions were tough on the band. Guy Picciotto said of making the record, [...] "it was a tough record for us to make. It was our first attempt at producing and mixing by ourselves, and we didn’t feel like we {{had a really good}} handle, technically, on what we wanted to do. And we were also pretty fried from a shitload of back-to-back touring. I appreciate <b>Steady</b> <b>Diet</b> for <b>a</b> lot of things, but there was a flatness to both the performances and the sound that was weird to us." [...] Singer/guitarist Ian MacKaye explained, [...] "It was like we were walking on eggshells, trying not to offend each other. No one would say, [...] "Turn your guitar down," [...] or, [...] "Turn the drums down." [...] So we ended up getting a democratic mix, {{and a lot of times}} democratic mixes equal bad mixes. And I feel <b>Steady</b> <b>Diet</b> is <b>a</b> classic example of us being very conservative, although a lot of people think it's our best record." ...|$|R

50|$|Toward {{the end of}} the {{monotonous}} winter {{they spent}} at Fort Clatsop, the men were desperate to return east.

5000|$|The lyrical {{content of}} <b>Steady</b> <b>Diet</b> is more overtly {{political}} {{than any other}} record Fugazi has released.

While obviously emotional, {{the language of the}} [...] "letter" [...] is more than a little obscure. Brennan's politics and defense of individual rights were largely quite in tune with Fugazi's so [...] "Dear...", on one level, can be read as a rant against abandonment of duty to the liberal block of the Supreme Court.

The other 3-lamp signal has <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> red arrow, <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> yellow arrow and a flashing yellow arrow, with no green arrow; this can be used for either left or right turns, and is used to prevent yellow trap where no green arrow left turn phase exists on the approach. This cannot be done with the circular green without causing yellow trap, because a circular green releases other movements. The steady arrows all have their usual meanings. A flashing yellow arrow indicates a [...] "permitted" [...] left turn, where drivers may turn left without stopping (same as a Yield Sign), but opposing traffic has the right-of-way. The flashing yellow arrow must always be followed by either <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> yellow arrow or <b>a</b> <b>steady</b> green arrow.|$|R

Billboard gave a very mixed review of WABD's daytime schedule, though the November 10, 1948, edition of Variety commented that the schedule was no more monotonous than [...] "the <b>steady</b> <b>diet</b> of disk jockeys and/or soap operas fed daytime radio listeners". DuMont expected that the shows would be viewed by housewives who were too busy to watch complex shows (as noted in the 2004 book The Forgotten Network by David Weinstein). Despite the mixed reviews, the schedule proved successful enough that other New York City stations began to increase their daytime offerings in response.|$|R
