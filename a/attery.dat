Evidence-based medicine now has many imita-tors: from evidence-based nursing, 2 dentistry 3 and public health 4 through to evidence-based social work and social interventions. 5 6 To this growing list, we can now add evidence-based global health policy, a ‘movement ’ that is gaining increasing prominence. 7 8 We are fi rm supporters of this movement.

40|$|Battery {{operated}} auto-rickshaw, {{since its}} advent in local towns of Bangladesh {{has been playing}} significant role in increasing income and generating employment opportunities for the poor urban dwellers. Investment on the mode is highly economically beneficial as it involves an income-cost ratio of 1. 85. On average, income of individual operators from their previous occupations was BDT 251. 75 per day while driving of the mode has doubled it now. In addition, around 21 % of the operators were unemployed previously who are now offered with employment opportunities by the mode. Around 38 % of total operators were intended to migrate to Dhaka if the mode would have not been introduced in their towns. At all, driving of the mode having some clear benefits over other occupations available in local towns has become a popular medium of income to poor urban dwellers.

40|$|The {{development}} of high-performance rechargeable batteries for power tools or hybrid vehicles {{has proved to}} be an extremely challenging task because of the need to simultaneously meet multiple battery performance requirements, like high energy (watt-hours per unit battery mass or volume), high power (watts per unit battery mass or volume), long life (5 - 10 years and some hundreds of deep charge-discharge cycles), low cost (measured per unit battery capacity), resistance to abuse and operating temperature extremes, perfect safety and minimal environmental impact. Despite years of intensive worldwide R&D, no battery can meet all of these goals. The use of lithium ion batteries in power tools, vehicles or other applications were high amounts of energy have to be stored in the battery are limited because of safety risks and the lack of safety mechanisms. A wider use of lithium ion batteries for power tools or hybrid vehicles requires safer battery materials and intelligent b <b>attery</b> packaging concepts. The required physical and electrical properties and safety of the lithium ion batteries are supposed to be achieved by the introduction of new materials, e. g. alternative electrode materials and electrolytes. The focussed applications require new designs for the electrode contact deposition, for the heat management and the combination of the single cells into battery modules. In this paper we will focus on the possibilities to improve safety and high temperature performance of lithium ion batteries. The focus will be on nano-scale electrode materials and alternative electrolytes, especially ionic liquids...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. It is widely recognisedt hat for small stand-aloneb <b>attery</b> chargingw ind-turbines, below lOkW in rated power, the issue of regulating the rotor speed {{is one that has}} not been resolved definitively, especially with regard to the runaway condition. Current methods of regulation work, but are prone to problems. It is desirable to find methods of regulation with reduced mechanical complexity. Building on earlier work at Reading University, a method of blade construction is examined which involves asymmetric lay-up of fibre-composite materials. This may be done in a manner which causes the blade to twist in response to centrifugal loads and thus the rotor speed of the turbine. There is a need to optimise the blade design to exploit this effect to the full. The equations describing the blade twist are developed and expresseds imply and explicitly in terms of blade shaped esignp arameters. Along with an established aerodynamic model, a system is developed for examining the expected steady state behaviour {{of a wide range of}} rotors of this type in order to find the most appropriate configuration. A range of existing aerofoil profiles is also examined in order to select the most appropriate choice and a shortlist of these is modelled numerically in 2 D negative incident flow using an established model. In recognition of the inevitable flexibility of self-twisting designs of blade, a start is made on dynamic modelling of the rotor. A Rayleigh-Ritz approach is used in order to find both static blade deflections under loading and the blade's natural modal frequencies and shapes. A prototype design is developed, commissioned and tested under forced-rotation conditions to validate the twisting and bending models. The predicted modal frequencies are also compared with the results of vibration tests on the blades. Recommendations are made for further improvements...|$|E
40|$|The ideal {{friendship}} in Renaissance England {{was based}} on Cicero’s De Amicitia, where he claimed, “friendship cannot exist except in good men. ”Humanists related the virtues of “good men” in friendship with the courtly advice, so that they restricted friendship within the learned. Education was only allowed to the aristocracy and the newly rising class including the humanists, so they could expect the idea of friendship to sustain their social identity and status. On the other hand, the learned had to compete with each other, and sometimes to fl atter their masters and rivals {{in order to achieve}} social success, though fl <b>attery</b> was defi nitely denounced in both Ciceronian and Renaissance friendship. The Two Gentlemen of Verona refl ects both the humanists’ ideal and problem in friendship. Valentine and Proteus develop their friendship through reciprocal advice giving. However, their friendship is testifi ed when they {{fall in love with the}} same lady named Silvia, a daughter whose father is their master, the Duke of Milan. The two young gentlemen have to develop the ideal relationship with their master, and simultaneously to compete with their rivals both as courtiers and as lovers. Valentin advises and fl atters the Duke, but he cannot be so evaluated as to achieve his love. On the other hand, Proteus advices and fl atter his master to achieve his favour and do the same things to his friend and rival in order to defeat them. Some humanists excluded women from their ideal friendship, but others did not. Elyot and Castiglione argued the court ladies whose virtues are not inferior to male courtiers’. According to them, the court ladies can modestly correct the error of men. Likewise in The Two Gentlemen of Verona, male to male friendship is corrected only through the female advice reinforced by their chastity and female to female friendship. Sexual difference does not matter in true friendship. In fact, regardless of any sexuality, all the friendships are referred to as love in the play. Moreover, the ideal counsel is regarded as “feminine” by the humanists,because it does not offend the listeners, but indirectly moves them...|$|E
