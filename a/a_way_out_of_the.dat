5|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of inhabitants in the Rhondda prior to industrialisation, there are few residents of note before the valleys became a coal mining area. The earliest individuals {{to come to the}} fore were linked with the coal industry and the people; physical men who found <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rhondda through sport; charismatic orators who led the miners through unions or political and religious leaders who tended to the deeply religious chapel going public.|$|E

5|$|Fiona Belli is an 18-year-old {{girl who}} {{recently}} moved to college. While visiting her parents, she {{is involved in a}} car accident, and awakens in a cage in the dungeon of a castle. Her memories of the incident are hazy.

Soon after, she befriends a White Shepherd named Hewie. As Fiona begins to unravel the mystery in which she finds herself, she learns that she is the carrier of the Azoth, an alchemic element, which for unknown reasons is being sought by Riccardo, the castle's keeper.|$|E

5|$|On 31 January, US {{ambassador}} Peter Galbraith unsuccessfully {{tried to}} persuade Tuđman's aide Hrvoje Šarinić to accept another extension of the UNPROFOR mandate, explaining that the conflict would inevitably escalate once the UN force withdrew. This rebuff was followed by harsh French and UK diplomatic responses calling on the UN to ignore the Croatian decision, which resulted in Tuđman dismissing any extension of the mandate. The US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, Richard Holbrooke, met Tuđman and suggested to him that if UNPROFOR was permitted to stay, Croatia could count on integration into the European Union and NATO. As <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diplomatic row, Holbrooke proposed that UNPROFOR {{be replaced by a}} new mission using the same personnel and organisational structure. Following Croatian agreement, the UNSC adopted Resolution 981 establishing the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia (UNCRO), replacing UNPROFOR in the country. The new mission's name was devised by Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations Shashi Tharoor.|$|E
5|$|Scully, who doesn't want {{to abandon}} her Christmas plans, follows Mulder {{into the house}} to {{retrieve}} her car keys from him, and {{the door to the}} mansion slams shut. Inside the house, the agents experience strange phenomena: creaks are heard in the ceiling from the upper floor, and the shadow {{in the form of an}} old woman in a nightgown is seen, among other occurrences. Mulder and Scully reluctantly decide to investigate the floor above them. There, they find a massive library storing two corpses that have the same clothes and hairstyles as the agents, along with two gunshot wounds. They decide to go search other rooms, only to find that every door they walk through is the same library room they first entered. They then decide to split up, hoping to find <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room.|$|E

She {{is one of many}} theologians who identify both as a process theologian and feminist/womanist/ecofeminist theologian, which includes persons such as Sallie McFague, Rosemary Radford Ruether, and Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki.|$|R
25|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 and the search for <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crisis, a worldwide move toward Keynesian deficit financing and general resurgence of Keynesian policies resulted in a new economic consensus, which involved reassessment or even reversal of normative judgments on a number of topics. The Keynesian view receiving most attention has been fiscal stimulus, applied by numerous states {{as a response to the}} Great Recession. The IMF managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn advocated for global fiscal stimulus already in January 2008.|$|E
25|$|Most Tennesseans {{initially}} {{showed little}} enthusiasm for breaking {{away from a}} nation whose struggles it had shared for so long. There were small exceptions such as Franklin County, which borders Alabama in southern Middle Tennessee; Franklin County formally threatened to secede from Tennessee and join Alabama if Tennessee did not leave the Union. Franklin County withdrew this threat when Tennessee did eventually secede. In 1860, Tennesseans had voted by a slim margin for the Constitutional Unionist John Bell, a native son and moderate who continued to search for <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crisis.|$|E
25|$|In January 1918, {{while the}} Iași {{authorities}} were considering <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, Tzigara-Samurcaș handed in his resignation to the Germans. A separate {{peace with the}} Central Powers followed: in March–April, the new national unity government of Marghiloman reassigned him {{to the position of}} Police chief. This posting, made legitimate by King Ferdinand's royal decree, Tzigara kept until November 14, 1918—that is, three days after the Armistice with Germany reshuffled Romania's commitments. During the interval, with only 220 forces under his command, he was powerless to deal with the growing protest movement of Romanian Railways workers.|$|E

25|$|American beat {{generation}} writer Jack Kerouac {{became a}} well-known literary Buddhist, for his roman à clef The Dharma Bums and other works. Also influential was Alan Watts, who wrote {{several books on}} Zen and Buddhism. The steady influx of refugees from Tibet in the 1960s and from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in the 1970s led to renewed interest in Buddhism, and the countercultural movements of the 1960s proved fertile ground for its Westward diffusion. Buddhism supposedly promised a more methodical path to happiness than Christianity and <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perceived spiritual bankruptcy and complexity of Western life.|$|E
25|$|With {{the front}} being stable so far, {{it was a}} good time for Finland to seek <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. At the {{beginning}} of August President Ryti resigned to allow Finland to sue for peace again, which the new government did in late August. The Soviet peace terms were harsh, but the $600,000,000 reparations demanded in the spring were reduced to $300,000,000, most likely due to pressure from the United States and Britain. However, after the ceasefire the Soviets insisted that the payments should be based on 1938 prices, which doubled the amount. This sum constituted half of Finland's annual gross domestic product in 1939.|$|E
25|$|Following Yves Leterme's resignation, King Albert asked Didier Reynders, the {{chairman}} of the Francophone liberal party MR and erstwhile informateur, to seek <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stalemate. At first, the Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep (VRT) reported that Philippe Maystadt or Melchior Wathelet would probably take over, either as informateur or as royal mediator. The Flemish parties felt it was up to a member of CDH to take an initiative; however, the CDH wanted a Flemish politician {{to be involved in the}} mediation efforts as well. It was later reported that, according to observers, King Albert would probably ask Raymond Langendries (CDH) and Herman De Croo (Open Vld) to mediate.|$|E

25|$|Assistant Secretary Bard was {{convinced}} that a standard bombardment and naval blockade {{would be enough to}} force Japan into surrendering. Even more, he had seen signs for weeks that the Japanese were actually already looking for <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war. His idea was for the United States to tell the Japanese about the bomb, the impending Soviet entry into the war, and the fair treatment that citizens and the Emperor would receive at the coming Big Three conference. Before the bombing occurred, Bard pleaded with Truman to neither drop the bombs (at least not without warning the population first) nor to invade the entire country, proposing to stop the bloodshed.|$|E
25|$|Instead, President Johnson sought <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{commitment}} {{that he had}} originally escalated. Politically, this was a little late in coming, but Washington had finally woken to the dire predicament it found itself embroiled in. Johnson attempted to get Hanoi to reopen serious peace negotiations and the carrot in this attempt was the cessation of all U.S. operations against North Vietnam north of the 20th parallel. Hanoi had only sought {{an end to the}} air campaign against the north (Operation Rolling Thunder), but Johnson went one further by calling a halt to all northern operations, both overt and covert. This order effectively ended MACSOG's agent team, propaganda, and aerial operations.|$|E
25|$|The first {{hearing was}} held with the Shafii {{scholars}} who accused Ibn Taymiyyah of anthropomorphism. At the time Ibn Taymiyyah was 42 years old.

The scholars suggested that he accept that his creed was simply that of the Hanbalites and offered this as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> charge. The issue being, if Ibn Taymiyyah ascribed his creed to the Hanbali school of law {{then it would be}} just one view out of the four schools which one could follow rather than a creed everybody must adhere to. Ibn Taymiyyah was uncompromising and maintained that it was obligatory for all scholars to adhere to his creed.|$|E
