5|$|With just a {{few seconds}} {{remaining}} in the first half, there appeared to be little chance that Nebraska would have a chance to score. But Nebraska received the kickoff at its 24-yard line and returned it to the Nebraska 42. Frost attempted a long pass to get Nebraska into position for a field goal attempt, but the throw fell incomplete. Instead of trying <b>another</b> <b>long</b> pass, Nebraska proceeded to run out the clock, and the Cornhuskers went into halftime with a 1714 lead.|$|E

The Lobos responded with a rushing touchdown from running back Rodney Ferguson, but kicker Wes Zunker's extra point attempt was no good, making the score 21–13. Midshipmen kicker Geoff Blumenfeld added a 27-yard field goal to bring the score to 24–13. McKamey scored another rushing touchdown to cap off <b>another</b> <b>long</b> drive, this time taking up over five minutes of game time, but the team's two-point conversion attempt failed.

5|$|Virginia Tech's first {{offensive}} {{drive of}} the second quarter began on an auspicious note as quarterback Sean Glennon completed a 16-yard pass to wide receiver Josh Morgan. Following the play, a Boston College player committed a personal foul, which added 15yards {{to the end of}} the pass. <b>Another</b> <b>long</b> pass by Glennon, coupled with yet another Boston College penalty, put Virginia Tech deep into the red zone, and the Hokies scored on a 5-yard touchdown pass to Morgan. With 8:15 remaining in the first half, Virginia Tech narrowed Boston College's lead to just threepoints.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's first {{possession}} of the game began at its own 32-yard line after Louisville's post-touchdown kickoff. Tech running back Cedric Humes gained 12yards and a first down on the Hokies' first play of the game, and quarterback Marcus Vick completed a 24-yard pass to wide receiver Josh Hyman three plays later to get another first down and drive the Hokies into Louisville territory. After Vick was stopped for losses on two consecutive rushing plays, he completed <b>another</b> <b>long</b> pass to Hyman for a first down. Subsequent plays saw Tech advance into the Louisville red zone but fail to gain another first down. Kicker Brandon Pace entered the game to attempt a 36-yard field goal kick, which was successful. With six minutes remaining in the first quarter, Tech cut Louisville's lead to 7–3.|$|E
5|$|After a long minority, the {{personal}} reign of James V saw the court become a centre of Renaissance patronage, but it ended in military defeat and <b>another</b> <b>long</b> minority for the infant Mary Queen of Scots. Scotland hovered between dominance by the English and French, {{which ended in}} the Treaty of Edinburgh 1560, by which both withdrew their troops, but leaving the way open for religious reform. The Scottish Reformation was strongly influenced by Calvinism leading to widespread iconoclasm {{and the introduction of}} a Presbyterian system of organisation and discipline that would {{have a major impact on}} Scottish life. In 1569 Mary returned from France, but her personal reign deteriorated into murder, scandal and civil war, forcing her to escape to England where she was later executed and leaving her Protestant opponents in power in the name of the infant James VI. In 1603 he inherited the thrones of England and Ireland, creating a dynastic union and moving the centre of royal patronage and power to London.|$|E

5|$|By1929, the {{construction}} had reached Lawrence Township, where <b>another</b> <b>long</b> stretch of highway was built. During1930, {{the construction}} had reached Clinton, Glen Gardener, and Washington. Construction {{of the highway}} progressed northbound, with sections of the Mercer-Hunterdon-Warren route reaching Hunterdon County in1931. The Hunterdon County portion up to the Musconetcong River was constructed for six months, with completion in October1931. Construction of the highway northward from the Musconetcong River started in October of the same year. The mainline construction reached the northern terminus in Buttzville in1932. The route, although the construction had reached its northern end, was not complete due to bypasses around Clinton and Pennington were proposed to be built. These bypasses were never constructed, and during1934, more portions of the highway in Hunterdon County were finished. The route was completed in1935, providing an uninterrupted route from {{the capital city of}} Trenton to northern Warren County.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{north into}} the town of Sparta, NY63 runs along {{the east side of}} a wide, rural valley {{surrounding}} Canaseraga Creek, with NY36 and I-390 following the west side. The route eventually reaches the town of Groveland and hamlet of Groveland Station, where NY258, a connector to NY36, comes in from the west at the town line. <b>Another</b> <b>long,</b> open stretch brings the route to the vicinity of the village of Mount Morris, where it runs much closer to I-390 and indirectly connects to the expressway by way of NY408 at Hampton Corners. From this point north, the road becomes busier as NY63 is the primary route to the village of Geneseo for northbound traffic on I-390 itself, as there is no exit {{at the point where the}} expressway crosses under NY63. I-390 ultimately bypasses Geneseo to the southeast while NY63 heads north toward the village, briefly joining with U.S. Route20A (US20A) and NY39 just outside the village limits.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{ceremonial}} pre-game coin toss, Auburn elected {{to kick off}} to Virginia Tech to begin the game, ensuring the Tigers would have possession to begin the second half. Tech began the first drive of the game from its 20-yard line following a touchback. The Hokies initially had success moving the ball, as quarterback Bryan Randall rushed for seven yards on the game's first play, then completed a four-yard pass to wide receiver Eddie Royal two plays later for a first down. The Auburn defense recovered, however, and the Hokies did not gain another first down and were forced to punt. Auburn recovered the ball and began its first drive of the game from its 26-yard line. On the Tigers' first play, quarterback Jason Campbell threw a long pass to Cooper Wallace for 35yards. This was followed by <b>another</b> <b>long</b> play as running back Ronnie Brown ran for 31yards. After the initial shock of the Auburn offense, the Virginia Tech defense firmed up, and Auburn's next three plays were stopped for losses or minimal gains. Facing a fourth down at the Virginia Tech six-yard line, Auburn sent in kicker John Vaughn, who kicked a 23-yard field goal for the game's first points. With 8:35 remaining in the first quarter, Auburn took an early 3–0 lead.|$|E

5|$|Following the post-field goal kickoff, the Virginia Tech offense {{attempted}} to answer Auburn's quick score. Unfortunately for the Hokies, their second drive fared {{even worse than}} the first. Tech committed a 10-yard penalty, suffered an eight-yard loss on a play, then had a Bryan Randall pass intercepted by Auburn safety Junior Rosegreen. Rosegreen returned the ball 31 yards, and put Auburn's offense into good field position for its second drive of the game. Auburn also suffered an early penalty in its drive, but moved the ball with <b>another</b> <b>long</b> play—a 23-yard pass to Courtney Taylor—to recover. Again, however, the Virginia Tech defense recovered to force Auburn into a fourth down and a field goal attempt. Vaughn returned to the field and kicked a 19-yard field goal, giving Auburn a 6–0 lead with 1:06 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1450s, {{a great deal}} of the {{legislative}} business of the Scottish parliament was usually carried out by a parliamentary committee known as the 'Lords of the Articles', chosen by the three estates to draft legislation that was then presented to the full assembly to be confirmed. Before the sixteenth century, parliamentary business was also carried out by 'sister' institutions, including the General Council and the Convention of Estates. These bodies could deal with taxation, legislation and policy-making, but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament. In the fifteenth century, parliament was being called on an almost annual basis, more often than its English counterpart, and was willing to offer occasional resistance or criticism to the policies of the crown, particular in the unpopular reign of James III. However, from about 1494, after his success against the Stewarts and Douglases and over rebels in 1482 and 1488, James IV managed largely to dispense with the institution, and it might have declined, like many other systems of Estates in continental Europe, had it not been for his death in 1513 and <b>another</b> <b>long</b> minority.|$|E
