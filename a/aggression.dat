5|$|Female-female <b>aggression,</b> {{which is}} fairly rare in other marine vertebrates, is common among loggerheads. Ritualized <b>aggression</b> escalates from passive threat {{displays}} to combat. This conflict primarily occurs over access to feeding grounds. Escalation typically follows four steps. First, initial contact is stimulated by visual or tactile cues. Second, confrontation occurs, beginning with passive confrontations characterized by wide head-tail circling. They begin aggressive confrontation when one turtle ceases to circle and directly faces the other. Third, sparring occurs with turtles snapping at each other’s jaws. The final stage, separation, is either mutual, with both turtles swimming away in opposite directions, or involves chasing {{one out of}} the immediate vicinity. Escalation is determined by several factors, including hormone levels, energy expenditure, expected outcome, and importance of location. At all stages, an upright tail shows willingness to escalate, while a curled tail shows willingness to submit. Because higher <b>aggression</b> is metabolically costly and potentially debilitating, contact is much more likely to escalate when the conflict is over access to good foraging grounds. Further <b>aggression</b> has also been reported in captive loggerheads. The turtles are seemingly territorial, and will fight with other loggerheads and sea turtles of different species.|$|E

40|$|Post-conflict {{affiliation}} between former opponents {{or between}} {{one of the}} former opponents and bystanders might have the function of conflict management, which reduces {{the costs associated with}} <b>aggressions.</b> One of the suggested functions of post-conflict affiliation is decreased renewed <b>aggressions</b> directed from aggressors to victims. However, the effect of post-conflict affiliation on renewed <b>aggressions</b> by victims has not been investigated. We examined whether post-conflict affiliations decreased the number of renewed <b>aggressions</b> initiated by winners or losers in captive bottlenose dolphins. Both winners and losers initiated renewed <b>aggressions.</b> However, these <b>aggressions</b> decreased after post-conflict affiliation between former opponents, initiated by bystanders to winners, initiated by losers to bystanders, and initiated by bystanders to losers. Post-conflict affiliation between former opponents is suggested to function as reconciliation. Post-conflict affiliation initiated by losers to bystanders is suggested to function as the protection of losers. Post-conflict affiliations initiated by bystanders to one of former opponents are suggested to function as both appeasement and protection of the opponent who affiliates with bystanders...|$|R

40|$|Bactrocera oleae is a {{worldwide}} olive fruit pest. In late afternoon males form swarms on the windward side of trees. Within the swarm, each male occupies a leaf and aggressively excludes male conspecifics before starting courtship displays. Females display aggressive interactions each other too, {{particularly when they}} are in close proximity of oviposition sites. In this research, the aggressive behavior displayed by both sexes was quantified. <b>Aggressions</b> were composed by wing waving, fast running towards the opponent, pouncing and boxing on the head and thorax of the foe. High-speed videos highlighted that the parameters characterizing the <b>aggressions</b> did not strongly differ between sexes and between residents and intruders. Resident flies won more combats, both in male-male and female-female aggressive interactions. In both sexes, <b>aggressions</b> were more frequent in the late morning than in the afternoon. Among males, <b>aggressions</b> could be functional to maintain single leaf territories in which each fly can perform courtship displays. Through <b>aggressions</b> females could gain and maintain single oviposition sites. Lastly, by favorable fight outcomes B. oleae could also get access to food sources on olive leaves and fruits...|$|R

5|$|Alternate {{theories}} of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to {{theories of}} just war. Aikido, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. Morihei Ueshiba, {{the founder of}} Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume {{that the world is}} free of <b>aggression.</b> One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the <b>aggression</b> of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.|$|E

But we decided to change it a little bit. Instead of the olive branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie. And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the 's arrows.|$|E

40|$|Some plumage {{patterns}} in birds, such as irregularities of feathers, are potential amplifi ers {{because they can}} reveal damage by conspecifi cs and therefore social status. We experimentally manipulated {{the pattern of the}} white cheeks of male great tits (Parus major) in order to simulate the effects of peckings by others and thus investigate possible changes in dominance during agonistic encounters at artifi cial feeders exposed to different risks of predation during winter. As predicted, manipulated birds were displaced by controls from safe feeders, and performed a lower number of <b>aggressions</b> and with lower success, although they did not receive more <b>aggressions</b> as expected from the fact that effi cient agonistic displays can avoid the occurrence of overt <b>aggressions.</b> Thus, our manipulation changed the social status of birds by converting individuals with manipulated cheeks into subordinates. We propose that cheek colour uniformity acts as an amplifi er of the outcomes of <b>aggressions</b> in great tits. Peer reviewe...|$|R
