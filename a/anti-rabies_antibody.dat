40|$|Seventeen Thy- 14 cell clones were induced in A/J mice immunized {{with the}} HEP-Flury strain of rabies virus after epeated stimulations with antigens in vitro. Ten clones with cell surface phenotypes Thy- 14, Lyt-l-, 2 + were {{cytotoxic}} T lymphocytes (CTL) which lysed the virus-infected target cells under H- 2 restriction. Target cells expressed the G and M 2 structural proteins of rabies virus on their surface; however, target lysis by CTL clones was not blocked by <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>antibody</b> or by monoclonal ntibodies to these proteins. All of the CTL clones efficiently and equally lysed target cells infected {{with three different}} strains of rabies virus and were cross-reactive for target cells infected with one (Duvenhage virus) of three different rabies serogroup viruses. Another five clones having phenotype Thy- 14, Lyt- 14, 2 - did not show any cytotoxic activity. The proliferation response of these clones to antigen stimulation was virus-specific and H- 2 -restricted. These clones were able to grow in culture medium without any or {{with the addition of}} low concentrations of T cell growth factor, in contrast to CTL clones, and were considered to be helper T lymphocytes (HTL). Both CTL and HTL clones produced,/-interferon in response to antigen stimulation.

40|$|Post {{exposure}} prophylaxis {{using one}} of the WHO-approved vaccines is the method of choice for preventing rabies. Abnormal immune function in patients with some specific medical conditions, such as pregnancy, chronic hepatitis B virus infection, different types of cancers like lymphoma, diabetes I and II, corticosteroid consumption by patients with rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus, could impair the immunologic response to various vaccines. The immune response to rabies vaccination has never been examined in patients with any of these described medical conditions. This study purposed to evaluate the neutralyzing antibody response after vaccination with purified Vero cell rabies vaccine (PVRV) according to the WHO-recommended Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) "ESSEN" regimen. Thirty healthy volunteers and 50 volunteers with different medical conditions who were exposed to a suspected rabid animal in the 2 nd or 3 rd category of exposure received 5 doses of PVRV under the ESSEN protocol. Three blood samples were collected on days 0 (before the first dose), 14, and 35. The <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>antibody</b> titer was measured using the Rapid Fluorescent Foci Inhibition Test (RFFIT) and an ELISA Bio-Rad, Platelia, Rabies II kit. All subjects reached NAb titers above 0. 5 IU/ml by day 14 after vaccination. On day 35 (1 week after receiving the last rabies vaccine), anti-rabies antibodies were in the protective level (> 0. 5 IU/ml) in both groups. There was no statistically significant difference in <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>antibody</b> response due to the type of exposure (category 2 or 3), and successful seroconversion was confirmed in both groups.

Antibody produced upon stimulation was capable of neutralizing rabies virus. The response to rabies virus requires T cell help because lymphocytes depleted of SE rosetting cells did not respond to an antigenic stimulus.

Similarly, the IFN-gamma serum levels were lower in left-pawed dogs than in right-pawed and ambidextrous dogs. IL- 10, on the contrary, seemed to be an immune parameter, which was not affected by lateralisation.

40|$|International audienceA DNA vaccine against rabies (pGQH) was {{administrated}} to cats {{in order}} to examine different administration routes. Four groups of three cats each were inoculated with pGQH as follows: groupÂ A, intramuscularly (IM), 100 Â Î¼g; groupÂ B, intranasally (IN), 100 Â Î¼g; groupÂ C, intradermally into ear pinnae (ID-EP), 100 Â Î¼g, and groupÂ D, IM, 200 Â Î¼L of phosphate buffer solution (PBS) alone (control group). Blood was drawn on daysÂ  0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, andÂ  180. GroupsÂ A, B, andÂ C received a booster on dayÂ  30. At dayÂ  200 all animals were challenged. A passive transfer of cat sera, as well as a viral challenge, was performed in mice. The results displayed that neutralizing antibody titers were higher in cats of groupÂ C (ID-EP) showing high early titers (>Â  2 Â IU) and the highest titer was on dayÂ  120 (>Â  14 Â IU). In groupÂ B (IN), two out of three cats seroconverted on day 30 (>Â  0. 5 Â IU), the third cat seroconverted until dayÂ  60 (>Â  0. 5 Â IU). In contrast, the lowest levels of neutralizing antibodies were detected in groupÂ A (IM). The control groupÂ showed no anti-rabies antibodies. Groups A (IM) and D (control) succumbed after lethal challenge. All animals from the ID-EP groupÂ (C) survived, only one individual from the INÂ (B) group died. Mice that received cat sera from ID-EP, IM, and IN groups survived and were protected (30 / 30 Â survivors). Mice groups that received pre-immunization sera from cats were not protected (0 / 30 Â survivors). This study demonstrates that pGQH immunization was successful when it was administrated ID-EP, and acceptable through the IN route. The IM route, however, was not effective in cats. For vaccination, the IN route seems attractive due to its accessibility for application, but it seems to activate seroconversion slowly. The best route to promote <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>antibody</b> titers was the ID-EP route. This practical and efficient route should be further studied...|$|E

40|$|Rabies is a {{viral disease}} {{that affects the}} central nervous system (CNS) of mammals and has an {{extremely}} high case fatality rate. Once clinical signs develop, there are very few survivors. Vaccines can protect pets, as well as people exposed to these animals, but the maintenance of rabies viruses in wildlife complicates control. In humans, illness can be prevented by administering <b>anti-rabies</b> <b>antibodies</b> and a series of vaccinations, provided exposure is recognized before the symptoms appear. However, people in impoverished countries do not always have access to effective post-exposure prophylaxis. Due to this and other factors, such as inadequate levels of vaccination in dogs and cats, the annual incidence of human rabies is estimated to be 40, 000 or more cases, worldwide. A few cases occur even in nations with good medical care, typically in people who did not realize they were exposed. Closely related lyssaviruses circulate among bats in the Eastern Hemisphere, and can cause an illness identical to rabies in people and domesticated animals. Rabies vaccines and post-exposure prophylaxis are thought to provide some protection against some of these viruses, but not others. Rabies-related lyssaviruses can be found even in countries classified as rabies-free...|$|R

40|$|Rabies is a vaccine-preventable {{disease that}} causes acute {{encephalitis}} in mammals, {{and it is}} still a significant public health problem in numerous countries. Infected dogs represent the main vectors involved in human rabies. Additionally, cattle rearing close to geographic areas where vampire bats are found presents an important connection with rural epidemiology. We applied two "in-house" enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methodologies, considered alternatives to measure antibodies from vaccinated dogs and cattle, without employing the gold standard approach. The ELISA assays were performed on individual serum samples taken from domestic adult dogs and cows compulsory vaccinated against rabies (147 urban dogs and 64 cows; n = 211). The sandwich and liquid-phase competitive ELISA (scELISA and lpcELISA), considered "in-house" assays, were performed according to previous works. The only statistical methodology that allows this study is the Bayesian approach, developed to replace the conventional Hui-Walter paradigm. For conditional independent Bayesian model (one population, two tests and no gold standard) the prior information for sensitivity and specificity of each test, mode, prevalence and transformed (Ã¡, Ã¢) were submitted to Bayesian inference. The "in-house" lpcELISA revealed 16 - out of 261 serum samples - negative results, whereas in scELISA all results were positive.

40|$|International audienceBackground: Rabies is an endemic fatal {{zoonotic}} disease, commonly {{transmitted to}} humans through contact (bites and scratches) with infected animals. Objectives: During the years 1990 - 2010, six {{patients with the}} clinical symptoms of rabies (fever, tinnitus, buzzing, delirium and hydrophobia), with no history of a bite, were diagnosed by physicians in Iran. To obtain laboratory confirmation of rabies infection, different clinical specimens from each patient {{were sent to the}} World Health Organisation (WHO) Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Rabies, Pasteur Institute of Iran. The first case was a 39 -year-old male veterinary technician who entered his uncovered scratched hand into the mouth of a rabid bovine and became infected. Two years later, a herd of sheep being tended by a shepherd and his two sons were attacked by a rabid wolf. All three individuals were infected when they applied burnt thorny wool to the sheep's wounds as a bandage. Their hands were scratched and then infected through contact with the remaining saliva of the rabid wolf on the sheep's wounds. In 1994, two other human cases occurred through corneal transplantation from the same donor who had died with the clinical signs of food poisoning (according to his hospital record), which probably was a misdiagnosis of rabies infection. Study design: This is a case series study that describes human rabies cases without biting incidents. According to the WHO recommendation, human rabies cases are notifiable, therefore, in Iran, a rabies surveillance system has been established to follow these cases. During the last decade, six patients with no 'history of a bite' were hospitalised with growing symptoms of rabies. The data were collected from each patient by the physicians and transferred to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran, and to the WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Rabies, Pasteur Institute of Iran as the only testing laboratory. Thus, they {{came to the attention of}} the surveillance system. Ante-mortem diagnosis was performed on saliva, cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples that were collected from the first patient by the physicians. Fresh brain specimens from all patients were kept in a mixture of 50 % glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline and transported on ice to the WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Rabies. Results: For the first patient, rabies virus was investigated in saliva using the rapid tissue cell inoculation test (RTCIT) and the mouse inoculation test (MIT). <b>Anti-rabies</b> <b>antibodies</b> in this patient's serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were examined using the mouse neutralisation test (MNT). Fresh brain specimens from all patients were examined using the fluorescence antibody test (FAT) as recommended by the WHO laboratory manual in rabies as the post-mortem diagnostic test for rabies. Rabies infection was confirmed in all of the deceased patients. <b>Anti-rabies</b> <b>antibodies</b> were identified only in one patient's serum specimen. Testing also showed that the rabies virus isolated was the classic rabies virus (serotype 1), which is widespread in Iran. Conclusions: Prevention and control of this fatal disease require a sensitive surveillance system to follow 'suspected' animal and human rabies cases thoroughly through the improved reporting system, which contains the history of exposure, clinical examinations, symptoms and laboratory results.

40|$|Objectiveâ€”To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} various routes of administration and number of doses of 3 commercially produced rabies vaccines on serum antibody responses and protection in mice challenged by intracerebral injection with fixed-strain rabies virus. Animalsâ€” 2, 213 mice. Procedureâ€”Inactivated, adjuvanted rabies vaccines were administered to mice in either 2, 1, or 0 (control) doses via IP, IM, and SC routes, and mice were challenged intracerebrally with fixed-strain rabies virus. Resultsâ€”Vaccination route and dose number significantly influenced serum antibody responses and protection from rabies virus challenge, independent of vaccine strain origin and mouse strain, although mouse age significantly affected results. Extended challenge studies revealed that IM vaccination of mice resulted in the highest serum neutralizing antibody responses and protection levels equivalent to IP vaccination. Even multiple doses administered SC (a vaccination route used in dogs) resulted in poor serum <b>anti-rabies</b> neutralizing <b>antibody</b> responses in mice and were far less protective than other routes. Conclusions and Clinical Relevanceâ€”Findings suggest possible improvements for the current rabies vaccine potency test in mice by using 1 dose, the IM route, and a delayed time of challenge.

40|$|Rabies is a {{neglected}} zoonotic disease {{that has no}} effective treatment after onset of illness. However the disease can be prevented effectively by prompt administration of post exposure prophylaxis which includes administration of passive immunizing antibodies (Rabies Immune Globulin, RIG). Currently, human RIG suffers from many restrictions including limited availability, batch-to batch inconsistencies and potential for contamination with blood-borne pathogens. <b>Anti-rabies</b> monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> (mAbs) {{have been identified as}} a promising alternative to RIG. Here, we applied a plant-based transient expression system to achieve rapid, high level production and efficacy of the two highly potent anti-rabies mAbs E 559 and 62 - 71 - 3.

On cells, the monoclonal antibodies differentiated fixed rabies virus strains (serotype 1) from rabies-related virus strains. The seven fixed strains (CVS, PV 4, PM, Flury LEP and HEP, ERA, and SAD) reacted identically.

To construct the recombinant Fab, mRNA was extracted from MAb- 57 -producing hybridoma cells, reverse transcribed, and then amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by using oligonucleotides specific for immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain DNA sequences. PCR-amplified Fd-chain cDNA was fused, in frame, between a bacterial leader peptide (PelB) at the amino terminus and a 10 -amino-acid peptide tag at the carboxy terminus. The PCR-amplified lambda-chain cDNA was also fused to the PelB leader peptide. The immunoglobulin Fab was then expressed as a dicistronic message in bacteria by using the isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible lactose promotor (lacZ). DNA sequencing was used to define the gamma-chain isotype (immunoglobulin G 1) and VH (VHI) chain and VL (V lambda II) chain gene usage. The recombinant Fab (rFab 57) specifically bound the rabies virus coat glycoprotein, while the Fd and lambda chains, when expressed individually, did not. The binding specificity of rFab 57 was indistinguishable {{from that of the}} intact MAb in direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays; however, the dissociation constant of rFab 57 for rabies virus protein G was approximately 1 log 10 U lower than that of complete MAb- 57 in competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.

After four rounds of biopanning, 20 phage clones randomly selected for their specificity to hRABVIgG, effectively blocked the binding of the inactive rabies virus (RABV) to hRABVIgG. The phage clones were sequenced and the deduced amino acid sequences were derived (C-KRDSTW-C; C-KYLWSK-C; C-KYWLSR-C; C-KYWWSK-C; C-KYAWSR-C; C-KYSMSK-C). Alignments to the amino acid sequence of RABVG showed good match with the antigenic site III (at 330 - 338 aa), indicating that the hRABVIgG antibodies most likely recognize preferentially this antigenic site. The selected mimotopes were able to inhibit the interactions of the hRABVIgG antibodies with RABV in a dose-dependent manner. Subcutaneous administration of phageKRDSTW expressing the RABVG site III mimotope induced an RABVG-specific IgG response in BALB/c mice.
