40|$|The {{financial}} burden of migraine on society comprises direct costs, associated with medical care, and indirect costs, caused by {{absence from work}} and reduced productivity. Recent studies have revealed that direct costs are generally relatively low in Europe, but are much higher in North America, probably because of increased use of emergency room and specialist consultations {{for the treatment of}} migraine. Most individuals who experience migraine headaches take medication (over-the-counter, prescription-only or a combination of both) for their condition; in Europe and North America, most patients who experience migraines have consulted a physician at some time because of their condition. In general, the estimated indirect costs of migraine are substantial and are much higher than estimates of direct costs. On average, work losses related to reduced productivity are higher than those related to work absence. These data demonstrate the importance of the societal impact of migraine and illustrate the need for improved strategies to target migraine treatment.

40|$|Background: Migraine is a {{prevalent}} and incapacitating {{condition that}} affects {{individuals in the}} prime of their productive life, thus generating an economic burden for both society and healthcare systems. The direct annual healthcare costs of migraine in France were assessed over 10 years ago, and the current study updates these figures. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the economic cost (primarily direct costs) of migraine and other episodic headache in France based on a general population survey of headache, the GRIM 2000 (Groupe de Researche Interdisciplinaire sur la Migraine). Design: From a representative general population sample of 10 Results: The prevalence of migraine (including migrainous disorder) was determined to be 17 %. Total annual direct healthcare costs were estimated to be Conclusions: The direct healthcare costs of migraine do not seem to have risen significantly over the past decade. A small minority of individuals with more severe headaches consume most of the healthcare resources devoted to migraine, while most individuals generate relatively low direct costs. The total annual direct costs in France for migraine are almost 10 -fold higher than those of other episodic headache. Analgesics, <b>Antimigraines,</b> Cost-of-illness, Headache, Migraine...|$|R

40|$|Migraine is {{a highly}} prevalent, chronic, episodic condition. The direct and {{indirect}} costs of migraine have a large economic impact. Research has shown that migraine abortive medications reduce healthcare costs, improve health-related quality of life, decrease migraine disability and keep patients effective in the workplace. This class of medications, therefore, has a clearly defined role within a disease management program. However, the role of prophylactic medications in terms of costs and patient-focused outcomes within a disease management program has not been clearly defined. Based on {{a review of the}} US Headache Consortium Evidence-Based Treatment Guidelines and an examination of issues surrounding prophylactic medications, we conclude that the role of preventive therapy in terms of costs and patient-focused outcomes is not clearly defined. Currently, there are insufficient data available {{to assess the impact of}} migraine prophylactic therapy on costs and patient-focused outcomes. Hence, it is premature to state the precise role of preventive therapy in a migraine disease management program. Additional research is needed to better delineate the criteria for migraine prophylaxis, to validate clinical efficacy studies of preventive therapy, to determine the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic therapy, and to determine the effect of preventive therapy on patients' health resource use, health-related quality of life, and lost productivity. <b>Antimigraines,</b> Disease management programmes, Migraine, Patient compliance, Pharmacoeconomics...|$|R
40|$|Migraine is {{a common}} chronic {{headache}} disorder affecting more than 10 % of persons in Western populations. The clinical management of migraine is notable for the variability of diagnostic testing, therapeutic interventions and cost. Standards of care and clinical guidelines for migraine have recently been published or are currently under development. For these reasons, migraine is an ideal disease for a disease management programme. This article outlines the key concepts in developing a disease management programme for migraine which include: setting appropriate goals of migraine disease management; identifying patients for enrolment; providing critical components of care; instituting appropriate referral guidelines; and using continuous quality improvement methods to reach desired goals. Appropriate goals of migraine disease management should focus on decreasing migraine frequency and/or severity and improving {{quality of life for}} individuals who experience migraine. Additional goals may include reducing: overall cost to the organisation; pharmacy costs for migraine therapies; and emergency department and urgent care patient visits. Methods for identifying patients for enrolment in a migraine disease management programme include screening patients in various clinical settings, reviewing pharmacy records or self-enrolment. Key components of care include diagnostic and treatment algorithms, instruments to monitor quality of life, and education programmes for practitioners and patients. The final step in designing a disease management approach to migraine is to ensure that the process is continuously undergoing analysis and improvement.

40|$|Objective: To {{calculate}} {{and compare}} the human capital approach (HCA) and friction cost approach (FCA) methods for estimating the cost of lost productivity of migraineurs after the initiation of sumatriptan from a US societal perspective. Design: Secondary, retrospective analysis to a prospective observational study. Setting: A mixed-model managed care organisation in western Pennsylvania, USA. Patients: Patients with migraine using sumatriptan therapy. Interventions: Patient-reported questionnaires collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months after initiation of sumatriptan therapy. Outcome measures: The cost of lost productivity estimated with the HCA and FCA methods. Results: Of the 178 patients who completed the study, 51 % were full-time employees, 13 % were part-time, 18 % were not working and 17 % changed work status. Twenty-four percent reported a clerical or administrative position. From the HCA, the estimated total cost of lost productivity for 6 months following the initiation of sumatriptan was $US 117 905 (1996 values). From the FCA, the six-month estimated total cost of lost productivity ranged from $US 28 329 to $US 117 905 (1996 values). Conclusions: This was the first study to retrospectively estimate lost productivity of patients with migraine using the FCA methodology. Our results demonstrate that depending on the assumptions and illustrations employed, the FCA can yield lost productivity estimates that vary greatly {{as a percentage of}} the HCA estimate. Prospective investigations are needed to better determine the components and the nature of the lost productivity for chronic episodic diseases such as migraine headache. <b>Antimigraines,</b> Cost of illness, Migraine, Pharmacoeconomics, Sumatriptan...|$|R

40|$|Migraine is {{a highly}} prevalent, nonfatal {{disorder}} typically characterized by recurrent episodes of headache associated with such symptoms as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia and impaired functioning. The attacks may be infrequent and relatively mild; more often they are frequent, severe and disabling. They are 3 times more common in women than in men and occur most often {{between the ages of}} 25 and 45 years, the prime working years. As a result, the burden placed on employers and on society due to lost and impaired productivity is far greater than the not-inconsiderable costs of healthcare. A large variety of treatments are effective in aborting and in preventing or minimizing the attacks. Patients with migraine whose attacks are infrequent and mild do quite well on self-treatment with simple remedies. Those with attacks that are more frequent and severe require professional supervision and may need a long period of trial and error until a satisfactory regimen can be evolved. Unfortunately, a large proportion of patients with migraine, even some of those with severe attacks, have either not sought medical care or have been misdiagnosed and mismanaged. Particularly for these, disease management, an evolving strategy which features evidence-based treatment and continuing close collaboration between the patient with migraine and his/her physician, offers the best approach for control of this disease. Because of the high prevalence of migraine in the workforce and the burden of disruptions and/or impaired productivity that it places on the organization, the employer has a vested interest in using the workplace as an arena for activities (e. g. patient education and improving access to healthcare) that will contribute to the success of disease management in mitigating the impact of the disease. <b>Antimigraines,</b> Disease management programmes, Migraine, Migraine, Patient education, Pharmacoeconomics...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To compare {{self-reported}} healthcare resource utilisation, {{paid work}} loss, unpaid work loss {{and loss of}} effectiveness at work due to migraine in a clinic-based adult migraine population. Methods: The Migraine Background Questionnaire(C) (MBQ) was translated and pilot-tested for use in 25 countries. The questionnaire was then self-administered by patients at a screening visit for 3 phase III clinical trials of rizatriptan [a selective serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine) 5 -HT 1 B/ 1 D receptor agonist] in 23 US and 78 non-US sites. Participants: Persons 18 to 65 years of age {{with at least a}} 6 -month history of moderate to severe migraines prior to the screening visit were surveyed. Results: A total of 2670 persons (54. 7 % Europe, 16. 5 % Latin America, 23. 1 % North America, 5. 5 % other countries) completed the MBQ and had responses which could be analysed. On average, each patient reported 2. 78 doctor visits, 0. 53 emergency room visits and 0. 06 hospitalisations related to migraine per year. Patients self-reported being only 46 % effective while on the job with migraine symptoms. Extrapolation of patient self-reported work and productivity loss for the last 4 weeks to an annual basis suggested that clinic-based patients with migraine lose 19. 5 workday equivalents (8. 3 days due to absenteeism, 11. 2 days due to reduced workday equivalents) due to migraine per year. In the US, the annual employer cost of this total migraine-related work loss is estimated to be $US 3309 (2000 values) per patient with migraine. The levels of self-reported healthcare resources utilised for migraine and work loss were generally consistent across geographic regions. Conclusions: The impact of migraine symptoms on healthcare resource utilisation and work loss was similar across most measures in Europe, Latin America, North America and other countries. Total migraine-related work loss due to absenteeism and reduced workday equivalents accounts for most of the economic burden of migraine, regardless of country, in a clinic-based migraine population. <b>Antimigraines,</b> Cost of illness, Migraine, Pharmacoeconomics, Resource use...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} cost effectivess of a stratified-care regimen for {{patients}} with migraine - in which patients are stratified by severity of illness, and then prescribed differing treatments according to level of severity - compared with a conventional stepped-care approach. Design and methods: A decision analytic model was constructed to simulate a controlled clinical trial in which patients with migraine receiving primary medical care {{were randomly assigned to}} treatment under a stepped-care or a stratified-care regimen. A health service payer perspective was adopted and the time horizon was 1 year. Data inputs were: 1. the frequency and disability of migraine, derived from population-based studies; 2. disability level-specific treatment response rates for over-the-counter analgesics,aspirin/metoclopramide and zolmitriptan as the representative of high-end therapy obtained from an international consensus opinion enquiry; and 3. unit costs of healthcare obtained from UK health service sources. Main outcome measures and results: The estimated 1 -year direct healthcare costs per primary care patient with migraine were pound sterling (Lstg) 156. 82 for stepped care and Lstg 151. 57 for stratified care. Estimates of treatment response rates were 40 and 71 % for stepped and stratified care, respectively. The cost per successfully treated attack was Lstg 23. 43 for stepped care and Lstg 12. 60 for stratified care. Stratified care remained cost effective when tested {{in a wide range of}} one-way sensitivity analyses, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed the cost effectiveness of stratified care to be significant at the 3 % level. Conditional confidence analysis showed that the level of confidence in the cost effectiveness of stratified care varied positively with the case mix, i. e. in populations where the proportion of moderate and severely disabled patients with migraine was greater than 25 %, the cost effectiveness of stratified care remained statistically significant. Conclusion: A stratified-care treatment strategy (including zolmitriptan as the representative of high-end therapy) is a highly cost-effective method of managing migraine in the primary care setting compared with stepped care, delivering improved clinical outcomes at no additional cost.

40|$|Background: The Disability in Strategies for Care (DISC) {{study was}} the first large {{randomised}} controlled trial to compare alternative treatment strategies in the acute treatment of migraine. With 835 patients in its intention-to-treat efficacy analysis, DISC compared a stratified care strategy, where initial therapy was based on clinical need {{as determined by the}} Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) and two stepped care strategies (across attacks and within attacks), where first-line therapy with a simple combination analgesic was escalated, if response had been inadequate, to zolmitriptan, a migraine-specific therapy. Objective: To report on the cost effectiveness of these three strategies from a societal perspective. Study design and methods: A cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken using data from the DISC study, and including both health service and productivity costs. Data were collected prospectively on drug usage (main therapy and rescue medication); resource use associated with adverse events was estimated by a clinician blinded to treatment strategy. Health service resource use was costed using UK unit costs (1999 to 2000 values). Data were collected using diary cards on the amount of time patients lost from work, and on reduced effectiveness at work, due to a migraine attack. This facilitated an estimate of the productivity costs associated with the treatment strategies. To assess cost effectiveness, the differences in costs between the strategies were related to the two primary outcome measures in the trial: headache response 2 hours after initial therapy and disability-adjusted time during the first 4 hours after initial therapy. Results: Although the mean health service cost was higher in the stratified care group (mean over 6 attacks of Lstg 28. 25 versus Lstg 11. 74 and Lstg 23. 15 in the stepped care across attacks group and within attacks group, respectively), mean productivity costs over 6 attacks were lower in the stratified group (Lstg 112. 22 versus Lstg 144. 70 and Lstg 127. 53). The total mean cost over six attacks was, therefore, lowest in the stratified care group (Lstg 138. 95 compared with Lstg 157. 19 in the stepped care across attacks group and Lstg 148. 53 in the stepped care within attacks group), although these differences did not reach statistical significance. In terms of headache response, stratified care was statistically significantly more effective than both forms of stepped care. Using disability-adjusted time, stratified care was statistically significantly more effective than stepped care across attacks, but not against stepped care within attacks. Conclusion: Given its lower mean costs and higher mean effectiveness, a stratified care strategy, which included zolmitriptan, was the dominant strategy and was unequivocally more cost effective from a societal perspective than either stepped care strategy. When the uncertainty around these means was considered, stratified care had the highest probability of being cost effective. <b>Antimigraines,</b> Aspirin, Cost analysis, Cost effectiveness, Metoclopramide, Migraine, Pharmacoeconomics, Zolmitriptan...|$|R
40|$|There is {{abundant}} {{evidence for the}} incapacity and reduction in quality of life experienced by individuals with migraine and also for a somewhat unsympathetic attitude from the 80 % {{or so of the}} population who do not experience recurrent incapacitating headaches. The burden of migraine is reviewed and it is noted that despite the manifest difficulties faced by those with the disease, {{there appears to be a}} reluctance to consult physicians about the problem and a disinclination of many physicians to take recurrent headaches seriously. The role of the patient is therefore to conduct a personal evaluation as to the effects of the headache; to learn about what is known of the causes, triggers and management options in migraine; and to feel empowered enough to consult a primary care physician and, if necessary, a neurologist when the debilitating effect of the syndrome is recognized. It is appropriate to teach individuals with migraine about the more characteristic features of the condition, so that they will embrace the diagnosis and be content to forego fruitless investigations. They should also be aware of the frequent concurrence of other headache types, of the dangers of over-frequent medication, of the necessity of following a drug regimen (as well as dietary and other lifestyle changes) and of the value of prophylactic medications. Patients should also be proactive in educating the rest of the public, in order to create an understanding environment for those developing this condition in the future. With regard to the treatments that can be employed, patients should become educated about the indications for prophylaxis, the nature of the agents available and their potential unwanted effects and about the delay before any response is seen in many cases. It is useful for those with migraine to go to one of the websites where the impact of their disorder can be pointed out to them by means of tests such as the Headache Impact Test or the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale. Differentiation of oncoming severe from milder headaches is valuable if the patient learns the signs that indicate one or the other type; again, patients must know something of the nature of the various agents available, including their benefits and their limitations. They should also be keenly aware of the causes and characteristics of medication-induced headaches, and of the other unwanted effects of frequent ingestion of analgesics. While the new and effective medications for migraine have provided huge relief from this disorder worldwide, there is much more to migraine therapy than drugs, and it is especially in the non-pharmacological field that patients themselves must assume responsibility for the management of their disorder. Education is thus the key to effective migraine care. <b>Antimigraines,</b> Diet, Medical education, Migraine, Patient education, Pharmacoeconomics...|$|R
