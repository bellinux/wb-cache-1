Georges Danton chose Fabre as his private secretary, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> in the National Convention of 1792-1794. D'Églantine voted {{for the death of}} King Louis XVI, supporting the maximum and a law which allowed for summary executions, and he was a bitter enemy of the Girondins.|$|E
25|$|While {{following}} Norton, Somervell {{suffered a}} severe {{problem with a}} blockage of his throat, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down to await his death. In a desperate last attempt, he compressed his lungs with his arms, and suddenly disgorged the blockage — which he described as the lining of his throat. He then followed Norton, who was by now 30 minutes ahead, unaware of the life-threatening episode to his partner.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, he was {{sufficiently}} active in public affairs {{to be returned}} as Member of Parliament on four occasions. Wren first stood for Parliament in a by-election in 1667 for the Cambridge University constituency, losing by six votes to Sir Charles Wheler. He was unsuccessful again in a by-election for the Oxford University constituency in 1674, losing to Thomas Thynne. On his third attempt Wren was successful <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> for Plympton Erle during the Loyal Parliament of 1685 to 1687. Wren was returned for New Windsor on 11 January 1689 in the general election, but his election was declared void on 14 May 1689. He was elected again for New Windsor on 6 March 1690, but this election was declared void on 17 May 1690. Over a decade later he was elected unopposed for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis at the November 1701 general election. He retired at the general election the following year.|$|E

25|$|Once again a free agent, Nabokov {{signed a}} {{contract}} with the Detroit Red Wings on January 20, 2011; the Red Wings were one of the top teams in the NHL at the time, and Nabokov {{signed a contract}} for just $570,000 as a result. However as he had started the season in the KHL, NHL rules required him to be placed on waivers prior to joining the Red Wings, and thus be available at that salary to any team lower than them in the standings. He was subsequently claimed by the New York Islanders, who were one of the worst teams in the NHL at the time. As he had only signed with Detroit in hopes of playing in the playoffs that year, Nabokov refused to join the Islanders, stating that he didn't {{make a lot of sense}} to him why they claimed him. The Islanders suspended Nabokov for failing to join the team, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> out the rest of the season.|$|E
500|$|In November 1677 Andros {{departed}} for England, {{where he would}} spend the next year.

500|$|However, Zotov soon grew to {{be a key}} {{participant}} in the mocking celebrations. After first drinking to everyone's health, he [...] "blessed" [...] the group with the Sign of the Cross, using two long Dutch pipes. On holidays, the games were played on the streets of Moscow, and at Christmas, the Jolly Company rode around the city singing on sleighs, with Zotov at their head, on a sleigh pulled by twelve bald men. Zotov wore a highly unusual costume—his outfit was adorned with playing cards; he wore a tin hat; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> upon a barrel. During the first week of Lent, a procession of [...] "penitents" [...] followed Zotov through the city on donkeys, oxen, and sleighs pulled by goats, pigs, and bears.|$|E

500|$|James {{signed with}} the National Football League's (NFL) Detroit Lions in 1947. He was still {{eligible}} to play in college at the time, but wartime rules allowed him to skip to the professional ranks and play for the Lions, who had selected him in the 1947 NFL Draft. James broke his arm {{in the second game}} of the season, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> on the sidelines {{for the rest of the}} year. Detroit did not renew his contract, and the Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), a team coached by Paul Brown, picked him up. He started at right defensive halfback in 1948 opposite Tommy Colella and intercepted four passes as the Browns went 15–0 and won the All-America Football Conference championship. Brown was pleasantly surprised by his abilities on defense. [...] "Tommy always was a pretty good man on defense at Massillon and Ohio State", he said in 1948. [...] "But his play this year has even surprised those of us who knew him in high school and college. I think we're definitely improved at defensive right half over last year." ...|$|E
500|$|At around 9:30 on {{the night}} of September 27, 1868, Hindman was assassinated by one or more unknown assailants who fired through his parlor window while he was reading his {{newspaper}} with his children. The musket shots hit Hindman in the jaw, throat, and hands, and he died eight hours later due to significant blood loss. Before his death, Hindman gave a farewell speech to his neighbors and political supporters from the porch of his house. With [...] "perfect composure", Hindman told listeners to [...] "unite their courage and determination to bring peace to the people". Hindman hinted at the recent political debate with Powell Clayton as a possible motivation for the shooting and said, [...] "I do not know who killed me; but I can say, whoever it was, I forgive him." [...] He asked James H. O'Connor, the husband of Mollie's stepmother, to [...] "take care of my family and be a protector to my wife and dear little ones". After O'Connor accepted, Hindman stated, [...] "I forgive everybody, and hope they will forgive me." [...] Afterwards, he was too weak to continue speaking, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down on a lounge. He remained there until he died early next morning. The assassination was announced in all major newspapers throughout the state. William Woodruff of the Gazette said Hindman died as an [...] "able and distinguished man" [...] whose [...] "short but splendid career" [...] {{had a profound impact on}} Arkansan state politics.|$|E
500|$|Boulton helped {{deal with}} the {{shortage}} of silver, persuading the Government to let him overstrike the Bank of England's large stock of Spanish dollars with an English design. [...] The Bank had attempted to circulate the dollars by countermarking the coins on the side showing the Spanish king with a small image of George III, but the public was reluctant to accept them, {{in part due to}} counterfeiting. This attempt inspired the couplet, [...] "The Bank to make their Spanish Dollars pass/Stamped the head of a fool on the neck of an ass." [...] Boulton obliterated the old design in his restriking. Though Boulton was not as successful in defeating counterfeiters as he hoped (high quality fakes arrived at the Bank's offices within days of the issuance), these coins circulated until the Royal Mint again struck large quantities of silver coin in 1816, when Boulton's were withdrawn. He oversaw the final issue of his coppers for Britain in 1806, and a major issue of coppers to circulate only in Ireland. Even as his health failed, he had his servants carry him from Soho House to the Soho Mint, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> and watched the machinery,which was kept exceptionally busy in 1808 by the striking of almost 90,000,000 pieces for the East India Company. [...] He wrote, [...] "Of all the mechanical subjects I ever entered upon, there is none in which I ever engaged with so much ardour as that of bringing to perfection the art of coining." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his autobiography, , Dylan {{describes}} first encountering Grossman at the Gaslight cafe: [...] "He {{looked like}} Sydney Greenstreet {{from the film}} The Maltese Falcon, had an enormous presence, always dressed in a conventional suit and tie, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> at his corner table. Usually when he talked, his voice was loud like the booming of war drums. He didn't talk so much as growl." ...|$|E

2500|$|After graduating with {{distinction}} in 1936, {{his plans to}} travel to Vienna to study conducting for a year under Felix Weingartner were delayed by his being called up for National Service. [...] Panufnik recalled how, {{on the night before}} his medical, he heard the national Polish medieval chant Bogurodzica on the wireless. [...] This entirely captivated him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> up late into the night drinking copious quantities of black coffee. [...] The result of this was that he failed his medical examination and was excused from military duties. [...] Instead he used the year's hiatus earning money and reputation composing film music.|$|E

2500|$|While {{still in}} the plains, the party stopped at a ranch to enjoy a buffalo hunt. Although Bierstadt did not participate, he was excited to paint the hunted animals. One {{of the men had}} wounded a bull and called to Ludlow to fetch Bierstadt. Ludlow {{described}} Bierstadt's set-up: [...] " [...] leapt from the buggy; out came the materials of success following him, and in a trifle over three minutes from his first halt, the big blue umbrella was pointed and pitched, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> under it on his camp-stool, with his color-box on his knees, his brush and palette in hand, and a clean board pinned in the cover of his color-box." [...] Ludlow and two other men taunted the bull so [...] "that [...] may see him in action." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{few weeks}} after the death of the Kangxi Emperor, the Yongzheng Emperor enfeoffed Yunsi as [...] "Prince Lian of the First Rank" [...] (...) <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> on the emperor's top {{advisory}} board along with Yinxiang, Ma Qi, and Longkodo. Yinsi was charged with overseeing the Lifan Yuan, the bureaucratic organ in charge of the affairs of the Qing dynasty suzerain lands such as Mongolia. Despite bestowing Yunsi with the highest honors, the Yongzheng Emperor targeted those court officials who were Yunsi allies. The Yongzheng Emperor frequently criticised Yunsi for not performing his duties properly. In 1724, for example, the emperor ordered Yunsi to kneel in the inner reaches of the Forbidden City for an entire night, ostensibly for an infraction committed during his oversight of the Lifan Yuan. In early 1725, the emperor forcibly exiled Yunsi's wife to the interior, and forbid all communication between the two. By 1725, Yunsi had completely lost favour with the emperor, and became the target of trumped-up charges and accusations that eventually led to the stripping of Yunsi's princely title, along with his banishment from the imperial clan.|$|E
2500|$|The {{name of the}} {{character}} Pooh-Bah [...] to mean a person who holds many titles, often a pompous or self-important person. Pooh-Bah is mentioned in P. G. Wodehouse's novel Something Fresh and in other, often political, contexts. In December 2009, BBC presenter James Naughtie, on Radio 4's Today programme, compared UK cabinet member Peter Mandelson to Pooh-Bah, because Mandelson held many offices of state, including Secretary of State for Business, First Secretary of State, Lord President of the Council, President of the Board of Trade, and Church Commissioner, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> on 35 cabinet committees and sub-committees. Mandelson replied, [...] "Who is Pooh-Bah?" [...] Mandelson was also described as [...] "the grand Pooh-Bah of British politics" [...] earlier the same week by the theatre critic, Charles Spencer, of The Daily Telegraph. In the U.S., particularly, the term has come to describe, mockingly, people who hold impressive titles but whose authority is limited. The term [...] "Grand Poobah" [...] has been used on television shows, including The Flintstones and [...] Happy Days, and in other media, {{as the title of}} a high-ranking official in a men's club, spoofing clubs like the Freemasons, the Shriners, and the Elks Club.|$|E

2500|$|Not all judges {{took the}} same view. In Nethermere (St Neots) Ltd v Gardiner home-working ladies {{stitching}} flaps onto trousers were held to be employees {{within the meaning of}} the Act. The leading judge, Stephenson LJ, held that [...] "mutuality of obligation" [...] was {{nothing to do with the}} promise of future work, but simply the exchange of work for a wage, and control over one's job by the employer in the employment contract. Before the case reached the Court of Appeal, a young Tony Blair had been arguing the exact opposite in the Employment Appeals Tribunal, that O'Kelly's case should be followed. Agency workers were presumed to fall outside the scope of protective employment legislation. In 1997, when Tony Blair led New Labour to election victory, the approach to employment policy he brought was one of upholding labour market flexibility. The position of agency workers was reaffirmed when Derry Irvine was appointed Lord Chancellor, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> in on, and gave the leading judgement in, Carmichael v National Power plc. He reasserted his view of [...] "mutuality of obligation". It is notable that the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 removed the power of the Lord Chancellor to decide on cases in this manner; it now being an incursion on the separation of powers within government.|$|E

Now what do you say?’ 6 They said this to test him, so that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. 7 When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, ‘Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.’ 8 And once again he bent down and wrote on the ground. 9 When they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the elders; and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. 10 Jesus straightened up and said to her, ‘Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?’ 11 She said, ‘No one, sir.’ And Jesus said, ‘Neither do I condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin again.’ ...|$|E
