In hot summer weather, a rise in relative humidity increases the apparent temperature to humans (and other animals) by hindering the evaporation of perspiration from the skin. For example, according to the Heat Index, a relative humidity of 75% <b>at</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> of 80.0 °F (26.7 °C) would feel like 83.6 °F ±1.3 °F (28.7 °C ±0.7 °C).|$|E
40|$|Although {{the skin}} of most {{amphibians}} measured to date offers no resistance to evaporative water loss (EWL), some species, primarily arboreal frogs, produce skin secretions that increase resistance to EWL. <b>At</b> high <b>air</b> <b>temperatures,</b> it may be advantageous for amphibians to increase EWL {{as a means to}} decrease body temperature. In Australian hylid frogs, most species do not decrease their resistance <b>at</b> high <b>air</b> <b>temperature,</b> but some species with moderate resistance (<b>at</b> moderate <b>air</b> <b>temperatures)</b> gradually decrease resistance with increasing <b>air</b> <b>temperature,</b> and some species with high resistance (<b>at</b> moderate <b>air</b> <b>temperatures)</b> abruptly decrease resistance <b>at</b> high <b>air</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Lower skin resistance <b>at</b> high <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> decreases the time to desiccation, but the lower body temperatures allow the species to avoid their critical thermal maximum (CTMax) body temperatures. The body temperatures of species with low to moderate resistances to EWL that do not adjust resistance <b>at</b> high <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> do not warm to their CTMax, although for some species, this is because they have high CTMax values.

In the last decade on the world market there is a great interest in dried apple products (commercially called apple chips).

Following the drying kinetics of all three samples, it can be concluded that the cultivars Granny Smith and Jonagold were achieving the lower maximum speed of evaporation, unlike the cultivar Idared.

40|$|The {{application}} of nitrogen (N) fertilisers to crops grown on tile-drained fields {{is required to}} sustain most modern crop production, but it poses a risk to the aquatic environment since tile drains facilitate rapid transport pathways with no significant reduction in nitrate. To maintain the water quality of the aquatic environment {{and the provision of}} food from highly efficient agriculture in line with the EU's Water Framework Directive and Nitrates Directive, field-scale knowledge is essential for introducing water management actions on-field or off-field and producing an optimal differentiated N-regulation in future. This study strives to provide such knowledge by evaluating on 11 years of nitrate-N concentration measurements in drainage from three subsurface-drained clayey till fields (1. 3 – 2. 3 ha) representing approximately 71 % of the surface sediments in Denmark dominated by clay. The fields differ in their inherent hydrogeological field settings (e. g. soil-type, geology, climate, drainage and groundwater table) and the agricultural management of the fields (e. g. crop type, type of N fertilisers and agricultural practices). The evaluation revealed three types of clayey till fields characterised by: (i) low net precipitation, high concentration of nitrate-N, and short-term low intensity drainage <b>at</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> often below 5 °C; (ii) medium net precipitation, medium concentration of nitrate-N, and short-term medium-intensity drainage <b>at</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> often above 5 °C; and (iii) high net precipitation, low concentration of nitrate-N and long-term high intensity drainage <b>at</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> above 5 °C. For each type, on-field water management actions, such as the selection of crop types and introduction of catch crops, appeared relevant, whereas off-field actions only seemed relevant for the latter two field types given the temperature-dependent reduction potential of nitrate off-field. This initial well-documented field-scale knowledge from fields that are representative of large areas in Denmark is a first step towards establishing a differentiated N-regulation for clayey till areas.

This three-way interaction among N supply, water potential, and <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> {{was similar to that}} exerted on leaf expansion. The effects of N supply on stomatal behavior could not be explained on the basis of either osmotic or structural considerations. Rather, effects of N deficiency on mesophyll and stomata were independent and divergent. Stomatal behavior may impart a stress avoidance type of drought resistance to N-deficient plants...|$|R
