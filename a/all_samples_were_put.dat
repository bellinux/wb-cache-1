40|$|AbstractThe {{opportunity}} to use basalt fibre reinforced polymer (BFRP) bars as internal reinforcement for concrete could be beneficial in aspect of limiting the relatively high deformability. The information about long-term behaviour of such reinforcement under prestressing loading {{would be helpful to}} estimate prestress losses, which have to be expected. Obtaining such experimental data and analysing it could be used for further developing of the design principles and procedure for prestressed elements with BFRP reinforcement. A testing rig (referred to as creep rig) has been build to evaluate the behaviour of BFRP rebars in constant loading conditions with a direct correlation to steel rebars and cables. <b>All</b> <b>samples</b> have <b>been</b> <b>put</b> in to equal tension of 16 kN and have been monitored {{over a long period of}} time.

40|$|A biopsy is a {{surgical}} procedure performed {{to establish a}} clear diagnosis of a lesion in order to clarify a clinical diagnostic suspicion. During a biopsy procedure it is fundamental to maintain safe and readable cut margins in order to permit histological visualization of possible marginal infiltrations or malignant transformation of a lesion. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the histological peripheral damage caused by application of a KTP (potassium titanium phosphate) laser during oral soft tissue biopsy procedures. A KTP laser (λ 532 nm) at different power settings and fluences was used to obtain 45 samples from pig cadaver tongues. The samples were then subdivided into five groups of nine samples each. A final specimen was taken by scalpel as a control. <b>All</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> <b>put</b> into test tubes containing 10 % buffered formalin solution, and were examined separately under an optical microscope by two pathologists to evaluate the peripheral thermal damage induced by the laser. In all specimens the cut edges of the incision were free from histological artefacts, especially when lower settings were applied. Statistical analysis showed no differences among the groups. The KTP laser demonstrated surgical effectiveness and caused little peripheral damage to the cut edges, and therefore would always allow a safe histological diagnosis to be obtained. © Springer-Verlag London Ltd 2010...|$|E
40|$|Plant lipids are complex, polar {{and highly}} {{unsaturated}} constituents of membranes. During collection and/or handling {{of a plant}} sample, the membrane integrity gets lost due to plant injury and losses of fatty acids (FA) can occur {{as a result of}} oxidative or enzymatic processes. Quantitative and qualitative effects of various post-harvest treatments on the concentrations and proportions of FA in herbage are not well known. In this study, effects of various post-harvest treatments regarding conditions following sample collection of perennial ryegrass were examined. The handling of the samples, before applying all pre-treatments, was uniform, i. e., <b>all</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> <b>put</b> in a cooling box at 4 °C and transported to the lab for approximately 30 min. The moment when the samples arrived to the lab was considered ¿time zero¿, and the applications of treatments started. We studied effects of two ways of sample handling (dry ice vs. no dry ice), two frozen storage temperatures (- 80 °C vs. - 18 °C) and two durations of frozen storage (1 day vs. 2 weeks) on concentrations and proportions of FA in cut herbage. The effects of the treatments appeared to be small and inconsistent, with exception of prolonged storage, which decreased FA concentrations, and increased the proportion of alpha-linolenic acid (C 18 : 3). Contrary to expectation, using dry ice (rapid freezing) did not differ from slow freezing (without dry ice). Also, there were no effects of storage temperature (- 80 or - 18 °C).

40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{extensive}} background {{study on the}} use of bio-oil modified binder, used in surface dressings in Iceland, was carried out. Surface dressings, or chip seals, are paved by first spraying out binder and then distributing aggregates over the surface before compaction. The bio-oil, most notably fish oil ethyl ester or rape seed oil, is included in a binder mixture to lower its viscosity, enabling the binder to be sprayed out at a lower temperature than unmodified bitumen. In January 2013, severe bleeding of binder was noticed on road sections paved with bio-oil modified surface dressings {{in the northern part of}} Iceland. Following the bleeding, the Icelandic Road and Coastal Administration (IRCA) sent samples of the sections in question, as well as binder samples, for testing at the laboratory of Highway and Railway Engineering at KTH Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden. The conclusions of that study were that the fish oil ethyl ester was highly polar and had solubility issues with the bitumen. This was found to have led to the fish oil separating from the binder mixture and covering the stones, preventing bonding between aggregates and binder [1]. The laboratory tests in this thesis extend on the aforementioned research. Through the background investigation it was found thatWetfix N, an adhesion promoter, was used in the binder mixture to facilitate bonding to the aggregates. Based on these findings, previous work and field experience in Iceland, two sample sets were created. The first sample set included 7. 5 % of either fish oil ethyl ester or rape seed oil by weight, while the second set included 4 % of the same bio-oils by weight. To determine the effect of the adhesion promoter, all samples were tested with and without Wetfix N. Furthermore, <b>all</b> <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> <b>put</b> through a short-term aging treatment to simulate the process during mixing and paving, and tested again. The findings of this study suggest that the fish oil ethyl ester is more suitable for road constructions, compared to the rape seed oil, and that adhesion promoter should always be included when paving surface dressings in Iceland. Furthermore, the samples tested cannot be recommended for field use due to high polarity in the sample with a fish oil concentration of 7. 5 % and too high viscosity in the sample which includes 4 % of fish oil. Therefore, it can be said that the upper and lower limits have been narrowed to the range between the two concentrations tested. To better understand the properties and behavior of the sample mixtures, a complete adhesion test with aggregates is advisable. Viscosity testing of samples which include between 4. 5 % and 7 % of fish oil by weight are recommended and the mixture with the lowest concentration that passes IRCA’s guidelines for spraying viscosity at a desired temperature should be used in practice...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{characterize}} {{the effects of}} silver diamine fluoride (SDF) on caries-like lesion and a multi-species cariogenic biofilm in an artificial mouth. METHODS: Caries-like lesions were created by demineralizing human dentin blocks prepared from extracted sound third molars (IRB-UW 08 - 052). Multi-species cariogenic biofilm was formed on caries-like lesions using common cariogenic bacterial species, namely Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Actinomyces naeslundii in artificial mouth for 7 days. The infected caries-like lesions {{were divided into two}} groups. SDF was applied in the treatment group while water was used as control. <b>All</b> the <b>samples</b> <b>were</b> <b>put</b> into artificial mouth for 21 days. Microbial growth kinetics, architecture, viability and distribution were evaluated using colony forming units (CFU), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Mineral and organic content of caries lesions were evaluated with microhardness testing and Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectroscopy (FTIR). RESULTS: Total log bacterial counts of SDF-treated group were 0. 65 ± 0. 71, 4. 94 ± 0. 07 and 5. 72 ± 0. 19 compared to 9. 38 ± 0. 17, 9. 28 ± 0. 23 and 9. 34 ± 0. 06 in the control group at day 7, 14 and 21 respectively (p< 0. 01). SEM and CLSM observations showed confluent cariogenic biofilm in the control group whilst less bacterial growth in the SDF-treated samples. Microhardness of SDF-treated lesions in the outmost 100 ìm was significantly higher than the control (p< 0. 05). The log [Amide I : HPO 42 -] in SDF treated lesion was 0. 28 ± 0. 06, 0. 22 ± 0. 06 and 0. 12 ± 0. 11 compared to 0. 46 ± 0. 05, 0. 83 ± 0. 36 and 1. 34 ± 0. 31 in the control group at day 7, 14 and 21 respectively (p< 0. 01); showing significantly less collagen I breakdown from SDF-treated lesions than the control. CONCLUSION: SDF treatment inhibits multi-species cariogenic biofilm formation on caries-like lesion. It also hardens the surface of caries-like lesions and reduces collagen breakdown of dentin.
