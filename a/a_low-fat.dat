25|$|There is {{evidence}} that prediabetes is a curable disease state. Intensive weight loss and lifestyle intervention, if sustained, may improve glucose tolerance substantially and prevent progression from IGT to type 2 diabetes.

Reducing weight by 7% through <b>a</b> <b>low-fat</b> diet and performing 150 minutes of exercise a week is the goal. In observational studies, individuals following vegetarian diets are about half as likely to develop diabetes, compared with non-vegetarians. The ADA guidelines recommend modest weight loss (5-10% body weight), moderate-intensity exercise (30 minutes daily), and smoking cessation.|$|E
25|$|Many {{studies have}} focused on diets that reduce {{calories}} via a low-carbohydrate (Atkins diet, Scarsdale diet, Zone diet) diet versus <b>a</b> <b>low-fat</b> diet (LEARN diet, Ornish diet).

The same study also found no correlation (with multivariate adjustment) between animal fat intake and coronary heart disease (table 4). A long term study that monitored 43,396 Swedish women however suggests that a low carbohydrate-high protein diet, used on a regular basis and without consideration of the nature of carbohydrates or the source of proteins, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.|$|E

25|$|After observing in {{southern}} Italy the highest concentration of centenarians in the world, Keys hypothesized that a Mediterranean-style diet low in animal fat protected {{against heart disease}} and that a diet high in animal fats led to heart disease. The results of what later {{became known as the}} Seven Countries Study appeared to show that serum cholesterol was strongly related to coronary heart disease mortality both at the population and at the individual level. As a result, in 1956 representatives of the American Heart Association appeared on television to inform people that a diet which included large amounts of butter, lard, eggs, and beef would lead to coronary heart disease.

40|$|Feeding {{previously}} starved chicks with <b>a</b> high-carbohydrate, <b>low-fat</b> diet stimulates <b>a</b> 9 -fold {{increase in}} both the rate of synthesis of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and the abundance of its mRNA in liver. To define the steps involved in mediating diet-induced changes in the abundance of ACC mRNA, transcriptional activity was measured with the nuclear run-on assay and multiple DNA probes specific to the ACC gene. ACC transcription was low in livers of starved chicks; feeding them with <b>a</b> high-carbohydrate, <b>low-fat</b> diet induced ACC transcription, increasing it 11 -fold. An increase in transcription was detectable at 1 h, was maximal at 5 h and remained high for 26 h. Feeding previously starved chicks with a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet stimulated a smaller increase (4 -fold) in the abundance of ACC mRNA and the transcription of ACC than feeding with <b>a</b> high-carbohydrate, <b>low-fat</b> diet. The half-life of ACC mRNA in liver, as estimated from the kinetics of accumulation and decay of ACC mRNA during high-carbohydrate feeding and starvation, was not changed significantly by dietary manipulation. ACC mRNA was expressed at low levels in heart, pectoral muscle, kidney and brain. The abundance of ACC mRNA in these tissues was not affected by nutritional manipulation. These results demonstrate that nutritional control of the abundance of ACC mRNA in the chicken is liver-specific and is mediated primarily by changes {{in the rate of}} transcription of the ACC gene...|$|R

40|$|Background: Adjustments of {{carbohydrate}} {{intake and}} oxidation occur in both normal-weight and overweight individuals. Never-theless, {{the contribution of}} carbohydrates to the accumulation of fat through either reduction of fat oxidation or stimulation of fat synthesis in obesity remains poorly investigated. Objective: The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the post-prandial metabolic changes and the fractional hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) induced by <b>a</b> high-carbohydrate, <b>low-fat</b> meal in lean and overweight young men. Design: <b>A</b> high-carbohydrate, <b>low-fat</b> meal was administered to 6 lean and 7 overweight men after a 17. 5 -h fast. During the fasting and postprandial periods, energy expenditure (EE), macronutrient oxidation, diet-induced thermogenesis, and serum insulin, glu-cose, triacylglycerol, and fatty acids were measured. To determine DNL, [1 - 13 C]sodium acetate was infused and the mass isotopomer distribution analysis method was applied. Results: After intake of the high-carbohydrate meal, the over-weight men had hyperinsulinemia and higher fatty acid and tri-acylglycerol concentrations than did the lean men. The over-weight group showed a greater EE, whereas there was no significant difference in carbohydrate oxidation between the groups. Never-theless, the overweight men had a marginally higher protein oxi-dation and a lower lipid oxidation than did the lean men. DNL was significantly higher before and after meal intake in the over-weight men and was positively associated with fasting serum glu-cose and insulin concentrations. Furthermore, postprandial DNL was positively correlated with body fat mass, EE, and triacyl-glycerol. Conclusion: After <b>a</b> high-carbohydrate, <b>low-fat</b> meal, over-weight men had a lower fat oxidation and a higher fractional hepatic fat synthesis than did lean men.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Phytosterols found {{naturally}} in plants {{are known to}} reduce cholesterol absorption in the gut. The Chinese diet typically contains many vegetables and not much meat. Therefore, we aimed to test if phytosterols are effective in reducing cholesterol absorption in the Chinese population. METHOD: There were 221 (41 men, 180 women; aged 24 - 79 years) subjects who consented {{to participate in the}} study; the protocol of which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/ Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster. Subjects were randomised to double-blind intake of <b>a</b> phytosterol-enriched <b>low-fat</b> milk or <b>a</b> conventional <b>low-fat</b> milk for 3 weeks. Every day before breakfast and lunch, they had a 273 -mL serving. Active treatment contained 1. 5 g of phytosterol per day. Blood samples were taken from fasting subjects before {{and at the end of}} the study for the measurement of lipid profile. Body weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure were also measured. RESULTS: Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) –cholesterol level decreased from 3. 22 ± 0. 08 to 3. 06 ± 0. 08 mmol/L in the phystosterol group and increased from 3. 08 ± 0. 08 to 3. 20 ± 0. 08 mmol/L in controls. Comparing treatment with control, the decrease in LDL-cholesterol was 9. 5 ± 2. 0 % (P < 0. 001). There were no significant changes in high-density lipoprotein–cholesterol, triglycerides, body weight, or blood pressure. Five subjects (2. 3 %; 4 in treatment group) withdrew. CONCLUSION: Consumption of <b>a</b> phytosterol-enriched <b>low-fat</b> milk led to a significant fall in LDL-cholesterol. This can be recommended as part of a healthy diet for people with mildly elevated cholesterol levels and not at high cardiovascular risk.
