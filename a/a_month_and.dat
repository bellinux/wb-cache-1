5|$|An {{agreement}} was signed with Amadeus in 2007 to upgrade Biman's ticketing system with an e-ticketing solution {{to comply with}} IATA rules, which set out a deadline of 31 December 2007 for all member airlines to switch over their ticketing systems.

However, Biman has not made any attempts to improve customer service through the adoption of e-ticketing, {{although it has been}} able to reduce its own costs. In 2005, Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus ticketing system when the government suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order, after allegations of money laundering.

In 1937, Krichell signed shortstop Phil Rizzuto, who had tried out with the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants, but was dismissed by them {{on the grounds that}} he was too small. Even so, Krichell decided to look at the infielder and was impressed by the way Rizzuto accomplished double plays; his technique reminded Krichell of Leo Durocher, one of his favorite players.

5|$|Battering Aitutaki {{with wind}} gusts {{in excess of}} 185km/h (115mph), Cyclone Pat devastated the island. Approximately 78percent of homes were damaged, with 72structures destroyed. The {{electrical}} grid was left completely offline and supply of water was largely lost. Agriculture also experienced tremendous impact, with most crops completely lost. Damage on Aitutaki amounted to US$13.7million; however, casualties were minimal with only eight minor injuries reported. Recovery efforts began immediately after the storm, with the Red Cross and the Government of New Zealand aiding the local government. A reconstruction plan was enacted by the Cook Islands within <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> subsequently funded by New Zealand. Owing to its destructive effects, the name Pat was later retired and replaced with Pili.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods {{live only in}} the sea, {{and most}} species avoid {{locations}} with strong currents or waves. The larvae of articulate species settle in quickly and form dense populations in well-defined areas while the larvae of inarticulate species swim for up to <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>and</b> have wide ranges. Brachiopods now live mainly in cold water and low light. Fish and crustaceans seem to find brachiopod flesh distasteful and seldom attack them. Among brachiopods, only the lingulids (Lingula sp.) have been fished commercially, on a very small scale. One brachiopod species (Coptothyrus adamsi) may be a measure of environmental conditions around an oil terminal being built in Russia {{on the shore of}} the Sea of Japan.|$|E
