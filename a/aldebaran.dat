5|$|Capella was the {{brightest}} star in the night sky from 210,000 years ago to 160,000 years ago, at about −1.8 in apparent magnitude. At −1.1, <b>Aldebaran</b> was brightest before this period, and it and Capella were situated rather close {{to each other in the}} sky and served as boreal pole stars at the time.|$|E
5|$|In Australian Aboriginal mythology for the Boorong {{people of}} Victoria, Capella was Purra, the kangaroo, pursued {{and killed by}} the nearby Gemini twins, Yurree (Castor) and Wanjel (Pollux). The Wardaman people of {{northern}} Australia knew the star as Yagalal, a ceremonial fish scale, related to Guwamba the barramundi (<b>Aldebaran).</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} exist {{that are of}} interest to astronomers. Taurus hosts two of the nearest open clusters to Earth, the Pleiades and the Hyades, {{both of which are}} visible to the naked eye. At first magnitude, the red giant <b>Aldebaran</b> is the brightest star in the constellation. In the northwest part of Taurus is the supernova remnant Messier 1, more commonly known as the Crab Nebula. One of the closest regions of active star formation, the Taurus-Auriga complex, crosses into {{the northern part of the}} constellation. The variable star T Tauri is the prototype of a class of pre-main-sequence stars.|$|E
5|$|Lutetium, {{derived from}} the Latin Lutetia (Paris), was {{independently}} discovered in 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James. They found it as an impurity in ytterbia, which was thought by Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac to consist entirely of ytterbium. The scientists proposed different names for the elements: Urbain chose neoytterbium and lutecium, whereas Welsbach chose aldebaranium and cassiopeium (after <b>Aldebaran</b> and Cassiopeia). Both of these articles accused the other man of publishing results based on those of the author.|$|E
5|$|Taurus {{became an}} {{important}} object of worship among the Druids. Their Tauric religious festival was held while the Sun passed through the constellation. Among the arctic people known as the Inuit, the constellation is called Sakiattiat and the Hyades is Nanurjuk, with the latter representing {{the spirit of the}} polar bear. <b>Aldebaran</b> represents the bear, with the remainder of the stars in the Hyades being dogs that are holding the beast at bay. In Buddhism, legends hold that Gautama Buddha was born when the Full Moon was in Vaisakha, or Taurus. Buddha's birthday is celebrated with the Wesak Festival, or Vesākha, which occurs on the first or second Full Moon when the Sun is in Taurus.|$|E
25|$|In Siberia, the Chukchi {{people see}} Orion as a hunter; an arrow he has shot is {{represented}} by <b>Aldebaran</b> (Alpha Tauri), with the same figure as other Western depictions.|$|E
25|$|Bowdoin competes in the Standard Platform League of RoboCup as the Northern Bites, where teams {{compete with}} 5 {{autonomous}} <b>Aldebaran</b> Nao robots. Bowdoin {{won the world}} championship in RoboCup 2007, beating Carnegie Mellon University, and finished 2nd in the 2015 US Open.|$|E
25|$|As {{seen from}} the orange grid, 5,000 years ago, the vernal equinox {{was close to the}} star <b>Aldebaran</b> of Taurus. Now, as {{seen from the}} yellow grid, it has shifted (indicated by the red arrow) to somewhere in the {{constellation}} of Pisces.|$|E
25|$|Mururoa atoll, and {{its sister}} atoll Fangataufa, in French Polynesia in the {{southern}} Pacific Ocean were officially established as a nuclear test site by France on 21 September 1962 and extensive nuclear testing occurred between 1966 and 1996. The first nuclear test, codenamed <b>Aldebaran,</b> was conducted on 2 July 1966 and forty-one atmospheric nuclear tests were conducted at Mururoa between 1966 and 1974.|$|E

After her daughter Zo's death, she retires in grief and joins a one-way expedition to an extrasolar planet near <b>Aldebaran.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the Austrians Norbert Jürgen Ratthofer and Ralf Ettl and {{developed}} new nazi UFO myths involving ancient Babylon, Vril energy and extraterrestrial civilisation {{in the solar}} system of <b>Aldebaran.</b> These colourful ideas are integral elements of a dualist Marcionite religion propagated by Ralf Ettl through his Tempelhofgesellschaft (Temple Society) in Vienna, identified as a secret successor to the historic Templars, who had absorbed Gnostic and heretical ideas in the Levant.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} number of stars in the sky, such as <b>Aldebaran,</b> Altair and Deneb, and astronomical terms such as alidade, azimuth, and nadir, are still referred to by their Arabic names. A large corpus of literature from Islamic astronomy remains today, numbering approximately 10,000 manuscripts scattered throughout the world, {{many of which have}} not been read or catalogued. Even so, a reasonably accurate picture of Islamic activity in the field of astronomy can be reconstructed.|$|E
25|$|Open {{clusters}} are {{groups of}} stars that are physically related — gravitationally bound together and {{moving through the}} galaxy {{in the same direction}} and speed. As these groupings are not human constructs, but real phenomena, they do not count as asterisms. Among the best-known and closest are the Pleiades (M45) and the Hyades in Taurus and the Beehive (M44) in Cancer. (It may be noted that, with the addition of <b>Aldebaran,</b> which is in the same line of sight, the Hyades open cluster forms a V-shaped sectional asterism in Taurus).|$|E
25|$|In 2001 Japanese {{researcher}} Yoshitsugu Kunugiyama {{surmised that}} the cover illustration Saint-Exupéry painted for Le Petit Prince deliberately depicted a stellar arrangement created {{to celebrate the}} author's own centennial of birth. According to Kunugiyama, the cover art chosen from one of Saint-Exupéry's watercolour illustrations contained the planets Saturn and Jupiter, plus the star <b>Aldebaran,</b> arranged as an isosceles triangle, a celestial configuration which occurred in the early 1940s, and which he likely knew would next reoccur in the year 2000. Saint-Exupéry possessed superior mathematical skills and was a master celestial navigator, a vocation he had studied at Salon-de-Provence with the Armée de l'Air (French Air Force).|$|E
25|$|Amongst the {{important}} names of Arabic astrologers, {{one of the}} most influential was Albumasur, whose work Introductorium in Astronomiam later became a popular treatise in medieval Europe. Another was the Persian mathematician, astronomer, astrologer and geographer Al Khwarizmi. The Arabs greatly increased the knowledge of astronomy, and many of the star names that are commonly known today, such as <b>Aldebaran,</b> Altair, Betelgeuse, Rigel and Vega retain the legacy of their language. They also developed the list of Hellenistic lots to the extent that they became historically known as Arabic parts, for which reason it is often wrongly claimed that the Arabic astrologers invented their use, whereas they are clearly known to have been an important feature of Hellenistic astrology.|$|E
500|$|In 1718, Edmond Halley {{discovered}} the proper {{motion of the}} hitherto presumed [...] "fixed" [...] stars after comparing contemporary astrometric measurements with those given in Ptolemy's Almagest. The bright stars <b>Aldebaran,</b> Arcturus and Sirius were noted to have moved significantly; Sirius had progressed 30 arc minutes (about {{the diameter of the}} Moon) southwards in 1,800 years.|$|E
500|$|The {{brightest}} {{member of}} this constellation is <b>Aldebaran,</b> an orange-hued, spectral class K5III giant star. Its name derives from [...] , Arabic for [...] "the follower", probably {{from the fact that}} it follows the Pleiades during the nightly motion of the [...] celestial sphere across the sky. Forming the profile of a Bull's face is a V or K-shaped asterism of stars. This outline is created by prominent members of the Hyades, the nearest distinct open star cluster after the Ursa Major Moving Group. In this profile, <b>Aldebaran</b> forms the bull's bloodshot eye, which has been described as [...] "glaring menacingly at the hunter Orion", a constellation that lies just to the southwest. The Hyades span about 5° of the sky, so that they can only be viewed in their entirety with binoculars or the unaided eye. It includes a naked eye double star, Theta Tauri, with a separation of 5.6arcminutes.|$|E
500|$|This {{constellation}} includes {{part of the}} Taurus-Auriga complex, or Taurus dark clouds, a star-forming region containing sparse, filamentary {{clouds of}} gas and dust. This spans a diameter of [...] and contains 35,000solar masses of material, which is both larger and less massive than the Orion Nebula. At a distance of , {{this is one of}} the nearest active star forming regions. Located in this region, about 10° to the northeast of <b>Aldebaran,</b> is an asterism NGC 1746 spanning a width of 45 arcminutes.|$|E
500|$|The star's unusual name {{inspired}} {{the title of}} the 1988 film Beetlejuice, and script writer Michael McDowell was impressed by how many people made the connection. He added that they had received a suggestion the sequel be named Sanduleak-69 202 after the former star of SN 1987A. In August Derleth's short story [...] "The Dweller in the Darkness" [...] set in H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, Betelgeuse is the home of the [...] "benign" [...] Elder Gods. The identity of the red star Borgil mentioned in Lord of the Rings was much debated; <b>Aldebaran,</b> Betelgeuse and the planet Mars were touted as candidates. Professor Kristine Larsen has concluded the evidence points to it being <b>Aldebaran</b> as it precedes Menelvagor (Orion). Astronomy writer Robert Burnham, Jr. proposed the term padparadaschah which denotes a rare orange sapphire in India, for the star. In the popular science fiction series The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, Ford Prefect was from [...] "a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse." [...] In the poetic work Betelguese, a Trip Through Hell by Jean Louis De Esque, hell is on Betelgeuse because De Esque believed that it was [...] "a celestial pariah, an outcast, the largest of all known comets or outlawed suns in the universe.".|$|E
500|$|In Polynesia, Perseus was not {{commonly}} {{recognized as}} a separate constellation; {{the only people that}} named it were those of the Society Islands, who called it Faa-iti, meaning [...] "Little Valley". Algol may have been named Matohi by the Māori people, but the evidence for this identification is disputed. Matohi ("Split") occasionally came into conflict with Tangaroa-whakapau over which of them should appear in the sky, the outcome affecting the tides. It matches the Maori description of a blue-white star near <b>Aldebaran</b> but does not disappear as the myth would indicate.|$|E
500|$|The {{designation}} HD 2039 {{from the}} Henry Draper Catalogue.

500|$|Around AD 150, the Greek {{astronomer}} of the Roman period Claudius Ptolemy described Sirius as reddish, {{along with}} five other stars, Betelgeuse, Antares, <b>Aldebaran,</b> Arcturus and Pollux, {{all of which}} are of orange or red hue. The discrepancy was first noted by amateur astronomer Thomas Barker, squire of Lyndon Hall in Rutland, who prepared a paper and spoke {{at a meeting of the}} Royal Society in London in 1760. The existence of other stars changing in brightness gave credence to the idea that some may change in colour too; Sir John Herschel noted this in 1839, possibly influenced by witnessing Eta Carinae two years earlier. Thomas Jefferson Jackson See resurrected discussion on red Sirius with the publication of several papers in 1892, and a final summary in 1926. He cited not only Ptolemy but also the poet Aratus, the orator Cicero, and general Germanicus as calling the star red, though acknowledging that none of the latter three authors were astronomers, the last two merely translating Aratus' poem Phaenomena. Seneca had described Sirius as being of a deeper red than Mars. Not all ancient observers saw Sirius as red. The 1st-century poet Marcus Manilius described it as [...] "sea-blue", as did the 4th century Avienus. It was the standard white star in ancient China, and multiple records from the 2nd century BC up to the 7th century AD all describe Sirius as white.|$|E
500|$|Lutetium was {{independently}} {{discovered in}} 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James as an impurity in the mineral ytterbia, which was thought by most chemists to consist entirely of ytterbium. Welsbach proposed the names cassiopeium for element 71 (after the constellation Cassiopeia) and aldebaranium (after the star <b>Aldebaran)</b> {{for the new}} name of ytterbium but these naming proposals were rejected, although many German scientists in the 1950s called the element 71 cassiopeium. Urbain chose the names neoytterbium (Latin for [...] "new ytterbium") for ytterbium and lutecium (from Latin Lutetia, for Paris) for the new element. The dispute on the priority of the discovery is documented in two articles in which Urbain and von Welsbach accuse each other of publishing results influenced by the published research of the other. The Commission on Atomic Mass, which {{was responsible for the}} attribution of the names for the new elements, settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones. An obvious problem with this decision was that Urbain was one of the four members of the commission. The separation of lutetium from ytterbium was first described by Urbain and the naming honor therefore went to him, but neoytterbium was eventually reverted to ytterbium and in 1949, the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium. Ironically, Charles James, who had modestly stayed out of the argument as to priority, worked on a much larger scale than the others, and undoubtedly possessed the largest supply of lutetium at the time.|$|E

2500|$|Stars {{of roughly}} [...] become red giants, which are large non-main-sequence stars of stellar {{classification}} K or M.

[...] The replacement and current standard platform is the humanoid NAO by <b>Aldebaran</b> Robotics.|$|E
2500|$|Orion is {{very useful}} {{as an aid}} to {{locating}} other stars. By extending the line of the Belt southeastward, Sirius (α CMa) can be found; northwestward, <b>Aldebaran</b> (α Tau). A line eastward across the two shoulders indicates the direction of Procyon (α CMi). A line from Rigel through Betelgeuse points to Castor and Pollux (α Gem and β Gem). [...] Additionally, Rigel is part of the Winter Circle asterism. [...] Sirius and Procyon, which may be located from Orion by following imaginary lines (see map), also are points in both the Winter Triangle and the Circle.|$|E
2500|$|Chapter nine {{discusses}} the [...] "power of the fixed stars". Here, rather than give direct humoral associations, Ptolemy describes their [...] "temperatures" [...] as being {{like that of}} the planets he has already defined. Hence <b>Aldebaran</b> ("called the Torch") is described as having [...] "a temperature like that of Mars", whilst other stars in the Hyades are [...] "like that of Saturn and moderately like that of Mercury". At the end of the chapter Ptolemy clarifies that these are not his proposals, but are drawn from [...] historical sources, being [...] "the observations {{of the effects of the}} stars themselves as made by our predecessors".|$|E
2500|$|Winter. The winter midnight sky of the {{northern}} hemisphere is dominated by Orion, in the direction opposite the galactic center. Also, one-third of the 1st-magnitude stars visible in the sky (seven of twenty-one) are in the Winter Hexagon with [...] Capella, <b>Aldebaran,</b> Rigel, Sirius, Procyon, and Pollux with 2nd-magnitude Castor, on the periphery, and Betelgeuse off-center. Although somewhat flattened, and thus more elliptical than circular, the figure is so large that it cannot be taken in all at once, thus making the lack of true circularity less noticeable. (The projection in the chart exaggerates the stretching.) [...] Some prefer to regard it as a Heavenly 'G'. The Procyon, Betelgeuse and Sirius triangle is given the name Winter Triangle.|$|E
