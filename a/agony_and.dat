5|$|A Zoroastrian astrologer named Mulla Gushtasp {{predicted}} {{the fall of}} the Zand dynasty to the Qajar army in Kerman. Because of Gushtasp's forecast, the Zoroastrians of Kerman were spared by the conquering army of Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar. Despite the aforementioned favorable incident, the Zoroastrians during the Qajar dynasty remained in <b>agony</b> <b>and</b> their population continued to decline. Even during the rule of Agha Mohammad Khan, the founder of the dynasty, many Zoroastrians were killed and some were taken as captives to Azerbaijan. Zoroastrians regard the Qajar period as one of their worst.|$|E
5|$|In the Emerald City, Glinda {{confronts the}} Wizard with Elphaba's bottle, which he recognizes as {{identical}} to his own. He was Elphaba's biological father, {{and the cause}} of her green skin. He breaks down in <b>agony,</b> <b>and</b> Madame Morrible surmises that Elphaba's powers were so strong because she was a child of two worlds. Glinda orders the Wizard to leave Oz and sends Madame Morrible to prison for murdering Nessarose.|$|E
60|$|O poor mortals, how ye {{make this}} Earth bitter for each other; this fearful and {{wonderful}} Life fearful and horrible; and Satan has {{his place in}} all hearts! Such <b>agonies</b> <b>and</b> ragings and wailings ye have, and have had, in all times:--to be buried all, in so deep silence; and the salt sea is not swoln with your tears.|$|R
50|$|Melancholy was responsible, {{according}} to Burton and others, for the wild passions and despairs of lovers, the <b>agonies</b> <b>and</b> ecstasies of religious devotees, the frenzies of madmen, and the studious abstraction exemplified by {{scholars such as}} Shakespeare or Milton.|$|R

5|$|After {{more than}} a year since the band's last concert, Megadeth {{returned}} as a live act in June 1997, beginning a world tour with the Misfits and touring in the United States with Life of <b>Agony</b> <b>and</b> Coal Chamber. In July, the band participated in Ozzfest '98 but, halfway through the tour, Menza reportedly discovered a tumor on his knee and left to undergo surgery. Jimmy DeGrasso, who had collaborated with Mustaine in MD.45, was hired to replace Menza {{for the remainder of the}} tour. Though initially meant to be a temporary replacement, DeGrasso joined the band permanently after the tour. Mustaine later said that he dismissed Menza from the band because he believed the drummer had lied about having cancer.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, a young Native American man {{is forced}} by several others to ingest snake venom. The venom causes him to hallucinate, {{and one of}} the men, Joe Reynard (Michael Greyeyes) asks him to {{describe}} his visions. However, the poisoned man screams in <b>agony</b> <b>and</b> dies. His body is later found when a construction site is being excavated by archaeologists. A mummified body from centuries earlier is also found; when Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) arrives to investigate, he notices similarities between both corpses. The archaeologist in charge of the dig, Liz Michaels (Amy Steel) is adamant that the site should stay intact for further excavation, but foreman Richard Powell (Garry Chalk) and his mostly Native American crew insist building must continue.|$|E
5|$|A {{tattoo on}} his arm {{identifies}} Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown {{to have as much}} feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one {{of its kind in the}} first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in <b>agony</b> <b>and</b> although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate.|$|E

6000|$|They {{shall not}} return to us, the strong men coldly slain [...] In sight of help denied from day to day: [...] But the men who edged their <b>agonies</b> <b>and</b> chid them in their pain, [...] Are they too strong and wise to put away? ...|$|R

25|$|In February 2017 Taiwan's Ministry of Culture {{announced}} plans to transform the hall into a national center for “facing history, recognizing <b>agony,</b> <b>and</b> respecting human rights.” A corresponding de-emphasis of the Chiang personality cult is underway as proposals for transforming the hall are reviewed.|$|E

25|$|In 2017, on the {{occasion}} of the 70th anniversary of the February 28 Incident and the 30th anniversary of the lifting of martial law, Taiwan's Ministry of Culture announced plans to transform the hall into a national center for “facing history, recognizing <b>agony,</b> <b>and</b> respecting human rights.” Scholars and experts were invited to form an advisory group to help plan the hall's transformation.|$|E

His last performance of the work was in Northampton in October 1920, with Robert Radford and Norah Dawnay, shortly before leaving for his American tour.|$|E
25|$|Heston {{focused on}} epics: he was John the Baptist in The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965); Michelangelo in The <b>Agony</b> <b>and</b> the Ecstasy (1965) {{opposite}} Rex Harrison; {{the title role}} in Major Dundee (1965), directed by Sam Peckinpah. The War Lord (1965), directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, was {{on a smaller scale}} and critically acclaimed, though it fared poor commercially. In Khartoum (1966) Heston played General Charles Gordon.|$|E
25|$|It was {{impossible}} to estimate the number involved {{with any degree of}} accuracy because the lighting was poor, the victims were all tangled together, and everything was covered with a thick layer of black dust. Many of the victims were writhing in <b>agony</b> <b>and</b> were screaming for individual attention. It was obvious from an early stage that the main problem was the disentanglement of a heap of people, many of whom appeared to be in imminent danger of suffocation.|$|E
5000|$|Suddenly, Edoardo appears and {{describes}} how the Countess bribed Udolfo to release him, {{with the intention of}} throwing the blame on Matilde. The Countess flees Corradino's wrath, and he and Edoardo lament Matilde's death (Duet: Da cento smanie, e cento sento straziarmi il cor - [...] "A hundred <b>agonies,</b> <b>and</b> then a hundred more, pierce my heart").|$|R

25|$|On 20 May 1851, Semmelweis {{took the}} {{relatively}} insignificant, unpaid, honorary head-physician {{position of the}} obstetric ward of Pest's small Szent Rókus Hospital. He held that position for six years, until June 1857. Childbed fever was rampant at the clinic; at a visit in 1850, just after returning to Pest, Semmelweis found one fresh corpse, another patient in severe <b>agony,</b> <b>and</b> four others seriously ill with the disease. After taking over in 1851, Semmelweis virtually eliminated the disease. During 1851–1855, only eight patients died from childbed fever out of 933 births (0.85%).|$|E
25|$|I.J. Wickrema {{left the}} union {{at the end}} of 1970 as he was {{appointed}} as a CAS officer. The 1977 government of Mrs.Sirimavo was over and the new United National Party government came into power under the leadership of Junius Richard Jayawardena. He was subjected to political revenge and his close relatives worked in the public sector were transferred to difficult areas. Finally he was sent to the CAS officers pool giving him mental <b>agony</b> <b>and</b> a year later he was retired. He died in late 1979 and his funeral march was organised under the banner of the GCSU.|$|E
25|$|The Damned {{are taken}} to Hell and {{received}} by Demons is {{in stark contrast to}} the previous one. Signorelli has gone to the extremes of his fantasy and evocative powers to portray his cataclysmic vision of the horrible fate, the <b>agony</b> <b>and</b> the despair of the damned. He uses the naked human body as his only expressive element, showing the isolated bodies entangling each other, merging in a convoluted mass. They are overpowered by demons in near-human form, depicted in colours of every shade of decomposing flesh. Above them, a flying demon transports a woman. This is probably a depiction of the Whore of the Apocalypse.|$|E

50|$|To see the convulsions, <b>agonies</b> <b>and</b> tortures {{of a poor}} fellow-creature, {{whom they}} cannot restore nor recompense, dying to gratify luxury and tickle callous and rank organs, must require a rocky heart, and a great degree of cruelty and ferocity. I cannot find any great {{difference}} between feeding on human flesh and feeding on animal flesh, except custom and practice.|$|R
25|$|The Capilla de Calvario or Calvary Chapel is {{the largest}} of the complex and was built between 1763 and 1766. It was also the last that Father Neri had built {{although}} he did not live to see its completion. It has a cross layout and is topped with vaults and a cupola. Its decoration is almost purely Mexican Baroque with monumental oil paintings and groups of painted statues that are placed on the floor, walls and ceiling. The columns contain inscriptions of poems written by Father Neri. The three altars contain the best of the sculptures and enclose the transept. These sculptures depict the crucifixion, <b>agony,</b> <b>and</b> descent of Christ after his death.|$|E
25|$|In mid-2004 it was {{announced}} that the lineup of Bearer, Neuman, Chickie, and Cronin were again rehearsing and planned on playing a show to serve both as a reunion and as the final farewell the band was never able to give. The reaction from fans led to the booking of another show the following night, and on October 9 and 10, the band played two sold out shows at CBGB, alongside opening bands such as Inhuman, Murphys Law, The Distance and Subzero. Footage from both nights, as well as an extensive documentary, was released as the Beaten By The Fists Of God DVD in 2005. Many high-profile members of the punk rock and hardcore community were featured praising the band in the documentary, including members of Dropkick Murphys, Life of <b>Agony,</b> <b>and</b> Blood For Blood. Many former members were interviewed as well.|$|E
25|$|In Sisterhood of Dune (2012), 80 {{years have}} passed {{since the end of the}} Butlerian Jihad, and an aging Raquella remains the only Sister to have survived the Agony. Ambitious young Valya Harkonnen has hopes of using her Bene Gesserit {{training}} to complete her family's vendetta against Vorian Atreides and his entire bloodline. Valya is one the Sisters trusted with the records of Raquella's breeding program, which are maintained by a secret cache of forbidden computers, concealed in a cave outside the Sisterhood School on Rossak. Raquella's granddaughter Dorotea undergoes the <b>Agony</b> <b>and</b> becomes a Reverend Mother, discovering the truth about her parentage and the existence of computers. As a devout anti-technology Butlerian, she assists Emperor Salvador Corrino in his raid on the Rossak school. Salvador has several dozen Sisters executed and disbands the Sisterhood, except for Dorotea's Orthodox followers, who return to the Imperial capital on Salusa Secundus to serve as court Truthsayers.|$|E
