5|$|A {{large number}} of {{chemical}} compounds are known to exhibit one or several liquid crystalline phases.

Discotics are flat disc-like molecules consisting of a core of adjacent aromatic rings; the core in a bowlic is not flat but like a rice bowl (a three-dimensional object). This <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> two dimensional columnar ordering, for both discotics and bowlics. Rod-shaped molecules have an elongated, anisotropic geometry which <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> preferential alignment along one spatial direction.|$|E
