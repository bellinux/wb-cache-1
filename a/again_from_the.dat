5|$|Following the 1973 oil crisis, the {{oil shale}} {{industry}} was restarted in several countries, {{but in the}} 1980s, when oil prices fell, many industries faced closure. The global oil shale industry has grown <b>again</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mid-1990s. In 2003, the oil shale development program was initiated in the United States, and in 2005, the commercial leasing program for oil shale and tar sands was introduced.|$|E
5|$|Although hieroglyphic text may be {{laid out}} in varying manners, {{generally}} text is arranged into double columns of glyph blocks. The reading order of text starts at the top left (block A1), continues to the second block in the double-column (B1), then drops down a row and starts <b>again</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> left half of the double column (A2), and thus continues in zig-zag fashion. Once the bottom is reached, the inscription continues from the top left of the next double column. Where an inscription ends in a single (unpaired) column, this final column is usually read straight downwards.|$|E
5|$|During Gladbach's opening {{match of}} the 2013–14 season against Bayern Munich, Domínguez conceded a penalty when he handled {{the ball in}} the box. Thomas Müller's {{resultant}} penalty was saved by goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen but Domínguez handled <b>again</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rebound, giving away a second penalty which was duly converted by David Alaba. Gladbach ultimately lost the match 3–1. It was an injury-disrupted season for Domínguez, though, as early in October he suffered a broken collarbone and dislocated shoulder. He managed just 22 appearances for the campaign, and 34 in the next before a spate of back injuries severely curtailed his playing time in the seasons that followed.|$|E

5|$|Proposals for {{electrification}} of the Meråker Line {{have been}} made since the 1940s. By then the Swedish side had been electrified. This was initially desired also by NSB {{in an effort to}} cut the high operating costs of steam trains. However, lines with higher traffic received priority. By 1971 the last steam trains were retired and issue of electrification for marginal lines were shelved. The issue was pressed by regional bodies from 1978 and 1992, and then <b>again</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 2000s. This time the issue was successful and in 2013 the Parliament of Norway approved the electrification of the Meråker Line and the section from Trondheim to Steinkjer. The plan is to start the physical construction in 2017 and finish by 2022.|$|E
5|$|SS Engadine {{was laid}} down by William Denny and Brothers at their Dumbarton, Scotland {{shipyard}} as a fast packet for the South East and Chatham Railway's Folkestone-Boulogne run. The ship was launched on 23 September 1911 and completed later that year. She was requisitioned for service by the Admiralty on 11 August 1914, and was commissioned on 1 September after she was modified to handle seaplanes by Chatham Dockyard. Three canvas hangars were installed, one forward and two aft, {{and there was no}} flight deck, the aircraft being lowered onto the sea for takeoff and recovered <b>again</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sea after landing by newly installed derricks. In 1918 her crew numbered 197 officers and enlisted men, including 53 aviation personnel.|$|E

5|$|The castle was rebuilt in {{the late}} 16th century. A new five-storey east range was built {{into the side of}} the rock, and the {{gatehouse}} was rebuilt, this time with a permanent stone bridge. The upper part of the east range was renovated in 1622, with renaissance details and carving to door and window surrounds. Roslin suffered <b>again</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> artillery of Cromwell’s commander in Scotland, General Monck, in 1650. It was further damaged by a Reforming mob in 1688.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{original}} Mass Effect, where weapons overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods, {{the weapons of}} Mass Effect 2 have a finite magazine and must be reloaded after {{a certain number of}} shots. Shepard and the squad members are protected by a damage-absorbing shield. When the shield is fully depleted, further damage reduces the hit points of a secondary health meter. Both the shield bar and health meter automatically regenerate when not taking fire for a brief period. The player can revive fallen squad members {{with the use of the}} Unity power. However, if Shepard dies, the player must start the game <b>again</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> last saved point.|$|E
5|$|After their disappointing {{run in the}} World Cup, Saeed {{rejoined the}} team in the 1986 Asian Games where he scored a goal against Oman in Iraq's first match which ended 4–0 and another one against the UAE in the 2–1 defeat. He missed the Iraq's 5–1 win over Pakistan and the quarterfinal with Saudi Arabia which ended in a 1–1 draw, leading the match to {{penalties}} where Iraq lost 9–8. Saeed appeared in all of Iraq's matches in the 1988 Summer Olympics qualifiers and scored four goals: three against Jordan and one against Qatar, getting qualified to the Summer Olympics {{for the third time}} in the row where they were knocked out <b>again</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> group stage after finishing 3rd in the Group B table. 1988 was the first year where Saeed didn't score any goal since his debut year in 1976.|$|E

5|$|On 1 April 1958 the 95th Infantry Division was redesignated as the 95th Division (Training) {{and a major}} {{reorganization}} of mission assignments was underway. Personnel trained for infantry combat, field artillery, military police and combat support roles were now to undergo re-training {{to enable them to}} train others. The division had a new role as one of the 13 Training Divisions in the Army Reserve. The same year the division's size increased as the 291st Regiment was reassigned <b>again</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 75th and was redesignated as 291st Regiment (Advanced Individual Training). With the {{reorganization of}} the division all of the regiments were redesignated. The 95th Divisional Artillery became the 95th Regiment (Common Specialist Training) with headquarters at Shreveport, Louisiana. The 377th became the 377th Regiment (Basic Combat Training), as did the 378th and 379th, and all were reassigned new training sites. In 1966, the division received a distinctive unit insignia.|$|E
5|$|On 13 September 1911, Scott {{revealed}} {{his plans for}} the South Pole march. Sixteen men would set out, using the two remaining motor sledges, ponies and dogs for the Barrier stage of the journey, which would bring them to the Beardmore Glacier. At this point the dogs would return to base and the ponies would be shot for food. Thereafter, twelve men in three groups would ascend the glacier and begin the crossing of the polar plateau, using man-hauling. Only one of these groups would carry on to the pole; the supporting groups would be sent back at specified latitudes. The composition of the final polar group would be decided by Scott during the journey. For the return journey, Scott ordered that the dogs teams set off <b>again</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> base camp to replenish depots and meet the Polar party between latitude 82 and 82.30 on 1 March to assist the party home.|$|E
5|$|Stage directors, unaided by {{post-production}} {{effects and}} camera tricks, have used other methods {{to depict the}} ghost. In the late 19th century, elaborate productions of the play staged by Henry Irving employed {{a wide variety of}} approaches for this task. In 1877 a green silhouette was used to create a ghostlike image; ten years later a trick chair was used to allow an actor to appear {{in the middle of the}} scene, and then <b>again</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> midst of the audience. In 1895 a shaft of blue light served to indicate the presence of Banquo's spirit. In 1933 a Russian director named Theodore Komisarjevsky staged a modern retelling of the play (Banquo and Macbeth were told of their future through palmistry); he used Macbeth's shadow as the ghost. In 1936 Orson Welles directed the Federal Theatre Project production of the play, with an African-American cast that included Canada Lee in the role of Banquo.|$|E

5|$|The {{space station}} {{is divided into}} {{multiple}} sections connected by trams and elevators. Each section is composed {{of a set of}} rooms and corridors separated by doors. Some doors require certain actions to be performed first before entry is allowed. For example, some doors require a keycard or a numbered entry code, while others need to be cut with a variety of welding torches or hacked using an electronic device. The player may also encounter computer terminals {{that can be used to}} access information or trigger in-game actions like disabling security cameras or manipulating the space station's air-purification mechanism. The game features an automap to help players navigate the different areas of the game. To save their progress, players need to locate a terminal in the game and manually insert Amanda's access card in it. If Amanda dies, the player will need to start the game <b>again</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> last saved point. In addition to the campaign mode, Alien: Isolation features a separate game mode, called Survivor Mode, that focuses on short, player-versus-alien scenarios. In each scenario, the player needs to complete a set of objectives while avoiding the alien under a time limit.|$|E
5|$|Weapons {{range from}} pistols to shotguns, assault rifles, and sniper rifles. Although {{all of them}} have {{unlimited}} ammunition, they overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods. In addition, the player can use grenades which latch onto targets or flat surfaces to be remotely detonated. Shepard and the squad members are protected by a health bar and damage-absorbing shields. The health bar only takes damage once the shields have been destroyed, but environmental hazards like heat or toxic agents may directly affect the health bar if they are not negated entirely by wearing appropriate armor. The health bar can be restored with the use of items called Medi-gels, while shields automatically regenerate when not taking fire for a brief period. Some talents and equipment items can improve the healing rate or shield regeneration. The player can revive fallen squad members {{with the use of the}} Unity talent. However, if Shepard dies, the player must start the game <b>again</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> last saved point.|$|E
5|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the lack of a perceived threat against the United States came drastic cuts to the defense budget and the battleships were deemed uneconomical; as a result, Iowa was decommissioned for the last time on 26 October 1990, after a total of 19 years of commissioned service. She {{was the first of the}} reactivated battleships to be decommissioned, and this was done earlier than originally planned as a result of the damaged turret. Iowa was originally berthed at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and later at Naval Station Newport in Newport, Rhode Island from 24 September 1998 to 8 March 2001, when the ship began her journey under tow to California. The ship arrived in Suisun Bay near San Francisco on 21 April 2001 and joined the reserve fleet there, where she remained in reserve until struck <b>again</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Naval Vessel Register in March 2006. She and her sister ships had been struck previously in 1995. She remained at the Suisun Bay anchorage until November 2011.|$|E

5|$|A month later, Holroyd {{signed for}} Conference National side Cambridge United on a one-year contract, with {{the option of}} a further year. Holroyd made his debut for Cambridge in the club's 3–0 away win at Eastbourne Borough, coming on as a 79th-minute {{substitute}} and scoring five minutes later to give Cambridge a three-goal lead. After scoring on his debut, Holroyd went sixteen games without scoring, ending his goal drought in a 4–0 victory over Salisbury City in December 2008. In February 2009, Holroyd scored in successive away victories for Cambridge, scoring from the penalty spot against Rushden & Diamonds, before scoring twice away at Kidderminster Harriers. A month later, he scored three goals within the space of three days, scoring two second-half goals in Cambridge's 2–0 win at Barrow, as well as netting against Northwich Victoria. Holroyd scored his ninth goal of the season from the penalty spot as Cambridge came from a goal behind to beat Eastbourne Borough 2–1. Two days later, he scored once more, <b>again</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> penalty spot, this time away at Kettering Town. Holroyd also featured in all three of Cambridge's play-off games, coming on as an 80th-minute substitute in Cambridge's 2–0 loss in the final to Torquay United. He played a total of 43 times for Cambridge during the campaign, scoring ten goals. In May 2009, Cambridge United exercised the option to extend the contract of Holroyd for the following season.|$|E
5|$|Frank Williams led an {{abortive}} {{protest against}} the car at the Argentine Grand Prix, objecting to {{the flexibility of the}} fixed skirts used to seal the underside of the car, which allowed them to replicate the effect of a sliding skirt. At the following race, the scrutineers rejected the flexible skirts. Brabham replaced them with stiffer material from one of the other teams for the race, which Piquet won. As the season progressed, other teams developed their own lowering systems—a front spring and cylinder were stolen from the Brabham garage in Argentina— but after a rule clarification from FISA many cars were lowered by the driver pressing a switch, a development that Murray found frustrating in light of Brabham's efforts to develop a system that he considered legal. The cars ran on Goodyear tyres <b>again</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sixth round of the championship; motorsport author Doug Nye believes this cost the BT49s good results at several races while the American company adapted to the latest Formula One developments. Despite the virtually solid suspension now required to maintain a consistent ride height, which put components under greater strain, Piquet built a championship challenge on the back of consistent reliability: {{by the end of the}} season, his BT49Cs had finished 10 of 15 races, with only one mechanical failure. Piquet finished fifth at the final race of the season—the Caesars Palace Grand Prix—to take the title from Carlos Reutemann in a Williams FW07 by one point.|$|E
