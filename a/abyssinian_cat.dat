"Thesis supervisor: Dr. Jinglu Tan. In this study, a mathematical model is developed to describe the ion transport activities associated with the response of rod photoreceptor to light stimulus. In the model, the cell body is modeled as two capacitors connected via the connecting cilium. Roles of different ion channels during a photoreceptor light response are analyzed, and the relations between changes in ion concentration and response currents are assessed. Methods are developed for computing the membrane potential from ion concentrations and relating the material and electrical resistances. The steady state under different conditions can be uniquely defined with only three measured values. The model can effectively describe the rod photoreceptor response to different light stimuli. Model simulation of the a-wave for progressive narrowing of the connecting cilium corresponds well with published literature on hereditary retinal degeneration of <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>cats.</b> Reductions in amplitude {{and changes in the}} a-wave waveform are observed in different stages of the disease. Changes in the receptor response amplitude may not be measurable till the conductance of the connecting cilium is reduced to a comparable magnitude of the ion channels. The model can provide quantitative information of ionic activities, changes in ion concentrations and membrane voltage in the outer segment and the inner compartment. The ionic environment is found to be different between the outer segment and the inner compartment. During receptor response, changes in the outer segment appear to be stronger and quicker than those in the inner compartment. Reductions in the connecting cilium transport can reset the dark resting state. Includes bibliographical references (pages 87 - 91) ...|$|R

40|$|In humans, PK {{deficiency}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common hereditary forms of haemolytic anaemia caused by an enzymopathy. PK deficiency has also been described in several canine breeds. In 1992, the first case of feline PK deficiency has been described in the United States in an <b>Abyssinian</b> male <b>cat</b> and in 2002 the first case was described in Germany. Since then, the disease was identified in other Abyssinians, Somalis, and a few domestic shorthair cats. Since only limited clinical data has been published until now, the objective of this study was to evaluate clinical signs, laboratory parameters, and the progression of the disease in PK deficient cats. Moreover the prevalence of PK deficiency in Germany and other European countries should be evaluated. The progression of the disease in affected cats was evaluated with a questionnaire and all available laboratory parameters were analysed. PK DNA test results of 503 Somali and <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>cats</b> from Germany and other European countries were available. 7. 5 % were homozygous affected, 23. 3 % were heterozygous carriers, and 69. 2 % had no mutation of the PK allele. Affected cats were identified in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Finland, and the Netherlands. The distribution of affected cats, carriers and healthy cats was similar in both breeds and showed no remarkable difference between males and females. The progression of the disease of 26 PK deficient cats could be followed over a time of 0. 8 to 11. 3 years (median 4. 2). In 11 cats, the owners did not notice any signs of disease up to an age of 0. 8 to 7. 8 years (median 4. 4). 15 cats started displaying various clinical signs at ages ranging from 0. 1 to 5 years (median 1. 7). The clinical signs included lethargy, diarrhoea, pale mucous membranes, and icterus. Four owners observed a relationship between stressful situations and the appearance of clinical signs. A haematological examination was performed for 22 PK deficient cats and the CBC revealed anaemia with PCV values of 0. 13 - 0. 31 l/l (median 0. 28) in 16 cats. In 12 cats, the owners noticed no signs of disease and 4 cats were clinically healthy despite PCV values of 0. 25 – 0. 29 l/l. In 5 of 14 cats with follow-up examinations the PCV was below the reference range in every sample, 6 other cats had periods with normal PCV values as well as periods with PCV values below the reference range and 3 cats did not display anaemia at any time and had a stable PCV over a time period of 1, 2. 9, and 3. 8 years. The absolute number of aggregated reticulocytes was increased in 95 % of the cats. In contrast to cats suffering from the disease “Increased osmotic fragility of erythrocytes”, the mean erythrocytic osmotic fragility of most cats suffering from PK deficiency was within the reference range. Therefore, the osmotic fragility test can be useful to differentiate between these two diseases. 44 % of the cats displayed mild to severe hyperbilirubinaemia and in another 44 % at least one liver enzyme was increased. Hyperglobulinaemia was present in 88 % of the cats. 13 of 30 affected cats died or were euthanised at ages ranging from 1. 3 – 11. 3 years (median 4. 8), the others were alive until to an age of 0. 8 – 7. 8 years (median 4. 3). Nine of 15 cats with clinical signs were treated by different veterinarians, 6 of them with prednisolon. In 5 of these 6 cats a transient or partial effect was observed, but the number of treated cats did not warrant any conclusions. One cat did develop a severe haemolytic crisis and required a transfusion. For 3 cats a histopathologic examination was performed. Next to haemosiderosis and extramedullary haematopoesis, a cirrhosis caused by severe iron deposits could be shown in one cat. Based upon this survey, the mutant PK allele appears to occur frequently in Somalis and Abyssinians from Germany and other European countries. Since PK deficiency can be asymptomatic in regard to clinical and laboratory parameters for a long time, DNA analysis in <b>Abyssinian</b> and Somali <b>cats</b> before use for breeding is strongly recommended. Carriers and affected cats should be excluded from breeding to eliminate this disease. Should carriers be used because of breeding aspects they should paired only with healthy cats...|$|R

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					 					Erythrocyte {{pyruvate}} kinase deficiency (PK deficiency) is an inherited hemolytic anemia that has been documented in the Abyssinian and Somali breeds as well as random bred domestic shorthair cats. The disease results from mutations in PKLR, the gene encoding the regulatory glycolytic enzyme {{pyruvate kinase}} (PK). Multiple isozymes are produced by tissue-specific differential processing of PKLR mRNA. Perturbation of PK decreases erythrocyte longevity resulting in anemia. Additional signs include: severe lethargy, weakness, weight loss, jaundice, and abdominal enlargement. In domestic cats, PK deficiency has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance with high variability in onset and severity of clinical symptoms. 				 				 					 						Results 					 					Sequence analysis of PKLR revealed an intron 5 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 304 concordant with the disease phenotype in <b>Abyssinian</b> and Somali <b>cats.</b> Located 53 nucleotides upstream of the exon 6 splice site, cats with this SNP produce liver and blood processed mRNA with a 13 bp deletion at the 3 &# 8217; end of exon 5. The frame-shift mutation creates a stop codon at amino acid position 248 in exon 6. The frequency of the intronic SNP in 14, 179 American and European cats representing 38 breeds, 76 western random bred cats and 111 cats of unknown breed is 6. 31 % and 9. 35 % when restricted to the 15 groups carrying the concordant SNP. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					 					PK testing is recommended for Bengals, Egyptian Maus, La Perms, Maine Coon cats, Norwegian Forest cats, Savannahs, Siberians, and Singapuras, in addition to Abyssinians and Somalis as well an any new breeds using the afore mentioned breeds in out crossing or development programs...|$|R
40|$|Familial AA {{amyloidosis}} is a hereditary trait in Abyssinian cats, {{with the}} kidney {{as the main}} target organ. The amino acid sequence of the amyloid A protein of the <b>Abyssinian</b> <b>cat</b> has been described earlier.

In the present paper, we describe the complete amino amid sequence of the major constituent protein, of two Siamese cats. Siamese hepatic protein AA showed homology with, but was different from all feline SAA and AA sequences hitherto reported. Two substitutions (46 Q-R and 52 A-V) from the Abyssinian protein sequence were identified one of which (46 Q-R) is a non-homologous substitution not found in mammalian SAA, but is present in two bird AA amyloid proteins. This shows the presence of an unique amyloidogenic SAA isotype in Siamese cats Both the Siamese and the Abyssinian sequence are amyloidogenic, thus making identification of amyloidogenic residues difficult. Apart from the apparent inherent amyloidogenicity of SAA, it can not be excluded that certain amino acid substitutions could enhance its amyloidogenicity but also could contribute to tissue predilection in amyloidosis. status: publishe...|$|E
