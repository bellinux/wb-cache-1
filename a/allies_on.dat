5|$|After World War II the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed {{for power}} during {{what became known}} as the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between {{capitalism}} and communism and, according to the school of geopolitics, a divide between the maritime Atlantic and the continental Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO <b>allies</b> <b>on</b> one side and the USSR and its Warsaw Pact <b>allies</b> <b>on</b> the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict.|$|E
5|$|Franz Oppenhoff was {{appointed}} Mayor of Aachen by the <b>Allies</b> <b>on</b> 31 October, but after his identity was leaked, Franz Oppenhoff was assassinated on Heinrich Himmler's orders in Unternehmen Karnival (Operation Carnival) on March 25.|$|E
5|$|Japan {{announced}} its {{surrender to the}} <b>Allies</b> <b>on</b> August 15, six days after the bombing of Nagasaki and the Soviet Union's declaration of war. On September 2, the Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender, effectively ending World War II. The justification for the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is still debated to this day.|$|E

5|$|Allied {{control of}} the Atlantic meant German meteorologists had less {{information}} than the <b>Allies</b> <b>on</b> incoming weather patterns. As the Luftwaffe meteorological centre in Paris was predicting two weeks of stormy weather, many Wehrmacht commanders left their posts to attend war games in Rennes, and men in many units were given leave. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel returned to Germany for his wife's birthday and to meet with Hitler to try to obtain more Panzers.|$|E
5|$|Landing in Oran on November 8, 1942, the 1st Infantry Division's primary {{objective}} was to confront the German Afrika Korps commanded by Erwin Rommel, while its secondary {{objective was to}} support Bernard Law Montgomery's advance against the Italian forces. Eventually, the 1st Infantry Division broke through the German resistance and scaled Mount Djebel. Oran fell to the <b>Allies</b> <b>on</b> November 10 and Juskalian's unit advanced east into Tunisia, reaching the Algeria–Tunisia border by January 15, 1943. There, the task force met resistance from German and Italian troops.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{units in}} the area also defended strongly, but they too were short on {{supplies}} {{and in the end}} they were forced to withdraw further north. Wareo subsequently fell to the <b>Allies</b> <b>on</b> 8 December, who then established a line east from Wareo to Gusika on the coast. From there they carried out further advances north later in the month and into early January 1944.|$|E

50|$|During the mid-1950s, Genovese {{decided to}} move against Costello. However, Genovese needed to also remove Costello's strong <b>ally</b> <b>on</b> the Commission, Albert Anastasia, the feared boss of the Anastasia crime family. Genovese was soon conspiring with Carlo Gambino, Anastasia's underboss, to remove Anastasia.|$|R
5|$|The {{country was}} bombed by the <b>Allies</b> <b>on</b> 27 June 1944, {{killing at least}} 35. The Sammarinese {{government}} declared {{the same day that}} no military installations or equipment were located on its territory, and that no belligerent forces had been allowed to enter. In early July, it announced that prominent signs had been put up at the border crossings by the German command, to instruct German units not to enter the territory, and again reiterated its complete neutrality.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{reinforcing}} Luso-Rhodesian relations, the Lisbon {{appointment was}} designed to secure the African nation a diplomatic foothold in Europe outside of Britain's reach and to help Salisbury find new trading partners and diplomatic <b>allies</b> <b>on</b> the continent. Among other things, the Rhodesians intended {{to make up the}} shortfalls in military equipment caused by the undeclared Anglo-American arms embargo. Reedman, the former minister for immigration and tourism, was also a retired officer of the British Royal Air Force (where he had been involved in bomber research), and an experienced engineer and businessman: all the right ingredients, the government thought, for someone in the position to source European aircraft, weapons and other equipment, while also representing Rhodesian interests in mainland Europe.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 6 April, the German armies invaded Greece, {{while the}} Luftwaffe began an {{intensive}} bombardment of Belgrade. The XL Panzer Corps—planned to attack across southern Yugoslavia—began their assault at 05:30. They pushed across the Bulgarian frontier at two separate points. By {{the evening of}} 8 April, the 73rd Infantry Division captured Prilep, severing an important rail line between Belgrade and Thessaloniki and isolating Yugoslavia from its <b>allies.</b> <b>On</b> the evening of 9 April, Stumme deployed his forces north of Monastir, in preparation for attack toward Florina. This position threatened to encircle the Greeks in Albania and W Force {{in the area of}} Florina, Edessa and Katerini. While weak security detachments covered his rear against a surprise attack from central Yugoslavia, elements of the 9th Panzer Division drove westward to link up with the Italians at the Albanian border.|$|E
50|$|While US$24 million (Bt902 million) was in {{suspended}} military assistance, United States Ambassador to Thailand Ralph Boyce {{met with}} Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont {{in what was}} billed {{as a gesture of}} goodwill by a key <b>ally</b> <b>on</b> Surayud first day at the office.|$|R
50|$|With nine largely {{unsuccessful}} Isonzo battles conducted {{within an}} eighteen-month period to date, Italian Chief of Staff Luigi Cadorna - responsible for launching all nine - became increasingly uncomfortable {{at the prospect}} of German intervention to aid their weakening Austro-Hungarian <b>ally</b> <b>on</b> the Italian Front.|$|R

5|$|Impero {{was laid}} down in May 1938 and {{launched}} in November 1939. The entrance of Italy into World War II forced the Regia Marina to refocus its construction priorities on escort warships, so Impero was left incomplete. After Italy surrendered to the <b>Allies</b> <b>on</b> 8 September 1943, {{the rest of the}} Italian Navy steamed to Sardinia to rendezvous with their American contemporaries. Still incomplete in Trieste, Impero was captured by the Germans, who used the hulk for target practice. Sunk by Allied bombers in February 1945, she was refloated in 1947 and scrapped in Venice from 1948 to 1950.|$|E
5|$|Lacking the {{available}} naval forces {{to launch a}} sizeable campaign in the Gulf, the British authorities attempted to use diplomacy to end the threat. In February 1806, the young Sultan of Oman, Sa'id II ibn Sultan, signed a treaty at Bandar Abbas promising {{to bring an end}} to attacks originating from his territory, but by 1807 the French had installed consulates in Tehran and Muscat and attacks continued unabated with their encouragement. In 1807, Lord Minto, Governor General of India, determined to send ambassadors to the Sikh Empire, Afghanistan and Persia in an effort to secure their support and prevent the French from gaining <b>allies</b> <b>on</b> India's western borders. As part of this diplomatic campaign, the ambassador to Persia was instructed to discuss the problem with the Persian government, but due to French influence in Tehran, he was unable to obtain any guarantees.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 November 1757 the Prussian camp lay between Rossbach {{on the left and}} the village of Bedra on the right, facing the Allies. Charles, the Prince Soubise, {{commanding}} the French, and the Prince Saxe-Hildburghausen, commanding the Holy Roman Empire's forces, had maneuvered in the preceding days without giving Frederick an opportunity to begin fighting. Their forces were located to the west, with their right flank near the town of Branderoda and their left at Mücheln. The advanced posts of the Prussians stood in villages immediately west of their camp, those of the <b>Allies</b> <b>on</b> the Schortau hill and the Galgenberg.|$|E

5000|$|The 2006 {{elections}} {{were the last}} marked by the now extinct [...] "verticalization rule", that forced parties to <b>ally</b> <b>on</b> the state level with the same parties {{for which they were}} allied nationwide.

60|$|Josie was sobered at once by this dire threat, and in {{her most}} wheedling tone begged {{to know what he}} had said. By way of heaping coals of fire on her head he told her, and this {{diplomatic}} performance secured him an <b>ally</b> <b>on</b> the spot.|$|R
5|$|That night, the <b>Allies</b> <b>on</b> {{the south}} side of the river {{attempted}} another crossing. The plan called for 4th Battalion The Dorset Regiment and the 1st Polish Parachute Battalion to cross at 22:00 using boats and DUKWs. Sosabowski was furious at having to give up control of one of his battalions and thought the plan dangerous, but was silenced. The boats failed to arrive until 1am and several had been destroyed or lost en route, so a last minute change of plan mean that only the Dorsets would cross. The small boats without skilled crews, the strong current and poor choice of landing site on the north bank meant that of the 315 men who embarked, only a handful reached the British lines on the other side. The DUKWs and most boats landed too far downstream and at least 200 men were captured.|$|E
5|$|The repairs were {{abandoned}} in March 1945 {{for lack of}} materials and the ship was moved from the dock to Ebisu Bay, Sasebo on 1 April. Efforts to camouflage the ship began on 23 April and she was reclassified as a guard ship on 20 June. Junyōs armament was ordered removed on 5 August and the ship was surrendered to the <b>Allies</b> <b>on</b> 2 September. An American technical team evaluated the ship's condition on 8 October and deemed her a constructive total loss. Junyō was stricken from the Navy List on 30 November and scrapped between 1 June 1946 and 1 August 1947 by the Sasebo Ship Company.|$|E
5|$|The war in Europe {{concluded}} with {{an invasion of}} Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the capture of Berlin by Soviet troops, the suicide of Adolf Hitler and the subsequent German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the Potsdam Declaration by the <b>Allies</b> <b>on</b> 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 August and 9 August respectively. With an invasion of the Japanese archipelago imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, Japan formally surrendered on 2 September 1945. Thus ended the war in Asia, cementing the total victory of the Allies.|$|E

5|$|When King Powhatan is {{presented}} with the captured Smith, he decides, {{at the urging of}} the tribe’s priest Grimosco, to execute him. Pocahontas, having been moved by Smith’s nobility, says she will not allow Smith to be killed unless she herself dies with him. This persuades Powhatan to free Smith. Soon, Percy and Rolfe encounter Smith and his Indian <b>allies</b> <b>on</b> {{the way back to the}} settlement, and Rolfe is immediately struck by Pocahontas, whose manner suggests the attraction is mutual. They speak of love, but Rolfe must soon depart with Smith. Pocahontas confesses her love for Rolfe to Miami, who receives the news with anger, jealousy and rage. Pocahontas convinces her father to dissolve her arranged engagement with Miami, which will mean war between their two tribes.|$|E
5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} to the <b>Allies</b> <b>on</b> 15 August 1945, Singapore fell into a brief state of violence and disorder; looting and revenge-killing were widespread. British troops led by Lord Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander for Southeast Asia Command, returned to Singapore to receive formal surrender of the Japanese forces in the region from General Itagaki Seishiro on behalf of General Hisaichi Terauchi on 12 September 1945, and a British Military Administration was formed to govern the island until March 1946. Much of the infrastructure had been destroyed during the war, including electricity and water supply systems, telephone services, {{as well as the}} harbor facilities at the Port of Singapore. There was also a shortage of food leading to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. High food prices, unemployment, and workers' discontent culminated into a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services. By late 1947, the economy began to recover, facilitated by a growing demand for tin and rubber around the world, but it would take several more years before the economy returned to pre-war levels.|$|E
5|$|After the Kingdom of Italy {{surrendered}} to the <b>Allies</b> <b>on</b> 3 September 1943, the unfinished CB-20 was captured by German forces and completed by March 1944. The boat was then {{handed over to the}} Italian Social Republic where it saw service with the Tenth Flotilla performing reconnaissance and landing saboteurs. At some point between September and October 1944, CB-20 was relocated to its new home port in Pula, where it was captured by the Partisans on 3 May 1945. Renamed Mališan (P-901), translating as nipper in English, the boat was overhauled at the Uljanik Shipyard and commissioned in 1948. The Yugoslav Navy used it for training new submariners as well as evaluating the concept of midget submarines for future use, which eventually materialized {{in the form of the}} Una-class midget submarines three decades later. Depending on the source, the exact time Mališan was decommissioned differs from the early 1950s to 1957.|$|E
