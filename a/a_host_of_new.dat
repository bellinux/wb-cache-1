The General Assembly also passed the Indiana Civil Rights bill in 1963, granting equal protection to minorities in seeking employment. In 1970 a series of constitutional amendments were passed.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the 40 Watt Club became a {{well-known}} regional attraction for music fans, and {{was followed by}} the Uptown Lounge; with the local industry's growth in the 1980s, both the 40 Watt Club and the Uptown Lounge moved to larger spaces, the latter taking over the landmark Georgia Theatre. The early 1980s saw <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> bands and venues appear, while the city's musical subculture became more diversified.

25|$|Compressibility is an {{important}} factor in aerodynamics. At low speeds, the compressibility of air is not significant in relation to aircraft design, but as the airflow nears and exceeds the speed of sound, <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> aerodynamic effects become important in the design of aircraft. These effects, often several of them at a time, made it very difficult for World War II era aircraft to reach speeds much beyond 800km/h (500mph).|$|E
25|$|It {{was in this}} period, too, that English {{folk music}} {{traveled}} across the Atlantic Ocean and became the foundation for and main ancestor of American traditional music.

25|$|These {{changes were}} welcome {{at a time}} when the Escort was faced with <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> competitors; General Motors had brought out a new version of the Opel Kadett/Vauxhall Astra 18 months earlier, shortly after Volkswagen had {{introduced}} the Mk II Golf and British Leyland had launched the Austin Maestro, while the British-built Peugeot 309 had gone on sale just weeks before the updated Escort.

Graphically, Egosoft redesigned everything from scratch. The stations are restructured, {{larger and more}} detailed. Few contain the internal docking ports of the prior games, instead featuring external docking clamps. Ship sizes have been redesigned according to a logical scale. Egosoft ensured a pilot would actually fit in their cockpit, and that a carrier vessel was actually large enough to carry a given number of ships. As such, ships and stations are noticeably different in size from prior games.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{incursion}} {{into southern}} Italy in 217 BC, Hannibal defeated the Roman {{forces in the}} battle of Cannae (216 BC). This victory brought him <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> allies from Campania, Samnium, Apulia, Lucania, Bruttium and Magna Graecia, who revolted from Rome enticed by his promises of freedom. One of these allies was the city of Herdonia in northern Apulia. It was the site of a general engagement between Hannibal and the Romans already in 212 BC (see the first battle of Herdonia), because despite the severe defeats on the battlefield Rome still managed to preserve intact the core of its system of alliances in Italy and continued to mount a slow but steady counter-offensive.|$|E

[...] In late 1963 and early 1964 British Invasion influence started permeating the music scenes there. [...] In June 1964 the Beatles visited Australia as part of their world tour and were greeted by a crowd of an estimated 300,000 in Adelaide. [...] In response, many prior Australian surf bands adapted by adding vocals over guitars, and <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> bands formed. [...] The first wave of British-inspired bands tended towards the pop-oriented sound of the Merseybeat. [...] With rise in popularity of bands such as the Rolling Stones and the Animals, a second wave of Australian bands emerged that favored a harder, blues-influenced approach.|$|E

[...] In addition, she praised the episode's adaptation of the source novels for including a large number of important scenes and storylines with minimal filler. [...] " [...] this was a leanly written episode, which tackled {{a huge amount of}} exposition and scene-setting but never wasted a word." [...] Nina Shen Rastogi, writing for Vulture, thought that the episode served as both a redefinition of the plot and an reintroduction of the first seasons's themes of violence and succession. She wrote, [...] "from the very first scene of last night's season premiere, GoT strove to reassure us that some things would never change." [...] Simon Abrams of Slant Magazine lauded [...] "The North Remembers" [...] as a [...] "thematically focused" [...] episode on the subject of good leadership. He enjoyed how each of the rulers were developed in the premiere and hoped {{that the rest of the}} season [...] "can keep up with its premiere's big ideas." ...|$|E
50|$|Both {{theological}} and secular universities were registered. This list quickly grew as new universities were founded throughout Europe.

While these papal bulls initially did little more than confer the privileges of a specified university such as Bologna or Paris, by the end of the 13th century universities sought a papal bull conferring on them ius ubique docendi, the privilege of granting to masters licences to teach in all universities without further examination (Haskins, 1941:282).|$|R

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} features in the Golden Sun series is the collection and manipulation of elemental creatures called Djinn (singular: Djinni), and The Lost Age introduces <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> Djinn. They can be found scattered in hiding throughout the game. There are eleven Djinn {{for each of the four}} elements (not counting the ones that can only be found in the original Golden Sun) that may be allocated to each character. [...] Djinn form the basis of the game’s statistics enhancement system, and the way they are allocated to different characters modifies the characters' classes, increasing maximum hit points, Psynergy points, and other statistics, and also alters the available Psynergy that the characters can perform. Djinni may also be used to directly attack an opponent, and once used, Djinn no longer contribute to a character’s class but can be used to summon a powerful elemental spirit to attack an opponent. This is the game’s most powerful method of attack, and also the riskiest, as it requires Djinn to be on standby and therefore not available to bolster the statistics of whichever character the Djinni is equipped to. [...] Once a Djinni on Standby has been used for a Summon Sequence, it takes a number of turns recovering before it restores itself to Set position on a character, but a subsequent increase in the affinity of the element of the attack is bolstered on the character for the duration of the battle.|$|E
