40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} classifying all positive-definite integer-valued quadratic forms that represent all positive odd integers. Kaplansky considered this problem for ternary forms, giving a list of 23 candidates, and proving that 19 of those represent <b>all</b> positive <b>odds.</b> (Jagy later dealt with a 20 th candidate.) Assuming that the remaining three forms represent <b>all</b> positive <b>odds,</b> we prove that an arbitrary, positive-definite quadratic form represents <b>all</b> positive <b>odds</b> {{if and only if}} it represents the odd numbers from 1 up to 451. This result is analogous to Bhargava and Hanke’s celebrated 290 -theorem. In addition, we prove that these three remaining ternaries represent all positive odd integers, assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. This result is made possible by a new analytic method for bounding the cusp constants of integer-valued quaternary quadratic forms Q with fundamental discriminant. This method is based on the analytic properties of Rankin-Selberg L-functions, and we use it to prove that if Q is a quaternary form with fundamental discriminant, the largest locally represented integer n for which Q(~x) = n has no integer solutions is O(D 2 +). 1...|$|R
