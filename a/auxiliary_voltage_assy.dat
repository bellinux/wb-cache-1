40|$|AbstractThe {{theory of}} the {{computer}} calculation of the stability of ion motion in periodic quadrupole fields is considered. A matrix approach for the numerical solution of the Hill equation and examples of calculations of stability diagrams are described. The advantage of this method {{is that it can}} be used for any periodic waveform. The stability diagrams with periodic rectangular waveform voltages are calculated with this approach. Calculations of the conventional stability diagram of the 3 -D ion trap and the first six regions of stability of a mass filter with this method are presented. The stability of the ion motion for the case of a trapping voltage with two or more frequencies is also discussed. It is shown that quadrupole excitation with the rational angular frequency ω = NΩ/P (where N, P are integers and Ω is the angular frequency of the trapping field) leads to splitting of the stability diagram along iso-β lines. Each stable region of the unperturbed diagram splits into P stable bands. The widths of the unstable resonance lines depend on the amplitude of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>voltage</b> and the frequency. With a low auxiliary frequency splitting of the stability diagram is greater near the boundaries of the unperturbed diagram.

40|$|Conventional thyristor-based load commutated {{inverter}} (LCI) -fed {{wound field}} synchronous machine operates only above a minimum speed {{that is necessary}} to develop enough back emf to ensure commutation. The drive is started and brought up to a speed of around 10 - 15 % by a complex `dc link current pulsing' technique. During this process, the drive have problems such as pulsating torque, insufficient average starting torque, longer starting time, etc. In this regard a simple starting and low-speed operation scheme, by employing an <b>auxiliary</b> low-power <b>voltage</b> source inverter (VSI) between the LCI and the machine terminals, is presented in this study. The drive is started and brought up to a low speed of around 15 % using the VSI alone with field oriented control. The complete control is then smoothly and dynamically transferred to the conventional LCI control. After the control transfer, the VSI is turned off and physically disconnected from the main circuit. The advantages of this scheme are smooth starting, complete control of torque and flux at starting and low speeds, less starting time, stable operation, etc. The voltage rating of the required VSI is very low of the order of 10 - 15 %, whereas the current rating is dependent on the starting torque requirement of the load. The experimental results from a 15. 8 hp LCI-fed wound field synchronous machine are given to demonstrate the scheme...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the complete theoretical analysis, simulation and design optimisation of a Full-Bridge ZeroVoltage -Switched Phase-Shift (FB-ZVS-PS) DC-DC converter with an LCC auxiliary circuit, {{working with a}} frequency of 250 kHz and with an output power of 1 kW. The converter uses a voltage capacitor divider to create half of the input voltage in one terminal of the <b>auxiliary</b> inductor. The <b>voltage</b> at the inductor terminals will, therefore, oscillate between [...] V I / 2 and +V I / 2, producing an additional current reinforcing the primary current during the passive-to-active transition and increasing the energy available to achieve ZVS. This way, {{it is possible to}} design FB-PS-ZVS DC/DC converter without using a commutating inductor in series with the power transformer, avoiding the problems related with the effective duty cycle reduction. Furthermore, it is shown that, by properly design of LCC circuit, the ZVS range and the effective-duty-cycle can be optimised, without significant overall penalties. I...|$|R
