5|$|A few early sets {{experimented with}} {{alternate}} art for cards. However, Wizards {{came to believe}} that this impeded easy recognition of <b>a</b> <b>card</b> and that having multiple versions caused confusion when identifying <b>a</b> <b>card</b> at a glance. Consequently, alternate art is now only used sparingly and mostly for promotional cards. When older cards are reprinted in new sets, however, Wizards of the Coast has guaranteed that they will be printed with new art to make the older cards more collectible.|$|E
5|$|Now, {{the next}} player {{to the right}} plays <b>a</b> <b>card</b> {{following}} the same rules as the second player: if possible, <b>a</b> <b>card</b> of the same suit as the first player's card must be played, higher than the first two cards if possible; or {{if this is not}} possible, then lower; if no card of the same suit is held, then if possible, a trump card must be played; if no trump card is held, then any card may be played. The fourth player likewise plays <b>a</b> <b>card</b> following these same rules.|$|E
5|$|Each set since Kaldesh {{features}} two Planeswalker decks. They {{contain a}} 60-card pre-constructed deck with an exclusive Planeswalker, {{as well as}} several exclusive cards, two booster packs from the set they accompany, as well as a rule guide and <b>a</b> <b>card</b> board box with an image of the included Planeswalker.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> credit <b>card</b> is {{different}} from <b>a</b> charge <b>card,</b> where it requires the balance to be repaid in full each month. In contrast, credit cards allow the consumers a continuing balance of debt, subject to interest being charged. <b>A</b> credit <b>card</b> also differs from <b>a</b> cash <b>card,</b> {{which can be used}} like currency by the owner of the <b>card.</b> <b>A</b> credit <b>card</b> differs from <b>a</b> charge <b>card</b> also in that <b>a</b> credit <b>card</b> typically involves <b>a</b> third-party entity that pays the seller and is reimbursed by the buyer, whereas <b>a</b> charge <b>card</b> simply defers payment by the buyer until a later date.|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> debit <b>card</b> (also {{known as}} <b>a</b> bank <b>card</b> or check <b>card)</b> is <b>a</b> plastic payment <b>card</b> {{that can be}} used instead of cash when making purchases. It is similar to <b>a</b> credit <b>card,</b> but unlike <b>a</b> credit <b>card,</b> the money comes {{directly}} from the user's bank account when performing a transaction.|$|R
5|$|On June 16, 1987, Jacobson {{received}} <b>a</b> <b>card</b> in {{his mail}} {{telling him to}} go to the post office and pick up the envelope that supposedly contained Boys Who Love Boys. Comfort observed him doing so and got a search warrant for his home on that basis. He was arrested shortly thereafter, 26 months after the postal inspectors had first contacted him.|$|E
5|$|On March 4, 2006, Cotto {{defended his}} WBO Junior Welterweight title by {{knocking}} out Gianluca Branco, {{who had to}} give up during the eighth round of their bout due to a shoulder injury. Cotto dominated the fight as a result of jab combinations in <b>a</b> <b>card</b> that took place in Bayamón, Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|On March 9, 1877, gamblers Jim Levy and Charlie Harrison {{argued over}} {{a game of}} cards in a saloon in Cheyenne, Wyoming.

50|$|Water polo: <b>A</b> red <b>card</b> {{is issued}} to a coach or {{player on the}} bench for a second {{incident}} of misconduct after receiving <b>a</b> yellow <b>card.</b> <b>A</b> person receiving <b>a</b> red <b>card</b> must leave the competition area.|$|R
50|$|If two {{cards are}} drawn with {{replacement}} from <b>a</b> deck of <b>cards,</b> {{the event of}} drawing <b>a</b> red <b>card</b> on the first trial and that of drawing <b>a</b> red <b>card</b> on the second trial are independent. By contrast, if two cards are drawn without replacement from <b>a</b> deck of <b>cards,</b> the event of drawing <b>a</b> red <b>card</b> on the first trial and that of drawing <b>a</b> red <b>card</b> on the second trial are not independent, because a deck that has had <b>a</b> red <b>card</b> removed has proportionately fewer red cards.|$|R

5|$|One person plays <b>a</b> <b>card,</b> and {{the player}} {{to the right}} of this person, from the {{opponent}} team, plays <b>a</b> <b>card.</b> As with Two-player Tute, if the second player has one or more higher cards of the same suit as the first player's card, one of these must be played. If the second player has cards of the same suit, but only ones of less value than the first card, one of these must be played. If the second player does not have any cards of the same suit but has one or more trump cards, one of these must be played. If the second player has no cards of the same suit and no trumps, any other card can be played.|$|E
5|$|Players can gamble. They {{can do this}} {{by visiting}} casinos, buying chips with the three major {{currencies}} in the games, and playing either blackjack, slots, or roulette within them. Players can also play <b>a</b> <b>card</b> game called Caravan, which was specifically designed for the game and has its own rules, and can be played with certain people outside of the casinos.|$|E
5|$|A gallery feature {{was also}} planned and would allow players to unlock bonus {{material}} {{depending on their}} progression in the game. Fan artwork and music would be unlockable through this feature, as well as minigames, including <b>a</b> <b>card</b> game similar to Triple Triad from Final Fantasy VIII. The remake {{was expected to be}} released on the Internet for free and played on console emulators, since there would be no cartridge version due to financial constraints. Only a semi-working 3D test was actually completed, and the project was discontinued in mid-2000 due to a number of factors, including the accidental loss of Lazur's data and his desire to improve his programming skills.|$|E
50|$|Badminton: <b>A</b> red <b>card</b> {{is given}} to a singles player or doubles pair to penalize {{subsequent}} infractions after receiving <b>a</b> yellow <b>card.</b> It counts as fault, meaning the opposing side is awarded a point. After <b>a</b> second red <b>card,</b> <b>a</b> player or pair may be disqualified with <b>a</b> black <b>card</b> at the tournament referee's discretion.|$|R
50|$|The Sake Cup {{is unique}} in that, though {{technically}} classified as <b>a</b> 10-point <b>card,</b> it counts as both <b>a</b> 10-point <b>card</b> and <b>a</b> 1-point <b>card</b> at the same time. Some rules allow the Sake Cup to count as <b>a</b> 10-point <b>card</b> and two 1-point cards at the same time.|$|R

5|$|After {{purchasing}} or adding {{value to}} a multi-ride card, the card balance is valid for 45 days counted {{from the day}} of first use. The ticket is good for 8 rides. The multi-ride card provides a discount of about 21% off the full fare of a reserved Standard Seat. Non-registered and registered multi-ride tickets {{can be purchased at}} the ticket windows of all THSRC stations. Upon first purchase of a multi-ride ticket, <b>a</b> <b>card</b> deposit fee of NT$100 is required (refundable if the card is returned).

When the protagonist decides to spare Ryoji Mochizuki, the Social Link of the Fool Arcana changes into the Judgement Arcana, which symbolizes {{the end of his}} journey and looking back at what has transpired this far. The final Social Link the protagonist attains is the Universe Arcana, <b>a</b> <b>card</b> from the Thoth tarot that replaces World Arcana, symbolizing the full awareness of the protagonist's place in the world.|$|E

5|$|As the Mk. XIV could {{calculate}} {{the effects of}} a shallow climb or dive (or glide as it is referred to in bombing), the computor included its own levelling mechanism. This was added to the range angle calculated by the computor to move the sight head. Levelling the system required adjustment of both the computor and the sight head. Since these were in a fixed relationship to each other, levelling could be carried out on the ground and then left alone. Any adjustments required were recorded on <b>a</b> <b>card</b> fixed {{to the front of the}} computor.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the entire map is obscured until explored by the player. The map consists of a landlocked sea with several islands, wreckage, sea creatures, enemy ships, ports, and whirlpools. The player can sometimes encounter message bottles that clear away fog of war on the map to reveal hidden ports.Sea creatures and enemy ships appear randomly and challenge the player for gold or commodities in <b>a</b> <b>card</b> minigame. Ports are trading and safe zones where the player can sell commodities, buy upgrades for the ship, and take on sidequests. Whirlpools teleport the player's ship to a random location on the map.|$|E
5|$|Bound for a London {{show from}} Liverpool, The Beatles escape {{a horde of}} fans ("A Hard Day's Night"). Once they are aboard the train and trying to relax, various interruptions test their patience: after a dalliance with a female passenger, Paul's {{grandfather}} is confined to the guard's van and the four lads join him there to keep him company. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr play <b>a</b> <b>card</b> game, entertaining some schoolgirls before arriving at their desired destination ("I Should Have Known Better").|$|E

5|$|In 2006, The Royal Bank of Scotland Group {{undertook}} {{the first}} trial of PayPass contactless debit and credit cards in Europe.

A single booster pack can contain enough for a basic game (two ships, <b>a</b> crew <b>card,</b> <b>a</b> resource <b>card,</b> <b>an</b> asteroid <b>card,</b> <b>a</b> die, and a rules booklet), but maximum customizability requires access to a wider collection.|$|R
