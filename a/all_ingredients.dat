5|$|The soup {{has even}} {{played a role}} in the Soviet space program. In March 1961, as part of a {{communications}} equipment test, a pre-recorded recipe for borscht was broadcast from the Korabl-Sputnik 4 spacecraft. The craft, carrying animals and a mannequin, had been launched into low Earth orbit in preparation for manned space flights. Actual borscht eventually made its way into outer space as space food for Soviet and, later, Russian cosmonauts. Originally, a puréed version of borscht was supplied in tubes. <b>All</b> <b>ingredients</b> for the space borscht (which include beef, beetroots, cabbage, potatoes, carrots, onions, parsley root and tomato paste) were cooked separately, then combined one by one in strictly controlled order, sterilized, packed into tubes, sealed airtight and autoclaved. In the 1970s, the tubes were replaced with packages of rehydratable freeze-dried borscht with regular-size bits of cooked vegetables.|$|E

For example, the urad dal is imported from Myanmar, asafetida is imported from Afghanistan, and black pepper comes from Kerala. The committee often makes surprise visits to various branches to assure that production conditions are hygienic. When a new branch of Lijjat opens, a neighbouring Lijjat branch helps it by guiding and training new members.|$|E

500|$|During their 2001 study, the Petitcodiac Watershed Alliance {{noted the}} effects of {{agriculture}} on the river's water quality, and recommended to work with local farmers to install cattle fencing around streams which run through their properties, and [...] "eventually phase out" [...] cosmetic pesticide usage. The Petitcodiac Riverkeeper holds a stronger position on the issue: the organisation notes that pesticides [...] "find {{their way into the}} surface and ground water by leaching into the soil or as part of stormwater runoff." [...] They request that, while measures have been taken in 2009 by the provincial government to regulate cosmetic pesticide usage, the province must forbid its usage altogether and require chemical manufacturers to disclose health warnings and <b>all</b> <b>ingredients</b> on labels.

500|$|Following 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kubrick {{originally}} planned {{to make a}} film about the life of the French emperor Napoleon. Fascinated by his life and own [...] "self-destruction", Kubrick {{spent a great deal of}} time planning the film's development, and had conducted about two years of extensive research into Napoleon's life, reading several hundred books and gaining access to Napoleon's personal memoirs and commentaries. He also tried to see every film ever made about Napoleon and found none of them appealing, including Abel Gance's 1927 film which is generally considered to be a masterpiece, but for Kubrick, a [...] "really terrible" [...] movie. Lo Brutto states that Napoleon was an ideal subject for Kubrick, embracing the director's [...] "passion for control, power, obsession, strategy, and the military", while Napoleon's psychological intensity and depth, logistical genius and war, sex, and the evil nature of man were <b>all</b> <b>ingredients</b> which deeply appealed to Kubrick.|$|E

2500|$|Paintballs (pellets): Paintballs, the {{ammunition}} {{used in the}} marker, are spherical gelatin capsules containing primarily polyethylene glycol, other non-toxic and water-soluble substances, and dye. The quality of paintballs {{is dependent on the}} brittleness of the ball's shell, the roundness of the sphere, and the thickness of the fill; higher-quality balls are almost perfectly spherical, with a very thin shell to guarantee breaking upon impact, and a thick, brightly colored fill that is difficult to hide or wipe off during the game. The highest-grade paintballs incorporate cornstarch and metallic flake into the fill to leave a thick glittery [...] "splat" [...] that is very obvious against any background color, and hard to wipe off. Almost all paintballs in use today are biodegradeable. <b>All</b> <b>ingredients</b> used in the making of a paintball are food-grade quality and are harmless to the participants and environment.

2500|$|Primarily, the Miller Highway {{consisted}} of six lanes, supported above the street level on steel columns, which were located {{at regular intervals}} (~80 feet) at the outer edges and center of the roadway. [...] Longitudinal strength girders ran between the support columns along {{the direction of the}} roadway. [...] The longitudinal girders supported the industrial looking balustrades and the median. [...] Lateral strength girders ran between the support columns across the roadway, and was the location of the expansion joints. [...] Smaller longitudinal and transverse floorbeams formed a lattice structure between major girders to support the road deck. [...] The road deck {{consisted of}} reinforced concrete, on top of which the paved surface would sit. [...] Originally this was Belgian block, and was eventually substituted or paved over with asphalt as construction materials matured. [...] Drainage was provided at the expansion joints (on the older sections) or grated channels {{along the edge of the}} road (newest sections), with rainwater and snowmelt being plumbed to the street through scuppers and downspouts located at the main support columns. [...] It was not uncommon during the life of the highway that it would be supporting not only traffic, but 6 to 8 inches of standing water. [...] The high impermeable balustrades, the undersized scuppers, and the lack of drain cleaning / maintenance were <b>all</b> <b>ingredients</b> which contributed to the structure's demise.|$|E

He is doubtless clever enough to paint rawness when he must, but he has an irrepressible sense of ripeness. Half the ripeness of England--half the religion, one might almost say--is in its gardens; they are truly pious foundations. It is doubtless {{because there are so}} many of them that the country seems so finished, and the sort of care they demand is an intenser deliberation, which passes into the national temper. One must have lived in other lands to observe fully how large a proportion of this one is walled in for growing flowers. The English love of flowers is inveterate; it is the most, unanimous protest against the grayness of some of the conditions, and it should receive justice from those who accuse the race of taking its pleasure too sadly. A good garden is an organized revel, and there is no country in which there are so many.|$|E
