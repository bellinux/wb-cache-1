5|$|The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour is {{a comedy}} show {{featuring}} various songs and sketches in {{a parody of}} The Brady Bunch Hour and Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In. It features Homer, Marge, Bart, and Maggie. Lisa refuses to participate, but is replaced by an attractive blonde bombshell (voiced by Pamela Hayden). After the introduction there is a sketch, where the family are portrayed as beavers living in a dam with Tim Conway as <b>a</b> <b>skunk</b> and Homer's boss. The show ends with a medley of songs sung by the family, Jasper Beardley and Waylon Smithers.|$|E
25|$|Some {{accounts}} {{describe the}} Fouke Monster as running swiftly with a galloping gait and swinging its {{arms in a}} fashion similar to a monkey. Reports also describe it as having a terrible odor, the odor being described as a combination of <b>a</b> <b>skunk</b> and a wet dog, and as having bright red eyes {{about the size of}} silver dollars.|$|E

50|$|<b>Skunk</b> oil is <b>an</b> {{oil that}} is {{obtained}} from the two lateral glands that run the length of <b>a</b> <b>skunk's</b> back. Skunks store fat in these glands for use during hibernation or semi-hibernation in warmer climates. Skunk oil has minimal odor.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>skunked</b> term is <b>a</b> {{word that}} becomes {{difficult}} to use because it is transitioning from one meaning to another, perhaps inconsistent or even opposite, usage.

25|$|Pepé Le Pew storylines {{typically}} involve Pepé {{in pursuit}} of a female black cat, whom Pepé mistakes for <b>a</b> <b>skunk</b> ("la belle femme skunk fatale"). The cat, who was retroactively named Penelope Pussycat, often has a white stripe painted down her back, usually by accident (such as by squeezing under a fence with wet white paint). Penelope frantically races to get away from him because of his putrid odour, his overly aggressive manner or both, while Pepé hops after her at a leisurely pace.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the more}} {{successful}} films was Melody Time, the animated 1948 film from Walt Disney Studios featuring Dennis Day. The Legend of Johnny Appleseed, a 19-minute segment, {{tells the story of}} an apple farmer who sees others going west, wistfully wishing he was not tied down by his orchard, until an angel appears, singing an apple song, setting Johnny on a mission. When he treats <b>a</b> <b>skunk</b> kindly, all animals everywhere thereafter trust him. The cartoon featured lively tunes, and a childlike simplicity of message. This animated short was included in Disney's American Legends, a compilation of four animated shorts.|$|E

The red skunk berry bandolier was added as a memorial tribute to a battle fought with Cheyenne warriors.

50|$|Mephits {{are roughly}} {{humanoid}} in appearance and somewhat small (approximately 4 feet in height). Their disposition {{depends on their}} plane of origin, though they are rarely endearing. Each type of mephit has some form of breath weapon, which can usually do minor elemental damage, though it is mostly intended (much as <b>a</b> <b>skunk's</b> spray) to ward off would-be attackers.|$|R
500|$|Her {{trademark}} {{moves through}} the series include double-sai throws that can be also performed midair, teleport kicks, and on-ground rolling attacks. Mileena also utilizes her sai in most of her Fatalities, including immobilizing her opponents prior to the killing sequence (such as her [...] "Rip Off" [...] finisher in MK2011), while she pretends to kiss her victims in others. In Mortal Kombat X, both of her Fatalities exhibit her cannibalistic traits. There was a popular but completely false urban legend-style rumor regarding a supposed [...] "Nudality" [...] finishing move in Mortal Kombat II. Mileena's Animality in UMK3 and Trilogy sees her transform into <b>a</b> <b>skunk</b> that sprays her opponent.|$|E
500|$|From its {{creation}} until the mid-20th century, The Country Wife {{was subject to}} both aesthetic praise and moral outrage. Many critics through the centuries have acknowledged its linguistic energy and wit, including even Victorians such as Leigh Hunt, who praised its literary quality in a selection of Restoration plays that he published in 1840 (itself a daring undertaking, for reputedly [...] "obscene" [...] plays that had been long out of print). However, in an influential review of Hunt's edition, Thomas Babington Macaulay swept aside questions of literary merit, claiming with indignation that [...] "Wycherley's indecency is protected against the critics as <b>a</b> <b>skunk</b> is protected against the hunters. It is safe, because it is too filthy to handle and too noisome even to approach." [...] Margery Pinchwife, regarded in Wycherley's own time as a purely comic character, was denounced by Macaulay as a scarlet woman who threw herself into [...] "a licentious intrigue of the lowest and least sentimental kind".|$|E
500|$|The Browns {{reached the}} NFL {{championship}} game in 1951 and 1952, but lost both times. Speedie led the NFL in receiving in 1951 {{and was named}} a first-team All Pro, {{but he did not}} play in the championship game due to an injury. He was selected for the Pro Bowl for a second time in 1952. After that season, however, he left the Browns to join the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Western Interprovincial Football Union under acrimonious circumstances. Speedie had an independent streak that did not sit well with Brown, whose domineering coaching style grated against many of the men who played for him. [...] "He was one of the ones that Paul Brown picked on quite a bit", recalled former teammate Ken Carpenter. [...] "He'd get on Speedie's case for no particular reason." [...] Speedie showed his displeasure by bringing <b>a</b> <b>skunk</b> to training camp in 1952 and calling it [...] "Paul". Brown told Speedie he did not think it was very funny, to which Speedie responded that it was a nocturnal animal and was named after Paul Revere.|$|E

2500|$|Sometimes {{this formula}} is varied. In his initial cartoon, Odor-able Kitty, Pepé (going {{by the name}} Henry in this short) unwittingly pursues a male cat who has {{deliberately}} disguised himself as <b>a</b> <b>skunk</b> (complete {{with the scent of}} Limburger cheese) in order to scare off a bunch of characters who have mistreated him. Scent-imental Over You has Pepé pursuing a female dog who has donned <b>a</b> <b>skunk</b> pelt (mistaking it for a fur coat). In the end, she removes her pelt, revealing that she's a dog. Pepé then [...] "reveals" [...] himself as another dog and the two embrace. However, he then reveals to the audience that he's still <b>a</b> <b>skunk.</b> In Wild Over You, Pepé attempts to seduce a wild cat that has escaped a zoo (during what is called [...] "Le grande tour du Zoo" [...] at a 1900 exhibition), and painted herself to look like <b>a</b> <b>skunk</b> to escape her keepers. This cartoon is notable for not only diverging from the Pepé/female-black-cat dynamic, but also rather cheekily showing that Pepé likes to be beaten up, considering the wild cat thrashes him numerous times. Really Scent is also a subversion with Penelope (here called [...] "Fabrette") attracted to him from the beginning, removing the need for Pepé to chase her as she goes to him. But Pepé's scent still causes a problem for her as they try to build a relationship.|$|E
2500|$|Isatai'i {{tried to}} absolve {{himself of the}} blame for the {{disastrous}} defeat by claiming that his magic had been weakened before the battle when one of the Cheyennes violated a sacred taboo by killing <b>a</b> <b>skunk.</b> The Cheyennes took this poorly, especially the Dog Soldiers, and responded by beating him severely. [...] Isatai'i was discredited and publicly humiliated.|$|E
2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>skunk</b> often {{identified}} as Pepé {{appears in the}} Art Davis-directed cartoon Odor of the Day (1948); in this entry, the theme of romantic pursuit is missing as the skunk (in a non-speaking role, save for a shared [...] "Gesundheit!" [...] at the finish) vies with a male dog for lodging accommodations on a cold winter day. This should be noted {{as one of the}} two cartoons where the character, if this is indeed Pepé, uses his scent-spray as a deliberate weapon: shot from his tail {{as if it were a}} machine gun. The other one is Touché and Go, where he frees himself from the jaws of a shark by releasing his odor into the shark's mouth.|$|E

2500|$|In The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries, in the episode, [...] "Platinum Wheel of Fortune", when Sylvester gets a white stripe on his back, <b>a</b> <b>skunk</b> {{immediately}} {{falls in}} love with him. This is not Pepé, but a similar character identified as [...] "Pitu Le Pew" [...] (voiced by Jeff Bennett). However, he does say, [...] "What can I say, Pepé Le Pew is my third cousin. It runs in the family". Pepé would later appear in the episode [...] "Is Paris Stinking" [...] (once again voiced by Greg Burson), where he pursues Sylvester who is unintentionally dressed in drag. [...] Pepé would appear once more in Tweety's High-Flying Adventure, falling in love with both Sylvester and Penelope (Sylvester had gotten a white stripe on his back from Penelope as they fought over Tweety), actually showing a preference for Sylvester.|$|E
2500|$|Emma Leroy (Janet Wright) is Brent's mother, {{the brains}} and muscle of the family. She and Oscar squabble {{constantly}} and she usually ends {{up having to}} deal with the fallout from his actions, which she usually makes worse. Though he embarrasses and annoys her, she does truly love him. She has also found [...] "letting go" [...] of Brent difficult and reacts badly when someone else appears to replace her in some aspect of his life. Her main hobbies are knitting, crocheting, and gardening and she is active in many of the town's committees. She has also been shown to possess great strength (being able to hurl a cinder block at <b>a</b> <b>skunk</b> across the yard with little effort), and other characters often seek her advice. She has a quick-tempered, cunning, domineering personality. After the end of the series she remained married to Oscar, despite doctor's orders.|$|E
2500|$|And yet again, in Really Scent, Pepé {{removes his}} odor by locking {{himself in a}} {{deodorant}} plant so Penelope (Or known as [...] "Fabrette", in this instance a black cat with an unfortunate birthmark) would like him (this is also the only episode that Pepé is acutely aware of his own odor, having checked the word Pew in the dictionary). However, Penelope (who in this picture is actually {{trying to have a}} relationship with Pepé because all the male cats of New Orleans take her to be <b>a</b> <b>skunk</b> and run like blazes, but is appalled by his odor) had decided to make her own odor match her appearance and had locked herself in a Limburger cheese factory. Now more forceful and demanding, Penelope quickly corners the terrified Pepé, who, after smelling her new stench, wants nothing more than to escape the amorous female cat. Unfortunately, she will not take [...] "no" [...] for an answer and proceeds to chase Pepé off into the distance, with no intention of letting him escape. (Credited to Abe Levitow, this cartoon is the only short in the Pepé Le Pew series not directed by Chuck Jones, save the debatable Odor of the Day—see below).|$|E

5000|$|Rapid fading (transitory nature): Signal lasts a short time. This {{is true of}} {{all systems}} {{involving}} sound. It {{does not take into}} account audio recording technology and is also not true for written language. It tends not to apply to animal signals involving chemicals and smells which often fade slowly. For example, <b>a</b> <b>skunk's</b> smell, produced in its glands, lingers to deter a predator from attacking.|$|R
5000|$|Lightstruck, or [...] "skunked" [...] or [...] "skunky", beer {{has been}} exposed to {{ultraviolet}} and visible light.

A molecule resulting from a subsequent chain of reactions, 3-methylbut-2-ene-1-thiol, is very similar chemically and in odour to the musk-borne mercaptans that are <b>a</b> <b>skunk's</b> natural defences.|$|R
2500|$|Block brought {{humor to}} What's My Line?. On one show, upon a {{contestant}} being {{revealed to be}} <b>a</b> <b>skunk</b> breeder, Block was surprised they hadn’t been able to guess his occupation because, [...] "After all, the fellow had a certain air about him." [...] Block {{was able to bring}} levity to what may otherwise have been serious, dry topics, such as with the appearance of Estes Kefauver, a U.S. Senator who was leading an investigation into organized crime. Much of the investigation was televised and Block suggested to Kefauver he change the name of his broadcast to [...] "What's My Crime?". Block also created what became a tradition of the show's opening. At the beginning of the show each panelist would introduce the panelist sitting beside them, except for the last who would introduce Host John Daly. It was Block's idea, as the last panelist, to break from the simple, straightforward introduction and instead introduce Daly with a joke. This was later taken up by Bennett Cerf after Block's departure. It also fell to Block as the comedian, then later Steve Allen and Fred Allen, to participate in what Gil Fates called his [...] "Gambits". Prior to the broadcast, Fates would hint to Block a line of questioning for one of the guests which he felt would generate the most laughs. Fates has said it required a comedian to sense from his clues what would generate laughter. For example, with a guest who manufactured girdles, Block was advised to ask questions about kitchen items. On the show Block asked, [...] "Will it make ice-cubes?" [...] To a professional sword swallower he asked, [...] "Do you work outdoors–or is yours considered an inside job?." [...] While technically not cheating, as the panelist was not told the guest's profession, the practice was eventually discontinued in light of the quiz show scandals.|$|E
