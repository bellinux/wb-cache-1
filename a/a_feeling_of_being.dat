5|$|A cold usually {{begins with}} fatigue, <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> chilled, sneezing, and a headache, {{followed}} {{in a couple}} of days by a runny nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last for up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.|$|E

500|$|In {{an overall}} {{negative}} review for Rudebox, Ed Power from Hot Press magazine wrote {{that it was}} not until as the [...] "album lurches towards its midpoint does some calm descend. 'She's Madonna', coasting on a glossy Pet Shop Boys production job, is a misty eyed ballad in the tradition of Williams' finest—i.e. slushiest—work". The song received further negative feedback from David Hutchison of Attitude magazine, during a retrospective review for the album. He theorized that Williams' random choice of cover version of songs gave it <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> an old mixtape. This was vividly noticeable in the [...] "outrageous break-up fantasy played out over icy synths and euphoric hand-claps" [...] of [...] "She's Madonna".|$|E
500|$|Whitehead {{describes}} causal efficacy as [...] "the experience {{dominating the}} primitive living organisms, {{which have a}} sense for the fate from which they have emerged, and the fate towards which they go." [...] It is, in other words, the sense of causal relations between entities, <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> influenced and affected by the surrounding environment, unmediated by the senses. [...] Presentational immediacy, on the other hand, is what is usually referred to as [...] "pure sense perception", unmediated by any causal or symbolic interpretation, even unconscious interpretation. [...] In other words, it is pure appearance, {{which may or may}} not be delusive (e.g. mistaking an image in a mirror for [...] "the real thing").|$|E

This 12-foot-tall piece {{in the middle of a}} large, open plaza is often thought to represent a mushroom cloud topped by a massive human skull, but Moore's interpretation was very different. He once told a friend that he hoped viewers would [...] "go around it, looking out through the open spaces, and that they may have <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> in a cathedral."

500|$|Koji Dejima of Bounce {{felt that}} the album was ingenious {{in the way that}} it created <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> out of place due to the its arrangements, melodies and lyrics. He praised the album's varied sound, {{and the fact that the}} band always [...] "spoke with their own words" [...] despite this variety of sound. He noted [...] "Aruku Around"'s strong dance music sound, and likened [...] "Klee" [...] to the songs of The Police, and [...] "Omotesandō Nijūroku-ji" [...] to the music of the 1970s American band Television. Rolling Stone Japan gave the album four stars out of five, praising the Yamaguchi's [...] "literary and original" [...] lyrics, and how human the music sounded despite its {{electronic}} sound. Kaori Komatsu of Rockin' On Japan felt that Yamaguchi's lyrics created an [...] "interesting feeling of unease" [...] and had a [...] "deep flavor". She noted that Yamaguchi's lyrics often described everyday life and his mental space, layered on top of each other in impressionist scenes. She {{felt that the}} band's sound had become more ambitious in their genre crossovers, especially the inclusions of ambient music and dub elements, and that the songs had a [...] "sense of city", much stronger since they had moved to Tokyo. Tanaka of CDJournal noted similar qualities in the songs [...] "Yes No" [...] and [...] "Ashita kara", which to him expressed the loneliness of city life.|$|E

2500|$|Montini {{had just}} one foreign posting in the {{diplomatic}} service of the Holy See as Secretary in office of the papal nuncio to Poland in 1923. Of the nationalism he experienced there he wrote: [...] "This form of nationalism treats foreigners as enemies, especially foreigners with whom one has common frontiers. Then one seeks the expansion of one's own country {{at the expense of}} the immediate neighbours. People grow up with <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> hemmed in.

2500|$|The {{cardinal}} {{symptom of}} decreased {{blood flow to}} the heart is chest pain, experienced as tightness around the chest and radiating to the left arm and the left angle of the jaw. This may be associated with diaphoresis (sweating), nausea and vomiting, as well as shortness of breath. In many cases, the sensation is [...] "atypical", with pain experienced in different ways or even being completely absent (which is more likely in female patients and those with diabetes). Some may report palpitations, anxiety or a sense of impending doom (angor animi) and <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> acutely ill. The description of the chest discomfort as a pressure has little utility in aiding a diagnosis as it is not specific for ACS.|$|E

Roddenberry [...] "virtually rewrote" [...] the first 15 episodes because of his [...] "dogmatic" [...] intention to depict human interaction [...] "without drawing on the baser motives of greed, lust, and power". Writers found the show's [...] "bible" [...] constricting and ridiculous and couldn't deal with Roddenberry's ego and treatment of them. It stated, for example, that [...] "regular characters all share <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> part of a band of brothers and sisters.

2500|$|MacCorkindale's film debut came in 1974 with Juggernaut. He {{was cast}} as Simon Doyle in the 1978 film {{adaptation}} of Agatha Christie's Death on the Nile {{at the age}} of 25. He became a friend of co-star Bette Davis, reflecting, [...] "There was <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> in awe of these people but I had a certain amount of pioneer courage, so I didn't let it get to me. But there were days when I thought, 'I'm about to do a scene with this cinema legend, am I up to it?' But people were very gracious. I was never the whipping boy because I was less experienced." [...] The role boosted MacCorkindale public profile and he considered it to be his career break. He won the London Evening Standard Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer for this part. MacCorkindale went on to star as sailor and spy Arthur Davies in The Riddle of the Sands (1979), the film adaptation of the celebrated Erskine Childers' novel.|$|E

2500|$|People {{experiencing}} the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon can often recall {{one or more}} features of the target word, such as the first letter, its syllabic stress, and words similar in sound and/or meaning. Individuals report <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> seized by the state, feeling something like mild anguish while searching for the word, {{and a sense of}} relief when the word is found. While many aspects of the tip-of-the-tongue state remain unclear, there are two major competing explanations for its occurrence, the direct-access view and the inferential view. The direct-access view posits that the state occurs when memory strength is not enough to recall an item, but is strong enough to trigger the state. The inferential view claims that TOTs aren't completely based on inaccessible, yet activated targets; rather they arise when the rememberer tries to piece together different clues about the word. Emotional-induced retrieval often causes more TOT experiences than an emotionally neutral retrieval, such as asking where a famous icon was assassinated rather than simply asking the capital city of a state. Emotional TOT experiences also have a longer retrieval time than non-emotional TOT experiences. [...] The cause of this [...] is unknown but possibilities include using a different retrieval strategy when having an emotional TOT experience rather than a non-emotional TOT experience, fluency at the time of retrieval, and strength of memory.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} sexual identity, {{adolescence}} is when most gay/lesbian and transgender adolescents begin {{to recognize and}} make sense of their feelings. Many adolescents may choose to come out during this period of their life once an identity has been formed; many others may go through a period of questioning or denial, which can include experimentation with both homosexual and heterosexual experiences. A study of 194 lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths under the age of 21 found that having an awareness of one's sexual orientation occurred, on average, around age 10, but the process of coming out to peers and adults occurred around age 16 and 17, respectively. [...] Coming to terms with and creating a positive LGBT identity can be difficult for some youth for a variety of reasons. Peer pressure is a large factor when youth who are questioning their sexuality or gender identity are surrounded by heteronormative peers and can cause great distress due to <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> different from everyone else. While coming out can also foster better psychological adjustment, the risks associated are real. Indeed, coming out {{in the midst of a}} heteronormative peer environment often comes with the risk of ostracism, hurtful jokes, and even violence. [...] Because of this, statistically the suicide rate amongst LGBT adolescents is up to four times higher than that of their heterosexual peers due to bullying and rejection from peers or family members.|$|E
2500|$|While {{many critics}} still {{consider}} the word [...] "beat" [...] in its literal sense of [...] "tired and beaten down," [...] others, including Kerouac himself promoted the generation more in sense of [...] "beatific" [...] or blissful. Holmes and Kerouac published several articles in popular magazines {{in an attempt}} to explain the movement. [...] In the November 16, 1952 New York Times Sunday Magazine, he wrote a piece exposing the faces of the Beat Generation. [...] "ne day [...] said, 'You know, this is a really beat generation' ... More than mere weariness, it implies the feeling of having been used, of being raw. [...] It involves a sort of nakedness of mind, and ultimately, of soul: [...] <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> reduced to the bedrock of consciousness. [...] In short, it means being undramatically pushed up against the wall of oneself." [...] He distinguishes Beats from the Lost Generation of the 1920s pointing out how the Beats are not lost but how they are searching for answers to all of life's questions. Kerouac's preoccupation with writers like Ernest Hemingway shaped his view of the beat generation. He uses a prose style which he adapted from Hemingway and throughout On the Road he alludes to novels like The Sun Also Rises. [...] "How to live seems much more crucial than why." [...] In many ways, it is a spiritual journey, a quest to find belief, belonging, and meaning in life. [...] Not content with the uniformity promoted by government and consumer culture, the Beats yearned for a deeper, more sensational experience. Holmes expands his attempt to define the generation in a 1958 article in Esquire magazine. This article was able to take more of a look back at the formation of the movement as it was published after On the Road. [...] "It describes the state of mind from which all unessentials have been stripped, leaving it receptive to everything around it, but impatient with trivial obstructions. [...] To be beat is to be at the bottom of your personality, looking up." ...|$|E
