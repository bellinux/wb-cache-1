40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the development of}} <b>anti-ageing</b> <b>cream.</b> Keratin protein derived from chicken feathers is used as an active ingredient in creams. Keratin was extracted by using reducing agent. Anti-ageing creams were produced by using several ingredients comprise of emulsifier, emollient, preservatives and surfactant. The creams were formulated using safe ingredients that include competitively price materials which are easily available in Malaysia. All the formulations were evaluated for acute skin irritancy involving animal study. Our observations on rabbit skin indicated that these formulations did not produce any skin irritation and enhance the skin structure. For stability study, all creams formulated had shown no changes in pH, colour and phase separation. Using keratin as an active ingredient in biomedical products will not only provide benefits to consumers – it will also encourage responsible waste management and sustainable commercial activities...|$|E

40|$|Joint {{research}} project with University of L'Aquila, Department of Life, Health, and Environmental Sciences. Flavonols {{have been identified}} {{in a wide range of}} fruits and vegetables, and a flavonol-rich diet has been linked with a relatively low occurrence of degenerative diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer’s disease, and various forms of cancer. This knowledge has resulted in the development of various food supplements and nutraceutical products, and given rise to a very profitable branch of industry. Notably quercetin preparations have become popular, mainly because of the wide availability and modest cost of this flavonol. Kaempferol has better pharmacokinetic properties, but is roughly 1000 times more expensive than the popular food supplement quercetin. Kaempferol and its glycosides are gaining increasing interest as for their antioxidant activity as a food supplement, in functional foods, beverages drinks, in pharmaceutical preparations and cosmetic formulations. Recently, it was demonstrated that kaempferol can be extracted in good quantities from the petals of the saffron crocus (Crocus sativa L.). Thus, rather than a waste product of the saffron spice production, the petals can be a readily exploitable good source of kaempferol for many applications, ranging from nutraceutical food supplements to cosmetic <b>anti-ageing</b> <b>creams...</b>|$|R
40|$|Resveratrol (RSV) is {{well known}} for its {{anti-oxidant}} and anti-aging properties. However, resveratrol is insoluble in water and has stability issues. Recently, efforts were placed to prepare a resveratrol-based advanced anti-aging topical product but it contains harsh organic solvents and oils that could be harmful to the human body and the environment. Hence, we propose the use of a multifunctional dendrimer to solve the solubility and stability issues of resveratrol. A dendrimer-resveratrol complex was prepared, optimized and tested for solubility enhancement, stability in solution and cream dosage forms. We have also developed a high performance liquid chromatography method to measure the resveratrol within the final product. PAMAM dendrimers increased the solubility and stability of resveratrol in water and semisolid dosage forms. Therefore, this product would be water based ‘green’ formulation devoid of harsh organic solvents and oils and can be safely applied to the skin. Additionally, we have shown that the dendrimer helped to increase overall RSV loading and skin penetration of resveratrol. The dendrimer-RSV formulation was successfully scaled up towards commercialization. Dendrimer with RSV has led to an innovation in <b>anti-aging</b> <b>cream</b> and solutions that could be commercially marketed.

40|$|Consumer {{demand for}} new {{products}} within the cosmetics and toiletries industry has encouraged the industry increasingly to incorporate and experiment with {{new products and}} processes, including nanotechnologies. A number of cosmetic products which claim to incorporate engineered nano-materials have already entered the market and include, for instance, <b>anti-ageing</b> <b>creams,</b> make up, hair care products, cleansers and moisturisers. While the use of engineered nano-materials within cosmetics offers a range of benefits, including increased transparency and solubility, there has been increasing debate over the potential risks associated {{with a number of}} the nano-materials already found in these products. While such concerns are not unique to the cosmetics sector, due to the direct application of these products onto the human skin, concern has been expressed over the potential health effects of nanotechnology-based cosmetics. This is despite the fact that cosmetic products are subject to regulatory controls within every jurisdiction in which they are sold. With debate over the safety of cosmetics containing nano-materials likely to escalate in line with the number of products entering the marketplace, this article examines the adequacy of the current regulatory framework for cosmetics containing nanoscale materials within one of the world’s largest cosmetic’s market, the European Union.

40|$|The present {{research}} was conducted to extract keratin protein from chicken feathers. Protein is an important nutrient needed by our body to maintain body structures and is an important ingredient for cosmetic products. Chicken feathers have high level of keratin protein content and can become a suitable protein source. The main processes involved are first dissolving chicken feat hers using different reducing agents and later on separating the protein from chemicals. Reducing agents used are potassium cyanide, thioglycolic acid and sodium sulphide. Once the feathers are dissolved using reducing agents, ammonium sulfate solution {{is added to the}} solution for the precipitation of protein. The precipitated protein is washed with water several times and sodium hydroxide solution is used to obtain protein back in the solution form. Out of three different reducing agents used, sodium sulfide gives the highest efficiency in dissolving chicken feathers since the feathers are dissolved in {{a very short period of}} time. The percentage of keratin protein is evaluated by means of biuret test and FTIR analysis. The analysis by FTIR confirmed the presence of carboxyl acid and amino groups in the protein solution. The biuret test he lps in determining the concentration of protein obtained from different methods. Thus these two tests confirm the presence of protein in the solution. From this research, it can be concluded that protein can be extracted from chicken feathers. The keratin protein solution can be used for several purposes such as <b>anti-aging</b> <b>cream,</b> shampoo, and conditioner and for medical purposes such as bone replacement and bone graft...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the cultural differences in female consumers’ motivation to purchase appearance-enhancing products, particularly <b>anti-aging</b> <b>creams.</b> Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a qualitative research design to collect the data. Focus group discussions were used. The participants were selected from Thai and Australian females, 25 - 45 years old in Melbourne representing the most frequent users of anti-aging products. Findings: The results indicated variations among participants in their motivation to seek a better appearance. The motivation ranged from a combination of striving to achieve an ideal self and a high level of social acceptability through maintaining youthful appearance and improving on the perceived declining youthful appearance. Using anti-aging products turned out to be a means for taking care of oneself, achieving better social acceptability and improving self-image. These key motivations are inspired by the individual’s social condition and from the reactions they receive from others. These motivations are shared by all participants, but within different cultural perspectives. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation is in relation to the true expression of attitudes by respondents, particularly in regard to the discussion of privately held beliefs about self-image, social acceptability and personal appearance. Additionally, the variations between cultural perceptions are only indicative of real differences between collectivist and individualistic cultures. Practical implications: Managers can adopt a cultural framework for understanding their consumers’ motivations to enhance their appearance, formulate more accurately their marketing strategy and activate and satisfy their consumers’ demand and better inform their new product developments. Originality/value: The analysis explains and compares the differences and similarities in female consumers’ motivations for anti-aging product consumption of two fundamentally different cultural value systems...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical and {{geometrical}} cues influence cell behaviour. At {{the tissue}} level, almost all organs exhibit immediate mechanical responsiveness, in particular by increasing their stiffness {{in direct proportion}} to an applied mechanical stress. It was recently shown in cultured-cell models, in particular with fibroblasts, that the frequency of the applied stress is a fundamental stimulating parameter. However, the influence of the stimulus frequency at the tissue level has remained elusive. Using a device to deliver an oscillating torque that generates cyclic strain at different frequencies, we studied the effect(s) of mild skin massage in an ex vivo model and in vivo. Skin explants were maintained ex vivo for 10 days and massaged twice daily for one minute at various frequencies within the range of 65 - 85 Hz. Biopsies were analysed at D 0, D 5 and D 10 and processed for immuno-histological staining specific to various dermal proteins. As compared to untreated skin explants, the massaging procedure clearly led to higher rates of expression, in particular for decorin, fibrillin, tropoelastin, and procollagen- 1. The mechanical stimulus thus evoked an anti-aging response. Strikingly, the expression was found to depend on the stimulus frequency with maximum expression at 75 Hz. We then tested whether this mechanical stimulus had an anti-aging effect in vivo. Twenty Caucasian women (aged 65 - 75 y) applied a commercial <b>anti-aging</b> <b>cream</b> to the face and neck, followed by daily treatments using the anti-aging massage device for 8 weeks. A control group of twenty-two women, with similar ages to the first group, applied the cream alone.

40|$|The {{exposure}} to ultraviolet radiations (UVR) {{is the key}} source of skin sunburn; it may produce harmful entities, reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to aging. The skin can be treated and protected from the injurious effects of ROS by using various pharmaceutical formulations, such as cream. Cream can be loaded with antioxidants to quench ROS leading to photo-protective effects. Moreover, modern medicines depend on ethnobotanicals for protection or treatment of human diseases. This review article summarizes various in vivo antioxidant studies on herbal creams loaded with phyto-extracts. These formulations may serve as cosmeceuticals to protect skin against injurious effects of UVR. The botanicals studied for dermatologic use in cream form include Acacia nilotica, Benincasa hispida, Calendula officinalis, Camellia sinensis, Camellia sinensis, Nelumbo nucifera, Capparis decidua, Castanea sativa, Coffea arabica, Crocus sativus, Emblica officinalis Gaertn, Foeniculum vulgare, Hippophae rhamnoides, Lithospermum erythrorhizon, Malus domestica, Matricaria chamomilla L., Moringa oleifera, Morus alba, Ocimum basilicum, Oryza sativa, Polygonum minus, Punica granatum, Silybum marianum, Tagetes erecta Linn., Terminalia chebula, Trigonella foenum-graecum, and Vitis vinifera. The observed <b>anti-aging</b> effects of <b>cream</b> formulations could be an outcome of a coordinating action of multiple constituents.

40|$|Introduction : Fibroblast {{growth factor}} 1 (FGF- 1) is a {{powerful}} mitogen involved in the stimulation of DNA synthesis {{and the proliferation of}} a wide variety of cell types. Fibroblast growth factor 1 was genetically modified to improve its thermal stability and resistance to protease degradation without losing its biological activity. Aim : To study the impact of Q 40 P/S 47 I/H 93 G rFGF- 1 on skin cells, its penetration through the skin and the evaluation of the rFGF- 1 -cosmetic product properties. Material and methods : In vitro studies included the examination of primary fibroblast and keratinocyte viability after the incubation with rFGF- 1. The penetration abilities of rFGF- 1 in various formulations and carrier systems were examined ex vivo by the Raman spectroscopy. In vivo studies – HF Ultrasound and 3 D Imaging System – were used to evaluate the <b>anti-aging</b> properties of <b>creams</b> containing rFGF- 1. Results : In vitro studies demonstrated that rFGF- 1 strongly enhanced the viability of the treated cells. The Raman Spectroscopy analysis indicated that rFGF- 1 encapsulated in lipid spheres penetrate through the stratum corneum to the depth of 60 μm, and added to the o/w formulation – could penetrate to a depth of 90 μm. The results obtained from Primos revealed the reduction of the volume and the depth of the wrinkles. Changes in the skin structure in the analyzed areas were evaluated by HF Ultrasonography. Conclusions : Recombinant FGF- 1 strongly stimulated fibroblast and keratinocyte proliferation. However, the transition of this protein through the SC required an appropriate carrier system – lipid spheres. All tests – in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo – have proved that rFGF- 1 is a substance with a potentially wide spectrum of use...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Surgical Sciences)) —University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Aims: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} arterial variations by cadaveric dissection, in the forehead, in order to validate the practicality and implementation of planned forehead flaps and to increase the safety of forehead flaps in plastic and reconstructive surgery. Hypothesis tested: Unique frontal forehead flaps can be safely based on anatomical dissection and on the presence of the central vein and the anastomosing branches of the frontal ramifications of the angular artery (AA). Materials & methods: The study had two strategic components: an anatomical cadaveric study and a clinical study, based on the newly described forehead vasculature. The anatomical study consisted of a) dissection of 30 latex infused cadavers and 20 non-latexed cadavers; b) histological assessment of forehead vasculature of 20 cadavers. The clinical applicability study consisted of a cohort of 12 plastic and reconstructive surgery cases, undergoing nasal rhinoplasty, based on the cadaveric study and anatomical vasculature. The research was conducted within an ethical protocol and all patients gave informed consent. The follow-up period is 2 years. Results: In the cadaveric dissection, the following vessels, relevant to forehead flaps and nasal reconstruction, were consistently identified: DNA, FBSTA, STrA, TFA, AA, CA, CV, PCA, SOA and OV. Side branch analysis of STrA (N = 43) showed: MCB (60 %), LCB (23 %), SPA (26 %), OB (19 %), single VB (47 %), medial and lateral VB (53 %). Side branches of the supra-orbital artery (SOA) were: LRB (91 %), OB (91 %), VB (100 %), MB (44 %), BB (5 %) and SVB (9 %). Side branch profile of the angular artery (AA) was: DNA (96 %), CB (67 %) and PCA (47 %). In 71 % of cases the origin of the PCA was from the angular artery (AA). Individual artery side branches of the forehead were as follows: STrA (9), SOA (6), FBSTA (4), DNA (4), AA (3 / 4), CA (2) and PCA (2). Average diameter of the small arteries at point of entry ranged from 1 – 2 mm (CA < 1 mm, PCA < 1 mm). The central vein was a constant finding in all dissections and an important landmark. Other constant veins detected included the nasofrontal, ophthalmic, angular, supra-trochlear and facial veins. Twelve prospective randomized patients met inclusion criteria for nasal flap reconstruction, based on the cadaveric vascular study. Race profile was white (6), mixed (4) and black (2). There were 8 males and 4 females. Disease demographics included cancer (6; melanoma 2, basal cell cancer 5), trauma (3), infections (1) and congenital (1). Post-operative grading was as follows: defects corrected (12 / 12), subjective improvement (12 / 12), objective improvement (12 / 12), partial flap necrosis (1 / 12) and secondary interventions (debulking or revision 2 / 12). Doppler assessment for pedicle vasculature showed identification of the following arteries: TFA (85 %), STrA (65 %), PCA (20 %) and AA (25 %). Doppler studies further indicated the following small side branches: TFA (49 %), STrA (30 %), PCA (9 %), AA (12 %). The central vein was identified in 9 / 12 (75 %) by macroscopic examination. In one female with a basal cell carcinoma (BCC), modest dermal stock loss was demonstrated by the application of high frequency dermal ultrasound (Dermascan®). The results of the cadaveric anatomy study show the existence of various important subtle arterial variations in the forehead that are not described in the literature. Many arterial side branches not clearly named and others not described before, were highlighted in this anatomical study. Other observations regarding the anatomical relationships of the forehead nerves were of practical surgical value, the most important being to reduce sensory neuropraxia. The histological study endorsed the cadaver dissection observations and showed the importance of the flap vasculature at the proximal level of the pedicle. The clinical study with follow-up period of 24 months, illustrates an evolving refinement in surgical technique based on the findings of the anatomic vasculature study. A new method of planning a “ 2500 -year-old operation” was confidently developed based on the anatomical vasculature observations detected during the cadaver study. The Doppler study suggests that crude arterial variations of the central forehead, in the region of the intended flap pedicle, can not be diagnosed and highlighted accurately pre-operatively. The macroscopic anatomy of the central vein (clinical landmark) is an accurate predictor of underlying arterial variations and may be more valuable clinically than the hand-held Doppler examination. Conclusion: Comprehensive vascular anatomical detail of the forehead was not described accurately or completely by clinical anatomists in the past and does not appear in classic text books of anatomy and morphology. This has led to one-dimensional (arterial) application of the midline forehead flap planning and eventually the introduction of the para-median forehead flap, which has become the modern “work horse” of forehead flaps for nasal reconstruction. Now that in a definitive cadaveric study of the forehead blood supply has been demonstrated, the results show that surgeons will once again be able to embrace the midline forehead flap, only this time there will be possibly no inconsistent descriptions of unnamed blood vessels or ill-defined landmarks for flap planning. New flaps and reconstructive options in or around the forehead will be hopefully planned and executed more effectively and safer based on a more comprehensive understanding of the forehead anatomy and vasculature. The subjective and objective end-point analysis of the clinical study show favourable measured outcomes in the interim follow-up period (24 months) and benefit to the patients, in the presence of a low percentage of flap loss (1 / 12; 8. 3 %). The use of pre-operative Doppler assessment helped with flap planning. In one patient, the application of high frequency ultrasound facilitated long term follow-up regarding recurrent tumour formation and enhancement of dermal consistency with <b>anti-aging</b> <b>creams,</b> vitamin A derivations and sunscreens. Recommendations: The classic anatomy text books and clinical plastic surgery works with their inconsistent descriptions of the central forehead blood supply (arterial and venous) need to be updated. The evolution of the midline forehead flap method is far from complete. The refinement of the one-stage midline forehead flap method without an island is in progress and can clinically be implemented, based on a sound anatomical dissection study...|$|R
