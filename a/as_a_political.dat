5|$|An {{explanation}} {{put forward}} by the Russian Government appeared {{to be that the}} deaths of Litvinenko and Politkovskaya were intended to embarrass President Putin.

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> philosophy, one-nation {{conservatism}} {{reflects the}} belief that societies exist and develop organically, and that members within them have obligations towards each other.

5|$|As can {{be discerned}} from the {{previous}} description, the 1945 campaign was anything but genteel and polite. Jolliffe replied by giving a radio speech (written {{with the assistance of}} Lister Sinclair) that accused Drew of running a political Gestapo in Ontario.

5|$|Following the 2002 {{deterioration}} of his health, al-Jamri's position <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> and religious leader of Bahrain's Shia opposition {{was taken over}} by his lifelong friend, Ayatollah Isa Qassim. Qassim was less revolutionary than al-Jamri, having opposed the 1992 and 1994 petitions, but his views were kept private, in part as a sign of respect for al-Jamri. Al-Jamri's role as leader of the opposition remained empty, as the opposition became fragmented.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi used fasting <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> device, often {{threatening}} suicide unless demands were met. Congress publicised the fasts <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> {{action that}} generated widespread sympathy. In response the {{government tried to}} manipulate news coverage to minimise his challenge to the Raj. He fasted in 1932 to protest the voting scheme for separate political representation for Dalits; Gandhi did not want them segregated. The British government stopped the London press from showing photographs of his emaciated body, because it would elicit sympathy. Gandhi's 1943 hunger strike took place during a two-year prison term for the anticolonial Quit India movement. The government called on nutritional experts to demystify his action, and again no photos were allowed. However, his final fast in 1948, {{after the end of}} British rule in India, his hunger strike was lauded by the British press and this time did include full-length photos.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, Magna Carta became {{increasingly}} important <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> document in arguments over {{the authority of}} the English monarchy.

5|$|The Cripple Creek strike also {{transformed}} the Western Federation of Miners enormously <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> entity. The year-old union, weak and penniless before the strike, became widely admired among miners throughout the West. Thousands of workers joined the union {{over the next}} few years. Politicians and labor officials throughout the country became steady allies of the union, and the WFM became a political force throughout much of the Rocky Mountain West.|$|E
5|$|The project {{also served}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> ruse {{on the part}} of the American government, {{providing}} a diplomatic channel for NASA to take part in the funding of the cripplingly under-funded Russian space program.
