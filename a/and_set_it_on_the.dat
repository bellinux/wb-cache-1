25|$|Walton {{also ordered}} the storm {{door at the}} {{entrance}} to the White House beneath the North Portico removed so that the coffin would pass more easily through the portal. The door was removed, but the frame (embedded in concrete) was not. Black crepe was tacked around the door to cover it. Shriver had the White House driveway lit with small firepots. Kennedy's body arrived at the White House at about 4:30 A.M. The military casket team moved the coffin into the East Room <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> catafalque. Walton gave General Godfrey McHugh, Kennedy's chief military aide, a spray of flowers to place at the long base of the catafalque.|$|E

500|$|O'Bannon soon {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} work on Alejandro Jodorowsky's adaptation of Dune, a project which took him to Paris for six months. Though the project ultimately fell through, it introduced him to several artists whose work gave him ideas for his science-fiction story including Chris Foss, H. R. Giger, and Jean [...] "Moebius" [...] Giraud. O'Bannon was impressed by Foss's covers for science fiction books, while he found Giger's work [...] "disturbing": [...] "His paintings {{had a profound effect}} on me. I had never seen anything that was quite as horrible and at the same time as beautiful as his work. And so I ended up writing a script about a Giger monster." [...] After the Dune project collapsed, O'Bannon returned to Los Angeles to live with Shusett and the two revived his Memory script. Shusett suggested that O'Bannon use one of his other film ideas, about gremlins infiltrating a B-17 bomber during World War II, <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spaceship as the second half of the story. The working title of the project was now Star Beast, but O'Bannon disliked this and changed it to Alien after noting the number of times that the word appeared in the script. He and Shusett liked the new title's simplicity and its double meaning as both a noun and an adjective. Shusett came up with the idea that one of the crew members could be implanted with an alien embryo that would burst out of him; he thought this would be an interesting plot device by which the alien could get aboard the ship.|$|E

When the frame was full, the whole made one solid block of type. He then placed it near the fire to warm it. When the paste [...] was {{slightly}} melted, he took a smooth board and pressed it over the surface, so that the block of type became as even as a whetstone.|$|E
