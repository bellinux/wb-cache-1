You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 the Roman Catholic Church {{sex abuse}} scandal {{involving}} local priests became public. The Archdiocese of Boston {{was found to}} have knowingly moved priests who sexually molested children from parish to parish and to have covered up abuse. The revelations caused the resignation of the archbishop, Cardinal Bernard Law, and resulted in a $85 million settlement with the victims. With the large Irish and Italian Catholic populations in Boston, this was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>concern.</b> The diocese, under financial pressure, closed many of its churches. In some churches, parishioners camped out in the churches to protest and block closure.|$|E
25|$|A {{heat sink}} is {{designed}} to maximize its surface area {{in contact with the}} cooling medium surrounding it, such as the air. Air velocity, choice of material, protrusion design and surface treatment are factors that affect the performance of a heat sink. Heat sink attachment methods and thermal interface materials also affect the die temperature of the integrated circuit. Thermal adhesive or thermal grease improve the heat sink's performance by filling air gaps between the heat sink and the heat spreader on the device. A heat sink is usually made out of copper and/or aluminium. Copper is used because it has many desirable properties for thermally efficient and durable heat exchangers. First and foremost, copper is an excellent conductor of heat. This means that copper's high thermal conductivity allows heat to pass through it quickly. Aluminium is used in applications where weight is <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>concern.</b>|$|E
25|$|Industrial {{pollution}} is <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>concern</b> in Kazakhstan's manufacturing cities, where aging factories pump huge quantities of unfiltered pollutants {{into the air}} and groundwater. The former capital, Almaty, is particularly threatened, {{in part because of the}} postindependence boom in private automobile ownership.|$|R

500|$|Professional teams coveted Gyorko for his hitting ability, {{though they}} did not expect him to play shortstop at the {{professional}} level. Though his throwing arm was viewed as strong enough {{to allow him to}} play at any position in the infield, analysts believed that Gyorko would not have sufficient range or speed to play shortstop professionally, and Gyorko understood he would likely change positions. Regarding his defense, Gyorko said [...] "where I play [...] isn't <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>concern</b> for me. I'm just ready for this chance to live a dream and it will all work out." ...|$|E
500|$|The Queen Anne's Revenge {{was built}} atop the Sunset, the same ship used {{to depict the}} Black Pearl in {{previous}} installments. On February 2010, the Sunset was sailed from Long Beach to a shipyard in Hawaii for the reforms, where <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>concern</b> was to make it imposing, with three stories, without sacrificing actual seakeeping. Given Blackbeard {{was meant to be}} the meanest pirate to appear in the series, the look for the Queen Anne's Revenge was ominous, with sails dyed blood red, various elements on fire, and a decoration based on skulls and bones (drawing inspiration from the Sedlec Ossuary in Czech Republic). Damage from cannon fire was also added to show that [...] "not only Blackbeard was a dying man, but his ship is also a dying ship". The ship's figurehead also drew inspiration from Blackbeard's pirate flag. The replica ship HMS Surprise was used for Barbossa's ship, the HMS Providence, and all the scenes aboard the Providence were shot on the Long Beach shore as the Surprise could not be sailed to Hawaii. Over 50 designs were considered for the Fountain of Youth, with the final one representing a temple built by an ancient civilization around the Fountain, which itself was located in a round rocky structure to represent [...] "the circle of life". The locations leading up to the Fountain were shot in the Hawaiian islands of Kauai and Oahu, but the Fountain itself was built at the 007 Stage on Pinewood.|$|E

50|$|Glacial lake {{outburst}} floods {{may become}} <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>concern</b> {{due to the}} retreat of glaciers, leaving behind numerous lakes that are impounded by often weak terminal moraine dams. In the past, the sudden failure of these dams has resulted in localized property damage, injury and deaths. Glacial lakes in danger of bursting can have their moraines replaced with concrete dams (which may also provide hydroelectric power).|$|R
2500|$|For {{many people}} {{choosing}} an office suite, prime considerations include how much value having learned that office suite {{will prove to}} potential employers, and how well the software interoperates with other users. [...] That is, since learning to use an office suite takes many hours, users want to invest that time learning the office suite that will make them most attractive to potential employers and clients, and {{they also want to}} be able to share documents. Similarly, finding already-trained employees is <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>concern</b> for employers when deciding which office suite to purchase or standardize on.|$|E
2500|$|Piracy {{was also}} <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>concern</b> for the Pope. Domagoj {{was accused of}} attacking a ship which was {{bringing}} home the papal legates {{who had participated in}} the Eighth Catholic Ecumenical Council. In 874, Pope John VIII intervened by requesting Duke Domagoj as a Christian to restrain the pirates who were in his name ravaging the Adriatic assaulting Christian sailors and that exile would be a more suitable punishment for the rebels instead of death penalties, but his request wasn't successful. Pope John VIII referred to Domagoj in letters as [...] "Famous duke" [...] (...) , but also wrote that he won't find Domagoj innocent if piracy was not dealt with.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the size}} of the parasite, as adult F. hepatica: [...] or adult F. gigantica: 25–75×12mm, fasciolosis is <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>concern.</b> The amount of {{symptoms}} depend on how many worms and what stage the infection is in. The death rate is significant in both sheep and cattle, but generally low among humans. Treatment with triclabendazole has been highly effective against the adult worms as well as various developing stages. Praziquantel is not effective, and older drugs such as bithionol are moderately effective but also cause more side effects. Secondary bacterial infection causing cholangitis [...] has also been a concern and can be treated with antibiotics, and toxaemia may be treated with prednisolone.|$|E

50|$|Higher {{temperatures}} are <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>concern</b> because {{the possibility of}} an explosion increases as the temperatures rise. A fire at one of these facilities would endanger the surrounding community as well as the personnel at the installations. Perhaps more so for the community having much less access to protective equipment and specialized training. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory conducted a study to assess capabilities and costs for protecting civilian populations during related emergencies, and the effectiveness of expedient, in-place shelters.|$|R
50|$|At Cogenhoe, the pre-war {{coach firm}} of York Brothers (George and Fred York) {{continued}} to {{flourish in the}} 1950s. They operated a stage carriage route between Wollaston and Northampton, via many of the local villages, but, also ran a travel company with coach excursions to {{all parts of the}} country. As their bus fleet grew, they swallowed up several of the smaller concerns and became not just an important local employer but also developed a national reputation for quality. Yorks, as part of <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>concern,</b> finally closed for business in 2012.|$|R
2500|$|Nabokov was {{considered}} one of the elite goaltenders in the NHL, and was often ranked {{as one of the top}} ten, if not top five goaltenders in the NHL by magazines like ESPN The Magazine and The Hockey News. However, the 2005–06 season was an off year for Nabokov as his save percentage of under [...]900 was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>concern</b> to the team. He was relegated to the role of backup goaltender behind Vesa Toskala. Despite his less-than-stellar play, Nabokov was signed to a four-year contract extension worth roughly $21.5 million in February 2006. The contract had a no-trade clause that was activated on the condition that San Jose made the playoffs.|$|E

As a result, the train derailed, dropping six people to the ground ten feet below with minor injuries. The mishap was possibly caused by the passengers rocking the car, damaging the coupler. The original trains were removed and replaced with newer Century Flyer trains. During the era when Hoffman owned Lincoln Park, safety became <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>concern,</b> and more accidents on the Comet resulted in its closing.|$|R

5000|$|Widespread {{need for}} secure data {{destruction}} meant that language-variants {{of the program}} needed to be developed to support demand. Coverage of the product in countries like Germany and Singapore lead to excessive downloading and general popularity. PC Magazine included Data Shredder {{as one of its}} must-have security tools. [...] A large increase in electronic waste due to high quanitites of old computers being thrown out as garbage in dumps and landfills made security of data stored on hard drives <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>concern</b> of the general public.

It had ceased to be a blank space of {{delightful}} mystery--a white patch for a boy to dream gloriously over. It had become a place of darkness. But there was in it one river especially, a mighty big river, that you could see on the map, resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country, and its tail lost {{in the depths of the}} land. And as I looked at the map of it in a shop-window, it fascinated me as a snake would a bird--a silly little bird. Then I remembered there was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>concern,</b> a Company for trade on that river. Dash it all! I thought to myself, they can't trade without using some kind of craft on that lot of fresh water--steamboats! Why shouldn't I try to get charge of one? I went on along Fleet Street, but could not shake off the idea. The snake had charmed me.|$|E

40|$|Leaf {{diseases}} are appearing on corn {{in many areas}} of the state. This is not too surprising, considering the amount of rain we have had. Fortunately, in most fields so far the symptoms are due to holcus spot or anthracnose, which do not tend to spread rapidly among the plants during mid-season. Anthracnose has become severe in some fields following the heavy rains, but the new leaves should escape infection. No in-season control measures are recommended for anthracnose. Other {{diseases are}} appearing and some of these are <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>concern,</b> especially in seed corn.

50|$|An {{overview}} of failed Atlas test flights {{showed that there}} were only a few times that malfunctions occurred suddenly and without prior warning, for instance on Missile 6B when one turbopump failed 80 seconds into the launch. Otherwise, most failures were preceded by obvious deviations from the booster's normal operating parameters. Automatic abort was only necessary in a situation like Atlas 6B where the failure happened so fast that there would be no time for a manual abort and most failure modes left enough time for the astronaut or ground controllers to manually activate the LES. <b>A</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>concern</b> was setting up the abort system so as to not go off when normal, minor performance deviations occurred.|$|R

Aboriginal hunting cultures were not taken into consideration when these laws were enforced, instead the preservation of the bison was <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>concern</b> to the federal government. After 1945, government wildlife workers became interested in developing the North and realized the economic benefits that the bison could provide them.

2500|$|In 1969, Porter and his {{maintenance}} technician {{modified the}} 12-input, 4-output mixing console {{to give it}} 8 outputs, and made their own 8-track tape recorder from Ampex parts. In August, Presley's producer Felton Jarvis brought the master tape for [...] "Suspicious Minds" [...] into United Recording so that Porter could help him with the song's unusual fade out and back in three-quarters of the way through. <b>A</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>concern</b> was that Jarvis wanted a horn section {{but there were no}} empty tracks left on the tape. Porter solved the dilemma by mixing the horns live in the studio as the original session tape played back, the total blend being recorded onto a stereo master.
