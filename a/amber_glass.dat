5|$|The Nassers and Naify {{contracted}} with Pflueger in early 1926 to build three large movie theaters in central California cities. They assigned Pflueger {{the design of}} the Tulare Theatre (1927) in Tulare, the Senator Theatre (1928) in Chico and the State Theatre (1928) in Oroville. The $250,000 Tulare Theatre (now demolished) featured motifs based on the Ishtar Gate of Babylon. Pflueger included zigzag patterns in the twin-towered facade trimmed in neon accents, and brought Streamline Moderne stylings to the interior via sweeping curves in steel banister railings as well as Mayan touches in the stepped mirrors. The $250,000 State Theatre appeared Spanish Colonial with its tiled roof and concrete bas-relief exterior, but turned to Streamline Moderne in a 1,529-seat interior that featured chrome railings, plush carpet and indirect lighting. Aztec elements were incorporated in the proscenium design. The $300,000 Senator Theatre was delayed in construction by the discovery of running water under the foundation, a condition that required channelization and pumps. The movie palace's eclectic theme was largely Egyptian with Moorish, Asian and Aztec details dominated by a landmark tower topped by a giant faceted <b>amber</b> <b>glass</b> gem lit from within.|$|E
5|$|The Kowalewko {{cemetery}} in Greater Poland {{is one of}} the largest in Poland and is distinguished by a great number of beautiful relics, made locally or imported from the Empire. The total number of burials is estimated at over 500, most of which have been excavated. 60 percent of the bodies were not cremated and typically placed in wooden coffins constructed of board or plank pieces. The burial ground was in use from the mid-1st century AD to about 220, which gives approximately 80 area inhabitants per generation. Remnants of settlements in the region have also been investigated. At Rogowo near Chełmno a Wielbark settlement, an industrial production site and a 2nd to 3rd century bi-ritual cemetery with very richly furnished graves have been discovered. In the area of Ulkowy, Gdańsk County a settlement consisting of both sunken floor and post construction dwellings, as well as a burial ground in use from the mid-1st century to the second half of the 3rd century were found. Only a part of the cemetery was excavated on the occasion of a motorway construction, but it yielded 110 inhumations (11 in hollowed-out log coffins) and 15 cremations (8 of them in urns) and a rich collection of decorative objects, mostly from the graves of women. Those include fancy jewelry and accessories made of gold, silver, bronze, <b>amber,</b> <b>glass</b> and enameled plates. Ceramics, utility items and tools including weaving equipment were recovered from the settlement site. Other significant Wielbark settlements in the area were encountered in Swarożyn and Stanisławie, both in Tczew County.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} has undergone alterations and renovations during its history. The original stone stairs {{on the exterior}} were removed and replaced. Most of the structure's alterations occurred during the 1940s and were on its interior. Inside, there were originally two alcoves off the vestibule which contained stoves used for heating. These alcoves have since been enclosed: one serves as the basement stairway access and the other as a closet. Other changes during the 1940s include {{the addition of a}} projecting bay behind the pulpit and <b>amber</b> <b>glass</b> panes to the windows.|$|E

It {{is possible that the}} darker green and <b>amber</b> <b>glasses</b> were deliberately coloured to imitate bronze vessels [41 : p. 48]. The current analysis of the Hellenistic vessel glasses from Jebel Khalid aimed to investigate these visual distinctions of form, style and colour by characterising and comparing their chemical compositions.|$|R

25|$|The amber bulbs {{commonly}} used in turn signals with colourless lenses are no longer made with cadmium glass, since various regulations worldwide, including the European RoHS directive, banned cadmium because of its toxicity. <b>Amber</b> <b>glass</b> made without cadmium is relatively costly, so most amber bulbs are now made with clear glass dipped in an amber coating. Some of these coatings are not as durable as the bulb envelopes; with prolonged heat-cool cycles, the coating may flake off the bulb glass, or its colour may fade. This causes the turn signal to emit white light, rather than the required amber light.|$|E

50|$|The {{photodegradation}} of pharmaceuticals is {{of interest}} because they are found in many water supplies. They have deleterious effects on aquatic organisms including toxicity, endocrine disruption, genetic damage. But also in the primary packaging material the photodegradation of pharmaceuticals has to be prevented. For this, <b>amber</b> <b>glasses</b> like Fiolax <b>amber</b> and Corning 51-L are commonly used to protect the pharmaceutical from UV radiations.

30|$|The {{translucent}} glass vessels {{of this study}} are consistent with and typical of 1 st millennium BCE Hellenistic production in the eastern Mediterranean region. Vessel form, style, manufacture method and colour are independent of reduced glass composition. Glasses are decoloured with manganese, which also produced one purple glass. Blue is produced in one sample by cobalt with a little copper, and one green and one blue glass are coloured by copper. Other bluish and green glasses are the result of iron contamination in the batch. <b>Amber</b> <b>glasses</b> are likely the result of the presence of iron and sulphur in a ferri-sulphide complex.|$|R

2500|$|Ordinary {{soda-lime}} glass appears colorless {{to the naked}} eye when it is thin, although iron(II) oxide (FeO) impurities of up to 0.1 wt% produce a green tint, which can be viewed in thick pieces or with the aid of scientific instruments. Further FeO and chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3) additions may be used for the production of green bottles. Sulfur, together with carbon and iron salts, is used to form iron polysulfides and produce <b>amber</b> <b>glass</b> ranging from yellowish to almost black. A glass melt can also acquire an amber color from a reducing combustion atmosphere. Manganese dioxide can be added in small amounts to remove the green tint given by iron(II) oxide.

2500|$|The {{church was}} listed as Grade II*, number 1149449, on 18 July 1949 {{on the grounds that}} the tower and chancel {{constitute}} a medieval element of the dressed and coursed sandstone structure. It has graded-slate roofs. The chancel is lower and narrower than the nave, and was built in the 14thcentury, the east window tracery dates from 1350. Parts of the chancel may be remnants of the earlier 13th-century stone church. The tower was added at the west end in the 15th or 16thcentury. During the ministry of William Raper and after becoming derelict, the nave was rebuilt in 1772 with Georgian elements in the churchwarden style, including [...] "rounded Georgian windows with <b>amber</b> <b>glass,</b> a plaster ceiling with a decorated cornice, box pews and a three-decker pulpit (all now gone). It was restored during the ministry of Mark Rowntree in 1882 to 1884 while the church was closed. He replaced the box pews with pitch pine ones and removed the three-decker pulpit. He lowered the nave floor by [...] and raised the chancel floor and ceiling to create the Bentley's burial crypt below. It was probably at this time that the present arch braced truss ceiling was installed. Before Rowntree's work, the nave floor was higher than those of the tower and chancel. The same section was remodelled again in 1929 when the ceiling and some oak roof beams were replaced, and electric light installed. In 1930 perpendicular windows replaced the Georgian ones. In 1934 the church acquired an organ loft in the tower arch and the ground floor of the tower became a vestry. On the south side a porch and choir vestry were added in 1952, the glazed and polygonal chapter house was built in 1977 and the parish meeting rooms and kitchen in 1988 or 1999.|$|E

40|$|In {{previous}} work we successfully used a stable Dominican amber {{to investigate the}} sub-glass transition dynamics of an organic glass with extremely low fictive temperature. The results provided an incentive to seek other stable ambers with lower values of fictive temperature. In the present work, a series of fossil resins from different locations, and ages ranging from approximately 100 years– 230 million years, has been investigated using differential scanning calorimetry. The measurement results show the thermal signatures for each fossil sample: copals are unstable, and have lower glass transition temperatures than the amber samples. For the amber samples, {{there is not a}} systematic age dependence for the <b>amber's</b> <b>glass</b> transition temperature.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Amber</b> and <b>Glass.</b> The aim of {{this project}} is, through {{thermodynamic}} studies, heating- and cooling experiments, and DSC-scanning, {{to decide whether or}} not <b>amber</b> is a <b>glass.</b> To measure a glass transition temperature in amber, it has been necessary to alter an already existing experiment from measuring glass transition temperatures between 77 K and room temperature, to temperatures between room temperature and 573 K by the use of an oven. We have come up with a hypothesis that polymerization, release of volatile molecules and the forming of crosslinks in resin, has raised the glass transition temperature above the temperature of the resin, through millions of years, so that the material has glassed. The glass transition temperature has continuously been raised. The amber has polymerized further through millions of years, even though the surrounding temperature has been far below the glass transition temperature. We have constructed a definition of glass, and we conclude through our own experiments and literature studies, that amber from Haiti is a naturally occurring glass...|$|R
