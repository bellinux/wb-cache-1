5|$|Judicial Commissioner Menon also {{mentioned}} another {{exception to the}} justiciability rule: when the courts are able to isolate a pure question of law from what is seemingly a non-justiciable issue. However, the judge did not explain this exception further, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> yet been applied or discussed in any other Singapore case.|$|E
5|$|M-105 was the {{designation}} of a former state trunkline highway in The Thumb region of the US state of Michigan. It served as a connecting route between M-53 in Popple and M-83 (now M-142) near Elkton. The designation was in use in the 1920s and 1930s, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been reused since.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{orders for}} the aircraft, the company {{announced}} in August 2008 that development of the Eclipse 400 was on hold <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> started the certification process. The company declared <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> spent any of the deposit money for the Eclipse 400 but the deposits were later a subject of legal action.|$|R
50|$|Various reasons can be {{advanced}} for {{the failure}} of Purver’s translation; lack of publicity; the fact that it lacked authority (a one-man translation) <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been backed by any Church, not even the Religious Society of Friends, to which Purver belonged. Yet the failure to make its mark may owe itself to the deficiencies of his translation.|$|R

5|$|A {{position}} paper {{published by the}} American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2007 warns {{that there is no}} valid medical reason to perform the procedure, which is not considered routine or accepted by the College; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been proven to be safe or effective. The potential risks include sexual dysfunction, infection, altered sensation, dyspareunia, adhesions and scarring. The College position is that it is untenable to recommend the procedure. The procedure is also not approved by the Food and Drug Administration or the American Medical Association, and no peer-reviewed studies have been accepted to account for either safety or effectiveness of this treatment.|$|E
5|$|The Ethiopian {{highland}} hare {{is similar}} to the Abyssinian hare (Lepus habessinicus) which has grizzled, silvery gray dorsal pelage and has a narrow,black rim {{at the tip of the}} ears. It is also similar to the African savannah hare (Lepus victoriae) which has brown dorsal pelage grizzled with black, and ears having lesser black on tip. Its nuchal patch is brownish-orange to orange, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been observed to occur in the Ethiopian plateau.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{exhausted}} the JNA {{and proved}} {{a turning point}} in the Croatian war. A ceasefire was declared a few weeks later. Vukovar remained in Serb hands until 1998, when it was peacefully reintegrated into Croatia. It has since been rebuilt but has less than half of its pre-war population and many buildings are still scarred by the battle. Its two principal ethnic communities remain deeply divided <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> regained its former prosperity.|$|E
50|$|On {{the final}} {{original}} Dawson-era episode of Family Feud in 1985, Dawson publicly apologized about any misgivings, disagreements, or brawls {{he may have}} had with producers, particularly Felsher. However, according to Felsher, Dawson regretted making the remarks the next day. Dawson ordered his daughter-in-law, the producer, to cut the speech from the show <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been seen for 14 years.|$|R
25|$|Though a bloodless mock battle {{had been}} planned, Spanish troops had opened {{fire in a}} {{skirmish}} which left six Americans and forty-nine Spaniards dead when Filipino revolutionaries, thinking that the attack was genuine, joined advancing U.S. troops. Except for the unplanned casualties, the battle had gone according to plan; the Spanish had surrendered {{the city to the}} Americans, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> fallen to the Filipino revolutionaries.|$|R

5|$|While Voyager 1 is {{commonly}} spoken of as having left the Solar System simultaneously with having left the heliosphere, {{the two are}} not the same. The Solar System is usually defined as the vastly larger region of space populated by bodies that orbit the Sun. The craft is presently less than one seventh {{the distance to the}} aphelion of Sedna, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> yet entered the Oort cloud, the source region of long-period comets, regarded by astronomers as the outermost zone of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} {{can be held}} in captivity, though the Migratory Bird Treaty Act only allows this {{in the case of}} animals which are injured or unable to return to the wild. It {{receives}} special legal protections under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 in the United States, by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Canada, and by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds and Game Mammals in Mexico. In the United States it is illegal to take, kill, or possess black vultures and violation of the law is punishable by a fine of up to US$15,000 and imprisonment of up to six months. It is listed as a species of Least Concern by the IUCN Red List. Populations appear to remain stable, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> reached the threshold of inclusion as a threatened species, which requires a decline of more than 30% in ten years or three generations.|$|E
5|$|The {{litter size}} ranges {{from one to}} eight, with two to five being typical, {{increasing}} with female size. In Omanese waters, females on average outnumber males in a litter by more than 2:1, and all-female litters are not uncommon. Similar but less extreme sex imbalances have also been reported from litters of milk sharks off Senegal and eastern India. The reason for this imbalance is unknown, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been observed in related species such as the Atlantic sharpnose shark (R. terraenovae). Gestation of the embryos takes around a year and proceeds in three phases. In the first phase, lasting two months to an embryonic length of , the embryo relies on yolk for sustenance and gas exchange occurs across its surface integument and possibly also the yolk sac. During the second phase, which also lasts for two months to an embryonic length of , the external gill filaments develop and the yolk sac begins to be resorbed, the embyo ingesting histotroph (a nutritious substance secreted by the mother) in the meantime. In the third phase, lasting six to eight months, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the fetus receives nourishment until birth.|$|E

50|$|InQuest #0, {{the first}} issue, was {{published}} in April 1995. For issue #46 (February 1999), InQuest {{changed its name to}} InQuest Gamer (with Gamer in large text on the cover), clearly announcing that it was a magazine about games. Issue #53 made the InQuest title more prominent on the cover again <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been changed since then, though the cover's format was revamped with issue #122.|$|R
5|$|To {{prevent any}} similar {{incidents}} from reoccurring, Nintendo quickly ordered the episode pulled, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> aired since, not even outside Japan. Maddie Blaustein, the English dub voice of Meowth, said twice on the Serebii.net forums that this episode was dubbed in the United States by 4Kids Entertainment. On the other hand, Veronica Taylor, the English voice of Ash, claimed that this episode was never dubbed {{and will not}} be dubbed, though this was contradicted again on September 25, 2016, when Eric Stuart, the English dub voice of Brock and James, said that 4Kids did indeed dub the episode. Regardless, any plans to release this episode outside Japan were abandoned after Nintendo objected, and it was never broadcast anywhere else in the world. Coincidentally, the episode aired around the same time Pokémon was being adapted for American audiences. 4Kids Entertainment's dub took extra precaution in bright and flashing lights in the show, using the post-1997 versions altering lighting and the frequency of flashing lights for earlier episodes of their American release.|$|E
25|$|The Brandenburg test {{remains the}} {{standard}} used for evaluating attempts to punish inflammatory speech, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been seriously challenged {{since it was}} laid down in 1969. Very few cases have actually reached the Court during the past decades that would test the outer limits of Brandenburg, so the test remains largely unqualified. The Supreme Court applied in the test in Brandenburg four years later in Hess v. Indiana.|$|E
25|$|Munch's {{refusal to}} be drawn on this topic while he lived fed {{this version of the}} story. Later {{historical}} research has conclusively shown, however, that the accusations are completely without foundation, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been proven that such a meeting in Rostock even took place. Most historians classify the Rostock myth as a mere conspiracy theory. But that has not stopped the 'Rostock myth' from surfacing with regular intervals.|$|E

50|$|The mining on Catalina Island under Renton’s {{management}} was notable {{for the use}} of salt water flotation in separating the zinc and silver from the raw ore. In the 1920s, oil flotation was the standard process for collecting mineral particles from sulfide ore in a liquid slurry. At the time, salt water <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been used in a flotation mill <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been shown that organic compounds could be effective floating agents.|$|R

25|$|Typically, {{leaves are}} {{five to ten}} centimeters (2-4 inches) long and are roundly and deeply lobed. The leaf width is {{approximately}} one half its length. Each leaf is matte green with an underneath pale green appearance; moreover, the leaf is covered with abundant soft fuzz, yielding an almost velvety feeling. When a fresh leaf is rubbed or broken, an aromatic scent is exuded, evoking a forest odor. The wood is a dull brown approaching yellow, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been used extensively for milling.|$|E
25|$|Dick was recreated by {{his fans}} {{in the form of}} a simulacrum or {{remote-controlled}} android designed in his likeness. Such simulacra had been themes of many of Dick's works. The Philip K. Dick simulacrum was included on a discussion panel in a San Diego Comic Con presentation about the film adaptation of the novel, A Scanner Darkly. In February 2006, an America West Airlines employee misplaced the android's head, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> yet been found. In January 2011, it was announced that Hanson Robotics had built a replacement.|$|E
25|$|The past participle of {{the weak}} verbs has the ending -et or -t. The past participle of the strong verbs {{originally}} had the ending -en, neuter -et, but the common form is now restricted to the use as an adjective (e.g. en bunden opgave), <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been preserved in all verbs. When it is combined with er and har to form passive and perfect constructions, the neuter form, {{which happens to be}} identical to the ending {{of the weak}} verbs, is used. In the Jutlandic dialects, -en is frequently used in such constructions.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, {{producers}} {{introduced a}} limit {{on the number of}} speaking parts in each episode due to budget cuts, with an average of 16 characters per episode. The decision was criticised by Martin McGrath of Equity, who said: [...] "Trying to produce quality TV on the cheap is doomed to fail." [...] The BBC responded by saying they had been working that way for some time <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> affected the quality of the show.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, the Amt of Daun {{put forth a}} {{proposal}} to the Koblenz-Ehrenbreitstein State Archive for a few municipalities, among them Hörschhausen, for designs for coats of arms. Since no older seals or coats of arms were known, the designs were authorized. Nevertheless, {{it was not until}} 1980 that approval was granted for Hörschhausen to bear arms, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been until 1979 that the application had even been submitted to the Regierungsbezirk administration in Trier.|$|R
25|$|The {{region is}} also home to the largest airport in Croatia—the Zagreb Airport. In April 2012, a 30-year {{concession}} contract to develop and manage the airport as a regional transport centre was signed by the Government of Croatia and Zagreb Airport International Company Limited. The only navigable river in the region is the Sava, downstream of Sisak. The navigable route became disused after onset of the Croatian War of Independence in 1991, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been fully restored {{since the end of the}} war, limiting the size of vessels that may reach Sisak.|$|E

With the exception of Connecticut College, all NESCAC schools rank in the top 10% of Division III for # of varsity athletes. Connecticut College athletic spending and # of varsity athletes are lowest {{because it does not}} have a football team. Tufts per-student athletic spending is low because it has nearly double the undergraduate population (5,100) of its nearest NESCAC rival (Wesleyan, with 2,800), <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> emphasized athletic spending.|$|E
25|$|The {{youngest}} rock units {{consist of}} rough terra and smooth plains materials. Rough terra occurs as overlapping and intermixed ejecta blankets around dusters of large young craters {{in the eastern}} part of the quadrangle. The relief here appears to be higher than elsewhere in the map area, and the occurrence of dense arrays of fresh secondary craters produces a coarsely textured, hummocky surface at a scale of about 10–20km. The effect of roughness is highlighted by the low sun illumination angle. Ordinarily, rough terra material would be subdivided and mapped as individual ejecta blankets around and belonging to particular craters. In this eastern region, however, the closely grouped craters have about the same age, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been possible to distinguish the boundaries between their aprons in many places.|$|E
