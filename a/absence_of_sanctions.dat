The second section focuses on direct invectives (both unfiltered and mitigated) addressed to individual deputies or entire fractions.

40|$|Why would a {{sovereign}} government, immune from bankruptcy procedures and with few assets {{that could be}} seized {{in the event of}} a default, ever repay foreign creditors? And, correspondingly, why do foreign creditors lend to sovereigns? This paper finds general conditions under which, even in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanctions,</b> lending to sovereigns can emerge in a single shot game. Furthermore, it shows that positive borrowing can be sustained both in pooling and separating equilibria. In this way, it makes clear that neither sanctions nor reputation considerations, the two classical explanations, are necessary to enforce repayment. Information revelation is the crucial mechanism for these results. The repayment/default decision is interpreted as a signal used by the government to communicate information to domestic and foreign agents about the fundamentals of the economy. Governments repay to affect agents' expectations about them. A default, through its effect on expectations about fundamentals, can generate a decline in foreign and domestic investment and a credit crunch in domestic credit markets. Governments repay to avoid these costs, but may default (in equilibrium) when hit by a negative shock. ...|$|E

40|$|Punishment may deter antisocial behavior. Yet {{to punish}} is costly, {{and the costs}} often do not offset the gains that are due to {{elevated}} levels of cooperation. However, the effectiveness of punishment depends not only on how costly it is, {{but also on the}} circumstances defining the social dilemma. Using the snowdrift game as the basis, we have conducted a series of economic experiments to determine whether severe punishment is more effective than mild punishment. We have observed that severe punishment is not necessarily more effective, even if the cost of punishment is identical in both cases. The benefits of severe punishment become evident only under extremely adverse conditions, when to cooperate is highly improbable in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanctions.</b> If cooperation is likely, mild punishment is not less effective and leads to higher average payoffs, and is thus the much preferred alternative. Presented results suggest that the positive effects of punishment stem not only from imposed fines, but may also have a psychological background. Small fines can do wonders in motivating us to chose cooperation over defection, but without the paralyzing effect that may be brought about by large fines. The later should be utilized only when absolutely necessary. Comment: 15 pages, 6 figures; accepted for publication in PLoS ON...|$|E
40|$|The {{debate over}} the lack of {{correlation}} between CEO compensation and performance has caused a divide amongst corporate law scholars. Proponents of intervention have predictably welcomed the legislative activity and have called for more. This article argues that the legislative and regulatory interventions by the state are in furtherance of the expressive functions of the law, and {{that even in the}} <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanctions</b> such expressive laws can have an affect on behavior. It argues that while legislative and regulatory actions can express certain norms, they are ultimately unlikely to be of much help in behavior modification unless accompanied by norm internalization. Decentralized deployment of non-legal sanctions can offer a pathway to norm internalization in the CEO compensation area. Under this thesis, legislation only aids the deployment of social sanctions by virtue of its expressive function. This paper will briefly describe the expressive function of the law, and provides an overview of legislative attempts at serving this expressive function. It posits that expressive law cannot succeed in the absence of norm internalization by CEOs and directors. This process of internalization requires large shareholders to incur the costs of socializing the relevant actors by leveraging the structural attributes of the corporate law system...|$|E

That {{literature is}} devoted to map governments’ incentives for (non) compliance, but widely ignores the role of fiscal rule enforcement. This is remarkable, given {{the situation in the}} European Union, where we observe frequent breaches of the fiscal rules in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanctions.</b> This paper focuses therefore on the incentives of the European Commission as enforcer of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) and on how individual governments take these incentives into account. Based on actual cases and literature on international agreements we distinguish rationales which make the Commission lenient. Accordingly, we present a game theoretical model to map the interaction between the Commission and governments under incomplete information. We find that unforeseen fiscal needs stemming from crises or other contingencies enhance enforcement costs for the Commission. Given that crises require additional public expenditures, our model shows that some enforcement costs are welfare enhancing. We also find that governments have an incentive to emphasize the fiscal impact of crises to increase the Commission’s enforcement costs. Moreover, governments might even overstate crises’ fiscal impact to hide other expenditures. In doing so, governments exploit their informational advantage over their budget allocation and crisis solving costs. Finally, we provide examples related to Europe’s migrant crisis and national security to support our theoretical findings. nrpages: 25 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|By {{the spring}} of 1945, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union and France {{commenced}} {{the difficult task of}} restoring order to a continent that had witnessed unprecedented death and destruction {{at the hands of the}} Nazis. This task proved to be most arduous in post-Nazi Germany, where aerial bombings, mass rape and endemic hunger created inherently gendered experiences of defeat and occupation for a civilian population in which women largely outnumbered men. As the occupation took shape, the Soviet, British and American Military Governments granted German women in their Zones a relative degree of social and political agency by sanctioning women’s activities and organizations. The French Zone, on the other hand, one that has come to be known as the 'forgotten Zone' in postwar historiography, did not follow suit. The lack of French occupation policy toward German women disempowered them in the public sphere, where the failure of denazification and cultural imperialist policies and the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanctioned</b> women’s agencies stripped women of their agency altogether. Postwar depopulation anxieties and Gaullist ambitions of French ‘grandeur’ soon led to reforms in post-Liberation family and immigration policy, furthermore. Designed to reconstruct the ideal 'French race' along the lines of race, gender and nationalism, the French Zone became the base of a contentious repatriation program that radically subverted German motherhood. By charting the interaction between German women and French occupation policy- or often lack thereof- this dissertation charts the ways in which women under French occupation were socially and politically marginalized within the broader context of the other Allies’ occupations policies.

Using three separate indicators – the probability of undertaking a consolidation, {{the degree to which}} it is sustained, and the probability of exceeding a specified deficit limit – we search for structural breaks which could signify a change in the average level of fiscal discipline in these periods. We find increased discipline only up to 1997. Thereafter discipline erodes to the extent that, by 2005, there is less discipline than before the Maastricht process started. We conclude the new fiscal discipline was temporary; a product <b>of</b> the <b>sanction</b> <b>of</b> being denied entry to the Euro, and that EMU itself has had no impact on discipline (in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> that <b>sanction).</b> Our methodological innovation is to show the importance of the dynamics of fiscal behaviour: step dummies for changes in the average level of discipline, and trend dummies to capture any decline/increase relative to that average. A single structural break test will miss these dynamic effects, and may generate the erroneous conclusion that fiscal discipline had tightened since the start of phase two of EMU...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{evolution}} of European fiscal policies and the attempts at budgetary consolidation through three periods: the pre-Maastricht phase (to 1991); the run up to monetary union (1992 - 97), and finally the stability pact phase (1998 onwards). Using three separate indicators Ð the probability of undertaking a consolidation, {{the degree to which}} it is sustained, and the probability of exceeding a specified deficit limit Ð we search for structural breaks which could signify a change in the average level of fiscal discipline in these periods. We find increased discipline only up to 1997. Thereafter discipline erodes to the extent that, by 2005, there is less discipline than before the Maastricht process started.
