5|$|The Brønsted–Lowry {{theory is}} an <b>acid–base</b> <b>reaction</b> theory which was {{proposed}} independently by Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted and Thomas Martin Lowry in 1923.O {{acts as a}} base and gains H+ to become H3O+while the other acts as an acid and loses H+ to become OH−.|$|E
5|$|Like most amines, {{dopamine}} is {{an organic}} base. As a base, {{it is generally}} protonated in acidic environments (in an <b>acid-base</b> <b>reaction).</b> The protonated form is highly water-soluble and relatively stable, but can become oxidized if exposed to oxygen or other oxidants. In basic environments, dopamine is not protonated. In this free base form, it is less water-soluble and also more highly reactive. Because of the increased stability and water-solubility of the protonated form, dopamine is supplied for chemical or pharmaceutical use as dopamine hydrochloride—that is, the hydrochloride salt that is created when dopamine is combined with hydrochloric acid. In dry form, dopamine hydrochloride is a fine colorless powder.|$|E
5|$|Insoluble ionic {{compounds}} can be {{precipitated by}} mixing two solutions, {{one with the}} cation and one with the anion in it. Because all solutions are electrically neutral, the two solutions mixed must also contain counterions of the opposite charges. To ensure that these do not contaminate the precipitated ionic compound, {{it is important to}} ensure they do not also precipitate. If the two solutions have hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions as the counterions, they will react with one another in what is called an <b>acid–base</b> <b>reaction</b> or a neutralization reaction to form water. Alternately the counterions can be chosen to ensure that even when combined into a single solution they will remain soluble as spectator ions.|$|E

25|$|An acid–alkali {{reaction}} {{is a special}} case of an <b>acid–base</b> <b>reaction,</b> where the base used is also an alkali. When an acid reacts with an alkali salt (a metal hydroxide), the product is a metal salt and water. Acid–alkali reactions are also neutralization reactions.|$|E
25|$|The reverse {{reaction}} is possible, {{and thus the}} acid/base and conjugated base/acid are always in equilibrium. The equilibrium {{is determined by the}} acid and base dissociation constants (Ka and Kb) of the involved substances. A special case of the <b>acid-base</b> <b>reaction</b> is the neutralization where an acid and a base, taken at exactly same amounts, form a neutral salt.|$|E
25|$|An <b>acid–base</b> <b>reaction</b> is, thus, {{the removal}} of a {{hydrogen}} ion from the acid and its addition to the base. The removal of a hydrogen ion from an acid produces its conjugate base, which is the acid with a hydrogen ion removed. The reception of a proton by a base produces its conjugate acid, which is the base with a hydrogen ion added.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possibility}} is that {{only a portion of}} one molecule is transferred to the other molecule. This type of reaction occurs, for example, in redox and <b>acid-base</b> <b>reactions.</b> In redox reactions, the transferred particle is an electron, whereas in <b>acid-base</b> <b>reactions</b> it is a proton. This type of reaction is also called metathesis.|$|R

2500|$|The {{strength}} of an acid {{also depends on}} the solvent basicity (tendency to accept a proton), so that [...] acids which are strong in water may be weak in less basic solvents, and acids which are weak in water may be strong in more basic solvents. According to Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory, the acidity of an acid HA in a solvent S {{is due to the}} <b>acid-base</b> <b>reaction</b> [...] HA + S → A− + HS+.|$|E
2500|$|In the Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory, an <b>acid-base</b> <b>reaction</b> {{involves}} {{a transfer of}} protons (H+) from one species (the acid) to another (the base). When a proton is removed from an acid, the resulting species is termed that acid's conjugate base. When the proton is accepted by a base, the resulting species is termed that base's conjugate acid. In other words, acids act as proton donors and bases act as proton acceptors according to the following equation: ...|$|E
2500|$|An <b>acid–base</b> <b>reaction</b> is a {{chemical}} reaction that occurs between an acid and a base. Several theoretical frameworks provide alternative {{conceptions of the}} reaction mechanisms and their application in solving related problems; these are called the [...] acid–base theories, for example, Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory. Their importance becomes apparent in analyzing acid–base reactions for gaseous or liquid species, or when acid or base character may be somewhat less apparent. The first of these concepts {{was provided by the}} French chemist Antoine Lavoisier, around 1776.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{understand}} the mechanism of solid-state <b>acid-base</b> <b>reactions</b> and identify controlling factors for this type of reaction. The reactions between indomethacin and sodium bicarbonate, indomethacin and sodium carbonate, and flufenamic acid and magnesium oxide were investigated using X-ray powder diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry. Quantitative methods based on those techniques were established to characterize those solid-solid reactions. Surface migration followed by diffusion is proposed to be the possible mechanism, which is strongly supported by dependence of reactivity on particle size and mixing ratio. Relative humidity was identified to be very critical for <b>acid-base</b> <b>reactions.</b> This type of reaction will be very slow if both reactants can be kept dry. Different polymorphs and habits may have different reactivity. Solid-gas <b>acid-base</b> <b>reactions</b> with ammonia provided more clear understanding for the role of polymorphs. Accessibility of reaction groups may be very important for the stability. It was proposed that the <b>acid-base</b> <b>reactions</b> are initiated at defect sites. Residual amounts of amorphous content may be very critical, so a quantitative method for residual amorphous form was developed using parallel beam X-ray powder diffraction and whole pattern fitting. With lactose as a model system, the detection limit can reach 0. 37 % by the method developed. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{hydrogen}} {{requirement of}} Arrhenius and Brønsted–Lowry was removed by the Lewis definition of <b>acid–base</b> <b>reactions,</b> devised by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1923, {{in the same}} year as Brønsted–Lowry, but it was not elaborated by him until 1938. Instead of defining <b>acid–base</b> <b>reactions</b> in terms of protons or other bonded substances, the Lewis definition defines a base (referred to as a Lewis base) to be a compound that can donate an electron pair, and an acid (a Lewis acid) to be a compound that can receive this electron pair.|$|R
