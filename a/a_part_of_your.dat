Although wanting to remain faithful to the original versions of the songs covered, Patton wished to avoid simply mimicking the original recordings, stating [...] "this is a record of covers, and I believe firmly that you have to make them your own. There is a very fine line to tread. You have to treat a song with respect, yet twist it up, fuck it up and somehow make it <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> own voice".

500|$|Although many of Davidson's parishioners {{accepted}} that his London rescue mission was entirely honourable, some, including Major Hamond, were less convinced. Hamond was {{suspicious of the}} stream of visitors that Davidson brought to the Stiffkey rectory and thought he was neglecting his parochial duties. In 1927 {{relations between the two}} men worsened when Davidson, in a letter which Tucker describes as [...] "breathless in its rudeness and insensitivity", upbraided the major for clearing the ground in the Morston churchyard alongside his recently deceased wife's grave: [...] "Morston Churchyard is the private freehold property of the Rector of Morston... you have no possible right to interfere with it in any way without my permission any more than I have the right to come and annex <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> garden." [...] On one occasion, Davidson arrived late at Morston to officiate at a communion service, having forgotten the bread and wine; enraged, Hamond ordered him back to the rectory to collect it. An even greater lapse, in Hamond's eyes, was Davidson's failure to return to Stiffkey in time to officiate at the 1930 Armistice Day ceremony at the local war memorial.|$|E

He began {{looking for a new}} band to play with, having [...] "grown tired of Sacramento's coffeehouse circuit", and quickly attracted trumpet player Vince DiFiore, guitarist Greg Brown, bassist Shon Meckfessel and drummer Frank French. All were active in the music scene at the time; DiFiore notes that [...] " [...] came back and stole us from other bands". The band soon came up with the name [...] "Cake"; rather than referring to the foodstuff, the name is meant to be [...] "like when something insidiously becomes <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life... mean it more as something that cakes onto your shoe and is just sort of there until you get rid of it". McFessel soon left to attend college, and was replaced by Gabe Nelson. After touring and becoming part of the club scene in San Francisco, the band independently recorded and released Motorcade of Generosity in 1994, selling copies from their van as a method of paying touring expenses.|$|E
