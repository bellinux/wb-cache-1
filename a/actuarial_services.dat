40|$|The {{expenditures}} {{on health care}} in the new member countries from Central and Eastern Europe have never been based on the model of interdependence of socio-economic factors of the health state and the changes in the structure of population. The development of long-term scenarios here is based on the analysis of a previous study carried out within WPII “Health and Morbidity in the Accession Countries” and thus the health care expenditures are interrelated with the status of health of the nation. Like {{in the case of the}} other CEE countries included in the WPIX (Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) for the purpose of the scenarios calculations the model of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Financial and <b>Actuarial</b> <b>Service</b> was used. The main objective of this report is to describe the interrelations between these three groups of indicators related to the health care expenditure in Bulgaria for 2003 taken as a base year and further to produce a long-term projections up to 2050, using an intermediary control (target) year 2025. The outlined projections can be useful for the future health care and social policy in Bulgaria...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between audit and non-audit service fees paid to the statutory auditor by UK life insurance firms, utilising an extensive panel data sample set for the period 1999 - 2009. Consistent with a knowledge spill over (impairment of independence) hypothesis, we predict and find that audit fees are positively (negatively) associated with <b>actuarial</b> (tax <b>service)</b> fees. Additionally, our results indicate that regulatory changes enforced after 2004 deterred UK life insurance firms from purchasing non-audit services that are perceived to impair auditor independence. Finally, we find evidence concerning the inter-temporal determination of audit fees...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{analyzes the}} structure {{of the health care system}} in Colombia with the aim of establishing the magnitude of the public fiscal deficit generated by such a system. We first explain its complex funding structure (full of “cross-subsidies”) and then we run simulations to establish the public sector financial gap. Based on these results we compute the Net Present Value (NPV) of the health care <b>service’s</b> (<b>actuarial)</b> liability, as the system increases coverage from the current 86 % to the recently announced target of universal coverage by year 2012. Our base-case scenario shows an estimate of a NPV of public liabilities of about 97 % of GDP (of year 2007) over the period 2007 - 2050, which is of similar magnitude to the pension system liability established after recent “parametric reforms ” to the Pay-as-you-go System...|$|R
40|$|Predictive {{analysis}} include techniques fromdata mining that analyze {{current and}} historical data and make {{predictions about the}} future. Predictive analytics is used in <b>actuarial</b> science, financial <b>services,</b> retail, travel, healthcare, insurance, pharmaceuticals, marketing, telecommunications and other fields. Predicting patterns {{can be considered as}} a classification problem and combining the different classifiers gives better results. We will study and compare three methods used to combine multiple classifiers. Bayesian networks perform classification based on conditional probability. It is ineffective and easy to interpret as it assumes that the predictors are independent. Tree augmented naïve Bayes (TAN) constructs a maximum weighted spanning tree that maximizes the likelihood of the training data, to perform classification. This tree structure eliminates the independent attribute assumption of naïve Bayesian networks. Behavior-knowledge space method works in two phases and can provide very good performances if large and representative data sets are available...|$|R

50|$|Wendell Milliman (1905-1976) was {{a founder}} of Milliman, Inc., {{formerly}} Milliman & Robertson, {{one of the largest}} actuarial and business consulting firms in the world. Starting as the Pacific Northwest’s only independent consulting actuary in a small two-room Seattle office in 1947, Milliman co-founded, with Stuart Robertson, a company that grew to encompass offices across the nation, first on the West Coast, then in Milwaukee, and then in more than 30 locations throughout the country. It also has offices in 16 countries across the globe. Based on a profit-sharing model that brings together independent consultants under a common corporate banner, Milliman, Inc. looked for and found new opportunities to provide <b>actuarial</b> <b>services</b> to insurers and pension planners as the United States dramatically changed and its economy grew during the post-World War II years.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Hewitt Associates {{established}} its first {{office in the}} UK (based in Hemel Hempstead) under its own name, after joint ventures with various insurance-led consultancies broke down, and thus began its expansion abroad, offering compensation consulting, <b>actuarial</b> <b>services</b> and tailored benefit programs particularly to US corporations in the United Kingdom. Its UK growth was rapid {{on the back of}} 'Big-Bang' and the expansion of US technology and services companies into the UK/Europe market. Hewitt pioneered flexible benefits in the UK. Within 3 years it has also established offices in Paris, the Netherlands and Germany with the UK acting as European headquarters. In the late 1980s it merged with Bacon & Woodrow (actuaries) in the UK. The firm had brought in more than $250 million in revenues for 1990 and was ranked the fourth largest benefit management and consulting firm in the world, according to Business Insurance magazine. Yet many of Hewitt's clients were feeling the pinch of a struggling economy and inflation. As companies began looking for ways to bolster the bottom line, benefits were often the first place executives looked for a quick fix. In a time when few received raises and those who did received only cost-of-living increases, Hewitt started retooling retirement packages and healthcare benefits to keep its customers from making drastic changes. Of particular interest were retirement programs since few seniors could withstand the effects of inflation and soaring healthcare costs. Hewitt also researched other benefit additions such as flextime scheduling, child- and elder-care benefits, and HMOs (health management organizations) versus PPOs (preferred provider organizations).|$|E
40|$|The {{financial}} economics {{literature suggests that}} {{the extent to which}} surrogate monitors such as actuaries are employed by owners of the firm depends upon organizationspecific factors such as size and ownership structure. Using 1991 - 1993 data drawn from New Zealand's life insurance industry, an empirical examination is conducted to see whether the demand for <b>actuarial</b> <b>services</b> is distinguished by the characteristics of life insurance firms. The empirical results indicate that, consistent with expectations, expenditure on <b>actuarial</b> <b>services</b> was positively associated with large and multiproduct firms and those with high underwriting risk. However, organizational form and the substitutive effects of auditing on actuarial costs, were found not to be statistically significant. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the recent}} past, concerted {{efforts have been}} made to {{encourage}} financial service access to the poor starting with microfinance and subsequently micro-insurance. With complexity of insurance and the vulnerability of the target market, there are inherent risks that insurance companies face in serving the low-end market. This study documents these risks, discusses the strategies that Kenyan insurance companies are using to mitigate the risks and discerns creative strategies to minimize them. Purposive sampling was used to select 8 companies that offer micro-insurance products in Kenya, from which 49 key informants responded to the survey. Visual binning approach was used to describe the data, while statistical tests of correlation and association were carried out by use of Pearson Correlations and Chi-Square tests. The study singled out the most ubiquitous risks facing micro-insurance providers as; diseconomies of scale resulting from low penetration, limited distribution channels, correlation risks and rigid regulatory framework. The strategies being used to counter the risks include; use of technology to lower administration costs, control of moral hazard and adverse selection, thorough scrutiny of claims, development of risk measurement models and continuous monitoring of the clients. Micro-insurance service providers are advised to invest in research and <b>actuarial</b> <b>services</b> to improve pricing of the products, develop innovative distribution channels, adopt technology conscious partnerships and devise flexible premium payment terms to enhance control o...|$|E
