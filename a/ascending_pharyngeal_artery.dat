5|$|Many nocturnal {{species have}} large, {{independently}} movable ears, {{although there are}} significant differences in sizes and shapes of the ear between species. The structure of the middle and inner ear of strepsirrhines differs between the lemurs and lorisoids. In lemurs, the tympanic cavity, which surrounds the middle ear, is expanded. This leaves the ectotympanic ring, which supports the eardrum, free within the auditory bulla. This trait is also seen in adapiforms. In lorisoids, however, the tympanic cavity is smaller and the ectotympanic ring becomes attached {{to the edge of}} the auditory bulla. The tympanic cavity in lorisoids also has two accessory air spaces, which are not present in lemurs. Both lorisoids and cheirogaleid lemurs have replaced the internal carotid artery with an enlarged <b>ascending</b> <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>artery.</b> Strepsirrhines also possess distinctive features in their tarsus (ankle bones) that differentiate them from haplorhines, such as a sloping talo-fibular facet (the face where the talus bone and fibula meet) and a difference in the location of the position of the flexor fibularis tendon on the talus. These differences give strepsirrhines the ability to make more complex rotations of the ankle and indicate that their feet are habitually inverted, or turned inward, an adaptation for grasping vertical supports.|$|E

40|$|Background: The jugular foramen, {{the bony}} opening {{on the base}} of skull, is an opening through which pass the ninth, tenth, and {{eleventh}} cranial nerves, two dural sinuses, and the meningeal branches of the occipital and <b>ascending</b> <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>arteries.</b> The increasing use of modern diagnostic procedures and new surgical approaches has created a need for much more detailed anatomical studies and explanations. This article reveals some additional features. Material and Methods: 324 jugular foramina of skulls of persons of unknown age and gender were examined. The morphological characteristics of all the investigated jugular foramina were described, measured, and compared, taking into consideration their side. Results: Jugular foramina were studied for a review of its morphology, morphometry and its comparison with previous studies. Different shapes and sizes of jugular foramen were seen. Laterality was also noticed, compartmentation was also observed which was found to be statistically significant. Conclusions: A detailed examination of the jugular foramen anatomy was performed. The main types of jugular foramina and the frequencies of bipartite or tripartite division were established. Several dimensions of the parts of the jugular foramen were measured.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A recent {{randomized}} {{clinical trial}} on intracranial atherosclerosis was discontinued {{because of the}} higher frequency of stroke and death in the angioplasty and stent placement group than in the medical treatment group. An in-depth under-standing {{of the relationship between}} biologic responses and flowdynamics is still required to identify the current limitations of intracranial stent placement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five Wingspan stents were deployed in tapered swine <b>ascending</b> <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>arteries.</b> Temporal wall shear stress distributions and in-stent stenosis were evaluated at days 0, 7, 14, and 28 after stent placement. The physiologic role of wall shear stress was analyzed regarding its correlation with in-stent stenosis. RESULTS: In-stent stenosis reached a peak of nearly 40 % at day 14 and decreased mainly at the distal stent segment until day 28. The wall shear stress demonstrated a characteristic pattern with time {{on the basis of the}} in-stent stenosis change. The wall shear stress gradient increased from the proximal to distal segment until day 14. At day 28, the trend was reversed dramatically, decreasing from the proximal to the distal segment. A significant correlation between the in-stent stenosis growth until day 14 and low wall shear stress values just after stent placement was detected. In-stent stenosis regression between days 14 and 28 was also associated with the high wall shear stress values at day 14. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the physiologic wall shear stress can control the biphasic in-stent stenosis change in tapere...|$|R
40|$|R. Jahan BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{extended}} {{time window}} and theoretic reduction in hemorrhage make mechanical strategies an attractive {{approach in the}} treatment of patients with ischemic stroke. My purpose was to evaluate the recanalization efficacy and safety of the Solitaire FR Revascularization Device in a swine vessel occlusion model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For recanalization efficacy, radio-opaque clots were used in 6 <b>ascending</b> <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>arteries</b> of the swine. Safety was assessed in 8 renal arteries with 3 passes of the device. Four vessels were harvested at 30 days, and 4, at 90 days, with microscopic examination to assess vessel damage. RESULTS: On deployment, immediate flow was seen in 3 / 6 vessels; and on retrieval, TIMI- 3 recana-lization was seen in 6 / 6. Vasospasm, which resolved on follow-up angiography with no distal emboli or vessel damage, was noted. In the renal vessels, safety evaluation findings were unremarkable, with the exception of 2 vessels harvested from a kidney at 90 days. These 2 vessels appeared without damage on microscopy; however, angiography showed shrinkage of the entire kidney, which was attributed to damage and stenosis of the main renal artery {{at the site of the}} guide-catheter insertion, likely leading to a chronic low-flow state and resultant atrophy of the entire kidney. CONCLUSIONS: The Solitaire Device showed good recanalization efficacy with acceptable safety. The unique stent-like design allows immediate flow restoration, a distinct advantage of the device. On the basis of this study, the device has good potential as a tool {{in the treatment of}} patients with ischemic stroke.

40|$|The thyroid and thymic arteries were {{investigated}} in 30 male and 30 female Hartley guinea pigs. The {{superior thyroid artery}} {{was the most common}} (73 % of males, 55 % of females). It arose from the external carotid artery and gave rise to the superior and inferior laryngeal arteries in addition to glandular rami. In the remaining instances, the independence of the superior laryngeal resulted in the presence of middle and inferior thyroid arteries. The middle thyroid artery, arising from the external carotid or distal half of the common carotid artery, passed the thyroid gland cranially or penetrated it to terminate in the inferior laryngeal artery. The inferior thyroid artery, arising from the distal or proximal half of the common carotid, reached the gland caudally also to end in the inferior laryngeal. A thyroid ima artery was rare. There were many 'independent thyroid arteries'. Some of them arose from the lingual and the <b>ascending</b> <b>pharyngeal</b> <b>arteries,</b> suggesting that they were the original thyroid arteries. Thus the thyroid arteries were much more abundant and variable in the guinea pig than in man. The arteries supplying the 'superficial cervical thymus', which is characteristic of this animal, were the superior and inferior superficial cervical thymic arteries. The latter artery, arising from the superficial cervical, appeared in about 30 % of the specimens. The former was always present and arose from the lingual (75 % of males, 67 % of females); superior laryngeal, and superior thyroid or common carotid arteries.
