Broader {{spatial and temporal}} scales, and multiple stressor integration are appropriately being considered more frequently in all risk assessment activities. This expansion and integration is essential for coastal risk assessment. Because coastal assess-ments must deal with co-occurrence of several candidate stressors manifesting within broad spa-tial and temporal scales, wider use of formal methods for assessing causal linkages is needed. Simple Bayesian inference techniques are dis-cussed here to demonstrate their utility in quan-tifying the belief warranted by available information.

40|$|Land snails are an {{important}} yet often neglected component of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s biological diversity. Despite high levels of diversity within this group and the identification of many narrow range endemic species as being of conservation concern, {{there have been few}} detailed studies that document the ecology and conservation requirements of the group.

Whilst factors such as land clearing are readily apparent and have resulted in extinctions, other threats such as climate change are not well understood.
