40|$|AbstractInternship {{is a good}} {{program for}} the {{students}} to experience the real industry environment in <b>advance</b> before <b>graduation</b> and it is also good to excite them to study harder. But, during the period of internship, {{it is not easy to}} check the progress and status of each student by the supervising professor periodically. In addition, relatively short period of internship is another problem {{for the students to}} experience real design problems in the industry field. Capstone design is another good program for the students to experience the entire process of engineering design but to find the proper real field problems annually is not easy for the university. To solve these problems and enhance the university-industry collaboration, a novel program named as Internship & Capstone Design Integrated program (ICIP) is developed by Dongguk University in Korea. In this paper, the detailed information of ICIP including the management process is introduced and the effect of ICIP is analyzed using the case studies...|$|R

40|$|Asset?based {{approaches}} – usually involving asset transfers and/or asset building – {{are increasingly}} central {{to thinking about}} poverty alleviation, social protection, graduation and livelihood resilience. Although the notion of assets is well established in the literature, the meanings of and relationships between asset(s), livelihood capital(s), risks(s), welfare and wellbeing, and graduation need further analysis. We examine issues arising from asset?based approaches to poverty reduction and introduce the idea of ‘asset?ness’ – the qualities and characteristics of different assets – which have received little attention from those promoting or designing asset?based social protection programmes. We argue that asset?ness provides a key to understanding differences in the impacts of asset?based social protection and associated processes and dynamics of graduation. As such the article aims to <b>advance</b> understanding of <b>graduation</b> theory. We develop this argument with reference to domestic livestock, which are commonly distributed to poor people as part of asset?based poverty alleviation and social protection programmes...|$|R

His first assignment after the Infantry Officer Basic Course was as Executive Officer of an Officer Candidate School company at Fort Benning. In 1965 {{he was assigned to}} Fort Kobbe, Panama. He deployed to Vietnam in 1967, eventually commanding a company, and upon return to the United States he attended the Infantry Officer <b>Advanced</b> Course. After <b>graduation,</b> he was assigned as a tactics instructor at the United States Military Academy, then returned to Vietnam in 1972 as a Plans Officer for Military Assistance Command, Vietnam. He attended the United States Marine Corps Command and Staff College from 1973 to 1974, then proceeded to Fort Riley, where he served in various staff positions with the 1st Infantry Division. In April 1978, he was given command of the 193rd Infantry Brigade. Following his assignment in Panama, he attended the United States Army War College at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, and then served at the War Plans Division in Washington D.C., where he eventually became Chief. He was next assigned as Executive Officer at the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, before taking command of another brigade, the 197th Infantry Brigade at Fort Benning. After serving from 1987 to 1989 as the Assistant Commandant of the United States Army Infantry School, he returned to Panama for a third time as the J-3, United States Southern Command, a position he held during Operation Just Cause. He took command of United States Army South in 1990, and followed that command in 1991 with command of the 1st Infantry Division.

40|$|CONTEXT: In Brazil, obstetricians and gynecologists are not {{required}} to submit to periodical evaluations to ascertain their professional competence in dealing with new concepts and therapies. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of a group of obstetricians and gynecologists on a written evidence-based obstetrics test and determine their opinions and use of systematic reviews. TYPE OF STUDY: Prospective cohort. SETTING: Brazilian Obstetrics and Gynecology Congress 2001. METHODS: 230 doctors {{agreed to participate in the}} study during a national obstetrics and gynecology congress. Participants took an individual anonymous written multiple-choice test with seven questions on clinical obstetrics, one question on the interpretation of a meta-analysis graph and two questions on their opinions and actual use of systematic reviews. Scores were analyzed and compared after grouping the participants according to year of graduation, residence training, doctoral program and faculty status. RESULTS: The general average score was 49. 2 ± 17. 4. The scores tended to decline as the years since <b>graduation</b> <b>advanced.</b> Doctors who graduated in the last five years had higher scores than those who graduated over 25 years ago (52. 2 versus 42. 9). The performance did not vary according to medical residence, postgraduate program or teaching status. While 98. 2 % considered systematic reviews relevant, only 54. 9 % said that they routinely used this source of information. DISCUSSION: The participants' average score was low, even though they were highly qualified and trained. Despite the limitations of the study, the results are worrisome. If motivated physicians participating in a national congress obtained such low scores, we can speculate that the results might be even worse among other doctors that do not attend these events. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Brazilian obstetricians and gynecologists could benefit from continuing medical education and raise questions about the recycling methods currently available...|$|R
