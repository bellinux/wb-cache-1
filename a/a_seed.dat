5|$|Unlike {{in higher}} animals, where {{parthenogenesis}} is rare, asexual reproduction may occur in plants by several different mechanisms. The formation of stem tubers in potato is one example. Particularly in arctic or alpine habitats, where opportunities for fertilisation of flowers by animals are rare, plantlets or bulbs, may develop instead of flowers, replacing sexual reproduction with asexual reproduction and {{giving rise to}} clonal populations genetically identical to the parent. This {{is one of several}} types of apomixis that occur in plants. Apomixis can also happen in <b>a</b> <b>seed,</b> producing <b>a</b> <b>seed</b> that contains an embryo genetically identical to the parent.|$|E
5|$|Cowpeas seeds {{provide a}} rich source of {{proteins}} and calories, as well as minerals and vitamins. This complements the mainly cereal diet in countries that grow cowpeas as a major food crop. <b>A</b> <b>seed</b> can consist of 25% protein and has very low fat content. Cowpea starch is digested more slowly than the starch from cereals, which is more beneficial to human health. The grain is {{a rich source}} of folic acid, an important vitamin that helps prevent neural tube defects in unborn babies.|$|E

5|$|The Schenectady group {{improved}} on the anvils {{designed by}} Percy Bridgman, {{who received a}} Nobel Prize {{for his work in}} 1946. Bundy and Strong made the first improvements, then more were made by Hall. The GE team used tungsten carbide anvils within a hydraulic press to squeeze the carbonaceous sample held in a catlinite container, the finished grit being squeezed out of the container into a gasket. The team recorded diamond synthesis on one occasion, but the experiment could not be reproduced because of uncertain synthesis conditions, and the diamond was later shown to have been a natural diamond used as <b>a</b> <b>seed.</b>|$|E
5|$|TumbleSeed {{begins in}} a quiet forest village {{disturbed}} by angry creatures creating holes in the ground. <b>A</b> <b>seed</b> is tasked to fulfill a vague prophecy by ascending the mountain, progressing through the forest, jungle, desert, and snow, to save the town. The player controls an ascending, horizontal, and slanted vine to balance a rolling seed past procedurally generated holes and enemy obstacles {{to reach the top}} of a mountain. With a controller, the player uses two analog sticks to raise and lower the two edges of the horizontal vine while managing the momentum of the seed. If the seed falls into a hole or hits an enemy, the player loses a life ("heart") and resumes from an earlier position, but the game ends once the player runs out of hearts. Some punishments are more severe: <b>A</b> <b>seed</b> that fall into a hole will resume from the last flagged checkpoint, but if the seed collides with spikes or loses all hearts, the game ends and the player returns {{to the bottom of the}} mountain to try again.|$|E

Over 2000 principals, educators and school counselors have attended screenings within Israel's religious school system. The film has now been seen by an estimated 8 million people worldwide. Following the success of Trembling before G-d, DuBowski produced a documentary about gay devout Muslims entitled A Jihad for Love.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{and other}} {{invertebrates}} {{are a major}} portion of the nuthatch diet, especially during the breeding season, when they rely almost exclusively on live prey, but most species also eat seeds during the winter, when invertebrates are less readily available. Larger food items, such as big insects, snails, acorns or seeds may be wedged into cracks and pounded with the bird's strong bill. Unusually for a bird, the brown-headed nuthatch uses a piece of tree bark as a lever to pry up other bark flakes to look for food; the bark tool may then be carried from tree to tree or used to cover <b>a</b> <b>seed</b> cache.|$|E

Plants can live for over 60 years.|$|E
5|$|The Han-era Chinese used {{bronze and}} iron {{to make a}} range of weapons, culinary tools, carpenters' tools and {{domestic}} wares. A significant product of these improved iron-smelting techniques was the manufacture of new agricultural tools. The three-legged iron seed drill, invented by the 2nd century BC, enabled farmers to carefully plant crops in rows instead of casting seeds out by hand. The heavy moldboard iron plow, also invented during the Han dynasty, required only one man to control it, two oxen to pull it. It had three plowshares, <b>a</b> <b>seed</b> box for the drills, a tool which turned down the soil and could sow roughly 45,730 m2 (11.3 acres) of land in a single day.|$|E
5|$|The capitol grounds cover three {{city blocks}} and include Willson and Capitol parks. Near the west {{entrance}} of the capitol is a replica of Philadelphia's Liberty Bell.

Throughout the grounds are native trees and shrubs, including blue spruce, Oregon-grape (the state flower), giant sequoia, coast redwood, Japanese maple, dogwood species, Bradford pear, cherry tree species, English holly, rhododendron, and magnolia tree species.

5|$|Welsh Quakers, Baptists and Methodists {{settled in}} the Welsh Tract of Pennsylvania. While some Welsh colonists like Roger Williams, left to found Rhode Island, Anne Hutchinson founded <b>a</b> <b>seed</b> {{settlement}} in New York. Rhode Island was not initially counted as part of New England, having been excluded from the New England Confederation, but later joined the Dominion of New England. Thus, {{the definition of the}} Middle Colonies sometimes changed and overlapped with Rhode Island's colonial boundaries. After joining the Dominion of New England, however, Rhode Island was permanently thought of as a New England colony. New York's initial possession of parts of Maine ensured a close relationship with other New England colonies like Vermont and a continuing New England influence in the colony.|$|E
5|$|With {{some notable}} exceptions, Reformed Christians baptize infants who {{are born to}} believing parents. Reformed Christians do so {{on the basis of}} the {{continuity}} from the old covenant between God and Israel and the new covenant with the church, since infants were circumcised under the old covenant. They also see God's saving purpose in the new covenant as having to do with families as well as individuals. Because Reformed Christians believe baptism must be embraced by faith to have any benefit, they recognize that faith may come later in life rather than preceding baptism. Infants may also be said to possess <b>a</b> <b>seed</b> of faith which will come to fruition later, or baptism may be administered based on a promise of faith offered by their sponsors (usually their parents) which will be kept at a later age.|$|E
