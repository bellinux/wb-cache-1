5|$|The Duke {{was based}} on the BR Standard Class 7 Britannia design. It {{incorporated}} three sets of modified Caprotti valve gear, relatively new to British locomotive engineering and more efficient than Walschaerts or Stephenson valve gear. The Duke was regarded as a failure by locomotive crews due to its poor steaming characteristics and its heavy fuel consumption. Trials undertaken by British Railways also returned negative feedback, reporting problems with the poor draughting of the locomotive which resulted in difficulty <b>adhering</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> timetables.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the first millennium, the Hoysalas gained power in the region. Literature flourished during this time, which led to the {{emergence}} of distinctive Kannada literary metres, and the construction of temples and sculptures <b>adhering</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Vesara style of architecture. The expansion of the Hoysala Empire brought minor parts of modern Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu under its rule. In the early 14th century, Harihara and Bukka Raya established the Vijayanagara empire with its capital, Hosapattana (later named Vijayanagara), {{on the banks of the}} Tungabhadra River in the modern Bellary district. The empire rose as a bulwark against Muslim advances into South India, which it completely controlled for over two centuries.|$|E

5|$|Galileo {{proposed}} that a falling body would fall with a uniform acceleration, {{as long as}} the resistance of the medium through which it was falling remained negligible, or in the limiting case of its falling through a vacuum. He also derived the correct kinematical law for the distance travelled during a uniform acceleration starting from rest—namely, that it is proportional to the square of the elapsed time (d∝t2). Prior to Galileo, Nicole Oresme, in the 14th century, had derived the times-squared law for uniformly accelerated change, and Domingo de Soto had suggested in the 16th century that bodies falling through a homogeneous medium would be uniformly accelerated. Galileo expressed the time-squared law using geometrical constructions and mathematically precise words, <b>adhering</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> standards of the day. (It remained for others to re-express the law in algebraic terms).|$|E
5|$|Geastrum triplex may be {{confused}} with G.saccatum or G.fimbriatum, as the rays do not always crack around the perimeter to form a bowl under the spore case. However, it is larger than either of these species. The combination of characteristics which distinguish G.triplex from other earthstars include the lack of debris <b>adhering</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outer surfaces, the saucer-like base in which the spore case is seated, the relatively large size, the fibrillose peristome and the paler area surrounding the peristome separating it {{from the rest of}} the endoperidium. Unlike some other Geastrum species, the rays of G.triplex are not hygroscopic: they do not open and close in response to changes in humidity.|$|E
5|$|In road {{snow and}} ice control, brine is often used as an anti-icer rather than a de-icer. A vehicle carries a tank of brine, which is sprayed on the road surface before or {{at the onset of}} the storm. This keeps {{snow and ice}} from <b>adhering</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface and makes {{mechanical}} removal by plows easier. Solid salt is also wetted with brine or other liquid deicer. This speeds de-icing action and helps keep it from bouncing off the pavement into the gutter or ditch. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The brine is also more environmentally friendly, as less salt is required to treat the same length of road.|$|E

5|$|Monastic reform {{became an}} {{important}} issue during the 11th century, as elites began to worry that monks were not <b>adhering</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rules binding them to a strictly religious life. Cluny Abbey, founded in the Mâcon region of France in 909, was established {{as part of the}} Cluniac Reforms, a larger movement of monastic reform in response to this fear. Cluny quickly established a reputation for austerity and rigour. It sought to maintain a high quality of spiritual life by placing itself under the protection of the papacy and by electing its own abbot without interference from laymen, thus maintaining economic and political independence from local lords.|$|E
5|$|Roguelike games create random tile-based levels, monster encounters, and {{treasure}} through procedural generation on each new game. Preferably roguelikes <b>adhering</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Berlin Interpretation use ASCII-based graphics. They may include pre-determined levels as well, {{such as a}} town level common to the Moria family where the player can buy and sell equipment. Generated layouts typically incorporate rooms connected by corridors, {{some of which may}} be preset to some degree (e.g., monster lairs or treasuries). Open areas or natural features, such as rivers, may occur, though these are considered against the Berlin Interpretation. While early roguelikes would have levels confined to the bounds of the terminal screen, other roguelikes enabled a much larger level size, only a portion shown to the player as they moved around it.|$|E
5|$|Some scutes {{contain a}} single pore {{known as an}} {{integumentary}} sense organ. Crocodiles and gharials have these on large parts of their bodies, while alligators and caimans only have them on the head. Their exact function is not fully understood, {{but it has been}} suggested that they may be mechanosensory organs. Another possibility is that they may produce an oily secretion that prevents mud from <b>adhering</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> skin. There are prominent paired integumentary glands in skin folds on the throat, and others in the side walls of the cloaca. Various functions for these have been suggested. They may play a part in communication, as indirect evidence suggest that they secrete pheromones used in courtship or nesting. The skin of crocodilians is tough and can withstand damage from conspecifics, and the immune system is effective enough to heal wounds within a few days.|$|E

5|$|Formal end-of-year {{examinations}} commence {{starting in}} Year 4 to dictate class streaming {{arrangements for the}} following year. Students are examined in English, Maltese, mathematics, religion and social studies. Despite the fact that eleven-plus examinations highlight inequality and failures, and are recognized as ineffective educational tools by experts, Malta still implements such exams. In Year 6, when most pupils have turned eleven years of age, an eleven-plus exam is given to students to determine which students attend which secondary schools. Students are tested in English language, Maltese language, mathematics, social studies and religion; the latter is optional for those not <b>adhering</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> faith taught in schools. While 73 per cent of eleven-year-old students sat the eleven-plus exam in 2001, only about 54 percent pass it each year. Students achieving success in the eleven-plus exam go on to attend prestigious 'junior lyceums' during their secondary years, whilst {{those who do not}} attend 'area secondary schools'.

5|$|Germany {{launched}} an offensive against France and, <b>adhering</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Manstein Plan also attacked the neutral nations of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg on 10 May 1940. That same day British forces landed in Iceland and the Faroes to preempt a possible German {{invasion of the}} islands. The U.S., in close co-operation with the Danish envoy to Washington D.C., agreed to protect Greenland, laying the political framework for the formal establishment of bases in April 1941. The Netherlands and Belgium were overrun using blitzkrieg tactics {{in a few days}} and weeks, respectively. The French-fortified Maginot Line and {{the main body of the}} Allied forces which had moved into Belgium were circumvented by a flanking movement through the thickly wooded Ardennes region, mistakenly perceived by Allied planners as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles. As a result, the bulk of the Allied armies found themselves trapped in an encirclement and were beaten. The majority were taken prisoner, whilst over 300,000, mostly British and French, were evacuated from the continent at Dunkirk by early June, although abandoning almost all of their equipment.|$|E

5|$|Krueger flap and Natural Laminar Flow Insect Mitigation Test Program – Boeing {{commenced}} {{a series}} of test flights on 17 March 2015 with a modified Boeing 757, incorporating new wing-leading-edge sections and an actively blown vertical tail. The left wing has been modified to include a 6.7 m-span glove section supporting a variable-camber Krueger flap which will be deployed during landing and which protrudes {{just ahead of the}} leading edge. Although Krueger flaps have been tried before as insect-mitigation screens, previous designs caused additional drag; the newer design being tested is variable-camber and designed to retract as seamlessly as possible into the lower wing surface. Increasing the use of natural laminar flow (NLF) on an aircraft wing has the potential to improve fuel burn by as much as 15%, but even small contaminants from insect remains will trip the flow from laminar to turbulent, destroying the performance benefit. The test flights have been supported by the European airline group TUI AG and conducted jointly with NASA as part of the agency’s Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) program. While the left wing tests the Kreuger flaps, the right wing is being used to test coatings that prevent insects from <b>adhering</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wing. Success here will {{open the door to the}} application of Natural Laminar Flow to reduce fuel burn.|$|E

5|$|The {{practice}} of marking sacred areas began in Japan {{as early as}} the Yayoi period (from about 500BC to 300AD) originating from primal religious beliefs. Features in the landscape such as rocks, waterfalls, islands, and especially mountains, were places believed to be capable of attracting kami, and subsequently were worshiped as yorishiro. Originally, sacred places may have been simply marked with a surrounding fence and an entrance gate or torii. Later, temporary structures similar to present day portable shrines were constructed to welcome the gods to the sacred place, which eventually evolved into permanent buildings that were dedicated to the gods. Ancient shrines were constructed according to the style of dwellings (Izumo Taisha) or storehouses (Ise Grand Shrine). The buildings had gabled roofs, raised floors, plank walls, and were thatched with reed or covered with hinoki cypress bark. Such early shrines did not include a space for worship. Three important forms of ancient shrine architectural styles exist: taisha-zukuri, shinmei-zukuri and sumiyoshi-zukuri. They are exemplified by Izumo Taisha, Nishina Shinmei Shrine and Sumiyoshi Taisha, respectively, and date from before 552AD. According to the tradition of , the buildings or shrines were faithfully rebuilt at regular intervals <b>adhering</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original design.
