40|$|We {{calculate}} {{the present value}} of state pension liabilities under existing policies, and separately under policy changes that would affect pension payouts including cost of living adjustments (COLAs), retirement ages, and buyout schedules for early retirement. Liabilities if plans were frozen as of June 2009 would be $ 3. 2 trillion if capitalized using taxable municipal curves, which credit states for a possibility of default in the same states of the world as general obligation debt, and $ 4. 4 trillion using the <b>Treasury</b> curve. <b>Under</b> the typical actuarial method of recognizing future service and wage increases, liabilities are $ 3. 6 trillion and $ 5. 2 trillion using municipal curves and Treasury curves respectively. Compared to $ 1. 8 trillion in pension fund assets, the baseline level of unfunded liabilities is therefore around $ 3 trillion <b>under</b> <b>Treasury</b> rates. A one percentage point reduction in COLAs would reduce total liabilities by 9 ‐ 11 %, implementing actuarially fair early retirement could reduce them by 2 ‐ 5 %, and raising the retirement age by one year would reduce them by 2 ‐ 4 %. Even relatively dramatic policy changes, such as the elimination of COLAs or the implementation of Social Security retirement age parameters, would leave liabilities around $ 1. 5 trillion more than plan <b>assets</b> <b>under</b> <b>Treasury</b> discounting. This suggests that taxpayers will bear the lion's share of the costs associated with the legacy liabilities of state DB pension plans. ...|$|R
50|$|Most {{banks have}} whole {{departments}} devoted to <b>treasury</b> <b>management</b> and supporting their clients' needs in this area. Until recently, large banks had the stronghold on {{the provision of}} <b>treasury</b> <b>management</b> products and services. However, smaller banks are increasingly launching and/or expanding their <b>treasury</b> <b>management</b> functions and offerings, because of the market opportunity afforded by the recent economic environment (with banks of all sizes focusing on the clients they serve best), availability of (recently displaced) highly seasoned <b>treasury</b> <b>management</b> professionals, access to industry standard, third-party technology providers' products and services tiered according {{to the needs of}} smaller clients, and investment in education and other best practices. A number of independent <b>treasury</b> <b>management</b> systems (TMS) are available, allowing enterprises to conduct <b>treasury</b> <b>management</b> internally.

40|$|Current {{management}} science models fail to adequately recognize that <b>treasury</b> <b>management</b> related to check payments has largely become an information management activity. Check processing operations lack {{the flexibility to}} capture information {{which can be used}} by treasury managers to make the most effective utilization of check-related funds. This argument is developed by examining the fit between {{management science}} models and check processing practice in the U. S. banking industry, {{as well as at the}} Federal Reserve Bank, in view of the changes that information technology has wrought and the problems it has the potential to solve. We critique models for inbound and outbound check processing and <b>treasury</b> <b>management</b> for checks, and conclude that models which link check processing and <b>treasury</b> <b>management</b> models hold out significant promise for improving management control. ...|$|R
