50|$|Due to the {{combination}} of refractory properties, high thermal conductivity, and the advantages of large stoichiometric boron content outlined in the above discussion of integral neutron <b>absorbing</b> fuel <b>pellet</b> cladding, refractory diborides {{have been used as}} control rod materials and have been studied for use in space nuclear power applications. While boron carbide is the most popular material for fast breeder reactors due to its lack of expense, extreme hardness comparable to diamond, and high cross-section, it completely disintegrates after a 5% burnup and is reactive when in contact with refractory metals. Hafnium diboride also suffers from high susceptibility to material degradation with boron transmutation, but its high melting point of 3380 °C and the large thermal neutron capture cross section of hafnium of 113 barns and low reactivity with refractory metals such as tungsten makes it an attractive control rod material when clad with a refractory metal.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Two {{integrated}} core / scrape-off-layer (SOL) / divertor transport codes TOPICS-IB and JINTRAC {{with links}} to MHD stability codes have been coupled with models of pellet injection to clarify effects of pellet {{on the behavior of}} edge localized modes (ELMs). The energy absorption by pellet and its further displacement due to ExB drift as well as transport enhancement by the pellet were found to be able to trigger the ELM. The ablated cloud of <b>pellet</b> <b>absorbs</b> the background plasma energy and causes the radial redistribution of pressure due to the subsequent ExB drift. On the other hand, the sharp increase in local density and temperature gradients in the vicinity of ablated cloud could cause transient enhancement of heat and particle transport. Both mechanisms produce a region of an increased pressure gradient in the background plasma profile within the pedestal, which triggers the ELM. The mechanisms have the potential to explain a wide range of experimental observations. 1...|$|R

40|$|Alfalfa pellets {{have been}} known to {{generate}} dust and fines because of repeated handling and transport. During transport, this product loses or gains moisture which may affect its quality. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} manufacture pellets which are not prone to breakage but still can be palatable to animals. Experiments were conducted to determine the effect of chop quality, process and machine variables on the quality of alfalfa pellets. Three different qualities of alfalfa chops namely, low, intermediate and high quality, were used in the experiments. The chemical components and physical characteristics of alfalfa chops and grinds were determined. Pellets were made from alfalfa grinds and from alfalfa grinds mixed with binders. Durability and hardness of pellets were evaluated after manufacture and also after a period of storage at 28 °C and 90 % relative humidity. To study their compressibility, alfalfa grinds were compressed in a single pelleter and the tensile strength of pellets was determined by diametral compression test. Of four models considered, the Cooper-Eaton model provided the best fit to the particle compression data (volume or density of pellets versus applied pressure). Parameters determined from the Heckel and Cooper-Eaton models indicated that grinds from low quality alfalfa chops densified readily by particle rearrangement. Grinds from intermediate and high quality alfalfa chops produced pellets which required lower yield stress for plastic deformation (PY) and were, therefore, more compressible. The tensile strength of pellets increased with compression pressure during pellet formation and peaked at 100 MPa. Conditioner temperatures of 92 °C and above and conditioned grind moistures of 8. 5 to 10 % w. b. were ideal for pelleting. High durability pellets were produced in a high length-to-diameter ratio die. High temperature of pellets extruded out of the pelleter die resulted in high durability. The particle size of the grinds, die speed and pellet temperature were regressed to pellet durability, such relationships could be used for pellet mill control. Collagen protein, hydrated lime, lignosulfonate, bentonite and pea starch were the binders used with three chop qualities at inclusion rates depending on their cost. The durability of pellets made from low quality alfalfa chops was improved by addition of binders. However, the effect of binders on pellets made from intermediate and low quality chops was negligible. Hydrated lime and pea starch were identified as potential binders. Additional pelleting trials conducted showed that an inclusion rate of 0. 5 % of either hydrated lime or pea starch was adequate for improving the durability of low quality alfalfa pellets. Extending the conditioning time from the usual 17 - 22 s to 35 - 40 s did not affect binder performance nor did it improve the durability or hardness of pellets. Experiments were also conducted to determine the effect of high humidity storage on the physical characteristics of pellets. Moisture absorption data were modeled using the exponential model. Pellet durability decreased when the <b>absorbed</b> <b>pellet</b> moistures exceeded 10 or 12 %. Pellet hardness was sensitive to moisture change. In summary, the results from these experiments revealed that the physical quality of dehydrated alfalfa pellets was a function of both process and machine variables. Alfalfa chop quality also affected pellet quality and results showed that binder usage could help rectify variations in pellet durability...|$|R
30|$|About 6  g of pond ash sample (passing through 75  μm IS sieve) {{was taken}} and 0.6 gm of boric acid {{was added to}} prepare the sample.

40|$|Nitrogen is an {{effective}} material for improving the crop production. Cow manure is an important resource for organic nitrogen which improves the physical condition of soil. More usage of chemical nitrogen as the fertilizer in soil has raised concerns, because some forms of nitrogen absorbs in soil and causes an increase in pollution of environmental water and {{costs associated with the}} manufacture and distribution of nitrogen fertilizer. An effective solution is to apply densification technology with molding of manure compost into pellet and adjusting the nutrient content by adding nitrogen fertilizer. The objective {{of this study was to}} understand the response of grain yield of wheat (Triticium sp.) and its components under various levels of the portion of urea and manure as well as different compressive forces to determine the potential of slow-release of the fertilizer. The chemical fertilizer was added to the pellets within moisture content of 11 to 24 % (w. b.). The results showed that density and porosity of pellets increased with increase in moisture content and applied force. The <b>pellets</b> <b>absorbed</b> moisture up 8 % within 24 h depending on temperature and air relative humidity. The effects of slow-release from mixed pellets in wheat yield were also observed. Pellet processing can be used as a method for slow-release of nitrogen fertilizer that reduces leaching losses and enhanced nitrogen uptake, as well as positive effects on both health and soil nutrient levels...|$|R
40|$|Lansoprazole (LSP), a proton-pump inhibitor, {{belongs to}} class II drug. It is {{especially}} instable to heat, light, and acidic media, indicating that fabrication of a formulation stabilizing {{the drug is}} difficult. The addition of alkaline stabilizer {{is the most powerful}} method to protect the drug in solid formulations under detrimental environment. The {{purpose of the study was}} to characterize the designed multiple coating pellets of LSP containing an alkaline stabilizer (sodium carbonate) and assess the effect of the stabilizer on the physicochemical properties of the drug. The coated pellets were prepared by layer–layer film coating with a fluid-bed coater. In vitro release and acid-resistance studies were carried out in simulated gastric fluid and simulated intestinal fluid, respectively. Furthermore, the moisture-uptake test was performed to evaluate the influence of sodium carbonate on the drug stability. The results indicate that the drug exists in the amorphous state or small (nanometer size) particles without crystallization even after storage at 40 °C/ 75 % for 5  months. The addition of sodium carbonate to the pellet protects the drug from degradation in simulated gastric fluid in a dose-dependent manner. The moisture <b>absorbed</b> into the <b>pellets</b> has a detrimental effect on the drug stability. The extent of drug degradation is directly correlated with the content of moisture absorption. In conclusion, these results suggest that the presence of sodium carbonate influence the physicochemical properties of LSP, and the designed multiple coating pellets enhance the drug stability...|$|R
40|$|In avian species it {{has been}} {{difficult}} to elucidate the precise role of melatonin in the control of reproductive cycles. We have investigated ways of administering melatonin to immature chickens and laying hens to achieve physiological levels and patterns in blood simulating either short or long photoperiods. Melatonin was administered orally using different doses and various ways of applying melatonin to the feed. For subcutaneous injections, melatonin was suspended in propylene glycol or grape seed oil. Melatonin always appeared in the first blood samples taken within an hour of administration. When melatonin was <b>absorbed</b> into feed <b>pellets</b> or whole wheat, a high initial plasma concentration was reached, followed by a rapid decrease over the ensuing 2 - 3 hr, but was still detectable as long as 24 hr after administration. For example, doses of 300 microg/kg produced 15 nM, which is more than ten times higher than the nocturnal peak concentration. When melatonin was absorbed into cracked wheat grains that were subsequently washed with ethanol, the initial transitory peak was eliminated, levels in plasma were sustained for at least 12 hr in the normal nocturnal range (750 pM), and no melatonin (< 60 pM) was present 18 hr later. When injected (2 microg/bird), concentrations peaked (610 pM) within 30 min and decreased rapidly over the next 2 - 3 hr. It was concluded that melatonin-treated, ethanol-rinsed cracked wheat grains can be used to experimentally mimic long-night plasma melatonin patterns. Injections may be useful for mimicking the melatonin patterns of very short nights in chickens experiencing constant light...|$|R
40|$|A {{promising}} reusable sorbent for desulfurizing hot {{coal gas}} {{is being developed}} {{in the form of}} core-in-shell pellets which consist of a highly reactive CaO core encased in a porous protective shell made largely of an inert material. The spherical pellets are made by pelletizing plaster of Paris and then applying a coating of alumina (80 %) and limestone (20 %) particles. Subsequent high temperature treatment converts the cores to CaO and sinters the coating material to form the porous shells. The <b>pellets</b> <b>absorb</b> and react with H 2 S at high temperatures (e. g., 800 − 900 °C) to form CaS and are regenerated by applying a cyclic oxidation/reduction method. The rate of sulfidation {{does not appear to be}} controlled by chemical reaction but, instead, seems to be controlled by one or more of the following diffusion resistances:[*] external gas film, porous shell, micropores between CaO grains in the core, and product layer surrounding CaO within each grain. After considering various models, a brief review of which is included in the paper, a semiempirical model was chosen which represents the process well over a limited range of conversion (approximately 0 − 85 %). This is not a serious limitation for the model because above this range the rate of conversion becomes too slow for most applications. The model assumes that within this range the rate of conversion is controlled by the resistance to diffusion offered by the porous outside shell together with the resistance to diffusion presented by a porous layer of reacted material. The model is in effect an extension of the well-known shrinking, unreacted core model for gas−solid reactions. As more basic diffusion data become available, a more rigorous model, such as a modified grain model, is expected to be developed...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Factors that {{influenced}} the uptake, storage, and elimination of dietary quinoline by rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) were studied {{to obtain an}} understanding of the mechanisms affecting the bioaccumulation of dietary contaminants in teleosts. Rainbow trout readily <b>absorbed</b> ¹⁴C-quinoline from <b>pelleted</b> food (1 % ration at 138 ug quinoline/g food) and most tissues reached apparent steady-state after 10 days feeding. Maximum whole-body concentrations of quinoline plus metabolites were only 30 ng/g after 7 days depuration. Uptake rate constants ranged from 0. 00006 /day for muscle to 0. 1455 /day for gallbladder plus bile. Mean elimination half-life for quinoline-derived radioactivity ranged from 0. 4 days in gills to 8. 7 days for muscle. Depending on tissue, 58 - 83 % of the stored radioactivity was present as metabolites. About 14 % of the radioactivity in the bile was present as glucuronide conjugates. Quinoline was absorbed from the stomach by rainbow trout and peak serum levels occurred 4 - 8 hr after a single feeding. Pharmacokinetics were described using a two-compartment body model with first-order absorption and disposition; estimated half-lives for the a and B phase were 4. 1 and 54. 1 hr, respectively. Depending on dose, 71 to 83 % of the ingested radioactivity was excreted during the first 24 hr after feeding. Branchial excretion was the primary route of excretion, all other routes (fecal, biliary, urinary, dermal) contributing 99 % of quinoline was available for absorption. About 60 % of the residual body burden was stored in the gallbladder bile, but bile was retained only in starved fish. There was no evidence for enterohepatic circulation of quinoline or its metabolites following ejection of gallbladder bile. Increased feeding rates enhanced the movement of the food bolus and associated radioactivity through the intestine, but did not affect patterns of tissue disposition...|$|R
40|$|Segmental colonic transit {{has been}} {{measured}} in 101 patients. Two MBq of 111 Indium <b>absorbed</b> on resin <b>pellets</b> and encapsulated in an enteric coated capsule was given at 7 00 am. Hourly images {{during the first}} day, and three images during each subsequent day were acquired {{for up to three}} days. Using all scan and patient data the scans were categorised in one of the five patterns of colonic transit: normal, rapid, right delay, left delay, or generalised delay. The geometric centres and per cent activity at each time point was compared between the five groups of colonic transit patients to find the best time for imaging and so to distinguish the five groups. During the first day, early images did not help in diagnosis of patterns of transit, however, in the later images (six hours onwards after the ingestion of the activity) the rapid transit groups could be identified. Images at 27 and 51 hours were both required to distinguish all five groups of patients from each other. Only in the 'normal' transit patients was there some excretion of the activity {{during the course of the}} second day, otherwise there was no difference in the images taken in the course of a day (second or third day). A simplified protocol requires a minimum of three images to distinguish all five patterns of colonic transit. The activity should be ingested in the morning (7 00 am) and the first image taken at the end of the working day (8 - 10 hours after ingestion), the second image on the morning of the second day, and the third image during the course of the third day. This simple protocol would provide all the clinically relevant information necessary for correct classification of the colonic transit...|$|R
