5|$|The Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank (PIAT) Mk I was a British man-portable <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapon</b> {{developed}} during the Second World War. The PIAT was designed in 1942 {{in response to the}} British Army's need for a more effective infantry <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapon,</b> and entered service in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1941, more {{sophisticated}} weapons were made {{available such as}} the Blacker Bombard <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapon,</b> the Northover Projector (a black-powder mortar), and the Smith Gun (a small artillery gun that could be towed by a private motorcar).|$|E
5|$|The Projector, 2.5inchmore {{commonly}} known as the Northover Projectorwas an ad hoc <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapon</b> used by the British Army and Home Guard during the Second World War. With a German invasion of Great Britain seeming likely after the defeat in the Battle of France, most available weaponry was diverted to the regular British Army, leaving the Home Guard short on supplies, particularly anti-tank weaponry. The Northover Projector was designed by a Home Guard officer named Robert Harry Northover to act as a makeshift <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapon,</b> and was put into production in 1940 following a demonstration to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill.|$|E

At 01:30, two German tanks attempted to drive onto the bridge, but were repelled with the loss of one tank to a PIAT <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} that he {{developed}} the Baby Bombard and sent it off the War Office, Blacker was working for a government department known as MD1, which was given the task of developing and delivering weapons for use by guerilla and resistance groups in Occupied Europe. Shortly after the trial of the Baby Bombard, Blacker was posted to other duties, and left the <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapon</b> {{in the hands of a}} colleague in the department, Major Millis Jefferis.|$|E
5|$|A flame fougasse (sometimes {{contracted}} to fougasse {{and may be}} spelled foo gas) {{is a type of}} mine or improvised explosive device which uses an explosive charge to project burning liquid onto a target. The flame fougasse was developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department in Britain as an <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapon</b> during the invasion crisis of 1940. During that period, about 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were deployed in some 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Although never used in combat in Britain, the design saw action later in Greece.|$|E

5|$|Given these shortcomings, those modern {{weapons that}} were {{available}} were allocated to the British Army, and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated anti-tank weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons, one such being the Smith Gun. The Smith Gun had what Mackenzie describes as an 'unorthodox origin', {{like many of the}} other weapons produced for use by the Home Guard. Invented by retired British Army Major William H. Smith, the managing director of Trianco Ltd., a firm of structural engineers. The Smith Gun was intended to be a cheap and easily manufactured <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|E

5|$|The closest large German unit to {{the canal}} bridge was the 2nd Battalion, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment based at Cairon. General Feuchtinger {{ordered them to}} {{recapture}} the bridges, and then attack the parachute landing zones further west. At 02:00, the 2nd Battalion headed for the bridges from the west, supported by the 1st Panzerjager Company {{and part of the}} 989th Heavy Artillery Battalion coming from the north. As the first Panzer IVs from the north reached the junction leading to the bridge, the leading vehicle was hit by a round from 'D' Company's only serviceable PIAT <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapon.</b> The vehicle exploded, setting off its stowed ammunition, and the other tanks withdrew.|$|E

5|$|As White had {{expected}} the survivors to {{fight their way}} out of Ngok Tavak, he made the decision to leave the dead allied soldiers behind; the decision caused distress amongst the survivors of the battle, but White believed evacuating the deceased soldiers through enemy lines would have been suicidal. After the Marines and Mobile Strike Force personnel had destroyed their unneeded equipment, they were directed to form an order-of-march out of Ngok Tavak, {{in order to protect the}} wounded and those with little infantry experience. Just before they left the garrison, Cameron blew up the first CH-46 helicopter that was still intact on the landing zone, using the M-72 <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapon.</b> The order-of-march was led by a group of Nung soldiers, who were followed by White and the survivors of the Marine artillery detachment, and behind them was another group of Nung soldiers covering the tail of the column. Together they evaded VC formations surrounding the hill feature of Ngok Tavak and marched eastward towards Khâm Đức.|$|E
5|$|Given these shortcomings, any modern {{weapons that}} were {{available}} were allocated to the British Army, and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons. One such weapon was the Northover Projector, the invention of Major Robert Harry Northover. Northover, {{an officer in the}} Home Guard, designed it to be an easily manufactured and cheap <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapon,</b> costing just under £10 to produce, excluding the required tripod. The Major wrote directly to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, with his design and arranged for Churchill to attend a demonstration of the Northover Projector. The Prime Minister approved of the weapon and gave it his personal endorsement, ordering in October 1940 that the weapon be mass-produced {{on a scale of one}} for every Home Guard platoon.|$|E

25|$|The Blacker Bombard, {{also known}} as the 29mm Spigot Mortar, was an {{infantry}} <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapon</b> devised by Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart Blacker {{in the early years of}} the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Intended as a {{means to}} equip Home Guard units with an <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapon</b> in case of German invasion, at a time of grave {{shortage}} of weapons, it was accepted only after the intervention of Churchill.

25|$|The Type 62 light tank is {{protected}} by steel armour. The front armour on the turret is 50mm thick while armour thickness on the hull armour varies from 15mm to 35mm.

50|$|It {{was said}} that plans to start {{production}} of the RAAD started in 1994 when Chinese and North Korean assistance was enlisted in producing missiles to boost its domestic weapons industry followed by actual production in 1995 with the actual weapon being unveiled by Defense Industries Organization on April 30, 1997. Due to shortage of Western-made <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapons,</b> it forced Iran to seek out alternate <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapons</b> that included {{the purchase of the}} 9K11 Malyutka.|$|R

25|$|The Japanese tried {{first to}} relieve the {{garrison}} at Meiktila and then to recapture the town and destroy its defenders. Their attacks were not properly coordinated and were repulsed. By the end of March the Japanese had suffered heavy casualties and lost most of their artillery, their chief <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapon.</b> They broke off the attack and retreated to Pyawbwe.|$|E
25|$|There {{were other}} {{weaknesses}} in the plan, which were revealed as the campaign progressed. The Japanese assumed that the British {{would be unable to}} use tanks on the steep jungle-covered hills around Imphal. For ease of movement and supply, the Japanese left behind most of their field artillery, their chief <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapon.</b> As a result, their troops would have little protection against tanks.|$|E
25|$|In 1940, the US Army {{just started}} to receive its first antitank gun, the 37 mm Gun M3. While it fitted {{the request of the}} Infantry for light, easy to manhandle <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapon,</b> Artillery and Ordnance foresaw a need for a more {{powerful}} gun. This led to a number of expedient designs, such as adaptations of the 75 mm M1897 or towed variants of the 75 mm M3.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anti-Tank</b> <b>weapons</b> {{include the}} RPG-7, 9K111 Fagot (650 ordered in 1987), 9K11 Malyutka, B-10 {{recoilless}} rifle and the B-11 recoilless rifle.|$|R
50|$|The {{mixed results}} were {{in part due}} to the {{development}} of infantry <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapons.</b> At the start of the Second World War most infantry units had weapons with some effectiveness against armoured targets at ranges of thirty to fifty meters, like anti-tank rifles. Towards the end of the war, more powerful <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapons</b> such as the bazooka, Panzerschreck, and PIAT were introduced which were fatal to tanks at ranges longer than the tank's flamethrower could reach.|$|R
5000|$|No {{tanks were}} damaged during Operation Protective Edge. The Merkava Mk. IVm tanks, fitted with the Trophy Active Protection system, intercepted {{anti-tank}} missiles and RPGs {{on dozens of}} different occasions during the ground operation. During the operation, the system intercepted <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapons,</b> primarily Kornet, as well as Metis-M and RPG-29, proving itself effective against man-portable <b>anti-tank</b> <b>weapons.</b> [...] By identifying the source of fire, Trophy also allowed tanks to kill the Hamas anti-tank team on one occasion.|$|R
