30|$|PVDF content {{has to be}} {{precisely}} controlled since insufficient PVDF content does not provide enough binding strength between the active graphene and the current collector {{and can lead to}} an adhesion issue. On the other hand, too much PVDF content reduces the conductivity of the supercapacitor electrode and thus reduces the energy density and power density of a supercapacitor. To minimize the adverse conductivity effect of PVDF, a certain percentage of conductive carbon such as carbon black (CB), acetylene black, etc. can be introduced to the mixture. It is reported that conductive carbon nanoparticles can (i) act as a filler material to suppress the aggregation of graphene nanosheets, (ii) improve rate capacity and cycle stability of the supercapacitor electrode, and (iii) maintain the high electrical conductivity of the electrode [8]. These conductive carbon materials are normally 20 – 50  nm in size [9], and are dispersed evenly onto graphene material.
