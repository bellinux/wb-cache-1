UPSCA said the circular was [...] "illegal, discriminatory, unreasonable, undemocratic and arbitrary." [...] They filed a case in court. Supreme Court dismissed the petition on technical grounds saying that UPSCA should have exhausted administrative remedies within the university. The decision came only in 1960. In effect, there was no USC from 1958-1960.|$|E
5000|$|For a while, the French government's {{claim that}} it was {{expelling}} people on legal rather than ethnic grounds was claimed to be [...] "openly contradicted by an <b>administrative</b> <b>circular</b> issue by the same government" [...] mentioning the illegal Romani camps specifically ("en priorité ceux des Roms"). This mention {{could be explained by}} the fact that Romani account for the overwhelming majority of foreign migrants setting up camps in France, and that [...] "most Roma from the two countries and Romania are thought to be in France illegally". The then French President Nicolas Sarkozy stated that his government had been unaware of the directive in question signed by Mr Michel Bart, the Chief of Staff of the French Minister of the Interior, and that the directive had been cancelled as soon as the government became aware of it through press reports. He stated that France continues to welcome refugees and that [...] "we refuse the creation of slums... that are unworthy of French Republic or European ideals." [...] President Sarkozy also stated that 80% of people removed from the camps during August 2010 were of French [...] "gens du voyage", i.e. most of the campers thus removed were not foreign citizens or Roma; and that all removals were done based on judicial decisions, i.e. they were not unilateral police operations as would be based on a circular directive.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt} Social {{exchange}} theory {{sheds light}} on the reciprocal relationship between perceptions of an organization’s enabling environment, capacity, and organizational motivation and staff willingness to maximize individual and collective performance. Yet, until recently, human resource specialists introduced cleaner, whiter, or more “colory” practices by <b>administrative</b> <b>circular</b> or order, typically after a modicum of consultation. Top-, middle-, and first-level managers would enforce adherence to the line. Organizations are communities, the members of which want worthwhile jobs that inspire them. Naturally, a committed and willing workforce brings substantial benefits. Some time ago, we recognized that formal relationships cannot by themselves be expected to conduce these entirely: implicit employer–employee exchanges matter. Belatedly, we concede that perceptions of an organization’s rules, ethos, and capabilities, not just the experience staff have of human resource practices, drive levels of effort and associated degrees of job satisfaction. More and more, organizations say {{they are looking for}} win–win solutions that match their needs with those of personnel: they examine the question of motivation with a fresh sense of purpose and conviction. Better still, high-performance organizations marshal and direct substantial resources to build effective behaviors and relationships, often in concert with human resource divisions. Engaging staff has come of age: in the 21 st century, the concept affirms the importance of flexibility, change, and unremitting improvement in the workplace...|$|E
40|$|Hong Kong {{is one of}} {{the first}} Asian cities/regions to apply Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) to major {{development}} plans. This paper shares the two decades of SEA experience in Hong Kong. In 1988, the Hong Kong Government issued a revised <b>administrative</b> <b>circular</b> to require new town developments and major land use/development proposals to conduct environmental assessment and this represents the first application of SEA for spatial planning in Hong Kong. The Territories Development Strategic Review completed in 1995 was the first major government plan to undergo a comprehensive SEA in Hong Kong. The SEA resulted in the government’s decision to explore sustainable development for Hong Kong. In 2004, the Environmental Protection Department of Hong Kong Government published the Hong Kong SEA Manual and in 2005 launched the SEA Knowledge Centre website. The website not only includes an interactive version of the SEA Manual, the local examples of SEA reports, study briefs, environmental outcomes but also information on the global environmental evaluations of policies and proposals, international web resources, links to other SEA knowledge centres, SEA practices in Mainland China, etc. With about 20 years of SEA experience, there has been increasing environmental awareness in the community and more and more requests from the public and environmental concerned groups to have wider application of SEA and potential broadening the scope to cover sustainability issues. The experience reflected the iterative and interactive dimensions of SEA in serving its purposes of facilitating options development; supporting informed public engagement and decision making; and having environmental gains...|$|E
40|$|Even though {{minorities}} {{have gained}} international linguistic recognition, accepting and admitting minority languages in public affairs {{has been a}} contested issue in many countries. In Sri Lanka, the admitting of minority language — specifically Tamil — in public administration has {{continued to be a}} serious issue imposing a number of difficulties on Tamil-speaking minorities, although Tamil is legally recognized as an official language. The district administration of Amparai in the eastern province is a severe case where Tamil has been marginalized in the district’s administrative affairs, violating the constitutional recognition of conducting public administration in Tamil in the north-eastern region. The major objective {{of this study is to}} examine the nature and extent of Tamil language admission in the district administration of Amparai. The findings of this study revealed that the violation of constitutional provisions and <b>administrative</b> <b>circulars</b> on admitting the Tamil language in district administration has not only led to the domination of the Sinhala language and the Sinhalese in this district’s administration, but also has induced the Tamil-speakers of this district to demand and advocate for a new administrative district within the district for their administrative easiness. This research suggests that proper implementation of Tamil language provisions and institutional restructuring at the district secretariat level would help to reconcile the linguistic issue...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn Europe, {{the idea}} that {{coordinating}} transportation and urban planning is {{a necessary condition for}} setting sustainable urban development into motion has spread throughout academic and professional circles. This idea is largely supported by the observation that the only metropolitan areas which have succeeded in containing automobile use (Bale, Berne, Zurich, Karlsruhe [...] .) are those which combine public transport development with various kinds of automobile use restrictions as well as urban planning and development measures. Despite a consensus {{that it is necessary to}} better coordinate mobility management with the development and organization of urbanized spaces, debate over the objectives and means behind this coordination remains relatively limited. In this research project, we have examined the actors in charge of urban travel and development in four French and Swiss metropolitan areas, and addressed questions about the relationship between the city and transportation over the last forty years. How has the shift in perspective - from adapting the city to the automobile toward promoting sustainable cities and mobilities - been translated into action? And what of local issues, visions, and coordination practices surrounding transportation and urban planning? What factors favor this kind of integration, and can we identify sources of inertia and causes of public action fragmentation? In this comparison, we have focused on the question of public policy change, considering either the concepts and the methods underlying the coordination of local urban planning and transport policy. The temporal perspective of analysis appears to be particularly appropriate for our problem, as the transport and urban planning coordination problem has persisted throughout the entire period, while referring to objectives and means of action that a priori (i. e. if we judge by the legal texts and <b>administrative</b> <b>circulars</b> which define them) have changed profoundly...|$|R

40|$|An {{examination}} of the formulation, interpretation and implementation of central government correspondence addressed in identical terms {{to a number of}} <b>administrative</b> bodies. <b>Circulars</b> are not required to conform to any legal standards regarding their form, content or publication and as a consequence have evolved unsystematically and haphazardly according to changing ideas about central-local relations, reflecting in a flexible manner the overridingly pragmatic style of the departments which issue them. Their initial role of guiding administrative practice while preserving local discretion has been supplemented by a more promotional national policy use. Certain post-war Acts gave important social services functions to local bodies but vested general supervisory duties in the appropriate Minister. Leaving these wide Ministerial responsibilities largely undefined paved the way for detailed policy intervention by the centre. Circulars began to introduce and enforce major policy changes throughout all local authorities. They have also been used to interpret or replace express statutory provisions, to elaborate legislative policy, to sub-delegate statutory powers and to lay down codes and procedures having legal effect. Although not deriving from statutory authority, these circulars must properly be regarded as law-making instruments forming a new third tier of legislation below Statutory Instruments. The legislative and judicial branches have lost effective control over these various policy and law-making functions performed by the executive. The constitutional dilemma is how to restore responsibility and democratic accountability without destroying the many practical advantages which circulars offer to central departments. <p...|$|R

40|$|Today, {{urban growth}} is a multidimensional spatial and {{population}} {{process in which}} cities and urban settlements are considered as centers of population focus owing to their specific economic and social features, which form a vital component {{in the development of}} human societies. The analysis of urban growth using spatial and attribute data of the past and present, is {{regarded as one of the}} basic requirements of urban geographical studies, future planning as well as the establishment of political policies for urban development. Mapping, modeling, and measurements of urban growth can be analyzed using GIS and remote sensing-based statistical models. In the present study, the aerial photos and satellite images of 5 periods, namely (1956 – 1965, 1965 – 1975, 1975 – 1987, 1987 – 2001, 2001 – 2012) were used to determine the process of expansion of the urban boundary of Bandar Abbas. Here, in order to identify the process of expanding urban boundaries with time, the <b>circular</b> <b>administrative</b> border of the city of Bandar Abbas, was divided into 32 different geographical directions. Here, Pearson’s Chi-square distribution as well as Shannon’s entropy is used in calculating the degree of freedom and the degree of sprawl for the analysis of growth and development of the cities. In addition to these models, the degree-of-goodness was also used for combining these models in the measurement and determination of urban growth. In this way, it was found that the city of Bandar Abbas has a high degree of freedom and degree of sprawl, and a negative degree of goodness in urban growth. Regardless of the results achieved, the current study indicates the capability of aerial photos and satellite imagery in the effectiveness of spatio-statistical models of urban geographical studies...|$|R
