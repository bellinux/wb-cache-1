5|$|The Court {{held that}} it can judicially review the {{exercise}} of prosecutorial power and declare <b>a</b> <b>prosecution</b> to be unconstitutional for breach of constitutional power, for example, if <b>a</b> <b>prosecution</b> is brought in bad faith for an ulterior motive and not to punish an accused person for an offence he or she committed. <b>A</b> <b>prosecution</b> {{can also be found}} to have infringed the accused person's constitutional rights. This may happen if law enforcement officers themselves commit crimes by using agents provocateur in a particularly egregious manner to entrap accused persons into committing crimes, and the Attorney-General elects to prosecute only the accused persons but not the officers, as this may infringe the accused persons' right to equality guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E

5|$|As a lawyer, Sawyer {{focused on}} civil {{litigation}} in corporate law, {{at which he}} excelled. He also {{spent much of his}} time in the field of civil liberties, for which he became more well-known but less well-compensated. In 1953, he was one of several defense attorneys in the case of United States v. Kuzma, <b>a</b> <b>prosecution</b> of Communist sympathizers under the Smith Act, which barred anyone from advocating for the overthrow of the American government. The defendants were found guilty, but their convictions were reversed in 1957 after the United States Supreme Court overturned the Smith Act in Yates v. United States.|$|E

5|$|In April 2010 The Guardian {{published}} {{an open letter}} from several public figures asking the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to proceed with <b>a</b> <b>prosecution</b> or explain its position.

Starmer said there was enough evidence for an assault charge, but the six-month deadline for that had expired.|$|E

5|$|The {{members of}} 2 Live Crew responded to these efforts by suing the Broward County sheriff in federal {{district}} court. The sheriff had previously told local retailers that selling the album {{could result in}} <b>a</b> <b>prosecution</b> for obscenity violations. While they were granted an injunction because law enforcement actions were an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech, {{the court ruled that}} the album was in fact obscene. However, an appellate court reversed the obscenity ruling, because simply playing the tape was insufficient evidence of the constitutional requirement that it had no artistic value.|$|E

5|$|After graduation, Sawyer {{joined the}} law firm of Drinker Biddle & Reath, where he {{remained}} for his entire career. Shortly after joining the firm, he was assigned to work as a temporary assistant district attorney in the O'Malley Case, <b>a</b> <b>prosecution</b> of political corruption in the city (the Philadelphia district attorney's office at that time was mostly staffed by part-time employees drawn from firms as needed). Working under lead prosecutor Laurence Howard Eldredge and alongside assistant prosecutor Lemuel Braddock Schofield, Sawyer assisted in the trial of Chief Magistrate John J. O'Malley for 206 counts of malfeasance in office. O'Malley was found not guilty in two trials in 1948 and 1949. Sawyer was called back into the Navy in 1950 during the Korean War and later as a foreign service officer in Europe. He returned to Philadelphia in 1953.|$|E
5|$|On {{checking}} {{records of}} telephone calls {{made to the}} dealer, the police found that some had been made from a mobile phone registered in Ireland, and on further checking the records of that phone {{it appeared that the}} calls were made from locations consistent with the known whereabouts of the Ford truck. One call was to a known IRA member. The phone was last used at 9:23am {{on the morning of the}} bombing, just three minutes after the bombers had parked their truck in Corporation Street. On 27 June, the phone's registered owner reported that it had been stolen 17days earlier, but the police felt they had gathered enough evidence to bring <b>a</b> <b>prosecution</b> against the six IRA men held in London.|$|E

5|$|Sir William Rae, the Lord Advocate, {{followed}} a regular technique: {{he focused on}} one individual to extract a confession on which the others could be convicted. Hare was chosen and, on 1 December, he was offered immunity from prosecution if he turned king's evidence and provided the full details {{of the murder of}} Docherty and any other; because he could not be brought to testify against his wife, she was also exempt from prosecution. Hare made a full confession of all the deaths and Rae decided sufficient evidence existed to secure <b>a</b> <b>prosecution.</b> On 4 December formal charges were lain against Burke and McDougal for the murders of Mary Paterson, James Wilson and Mrs Docherty.|$|E
5|$|The ACCC was successful, by a 2–1 majority, {{upon the}} remittal {{of the case}} to the full bench of the Federal Court. The full bench found that Baxter contravened Sections46 and 47 of the TPA. That {{judgment}} ended the eight-year-long litigation between Baxter and the ACCC. It {{was the first time in}} over 10 years that a corporation had unsuccessfully defended <b>a</b> <b>prosecution</b> brought by the ACCC for an alleged contravention of Section46. The full bench declared that Baxter breached Sections46 and 47 of the TPA, but left it to the ACCC to seek pecuniary penalties. Baxter was refused special leave to appeal to the High Court against the full bench's judgment.|$|E
5|$|Alexander F. Reichert was {{appointed}} by the Supreme Court to argue the case for Lara. Reichert argued that an Indian tribe had no inherent sovereignty in regards to non-member Indians, but only the power that Congress decided to give the tribe, citing Duro, Wheeler, and Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe to support his argument. He stated {{that it was the}} place of the Supreme Court, not Congress, to determine the inherent sovereignty of the tribe. Lara argued that since the tribe had no such inherent sovereignty, it could only prosecute a non-member Indian based upon federal sovereignty, which would make a subsequent Federal prosecution a violation of the prohibition of double jeopardy. It was noted that members of Indian tribes were at the same time United States citizens, and protected under the constitution {{in the same manner as}} any other citizen. Reichert stated that Duro was decided as a constitutional issue, not as a matter of common law, and it was the Court's place to determine the issue, not the place of Congress. To subject Lara to <b>a</b> <b>prosecution</b> by a tribal court, which was not subject to the Bill of Rights, would deprive Lara of his rights as a United States citizen. Lara's position was supported by amicus curiae briefs filed by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Lewis County, Idaho, (along with several other counties), the Citizen's Equal Rights Foundation, and T. Morris, E. Morris, and R. Morris (individual Indians).|$|E

5|$|The {{prosecution}} realized {{early on}} that issues relating to time would be {{an essential part of}} its case. At trial, each side presented witnesses to support their version of the timeline for the hours before and after the murder. The starting point was the time of death; the prosecution, relying on the analysis of stomach contents by their expert witness, argued that Phagan died between 12:00 and 12:15p.m. <b>A</b> <b>prosecution</b> witness, Monteen Stover, said she had gone into the office to get her paycheck, waiting there from 12:05 to 12:10, and did not see Frank in his office. The prosecution's theory was that Stover did not see Frank because he was at that time murdering Phagan. Stover's account did not match Frank's initial account that he had not left the office between noon and 12:30. Other testimony indicated that Phagan exited the trolley (or tram) between 12:07 and 12:10. From the stop it was a two- to four-minute walk, suggesting that Stover arrived first, making her testimony and its implications irrelevant: Frank could not be killing Phagan because at the time she had not yet arrived.|$|E
