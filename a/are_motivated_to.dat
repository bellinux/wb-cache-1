5|$|Gaze {{becomes more}} complex {{with age and}} practice. As gaze {{increases}} in complexity, individuals {{are better able to}} discriminate what others are referring to. Joint attention is also important for social learning. Gaze following reflects an expectation-based type of orienting in which an individual's attention is cued by another's head turn or eye turn. Individuals <b>are</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> follow another's gaze and engage in joint attention because gaze is a cue for which rewarding events occur.|$|E
5|$|Le Guin's {{interest}} in Taoism influenced {{much of her}} science fiction work. According to Douglas Barbour, the fiction of the Hainish Universe (the setting for several of Le Guin's works) contain a theme of balance between light and darkness, a central theme of Taoism. She was also influenced by her early {{interest in}} mythology, and her exposure to cultural diversity as a child. Her protagonists are frequently interested in the cultures they are investigating, and <b>are</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> preserve them rather than conquer them. Authors who influenced Le Guin include Victor Hugo, Leo Tolstoy, Virginia Woolf, Italo Calvino, and Lao Tzu.|$|E

50|$|Justinian I {{started a}} short period of mourning. He did not wear his crown for the forty days {{following}} the earthquake. The earthquake was later commemorated by an annual liturgy of supplication. Agathias also claimed there was a short-lived effect on the attitude of the population: the wealthy <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> charity, doubters <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> pray, and the vicious <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> virtue, all in an apparent effort of propitiation. Agathias reports that soon enough everyone lapsed into their former attitudes.|$|R

Participants are selected through partnerships with other non-profits or by the center's social worker, based on the criteria that they are economically disadvantaged and <b>are</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> train to achieve financial independence. Around 15–20 women are chosen twice a year to complete four to six months of training. After graduating from the training center, they are provided support to find relevant employment. As of June 2015 80% of Amal graduates have found employment in a relevant field.|$|E
5|$|Chlordiazepoxide is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used benzodiazepine for alcohol detoxification, but diazepam may be used as an alternative. Both are used in the detoxification of individuals who <b>are</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> stop drinking, and are prescribed {{for a short period of}} time to reduce the risks of developing tolerance and dependence to the benzodiazepine medication itself. The benzodiazepines with a longer half-life make detoxification more tolerable, and dangerous (and potentially lethal) alcohol withdrawal effects are less likely to occur. On the other hand, short-acting benzodiazepines may lead to breakthrough seizures, and are, therefore, not recommended for detoxification in an outpatient setting. Oxazepam and lorazepam are often used in patients at risk of drug accumulation, in particular, the elderly and those with cirrhosis, because they are metabolized differently from other benzodiazepines, through conjugation.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{researchers}} {{have criticized the}} indirect role of mutual exclusivity in word learning because an alternative explanation could account for children’s motivation to assign novel labels to novel objects. They may simply <b>be</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> fill the lexical gap created by a novel object rather than avoiding second labels.

5000|$|Russell H. Fazio {{proposed}} an alternative theory called [...] "Motivation and Opportunity as Determinants" [...] or MODE.

Simply put, when an attitude is automatically activated, the individual must <b>be</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> avoid making an invalid judgement as well as {{have the opportunity to}} reflect on their attitude and behavior.|$|R
25|$|As {{children}} {{gain more}} {{roles and responsibilities}} within their families, their eagerness to participate also increases. For example, Young Mayan children of San Pedro, Guatemala learn {{to work in the}} fields and family run businesses because they <b>are</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> contribute to their family. Many San Pedro women learned to weave by watching their mothers sew when they were children, sometimes earning their own wool through doing small tasks such as watching young children of busy mothers. Eager to learn and contribute, these young girls helped other members of their community in order to help their mothers with their weaving businesses or through other tasks such as helping carry water while young boys helped with tasks such as carrying firewood alongside their fathers.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{suggest that}} people attempt to {{establish}} and maintain a desired personal image in social situations. People <b>are</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> present themselves towards others in a good light, and some researchers suggest that the optimistic bias is a representative of self-presentational processes: people want to appear more well-off than others. However, this is not through conscious effort. In a study where participants believed their driving skills would be either tested in either real-life or driving simulations, people who believed they were to be tested had less optimistic bias and were more modest about their skills than individuals who would not be tested. Studies also suggest that individuals who present themselves in a pessimistic and more negative light are generally less accepted by the rest of society. This might contribute to overly optimistic attitudes.|$|E

[...] Monster has responded by saying that markups are determined by the retailer and are usually less than those found on clothing, jewelry and furniture.|$|E

[...] However, {{it is likely that the}} average age of Žirmūnai's residents has decreased since the last census, and will continue to decrease, as a result of the active construction of new dwellings, which are acquired primarily by younger people.

In Gingles, the Supreme Court split {{as to whether}} plaintiffs must prove that the majority racial group votes as a bloc specifically because its members <b>are</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>to</b> vote based on racial considerations and not other considerations that may overlap with race, such as party affiliation. A plurality of justices said that requiring such proof would violate Congress's intent to make Section 2 a [...] "results" [...] test, but Justice White maintained that the proof was necessary to show that an electoral scheme results in racial discrimination. Since Gingles, lower courts have split on the issue.|$|E
