The objective {{of the study was to}} determine what could cause instability in noise barrier structure, as well as the comparison on the effects of different noise barriers. This investigation was carried out using certified acoustics equipment, and variety of locations. Testing of plywood, steel and concrete barriers were conducted at different locations. Results for plywood indicate that most vibration or acceleration recorded in the whole barrier were recorded at the top panel with less acceleration recorded in middle panel and smallest amount recorded near the ground. All results had very significant fluctuations of amplitude. <b>Autospectrum</b> analysis conducted on the results indicated that most of the fluctuations of the panel happened within low frequency noise range. Steel barrier results indicate as with plywood that most vibration or acceleration recorded in the whole barrier were recorded at the top panel with less acceleration recorded in middle panel and smallest amount recorded near the ground. All results had very significant fluctuations of amplitude. <b>Autospectrum</b> analysis conducted on the results indicated that higher frequency noise has also very significant effect on barrier fluctuations as well as low frequency range. Concrete barrier results on other hand indicate that most vibration or acceleration recorded in the whole barrier were recorded at the top panel with less acceleration recorded in middle panel and significant amount recorded near the ground. Compared to other barriers fluctuations are much smaller. <b>Autospectrum</b> analysis conducted on the results indicated that low frequency noise range has predominant effect on the barrier fluctuations. It was found that different types of noise barriers behave differently under continues low frequency noise application. In order to investigate and fully comprehend structural instability in noise barriers these tests are vital to the design and construction. However, further investigations were highly recommended and should be carried out to understand more structural properties of noise barriers. ...|$|E
40|$|In anaesthetised rats, {{activity}} recorded from sympathetic postganglionic neurones innervating {{the tail}} circulation has characteristic rhythmicity (0 · 4 - 1 · 2 Hz). At the population level this rhythmicity {{can be seen}} as a peak (T-peak) in <b>autospectra</b> of sympathetic activity recorded from ventral collector nerves (VCNs). Here we investigated whether nerves supplying thermoregulatory circulations share common rhythmic discharges at T-peak frequency. Activity was recorded from nerve pairs consisting of left ventral collector nerve (LVCN) and one of the following: right ventral collector nerve (RVCN), left dorsal collector nerve (DCN), left saphenous nerve (SN) or left renal nerve (RN). During central apnoea, T-peak frequencies in RVCN <b>autospectra</b> were similar to those of simultaneously recorded LVCN and these activities were coherent. Similar observations were made for nerve pairs involving LVCN-DCN and LVCN-SN. In contrast, <b>autospectra</b> of RN activity did not contain T-peaks. In comparison to the peaks in <b>autospectra</b> of RN activity, when the frequency of rhythmic phrenic nerve activity was manipulated T-peaks in VCN, DCN and SN <b>autospectra</b> did not show obligatory 1 : 1 locking. We conclude that T-peaks are a robust feature of <b>autospectra</b> of sympathetic discharges supplying thermoregulatory circulation but not those influencing the kidney. The high coherence demonstrated between the T-peak discharges is consistent with the view that common/coupled oscillators located within the CNS influence cutaneous vasoconstrictor sympathetic activity...|$|R

The procedures compute the entire spectral matrix of <b>autospectra</b> and cross spectra for {{the set of}} 2 -D signals. Spectral analysis by autoregressive (AR) modeling is studied extensively.

More often, CBF is not decreased despite upright neurocognitive dysfunction. This may result from time-dependent changes in CBF. We hypothesized that increased oscillations in CBF occurs in POTS (N= 12) compared to healthy controls (N= 9), and tested by measuring CBF velocity (CBFv) by transcranial Doppler ultrasound of the middle cerebral artery, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and related parameters, supine and during 70 o upright tilt. <b>Autospectra</b> for mean CBFv and MAP, and transfer function analysis were obtained over the frequency range of 0. 0078 to 0. 4 Hz.

Increased oscillatory BP in upright POTS patients is closely coupled to oscillatory CBFv over a narrow bandwidth corresponding to the Mayer wave frequency.

The study was under-taken to evaluate the proficiency of an experimental configuration by NDBC; unfortunately, the ADCP was not optimally configured. The higher temporally and vertically resolved bottom-mounted ADCP data are interpolated in time and depth to match the buoy-mounted ADCP measurements.

Methods: Studies were performed in ten healthy male subjects (23. 966. 3 years). Esophageal electrostimulation was carried out using a stimulating electrode placed in the distal esophagus. Stimulation of esophageal vago-afferent fibres was employed using electrical impulses (200 ms at 0. 2 Hz 3 128 s) varying from 2. 7 to 20 mA. Respiratory frequencies, beat-to-beat heart rate <b>autospectra</b> and cerebral evoked potentials were recorded at baseline and at each stimulus intensity in random order.

There was a dramatic shift of the instantaneous heart rate power spectra towards enhanced cardiac vagal modulation with intensities as low as 5 mA. This effect was sustained throughout all intensities with no further change in either the low frequency or high frequency power. Conversely, there was a linear dose response relationship between cerebral evoked potential amplitude and stimulus intensity mainly occurring above perception threshold (10 mA).

The antospectrum of SPL during free dystonic contraction showed an absence of a significant peak at 10 to 12 Hz in 8 of the 10 patients. The presence of a 5 to 7 Hz frequency drive showed a significant association with muscle pairs determined as dystonic by means of polymyography (P < 0. 005). The neck posture predicted blindly, based on the low-frequency drive, correlated significantly with the clinical assessment of posture (P < 0. 01). Conventional assessment and the results of frequency analysis correlated, suggesting that a low-frequency drive to neck muscle may be a general feature of simple rotational and more complex cervical dystonia. The pattern of coherence between the EMG in different neck muscles may provide a means of identifying leading dystonic muscles, especially in patients with complex cervical dystonia.

40|$|Ambient {{noise studies}} along the North American west coast benefit greatly from {{the efforts of}} Wenz in the 1960 s to collect, compile and publish [1] ambient noise levels {{measured}} from then-newly deployed U. S. Navy hydrophone systems. In the early 1990 s, the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL-UW) was granted access to these systems and began a long-term program collecting short-time ambient noise <b>autospectra.</b> This paper addresses comparisons between the Wenz levels and recent measurements for four receivers systems denoted D, F, G and H. (See Fig. 1.) Systems D and F are decommissioned: G and H remain classified. Although the Wenz and APL-UW datasets are unique in that both use the same in-water components (hydrophones, cables), the shore-side electronics have changed over the decades. A representative instrumentation diagram is shown in Fig. 2. The APL-UW effort introduced, and: was given in Navy documentation. The first published findings from this effort [2] involved relative statistics, but not absolute levels, because, and were unknown. This problem was circumvented [3] for system D using a nearby system, and again for system F using a co-located recorder deployed by McDonald et al. [4]. Motivated by the McDonald data, and were recently recovered. Calibrations (with the exception of, of order +/- 2 dB) now exist for all four systems, allowing comparison against the Wenz data.

40|$|Tiltrotor {{aircraft}} are a potentially viable means of intercity travel. The tiltrotor {{is able to}} transport passengers relatively quickly {{from the center of}} a city to destinations within a 300 -mile radius. For such vehicles to be commercially viable, the interior noise and vibration levels must be acceptable to the passengers. A review of the literature revealed very little structural-acoustic data related to the tiltrotor. For this reason, structural-acoustic measurements were taken aboard an XV- 15 tiltrotor. The six flight conditions included five in level flight, nominally 140 - 220 knots, for airplane mode (nacelle at 0 degrees) and one out-of-ground-effect (OGE) hover (nacelle at 90 degrees). The flight test measurements included nine exterior surface pressures, five structural accelerations, and two interior pressures. These sensors were located near the tip path plane on the port side of the aircraft. One minute of data was acquired at each condition. The data is presented as time histories, <b>autospectra,</b> coherence functions, and cross-spectra. In general, for level flight, the measured data showed very little effect of forward flight speed except to change the amplitude of the response; however, the character of the response was found to be dependent on spatial location. In contrast, in the hover mode the spatial location had very little effect on the character of the response. Additionally, the report highlights: the coherence between the transducer data and the rotor tach signal; and transfer function calculations between the exterior pressures...|$|R
40|$|During 1986 - 1987, {{an array}} of {{horizontal}} electrometers (which measure the subinertial baretropic velo-city) was deployed for 11 months in the central North Pacific to study atmospherically forced motions in a low eddy kinetic energy region. Significant coherence {{is found to be}} ubiquitous between the baretropic velo-city and one or more surface atmospheric variables over the North Pacific. The maximum squared coherence between currents and wind stress curl at all periods greater than 3 days is typically 0. 6, rarely below 0. 4, and occasionally above 0. 8, and is dominantly nonlocal, although local coherence is seen at some sites, especially at the shorter periods. Both the coherence and the intersite pattern similarity are strongest at the periods of relative maxima in the baretropic current <b>autospectra</b> (e. g., at 6 - 8, 10 - 14, and 20 - 50 days). The locations at which the wind stress curl forces the motions at each site and for each period have been determined. While there is substantial intersite variability, some of the observed patterns of squared coherence over the North Pacific are very similar to those predicted by simple, linear, smooth-bottomed, quasi-geostrophic models of atmospherically forced baretropic currents. The forcing location is occasionally found to be the same spot for all oceanic instruments, especially at the auto spectral maxima in baretropic current. More commonly, dis-tinct forcing locations are found for each instrument even when closely spaced, suggesting topographic influence. In other cases, multiple forcing locations are implicated for the motions at a single station. All o...|$|R
