500|$|I {{am pleased}} to {{announce}} the Kingston Trio legacy will be carried forth by Josh Reynolds, Mike Marvin and Tim Gorelangton, who will begin performing as the Kingston Trio in October 2017. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> know, Josh {{is the son of}} founding member, and my friend and partner Nick Reynolds, and Mike Marvin is Nick’s cousin. Rounding it out is Tim Gorelangton, one of the only people Nick ever recorded with outside the Trio. [...] It was Nick Reynolds’ and my fondest hope that Josh and Mike would carry on the Trio and family legacy.|$|E
500|$|Chaitanya {{is seen as}} {{the father}} of a six-year-old in 1980s and a happy-go-lucky college student in 2013. He {{described}} the former role as a challenging one. He also said that both the roles would have multiple layers and added, [...] "The film <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> would know by now, is spread across three generations, and all the characters go back and forth in time. I play a happy-go-lucky college guy in the present era. It's a typically fun character and has nothing in common with my character from the flashback. So acting wise, it was a big challenge". He described the drunk scenes shared with Nagarjuna, Nageswara Rao and his confrontation scene with Samantha {{towards the end of the}} film as the toughest scenes to act.|$|E

2500|$|You pledged {{during the}} last debate {{that you would not}} raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. But the price of {{everything}} is going up, and we all know it.

My question is, how can you or any president, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that we're running up to our children? ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{soon as the}} {{deadline}} for Mayweather's response expired, Arum held a conference call. Arum revealed to the media that the negotiations he had been referring to consisted {{of a series of}} conversations with HBO Sports President Ross Greenburg. He also revealed that there was no actual direct communication with any representative from Team Mayweather or Golden Boy Promotions: I had a couple of conversations with Ross [...] and I laid out all the terms that would be acceptable to our side and I also informed him about the concession that Manny had made regarding drug testing. He got back to me {{in a couple of weeks}} and told me that he had had discussions with Al Haymon, representing Floyd Mayweather, and that everything looked good and we were nearing a resolution...The subsequent conversations with Ross detailed to me conversations he had with Al Haymon. Nowhere was the name Richard Schaefer or Golden Boy mentioned, although I read, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> did, Oscar's statement that a deal was close, so I assumed from that Haymon was keeping Schaefer and Golden Boy abreast of the situation.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Pumpkins {{reformed}} in 2007, Corgan posted {{a message to}} the band's blog saying that they were [...] "ooking for girls from Siamese Dream album cover... <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> know, they were quite young when the photo was taken. They are not conjoined anymore, as far as we know." [...] The band's intentions for the search were never made clear. In February 2011, Billy Corgan announced via Twitter that not only had one of the girls been found, she was the current bassist for the Pumpkins, Nicole Fiorentino. According to Corgan, [...] "Just found out the weirdest news: our bass player Nicole just admitted {{she is one of the}} girls on the cover of Siamese Dream." [...] However, according to the assistant photographer for Siamese Dream, the cover photo was probably shot specifically for the album. Given Fiorentino's age at the time of the album, this would make her too old to be on the cover of the album.
