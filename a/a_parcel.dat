5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water vapor <b>a</b> <b>parcel</b> of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate <b>a</b> <b>parcel</b> of air is to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which <b>a</b> <b>parcel</b> must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E

5|$|David Hudson (February 17, 1761– March 17, 1836) was an American {{businessman}} {{noted for}} founding Hudson Township, the present-day Hudson, Ohio. Hudson {{was born in}} Branford, Connecticut and lived there until the age four when {{his family moved to}} Goshen, Connecticut. He lived in Goshen for many years, owning a farm, marrying Anna Norton in 1783 and raising the oldest seven of their nine children there. In 1789, Hudson joined a group to purchase <b>a</b> <b>parcel</b> of land in the Connecticut Western Reserve. The following year, he left Goshen to survey the parcel and settle it as Hudson Township. Hudson traveled through the state of New York, west along Lake Erie and south along the Cuyahoga River to reach his land.|$|E
5|$|Following the letters, Jackson {{received}} <b>a</b> <b>parcel</b> {{containing a}} photograph of the fan, as well as a letter and a gun. Jackson was horrified; the letter asked that the pop singer kill himself on a certain day and at a specific time. The fan would do the same once she had killed their baby. She wrote that if they could not be together in this life, then they would be in the next. To his mother's dismay, Jackson had the photograph of the woman framed and hung above the dining room table of their family home. Afterwards, the Jacksons discovered that the fan had been sent to a psychiatric hospital.|$|E
5|$|Greek Revival residences {{were first}} built in Troy along Second Street {{in the late}} 1820s. In 1839, six local {{businessmen}} bought <b>a</b> <b>parcel</b> of land between Second and Third {{at the south end}} of what was then the developed area of the city and created Washington Park. Modeled on contemporary British residential squares such as those found in London's Bloomsbury neighborhoods, its first phase, on Washington Place, featured rows of townhouses with a unified facade fronting on a park reserved exclusively for residents, whose deeds require a monthly maintenance fee. It retains its integrity despite some later alterations and damage, and is one of only two privately owned urban parks in New York.|$|E

5|$|Heat bursts {{are rare}} {{atmospheric}} phenomenon characterized by gusty winds and a {{rapid increase in}} temperature and decrease in dew point (moisture). Heat bursts typically occur during night-time and are associated with decaying thunderstorms. In association with wake lows, heat bursts are caused when rain evaporates (virga) into <b>a</b> <b>parcel</b> of cold dry air high in the atmosphere making the air denser than its surroundings. The parcel descends rapidly, warming due to compression, overshoots its equilibrium level and reaches the surface, similar to a downburst.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Saint Paul Public Schools {{purchased}} <b>a</b> <b>parcel</b> of land about a {{mile and}} half west of the Unidale Mall on University Avenue from 3M. Construction of the new facility was planned to start in 2005, costing $7 million. When construction bids were higher than expected, the price tag went up to $8 million and the project was postponed to allow for planning to reduce costs. Construction started in late November 2006 after price concerns had been resolved. The building opened in early December 2007, with a total cost of $7.5 million. It was dedicated one day before the two-year anniversary of Gordon Parks's death. He died on March 7, 2006; the building was dedicated on March 6, 2008.|$|E

5|$|Though {{concentrated}} in London, the outbreak affected {{other areas of}} the country as well. Perhaps the most famous example was the village of Eyam in Derbyshire. The plague allegedly arrived with a merchant carrying <b>a</b> <b>parcel</b> of cloth sent from London, although this is a disputed point. The villagers imposed a quarantine on themselves to stop the further spread of the disease. This prevented the disease from moving into surrounding areas but the cost to the village was the death of around 80% of its inhabitants over a period of fourteen months.|$|E
5|$|Yichang was keen for {{his eldest}} son to gain a basic {{education}} rooted in Confucianism, the dominant moral ideology of Chinese society; he deemed a knowledge of Confucian teaching to be essential in allowing his son to develop key business and administrative skills.

Yichang was particularly adamant {{on the need to}} learn about Confucianism after losing a lawsuit over <b>a</b> <b>parcel</b> of land; he believed that his opponent had been victorious in the dispute {{as a result of their}} ability to quote the sayings of ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius throughout their argument.|$|E
