40|$|The {{title of}} this work in {{combination}} with its inclusion in a corpus linguistics series seems to promise not only {{the chance to see}} actual swear words in print, but a whole lot of them as well. Reader beware. While Tony McEnery’s Swearing in English ultimately does deliver to those readers who expect all sorts of four-letter words, a more substantial part of the text is devoted to the topics listed in the secondary title, that is bad language, purity, and power, with swearing as the point of departure for and nucleus of a corpus-driven, mostly diachronic study of the discourse of bad language. Indeed, the respective frequencies of different swear words can only fascinate to a certain point, and so after a look at swear word usage in a particular corpus, McEnery increases the scope from swearing to talking about swearing, turning to additional corpora to investigate attitudes towards the use of bad language. No leaf is left unturned, as McEnery employs a variety of methodologies, which result in a dynamic investigation of swearing that is part corpus linguistics, part historical linguistics and part social commentary. The first chapter, ‘Bad language, bad manners’, consists of brief explanations of the role of social and political history, sociological theory and corpus linguistics in the analysis, as well as more detailed descriptions of the methodologies, corpora, analysis tools and techniques, <b>and</b> <b>literar...</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} reconcile Piers Plowman’s continual use of popular lyric traditions with {{the concerns that}} the poem raises regarding the moral value and didactic efficacy of poetic “making. ” The lyric is crucial to both the structure and poetic methods of Piers Plowman, shaping the poem’s most complex literary effects while bringing to focus the poem’s interrogation of the utility of literature generally. The result is that Piers Plowman is at its most and least “literary ” when it is being lyrical; although its lyric passages evoke popular modes of song and entertainment, they are, simultaneously, often so oddly integrated that their value is called into question. Both in its form and the expository discourses of its allegorical characters, the poem unites its unusual concordance of medieval poetic genres and commonplaces under a guiding principle of the ethics of literary production and consumption, yet also generates a continual friction between its modus agendi, or “way of proceeding, ” <b>and</b> its <b>literar...</b>|$|R

50|$|Born in Țăndărei, Ialomița County, {{his parents}} were Haralambie Georgiu (Grandea), a {{merchant}} of Aromanian origin, and his wife Maria (née Baldovin). He studied at the national {{school of medicine and}} pharmacy (1855-1859) and, intermittently, at Saint Sava High School in the national capital Bucharest, graduating in 1865. In 1866 and 1867, he took courses at the philosophy and literature faculty of the University of Liège, but did not graduate. He worked as an intern at Colțea Hospital (1860), a surgeon's assistant in Ilfov County (1861), a battalion's medic in Bucharest, a professor of natural sciences at the national school of medicine and pharmacy (1862-1863), secretary of the State Archives' document committee (1864), school inspector for Gorj and Mehedinți counties (1871) and interim professor at Bucharest (1868), Craiova (1874) and Bacău (1888). All these jobs were temporary, and for significant periods of time, he supported himself through journalism, working as an editor at Monitorul Oficial, Dâmbovița, Presa, Timpul and Războiul. A passionate and fairly talented newspaperman, he was chief editor for a number of periodicals, including Albina Pindului (1868-1878), Liceul român (1870), Steaua Daciei (1871), Tribuna (1873), Bucegiu (1879) and Sentinela (1887). He wrote for many of the country's major magazines and newspapers, including Foaie pentru minte, inimă și literatură, Amicul poporului, Familia, Trompeta Carpailor, Românul, Columna lui Traian <b>and</b> Universul <b>literar.</b> His anti-liberal political orientation presaged that of Mihai Eminescu.|$|R
50|$|Born into {{a peasant}} family in Vaslui, he {{attended}} primary school {{in his native}} village, followed by Vasile Lupu Normal School in Iași. He then taught school in Cursești, Vaslui County. He studied law at the Free University of Brussels, obtaining a doctorate. He worked as a Romanian-language teacher in Constanța and as a magistrate in Călărași and Tulcea. Under the name I. Blanc, his first work appeared in Adevărul illustrat. He also published in the magazines Viața, Foaia pentru toți, Convorbiri Literare, Sămănătorul, Luceafărul, Făt-Frumos, Viața literară și artistică, Ramuri <b>and</b> Neamul românesc <b>literar.</b> In 1905, together with I. U. Soricu and Nicolae Dașcovici, he published the weekly Tribuna Dobrogei. He authored a number of Sămănătorist short story collections and novels, including Flori de câmp (1900), Rătăcire (1902) and Sybaris (1902). He translated Guy de Maupassant, significantly {{reducing the amount of}} violence from the original. His useful monograph Constanța pitorească (1908) is in the spirit of Alexandru Vlahuță.

50|$|He {{adopted the}} pen name Dimitrie Stelaru in 1938, upon the {{suggestion}} of Eugen Jebeleanu. He wrote for Universul literar, Albatros, Gândul nostru <b>and</b> Adevărul <b>literar</b> și artistic, <b>and</b> later for Gazeta literară, Luceafărul, Tribuna and Steaua. He sporadically attended the Sburătorul literary circle. Noaptea geniului (1942) and Ora fantastică (1944; with a laudatory preface by Eugen Lovinescu) are representative works, encompassing all the lyrical motifs of his mature years. His 1968 autobiographical novel Zeii prind șoareci partly sheds light on his bohemian lifestyle in sordid environs. His odd jobs included: occasional porter at Bucharest North railway station, porter and dockworker at Constanța and Brăila, day laborer at Sighișoara. After his book Cetățile albe appeared in 1946, Stelaru underwent the fate of several in his literary generation, including Geo Dumitrescu and Constant Tonegaru. He declined to publish adult literature under the nascent communist regime with its socialist realist ethos until 1963, when Oameni și flăcări appeared. In the interim, he wrote short dramatic poems {{which at the time}} were classified as children's literature (Gelu, 1956; Șarpele Marao. Vrăjitoarele, 1957). The 1967 Mare incognitum, which he conceived as a definitive edition, includes a selection from his previous books as well as many new poems. In a second anthology, Coloane (1970), he offered a thematic unity by disregarding the chronological date of publication. Stelaru's work is uneven and difficult to classify by a single standard; his poetry is one of damnation and bohemian existence. Drawing freely from Edgar Allan Poe and especially Paul Verlaine, its is heavily marked by expressionism.|$|R

Published {{thanks to the}} help of an encouraging Camil Petrescu, it was favorably reviewed by Eugen Lovinescu but received a categorically negative note from George Călinescu. This was followed by Marea fugă (1938), Primăvara pe Târnave (vol. I-II, 1960-1963) and Lumea începe cu mine (1968). Her first play, Turneu în provincie, appeared in 1946. She would become among the most prolific Romanian playwrights of her day, with Cumpăna (1949), Vadul nou (1951), Premiera (1952), Oameni de azi (1952), Trei generații (1956) and Vlaicu și feciorii lui (1959), among others, as well as a large number of one-act works. A leading practitioner of socialist realism, she was much appreciated by the communist regime. Her short story collections include Destine (1939), Album de familie (1945), Oglinda (1957), Nunta Ilonei (1960), Făgăduielile (1964), La ora ceaiului (1970), Întoarcerea la miracol (1974), Te iubesc, viață (1984) and Plimbare în parcul liniștit (1987); she also authored the 1971 volume of travel notes Acuarele.

5000|$|She {{made her}} debut in 1920 in Viața Românească, with {{sketches}} titled Pagini răzlețe. Mantu's true identity was a well-kept secret: {{not even the}} magazine editors {{knew who she was}} until Sadoveanu recognized an anecdote he had told her in one of her submissions. She also wrote for Adevărul <b>literar</b> <b>and</b> Însemnări literare. Her short prose was published as Miniaturi (1923), Umbre chinezești (1930) and Instantanee (1945). Her 1924 novel Cucoana Olimpia appeared in Italian in 1932 as Gente moldava. She translated numerous works from Russian, including ones by Nikolai Gogol, Ivan Turgenev and Ivan Goncharov. In 1923, she was awarded the Romanian Writers' Society prize in 1923. George Călinescu characterized her as being talented in [...] "miniatures, moments, little observations, often delicate," [...] capable of shedding light on [...] "the provincial soul, indiscreet, malicious in its perseverance and hypocrisy". A more generous Mihai Ralea asserted that her [...] "every impression, every phrase is deeply refined, chiseled, reworked not just for maximum effect, but up to the highest expression of perfection".|$|R
5000|$|Born into a Bucharest Jewish {{family of}} small craftsmen, his father Nathan Peltz was a tailor, {{while his mother}} Eara (née Rotenberg) made linens. He was self-taught, and {{reportedly}} studied Jewish theology, {{although there is no}} documentary evidence to support the notion. In 1915, he edited and wrote Îndrumarea magazine, which appeared for only a brief period; this marks his published debut. His first book was the 1916 essay Menirea literaturii, in which he argued for a [...] "message literature" [...] and stressed the importance of ethics. In 1916, he worked as a proofreader at Gazeta ilustrată. In 1918, he was an editor for Scena and Presa liberă; the same year, he held a similar role at Alexandru Macedonski's Literatorul. In 1919, N. D. Cocea hired Peltz at Chemarea and Facla newspapers; at the same time, he was an editor at Adevărul and Dimineața. During the interwar period, he had an active newspaper career, also working as an editor at Epoca, Îndreptarea, Lupta, Era nouă, Ordinea, Izbânda and Avântul, and as a contributor for the magazines Sburătorul (sporadically attending the publication's Eugen Lovinescu-led circle), Viața Românească, România Literară, Cuvântul liber, Azi, Șantier, Bilete de Papagal, Vremea, Reporter <b>and</b> Adevărul <b>literar</b> și artistic. He directed two magazines, Caiete lunare (1927) and Zodiac (1930-1932). He sometimes used the pen names I. P. Aniurg, Enter, Ipel, Logicus, I. Pajură and Rix. After World War II and with the rise of the communist regime, Peltz was an editor at the newspapers Drapelul (December 1944 - 1946) and Era nouă (1946-1948), and a contributor to România Liberă (1957-1963), Steagul roșu, Informația Bucureștiului, Munca, Gazeta literară, România Literară, Luceafărul, Veac nou, Albina, Flacăra, Pentru Patrie and Revista cultului mozaic.

5000|$|Born in Bucharest to Gheorghe Bascovitz and {{his wife}} Ecaterina, he {{attended}} Matei Basarab High School. Upon graduating in 1911, he attempted to attend the law faculty of Bucharest University, but gave up, likely due to material difficulties. Instead, he {{was hired as a}} civil servant within the Labor Ministry. Working at the social insurance office, he became department head {{near the end of his}} career. He made his poetry debut in 1906 in Ovid Densusianu's Vieața Nouă, to which he contributed constantly until 1916. His work was also published in Convorbiri critice, Literatorul, Flacăra, Sburătorul, Grădina Hesperidelor, Cugetul românesc, Revista Fundațiilor Regale, Universul <b>literar</b> <b>and</b> Gândirea. Around 1909, he was attracted to Symbolism, passionately reading Paul Verlaine, Stephane Mallarmé, Henri de Régnier, Maurice Maeterlinck and Henrik Ibsen; he particularly admired Emile Verhaeren, whom he considered a [...] "social symbolist". He considered Symbolism to be the only literary movement fit for the age. During World War I, he withdrew to Iași along with the rest of the Romanian government, and after his return to Bucharest upon the end of the war, he entered Alexandru Macedonski's circle.|$|R
