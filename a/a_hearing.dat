5|$|Temnospondyls {{and other}} early {{tetrapods}} have rounded otic notches {{in the back}} of the skull that project into the cheek region. In life, the otic notch would have been covered by a membrane called the tympanum, which is seen as a disk-like area in living frogs. The tympanum is involved in hearing, and is similar to the ear drum of more advanced tetrapods. It was traditionally thought that the tympanum developed very early in tetrapod evolution as <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> organ and progressed to form the ear drum of amniotes. Thus, temnospondyls possessed <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> system supposedly ancestral to that of living amphibians and reptiles.|$|E

Tabak, legally represented by Paul Cook, declined to request bail during <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> the following day. Tabak was moved from Bristol Prison because of fears for his safety, and was placed under suicide watch at Long Lartin Prison near Evesham. Tabak's family and friends in the Netherlands started to raise funds for his court defence.|$|E
40|$|Theories of {{semantic}} {{and pragmatic}} origins addressing contextual assignment commonly assemble a {{framework in which}} inferences are the consequence of a hearer’s discernment of which of multiple contexts are applicable to a given statement. However, such constructs fail to account for how discriminating restrictions are formed and their contributions to context formation. Thus, the model suggested herein asserts that context formation must be inference-based to allow <b>a</b> <b>hearer</b> to determine which restrictions must be placed on an applicable context for proper spoken language comprehension to occur and, therefore, originates inferences within the context formation process. ^ This thesis discusses {{the need for an}} inferential foundation within the spoken language comprehension process and emphasizes the need of any theory which attempts to account for context formation to first allow for inference-based restrictions to be formed by <b>a</b> <b>hearer.</b> <b>A</b> review of knowledge classes and their role in the inference process demonstrates how <b>a</b> <b>hearer</b> relies on her ontology and logical system to first construct the restrictions required by the world in which she experiences a statement, and an examination of the advantages provided by parametric evaluation of a statement’s proposition(s) establishes the need of <b>a</b> <b>hearer</b> to also construct restrictions on context based on the requirements {{of the world in which}} a statement is to take place. When the two assessments have been completed, <b>a</b> <b>hearer</b> may compare the two restricted worlds for the purpose of determining the possibility of their co-existence, which is the only condition for the construction of a stable context for a statement when examined within a hearer’s world. ^ In offering a model which first has the <b>hearer</b> restrict <b>a</b> contextual framework by what her world requires via the inferential system and then offering her the ability to further constrict the same framework by what a statement mandates, this thesis presents a model which is based on the inferential abilities of <b>a</b> <b>hearer</b> to form <b>a</b> context that is not somehow selected from among multiple possibilities but rather assembled as the result of restrictions which exist within the world of the hearer and the world of a statement. ...|$|R

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the rule requiring <b>a</b> fair <b>hearing</b> is broad enough to include the rule against bias since <b>a</b> fair <b>hearing</b> must be <b>an</b> unbiased <b>hearing.</b> However, the rules are often treated separately. It is fundamental to fair procedure that both sides should be heard. The right to <b>a</b> fair <b>hearing</b> requires that individuals are not penalized by decisions affecting their rights or legitimate expectations unless they have been given prior notice of the cases against them, a fair opportunity to answer them, and the opportunity to present their own cases.|$|R
5|$|After the war, on 18 March 1946, the 'double tenth' {{war crimes}} trial {{was held in}} the Supreme Court Building, before a {{military}} court presided over by Lieutenant Colonel S. C. Silkin. Twenty-one Kempeitai were accused of torturing 57 internees, resulting in the deaths of 15. On 15 April 1946, after <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> lasting 21days, Sumida was one of eight sentenced to death by hanging. Three others received life imprisonment, one a sentence of fifteen years, and two were given prison terms of eight years. Seven were acquitted.|$|E
5|$|At <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} {{his refusal to}} reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot. At the hearing, Brett said that the issue {{at the heart of}} the suit was the highway's effect on area residents. While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was not covered by the environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E
5|$|Attorney General Alfred S. Hartwell {{applied for}} the {{appointment}} of trustees shortly after Kanaʻina's death under the articles of Lunalilo's will.

5|$|By {{repeated}} scanning, bats can mentally {{construct an}} accurate {{image of the}} environment in which they are moving and of their prey item. However, some species of moth have exploited this, such as the tiger moths which produces aposematic ultrasound signals to warn bats that they are chemically protected. Other moth species can produce signals to jam bat echolocation. Many moth species have <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> organ called a tympanum, which responds to an incoming bat signal by causing the moth's flight muscles to twitch erratically, sending the moth into random evasive maneuvers.|$|E

In 1835, white settlers killed Creek chief Alibama and burned his hut in a dispute. As Justice of the Peace, Cooley jailed the settlers, but they were released due to insufficient evidence after <b>a</b> <b>hearing</b> at the Monroe County Court in Key West. The Creek people blamed Cooley, saying he withheld evidence. The growing uneasiness between the Creeks and the whites led to the Creeks' emigration to the Okeechobee area.|$|E
