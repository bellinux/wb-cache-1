Consequently, it was not long after that the first riding ploughs appeared. On these, wheels kept the plough at an <b>adjustable</b> <b>level</b> above the ground, while the ploughman sat on a seat; whereas, with earlier ploughs the ploughman would have had to walk.

40|$|We {{present a}} tunable, machine vision-based {{strategy}} for automated annotation of virtual small molecule databases. The proposed strategy {{is based on}} the use of a machine vision-based tool for extracting structure diagrams in research articles and converting them into connection tables, a virtual Chemical Expert" system for screening the converted structures based on the <b>adjustable</b> <b>levels</b> of estimated conversion accuracy, and a fragment-based measure for calculating intermolecular similarity. For annotation, calculated chemical similarity between the converted structures and entries in a virtual small molecule database is used to establish the links. The overall annotation performances can be tuned by adjusting the cutoff threshold of the estimated conversion accuracy. We perform an annotation test which attempts to link 121 journal articles registered in PubMed to entries in PubChem which is the largest, publicly accessible chemical database. Two cases of tests are performed, and their results are compared to see how the overall annotation performances are affected by the different threshold levels of the estimated accuracy of the converted structure. Our work demonstrates that over 45 % of the articles could have true positive links to entries in the PubChem database with promising recall and precision rates in both tests. Furthermore, we illustrate that the Chemical Expert system which can screen converted structures based on the <b>adjustable</b> <b>levels</b> of estimated conversion accuracy is a key factor impacting the overall annotation performance. We propose that this machine vision-based strategy can be incorporated with the text-mining approach to facilitate extraction of contextual scientific knowledge about a chemical structure, from the scientific literature...|$|R
