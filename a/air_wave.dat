The eastward stage, the one on Shooter's Hill, appeared to lift; a flash changing to a tall grey shape, a cowled figure of smoke and dust, jerked into the air. For a moment this cowled figure stood motionless, dropping huge masses of metal from its shoulders, and then it began to uncoil a dense head of smoke. The people had blown it up, aeroplane and all! As suddenly a second flash and grey shape sprang up from the Norwood stage. And even as he stared at this came a dead report; and the <b>air</b> <b>wave</b> of the first explosion struck him. He was flung up and sideways.|$|E

The Vaterland bounded like a football some one has kicked and when they looked out again, Union Square was small and remote and shattered, as though some cosmically vast giant had rolled over it. The buildings to the east of it were ablaze at a dozen points, under the flaming tatters and warping skeleton of the airship, and all the roofs and walls were ridiculously askew and crumbling as one looked.

50|$|A {{number of}} characters, heroes and villains, had {{counterparts}} on both Earth-One and Two. Generally speaking, the older Earth-Two versions were phased out or incorporated into their younger, Earth-One versions following Crisis on Infinite Earths. Several others were rebooted almost entirely, {{with their new}} versions having {{nothing in common with}} the old ones. For instance, Jim Corrigan of Earth-Two was a murdered police detective who served as the human host for the Spectre, while his Earth-One counterpart was a Metropolis police officer who often assisted Daily Planet cub reporter Jimmy Olsen and superhero Black Lightning. Many characters would often travel from one Earth to the other and interact with its natives or even immigrate. For example, Larry Jordan, the first <b>Air</b> <b>Wave</b> and native of Earth-Two, traveled to Earth-One under yet-unexplained circumstances, married Helen (the second <b>Air</b> <b>Wave)</b> and raised a son, Hal (the third <b>Air</b> <b>Wave).</b>|$|E

His next major appearance was in the JSA story arc (JSA #11-12) involving super-villain Kobra's plot to seize control of the world's media resources.

5000|$|His {{first known}} {{credited}} comic book work was the one-page filler [...] "Super Sleuths" [...] in Fox Comics' Mystery Men Comics #5 (Dec. 1939), {{near the beginning}} of the period historians and fans call the Golden Age of Comic Books. Creator credits were not routinely given during this period, making a comprehensive account of Levey's credits difficult to ascertain. However, following a story drawn for MLJ Comics in 1940, standard databases credit him as artist for a several-year on Detective Comics from the publisher National Comics, a forerunner of DC Comics. Among his first works there, he co-created the superhero <b>Air</b> <b>Wave</b> with a writer tentatively identified as either Mort Weisinger or Murray Boltinoff, the DC Comics superhero <b>Air</b> <b>Wave.</b> Levey, credited as Lee Harris, drew the character's seven- to eight-page adventures from Detective Comics #60 (Dec. 1942) to at least #74 (April 1943). At this point he left the comics industry to join the army.|$|E

50|$|At a young age, Harold {{was found}} to exhibit the power to transmute into energy. Just as his father had {{modified}} his helmet and was preparing to train him to use his powers, Larry was killed. Eventually, Harold decided {{to follow in the}} footsteps of his father's career and took up the mantle of <b>Air</b> <b>Wave.</b> When his character was introduced, it was also revealed that he was a cousin of the Green Lantern Hal Jordan, with whom he shares the name. <b>Air</b> <b>Wave</b> continued as a supporting character, though not in every issue, of Green Lantern and his co-stars of the time, Green Arrow and Black Canary, showing young Harold how to be a superhero. (Green Lantern vol. 2 #100) Starting in Action Comics #488, Hal was featured in adventures of his own. For the next couple of years, he appeared in the secondary stories of Action Comics (the cover story almost always starred Superman), often alternating with the Atom. At some point, he became able to control his transmutation to energy without relying upon his father's equipment.|$|E
