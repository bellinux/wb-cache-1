5|$|A {{number of}} plants are {{poisonous}} to guinea pigs, including bracken, bryony, buttercup, charlock, deadly nightshade, foxglove, hellebore, hemlock, lily of the valley, mayweed, monkshood, privet, ragwort, rhubarb, speedwell, toadflax (both Linaria vulgaris and Linaria dalmatica), and wild celery. Additionally, any plant which grows from <b>a</b> <b>bulb</b> (e.g., tulip or onion) is normally considered poisonous, as well as ivy and oak tree leaves.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis {{was first}} {{described}} as Agaricus muscarius β regalis by Elias Magnus Fries in his Systema Mycologicum, published in 1821. In 1887, Pier Andrea Saccardo treated it as {{a variety of}} Amanitamuscaria. Edmund Michael, in 1903, became the first to consider it a distinct species. In 1941, Jean-Edouard Gilbert suggested a complete reorganization of the genus Amanita in his world monograph of the genus, and moved it to Amanitaria as A.muscaria var. regalis. In his original (1949) version of Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy, Rolf Singer considered it a subspecies of A.muscaria, but noted {{that it may be}} regarded as a separate species; in the fourth edition (1986), he listed it as a distinct species. A.regalis is classified in a section of Amanita within the genus, a grouping of related Amanitas that have a ring on the stem (or remnants thereof), and <b>a</b> <b>bulb</b> at the base of it. More recently, a Japanese group studied the biogeography of A.muscaria and related species, and, using molecular phylogenetic analysis, concluded that the taxon should be considered a grouping of A.muscaria, rather than a distinct species. However, as of 2012, both Index Fungorum and MycoBank list the taxon as Amanita regalis.|$|E

50|$|Determining {{relative}} humidity: The percent {{relative humidity}} can be {{located at the}} intersection of the vertical dry bulb and diagonally down sloping wet bulb temperature lines. Metric (SI): Using <b>a</b> dry <b>bulb</b> of 25 °C and <b>a</b> wet <b>bulb</b> of 20 °C, read the relative humidity at approximately 63.5%. U.S/Imperial (IP): Using <b>a</b> dry <b>bulb</b> of 77 °F and <b>a</b> wet <b>bulb</b> of 68 °F, read the relative humidity at approximately 63.5%. In this example the humidity ratio is 0.0126 kg water per kg dry air.|$|R
50|$|Conversion bulbs are {{manufactured}} so {{they work with}} either a MH or HPS ballast. A grower can run <b>an</b> HPS conversion <b>bulb</b> on <b>a</b> MH ballast, or <b>a</b> MH conversion <b>bulb</b> on <b>a</b> HPS ballast. The difference between the ballasts is an HPS ballast has an igniter which ignites the sodium in <b>an</b> HPS <b>bulb,</b> while <b>a</b> MH ballast does not. Because of this, all electrical ballasts can fire MH <b>bulbs,</b> but only <b>a</b> Switchable or HPS ballast can fire <b>an</b> HPS <b>bulb</b> without <b>a</b> conversion <b>bulb.</b> Usually <b>a</b> metal halide conversion bulb {{will be used in}} an HPS ballast since the MH conversion bulbs are more common.|$|R
5|$|Tulips {{grow from}} bulbs, {{and can be}} {{propagated}} through both seeds and buds. Seeds from a tulip will form a flowering bulb after 7–12 years. When <b>a</b> <b>bulb</b> grows into the flower, the original bulb will disappear, but a clone bulb forms in its place, as do several buds. Properly cultivated, these buds will become bulbs of their own. The mosaic virus spreads only through buds, not seeds, and so cultivating the most appealing varieties takes years. Propagation is greatly slowed down by the virus. In the Northern Hemisphere, tulips bloom in April and May for about one week. During the plant's dormant phase from (Northern Hemisphere) June to September, bulbs can be uprooted and moved about, so actual purchases (in the spot market) occurred during these months. During {{the rest of the}} year, florists, or tulip traders, signed contracts before a notary to buy tulips {{at the end of the}} season (effectively futures contracts). Thus the Dutch, who developed many of the techniques of modern finance, created a market for tulip bulbs, which were durable goods. Short selling was banned by an edict of 1610, which was reiterated or strengthened in 1621 and 1630, and again in 1636. Short sellers were not prosecuted under these edicts, but their contracts were deemed unenforceable.|$|E

25|$|Amianthium {{consists}} of a single species, A. muscitotoxum, known as flypoison. It is found in eastern North America. It grows from <b>a</b> <b>bulb</b> and has a dense oval-shaped inflorescence. Individual flowers start off white and develop red-green shades with age. All parts of the plant are poisonous; two unique alkaloids, jervine and amianthine, contribute to its toxicity.|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} whether saline, sterile water, or air better maintained {{filling volume}} and diameter in a veterinary silicone Foley bulb. The bulbs of 45 8 -French silicone Foley catheters were inflated: 15 with 5 mL of sterile water (SW bulbs), 15 with 0. 9 % saline (S bulbs), and 15 with air (<b>A</b> <b>bulbs).</b> The bulbs were submerged in 30 mL of synthetic urine in a 50 mL conical tube in a 38 °C water bath. Five catheters from each group were removed on days 3, 5, and 10 to measure bulb volume and diameter. On days 3 and 5, volume and diameter of SW or S bulbs were {{significantly greater than}} those of <b>A</b> <b>bulbs,</b> but {{were not significantly different}} from one another. At day 10, only 1 S bulb remained intact, 4 of the 5 SW bulbs were intact, the average volume of the SW bulbs was 2. 8 mL, and the <b>A</b> <b>bulbs</b> were all deflated. We conclude that sterile water and 0. 9 % saline are both acceptable for Foley bulb inflation of 5 d or less, but sterile water might be preferred if bulb inflation must be maintained for more than 5 d...|$|R

25|$|For {{the average}} user, UV {{radiation}} from indoor lights {{does not appear}} to be a concern. For those with skin sensitivity long term indoor exposure may be a concern, in which case they may want to use <b>a</b> <b>bulb</b> with lower UV radiation output.

25|$|The Sondhauss Tube {{is one of}} {{the early}} thermal tone generators; it was {{discovered}} in the glass blowing industry. <b>A</b> <b>bulb</b> with hot air is connected to one end of a tube that is at room temperature. When the cold tube is blown, tube acoustic oscillations occur. It was discussed by Baron Rayleigh in his Theory of Sound. This device is not considered a true whistle since the oscillations decay as the temperatures equalize.|$|E
25|$|A further {{development}} of the tungsten-halogen bulb has a dichroic coating that passes visible light and reflects infrared radiation. The glass in such <b>a</b> <b>bulb</b> may be spherical or tubular. The reflected infrared radiation strikes the filament located at {{the centre of the}} glass envelope, heating the filament to a greater degree than can be achieved through resistive heating alone. The superheated filament emits more light without an increase in power consumption.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "Ilyich's lamp" [...] (лампочка Ильича) for <b>an</b> {{electric}} <b>bulb,</b> <b>a</b> {{reference to}} Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, {{is a reminder}} of the Plan period.|$|R
50|$|For another example, when <b>a</b> light <b>bulb</b> with <b>a</b> {{power rating}} of 100 watts {{is turned on}} for one hour, the energy used is 100 watt hours (W⋅h), which is equal to 0.1 {{kilowatt}} hours. This same amount of energy would light <b>a</b> 50-watt <b>bulb</b> for 2 hours, <b>a</b> 40-watt <b>bulb</b> for 2.5 hours, or <b>a</b> 10-watt <b>bulb</b> for 10 hours. A power station's electricity output at any particular moment would be measured in multiples of watts, but its annual energy sales would be in multiples of watt hours. A kilowatt hour {{is the amount of}} energy equivalent to a steady power of 1 kilowatt running for 1 hour, or 3.6 megajoules.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> neon <b>bulb,</b> {{often used}} as an {{indicator}} lamp in appliances, consists of <b>a</b> glass <b>bulb</b> containing two electrodes, separated by an inert gas such as neon at low pressure. Its nonlinear current-voltage characteristics (diagram below) allow it {{to function as a}} switching device.|$|R
25|$|Lamp power also {{influences}} colour in tungsten lamps. As {{the lamp}} power is decreased, the tungsten filament in <b>a</b> <b>bulb</b> {{will tend to}} produce increasing percentages of orange light, {{as compared to the}} nearly white light emitted at full power. This is known as amber drift or amber shift. Thus a 1000-watt instrument at 50 percent power will emit a higher percentage of orange light than a 500-watt instrument operating at full power.|$|E
25|$|The first dual-filament {{halogen bulb}} to produce both a low {{and a high}} beam, the H4 (60/55W @ 12V, 1650/1000lm ±15% @ 13.2V), was {{released}} in 1971 and quickly became the predominant headlamp bulb throughout the world except in the United States, where the H4 is still not legal for automotive use. In 1992, the Americans created their own standard for <b>a</b> <b>bulb</b> called HB2: almost identical to H4 except with more stringent constraints on filament geometry and positional variance, and power consumption and light output expressed at the US test voltage of 12.8V.|$|E
25|$|An {{anchored}} {{retaining wall}} {{can be constructed}} {{in any of the}} aforementioned styles but also includes additional strength using cables or other stays anchored in the rock or soil behind it. Usually driven into the material with boring, anchors are then expanded {{at the end of the}} cable, either by mechanical means or often by injecting pressurized concrete, which expands to form <b>a</b> <b>bulb</b> in the soil. Technically complex, this method is very useful where high loads are expected, or where the wall itself has to be slender and would otherwise be too weak.|$|E

25|$|In 1850 Swan {{began working}} on <b>a</b> light <b>bulb</b> using {{carbonized}} paper filaments in <b>an</b> evacuated glass <b>bulb.</b> By 1860 {{he was able to}} demonstrate a working device, and obtained a British patent covering a partial vacuum, carbon filament incandescent lamp. However, the lack of a good vacuum and an adequate electric source resulted in <b>an</b> inefficient light <b>bulb</b> with <b>a</b> short lifetime.|$|R
25|$|On 13 December 1904, Hungarian Sándor Just and Croatian Franjo Hanaman {{were granted}} a Hungarian patent (No. 34541) for a {{tungsten}} filament lamp that lasted longer and gave brighter light than the carbon filament. Tungsten filament lamps were first marketed by the Hungarian company Tungsram in 1904. This type {{is often called}} Tungsram-bulbs in many European countries. Filling <b>a</b> <b>bulb</b> with an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen retards the evaporation of the tungsten filament compared to operating it in a vacuum. This allows for greater temperatures and therefore greater efficacy with less reduction in filament life.|$|E
25|$|Schoenocaulon is a genus {{of around}} 25 species. The precise number is unclear; two species were only {{discovered}} in 2008, and many occur only in remote regions of Mexico, where their montane forest habitat is under threat.

25|$|In 1872, Russian Alexander Lodygin invented an {{incandescent}} light bulb and obtained a Russian patent in 1874. He used as a burner two carbon rods of diminished section in a glass receiver, hermetically sealed, and filled with nitrogen, electrically arranged so that the current could be passed to the second carbon when the first had been consumed. Later {{he lived in the}} US, changed his name to Alexander de Lodyguine and applied and obtained patents for incandescent lamps having chromium, iridium, rhodium, ruthenium, osmium, molybdenum and tungsten filaments, and <b>a</b> <b>bulb</b> using a molybdenum filament was demonstrated at the world fair of 1900 in Paris.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} the {{electrodes}} is the key part: These are rod-like structures usually made of glass, with <b>a</b> <b>bulb</b> containing the sensor at the bottom. The glass electrode for measuring the pH has a glass bulb specifically designed to be selective to hydrogen-ion concentration. On immersion in the solution to be tested, hydrogen ions in the test solution exchange for other positively charged ions on the glass bulb, creating an electrochemical potential across the bulb. The electronic amplifier detects the difference in electrical potential between the two electrodes generated in the measurement and converts the potential difference to pH units. The magnitude of the electrochemical potential across the glass bulb is linearly related to the pH according to the Nernst equation.|$|E
25|$|The minaret is {{situated}} at the southern corner of the facade looking into Bab al-Wazir Street, affording a dominant view of the entire {{southern part of the}} street. It consists of three stories, the first being circular and plain and the second circular and ribbed while the top story is <b>a</b> <b>bulb</b> resting on a pavilion supported by eight slender stone columns. Its circular shaft is rare among Mamluk minarets. Prior to its 20th-century restoration, the minaret had four stories. The third story was octagonal and removed during the restoration, depriving the Aqsunqur Mosque a unique feature it shared with another mosque in Cairo, the Sultan al-Ghuri Complex which has four stories. The Aqsunqur Mosque minaret was featured in several 19th-century illustrations.|$|E
25|$|The {{light source}} {{to be used}} should be small and bright. The best shadows come from light {{proceeding}} from the smallest possible point. Albert Almoznino suggests a candle, a flashlight (with the lens and reflector removed) or any very small light. If <b>a</b> <b>bulb</b> is used, it should be clear. J. C. Cannell suggests in his book, Modern Conjuring For Amateurs, that the best source of light is the electric arc, which Almoznino agrees to the small arc lamp, and the second best being the limelight (if used with a high-class jet). Trewey suggests the chalk for the limelight to be cut in a triangular form, or else it will produce a gray border around the shadow. Cannell states another favorite amongst shadowgraphists {{is the use of}} acetylene gas (i.e. acetylene gas lamp or carbide lamp). Nowadays it is possible to use a single lensless (for example, SMD) LED.|$|E
