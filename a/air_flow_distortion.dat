40|$|Parameterisation of the air-sea gas {{transfer}} velocity of CO 2 and other trace gases under open-ocean conditions {{has been a}} focus of air-sea interaction research and is required for accurately determining ocean carbon uptake. Ships are {{the most widely used}} platform for air-sea flux measurements but the quality of the data can be compromised by <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>distortion</b> and sensor cross-sensitivity effects. Recent improvements in the understanding of these effects have led to enhanced corrections to the shipboard eddy covariance (EC) measurements. Here we present a revised analysis of eddy covariance measurements of air-sea CO 2 and momentum fluxes from the Southern Ocean Surface Ocean Aerosol Production study (SOAP). We show {{that it is possible to}} significantly reduce the scatter in the EC data and achieve consistency between measurements taken on-station and with the ship underway. The {{gas transfer}} velocities from the EC measurements correlate better with the EC friction velocity (u *) than with mean wind speeds derived from shipboard measurements corrected with an <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>distortion</b> model. For the observed range of wind speeds (u 10 N  =  3 – 23  m s − 1), the transfer velocities can be parameterised with a linear fit to u *. The SOAP data are compared to previous gas transfer parameterisations using u 10 N computed from the EC friction velocity with the drag coefficient from the COARE model. The SOAP results are consistent with previous gas transfer studies, but at high wind speeds they do not support the sharp increase in gas transfer associated with bubble-mediated transfer predicted by physically based models...|$|E

40|$|In {{the design}} of a modern natural draught wet-cooling tower, {{structural}} and performance characteristics must be considered. <b>Air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>distortions</b> and resistances must be minimised to achieve optimal cooling which requires that the cooling towers must be modelled two-dimensionally and ultimately three-dimensionally to be optimized. It is found that CFD models in literature are limited to counterflow cooling towers packed with film fills which are porous in one direction only and generally have a high pressure drop, as well as purely crossflow cooling towers packed with splash fill, which simplifies the analysis considerably. Many counterflow cooling towers are however packed with trickle and splash fills which have anisotropic flow resistances, which means the fills are porous in all flow directions and thus <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> can be oblique through the fill, particularly near the cooling tower air inlet. This provides a challenge since available fill test facilities and subsequently fill performance characteristics are limited to purely counter- and crossflow configuration. This paper presents a CFD model to predict the performance of natural draught wet-cooling tower with any type of fill configuration, which can be used to investigate the effects of different atmospheric temperature distributions, air inlet and outlet geometries, air inlet heights, variations in radial water loading and fill depth, fill configurations, rain zone drop size distributions, and spray zone performance characteristics on cooling tower performance for optimization purposes. Furthermore the effects of damage or removal of fill in annular sections and boiler flue gas discharge in the centre of the tower can be investigated. The fill performance characteristics for oblique <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> are determined by linear interpolation between counter- and crossflow fill characteristics in terms of the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> angle.

40|$|Direct {{measurements}} of marine DMS fluxes are sparse, {{particularly in the}} Southern Ocean. The Surface Ocean Aerosol Production (SOAP) voyage in February–March 2012 examined the distribution and flux of dimethylsulfide (DMS) in a biologically-active frontal system in the southwest Pacific Ocean. Three distinct phytoplankton blooms were studied with oceanic DMS concentrations as high as 25  nmol L − 1. Measurements of DMS fluxes were made using two independent methods: the eddy covariance (EC) technique using API-CIMS chemical ionization mass spectrometry, and the gradient flux technique (GF) from an autonomous catamaran platform. Catamaran flux measurements are relatively unaffected by <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>distortion</b> and are made close to the water surface where gas gradients are largest. Flux measurements were complemented by near-surface hydrographic measurements to elucidate physical factors influencing DMS emission. Individual DMS fluxes derived by EC showed significant scatter and, at times, consistent departures from the COARE gas exchange parameterization. A direct comparison between the two flux methods was carried out to separate instrumental effects from environmental effects, and showed good agreement with a regression slope of 0. 96 (r 2  =  0. 89). A period of abnormal downward atmospheric heat flux enhanced near-surface ocean stratification and reduced turbulent exchange, during which GF and EC transfer velocities showed good agreement but modelled COAREG values were significantly higher. The transfer velocity derived from near surface ocean turbulence measurements on a spar buoy compared well with the COAREG model in general, but showed less variation. This first direct comparison between EC and GF fluxes of DMS provides confidence in compilation of flux estimates from both techniques, {{and also in the}} stable periods when the observations are not well-predicted by the COAREG model...|$|E

Gas transfer velocities estimated using wind speed dependent parameterisations may be in error due to <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>distortion</b> by the ship's hull and superstructure introducing biases into the measured wind speed. The effect of airflow distortion on estimates of the transfer velocity was examined by modelling the airflow around the three-dimensional geometries of the research vessels Hakuho Maru and Mirai, using the Large Eddy Simulation code GERRIS. For airflows within ± 45 ° of the bow the maximum bias was + 16 %. For wind speed of 10 m s − 1 to 15 m s − 1, a + 16 % bias in wind speed would cause an overestimate in the calculated value of k of 30 % to 50 %, depending on which k parameterisation is used. This is due to the propagation of errors when using quadratic or cubic parameterizations. Recommendations for suitable anemometer locations on research vessels are given. The errors in transfer velocity may be much larger for typical merchant ships, as the anemometers are generally not as well-exposed as those on research vessels. Flow distortion may also introduce biases in the wind speed dependent k parameterizations themselves, since these are obtained by relating measurements of the CO 2 flux to measurements of the wind speed and the CO 2 concentration difference. To investigate this, flow distortion effects were estimated for three different platforms from which wind speed dependent parameterizations are published. The estimates ranged from – 4 % to + 14 % and showed that flow distortion may {{have a significant impact on}} wind speed dependent parameterizations. However, the wind biases are not large enough to explain the differences at high wind speeds in parameterizations which are based on eddy covariance and deliberate tracer methods...|$|E

40|$|Anemometers on Voluntary Observing Ships (VOS) {{are usually}} located above the bridge {{in a region}} where the effects of <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> <b>distortion,</b> created by the {{presence}} of the ship, may be large. Until now it was not known whether measurements from such anemometers would be biased high or low, and the possible magnitude of any such bias was not known. Investigations into the airflow above merchant ships have been carried out experimentally using a low-speed wind tunnel and numerically using a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code VECTIS. The investigations examined the airflow over simple block models of VOS shapes. The results of the investigations were compared to wind speed measurements made from the RRS Charles Darwin. Experimental and CFD techniques have been used to devise scaling rules that predict the effects of the flow distortion. Both techniques have shown that the pattern of the flow distortion above the bridge scales with the ‘step height’, H, of the model. In the case of a tanker, H is the ‘bridge to deck’ height, i. e. the height of the accommodation block above the deck, for bow-on flows. Close {{to the top of the}} bridge the flow is severely decelerated and may even reverse in direction. Using the upwind edge of the bridge as the origin of the scaled co-ordinate system, there is a definite line above the decelerated region along which the speed of the flow is equal to the undistorted wind speed. Above this ‘line of equality’ the wind speed increases to a maximum and then decreases with increased height to a free stream wind speed. Simple equations have been devised to predict the positions of the ‘line of equality’, the maximum wind speed and the minimum wind speed within the decelerated region. Comparisons of the results with wind speed data obtained from field measurements made using a number of anemometers located on the RRS Charles Darwin agreed well and have predicted a maximum wind speed increase of approximately 15 ± 5 %. Comparisons with the field data have confirmed that CFD models can be used to predict the effects of airflow distortion above merchant ships. The investigation has demonstrated the ability of the wind tunnel and CFD approaches employed to provide a better understanding of the airflow over merchant ships. Both methods have contributed to improve the understanding of how the wind speed at anemometer sites on merchant ships is affected by the ships hull and superstructure. <br/...|$|E

On-blade pressure transducers were used to measure the unsteady blade surface pressure. These pressures and the resulting transient load on the rotor blades were compared to the numerical prediction.

Key words: spunbonding, <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> field, conduit parameter...|$|R
40|$|Laminar <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> {{isolation}} and decontamination procedures were evaluated in a prospective randomized study {{in patients with}} aplastic anemia or acute leukemia undergoing marrow transplantation from HLA-matched siblings. Patients transplanted in the laminar <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> group had significantly less septicemia and major local infections than did patients in the control group. Nineteen of 46 laminar <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> patients and six of 44 control patients are alive at present. In patients with aplastic anemia the survival was 13 of 17 in the laminar <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> group compared with four of 17 in the control group. In patients with acute leukemia the survival was six of 29 in the laminar <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> group versus two of 27 in the control group. These differences were not statistically significant. Death in both the laminar <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> and control groups was predominantly due to interstitial pneumonitis or recurren...|$|R

In this paper, the diaphragm’s Mechanical {{property}} of Hot-film <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> sensor is studied {{on the base}} of proposition of double-sided convection heat <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> sensor. This diaphragm consists of barrier layer, support layer and passivation layer. For Hot-film <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> sensor, the Diaphragm’s Mechanical property is mainly up to the support layer, and the support layer is composed of Si 3 N 4. In this research, four types of <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> sensors with different thickness of the support layer is prepared and tested at different <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> velocity. On the same time, the stress analysis of the sensor diaphragm is simulated at the flow rate of 5 m/s by the finite element software. A conclusion can be drawn that the thickness of support layer can not be less than 1000 nm, when the <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> velocity is more than 5 m/s...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the parameters that affect the drying process of wood chips at low <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> conditions. This objective was determined by measuring the air pressure resistance being produced by wood chips by examining different variables such as: <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> rate, <b>air</b> velocity, wood chip size, bulk density, bulk height and porosity. The <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> resistance was measured inside a 3 meter high cylindrical air duct constructed at University of Hohenheim. Physical properties of two different Spruce wood chip fractions were analyzed and their characteristics were considered on fitting the model expression. The analysed model expresses the physical behaviour of <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> resistance. Statistical analyses show high correlation of air speed versus <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> resistance. The model could be used for determination of drying conditions with low <b>air</b> mass <b>flow.</b> The height of bulk density according <b>air</b> mass <b>flow</b> generated or the necessary <b>air</b> mass <b>flow</b> needed for transporting air through the bulk height...|$|R
