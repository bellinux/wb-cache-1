5|$|By 1812, {{advisers}} to Alexander suggested {{the possibility of}} <b>an</b> <b>invasion</b> of the French Empire and the recapture of Poland. On receipt of intelligence reports on Russia's war preparations, Napoleon expanded his Grande Armée to more than 450,000 men. He ignored repeated advice against <b>an</b> <b>invasion</b> of the Russian heartland and prepared for an offensive campaign; on 24 June 1812 the invasion commenced.|$|E

5|$|Despite Australian fears, the Japanese never {{intended}} to invade the Australian mainland. While <b>an</b> <b>invasion</b> was considered by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters in February 1942, it was judged to be beyond the Japanese military's capabilities and no planning or other preparations were undertaken. Instead, in March 1942 the Japanese military adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing Port Moresby in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa and New Caledonia. This plan was frustrated by the Japanese defeat in the Battle of the Coral Sea and was postponed indefinitely after the Battle of Midway. While these battles ended the threat to Australia, the Australian government continued to warn that <b>an</b> <b>invasion</b> was possible until mid-1943.|$|E

5|$|In October 1943, General Hansell was {{appointed}} {{chief of the}} Combined and Joint Staff Division, in the Office of the Assistant Chief of Air Staff for Plans, located at Headquarters USAAF. As such he became Air Planner on the Joint Planning Staff. He immediately affected planning of strategic air attacks on Japan. The JPS draft outline denigrated strategic bombing and declared that <b>an</b> <b>invasion</b> of the home islands was {{the only means of}} defeating Japan, but Hansell successfully argued that <b>an</b> <b>invasion</b> should only be a contingency if bombing and a sea blockade of Japan failed to compel a surrender.|$|E

5|$|On 3 June, Spain was {{approached}} by the US ambassador with a request to use Spanish ports for evacuating the wounded, following landings in southern France. Originally the plan had been to request access {{for the purposes of}} staging the initial invasion. However, this was toned down in light of historical resistance to any foreign occupation of Spanish soil as well as the implausibility of invading France via the Pyrenees. On 5 June the British ambassador reinforced the request, and after some discussion the Spanish government agreed but only after <b>an</b> <b>invasion</b> had occurred, and {{under the supervision of the}} Red Cross. To emphasise the change in objective, the Allies followed this up with Operation Ferdinand which threatened <b>an</b> <b>invasion</b> in Italy.|$|E

50|$|The last extant {{inscription}} of Govindachandra is dated 1154 CE, and {{the earliest}} available inscription of his successor Vijayachandra is dated 1168 CE. Such a long gap is {{unusual for the}} dynasty, and may indicate troubled times arising out of <b>an</b> external <b>invasion</b> or <b>a</b> war of succession after Govindachandra's death. Vijayachandra faced <b>a</b> Ghaznavid <b>invasion,</b> which {{he seems to have}} repulsed sometime before 1164 CE. His focus on guarding the eastern frontiers against the Ghaznavids may have led to the neglect of the kingdom's western border, which later resulted in <b>a</b> Sena <b>invasion.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Allies {{had already}} decided to mount <b>an</b> <b>invasion</b> of {{southern}} France (Dragoon), which occurred in August 1944. Vendetta's story was agreed {{in the first week}} of May and deception work started on 9 May. Its aim was to detain German forces in Southern France for up to twenty five days following the Normandy landings. The plan threatened a landing near Sete (chosen for its distance from the Dragoon landing site) by the US Seventh Army, consisting of fictional divisions, and some French units. Vendetta was supported by a diplomatic deception, Operation Royal Flush, which requested support from the Spanish government to allow injured soldiers to be evacuated following <b>an</b> <b>invasion.</b>|$|E

Under the Tenth Army, IX Corps was assigned two missions. In 1944, it was primarily concerned with formulating plans for <b>an</b> <b>invasion</b> of the coastal regions of Japanese-held China. Later in 1944 and early 1945, it was placed in charge of preparing the rest of the Tenth Army for movement to Okinawa {{in preparation for}} <b>an</b> <b>invasion</b> of the island, which was launched in April 1945.|$|E

Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 August and 9 August respectively. With <b>an</b> <b>invasion</b> of the Japanese archipelago imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, Japan formally surrendered on 2 September 1945.
