5|$|Commander Keen in Aliens <b>Ate</b> <b>My</b> Babysitter is {{the final}} id-developed game, {{released}} in December 1991 for MS-DOS. Originally planned to be the third episode of Goodbye, Galaxy and sixth episode overall, it was changed before development began to be a stand-alone game—stylized as Commander Keen in Aliens <b>Ate</b> <b>My</b> Babysitter!—published as a retail title through FormGen. Due to differing timelines between FormGen and Apogee, despite being numbered as the sixth episode it was developed in between the fourth and fifth; it also features a modified engine from Goodbye, Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Commander Keen in Aliens <b>Ate</b> <b>My</b> Babysitter (stylized as Aliens <b>Ate</b> <b>My</b> Babysitter!) is a side-scrolling {{platform}} {{video game}} developed by id Software {{and published by}} FormGen in December 1991 for MS-DOS. It is the seventh episode of the Commander Keen series, though it is numbered as the sixth, as Commander Keen in Keen Dreams is outside of the main continuity. The game follows the titular Commander Keen, an eight-year-old child genius, as he journeys through an alien world to rescue his kidnapped babysitter. The game feature Keen running, jumping, and shooting through various levels while opposed by aliens, robots, and other hazards.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Goodbye, Galaxy and Aliens <b>Ate</b> <b>My</b> Babysitter in 1991, id Software planned to make a third set of episodes for the {{following}} December, titled Commander Keen in The Universe is Toast!. Beyond the proposed title and release date, shown in the epilogue of the two games, no design work was completed before the game was cancelled due {{to the success of}} id's Wolfenstein 3D (1992) and development focus on 3D first-person shooters such as Doom (1993). John Carmack noted in 1999, when referencing the project that became the Game Boy Color game, that the original developers of Keen were unlikely to ever work together again on another game.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{the team}} {{believed}} {{that they would be}} unable to use the Wolfenstein name due to trademark issues, and came up with multiple possible titles, only to discover that the original developer, Muse Software, had gone out of business several years earlier and let the trademark lapse, leaving them the option to use the name Wolfenstein 3D. The game concept met with immediate approval from Scott Miller of Apogee, who considered id Software his star developer, and he paid id a US$100,000 advance on the project. Mark Rein, who had been brought on a few months prior as id's probationary president, also sold the idea of doing a retail Wolfenstein project to FormGen, which had published id's December 1991 Commander Keen in Aliens <b>Ate</b> <b>My</b> Babysitter, overcoming the publisher's concerns over Wolfensteins proposed content. This put id in the unique position of selling simultaneously to the shareware and retail markets.|$|E
5|$|Commander Keen in Aliens <b>Ate</b> <b>My</b> Babysitter is a side-scrolling {{platform}} video game: {{the majority}} of the game features the player-controlled Commander Keen viewed from the side while moving on a two-dimensional plane. The player can move left and right and can jump, and can use a pogo stick to bounce continuously and jump higher than they can normally with the correct timing. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, viewed from slightly above. Some platforms allow Keen to jump up through them from below, while others feature fireman's poles that Keen can climb up or down. Keen can also grab onto the edge of platforms and pull himself up. There are giant switches which must be jumped up into or dropped onto to flip which have effects on the gameworld, such as retracting and extending gates or initiate moving platforms. Once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, though the player can save their game at any point. Between levels, the player travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance or save their progress in the game. Some levels are optional to enter and may be bypassed, while portions of the map are gated off until specific levels are completed.|$|E
5|$|Id Software did {{not produce}} any more games in the Commander Keen series after Goodbye Galaxy besides the co-developed Aliens <b>Ate</b> <b>My</b> Babysitter. Another trilogy of episodes, titled The Universe Is Toast, was planned for December 1992, but was {{cancelled}} after the success of id's Wolfenstein 3D and development focus on Doom. A final Keen game, Commander Keen, was developed for the Game Boy Color in 2001 by David A. Palmer Productions in association with id Software, and published by Activision. Goodbye Galaxy has been released as part of several collections since its first release: the id Anthology compilation in 1996, a compilation release by Apogee in 1998 of Invasion of the Vorticons and Goodbye, Galaxy, a similar compilation in 2001 by 3D Realms titled Commander Keen Combo CD, and the 3D Realms Anthology in 2014. They have also been released for modern computers through a DOS emulator, and sold through Steam since 2007 {{as a part of}} the Commander Keen Complete Pack. According to Steam Spy, as of June 2016 approximately 200,000 copies have been sold through Steam.|$|E

5|$|The Commander Keen series {{began in}} 1990 when John Carmack, then a game {{programmer}} at Softdisk, {{came up with}} a method to produce scrolling graphics for a 2D platform video game on IBM-compatible general-purpose computers. After a demo port of Super Mario Bros. 3 failed to entice Nintendo, he and a group of his coworkers from Softdisk—including programmer John Romero, designer Tom Hall, and artist Adrian Carmack—used the technique to make an original trilogy of shareware episodes for publisher Apogee Software. The game, Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, was a large success for the market, and led the group to quit their jobs and found id Software. The game was followed by four more episodes during 1991: Keen Dreams, a pair titled Goodbye, Galaxy, and Aliens <b>Ate</b> <b>My</b> Babysitter. Further plans were made for another trilogy to be produced in 1992 under the name The Universe is Toast, but before any work began it was cancelled due to the success of id's Wolfenstein 3D and development focus on Doom. Id did not return to the series afterwards, instead continuing to focus on 3D first-person shooters.|$|E
5|$|The levels {{contain a}} variety of enemies, which the player must stun, destroy, or avoid; these are {{primarily}} different alien creatures. Levels can also include hazards, such as spikes or fire; touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen to lose a life, and the game is ended if all of Keen's lives are lost. The game features three difficulty settings, which change the number and types of enemies present. While the raygun in Vorticons killed enemies, and the stun gun in Goodbye, Galaxy and Aliens <b>Ate</b> <b>My</b> Babysitter permanently stunned them, Keen's Neural Ray Blaster in this game only temporarily stuns enemies, who must then be jumped on with the pogo stick to be killed or destroyed. Stunned enemies can be bypassed until they wake up again, and unlike prior games the blaster does not require collectible ammo, though only one shot can be fired at a time. The player can also find food items throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded with enough points. There are also items which award an extra life once enough have been collected, colored keycard gems which grant access to locked parts of levels, and items which instantly grant an extra life.|$|E

[...] "Monster" [...] has a basic sequence of F–G–Am–Em as its chord progression. Lyrically, [...] "Monster" [...] contains zombie-like metaphors about having one's heart eaten. The song also features references to [...] "Just Dance", Gaga's debut single, with the line [...] "I wanna ‘Just Dance’/ But he took me home instead". Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH believed that the lines in the last verse [...] "get a bit gruesome at the end" [...] with the lines saying [...] "He tore my clothes right off/ He <b>ate</b> <b>my</b> heart and then he <b>ate</b> <b>my</b> brain." ...|$|E
500|$|Fans of Day of the Tentacle {{created a}} webcomic, The Day After the Day of the Tentacle, using the game's graphics. The 1993 LucasArts title Zombies <b>Ate</b> <b>My</b> Neighbors {{features}} a stage dedicated to Day of the Tentacle. The artists for Day of the Tentacle shared office space with the Zombies <b>Ate</b> <b>My</b> Neighbors development team. The team included the homage after frequently seeing artwork for Day of the Tentacle {{during the two}} games' productions. In describing what he considered [...] "the most rewarding moment" [...] of his career, Grossman stated that the game's writing and use of spoken and subtitled dialog assisted a learning-disabled child in learning how to read. Telltale Games CEO Dan Connors commented in 2009 that an episodic game based on Day of the Tentacle would be [...] "feasible". However, he cautioned that such an endeavor would hinge on the sales of the Monkey Island titles released that year.|$|E
500|$|Also in August 1991, {{the team}} moved from Shreveport to Hall's {{hometown}} of Madison, Wisconsin, leaving behind Wilbur, who {{was unwilling to}} leave a stable job at Softdisk to fully join in with the startup, but picking up programmer Jason Blochowiak, who {{was working at the}} time at Softdisk. There, they worked on Goodbye, Galaxy, their remaining Softdisk games, and the now standalone Commander Keen in Aliens <b>Ate</b> <b>My</b> Babysitter between August and December. Despite being listed numerically as the sixth episode, due to it having a different publisher and schedule Aliens <b>Ate</b> <b>My</b> Babysitter was developed after [...] "Secret of the Oracle" [...] but before [...] "The Armageddon Machine"; the fifth episode, however, was created within one month.

Ben Patashnik from NME {{felt that it was}} [...] "slightly too disposable". Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork saw similarities between Gaga's voice on [...] "Monster" [...] and the work of Kylie Minogue. Brian Linder from IGN felt that the track was lighter compared to the other songs on The Fame Monster, and complimented the line [...] "We French kissed on a subway train / He tore my clothes right off / He <b>ate</b> <b>my</b> heart and then he <b>ate</b> <b>my</b> brain", calling it a lyrical gem.

500|$|Also in August 1991, {{the team}} moved from Shreveport to Hall's {{hometown}} of Madison, Wisconsin, leaving behind Wilbur, who {{was unwilling to}} leave a stable job at Softdisk to fully join in with the startup, but picking up programmer Jason Blochowiak, who {{was working at the}} time at Softdisk and living at the same house as John Carmack and Wilbur. Once there, the team worked out of a three-bedroom apartment, with John Carmack living in one of the bedrooms. There, they worked on Goodbye, Galaxy, their remaining Softdisk games, and the now standalone Commander Keen in Aliens <b>Ate</b> <b>My</b> Babysitter between August and December. A software catalog released by Apogee in June initially listed the game as planned for September 21, 1991, but this release date was not followed. As it grew colder, they increasingly spent all of their time in the apartment, making the games and designing a game that would later become Wolfenstein 3D.
