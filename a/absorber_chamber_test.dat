A solar collector (4) is fixed {{to the outer wall}} of a building (1) and is operated with air as the heat conveyor.

40|$|A {{model for}} {{predicting}} {{the rate at}} which a volatile organic compound (VOC) is emitted from a diffusion-controlled material is validated for three contaminants (n-pentadecane, n-tetradecane, and phenol) found in vinyl flooring (VF). Model parameters are the initial VOC concentration in the material-phase (C 0), the material/air partition coefficient (K), and the material-phase diffusion coefficient (D). The model was verified by comparing predicted gas-phase concentrations to data obtained during small-scale <b>chamber</b> <b>tests,</b> and by comparing predicted material-phase concentrations to those measured {{at the conclusion of the}} <b>chamber</b> <b>tests.</b> <b>Chamber</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted with the VF placed top side up and bottom side up. With the exception of phenol, and within the limits of experimental precision, the mass of VOCs recovered in the gas phase balances the mass emitted from the material phase. The model parameters (C 0, K, and D) were measured using procedures that were completely independent of the <b>chamber</b> <b>test.</b> Gas- and material-phase predictions compare well to the bottom-side-up chamber data. The lower emission rates for the top-side-up orientation may be explained by the presence of a low-permeability surface layer.

40|$|<b>Chamber</b> <b>tests</b> {{are usually}} used to {{determine}} the source characteristics of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) which are critical to quantify indoor exposure to SVOCs. In contrast to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the sorption effect of SVOCs to chamber surfaces usually needs to be considered due to the much higher surface/air partition coefficients, resulting in a long time to reach steady state, frequently on the order of months, and complicating the mathematical analysis of the resulting data. A <b>chamber</b> <b>test</b> is also complicated if the material-phase concentration is not constant. This study shows how to design a chamber to overcome these limitations. A dimensionless mass transfer analysis is used to specify conditions for (1) neglecting the SVOC sorption effect to chamber surfaces, (2) neglecting the convective mass transfer resistance at sorption surfaces if the sorption effect cannot be neglected, and (3) regarding the material-phase concentration in the source as constant. Several practical and quantifiable ways to improve chamber design are proposed. The approach is illustrated by analyzing available data from three different chambers in terms of the accuracy with which the model parameters can be determined and the time needed to conduct the <b>chamber</b> <b>test.</b> The results should greatly facilitate the design of chambers to characterize SVOC emissions and the resulting exposure...|$|R
