5|$|Among {{the oldest}} of Britain's battleships at the time, Magnificent was <b>a</b> <b>guard</b> ship on the Humber when World War I broke out. She was then, {{together}} with her sister ship , assigned to Scapa Flow as <b>a</b> <b>guard</b> ship. In 1915, she was stripped of her main armament, and later in that year was converted to a troopship {{for use in the}} Dardanelles Campaign. Returning to England in 1916, she was inactive until late 1917, at which time she was converted to an ammunition ship. She continued to serve in this role until 1921, at which time she was decommissioned before being scrapped the following year.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTwo {{standard}} test methods exist to experimentally determine the effective thermal resistance of a wall: in-situ testing to calibrate a computer simulation and steady-state testing in <b>a</b> <b>guarded</b> hot box. This paper compares results obtained using both methods {{on a wall}} assembly incorporating vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) with an experimentally determined effective R-Value of 8. 21 m 2 K/W using <b>a</b> <b>guarded</b> hot box. The result using <b>a</b> <b>guarded</b> hot box was lower than that using in-situ measurements paired with computer simulation {{as a result of}} the more accurate representation of thermal bridging between VIP panels using this test method. When testing in <b>a</b> <b>guarded</b> hot box, all thermal bridges, including between panels is accounted for. By comparison, an experimentally obtained thermal resistance measured at the center of a VIP panel and assumed as a constant thermal resistance across the complete VIP layer in the computer model does not account for the non-homogenous nature of a VIP layer. As a result, it was concluded that wall assemblies that contain numerous small thermal bridges like those incorporating VIP panels should be experimentally evaluated using <b>a</b> <b>guarded</b> box...|$|R

Hannover was used as <b>a</b> <b>guard</b> ship in the Danish belt, and Schlesien became a training ship in Kiel. Guns removed from these ships starting in 1917 were used by the Imperial Army in World War I as railway guns.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war in May, Blitz was {{stationed}} as <b>a</b> <b>guard</b> ship in the Elbe, primarily in Glückstadt, where a large number of French prisoners of war were being transferred back to France. In July, Blitz became a fishery protection ship; though the duty was generally uneventful, in one case she had to fire a warning shot toward a British fishing vessel to force the crew to recognize German sovereignty. In late July, Blitz steamed to the island of Sylt, where Kronprinz (Crown Prince) Frederick, his wife Kronprinzessin (Crown Princess) Victoria, and their two sons, Wilhelm and Heinrich came aboard for a fishing trip. From 7 October 1871 to June 1872, Blitz {{was stationed}} as <b>a</b> <b>guard</b> ship in Altona, and on 26 June she began another stint as a fishery protection ship. While Blitz was patrolling in the northern North Sea on 29 June, one of her masts broke, forcing her to put into Aberdeen, Scotland for repairs. The crew's unfamiliarity with tidal conditions in Aberdeen nearly caused the boat to run aground. On 5 July, Blitz was ready to depart for the Shetland Islands, and she arrived in Lerwick three days later. On 9 July, she began the journey back to Germany, arriving in Wihelmshaven on the 20th.|$|E
