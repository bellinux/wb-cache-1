50|$|In the {{few days}} {{following}} the Pratt Street Riot, Governor Hicks likely assented to Mayor Brown's decision to dispatch the Maryland militiamen to destroy the railroad bridges over the rivers north of the city, to prevent more troops from passing through Baltimore. This was an act both Hicks and Brown would later deny—though Isaac Ridgeway Trimble, commanding Baltimore militia companies immediately following the Riot—later claimed that Brown <b>authorized</b> <b>destruction</b> of the railroad bridges, which may explain Brown's later arrest and imprisonment by federal authorities. Shortly thereafter, a Maryland militia captain and Baltimore County farmer, John Merryman, was arrested, held at Fort McHenry and later denied a writ of habeas corpus, on grounds that President Lincoln had suspended the writ (but only along rail lines in Maryland). This arrest sparked the case of Ex parte Merryman.|$|E

Montgomerie, {{recalling that}} the Bengal sailors who had {{discovered}} the slab while clearing the jungle could not be persuaded to continue the work, commented: [...] "What a pity it is that those who <b>authorized</b> the <b>destruction</b> of the ancient relic were not prevented by some such wholesome superstition!" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{data for the}} 1890 Census is no longer available. Almost all the population schedules were damaged in {{a fire in the}} basement of the Commerce Building in Washington, D.C. in 1921. Some 25% of the materials were presumed destroyed and another 50% damaged by smoke and water (although the actual damage may have been closer to 15-25%). The damage to the records led to an outcry for a permanent National Archives. In December 1932, following standard Federal record-keeping procedures, the Chief Clerk of the Bureau of the Census sent the Librarian of Congress a list of papers to be destroyed, including the original 1890 census schedules. The Librarian was asked by the Bureau to identify any records which should be retained for historical purposes, but the Librarian did not accept the census records. Congress <b>authorized</b> <b>destruction</b> of that list of records on February 21, 1933, and the surviving original 1890 census records were destroyed by government order by 1934 or 1935. The other censuses for which some information has been lost are the 1800 and 1810 enumerations.|$|E

Moretti then joins the Cabinet in betraying and assassinating Nissen. However, Moretti betrays the conspirators and locks them inside the White House, which he rigs to explode.|$|R
5000|$|The Hicklin test {{is a legal}} {{test for}} {{obscenity}} established by the English case Regina v. Hicklin (1868). At issue was the statutory interpretation of the word [...] "obscene" [...] in the Obscene Publications Act 1857, which <b>authorized</b> the <b>destruction</b> of obscene books. The court held that all material tending [...] "to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences" [...] was obscene, regardless of its artistic or literary merit.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, six {{replacement}} gunboats {{were being}} built for Yangtze duty. The Secretary of the Navy's report for 1927 stated that Villalobos was in bad condition as regarding both hull and machinery {{and had little}} sale value. On 29 December 1927, President Calvin Coolidge <b>authorized</b> the <b>destruction</b> of Villalobos by gunfire; and the gunboat was placed out of commission on 29 May 1928. Struck from the Navy list on 4 October, the venerable gunboat was towed to sea and sunk in experimental destroyer gunnery exercises off the China coast on 9 October 1928.|$|R
50|$|The {{developers}} did {{not have}} the funds to do such an extensive project, and in a controversial decision the NCC chose not to look for a new partner and in September 1991 <b>authorized</b> the <b>destruction</b> of the building. This was the first designated heritage building destroyed in the city since the heritage guidelines were introduced in 1982. It was a hugely controversial decision in Ottawa, that drew much criticism of the NCC both for the years of neglect that let the building decline and for the final decision to demolish it. It was demolished piecemeal circa October 1991-March 1992.|$|R
5000|$|Copyright in a design, whether {{registered}} under § 102(a)(5) or § 102(a)(8), generally {{gives an}} architect the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, display, and prepare a work {{based upon the}} design. [...] This protection, unless the work is a work-made-for-hire, lasts {{for the life of}} the author plus 70 years. [...] However, several limitations on those rights apply depending upon which section the work is registered under. The most significant limitation to registering a design as a [...] "pictorial, graphic, or sculptural" [...] work under § 102(a)(5) is that the copyright owner cannot prevent the construction of a building based upon the registered design. [...] In contrast, while construction of a building can be prevented under § 102(a)(8), two other important limitations apply when registering a design as an [...] "architectural work". First, when a building is ordinarily visible from a public place, its protection as an [...] "architectural work" [...] does not include the right to prevent the making, distributing, or public display of pictures, photographs, or other pictorial representations of the work. [...] Thus, the architect will not be able to prevent people from taking photographs or otherwise producing pictorial representations of the building. Second, owners of a copyrighted building may both make or authorize the making of alterations to the building and destroy or <b>authorize</b> <b>destruction</b> of the building. [...] Thus, the architect will not have the right to prevent the owner of a house that he or she designed from altering or destroying the building. This exception also allows owners of partially complete buildings to complete the building using construction plans created by the architect.|$|R

But is it not most evident that the general exhortations to be met with in the Homilies of the Church of England, and such like declarations in the statutes of the kingdom, are meant only as rules for the civil obedience of the subject to the legal administration of the supreme power in ordinary cases? And it is equally absurd to construe any words in a positive law to <b>authorize</b> the <b>destruction</b> of the whole, as to expect that King, Lords, and Commons should, in express terms of law, declare such an ultimate resort as the right of resistance, {{at a time when}} the case supposes that the force of all law is ceased."[18] ...|$|R
500|$|If a {{building}} or structure in a security area is left unoccupied {{due to an}} order relating to the security area, and the officer {{in charge of the}} police division in which the building or structure is situated takes the view that it may be used by [...] "any person or persons who intend, or are about, to act or have recently acted in a manner prejudicial to public security or by any other person who is likely to harbour any such persons", and it is not practical to prevent such use, the officer can <b>authorize</b> the <b>destruction</b> of the building or structure. Compensation is payable for such destruction to a person if he or she can demonstrate to the Minister that the building or structure was constructed with the consent of the person lawfully entitled to the land on which it stood, and it was not liable to be forfeited. Even if the building or structure was subject to forfeiture, the Minister can still pay compensation to the owner or occupier if the latter person can prove that it was used by persons acting in a manner prejudicial to public security or for harbouring such persons without his or her knowledge or consent, and that he or she exercised due diligence to ensure that the building would not be used in this manner.|$|R

5000|$|Thomas Holliday Hicks, 1798-1865, Initially a Democrat, later a Whig, Hicks {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} and wily elected officials in Maryland history concluding his elective career with the post of governor of the state as a member of the American Nativist Part or “No Nothing” Party. Prior to his election as governor in 1857 as a “Know Nothing” Hicks had been elected in 1827 as the Sheriff for Dorchester County, then 3 times to single year terms in the Maryland House of Delegates (1829, 1830. and 1836) as well as to the November 1836 special session (one of 2 special sessions that year). In 1837 he was the last person elected by the state legislature to the powerful Governor’s Council prior to that body’s abolition. In 1838 he was appointed (as a Whig) to be the Chief Registrar of Register of Wills of Dorchester County and served until 1857. As Governor of Maryland (1858-1862) he was instrumental in the presidential election of 1856 in carrying Maryland as the only state to cast its electoral votes for Millard Fillmore, the nominee of the Native American Party. Hicks was also crucial in the efforts maintaining Maryland within the Union. Though an opponent of foreign immigration and a supporter of slavery, he was a more ardent supporter of the Union. Playing both sides for time he <b>authorized</b> the <b>destruction</b> of bridges across the Susquehanna River to delay pro Union Federal Volunteers from coming into Maryland while simultaneously sanctioning the arrest of southern sympathizers immediately preceding his snap call of the Maryland general assembly into special session to consider secession. The session was convened in the somewhat removed town of Frederick City, which delayed secessionist supporters not already arrested from attending. As noted above, his efforts to avoid conflict between Federal Volunteer Troops of the 16th Massachusetts ultimately resulted in the Federal occupation of Baltimore City, thus inadvertently guaranteeing Union control of the city (then 4th largest in the nation) and secured enough time for the same delayed troops through a circuitous routing, to reach and seize the nation's westernmost Atlantic coastal port city and its critical rail hubs. This prevented the Confederates from effectively isolating the Federal capital by surrounding it and perhaps handing them an early victory. Appointed by his successor governor, he became an U.S. Senator in 1862 until his death in February 1865.|$|R
