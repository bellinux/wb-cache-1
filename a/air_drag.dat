25|$|The force {{accelerating}} a pinewood derby car is gravity; {{the opposing}} forces are friction and <b>air</b> <b>drag.</b> Therefore, car modifications {{are aimed at}} maximizing the potential energy in the car design and minimizing the <b>air</b> <b>drag</b> and the friction that occurs when the wheel spins on the axle, contacts the axle head or car body, or contacts the track guide rail. Friction due to <b>air</b> <b>drag</b> is a minor, although not insignificant, factor. The wheel tread can be sanded or turned on a lathe and the inner surface of the hub can be tapered to minimize the contact area between the hub and body. Polishing the wheel, especially the inner hub, with a plastic polish can also reduce friction. Often one front wheel is raised slightly {{so that it does}} not contact the track and add to the rolling resistance. Axles are filed or turned on a lathe to remove the burr and crimp marks and polished smooth. More extensive modifications involve tapering the axle head and cutting a notch to minimize the wheel-to-axle contact area. Packs can establish additional rules for what, if any, modifications are allowed. In some areas, no changes can be made to the axles or wheels.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of individual polystyrene ellipsoids of different aspect ratios trapped at the air-water interface. Using particle tracking and in situ vertical scanning interferometry techniques {{we are able to}} measure translational drags and the protrusion in air of the ellipsoids. We report that translational drags on the ellipsoid are unexpectedly enhanced: despite the fact that a noticeable part of the ellipsoid is in <b>air,</b> <b>drags</b> are found larger than the bulk one in water...|$|R
50|$|This {{ammunition}} often {{features a}} boat-tail (narrowing {{at the base}} end), because it provides better ballistic performance due to the reduced <b>air</b> resistance (<b>drag).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{two main}} {{aerodynamic}} forces acting on any aircraft are lift supporting {{it in the}} <b>air</b> and <b>drag</b> opposing its motion. Control surfaces or other techniques may {{also be used to}} affect these forces directly, without inducing any rotation.|$|R
25|$|Some systems (notably the Swissmetro system) {{propose the}} use of vactrains—maglev train {{technology}} used in evacuated (airless) tubes, which removes <b>air</b> <b>drag.</b> This {{has the potential to}} increase speed and efficiency greatly, as most of the energy for conventional maglev trains is lost to aerodynamic drag.|$|E
25|$|The {{required}} delta-v {{can also}} be calculated for a particular manoeuvre; for example the delta-v to launch {{from the surface of}} the Earth to Low earth orbit is about 9.7km/s, which leaves the vehicle with a sideways speed of about 7.8km/s at an altitude of around 200km. In this manoeuvre about 1.9km/s is lost in <b>air</b> <b>drag,</b> gravity drag and gaining altitude.|$|E
25|$|The simple gravity {{pendulum}} is {{an idealized}} mathematical {{model of a}} pendulum. This is a weight (or bob) {{on the end of}} a massless cord suspended from a , without friction. When given an initial push, it will swing back and forth at a constant amplitude. Real pendulums are subject to friction and <b>air</b> <b>drag,</b> so the amplitude of their swings declines.|$|E
5000|$|When the aerodynamists {{were doing}} their tests, Breer {{suggested}} they test the {{models in the}} opposite direction. They were astonished {{to find that the}} <b>air</b> resistance <b>drag</b> was 30% less this way. Breer looking out a window then made the remark ...|$|R
50|$|The Sea Raiders, a band {{of foreign}} agents, led by Carl Tonjes and Elliott Carlton, blow up a {{freighter}} on which Billy Adams and Toby Nelson are stowaways, seeking to avoid Brack Warren, a harbor patrol officer assigned to guard {{a new type of}} torpedo boat built by Billy's brother, Tom Adams. Intended targets or not, getting blown up does not set well with Billy and Toby and, together with their gang coupled with the members of the Little Tough Guys, they find the Sea Raiders' island hideout, investigate the seacoast underground arsenal of these saboteurs, get blasted from the <b>air,</b> <b>dragged</b> to their doom, become victims of the storm, entombed in a tunnel and even periled by a panther before they don the uniforms of some captured Sea Raiders and board a yacht that serves as headquarters for the Raiders.|$|R
50|$|The Shramjeevi Express was {{travelling}} from New Delhi to Patna {{at a time}} of {{high tension}} between Muslim and Hindu groups in the area who have a history of mutual violence and antagonism. The train derailed suddenly after hitting a broken rail, throwing the carriages in the <b>air</b> and <b>dragging</b> thirteen of them off the rails, some into each other.|$|R
25|$|The fastest {{enterprise}} HDDs spin at 10,000 or 15,000rpm, and {{can achieve}} sequential media transfer speeds above 1.6Gbit/s and a sustained transfer rate up to 1Gbit/s. Drives running at 10,000 or 15,000rpm use smaller platters to mitigate increased power requirements (as {{they have less}} <b>air</b> <b>drag)</b> and therefore generally have lower capacity than the highest capacity desktop drives. Enterprise HDDs are commonly connected through Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) or Fibre Channel (FC). Some support multiple ports, {{so they can be}} connected to a redundant host bus adapter.|$|E
25|$|Efficiency: For maglev systems the {{lift-to-drag}} ratio can exceed that of aircraft (for example Inductrack can approach 200:1 at high speed, {{far higher than}} any aircraft). This can make maglev more efficient per kilometer. However, at high cruising speeds, aerodynamic drag is much larger than lift-induced drag. Jets take advantage of low air density at high altitudes to significantly reduce <b>air</b> <b>drag.</b> Hence despite their {{lift-to-drag ratio}} disadvantage, they can travel more efficiently at high speeds than maglev trains that operate at sea level.|$|E
25|$|The {{flag was}} {{fastened}} to a Г-shaped rod (see Lunar Flag Assembly) {{so that it}} did not hang down. The flag only seemed to flutter when the astronauts were moving it into position. Without <b>air</b> <b>drag,</b> these movements caused the free corner of the flag to swing like a pendulum for some time. The flag was rippled because it had been folded during storage – the ripples could be mistaken for movement in a still photo. Videos show that when the astronauts let go of the flagpole it vibrates briefly but then remains still.|$|E

Molloy was supported in an open letter, drafted by Zinnia Jones and signed by Sarah Brown, Fallon Fox, Christina Kahrl, and over 350 other transgender people, against what they perceived as personal attacks by Addams and James.|$|R
50|$|A pylon {{serves to}} connect the frame of an {{aircraft}} to an item or object that is being carried; hence, it is an adaptor. The use of a pylon is necessary to clear the carriage item of control surfaces as well as prevent undesired disturbance {{of the flow of}} air toward the wing. Pylons are usually designed to be aerodynamic to reduce <b>air</b> resistance (<b>drag).</b> There are many different forms, sizes and designs of pylons distinctly termed accordingly like a wedge adaptor or stub wing pylon.|$|R

Meanwhile, the Pakistani authorities try to stall for time. When a younger terrorist assaults the passengers and molests the attendants, the terrorist leader chastises him; humiliated, the younger terrorist storms into the cockpit and shoots Ali, screaming wild threats over the radio. While negotiations with the Pakistani <b>air</b> controllers <b>drag</b> on, the negotiators slowly lose control of the situation, with the hijackers becoming more agitated by the minute.|$|R

2500|$|Consider {{the case}} of a vehicle that starts at rest and coasts down a {{mountain}} road, the work-energy principle helps compute the minimum distance that the vehicle travels to reach a velocity V, of say 60mph (88 fps). [...] Rolling resistance and <b>air</b> <b>drag</b> will slow the vehicle down so the actual distance will be greater than if these forces are neglected.|$|E

2500|$|The SP1900 trains {{feature a}} {{completely}} difference appearance {{from the older}} Metro-Cammell EMU on the East Rail Line. Most notably, the [...] "head" [...] car, D car, presents a slight bullet train-shaped head for better acceleration against <b>air</b> <b>drag</b> at high speeds. Its exterior livery is almost identical to the older trains following refurbishment, with five sliding doors {{on each side of}} the standard compartment and two {{on each side of the}} first class compartment, of which one is normally unused.|$|E
50|$|A {{familiar}} {{example of}} a trajectory is {{the path of a}} projectile, such as a thrown ball or rock. In a significantly simplified model, the object moves only under the influence of a uniform gravitational force field. This can be a good approximation for a rock that is thrown for short distances, for example at the surface of the moon. In this simple approximation, the trajectory takes the shape of a parabola. Generally when determining trajectories, {{it may be necessary to}} account for nonuniform gravitational forces and <b>air</b> resistance (<b>drag</b> and aerodynamics). This is the focus of the discipline of ballistics.|$|R

500|$|In {{considering}} {{the physics of}} the celestial spheres, scholars followed two different views about the material composition of the celestial spheres. [...] For Plato, the celestial regions were made [...] "mostly out of fire" [...] on account of fire's mobility. [...] Later Platonists, such as Plotinus, maintained that although fire moves naturally upward {{in a straight line}} toward its natural place at the periphery of the universe, when it arrived there, it would either rest or move naturally in a circle. This account was compatible with Aristotle's meteorology of a fiery region in the upper <b>air,</b> <b>dragged</b> along underneath the circular motion of the lunar sphere. For Aristotle, however, the spheres themselves were made entirely of a special fifth element, Aether (Αἰθήρ), the bright, untainted upper atmosphere in which the gods dwell, as distinct from the dense lower atmosphere, Aer (Ἀήρ). While the four terrestrial elements (earth, water, air and fire) gave rise to the generation and corruption of natural substances by their mutual transformations, aether was unchanging, moving always with a uniform circular motion that was uniquely suited to the celestial spheres, which were eternal. [...] Earth and water had a natural heaviness (gravitas), which they expressed by moving downward {{toward the center of the}} universe. Fire and air had a natural lightness (levitas), such that they moved upward, away from the center. Aether, being neither heavy nor light, moved naturally around the center.|$|R
2500|$|A human {{traveling}} {{on a bicycle}} at low to medium speeds of around [...] uses only the power required to walk. <b>Air</b> <b>drag,</b> which {{is proportional to the}} square of speed, requires dramatically higher power outputs as speeds increase. If the rider is sitting upright, the rider's body creates about 75% of the total drag of the bicycle/rider combination. Drag can be reduced by seating the rider in a more aerodynamically streamlined position. Drag can also be reduced by covering the bicycle with an aerodynamic fairing. The fastest recorded unpaced speed on a flat surface is ...|$|E
2500|$|Initially the Boeing Model 69, it was {{inspired}} by the results of tests on the FB-6, which was powered by a Pratt & Whitney R-1340B Wasp radial engine. Boeing set out to use this engine in a fighter designed specifically for carrier operations, using the same welded-tubing fuselage and wooden-frame wings as for the Model 15, and adding a large spinner to reduce <b>air</b> <b>drag</b> around the engine (this was dropped in production). Armament was either two [...] machine guns, or one [...]30in and one the lower wing had attachments for up to four [...] bombs, plus a fifth could be hung from the fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|Repsold-Bessel pendulum: It was {{time-consuming}} and error-prone to repeatedly swing the Kater's pendulum {{and adjust the}} weights until the periods were equal. [...] Friedrich Bessel showed in 1835 that this was unnecessary. [...] As long as the periods were close together, the gravity could be calculated from the two periods {{and the center of}} gravity of the pendulum. [...] So the reversible pendulum didn't need to be adjustable, it could just be a bar with two pivots. Bessel also showed that if the pendulum was made symmetrical in form about its center, but was weighted internally at one end, the errors due to <b>air</b> <b>drag</b> would cancel out. Further, another error due to the finite diameter of the knife edges could be made to cancel out if they were interchanged between measurements. Bessel didn't construct such a pendulum, but in 1864 Adolf Repsold, under contract by the Swiss Geodetic Commission made a pendulum along these lines. [...] The Repsold pendulum was about 56cm long and had a period of about [...] second. It was used extensively by European geodetic agencies, and with the Kater pendulum in the Survey of India. Similar pendulums of this type were designed by Charles Pierce and C. Defforges.|$|E
5000|$|The Ritwicks {{were asked}} to intensify their {{chanting}} and fire offerings to draw Takshaka to the fire. The Ritwicks told Janamajeya that Takshaka was given shelter by Indra and hence were unable to draw him to the fire. This was also confirmed by Astika. Janamejaya ordered that Indra be dragged into the fire along with Takshaka. And the Hotris (priests) intensified their hymnal chantings and libations (fire offerings). Indra was dragged toward the fire and Takshaka was hiding in Indra's upper garment. As soon as Indra saw the fire sacrifice he got scared and fled from the scene leaving Takshaka in mid <b>air</b> getting <b>dragged</b> towards the fire.|$|R
