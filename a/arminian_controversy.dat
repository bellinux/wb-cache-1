25|$|Since the <b>Arminian</b> <b>controversy,</b> the Reformed tradition—as {{a branch}} of Protestantism {{distinguished}} from Lutheranism—divided into two separate groups, Arminians and Calvinists. However, it is now rare to call Arminians {{a part of the}} Reformed tradition, as many see these two schools of thought as opposed, making the terms Calvinist and Reformed synonymous. While the Reformed theological tradition addresses all of the traditional topics of Christian theology, the word Calvinism is sometimes used to refer to particular Calvinist views on soteriology and predestination, which are summarized in part by the Five Points of Calvinism. Some have also argued that Calvinism as a whole stresses the sovereignty or rule of God in all things including salvation.|$|E
6000|$|But Milton {{drew the}} line of liberty at what he calls 'neighbouring differences, or rather indifferences.' The <b>Arminian</b> <b>controversy</b> had {{loosened}} the bonds with which the newly liberated churches of the Reformation, had made haste to bind themselves again, and weakened that authority of confessions, which had replaced the older but not more intolerant authority of the universal church. Other controversies which raged {{during the first half}} of the seventeenth century,--those between catholics and protestants, between prelatists and presbyterians, between socinians and trinitarians, between latitudinarians, puritans, and sacramentalists,--all tended to weaken theological exclusiveness. This slackening, however, was no more than partial. Roger Williams, indeed, the Welsh founder of Rhode Island, preached, as early as 1631, the principles of an unlimited toleration, extending to catholics, Jews, and even infidels. Milton stopped a long way short of this. He did not mean 'tolerated popery and open superstition, which, as it extirpates all religious and civil supremacies, so itself should be extirpate, provided first that all charitable and compassionate means be used to win and regain the weak and the misled: that also which is impious or evil absolutely either against faith or manners no law can possibly permit that intends not to unlaw itself.' ...|$|E
50|$|In 1759 Edwards {{published}} The Doctrine of Irresistible Grace {{proved to}} have no foundation in the Writings of the N. T., a book of some importance in the Calvinist and <b>Arminian</b> <b>controversy,</b> and in 1762 Prolegomena in Libros Veteris Testamenti Poeticos, to which he added an attack upon Robert Lowth's Metricæ Harianæ brevis Confutatio, {{which led to a}} controversy of some length.|$|E
5000|$|The {{practice}} {{originated in}} 1619 when, after the Synod of Dort forced the States of Holland to dismiss clerics for encouraging refuge to individuals being persecuted for religious beliefs, three brothers of Warmond {{by the name}} of van der Kodde (or Codde)—Gijsbert, Jan Jacobsz, and Adriaen—decided to hold religious services of their own. [...] The sect began as a refuge from the perceived bitterness of the Calvinist and <b>Arminian</b> <b>controversies</b> of the day. Their name is derived from the custom which they had of calling their communities [...] "Colleges", which they were followed by Spener and the Pietists of Germany.|$|R
50|$|In {{a sermon}} Columba Noæ of February 1624 (1623 Old Style) to Convocation, {{he gave a}} list or {{personal}} panorama of leading theologians of the Church of England. In the same year he also refused the see of Gloucester: at the time English delegates to Dort were receiving preferment, since King James approved of the outcome. Hall was then involved as a mediator, taking {{an active part in}} the <b>Arminian</b> and Calvinist <b>controversy</b> in the English church, and trying to get other clergy to accept Dort. In 1627, he became Bishop of Exeter.|$|R
50|$|During {{his time}} at the university, Robinson was an active {{participant}} in the <b>Arminian</b> <b>controversy,</b> siding with the Calvinists. The Arminians believed in free will, rejected predestination, and advocated the possibility of salvation for all. Calvinists, on the other hand, which was the basis of the state's Dutch Reformed Church, maintained that God is sovereign in the areas of redemption and regeneration. They believed that God saves whom he will, when he will, and how he will.|$|E
50|$|The Belgic Confession {{became the}} basis of a counter to the <b>Arminian</b> <b>controversy</b> that arose in the {{following}} century and was opposed by Arminius himself. The text was revised again at the Synod of Dort in 1618-19, was included in the Canons of Dort (1618-19), and adopted as one of the doctrinal standards to which all office-bearers and members of the Reformed churches were required to subscribe. This revision was drafted in the French language (1618-19).|$|E
50|$|Slade {{threw himself}} into the <b>Arminian</b> <b>controversy.</b> He corresponded with the Contra-Remonstrant leader Sibrand Lubbertus at Franeker University from 1611 to 20 August 1620. When in 1611 Conrad Vorstius was {{appointed}} successor to Jacobus Arminius as theological professor at the University of Leiden, Slade wrote an attack on him, Cum Conrado Vorstio (1612), the second volume being published by his associate Jodocus Hondius the Younger. Vorstius was compelled by the States of Holland, at James I's instigation, to quit Leiden in 1612.|$|E
5000|$|These canons are in {{actuality}} a judicial {{decision on the}} doctrinal points in dispute from the <b>Arminian</b> <b>controversy</b> of that day. Following the death of Arminius (1560-1609), his followers set forth a Remonstrance (published in 1610) in five articles formulating their points of departure from the stricter Calvinism of the Belgic Confession. The Canons are {{the judgment of the}} Synod against this Remonstrance. [...] Regardless, Arminian theology later received official acceptance by the State and has since continued in various forms within Protestantism, especially within the Methodist churches.|$|E
50|$|Episcopius {{retired to}} Antwerp and {{ultimately}} to France, where he lived partly at Paris, partly at Rouen. He devoted {{most of his time}} to writings in support of the Arminian cause; but the attempt of Luke Wadding to convert him to Catholicism involved him also in a controversy. After the death (1625) of Maurice, prince of Orange, the violence of the <b>Arminian</b> <b>controversy</b> began to abate, and Episcopius was permitted in 1626 to return to his own country. He was appointed preacher at the Remonstrant church in Rotterdam and afterwards rector of the Remonstrant college in Amsterdam, where he died.|$|E
50|$|In 1614 Slade was {{involved}} in further controversy with Rem Bisschop, another Remonstrant, {{at the house of}} his relation by marriage Plancius. When the debate became important to diplomacy, Slade passed intelligence to Sir Dudley Carleton, who was English ambassador at The Hague from 1616. Slade sent to Carleton a work on the <b>Arminian</b> <b>controversy</b> early in 1618. He went to Francis Johnson's funeral, and reported to Carleton on Johnson's final views on Arminianism, as presented in his book The Christian Plea. The older interpretations, by Edward Arber and Henry Morton Dexter, of Slade's testimony about Johnson have been contested.|$|E
50|$|Cotton {{had long}} denounced Arminianism in his sermons. Hutchinson {{took up the}} anti-Arminian cause in strong language, propounding an extreme form of double predestination (a view popularized among English Puritans by William Perkins), which held that God chose those who would go to heaven (the elect) and those who would go to hell (the reprobate), and that His {{decision}} inevitably and infallibly came to pass. Applying this framework to the <b>Arminian</b> <b>controversy,</b> Hutchinson argued that people were either under a covenant of works (they were relying on good works for their salvation, and therefore were really damned) or else a covenant of grace (in which case they were dependent only on God's grace, and were therefore really saved).|$|E

50|$|The early 17th-century <b>Arminian</b> <b>controversy,</b> {{in which}} a group known as the Remonstrants argued that predestination to {{salvation}} is based on God foreseeing a person's faith, brought about the Synod of Dort, which defined the Reformed doctrine on this matter in greater detail. The 1594 treatise by Huguenot theologian Franciscus Junius On True Theology was the first Protestant work to distinguish archetypal theology (God's knowledge of himself) and ectypal theology (our knowledge of God based on his condescending revelation to us). This distinction, which {{has its roots in}} the medieval Scotist distinction between theology in itself (theologia in se) and our theology (theologia nostra), limits the degree to which God can be known by sinful man and became very important in later Reformed and Lutheran theology.|$|E
