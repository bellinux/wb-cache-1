In recent years, it has seen wide spread application in many fields such as mechanical [J Quality Technol 24 (1992) 22], chemical [Quality Engng 9 (1997) 391] and civil [Quality Engng 9 (1997) 441] engineering. As an additional application, this paper investigates the use of robust design techniques during early design process, in order to predict, analyse and improve quality and reliability of spindle motors found within hard disks.

40|$|Environmental {{monitoring}} {{has grown}} substantially {{in recent years}} in response to increasing concerns over the contamination of natural, industrial, and urban areas with potentially harmful chemical agents. Traditional monitoring of water contamination is based upon manual in-situ ‘grab’ sampling followed by laboratory testing. Advantages of this strategy include high precision and accuracy of the measurements, however because of the expense involved in maintaining these facilities there are inherent restrictions in terms of spatial and temporal sampling. In contrast, in-situ measurements generated with portable instruments present a much more scalable model, enabling denser monitoring. The challenge is to develop inexpensive and reliable devices that can be used in-situ, with the capability to make the resulting data available remotely via web-databases, so that water quality can be monitored independently of location. Miniaturisation of analytical devices through the advent of microfluidics has brought wide opportunities for water analysis applications. The vision is to miniaturise processes typically performed in a central clinical lab into small, simple to use devices – so called lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems. Microfludic systems are especially promising for point-of-care applications due to the low cost, low reagent consumption and portability, and the focus of this thesis is to provide novel microfluidic platforms towards an integrated system for water quality analysis. A main outcome of my work was the development and validation of innovative integrated systems that were designed and developed for quantitative analysis of turbidity and qualitative analysis of pH and nitrites in water samples. The microfluidic manifolds were designed and fabricated using rapid prototyping techniques such as soft lithography and CO 2 laser cutting. For fluid propulsion, various methods were employed: back pressure, capillary forces (typical microfluidic manifolds) and centrifugal force (centrifugal discs). In the latter, fluid propulsion was performed by the forces induced due to the rotation of the disc, thus eliminating the need for external pumps since only <b>a</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>motor</b> is necessary to rotate the disc. Centrifugal discs systems are especially promising for point-of-care applications, and as a final output the fully integrated portable wireless system for in-situ colorimetric analysis was demonstrated. In all systems a low cost but highly sensitive paired emitter- detector diode (PEDD) method was employed to perform colorimetric measurements. Moreover, due to the wireless communication, acquisition parameters were controlled remotely and the results were downloaded from distant locations and displayed in real time. The autonomous capabilities of the system, combined with the portability and wireless communication, provide the basis for a flexible new approach for on-site water monitoring. In addition, their small size and low weight offered the advantage of portability. The suitability of the low-power analysers for the precise and continuous measurement of samples was established, since the analysers exhibited low limits of detection. Freshwater samples were analysed and the results were compared to those generated with a conventional bench-top instruments showing good agreement. Additionally, stimuli-responsive materials based on N- isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) phosphonium ionogels were characterised and incorporated within microfluidic platforms as sensors and actuators. The phase change NIPAAm ionogel functionalised with spirobenzopyran chromophores was characterised and applied for fluid control within microfluidic manifold. Microvalve actuation was performed by the localised white light irradiation, thus allowing for non-contact manipulation of the liquids inside of the microchannels.

Taxol interferes with microtubule dynamics, though the sister kinetochores are closer together and remain bound to microtubules.

40|$|AbstractA milling {{operation}} is inherently an intermittent material removal process where cutter engagement and disengagement is repeated {{until the end}} of the material removal process. During the process, the cutter receives multiple impacts and mechanical and thermal vibrations which eventually damage the cutting edge. The optimum rigidity and damping of the <b>spindle</b> <b>motor</b> for the least tool damage highly depends on the cutter and workpiece material properties and the cutting application. This paper introduces the concept of flexible rotational rigidity control using a high performance Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) which is used as <b>a</b> direct <b>spindle</b> drive.

50|$|Rotational latency (sometimes called {{rotational}} delay or just latency) is the delay {{waiting for the}} rotation of the disk to bring the required disk sector under the read-write head. It depends on the rotational speed of <b>a</b> disk (or <b>spindle</b> <b>motor),</b> measured in revolutions per minute (RPM). For most magnetic media-based drives, the average rotational latency is typically based on the empirical relation that the average latency in milliseconds for such a drive is one-half the rotational period. Maximum rotational latency is {{the time it takes to}} do a full rotation excluding any spin-up time (as the relevant part of the disk may have just passed the head when the request arrived). Therefore, the rotational latency and resulting access time can be improved (decreased) by increasing the rotational speed of the disks. This also has the benefit of improving (increasing) the throughput (discussed later in this article).|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} effects of shock and the disk surface pattern on the head disk interface (HDI) response in hard disk drives (HDDs). A new local adaptive mesh method is proposed at the end to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm to simulate the sliders' steady flying attitudes. Over the past decades, {{there has been an}} increase in the demand of HDDs used in portable devices. In such applications, the work performance of a HDD mainly depends on its ability to withstand external disturbances. Studies of the HDD's responses and failures during external shocks can be very beneficial for improving the HDD's design. A multi-body operational shock (op-shock) model is developed for this purpose in this thesis. The Guyan reduction method is used to model all the components considered in the op-shock model (a disk, <b>a</b> <b>spindle</b> <b>motor,</b> a base plate, a pivot and a head actuator assembly (HAA)). A fluid dynamic bearing (FDB), between the rotating and stationary units in the spindle motor, is simplified as a spring-dashpot system to save computation efforts. The same simplification is applied to a ball bearing (BB) system between the rotating and stationary units in the actuator pivot. Then the reduced models for all the components are assembled to obtain a complete multi-body op-shock model. Four models which include different components are introduced in this thesis to investigate various components' effects on the HDD's operating performance. The HDDs' failure mechanisms are also studied. It is found that different components influence the HDI responses in different ways. The ramp load/unload (LUL) technology has been proved to be a better alternative to the contact start-stop (CSS) approach due to the advantages of increasing areal density and greater durability. However, the application of the LUL ramps in the HDDs increases the possibility of collisions between the disk and the ramps since the ramps sit closely to the disk's outer radius. Therefore, it is important to study the ramp effects on the HDD's response during a shock. A reduced model of a deformable ramp is developed and implemented to the multi-body op-shock model. Numerical analyses using three ramp models (no-ramp model, rigid ramp model and deformable ramp model) are carried out to study the HDD's failure dependence on different ramp models. Bit patterned media (BPM) recording is one of the promising techniques for future disk drives in order to increase the areal density above 4 Tbit/in 2. In patterned media, an individual recorded bit is stored in a distinct magnetic island. Thus, the BPM can change the topography of the disk surface and has an effect on the flying characteristics of the air bearing sliders. Proper designs of sliders and disks in the HDDs are required in order to achieve a stable work performance. So a simulator to model a slider's flying condition over a BPM disk is particularly important. Three methods (the averaging method, the Homogenization method and the Taylor expansion Homogenization methods) are implemented to simulate a slider's flying attitude, and finally an economical accurate method is chosen (the Taylor expansion Homogenization method) to investigate the slider's dynamics on partially planarized patterned media. In modern HDDs, the requirement of small and steady head disk spacing leads to more complicated air bearing surface designs. Thus it is challenging for an air bearing simulator to accurately capture the pressure under a slider's surface. A new local adaptive grid-generating algorithm is developed and is used to simulate the sliders' steady flying attitude. Local finer meshes (mesh's dimension decreases to half) are created on the nodes of the current grids, which have pressure gradients or geometry gradients larger than a pre-defined tolerance. Two sliders are used to demonstrate the applicability of this method. It is found that this new local adaptive grid-generating method improves the stability and efficiency of the simulation scheme...|$|E

Due to the absence of flow during the capturing process, i. e. particle sedimentation is driven by the artificial gravity field on the centrifugal platform, the capture efficiency of this approach is close to 100 % which is notably higher than values reported for typical pressure driven systems. After capturing the particles, the surrounding medium can easily be exchanged to expose them to various conditions such as staining solutions or washing buffers, and thus perform assays on the captured particles. By scale matching the size of the capturing elements {{to the size of the}} particles, sharply peaked single occupancy can be achieved. Since all particles are arrayed in the same focal plane in spatially well defined locations, operations such as counting or fluorescent detection can be performed easily. The application of this platform to perform multiplexed bead-based immunoassays as well as the discrimination of various cell types based on intra cellular and membrane based markers using fluorescently tagged antibodies is demonstrated. Additionally, methods to manipulate captured particles either in batch mode or on an individual particle level have been developed and characterized. Batch release of captured particles is performed by a novel magnetic actuator which is solely controlled by the rotation frequency of the disc. Furthermore, the application of this actuator to rapidly mix liquids is shown. Manipulation of individual particles is performed using an optical tweezers setup which has been developed as part of this work.

5000|$|A typical CD-ROM drive {{operates}} in CLV mode, {{in contrast to}} a floppy or hard disk drive, or gramophone, which {{operates in}} CAV mode. In CAV mode, the <b>spindle</b> <b>motor</b> turns at <b>a</b> constant speed, which makes the medium pass by the read/write head faster when the head is positioned at the outside of the disk. In contrast, in CLV mode, the <b>spindle</b> <b>motor</b> speed varies so that the medium passes by the head at the same speed regardless of where on the disk the head is positioned.|$|R

25|$|Maxtor's product {{architecture}} used eight disks; 15 surfaces recorded {{data and}} the final surface was where the servo track information was located. The company developed its own <b>spindle</b> <b>motor,</b> which was fitted within the casting containing the disks. This was a major departure as the <b>spindle</b> <b>motor</b> was usually mounted external to the disks. The first product was designed to provide 190MB of storage, but delays in getting magnetic heads to the Maxtor design resulted in the company taking what was available, and the first drive—the XT-1140—was shipped with a capacity of only 140MB. The company received an additional round of financing of approximately $37 million in 1984 before going public in 1985, with Goldman Sachs as the prime underwriter.|$|R
