At the time, it is clear that she considered me a dilatory intermediary. I had not realized how extreme was her need.

40|$|AbstractThis is a {{longitudinal}} in‐depth case study that was conducted within a Portuguese public sector organization, the National Postal Service of Portugal, where two management accounting innovations were implemented. The aim {{of one of}} the innovations – Income Statements – was to account for the financial results for the different areas within the organization, which could filter down to its basic elements. The aim of the other – Key Performance Indicators – was to provide indicators to monitor business performance. These innovations were not used in practice as planned, which <b>afforded</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to explain the existing gap between their rules and routines. To do this, I based this study on the old institutional economics (OIE) inspired management accounting change literature. Following a strategy of collating together issues from more than one theory, this study contributes to the OIE inspired management accounting change literature by providing evidence that trust and power issues should be analyzed simultaneously and not separately, in order to extend our understanding of how management accounting innovations are (or are not) used in practice, and it also provides evidence that external and internal pressures or the lack of them should be considered through time and not only in explaining the initial stage(s) of the management accounting change processes. The study also provides practical insights for those who intend to carry out changes in management accounting practices in an organizational setting...|$|E
40|$|This summer I {{have worked}} on a vital {{research}} project {{that is important to}} overall public health. This project has also <b>afforded</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to develop a lesson plan around this research to be used in an elementary classroom setting. The first part of this research experience has centered around studying how the general public learns best through classroom activities and exhibits. I have expanded my understanding of how people learn by reading several books, articles, and shadowing teachers educators here at NCAR. This preliminary research was important so that I can communicate effectively with 4 th grade students. The second part of this research has focused on learning about the vector mosquito Aedes Aegypti and vector borne diseases like zika, yellow fever, and dengue through fieldwork. In addition, to the vector mosquito, this project also looked at the environments that it can survive in as well as the habitats that it chooses to live in. People should care for their health through prevention by learning about what contributes to such vectors and vector borne diseases. It is important that the public including children learn about the dangers of vector borne diseases to the public. After conducting fieldwork this project has now focused on strengthening my writing and speaking skills to be better prepared to inform the public with a focus on 4 th grade learners. This research complied from fieldwork and in the classroom inspired the creation of a short book and activity about the vector mosquito Aedes Aegypti. In the end, I have been able to translate my research and fieldwork into the classroom where numerous people/students can learn about the vector and vector borne diseases...|$|E
40|$|The monoprint Fall, {{created in}} the artist-in-residence studio at Dartmouth College, Hanover, New England, {{represents}} a transient yet vivid memory of the season spent walking and re-walking a trail I took to the studio on a daily basis. The work arose spontaneously from a direct and instinctive wish to replicate the ghost imprints left on the trail by the wet and dry weather of that autumn. It also represented a sensationally hopeful political transition of {{what seemed to be}} the growth of hope within US thinking at the time. The autumn of 2008 was momentous, full of changing colour in foliage and skyscape. Fall was made during the quiet nights spent in the studio on my own, listening to my own silence and rhythm and at times interrupted by listening to music. This one-off mural work was made as part of various experimental works in print created during the residency. The work, painted over after my residency, now only exists in photographs. This print collage <b>afforded</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to continue the exploration of movement and the body on a monumental scale, activating a range of references to different cultural frameworks. It extended my attempt throughout my work to create dynamic and intricate relationships in material structures: in this case between the leaf elements and the whole through accumulation, layering, spacing and contrasts of colour and shade – creating the illusion of body volume in two dimensions. The mural significantly expanded my engagement with line and brush drawings on scrolls, by relating physically and emotionally to the site-specificity and my experience of the place during the autumn residency...|$|E

40|$|What is Church {{archaeology}} today, {{and what}} would we {{like it to be}} tomorrow? The occasion of the 90 -year birthday of professor emeritus Erik Cinthio has <b>afforded</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to reflect upon these two questions. Departure is taken in the 19 th century, when medieval churches first became a topic of interest for researchers and architects. Church archaeology developed as a sub-discipline of art history, but gradually the focus shifted and archaeological questions came more and more in the forefront. In the early 1960 s, Church archaeology became an integral part of Medieval archaeology (since 2005 Historical archaeology), a new academic discipline that was developed by professor Erik Cinthio at Lund University. In its 50 -year history, Church archaeology has undergone several changes when it comes to technical developments, research focus and theoretical approach. In the 1980 s and early 1990 s, churches were viewed in an economic and social context as a means of analysing medieval society, and in the last decade there has been a move towards studies of more immaterial aspects, such as the religious and ideological significance of church buildings. Church archaeology is now a mature discipline with theoretical depth and broad fields of research, but it may face problems in the future if some issues are not addressed. Churches are {{a vital part of the}} national heritage, but in today's secular and multicultural society, research about churches needs to be made relevant for new categories of people. This may be achieved by recognizing the uniqueness of churches as a source material. Churches have deep connections both to history and to the present time, and they relate to many key aspects of the human existence. Also Church archaeology cannot develop in isolation. It can only be strengthened and enriched through meetings and confrontations with neighbouring disciplines such as art history, theology, ethnology and history...|$|E
40|$|I {{was raised}} in Thunder Bay, a city in Ontario, on the {{northwest}} shore of Lake Superior. During university I studied in Sweden for one year in a university with 150 other exchange students from over 21 countries. Living in a foreign culture involved some expected challenges such as learning to read a new language, and many unexpected challenges, such as the time that I went to a phone store to buy a cell phone, and was surprised that no salespeople would speak to me. In my Canadian culture, salespeople in electronics stores often approach customers, or will offer their assistance when approached, {{and it took me}} a while to realize that this store was built on a different model. After much frustration, I deduced that to speak to a sales associate, I would have to take a ticket from a machine by the door, and wait until my number was signalled on a light-up board. Another time, in a grocery store when shopping with two German friends, one of the girls picked up a roll of garbage bags which she was planning on using to carry her groceries. When I asked why she was buying garbage bags when there were free grocery bags at the cash register, I found out that I?d been stealing grocery bags all year. My year in Sweden <b>afforded</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to experience acculturation (not to be confused with assimilation), a process of adjustment and coping within a different cultural context, and to observe the acculturation of my fellow exchange students (Berry, Kim, Minde & Mok, 1987). Without knowing any of the specific terminology or theories, I was fascinated with the different ways that other students functioned, from their food choices, to their selection of friends, social activities, and participation in sports and recreation. Some people lived in a foreign country as if they were still at home, surrounding themselves with friends from their own cultures and eating their traditional food, while others did the opposite, immersing themselves in the new culture, making friends with Swedish people, and there were also some who lived in isolation from all cultural groups, and others who ended up with a lifestyle that was a mix of cultures...|$|E
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDLocal and {{international}} pundits concur that education systems play {{a pivotal role}} in fostering and developing values in learners. In some countries, like South Africa, the values and rights enshrined in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights resonate in the Schools Act. As one of the concerns of education is nation building, my study investigates if the integration of the values does achieve tolerance and co-operation in the classroom by examining how learners make sense of values in the Mathematical Literacy curriculum. While I firmly believe that educational institutions have a responsibility to integrate positive values into all aspects of the school curriculum, it is my contention that learners cannot fully benefit from values specifically related to the Mathematical Literacy curriculum itself on their own. All stakeholders in education need to come together to establish an informed understanding of policy documents and reconcile the complexities and challenges that surround the transmission of values, so that educators will be able to assist learners in a meaningful way. The classroom life of a learner is intricately woven with that of the teacher. In order to unearth the views and practices of learners and teachers, I adopted a participatory approach. The qualitative study that ensued was conducted in three Mathematics Literacy classrooms at secondary schools in Cape Town, South Africa. The observation sessions <b>afforded</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to experience and appreciate how the teachers integrate values into the Mathematical Literacy lessons while observing learners‟ behaviour in the classroom. The interactions and interviews with both learners and teachers aided in further unravelling their understanding and implementation of values in the Mathematical Literacy lessons. For learners to develop into responsible, caring and morally just citizens who are capable of critical thought, they require an education that provides them with the necessary opportunities and tools to develop. Mathematical Literacy is able to provide learners with the relevant opportunities and thinking tools to construct meaning around moral concepts. I strongly believe that for learners to accomplish this goal, educators need to be appropriately capacitated to facilitate opportunities for their learners. I did not find any evidence in the literature that suggests a fail-safe theoretical approach to success in values education. I am of the opinion that for any measure of success in values education, a combination of these theories of learning and moral development has to be employed...|$|E
