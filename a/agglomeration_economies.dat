2500|$|A 2017 study {{argued that}} there were both {{positive}} and negative effects of inequality: [...] "When inequality is associated with political instability and social unrest, rent seeking and distortive policies, lower capacities for investment in human capital, and a stagnant domestic market, it is mostly expected to harm long-run economic performance, as suggested by many authors. Accordingly, improving income distribution is expected to foster long-run economic growth, especially in low-income countries where the levels of inequality are usually very high. However, some degree of inequality can also be good, as has been theoretically argued in the literature and as empirically suggested in this study. A degree of inequality can play a beneficial role for economic growth when that inequality is driven by market forces and related to hard work and growth-enhancing incentives like risk taking, innovation, capital investment, and <b>agglomeration</b> <b>economies.</b> The challenge for policy makers is to control structural inequality, which reduces the country’s capacities for economic development, {{while at the same time}} keeping in place those positive incentives that are also necessary for growth." ...|$|E

40|$|As cities play {{important}} roles in economic growth, the competitive power of foreign trade of cities has gained more and more attentions. Exporting hazard rate, as one dimension of foreign competitive power, shall be specifically measured. And its spatial distribution across cities shall be analyzed. However, few literatures investigates spatial distribution of export hazard rate. This paper estimates firm-level export hazard rates using the Cloglog model based on {{the data from the}} Annual Survey of Industrial Enterprises in China, and then aggregate them to city-level. We then analyze the impact of different factors on city-level export hazard rate using the spatial econometrical method. Empirical results show that minimum wage and <b>agglomeration</b> <b>economy</b> spatially affect city-level export hazard rate. Minimum wage significantly increases while <b>agglomeration</b> <b>economy</b> reduces a city 1 export harzard rate. However, the spatial relevance of minimum wage and <b>agglomeration</b> <b>economy</b> across space has accordingly significantly contrary impacts.

50|$|Increasing {{returns to}} scale, and economies of scale, are {{internal}} to a firm and may {{allow for the}} establishment of more of the same firm outside the area or region. Economies of scale external to a firm are the result of spatial proximity and are referred to as <b>agglomeration</b> <b>economies</b> of scale. <b>Agglomeration</b> <b>economies</b> may be external to a firm but internal to a region. It {{is important to note that}} these increasing returns to scale are a major contributing factor to the growth of cities. <b>Agglomeration</b> <b>economies</b> exist when production is cheaper because of this clustering of economic activity. As a result of this clustering it becomes possible to establish other businesses which may take advantage of these economies without joining any big organization.This process may help to urbanize areas as well.|$|E
50|$|Whilst {{localization}} and urbanization economies as well {{as their}} sources are crucial to sustaining <b>agglomeration</b> <b>economies</b> and cities, {{it is important to understand}} the long-term result of the function of <b>agglomeration</b> <b>economies</b> which relates to the core-periphery model. The core-periphery model basically features an amount of economic activity in one main area surrounded by a remote area of less dense activity. The concentration of this economic activity in one area (usually a city center) allows for the growth and expansion of activity into other and surrounding areas because of the cost-minimizing location decisions of firms within these <b>agglomeration</b> <b>economies</b> sustaining high productivity and advantages which therefore allow them to grow outside of the city (core) and into the periphery. A small decrease in the fixed cost of production can increase the range of locations for further establishment of firms leading to loss of concentration in the city and possibly the development of a new city outside the original city where agglomeration and increasing returns to scale existed.|$|E

40|$|Following {{an outline}} of the {{different}} types of <b>agglomeration</b> <b>economy,</b> consideration is given to transaction costs. Transaction costs may have a definite spatial dimension because institutional, commercial, cultural, and language characteristics are differentiated across the geographic space separating market agents. The concept of transaction space is introduced to represent the spatial differentiation of these characteristics, and this concept is used to cast light on how space can contribute to coordination and agency problems that raise transaction costs. Contractual agreements that are rearranged, so as to span a less heterogeneous transaction space, permit the reduction of transaction costs. Agglomeration can then be interpreted as an alternative to hierarchical structures within firms in economizing on transaction costs. The paper concludes with illustrations of how this framework may help to understand the spatial implications of corporate restructuring and new information technologies.

Los Angeles exemplifies urbanization economies in that it has no single dominant industry, yet continues to grow.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} agglomeration and firm-level performance in China. The author estimates firm-level production functions, total-factor productivity, and return on assets to compare the performance of heterogeneous firms {{within and outside the}} agglomeration. Agglomeration studies distinguish between localization regions characterized by a particular economic activity and urbanization, which corresponds to the development of overall economic activity. This paper investigates both types. Results suggest that negative localization economies exist in labor-intensive industries and positive urbanization economies are observed in capital-intensive industries. From the perspective of examining heterogeneous firms, negative localization effect is explained by the negative selection effect fewer highproductivity firms are clustered in the apparel and fiber industries and is explained by the negative <b>agglomeration</b> <b>economy</b> in the miscellaneous goods industry. The positive urbanization effect is explained by the agglomeration effect, i. e., the benefits of agglomeration serve all firms in the auto and communication equipment industries. Note that the productivity of Chinese firms in "Marshallian" localization clusters is not higher than that of firms located outside clusters. This finding challenges the theoretical prediction, prompting the need for further research. 特集　中国沿海部の産業集...|$|R
