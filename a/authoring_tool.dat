Originally {{authored}} by Dave Raggett in 1993, the browser continued its development at CERN and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and subsequently by Yggdrasil Computing.

30|$|It can {{be argued}} that studies on <b>authoring</b> <b>tools</b> for {{developing}} adaptive <b>authoring</b> <b>tools,</b> which help instructional designers to reuse and repackage existing LOs for their own instructional needs, are limited. In order to work with content packages easily and efficiently, Kavcic (2011) has emphasized the need for a range of tools that makes the preparation, arrangement, validation, and the play of the content packages easier. Also, in spite of the presence of a limited amount of <b>authoring</b> <b>tools,</b> <b>authoring</b> <b>tools</b> that allow the easy creation of LOs compatible with industry standards are required (Ramanathan et al. 2011). In his study, Watson (2010) suggested that teachers should be provided technical support when sharing, shuffling, reusing, and repurposing the existing LOs. In case teachers are provided with tools that allow them to create LOs with pedagogical influence without technical support, the necessity to design LOs to be reusable and modifiable will disappear.|$|R

While {{intelligent}} tutoring systems (ITSs), {{also called}} knowledge based tutors, {{are becoming more}} common and proving to be increasingly effective, each one must still be built from scratch at a significant cost.

A generic framework or "reference model " called KBT-MM (knowledge based tutor meta-model) for knowledge based tutor <b>authoring</b> <b>tools</b> is described. The reference model articulates a minimal but necessary set of features for knowledge based <b>authoring</b> <b>tools</b> that aim for scope, depth, learnability, and productivity. 1...|$|R
