5|$|During {{his presidential}} campaign, Morales had {{supported}} calls for regional <b>autonomy</b> for Bolivia's departments. As president, {{he changed his}} position, viewing the calls for <b>autonomy</b> – which came from Bolivia's four eastern departments of Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando, and Tarija – as {{an attempt by the}} wealthy bourgeoisie living in these regions to preserve their economic position. He nevertheless agreed to a referendum on regional <b>autonomy,</b> held in July 2006; the four eastern departments voted in favor of <b>autonomy,</b> but Bolivia as a whole voted against it by 57.6%. In September, <b>autonomy</b> activists launched strikes and blockades across eastern Bolivia, resulting in violent clashes with MAS activists. In January 2007, clashes in Cochabamba between activist groups led to fatalities, with Morales' government sending in troops to maintain the peace. The left-indigenous activists formed a Revolutionary Departmental Government, but Morales denounced it as illegal and continued to recognise the legitimacy of right-wing departmental head Manfred Reyes Villa.|$|E
5|$|Occupational <b>autonomy</b> is a {{key factor}} in regards to class positions.

5|$|After World War II, Croatia {{became a}} one-party Socialist federal {{unit of the}} Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Croatia was ruled by the Communists and enjoyed a degree of <b>autonomy</b> within the Yugoslav federation. In 1967, a group of Croatian authors and {{linguists}} published the Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language, demanding greater <b>autonomy</b> for the Croatian language. The declaration contributed to a national movement seeking greater civil rights and decentralization of the Yugoslav economy, culminating in the Croatian Spring of 1971, which was suppressed by Yugoslav leadership. The 1974 Yugoslav Constitution gave increased <b>autonomy</b> to federal units, essentially fulfilling a goal of the Croatian Spring and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, Croatia {{became a}} single-party socialist federal {{unit of the}} SFR Yugoslavia, ruled by the Communists, but enjoying a degree of <b>autonomy</b> within the federation. In 1967, Croatian authors and {{linguists}} published a Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Standard Language demanding greater <b>autonomy</b> for Croatian language. The declaration contributed to a national movement seeking greater civil rights and decentralization of the Yugoslav economy, culminating in the Croatian Spring of 1971, suppressed by Yugoslav leadership. Still, the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution gave increased <b>autonomy</b> to federal units, basically fulfilling a goal of the Croatian Spring, and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents.|$|E

5|$|Notably, {{during the}} 1960s, the Soviet General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev asked the {{communist}} leader of Albania Enver Hoxha about giving <b>autonomy</b> to the minority, but this initiative was without any result. The <b>autonomy</b> question {{remains one of}} the main issues on the diplomatic agenda in Albanian-Greek relations, {{after the collapse of the}} communist regime in Albania (1991). Moreover, a certain degree of <b>autonomy,</b> based on the terms of the Protocol of Corfu, is the main objective of the organization Omonoia, as well as the Unity for Human Rights Party, which represents the Greek minority in the Albanian government. Such proposals were rejected in 1991 by the Albanian government, thus spurring Omonoia's radical wing to call for Union with Greece. In another incident, in 1993, Omonoia’s chairman was immediately arrested by the Albanian police, after explaining in public that the goal of the Greek minority was <b>autonomy</b> inside the Albanian borders, based on the terms of the Protocol.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{recommended}} {{the book for}} public educators as {{an important contribution to}} liberal theory. Their common criticism was based around practical applications and the imposition of <b>autonomy</b> as a value, e.g., her contemporary examples of national civics education, how citizens who disagreed with the focus on <b>autonomy</b> could be accommodated, and how a weak perfectionist state could defend marginalized group interests in a public school setting.|$|E
5|$|The Demands of Liberal Education is a 1999 {{political}} philosophy book by Meira Levinson that establishes a liberal political theory of children's education that fits the mutual {{needs of the}} state and its diverse citizenry. She writes that the intent of a liberal education—an education that follows from a liberal society's values—is to maximize the <b>autonomy</b> of individual children through increasing their capacity for liberty. Levinson argues <b>autonomy</b> as a right to children. The book, published by Oxford University Press, aims to address a lacuna between educational policy and liberal political theory.|$|E

5|$|The Muslim {{conquest of}} the city {{solidified}} the Arab control over Palestine, control which would not again be threatened until the First Crusade in the late 11th century. Thus, {{it came to be}} regarded as a holy site by Islam, as well as by Christianity and Judaism. This stabilized control of Palestina Prima. In 613, the Jewish revolt against the Byzantine Heraclius culminated with the conquest of Jerusalem in 614 by Persian and Jewish forces and establishment of Jewish <b>autonomy.</b> The revolt ended with the departure of the Persians and also ended 15years of Jewish <b>autonomy.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{plan for}} <b>autonomy</b> was not {{accomplished}} at this time, but the Seimas {{was an important}} development in the Lithuanian bid for independence. It consolidated efforts, spearheaded the organization of political parties, strengthened national conscience, and energized the rural populace. The assembly resolutely rejected ideas to restore the old Grand Duchy of Lithuania {{and for the first}} time voiced the demands for <b>autonomy.</b> Many of the political and religious rights that were granted by the October Manifesto were retained. A number of agricultural, educational, scientific, literary and artistic societies emerged.|$|E

5|$|Those {{parts of}} the {{memorandum}} that demanded Lithuanian <b>autonomy</b> and protested the possible attachment of Suwałki Governorate to autonomous Poland were reprinted in the Russian publication Pravitel'stvennyi Vestnik on November 23 (November 10 O.S.). The Russian government sought to demonstrate that granting <b>autonomy</b> to both Poland and Lithuania would be complicated, and would probably exacerbate national conflicts. On November 26 (November 13 O.S.) the memorandum was also reprinted in Vilniaus žinios. It was heavily criticized by non-Lithuanians for its position on minorities and by Lithuanians for making demands {{on behalf of the}} Lithuanian nation without waiting for the Seimas' resolutions.|$|E

5|$|In February 1952, Baxter became deputy-director of the university. He {{defeated}} Arthur Denning in {{an election}} for director in December, assuming the position on 1 January 1953. As Denning had argued for the retention of the university's links with the Public Service Board, it was widely seen as {{a victory for the}} proponents of <b>autonomy,</b> but with his industrial background Baxter had little in common with the professors who came from academia, and did not share their views on the role and organisation of a university. The university did receive <b>autonomy</b> on 1 July 1954, and when traditional university titles were adopted in 1955, Baxter became vice-chancellor.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1877–78 Russo-Turkish War, Khrimian led the Armenian delegation at the Congress of Berlin. The delegation's mission was to present a memorandum to the great powers concerning the implementation of reforms in the Armenian provinces of the Ottoman Empire. The delegation's main goal was to secure substantial reforms in the Armenian provinces that would be supervised by European powers—which meant Russia in reality, as its troops where stationed in parts of Armenia. Armenians hoped that Russian pressure (and threat of intervention) would force the Ottoman government to improve conditions in the Armenian provinces. The Armenian delegation furthermore demanded some form of <b>autonomy</b> for the Armenian provinces, similar to the Maronite <b>autonomy</b> in Mount Lebanon, but did not advocate breakup of the Ottoman Empire or annexation of the Armenian provinces into Russia.|$|E
