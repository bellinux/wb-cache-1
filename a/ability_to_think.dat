There {{he received a}} traditional education, including mastery of fanorona, a local board game believed to develop intelligence and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> strategically. Young nobles being groomed for leadership roles typically learned to perform kabary (a stylized form of public address), including the judicious use of ohabolana (proverbs) to persuasively make a point. Young Merina princes also often learned to play the valiha, a bamboo tube zither then reserved for Merina and Zafimamy nobles. Around the age of 12, Ramboasalamarazaka continued his education {{under the supervision of}} his grandfather, King Andriambelomasina, at Amboatany and the royal court in Ambohimanga.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} plan and strategize, much like {{abstract}} thinking, {{can be seen in}} the more diversified toolkit of the Middle Stone Age, as well as in the subsistence patterns of the period. As MSA hominins began to migrate into a range of different ecological zones, it became necessary to base hunting strategies around seasonally available resources. Awareness of seasonality is evident in the faunal remains found at temporary sites. In less forgiving ecological zones, this awareness would have been essential for survival and the {{ability to plan}} subsistence strategies based on this awareness demonstrates an <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> beyond the present tense and act upon this knowledge.|$|E
5|$|The {{executive}} {{function of the}} brain is the set of cognitive processes that allow the cognitive control of behavior: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions include the ability to filter information and tune out irrelevant stimuli with attentional control and cognitive inhibition, the ability to process and manipulate information held in working memory, the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about multiple concepts simultaneously and switch tasks with cognitive flexibility, the ability to inhibit impulses and prepotent responses with inhibitory control, {{and the ability to}} determine the relevance of information or appropriateness of an action. Higher order {{executive function}}s, require multiple cognitive processes including planning, reasoning, and problem solving.|$|E

5|$|Hand {{graduated}} from Harvard Law School in 1896 {{at the age}} of 24. He returned to Albany to live with his mother and aunt, and started work for the law firm in which an uncle, Matthew Hale, was a partner. Hale's unexpected death a few months later obliged Hand to move to a new firm, but by 1899, he had become a partner. He had difficulty attracting his own clients, however, and found the work trivial and dull. Much of his time was spent researching and writing briefs, with few opportunities for the appellate work he preferred. His early courtroom appearances, when they came, were frequently difficult, sapping his fragile self-confidence. He began to fear that he lacked the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> on his feet in court.|$|E
5|$|In the yeshiva world, the {{brightest}} students are highly desirable as chavrusas. However, there are {{pros and cons}} to learning with chavrusas who are stronger, weaker, or equal in knowledge and ability to the student. A stronger chavrusa will correct and fill in the student's knowledge and help him improve his learning techniques, acting more like a teacher. With a chavrusa who is equal in knowledge and ability, the student is forced to prove his point with logic rather than by right of seniority, which improves his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> logically, analyze other people's opinions objectively, and accept criticism. With a weaker chavrusa, who often worries over and questions each step, the student is forced to understand the material thoroughly, refine and organize his thoughts in a logical structure, present his viewpoint clearly, {{and be ready to}} justify each and every point. The stronger chavrusa helps the student acquire a great deal of information, but the weaker chavrusa helps the student learn how to learn. Yeshiva students are usually advised to have one of each of these three types of chavrusas in order to develop on all three levels.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{employed a}} mixed-methods design {{to ascertain the}} perceptions of elementary schoolteachers {{in relation to the}} impact the Common Core State Standards had on their students 2 ̆ 7 <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> critically. The participants were teachers from three schools within the same district in western North Carolina. Quantitative data were collected via a 5 -point Likert scale survey distributed via Survey Monkey. Qualitative data were collected via open-ended questions and focus group interviews. The data were collected to answer the research question, 2 ̆ 2 What is the impact of the Common Core State Standards on the critical thinking abilities of students? 2 ̆ 2 The researcher designed the survey around the characteristics of a critical thinker developed by Dr. Robert Ennis. Focus group questions were developed following an analysis of survey and open-ended responses. Data analysis entailed applying the chi square goodness of fit test, determining cumulative percentages and mean responses, as well as coding for themes based on a researcher-created strength code. The researcher found participants in this study believed the Common Core State Standards had a positive impact on their students 2 ̆ 7 <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> critically. Recommendations for future research include conducting a study after the standards have been in place {{for a longer period of}} time.

Wheeler (2010) also found that the use of social media in a classroom contributes to reflective learning which implies that students develop <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> critically about what they have learnt thereby being able to “apply previous learning to new situations” (Wheeler, 2010 : 106). Similarly, Deng and Yuen (2011) who upon surveying student teachers’ experiences with the integration of a weblog during their practicum, found that blogs supported self-expression and self-reflection, as well as social interaction and reflective dialogue.|$|R

25|$|In {{studying}} adolescent development, adolescence can {{be defined}} biologically, as the physical transition marked by the onset of puberty and the termination of physical growth; cognitively, as changes in the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> abstractly and multi-dimensionally; or socially, as a period of preparation for adult roles. Major pubertal and biological changes include changes to the sex organs, height, weight, and muscle mass, as well as major changes in brain structure and organization. Cognitive advances encompass both increment in knowledge and in the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> abstractly and to reason more effectively. The study of adolescent development often involves interdisciplinary collaborations. For example, researchers in neuroscience or bio-behavioral health might focus on pubertal changes in brain structure {{and its effects on}} cognition or social relations. Sociologists interested in adolescence might focus on the acquisition of social roles (e.g., worker or romantic partner) and how this varies across cultures or social conditions. Developmental psychologists might focus on changes in relations with parents and peers as a function of school structure and pubertal status. Some scientists have questioned the universality of adolescence as a developmental phase, and argue that traits often considered typical of adolescents are not inherent.|$|E
