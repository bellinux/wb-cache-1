5|$|Prices for pelts {{have varied}} {{considerably}} {{over the past}} 100 years. They were highest in the 1920s and 1930s, when <b>average</b> <b>prices</b> were about $100 US. In 1936, pelts were being offered for sale in New York City for $450–750 per pelt. Prices declined through the 1960s but picked up again in the late 1970s. In 1979, the Hudson's Bay Company paid $410 for one female pelt. In 1999, 16,638 pelts were sold in Canada for $449,307 (CAN) at an average price of $27.|$|E

25|$|In March 2010, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission {{released}} a report sharply critical of price gouging at Sydney airport, ranking it fifth out of five airports. The report noted Sydney Airport recorded the highest <b>average</b> <b>prices</b> at $13.63 per passenger, compared to the lowest of $7.96 at Melbourne Airport, while the price of short-term parking had almost doubled in the 2008–09 financial year, from $28 to $50 for four hours. The report also accused the airport of abusing its monopoly power.|$|E
25|$|Kiev is {{the undisputed}} center of {{business}} and commerce of Ukraine and home to the country's largest companies, such as Naftogaz Ukrainy, Energorynok and Kyivstar. In 2010 the city accounted for 18% of national retail sales and 24% of all construction activity. Indeed, real estate {{is one of the}} major forces in Kiev's economy. <b>Average</b> <b>prices</b> of apartments are the highest in the country and among the highest in eastern Europe. Kiev also ranks high in terms of commercial real estate for it is here where the country's tallest office buildings (such as Gulliver and Parus) and some of Ukraine's biggest shopping malls (such as Dream Town and Ocean Plaza) are located.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that fair trade farmers get higher prices on average. Anecdotes state that farmers were paid more or less by traders than by Fairtrade cooperatives. Few of these anecdotes address the problems of price reporting in developing world markets, and few appreciate the complexity of the different price packages {{which may or may not}} include credit, harvesting, transport, processing, etc. Cooperatives typically <b>average</b> <b>prices</b> over the year, so they pay less than traders at some times, more at others. Bassett (2009) is able to compare prices only where Fairtrade and non-Fairtrade farmers have to sell cotton to the same monopsonistic ginneries which pay low prices. Prices would have to be higher to compensate farmers for the increased costs they incur to produce Fairtrade. For instance, Fairtrade encouraged Nicaraguan farmers to switch to organic coffee, which resulted in a higher price per pound, but a lower net income because of higher costs and lower yields.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, a year {{of strong}} {{economic}} activity and robust competition in the grocery market, prices in Houston's grocery stores were below the national <b>average</b> <b>prices</b> in grocery stores. Houston's grocery price index averaged at 85.6, {{below the national average}} of 88.4. This means that, for the 1982-1984 base period, Houstonians paid $88.40 for an amount of food that would cost $100 according to the national average. During the oil bust and the economic decline, Houston's prices stayed even with the national average. In 1983 Houston's grocery index increased from 96.8 to 99.4 and matched the national average of 99.1. As the city began to recover, the prices began to edge upward. When a recession in the U.S. began and while Houston's economic growth slowed and continued, the national price index fell below Houston's price index. As of 1992 prices in Houston's grocery stores were higher than the national average; Houston's index averaged to be 137.3, and the national average was 132.3.|$|E

2500|$|In 1884 Charles H. Dow began {{tracking}} stocks, initially {{beginning with}} 11 stocks, mostly railroads, {{and looked at}} <b>average</b> <b>prices</b> for these eleven. When the average [...] "peaks and troughs" [...] went up consistently, he deemed it a bull market condition; if averages dropped, it was a bear market. He added up prices, and divided {{by the number of}} stocks to get his Dow Jones average. Dow's numbers were a [...] "convenient benchmark" [...] for analyzing the market and became an accepted way to look at the entire stock market. In 1889 the original stock report, Customers' Afternoon Letter, became The Wall Street Journal. Named in reference to the actual street, it became an influential international daily business newspaper published in New York City. After October 7, 1896, it began publishing Dow's expanded list of stocks. A century later, there were 30 stocks in the average.|$|E

60|$|Having now {{formed a}} general {{idea of the}} modes in which credit is made {{available}} {{as a substitute for}} money, we have to consider in what manner the use of these substitutes affects the value of money, or, what is equivalent, the prices of commodities. It is hardly necessary to say that the permanent value of money—the natural and <b>average</b> <b>prices</b> of commodities—are not in question here. These are determined by the cost of producing or of obtaining the precious metals. An ounce of gold or silver will in the long run exchange for as much of every other commodity as can be produced or imported at the same cost with itself. And an order, or note of hand, or bill payable at sight, for an ounce of gold, while the credit of the giver is unimpaired, is worth neither more nor less than the gold itself.|$|E

5000|$|Another useful {{benchmark}} is the <b>average</b> <b>price</b> {{that customers}} pay for brands {{in a given}} category. This average can be calculated {{in at least two}} ways: (1) as the ratio of total category revenue to total category unit sales, or (2) as the unit-share weighted <b>average</b> <b>price</b> in the category. Note that the market <b>Average</b> <b>Price</b> Paid includes the brand under consideration. Note also that changes in unit shares will affect the <b>average</b> <b>price</b> paid. If a low-price brand steals shares from a higher-priced rival, the <b>average</b> <b>price</b> paid will decline. This would cause a firm’s price premium (calculated using the <b>average</b> <b>price</b> paid as a benchmark) to rise, even if its absolute price did not change. Similarly, if a brand is priced at a premium, that premium will decline as it gains share. The reason: a market share gain by a premium-priced brand will cause the overall <b>average</b> <b>price</b> paid in its market to rise. This, in turn, will reduce the price differential between that brand and the market average[...] [...] [...] To calculate the price premium using the <b>average</b> <b>price</b> paid benchmark, managers can also divide a brand’s share of the market in value terms by its share in volume terms. If value and volume market shares are equal, there is no premium. If value share is greater than volume share, then there is a positive price premium.|$|R
50|$|The {{success of}} these {{strategies}} is usually measured by comparing the <b>average</b> <b>price</b> at which the entire order was executed with the <b>average</b> <b>price</b> achieved through a benchmark execution for the same duration.

At times, the execution price is also compared {{with the price of}} the instrument at the time of placing the order.|$|R

50|$|The post-trade process {{involves}} first {{recording the}} data from previous trading periods, including trade timing, arrival <b>price,</b> <b>average</b> execution <b>price,</b> and relevant details about market movement.

Implementation shortfall is a commonly targeted benchmark, which is the sum of all explicit and implicit costs. Sometimes, an opportunity cost of not transacting is factored in.
