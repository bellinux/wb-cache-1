5|$|In this installment, Link gains {{experience}} {{points to}} upgrade his attack, magic, and life by defeating enemies. This feature is exclusive to Zelda II {{in the game}} series. He can raise each of these attributes {{to a maximum of}} eight levels. Raising a life level will decrease the damage Link receives when hit, raising a magic level will decrease the magic points (MP) cost of spells, and raising an attack level will strengthen his sword's offensive power. Each <b>attribute</b> requires a different amount of experience to level up, with the life level requiring the least number of points to level and attack requiring the most. When enough points are acquired to raise an <b>attribute,</b> the player may choose to level up that <b>attribute</b> or to cancel and continue gaining experience points towards the next level in another <b>attribute.</b> Once Link has raised an <b>attribute</b> to the maximum level of eight, further advances in that <b>attribute</b> will earn Link an extra life, without advancing the <b>attribute</b> itself. Link begins the game with four Heart Containers and four Magic Containers and can acquire up to four more of each, permanently increasing his life points and magic points respectively. Other games in The Legend of Zelda series only allow Link to increase his strength through new weapons, items, and Heart Containers. Certain enemies drain Link's experience when they attack, but he will never lose a level once raised. When a game ends or is saved, the cartridge records Link's current ability levels and the number of experience points required for the next increase, but resets his accumulated points to zero.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} morph the dragon {{to change its}} attack, defense, agility and spiritual attributes. Boosting one <b>attribute</b> diminishes another; for example, {{boosting}} the attack <b>attribute</b> reduces the spiritual <b>attribute,</b> meaning berserks require more BP, while boosting means gauges fill faster {{at the expense of}} defense. Certain berserks are only available in certain dragon configurations.|$|E

30|$|<b>Attributes</b> are the {{characteristics}} of a product or service. Generally, they can be classified into concrete <b>attributes</b> and abstract <b>attributes.</b> Concrete <b>attributes</b> are the tangible and objective aspects of a product that can be directly measured, experienced by touch or perceived by eye. Color, size, and price are <b>attributes</b> of this kind. Abstract <b>attributes</b> are the intangible and subjective aspects of a product, such as services and reputation, which are determined subjectively or by individual feeling. Kotler and Armstrong (1999) mentioned consumers view every product as a collective of some <b>attributes.</b> By choosing preferred <b>attributes,</b> consumers can obtain the desired consequences. Therefore, <b>attributes</b> are the cornerstone of the means-end chain.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role that}} social <b>attributes</b> [...] environmental and labour conditions [...] play in product choice {{across a range of}} developed and emerging economies. We use a multi-attribute design to force consumers to not only trade-off social <b>attributes</b> with tangible <b>attributes</b> but also make trade-offs with other intangible <b>attributes,</b> namely brand and country of origin. Our results show that: (1) social <b>attributes</b> are generally more influential in developed than in emerging economies, (2) the importance of social <b>attributes</b> holds across high and low involvement products, and (3) social <b>attributes</b> can influence product choice even when other intangible <b>attributes</b> are included in the design. We believe that our results offer a more accurate picture of the role of social <b>attributes</b> since they are based on a multi-cue, multi-product design that forced consumers to make tradeoffs between tangible and intangible <b>attributes.</b> Brand evaluation Choice modelling Country of origin Environmentalism Labour issues Social product <b>attributes...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we suggest}} a {{framework}} for security and dependability metrics {{that is based on}} a number of non-functional system <b>attributes.</b> The <b>attributes</b> are the traditional security <b>attributes</b> (the “CIA”) and a set of dependability <b>attributes.</b> Based on a system model, we group those <b>attributes</b> into protective <b>attributes</b> and behavioural <b>attributes</b> and propose that metrication should be done in accordance. We also discuss the dependence between these two sets of <b>attributes</b> and how it affects the corresponding metrics. The metrics themselves are only defined to a limited degree. The concepts of security and dependability largely reflect the same basic system meta-property and are partly overlapping. We claim that the suggested approach will facilitate making quantitative assessment of the integrated concept of security and dependability as reflected by those <b>attributes...</b>|$|R
