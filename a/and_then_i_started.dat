500|$|Killen drew {{inspiration}} from the dreaming process: [...] "The concept of the way your dreams feel real, the way you seem to experience them as something that you don't blink at until something crazy happens that sort of bursts that balloon. I think I {{became interested in the}} question of what if nothing ever popped that balloon? What if you couldn't tell the difference between when you were awake and when you were asleep? <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> {{looking for a way to}} marry those two ideas up, and a few months later we had Awake." ...|$|E
500|$|... totally rave-y... and that's the feeling, just music rushing over you, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> {{thinking}} about drugs and addiction {{and love and}} how that's an addiction... we've all lived {{the ups and downs}} of being in a toxic relationship. It's really about the obstacles of trying to let it go, but at the same time how great it makes you feel, so it's hard to let it go. Again, it goes back to a story that we all can relate to... It's not Rihanna's story; it's her story in the video, and she's acting. But everybody's [...] Obviously, there's a lot of comparisons to her real life, and that's not at all the intention. It's just that I guess people naturally go there because art imitates life, and it's a story we all relate to and we've all experienced. Like, it's based on my life; it's based on her life; it's based on your life, like, everybody.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2009 Interview with New York Music News, Simon {{explained}} how {{she came to}} record electronic music: [...] "At the beginning, I was writing my songs with the piano and the guitar and writing the lyrics and the music. [...] <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> using the computer just, you know, to record. [...] So that's how I started the production side...".|$|E
5000|$|All of the singer-songwriters, and the {{way they}} married their lyrics and their phrasing with their instrumentation. I listen to James Taylor and Bob Dylan... Stevie Wonder. I listen to Ryan Adams, Band of Horses... <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> to think about my second album! Brendan James ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I was at {{home with}} my mother and {{suddenly}} I had a vision. I could see inside my mother's body and <b>I</b> <b>started</b> telling her about the organs I could see. Now, I have to switch from my regular vision to what I call medical vision. For a fraction of a second, I see a colorful picture inside the person <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> to analyze it." [...] says Demkina ...|$|R
5000|$|... ‘I {{have the}} feeling of always being rehearsing. <b>I</b> {{practice}} <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> creating. <b>I</b> want to experiment <b>and</b> <b>then</b> be sure of what I am doing. What I do, I do it guiding myself through my interests of the moment, and I am drawn to people. I love them. They are fascinating. I love how {{you can create a}} time of making a picture and understand what the person you are photographing is giving to you.’ ...|$|R
2500|$|Cartwright said, [...] "When I was younger, I {{saw myself}} as a batting all-rounder, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> taking a few wickets and people started saying, ‘’Oh you’re a bowling all-rounder’’ because I was out of form with my batting. So it was quite hard {{to try to keep}} the idea of {{myself as a}} batting all-rounder in my own mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Reichs was {{an expert}} witness in the Casey Anthony murder trial. After {{initially}} refusing {{to be a part}} of Anthony's defense, she cited biased media coverage as the reason she changed her mind. [...] “Initially, I said no, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> seeing media coverage and it made me angry. This woman needed to be tried in court, not in the press.” Reichs did a full skeletal analysis of Anthony's daughter, Caylee, but could not determine a cause of death. [...] She concluded that there was no evidence of abuse and that the child appeared to be well-nourished.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Binau's nine-year-old son Andy (Anders) {{handed her}} a book called Max the Super Dog's Pet Shop Adventures. Andy said {{that he wanted to}} give his mother a helping hand: [...] "My mother had created a book about cancer for the adults in the hospitals. So I thought that {{there was a lack of}} a book for children, who must lose one they care about, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> to do it." [...] This booklet, about a 'superpup', was created as an {{activity}} book to be given as a gift for hospitalized children. It later became an important part of a donation program, the AngelKID Heart Package (HJERTEPAKKE package), for children who have a terminally ill relative.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I've done dealt. It's up to you-all to play. But while you're deliberating, I {{want to give}} you-all a warning: if {{that door}} opens and any one of you cusses lets on there's {{anything}} unusual, right here <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> sure <b>start</b> plugging. They ain't a soul'll get out the room except feet first." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I was out really {{late and}} {{walking to the}} tempo of my own rhythm, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> just <b>started</b> singing, 'Carmen, Carmen doesn’t have a problem lying to herself cause her liquor’s top shelf.' And {{it was an easy}} cadence. The whole thing just came, and I think I was in a really good place then, so it was like things...it was really easy to channel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All the morning," [...] Sophy replied. [...] "I {{took the}} dogs out, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> on your housekeeping-book and the bills. Your checks {{will have to}} be larger than ever this month, Louise, and I don't see how you can {{possibly}} draw them unless you go and see your bankers first." ...|$|E
60|$|Quicker and quicker danced the dust. The moonbeams {{seemed to}} quiver {{as they went}} by me into the mass of gloom beyond. More and more they {{gathered}} till they seemed to take dim phantom shapes. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started,</b> broad awake and in full possession of my senses, and ran screaming from the place.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Eight {{hundred and}} sixty dollars,' said he. 'Let me tell you. He was in. He looked me over and began to guy me. I didn't say a word, but got out the walnut shells and began to roll the little ball on the table. I whistled a tune or two, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> up the old formula.|$|E
60|$|The climb {{through the}} woods promised to be a hard one, so I left {{everything}} behind except rod, reel, and fly-book. My coat was hung on the nearest bush; the landing-net lay in the shade across a rock, {{the end of the}} handle wedged under a root, and I dropped my two trout into that and covered them from the sun with ferns <b>and</b> moss. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> off {{through the woods}} for the little pond.|$|R
5000|$|About {{the process}} of writing songs, Cetera has said, I'm like the very bad student who only studies the day before a test! I only tend to write songs when I have a purpose - I need to know that I'm going to do a new album, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> would <b>start</b> writing. There are not a lot of Peter Cetera songs lying around, because I don't really write a lot of things when I'm not {{expected}} to do an album! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{made some}} reciprocative speech, which, {{if it was}} {{somewhat}} awkwardly expressed, had at least the merit of earnestness, and my eyes followed her admiringly as {{she walked to the}} door and disappeared with a backward glance <b>and</b> a smile. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>and</b> coloured, to find that Mr. Ravenor was watching me.|$|R
6000|$|I {{replied that}} I {{had met with}} the [...] "bold girl" [...] purely by accident, on her side {{as well as on}} mine; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> a new topic. [...] "Was it a {{pleasant}} dinner-party last night?" [...] I asked--as if the subject really interested me. I had not been quite four and twenty hours in England yet, and I was becoming a humbug already.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] Ned {{said after}} a pause; [...] "I seem to know that some one said that Mr. Mulready was dead, and some one thought that I had killed him, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> {{to come over to}} give myself up. Oh! yes, I {{remember}} that, and then there was an examination before the magistrates. I remember it all; but it seems just {{as if it had been}} a dream." ...|$|E
6000|$|I ruminated {{for hours}} on Mr. Clement's praise. I read and re-read my [...] "able article" [...] till I knew it by heart <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> in, seriously, to {{understand}} and estimate the school of fiction to which Mr. Howells belonged. I read {{every one of his}} books as soon as I could obtain them. I read James, too, and many of the European realists, but it must have been two years before I called upon Mr. Clement to redeem his promise.|$|E
5000|$|Right before {{beginning}} to write, she asks herself three questions: [...] "What {{is the story}} about; what is my attitude toward the story; and what is my purpose for writing it?" [...] Then, she {{comes up with a}} theme statement in three sentences that is attached to her computer screen. After that, she writes a timeline and plans characters. When she finally gets to writing the book, she says, [...] "I have an idea for the <b>start</b> <b>and</b> end <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> just <b>start</b> writing." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster (born 30 June 1965, in Strasbourg) is a French {{artist and}} an {{influential}} figure in international contemporary art. She {{is known for}} her great variety of work in video projection, photography, and spatial installations. She has worked in landscaping, design, and writing. [...] "I always look for experimental processes. I {{like the fact that}} at the beginning I don't know how to do things <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> slowly, <b>I</b> <b>start</b> learning. Often exhibitions don't give me this learning possibility anymore." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I worked {{part time}} at the shop to earn a nickel or dime," [...] Trickle said. [...] "At that age, it was mostly {{sweeping}} the shop, but <b>I</b> <b>started</b> {{to play with the}} welder and soon I could make an arc <b>and</b> <b>then</b> weld. <b>I</b> <b>started</b> junking machinery. <b>I</b> save some things getting a head <b>start</b> for when <b>I</b> would go racing at 16. I didn't have any money, but I had this pile of stuff to build a race car with. It was a hope chest.|$|R
6000|$|After that I {{must have}} fallen asleep from very weariness. My head glided back upon the reticule, and I dozed uneasily until morning. Every now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> in my sleep, but the murderers hung back. When I awoke it was eight o'clock, and the dollars were still safe under my head. I rose wearily, washed myself, and {{arranged}} the tumbled clothes in which I had slept, for my portmanteau {{had not yet}} arrived from the Depôt. Next, I put back the bed and mattress, and then I took the dollars and went downstairs to the bar, hardly knowing whether to laugh at my last night's terror, or to congratulate myself on my lucky escape from a den of robbers. At {{the foot of the}} stairs, whom should I come across but Lucretia herself! ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was still}} {{another day of}} hay-making, but we couldn't wait for that, because our cycles had come from London and we was all anxious to be off, {{and you would have}} laughed, madam, if you could have seen us start. Mr. Poplington went off well enough, but Jone's bicycle seemed a little gay and hard to manage, and he frisked about a good deal at starting; but Jone had bought a bicycle long ago, when the things first came out, and on days when the roads was good he used to go to the post-office on it, and he said that if a man had ever ridden on top of a wheel about six feet high he {{ought to be able to}} balance himself on the pair of small wheels which they use nowadays. So, after getting his long legs into working order, he went very well, though with a snaky {{movement}} at first, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started.</b>|$|E
60|$|She gave {{me another}} {{dose of the}} medicine, made me drink two cups of coffee, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> out with all {{despatch}} for the House of the Lions. As I turned into the Rue Chartres I saw ahead of me four horses, with their bridles bunched and held by a negro lad, waiting in the street. Yes, they were {{in front of the}} house. There it was, with its solid green gates between the lions, its yellow walls with the fringe of peeping magnolias and oranges, with its green-latticed gallery from which Monsieur Auguste had let himself down after stealing the miniature. I knocked at the wicket, the same gardienne answered the call, smiled, led me through the cool, paved archway which held in its frame the green of the court beyond, and up the stairs with the quaint balustrade which I had mounted five years before to meet Philippe de St. Gre. As I reached the gallery Madame la Vicomtesse, gowned in brown linen for riding, rose quickly from her chair and came forward to meet me.|$|E
5000|$|Gord Lownds {{was born}} and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy from York University and an MBA from the University of Toronto.In an {{interview}} with Business Edge News Magazine, Lownds describes his early career, [...] "I started working at 15 as a barker at a carnival, and found out at that point that I enjoyed working. I was also a professional rock musician for a couple of years, playing bass <b>and</b> guitar. <b>Then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> my legitimate business career with Consumers Distributing in 1970 in a warehouse and worked my way up to the management team there." ...|$|R
5000|$|On June 2, 2016, [...] "Wow" [...] (sometimes stylized as [...] "WOW") was {{released}} {{as the second}} single and it was confirmed the new album {{was scheduled to be}} released October 21, 2016. That release date was later delayed and scrubbed from Beck's PR site with no explanation given. Beck told KROQ that [...] "Wow" [...] "was completely {{off the top of my}} head. I didn't write any of it. It was just us fooling around in the studio. I didn't even mean to release it. I was working on another song and came up with the riff <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> just <b>started</b> freestyling."

50|$|With Athens 1910 a failure, {{the faith}} in Athens diminished, {{and as a result}} Athens 1914 got even less support. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> World War <b>I</b> <b>started,</b> <b>and</b> any further Intercalated Games had to wait until after the war. But after the war was over it had been more than a decade since Athens 1906, and the idea of Intercalated Games was given up entirely.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly. You wouldn't {{have had}} me be abrupt, would you? I {{went into his}} private office and found him alone. I think at first {{he would have been}} just as well pleased if I had retired. In fact, he said as much. But I soon {{adjusted}} that outlook. I took a seat and a cigarette, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> to sketch out for him the history of my connection with the firm. He began to wilt {{before the end of the}} first ten minutes. At the quarter of an hour mark he was looking at me like a lost dog that's just found its owner. By the half-hour he was making little bleating noises and massaging my coat-sleeve. And when, after perhaps an hour and a half, I came to my peroration and suggested a rise, he choked back a sob, gave me double what I had asked, and invited me to dine at his club next Tuesday. I'm a little sorry now I cut the thing so short. A few minutes more, and I fancy he would have given me his sock-suspenders and made over his life-insurance in my favour." ...|$|E
60|$|Full of the {{enjoyment}} of the moment, giddy with the wildness of animal spirits, so rapturous in a boy, I capered, I danced, I played a thousand fantastic tricks about the stage, in the villages in which we exhibited; and I was universally pronounced the most agreeable monster that had ever been seen in those parts. My disappearance from school had awakened my father's anxiety; for I one day heard a description of myself cried before the very booth in which I was exhibiting; with the offer of a reward for any intelligence of me. I had no great scruple about letting my father suffer a little uneasiness on my account; it would punish him for past indifference, and would make him value me the more when he found me again. I have wondered that some of my comrades did not recognize in me the stray sheep that was cried; but they were all, no doubt, occupied by their own concerns. They were all laboring seriously in their antic vocations, for folly was a mere trade with the most of them, and they often grinned and capered with heavy hearts. With me, on the contrary, it was all real. I acted con amore, and rattled and laughed from the irrepressible gayety of my spirits. It is true that, now <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> <b>started</b> and looked grave on receiving a sudden thwack from the wooden sword of Harlequin, {{in the course of}} my gambols; as it brought to mind the birch of my school-master. But I soon got accustomed to it; and bore all the cuffing, and kicking, and tumbling about, that form the practical wit of your itinerant pantomime, with a good humor that made me a prodigious favorite.|$|E
60|$|At length the heralds and {{forerunners}} of {{the royal}} sun had done their work, and, searching out the shadows, had caused them to flee away. Then up he came in glory from his ocean-bed, and flooded the earth with warmth and light. I {{sat there in the}} boat listening to the gentle lapping of the water and watched him rise, till presently the slight drift of the boat brought the odd-shaped rock, or peak, {{at the end of the}} promontory which we had weathered with so much peril, between me and the majestic sight, and blotted it from my view. I still continued, however, to stare at the rock, absently enough, till presently it became edged with the fire of the growing light behind it, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>started,</b> as well I might, for I perceived that the top of the peak, which was about eighty feet high by one hundred and fifty feet thick at its base, was shaped like a negro's head and face, whereon was stamped a most fiendish and terrifying expression. There was no doubt about it; there were the thick lips, the fat cheeks, and the squat nose standing out with startling clearness against the flaming background. There, too, was the round skull, washed into shape perhaps by thousands of years of wind and weather, and, to complete the resemblance, there was a scrubby growth of weeds or lichen upon it, which against the sun looked for all the world like the wool on a colossal negro's head. It certainly was very odd; so odd that now I believe it is not a mere freak of nature but a gigantic monument fashioned, like the well-known Egyptian Sphinx, by a forgotten people out of a pile of rock that lent itself to their design, perhaps as an emblem of warning and defiance to any enemies who approached the harbour. Unfortunately we were never able to ascertain whether or not this was the case, inasmuch as the rock was difficult of access both from the land and the waterside, and we had other things to attend to. Myself, considering the matter by the light of what we afterwards saw, I believe that it was fashioned by man, but whether or not this is so, there it stands, and sullenly stares from age to age out across the changing sea--there it stood two thousand years and more ago, when Amenartas, the Egyptian princess, and the wife of Leo's remote ancestor Kallikrates, gazed upon its devilish face--and there I have no doubt it will still stand when as many centuries as are numbered between her day and our own are added to the year that bore us to oblivion.|$|E

6000|$|I cannot express to {{you what}} entire {{enjoyment}} I find in this first visit to this prodigious metropolis of yours. Its wonders {{seem to me to}} be limitless. I go about as in a dream--as in a realm of enchantment--where many things are rare and beautiful, and all things are strange and marvellous. Hour after hour I stand--I stand spellbound, as it were--and gaze upon the statuary in Leicester Square. [Leicester Square being a horrible chaos, with the relic of an equestrian statue in the centre, the king being headless and limbless, and the horse in little better condition.] I visit the mortuary effigies of noble old Henry VIII., and Judge Jeffreys, and the preserved gorilla, and try to make up my mind which of my ancestors I admire the most. I go to that matchless Hyde Park and drive all around it, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>start</b> to enter it at the Marble Arch---and--am induced to [...] "change my mind." [...] [Cabs are not permitted in Hyde Park--nothing less aristocratic than a private carriage.] It is a great benefaction--is Hyde Park. There, in his hansom cab, the invalid can go--the poor, sad child of misfortune--and insert his nose between the railings, and breathe the pure, health--giving air of the country and of heaven. And if he is a swell invalid, who isn't obliged to depend upon parks for his country air, he can drive inside--if he owns his vehicle. I drive round and round Hyde Park, and the more I see of the edges of it the more grateful I am that the margin is extensive.|$|R
