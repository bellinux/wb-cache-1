25|$|Pethidine, {{also known}} as {{meperidine}} and sold under the brand name Demerol among others, is a synthetic opioid pain medication of the phenylpiperidine class. Synthesized in 1939 as a potential anticholinergic agent by the German chemist Otto Eisleb, its analgesic properties were first recognized by Otto Schaumann while working for IG Farben, Germany. Pethidine is the prototype of a large family of analgesics including the pethidine 4-phenylpiperidines (piminodine, anileridine and others), the prodines (<b>alphaprodine,</b> MPPP, etc.), bemidones (ketobemidone, etc.) and others more distant, including diphenoxylate and analogues.|$|E
5000|$|There are two isomers of the trans form of prodine, <b>alphaprodine</b> and betaprodine. Both exhibit optical {{isomerism}} and <b>alphaprodine</b> and betaprodine are racemates. [...] <b>Alphaprodine</b> {{was reported to}} closely related to desomorphine in steric configuration The cis form also has active isomers but not used in medicine [...] Betaprodine is some 5x more potent than <b>alphaprodine,</b> but is metabolised more rapidly, and only <b>alphaprodine</b> was developed for medicinal use. It has similar activity to pethidine, but with a faster onset of action and shorter duration. [...] Betaprodine produced more euphoria and side effects than <b>alphaprodine</b> at all dose levels and {{it was found that}} 5 to 10 mg of betaprodine equals 25 to 40 mg of <b>alphaprodine.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Alphaprodine</b> {{was sold}} under several brand names, mainly Nisentil and Prisilidine. It was mainly used for pain relief in {{childbirth}} and dentistry, {{as well as}} for minor surgical procedures. <b>Alphaprodine</b> has a duration of action of 1 to 2 hours and 40 to 60 mg is equal to 10 mg of morphine via the subcutaneous route.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alphaprodine</b> has a DEA ACSCN of 9010 and 2013 {{manufacturing}} {{quota of}} 3 grammes; betaprodine has an ACSCN of 9611 and a 2 gramme quota.|$|E
5000|$|Phenindamine does exhibit optical {{isomerism}} as do other chemicals of its general type ranging from pethidine and <b>alphaprodine</b> to cyproheptadine to certain herbacides and other industrial chemicals; the. [...] In the example at hand, the compound isophenidamine (60295-96-7 MSDS), which is inactive.|$|E
50|$|Piritramide was {{developed}} and patented in Belgium, at Janssen, in 1960. It {{is part of an}} eponymous two-member class of opioids in clinical use with the other being bezitramide (Burgodin). The closest chemical and structural relatives of piritramide in clinical use include the diphenoxylate family, fentanyl (both Janssen discoveries) and somewhat more distantly <b>alphaprodine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Prodine {{has similar}} effects to other opioids, and {{produces}} analgesia, sedation and euphoria. Side effects can include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression {{which can be}} life-threatening. Respiratory depression {{can be a problem}} with <b>alphaprodine</b> even at normal therapeutic doses. Unlike pethidine, prodine does not produce toxic metabolites and is therefore more suitable for high-dose therapy.|$|E
50|$|Diphenoxylate is the {{prototype}} of a small subfamily of opioids (the phenylpiperidines) including difenoxin (diphenoxylic acid), an active metabolite of diphenoxylate produced in the human body, and loperamide, which unlike the former two works exclusively in the intestines because it only crosses the blood-brain barrier in very small amounts. It was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1956. It is a congener to the narcotic pethidine. Other somewhat more distant relatives include <b>alphaprodine</b> and piritramide.|$|E
5000|$|Desmethylprodine {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1947 at Hoffman-LaRoche Laboratories by Albert Ziering and John Lee. They {{found that it}} produced effects similar to morphine when administered to rats. Ziering had been searching for synthetic painkillers that were less addictive than morphine. The new drug was a slight variant of pethidine. It {{was found to be}} no more effective than pethidine and was never marketed. [...] This research produced the analgesic <b>alphaprodine</b> (Nisentil, Prisilidine), a very closely related compound.|$|E
50|$|Alphacetylmethadol (INN), or α-acetylmethadol (AAM), is a {{synthetic}} opioid analgesic. Its levorotary enantiomer, levacetylmethadol, is an FDA-approved treatment for opioid addiction. Alphacetylmethadol {{is very similar}} in structure to methadone, a widely prescribed treatment for opioid addiction. In the United States, it is a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (presumably because it was never marketed in the US, {{as is the case}} with other common opiate/opioid medications such as diacetylmorphine and <b>alphaprodine),</b> with an ACSCN of 9603 and a 2013 annual manufacturing quota of 2 grammes.|$|E
5000|$|Tests in rats showed <b>alphaprodine</b> to be 97 {{per cent}} the {{strength}} of morphine via the subcutaneous route and 140 per cent {{the strength of}} methadone orally. [...] Betaprodine was 550 per cent as strong as morphine SC, and the laevorotary cis isomer was 350 per cent as strong, and the dextrorotary cis isomer was 790 per cent was strong. [...] Betaprodine by mouth was 420 per cent as strong as methadone, and the cis form was 390 per cent for the laevo and 505 per cent for the dextro isomers.|$|E
5000|$|Pethidine, {{also known}} as {{meperidine}} and Demerol, is a synthetic opioid pain medication of the phenylpiperidine class. Synthesized in 1939 as a potential anticholinergic agent by the German chemist Otto Eisleb, its analgesic properties were first recognized by Otto Schaumann while working for IG Farben, Germany. [...] Pethidine was the first wholly synthetic opioid developed and is the prototype of a large family of analgesics including the pethidine 4-phenylpiperidines (pethidine, piminodine, anileridine and others), the prodines (<b>alphaprodine,</b> MPPP, etc.), bemidones (ketobemidone, etc.) and others more distant, including diphenoxylate and analogues.|$|E
50|$|Piminodine (Alvodine) is an opioid {{analgesic}} {{that is an}} analogue of pethidine (meperidine). It was used in medicine briefly during the 1960s and 1970s, but has largely fallen out of clinical use. It was used particularly for obstetric analgesia and in dental procedures and, like pethidine, could be combined with hydroxyzine to intensify the effects. The duration of action is 2 to 4 hours and 7.5 to 10 mg via the subcutaneous route {{is the most common}} starting dose, being equal to 80 to 100 mg of pethidine, 40 to 60 mg of <b>alphaprodine</b> and 10 mg of morphine. Oral formulations were also available.|$|E
50|$|Phenadoxone (Heptalgin, Morphidone, Heptazone) is an opioid {{analgesic}} {{of the open}} chain class (methadone and relatives) invented in Germany by Hoechst in 1947. It {{is one of a}} handful of useful synthetic analgesics which were used in the United States for various lengths of time in the 20 or so years after the end of the Second World War but which were withdrawn from the market for various or no known reason and which now are mostly in Schedule I of the United States' Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or (like phenazocine and bezitramide) in Schedule II but not produced or marketed in the US. Others on this list are ketobemidone (Ketogin), dextromoramide (Dimorlin, Palfium and others), phenazocine (Narphen and Prinadol), dipipanone (Diconal, Pipadone and Wellconal), piminodine (Alvodine), propiram (Algeril), anileridine (Leritine) and <b>alphaprodine</b> (Nisentil).|$|E
40|$|The {{administration}} of <b>alphaprodine</b> submucosally in doses of 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5 mg/kg to ketaminized rhesus monkeys resulted in Po 2 levels {{significantly lower than}} those observed for controls (ketamine only) at the 10 min level. There was {{a significant increase in}} Po 2 levels between the 10 and 20 min intervals, thereafter, Po 2 levels returned toward normal and were not statistically different from baseline. Higher <b>alphaprodine</b> doses (1. 0 and 1. 5 mg/kg) resulted in a non-significant increase in Pco 2 values. Monitoring Po 2 levels during sedation seems preferable to monitoring Pco 2 in view of the findings of this study...|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to evaluate the}} effect of dihexyverine HCl (Metaspas), an anticholinergic and direct smooth muscle relaxant (spasmolytic), in shortening {{the first stage of}} labour. One hundred and five patients constituted the series: 31 were primiparae, 27 secundiparae and 47 multiparae. The majority of these (95) received one intramuscular injection (10 mg.) of dihexyverine. <b>Alphaprodine</b> (Nisentil), 40 mg., was administered in all but 10 cases, since dihexyverine has no analgesic action. Seventy-five control patients were used: 25 were primiparae, 25 secundiparae and 25 multiparae. <b>Alphaprodine</b> alone was administered to these control patients. The length of time for dilatation from 4 cm. to 10 cm. was the selected criterion. In the control group, the average time for complete cervical dilatation was 4 hours, 10 minutes. In the group treated by dihexyverine, complete dilatation was achieved in 1 hour, 16 minutes. On the average, the first stage of labour was 2 hours and 54 minutes shorter with dihexyverine; the clinical effect begins 10 - 30 minutes after administration. The only side effect encountered was a skin rash in one patient...|$|E
40|$|Conscious sedation, {{as used in}} {{dentistry}} {{and oral}} surgery, has been used satisfactorily to manage patients undergoing the intense pain encountered in radio frequency trigeminal rhizotomy for tic douloureux. The pain produced by this procedure cannot be blocked by local anesthesia. General anesthesia cannot be used {{because of the need}} for sensory testing in an awake, cooperative patient. Conscious sedation using <b>alphaprodine,</b> hydroxyzine, methohexital, and intensive behavioral modification was compared with a neuroleptic intravenous sedation technique using droperidol, fentanyl, and thiopental. Patients managed with conscious sedation were found to be more amnestic for the pain of surgery, a difference that persisted six months later...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of the hydrochloride DL-alphaprodine has been determined by the isomorphous replacement method {{with the aid of}} data for the hydrobromide. Zero-level normal, and first-level generalized, projections along the three axes have been employed. The structure has been refined by three-dimensional Fourier and differential syntheses. The stereochemical configuration found for the <b>alphaprodine</b> molecule agrees with that of one of four possible isomers and confirms that proposed by Beckett and co-workers on conformational and other grounds. The piperidine ring has the chair form with the phenyl ring equatorial and the propionoxy chain axial; the methyl group on C(3) is trans to the phenyl ring on C(4).

[...] First, a descriptive analysis was done on the pattern of initiation of breastfeeding in babies of unmedicated mothers. Then the hypothesis, that babies of mothers who received analgesia during labour would take longer to establish effective breastfeeding than babies of unmedicated mothers, was tested with oneway analysis of variance and Dunnett’s t-test. To rule out parity as a confounding variable, the analysis was repeated on the babies of multiparous mothers only in the <b>alphaprodine</b> (n = 20) and the non-medicated (n = 18) groups. [...] The results of the study showed that 66. 6 % of babies of mothers who received no analgesia during labour were breastfeeding effectively by 12. 5 hours after birth and that 85. 7 % had established breastfeeding by 24 hours. A statistical analysis of inter-group scores in both the mixed parity and the multiparous only groups, suggested that babies of mothers who received a standard dose of analgesic medication within one to four hours prior to delivery took significantly longer to establish effective breastfeeding than those whose mothers received no medication. There was no statistically significant difference when the mother received the medication within one hour prior to delivery. Babies of primiparous mothers took significantly longer than babies of multiparous mothers in all groups. A number of possible explanations are advanced for this result.
