40|$|The {{relationship}} between form drag and the zonal mean velocity in steady states is investigated {{in a very}} simple system, a barotropic quasi-geostrophic channel with a sinusoidal topography. When a steady solution is calculated by the modi ed Marquardt method keeping the zonal mean velocity constant as a control parameter, the characteristic of the solution changes at a velocity. The velocity coincides with a phase speed of a wave whose wavenumber is {{higher than that of}} the bottom topography. For smaller than this critical velocity, a stable quasi-linear solution which is similar to the linear solution exists. For larger than the critical velocity, three solutions whose form drag is very large exist which extend from the stable quasi-linear solution. It is inferred from the linear solution that these changes of the solution is due to the resonance of higher modes than that of the bottom topography. It is also found that the resonant velocity of the mode whose wavenumber {{is the same as the}} bottom topography has no e ect on these solutions. When the quiescent uid is accelerated by a constant wind stress, the <b>acceleration</b> <b>stops</b> around the critical velocity for wide range of the wind stress. If the wind stress is too large for the <b>acceleration</b> to <b>stop</b> there, the zonal current speed continues to increase in nitely.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we present a}} {{multilayer}} shallow model to approximate the Navier-Stokes equations with hydrostatic pressure and the μ(I) -rheology. The main advantages of this approximation are (i) the low cost associated with the numerical treatment of the free surface of the modelled flows, (ii) exact conservation of mass and (iii) the ability to compute 3 D profiles of the velocities in the directions along and normal to the slope. The derivation of the model follows [14] and introduces a dimensional analysis based on the shallow flow hypothesis. The proposed first order multilayer model fully satisfies a dissipative energy equation. A comparison with an analytical solution with a non-constant normal profile of the downslope velocity demonstrates {{the accuracy of the}} numerical model. Finally, by comparing the numerical results with experimental data, we show that the proposed multilayer model with the μ(I) -rheology reproduces qualitatively the effect of the erodible bed on granular flow dynamics and deposits, such as the increase of runout distance with increasing thickness of the erodible bed. We show that the use of a constant friction coefficient in the multilayer model leads to the opposite behaviour.

40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} said that, once a bomb casing has fractured, “detonation gases will then stream around the {{fragments}} or bypass them, and the <b>acceleration</b> process <b>stops</b> there. ” However, while apparently copious gas flow through casing fractures indicates some pressure release, {{it is also an}} indication of significant gas drive pressure, post casing fracture.

The second shows the modelling of a selected example in the CTH code. Both approaches reveal that gas escape, while occurring at its own sound-speed relative to the adjacent casing fragments, has to compete with rapid radial expansion of the casing.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the effect of skate blade radius of hollow (ROH) on anaerobic performance, specifically during the <b>acceleration</b> and <b>stopping</b> phases of an on-ice skating test. Fifteen, male Junior B hockey players (mean age 19 y ± 1. 46) were recruited to participate. On-icc testing required each participant to complete an on-ice anaerobic performance test [Reed Repeat Skate (RRS)) on three separate days. During each on-ice test, the participant's skate blades were sharpened to one of three, randomly assigned, ROH values (0. 63 cm, 1. 27 cm, 1. 90 cm). Performance times were recorded during each RRS and used to calculate anaerobic variables [anaerobic power (W), anaerobic capacity (W), and fatigue index (s, %)). Each RRS was video recorded for the purpose of motion analysis. Video footage was imported into Peak Motus™ to measure kinematic variables of the <b>acceleration</b> and <b>stopping</b> phases. The specific variables calculated from the acceleration phase were: average velocity over 6 m (m/s), average stride length (m), and mean stride rate (strides/s). The specific variables calculated from the stopping phase were: velocity at initiation of stopping (rn/s), stopping distance (m), stopping time (s). A repeated measures ANOV A was used to assess differences in mean performance and kinematic variables across the three selected hollows. Further analysis was conducted to assess differences in trial by trial performance and kinematic variables for all hollows. The primary findings of the study suggested that skate blade ROH can have a significant effect on kinematic variables, namely stride length and stride rate during the <b>acceleration</b> phase and <b>stopping</b> distance and stopping time during the stopping phase of an on-ice anaerobic performance test. During the acceleration phase, no significant difdifferences were found in SR and SL across the three selected hollows. Mean SR on the 1. 27 cm hollow was significantly slower than both the 0. 63 cm and 1. 90 cm hollows and SL was significantly longer when skating on the 1. 27 cm hollow in comparison to the 1. 90 cm hollow. During the stopping phase, stopping distance on the 0. 63 cm hollow (4. 12 m ± 0. 14) was significantly shorter than both the 1. 27 cm hollow (4. 43 m ± 0. 08) (p < 0. 05) and the 1. 90 cm ho]) ow (4. 35 m ± 0. 12) (p < 0. 05). Mean ST was also significantly shorter when stopping on the 0. 63 cm hollow then both the 1. 27 cm and 1. 90 cm hollows. Trial by trial results clearly illustrated the affect of fatigue on kinematic variables; AV, SR, IV decreased from trial 1 to 6.

In the following report, a scalable, phone-based, driving data collection system is developed and applied to powertrain design through a motivating example. Initial project efforts are directed towards the development of both a data collection platform and a system which is capable of interpreting and storing the collected drive data. The developed UWAFT Innovation Platform (UIP) and Monocular Vision Pipeline (MVP) are a functional system which attempt to precipitate crowdsourcing of data collection through a low system cost and open software approach. In an application of this platform data is collected by a test driver for a month {{in the form of a}} pilot project, with results evaluated in terms of geographical coverage and with the development of a statistical event profile detailing events of simulation value. The data collected contains over 6 million data points, and over 7. 45 hrs of driving. In evaluating MVP performance, the You Only Look Once (YOLO) multi-object detector and Markov Decision Process (MDP) multi-object tracker are implemented, with results demonstrating robustness to occlusions and the capability to detect far-away pedestrians and vehicles. With this data collection system functional, and the data from the pilot project experiment, a powertrain simulation environment for University of Waterloo Alternative Fuels Team (UWAFT) is developed. Given the Advanced Vehicle Technology Competition (AVTC) process, it is crucial to continue to explore and design novel powertrain configurations in an environment which is conducive to flexible configuration and with acceptable ease-of-use. Of the environments available, Simscape is selected and a novel Metal-Air Extended Range Electric Vehicle (MA-EREV) powertrain model is developed as a validation of the simulation tool. Upon validating simulated VTS against existing work, results are consistent excluding a 15 % reduction in estimated range and a 41 % decrease in 50 - 70 mph acceleration time. To provide an example of the data-driven approach, a winter-driving scenario where the pilot project driver demonstrated slipping is imported as a drive cycle in the MA-EREV model and simulated in an experiment. In analyzing results traction performance of the MA-EREV is evaluated. The MA-EREV weighs 677 kg more than the pilot project vehicle, and has increased starting torque due to electrification. In analyzing the results of this scenario replication, the longitudinal slip on the tires reached a maximum of 41 % slip (94 % of available traction) during stopping and 84 % slip (55 % of available traction) during <b>acceleration</b> from <b>stop,</b> with more slipping overall during <b>acceleration</b> than <b>stopping.</b> This result indicates that the MA-EREV may need additional traction considerations for safe performance in winter conditions...|$|R
