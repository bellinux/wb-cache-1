25|$|Fixed {{stations}} are generally powered from the <b>AC</b> <b>mains</b> electrical supply {{available in the}} building. Some equipment in fixed stations may run off low voltage DC instead of AC, and require a separate power supply.

5000|$|Different {{radio set}} models were {{required}} for <b>AC,</b> DC <b>mains,</b> and battery operation. For example a 1933 Murphy radio with {{essentially the same}} circuit had different models for AC supply, DC supply, and battery operation. The introduction of AC/DC circuitry allowed a single model to be used on either <b>AC</b> or DC <b>mains</b> as a selling point, and some such models added [...] "Universal" [...] to their name (such sets usually had user-settable voltage tapping arrangements to cater for {{the wide range of}} voltages).|$|R

25|$|A typical {{switched-mode}} {{power supply}} first converts the <b>AC</b> <b>mains</b> to a DC bus {{by means of a}} bridge rectifier or a similar circuit. The output voltage is then derived from this DC bus. The problem with this is that the rectifier is a non-linear device, so the input current is highly non-linear. That means that the input current has energy at harmonics of the frequency of the voltage.|$|E
25|$|As a cost {{reduction}} measure, especially in high-volume consumer receivers, all the tube heaters could be connected in series across the AC supply using heaters requiring the same current {{and with a}} similar warm-up time. In one such design, a tap on the tube heater string supplied the 6 volts needed for the dial light. By deriving the high voltage from a half-wave rectifier directly connected to the <b>AC</b> <b>mains,</b> the heavy and costly power transformer was eliminated. This also allowed such receivers to operate on direct current, a so-called AC/DC receiver design. Many different US consumer AM radio manufacturers of the era used a virtually identical circuit, given the nickname All American Five.|$|E
25|$|Regulators powered from AC power {{circuits}} can use silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs) as {{the series}} device. Whenever the output voltage {{is below the}} desired value, the SCR is triggered, allowing electricity to flow into the load until the <b>AC</b> <b>mains</b> voltage passes through zero (ending the half cycle). SCR regulators have the advantages of being both very efficient and very simple, but {{because they can not}} terminate an ongoing half cycle of conduction, they are not capable of very accurate voltage regulation in response to rapidly changing loads. An alternative is the SCR shunt regulator which uses the regulator output as a trigger, both series and shunt designs are noisy, but powerful, as the device has a low on resistance.|$|E
25|$|A switch selects the Trigger Source. It {{can be an}} {{external}} input, one of the vertical channels of a dual or multiple-trace oscilloscope, or the <b>AC</b> line (<b>mains)</b> frequency. Another switch enables or disables Auto trigger mode, or selects single sweep, if provided in the oscilloscope. Either a spring-return switch position or a pushbutton arms single sweeps.|$|R
50|$|An {{uninterruptible}} {{power supply}} (UPS) uses batteries and an inverter to supply <b>AC</b> power when <b>mains</b> power is not available. When mains power is restored, a rectifier supplies DC power to recharge the batteries.|$|R
5000|$|This FCC {{assigned}} {{call sign}} {{had been previously}} assigned to the college radio station at South Dakota State University, in Brookings, South Dakota. Originally, it had a standard AM transmitter that covered the local area, but due to some incidents, the station was reduced to operate through common-carrier transmitters in the dormitories, which used the <b>AC</b> power <b>mains</b> in the buildings for distribution. The [...] "AGY" [...] part of the call-sign {{was due to the}} school being an agriculturally based, land-grant college, thus, KAGY.|$|R
25|$|Unlike the {{standard}} BS1363 plugs {{found in the}} UK, the earth pin is on a horizontal axis and the line and neutral pins on a vertical axis. This style of plug/socket was used by university laboratories (from batteries) and the BBC, and is still in use on parts of the London Underground for 110 V AC voltage supply. In the 1960s they were used for 240 V DC in the Power laboratory of the Electrical Engineering department of what was then University College, Cardiff. Power was supplied by the public 240 V DC mains which remained available {{in addition to the}} 240 V <b>AC</b> <b>mains</b> until circa 1969, and thereafter from in-house rectifiers. They were also used in the Ministry of Defence Main Building on circuits powered from the standby generators to stop staff from plugging in unauthorised devices, e.g. kettles. They were also known to be used in some British Rail offices for the same reason.|$|E
500|$|Other key pedals used by grunge bands {{included}} four {{brands of}} distortion pedals (the Big Muff, DOD and BOSS DS-2 and BOSS DS-1 distortion pedals) and the Small Clone chorus effect, used by Kurt Cobain on [...] "Come As You Are" [...] {{and by the}} Screaming Trees on [...] "Nearly Lost You". The RAT distortion pedal {{played a key role}} in Cobain’s switching from quiet to loud and back to quiet approach to songwriting. The use of small pedals by grunge guitarists helped to start off the revival of interest in boutique, hand-soldered, 1970s-style analog pedals. The other effect that grunge guitarists used was one of the most low-tech effects devices, the wah-wah pedal; it is one of the rare pedals that requires no external battery or <b>AC</b> <b>mains</b> power and it uses very simple circuitry. Both [...] " [...] Thayil and Alice in Chains’ Jerry Cantrell...were great advocates of the wah wah pedal." [...] Wah was also used by the Screaming Trees, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Dinosaur Jr.|$|E
2500|$|However C {{batteries}} {{continued to}} be included in some equipment even when the [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] batteries had been replaced by power from the <b>AC</b> <b>mains.</b> That was possible because there was essentially no current draw on these batteries; they could thus last for many years (often longer than all the tubes) without requiring replacement.|$|E
50|$|A {{power supply}} unit (or PSU) {{converts}} <b>mains</b> <b>AC</b> to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a computer.

The 845MW Shepherds Flat Wind Farm in Oregon is the first windpark in the United States to utilize this model as its primary wind turbine. Unlike GE's 1.5MW models, the 2.5XL uses a permanent magnet generator, and its entire output is converted to <b>AC</b> at <b>mains</b> frequency.

50|$|The {{power supply}} unit (PSU) {{converts}} general-purpose <b>mains</b> <b>AC</b> electricity to direct current (DC) for the other components of the computer. The rated output capacity of a PSU should usually be about 40% greater than the calculated system power consumption needs obtained by adding up all the system components. This protects against overloading the supply, and guards against performance degradation.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two basic}} {{differences}} between AT and ATX power supplies: the connectors that provide power to the motherboard, and the soft switch. In ATX-style systems, the front-panel power switch provides only a control signal to the power supply and does not switch the <b>mains</b> <b>AC</b> voltage. This low-voltage control allows other hardware or software to turn the system on and off.|$|R
2500|$|For {{applications}} with frequencies {{higher than}} the domestic <b>AC</b> <b>mains</b> supply (e.g. 50Hz or 60Hz), thyristors with lower values of tQ are required. Such fast thyristors {{can be made by}} diffusing heavy metal ions such as gold or platinum which act as charge combination centers into the silicon. Today, fast thyristors are more usually made by electron or proton irradiation of the silicon, or by ion implantation. [...] Irradiation is more versatile than heavy metal doping because it permits the dosage to be adjusted in fine steps, even at quite a late stage in the processing of the silicon.|$|E
2500|$|In {{inductive}} coupling (electromagnetic induction or inductive power transfer, IPT), power is transferred between coils of wire by a magnetic field. [...] The {{transmitter and receiver}} coils together form a transformer (see diagram). An alternating current (AC) through the transmitter coil (L1) creates an oscillating magnetic field (B) by Ampere's law. [...] The magnetic field [...] passes through the receiving coil (L2), where it induces an alternating EMF (voltage) by Faraday's law of induction, which creates an alternating current in the receiver. [...] The induced alternating current may either drive the load directly, or be rectified to direct current (DC) by a rectifier in the receiver, which drives the load. [...] A few systems, such as electric toothbrush charging stands, work at [...] 50/60Hz so <b>AC</b> <b>mains</b> current is applied directly to the transmitter coil, but in most systems an electronic oscillator generates a higher frequency AC current which drives the coil, because transmission efficiency improves with frequency.|$|E
50|$|There is 5 {{millisecond}} (ms) hold-up {{capability for}} uninterrupted {{operation of the}} Rectiverter. Shorter interruptions (< 5ms) of <b>AC</b> <b>mains</b> will not affect {{the operation of the}} Rectiverter. The AC output will not be affected, nor the DC output. Longer <b>AC</b> <b>mains</b> interruptions will cause the Rectiverter to go into inverter mode of operation. If <b>AC</b> <b>mains</b> returns within a few line cycles, the reconnection is done within seconds, due to the synchronization is still in place.|$|E
5000|$|DC/AC {{converters}} (inverters) {{are used}} primarily in UPS or renewable energy systems or emergency lighting systems. Mains power charges the DC battery. If the mains fails, an inverter produces <b>AC</b> electricity at <b>mains</b> voltage from the DC battery. Solar inverter, both smaller string and larger central inverters, {{as well as}} solar micro-inverter are used in photovoltaics {{as a component of}} a PV system.|$|R
5000|$|The {{power supply}} {{circuits}} in electronic equipment that produce direct current (DC) {{needed by the}} device from the alternating current (<b>AC)</b> supplied by <b>mains</b> use filter capacitors to smooth the DC current. A large electric charge can remain in these capacitors after the unit is turned off, constituting a shock hazard. For example switching mode power supplies use a bridge rectifier to convert <b>mains</b> <b>AC</b> power into DC at 320 V (for 220 V mains) or 160 V (for 115 V. mains), before the voltage is reduced by the chopper. These incorporate one or more filter capacitors to smooth the pulsing output voltage from the rectifier. These must typically store enough energy at this high voltage to power the load during the zero crossings of the AC input. In addition, the capacitors in many supplies are made large enough to supply the load during AC outages lasting for a significant fraction of a second. This stored charge is often enough to deliver a lethal shock. The capacitors in high voltage DC power supplies used in devices such as lasers, x-ray machines, radio transmitters and old style CRT computer monitors and televisions can have higher, more dangerous voltages.|$|R
