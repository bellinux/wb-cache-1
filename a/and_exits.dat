40|$|Entry <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> {{are crucial}} {{elements}} of market selection process {{which leads to}} the restructuring, adaptation and evolution of an industry. While the importance of entry <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> has been recognised, attention has focused almost exclusively on quantifying barriers to them, rather than on investigating the determinants of entry <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> <b>and</b> measuring the magnitude of these processes. This paper analyses the entry <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> dynamics of Turkish manufacturing industry defined at the 4 -digit ISIC level for the period 1981 - 1997. While, on the one hand, inflation targeting focuses on the determinants of entry <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> <b>and</b> their sectoral variation, on the other hand, inflation targeting verifies the link between entry <b>and</b> <b>exit.</b> This paper employs a dynamic panel data estimation procedure to investigate the relationship between entry <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> <b>and</b> to estimate the models of entry <b>and</b> <b>exit.</b> Our empirical findings suggest that rates of entry <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> are determined by profit margin, growth rate of output, concentration ratio, labor productivity, average wage rate, advertisement intensity, capital intensity and wage and productivity differentials as explanatory variables.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of five individual essays and an introductory chapter. The essays {{are all in}} the field of industrial dynamics and more specifically focus on firm entry <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> in Swedish industrial sectors. The essays mainly contribute to the empirical literature on entry <b>and</b> <b>exit.</b> In four of the five essays, panel data methods are used in the empirical investigation. The first essay presents the patterns of entry <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> in industrial sectors in Sweden and studies the importance of different determinants of entry <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> rates in industries. The second essay focuses on the relationship between entry <b>and</b> <b>exit.</b> The third essay has a regional perspective, focusing on regional determinants of entry <b>and</b> <b>exit.</b> It also investigates the importance of the differences in industry structure for differences in entry <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> rates across regions. The fourth chapter uses the theory of product life cycle to investigate how knowledge intensity differs in entering <b>and</b> <b>exiting</b> firms in different stages of the product life cycle. The fifth and last essay focuses on the importance of firm demography, in terms of firm size and age, for the decision to perform process R&D, product R&D or combine process with product R&D...|$|R

40|$|The {{interdependence}} between entry <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> {{of firms}} into manufacturing industries {{is the focus}} of this research. When both entry <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> equations are estimated separately the results support the existence of strong symmetry in their determinants. When, however, entry <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> are estimated within a simultaneous equation framework, the empirical evidence does not offer sufficient grounds to support the notion that entry <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> are simultaneously linked. Instead it seems that they are two contemporaneously related processes which respond in like fashion to the structural characteristics found in particular industries. Their linked response is also extended to factors unaccounted for by the individual entry <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> formulations, <b>and</b> this expresses itself in significant contemporaneous correlation between the entry <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> equation residuals. The change in the identities of firms operating, implied by the positive correlation between entry <b>and</b> <b>exit,</b> may then be attributed to industry turbulent conditions, which in turn appear perhaps to be conditioned in the shorter run by time-invariant inter-industry differences in technological factors and sunk costs. ...|$|R

This paper uses Chilean data {{to analyze the}} determinants of entry <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> in <b>and</b> out of export markets. We find that entry <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> rates differ across industries; vary over time; and are positively correlated. The econometric analysis shows that within-industry heterogeneity, measured by differences in productivity or other firm characteristics, has {{a significant effect on}} plant turnover in international markets. Our findings reveal that trade costs, factor intensities, and fluctuations in the real exchange rate play a minor role explaining entry <b>and</b> <b>exit.</b> This last result is consistent with hysteresis in international markets.

40|$|While {{the entry}} <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> of firms is an {{important}} component of many economic models, measures {{of the importance of the}} associated firm turnover have been lacking. Using a specially constructed data base from the Canadian Census of Manufactures that allows firms and establishments to be followed over time. this paper presents basic data on the importance of entry <b>and</b> <b>exit.</b> It discuss the conceptual, theoretical, and empirical issues involved in measuring entry <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> <b>and</b> in building a longitudinal data set for this purpose. It then presents measures of entry <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> in the 1970 s and 1980 s. In doing so, it focuses both on the size of entrants at birth and also on their cumulative effect. It describes the transition path on entrants as they move from a stage of infancy to early adolescence. This is done by presenting the exit rates of births, their length of life and the growth path of entrants. In each case, the paper takes care to measure two different types of entry <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> <b>and</b> to compare the performance of each. In particular, entry by acquisition <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> by divestiture are compared to entry by plant opening <b>and</b> <b>exit</b> by plant closing. The paper shows that while entrants are small at birth, the cumulative effect of successive cohorts of new firms adds up to a significant fraction of all firms and of total sales by the end of a decade. ...|$|R
