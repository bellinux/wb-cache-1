Life in the arctic regions is like one of Turner's pictures, in which the lights are strong, the shadows deep, and the tout ensemble hazy and romantic. So cold and prolonged is the winter, that the first mild breath of spring breaks on the senses like a zephyr from the plains of paradise. Everything bursts suddenly into vigorous life, after the long death-like sleep of Nature, as little children burst into the romping gaieties of a new day after the deep repose of a long and tranquil night. The snow melts, the ice breaks up, and rushes in broken masses, heaving and tossing in the rising flood, that grind and whirl them into the ocean, or into those great fresh-water lakes that vie with ocean itself in magnitude and grandeur. The buds come out and the leaves appear, clothing all nature with a bright, refreshing green, which derives additional brilliancy from sundry patches of snow that fill the deep creeks and hollows everywhere, and form ephemeral fountains whose waters continue to supply a thousand rills for many a long day, until the fierce glare of the summer sun prevails at last and melts them all away.|$|E

The float altitude was between 14 and 2 hPa (29 – 42 km), depending on the flights. Aerosol enhancements were detected for altitude levels above 40 hPa, with a stronger variability above 20 hPa. Two {{of them could be}} attributed to the fortuitous detection of meteoric debris. Thin layers of strong local enhancements of submicronic aerosols were detected during the other flights. Using simultaneous in situ measurements of the N 2 O tracers by the infra‐red SPIRALE balloon‐borne spectrometer, it can be concluded that the occurrence of these enhancements is not directly linked to the variability of air mass origins.

5000|$|Global warming {{proceeds}} {{because of}} {{changes to the}} composition of gases in the Earth's atmosphere and Oceans by the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. As warming proceeds, it brings about changes to the natural environment which may result in other changes. For example, warming may begin to melt the Greenland ice sheet and/or West Antarctic Ice Sheet. At some level of temperature rise, the melt of the entire ice sheet will become inevitable; but the ice sheet itself may persist for millennia [...] A tipping point may be passed without any immediately obvious consequences, nor any acceleration of the warming process. Carbon dioxide [...] makes up 396.18 ppm of Earth's atmosphere and monitoring stations in the <b>Arctic</b> <b>spring</b> 2012 measuring more than 400 ppm of the heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere. [...] James E. Hansen said that this tipping point had already been reached in April 2008 when the [...] level was 385 ppm. (Hansen states 350 ppm as the upper limit.) [...] "Further global warming of 1°C defines a critical threshold. Beyond that we will likely see changes that make Earth a different planet than the one we know."

40|$|Arctic amplification, the {{accelerated}} climate warming in the polar regions, is causing a more rapid {{advancement of the}} onset of spring in the Arctic than in temperate regions. Consequently, the arrival of many migratory birds in the Arctic is thought to become increasingly mismatched {{with the onset of}} local spring, consequently reducing individual fitness and potentially even population levels. We used a dynamic state variable model to study whether Arctic long-distance migrants can advance their migratory schedules under climate warming scenarios which include Arctic amplification, and whether such an advancement is constrained by fuel accumulation or the ability to anticipate climatic changes. Our model predicts that barnacle geese Branta leucopsis suffer from considerably reduced reproductive success with increasing Arctic amplification through mistimed arrival, when they cannot anticipate a more rapid progress of <b>Arctic</b> <b>spring</b> from their wintering grounds. When geese are able to anticipate a more rapid progress of <b>Arctic</b> <b>spring,</b> they are predicted to advance their spring arrival under Arctic amplification up to 44 days without any reproductive costs in terms of optimal condition or timing of breeding. Negative effects of mistimed arrival on reproduction are predicted to be somewhat mitigated by increasing summer length under warming in the Arctic, as late arriving geese can still breed successfully. We conclude that adaptation to Arctic amplification may rather be constrained by the (un) predictability of changes in the <b>Arctic</b> <b>spring</b> than by the time available for fuel accumulation. Social migrants like geese tend to have a high behavioural plasticity regarding stopover site choice and migration schedule, giving them the potential to adapt to future climate changes on their flyway...|$|E
40|$|Emission of bromine from sea-salt aerosol, frost flowers, ice leads, {{and snow}} {{results in the}} nearly {{complete}} removal of surface ozone during <b>Arctic</b> <b>spring.</b> Regions of enhanced total column BrO observed by satellites have traditionally been associated with these emissions. However, airborne measurements of BrO and O 3 within the convective boundary layer (CBL) during the ARCTAS and ARCPAC field campaigns at times bear little relation to enhanced column BrO. We show that the locations of numerous satellite BrO “hotspots” during <b>Arctic</b> <b>spring</b> are consistent with observations of total column ozone and tropopause height, suggesting a stratospheric origin to these regions of elevated BrO. Tropospheric enhancements of BrO large enough to affect the column abundance are also observed, with important contributions originating from above the CBL. Closure of the budget for total column BrO, albeit with significant uncertainty, is achieved by summing observed tropospheric partial columns with calculated stratospheric partial columns provided that natural, short-lived biogenic bromocarbons supply between 5 and 10 ppt of bromine to the Arctic lowermost stratosphere.

In particular, the tropospheric eddy heat flux in middle to late winter (January [...] February) is highly correlated with the mean polar stratospheric temperature during March. Strong midwinter planetary wave forcing leads to a warmer <b>spring</b> <b>Arctic</b> lower stratosphere in early spring, while weak midwinter forcing leads to cooler <b>spring</b> <b>Arctic</b> temperatures.

The ARCTEX- 2006 campaign site was located about 200 m southeast of the settlement on flat snow covered tundra, 11 m to 14 m above sea level. The permanent sites used for this study consisted of the 10 m meteorological tower of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar- and Marine Research (AWI), the international standardized radiation measurement site of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN), the radiosonde launch site and the AWI tethered balloon launch sites. The temporary sites - set up by the University of Bayreuth - were a 6 m meteorological gradient tower, an eddy-flux measurement complex (EF), and a laser-scintillometer section (SLS). A quality assessment and data correction was applied to detect and eliminate specific measurement errors common at a high arctic landscape. In addition, the quality checked sensible heat flux measurements are compared with bulk aerodynamic formulas that are widely used in atmosphere-ocean/land-ice models for polar regions as described in Ebert and Curry (1993, doi: 10. 1029 / 93 JC 00656) and Launiainen and Cheng (1995). These parameterization approaches easily allow estimation of the turbulent surface fluxes from routine meteorological measurements.
