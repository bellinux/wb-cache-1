The appeal was denied four months later. The contempt of court fines were appealed again on January 9, 1989, and affirmed again on March 29. Following the convictions in the Alexandria court, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charges from the Boston court, canceling the retrial. The LaRouche lawyers appealed that decision on March 13, 1989, arguing that they needed the trial to exonerate LaRouche.|$|E

50|$|On appeal it {{was argued}} that the case of U.S. v. Lara-Hernandez, was {{distinguishable}} from the Hanoum case since in Lara, the motion for <b>new</b> <b>trial</b> had been based upon facts known to the accused {{at the time of}} the trial. However, in Hanoum, the facts upon which the motion for <b>new</b> <b>trial</b> was based had not been known to the defendant in the seven-day period after trial. The Court of Appeals added <b>a</b> <b>new</b> aspect to the standard and held that <b>a</b> motion for <b>new</b> <b>trial</b> based upon “newly discovered evidence” is limited only to where the newly discovered evidence relates to the elements of the crime charged. The Hanoum case is significant in that it established <b>a</b> <b>new</b> interpretation of the law with regard to <b>a</b> motion for <b>new</b> <b>trial</b> based upon newly discovered evidence. The Supreme Court denied the Writ of Certiorari in this case.|$|R

Additionally, in his autobiography, Kunstler alleged that he later learned from a law enforcement agent that a New Jersey State Assembly member had addressed the jury at the hotel where they were sequestered, urging them to convict Shakur.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> {{motion for}} <b>new</b> <b>trial</b> asks to {{overturn}} or {{set aside a}} court's decision or jury verdict.

This motion must be based on some vital error in the court's handling of the trial, such as the admission or exclusion of key evidence, or an incorrect instruction to the jury. Generally the motion is filed within a short time after the trial (7-30 days) and is decided prior to the lodging of an appeal.

5|$|The Court of Appeals {{held that}} Blacksmith could {{independently}} bring the claim for trespass, {{for which he}} need only show a right to possession.

The Court of Appeals remanded back to the Supreme Court, after which a writ of error was granted by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E

Jackalow was not retried and was released.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>trial</b> is {{scheduled}} for March 2014, in which Apple will seek to prevent Samsung from selling some of its current devices in the U.S. The case will involve further debate over monetary compensation. In the 2014 lawsuit, Samsung is accused of infringing five of Apple Inc.'s patents in 10 phone and tablet models, while Samsung has responded with a counterclaim, in which it states that two patents for nine phones and tablets have been infringed on by Apple. Jury selection for the trial occurred on March 31, 2014. Samsung stands to gain $6 million if the jury rules in its favor, while Apple is seeking $2 billion in damages and could proceed with similar lawsuits against other Android handset makers, as the relevant patent issues extend beyond Samsung's software technology.|$|E
