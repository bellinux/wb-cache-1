500|$|In a February 4, 2008 {{appearance}} on the G4 television program Attack of the Show!, Mark Ebner, journalist {{and author of the}} book Hollywood, Interrupted, and Nick Douglas of Gawker.com commented on Project Chanology. Ebner stated that [...] "Hacking their site is not really the best way to go about taking them (the Church of Scientology) down. Most critics you talk to want the Scientology site to be up there so that people who are interested can see the stupidity they have on the web and at the same time they can go - they are a few keystrokes from getting <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>other</b> opinions." [...] Nick Douglas explained that the group decided to shift their strategy away from the attacks to Scientology websites: [...] "Anonymous even decided that they were going to stop that attack, that it was a bad idea. It's the usual thing they used to do when they really hadn't had a thought out plan, and here they're realizing they actually have to figure out some real plan against a real enemy." ...|$|E

The Los Angeles Times Carina Chocano felt that [...] "despite flashes of genuine emotion [...] {{eventually}} succumbs {{to its own}} tweeness" [...] and that the [...] "moments of beauty" [...] were outweighed by [...] "the mannered dialogue and hamstrung performances". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly graded the film as a C, saying that it [...] "travels, but it doesn't go anywhere" [...] and likening Pucci to [...] "a wan, passive Johnny Depp". The Hollywood Reporter critic Frank Scheck praised the film's [...] "appealing performances, sun-dappled cinematography and occasional witty dialogue", but {{thought that it was}} [...] "contrived and derivative" [...] and [...] "a little too pleased with itself". The Globe and Mails Rick Groen called The Go-Getter [...] "a fairly well-made picture that's just been fairly well-made too many times before, a knock-off of <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>other</b> knock-offs". Gabriel Wilder of The Sydney Morning Herald felt that it was [...] "hard to maintain interest in [...] plight" [...] because of Pucci's underacting and thought that [...] "the script isn't so much quirky as incomplete", referring to the film's ending. With a rating of 2.5 out of 4, Maitland McDonagh wrote for TV Guide that the film is [...] "too familiar to make any great impression".|$|E

It is known that in both the Parthian Empire and Kushan Empire of Asia, ethnic Greeks continued to be employed after the Hellenistic period as musicians and athletes. The Book of the Later Han states that Emperor An transferred these entertainers from his countryside residence to the capital Luoyang, where they gave a performance at his court and were rewarded with gold, silver, and other gifts. Raoul McLaughlin notes that the Romans knew Burma as India Trans Gangem (India Beyond the Ganges) and that Ptolemy listed the cities of Burma. McLaughlin speculates that the Romans were selling slaves to the Burmese and that this is how the entertainers originally reached Burma before they were sent by the Burmese ruler to Emperor An in China. Syrian jugglers were renowned in Western Classical literature, and Chinese sources from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD mention them as well.|$|E
