40|$|The paper gives a {{comprehensive}} overview {{on the project}} “Varieties of Austrian German- Standard pronunciation and varieties of standard pronunciation ” whose primary goal {{is the creation of}} a pronouncing dictionary of Austrian German {{and the creation of a}} large data base of audio samples for research on spoken language and different forms of pronunciation in Austria. The contents of the dictionary and the database are described in detail. The project is based on the idea that German is a pluricentric language which means that German and Swiss model speaker realisations will be also included in the database alongside with the Austrian model speakers. A corpus of 86. 000 words spoken by 6 model speakers and a large number of texts will be published together with the dictionary on CD-ROM in 2003. The paper also gives an overview on the theoretical and methodological foundations of the project which is supported by the <b>Austrian</b> national <b>broadcasting</b> <b>corporation</b> and funded by the Austrian national bank. Finally the database and the user-interface is described in detail which allows a number of different queries and will have a built-in tool for the acoustic analysis of sound files chosen by the user. 1...|$|R
40|$|The paper gives a {{comprehensive}} overview over the results, the concepts {{and the methods}} which were developed and used to create the Pronouncing Dictionary of Austrian German (ÖAWB/AGPD) and the Austrian Pronouncing Database ADABA. The AGPD contains 42. 000 entries {{which are based on}} a large audio corpus of 75. 964 realisations of two model speakers each from Austria, Germany and Switzerland. The ADABA database provides 9 different ways to search the data. It also contains 24 model texts and another 30 texts showing linguistic and phonetic variation in Austria and in the other German speaking countries. The codification of Austrian standard pronunciation was based on the concept of German as a pluricentric language and on the concept of "media presentation language". Austrian pronunciation forms are presented in parallel with those of Germany and Switzerland to allow the comparison of differences between linguistically close national varieties of a language. The paper also gives a detailed characterisation of the software (tran-scriber, database) which was developed during the project that was supported by the <b>Austrian</b> national <b>broadcasting</b> <b>corporation</b> ORF and the University for Music and Dramatic Arts in Graz. Some of the software and the data can be obtained from the web site www. adaba. at. 1...|$|R
