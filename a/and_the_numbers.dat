5|$|The sejm {{comprised}} two chambers, {{with varying}} numbers of deputies. After the 1569 Union of Lublin, the Kingdom of Poland {{was transformed into}} the federation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of sejm participants were significantly increased with {{the inclusion of the}} deputies from Lithuanian sejmiks. The deputies had no set term of office, although in practice it was about four months long, from their election at a regional sejmik, to their report on the next sejmik dedicated to hearing and discussing the previous sejm's proceedings (those sejmiks were known as relational or debriefing). Deputies had parliamentary immunity and any crimes against them were classified as lèse-majesté.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the evening, key {{warships}} {{that remained}} in government hands included Bahias sister , the aging cruiser , and the eight new destroyers of the Pará class. Their potential power, however, was dwarfed by the dreadnoughts—each of which outgunned all of the warships alone—and was severely tempered by personnel issues. First, naval officers were suspicious of even the enlisted men who remained loyal to the government. Officers took over all of the positions that would be involved in direct combat, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of enlisted men were reduced wherever possible. Further complicating matters were missing weapon components, such as the destroyer's torpedoes, which could not be fired without firing caps, yet the caps were not where they were supposed to be. When caps were finally located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes carried by the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only two days after the rebellion began.|$|E
5|$|Industrialisation, {{urbanisation}} and the Disruption of 1843 all {{undermined the}} tradition of parish schools. From 1830 the state began to fund buildings with grants; then from 1846 it was funding schools by direct sponsorship; and in 1872 Scotland moved to a system like that in England of state-sponsored largely free schools, run by local school boards. The historic University of Glasgow became a leader in British higher education by providing {{the educational needs of}} youth from the urban and commercial classes, as opposed to the upper class. The University of St Andrews pioneered the admission of women to Scottish universities. From 1892 Scottish universities could admit and graduate women <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of women at Scottish universities steadily increased until the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The poorer {{people were}} also {{alarmed by the}} {{contagion}} and some left the city, {{but it was not}} easy for them to abandon their accommodation and livelihoods for an uncertain future elsewhere. Before exiting through the city gates, they were required to possess a certificate of good health signed by the Lord Mayor and these became increasingly difficult to obtain. As time went by <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of plague victims rose, people living in the villages outside London began to resent this exodus and were no longer prepared to accept townsfolk from London, with or without a certificate. The refugees were turned back, were not allowed to pass through towns and had to travel across country, and were forced to live rough on what they could steal or scavenge from the fields. Many died in wretched circumstances of starvation and thirst in the hot summer that was to follow.|$|E
5|$|The {{total number}} of blue {{wildebeest}} {{is estimated to be}} around 1,550,000. The population trend overall is stable <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> in the Serengeti National Park (Tanzania) have increased to about 1,300,000. The population density ranges from 0.15/km2 in Hwange and Etosha National Parks to 35/km2 in Ngorongoro Crater and Serengeti National Park where they are most plentiful. Blue wildebeest have also been introduced into a number of private game farms, reserves and conservancy areas. For these reasons, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) rates the blue wildebeest as being of Least Concern. However, the numbers of the eastern white-bearded wildebeest (C. t. albojubatus) have seen a steep decline in numbers to a current level of probably 6,000 to 8,000 animals and this is causing some concern.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the modern}} period the {{situation}} of indigenous languages has grown increasingly precarious in Mexico, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of speakers of virtually all indigenous languages have dwindled. Although the absolute number of Nahuatl speakers has actually risen over the past century, indigenous populations have become increasingly marginalized in Mexican society. In 1895, Nahuatl was spoken by over 5% of the population. By 2000, this proportion had fallen to 1.49%. Given the process of marginalization combined with the trend of migration to urban areas and to the United States, some linguists are warning of impending language death. At present Nahuatl is mostly spoken in rural areas by an impoverished class of indigenous subsistence agriculturists. According to the Mexican national statistics institute, INEGI, 51% of Nahuatl speakers {{are involved in the}} farming sector and 6 in 10 receive no wages or less than the minimum wage.|$|E

The next section presents a low-overhead method to estimate the level of sub-block parallelism <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of decoding iterations, which can be efficiently used at run-time.|$|R

40|$|We propose an {{algorithm}} {{for reducing}} the hardware complexity of linear phase FIR digital filters without resorting {{to an increase in}} <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of adder steps in the multiplier block adders. We aggressively reduce both <b>the</b> coefficient wordlength <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of non-zero bits in the filter coefficients so that the adder step can be minimized. The hardware implementation of the coefficients is such that <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of full adders is proportional to the product of the input signal wordlength <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of adders. That is, in general, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of full adders is independent of <b>the</b> coefficient wordlength <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of shifts between nonzero bits in the coefficient. Results show that the proposed technique achieves a 67 % and 71 % reduction in <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of multiplier block adders <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of multiplier block full adders respectively. Our technique has been successfully applied to filters with up to 500 taps...|$|R
