5|$|Arachnophobia is a {{specific}} phobia—it is the <b>abnormal</b> <b>fear</b> of spiders or anything reminiscent of spiders, such as webs or spider-like shapes. It {{is one of the}} most common specific phobias, and some statistics show that 50% of women and 10% of men show symptoms. It may be an exaggerated form of an instinctive response that helped early humans to survive, or a cultural phenomenon that is most common in predominantly European societies.|$|E
5|$|While {{the venom}} {{of a few}} species is {{dangerous}} to humans, scientists are now researching the use of spider venom in medicine and as non-polluting pesticides. Spider silk provides a combination of lightness, strength and elasticity that is superior to that of synthetic materials, and spider silk genes have been inserted into mammals and plants to see if these {{can be used as}} silk factories. As a result of their wide range of behaviors, spiders have become common symbols in art and mythology symbolizing various combinations of patience, cruelty and creative powers. An <b>abnormal</b> <b>fear</b> of spiders is called arachnophobia.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of the Dog's actions, Heine is apathetic and distant from almost all other people. Also, due to the previously-depicted event, and the twisted form of love Einstürzen lavished on him (while calling herself his [...] "mother"), Heine {{developed}} gynophobia, an <b>abnormal</b> <b>fear</b> of women, and usually suffers a mental breakdown when in close proximity to a woman. Heine, however, develops a close bond with Nill after discovering she is also a genetic experiment and that he can come into physical contact with her. Heine is often Badou's [...] "work partner".|$|E
50|$|The MMPI {{subscale}} 7 describes psychasthenia as akin to obsessive-compulsive disorder, and as characterised by excessive doubts, compulsions, obsessions, and unreasonable fears. The psychasthenic has {{an inability}} to resist specific actions or thoughts, regardless of their maladaptive nature. In addition to obsessive-compulsive features, the scale taps <b>abnormal</b> <b>fears,</b> self-criticism, difficulties in concentration, and guilt feelings. The scale assesses long-term (trait) anxiety, although it is somewhat responsive to situational stress as well.|$|R

6000|$|Duane knew, for he {{had seen}} them pay. Best of all, moreover, he knew the {{internal}} life of the gun-fighter of that select {{but by no means}} small class of which he was representative. The world that judged him and his kind judged him as a machine, a killing-machine, with only mind enough to hunt, to meet, to slay another man. It had taken three endless years for Duane to understand his own father. Duane knew beyond all doubt that the gun-fighters like Bland, like Alloway, like Sellers, men who were evil and had no remorse, no spiritual accusing Nemesis, had something far more torturing to mind, more haunting, more murderous of rest and sleep and peace; and that something was <b>abnormal</b> <b>fear</b> of death. Duane knew this, {{for he had}} shot these men; he had seen the quick, dark shadow in eyes, the presentiment that the will could not control, and then the horrible certainty. These men must have been in agony at every meeting with a possible or certain foe--more agony than the hot rend of a bullet. They were haunted, too, haunted by this fear, by every victim calling from the grave that nothing was so inevitable as death, which lurked behind every corner, hid in every shadow, lay deep in the dark tube of every gun. These men could not have a friend; they could not love or trust a woman. They knew their one chance of holding on to life lay in their own distrust, watchfulness, dexterity, and that hope, by the very nature of their lives, could not be lasting. They had doomed themselves. What, then, could possibly have dwelt in the depths of their minds as they went to their beds on a starry night like this, with mystery in silence and shadow, with time passing surely, and the dark future and its secret approaching every hour--what, then, but hell? ...|$|E

The term comes from the ἄλγος, álgos, [...] "pain" [...] and , phóbos, [...] "fear".|$|R
5000|$|Photophobia is {{a symptom}} of {{abnormal}} intolerance to visual perception of light. As a medical symptom, photophobia is not a morbid fear or phobia, but an experience of discomfort or pain to the eyes due to light exposure or by presence of actual physical sensitivity of the eyes, though the term is sometimes additionally applied to <b>abnormal</b> or irrational <b>fear</b> of light such as heliophobia. The term photophobia comes from the Greek φῶς (phōs), meaning [...] "light", and φόβος (phobos), meaning [...] "fear". Photophobia is a common symptom of visual snow.|$|R
40|$|Trait {{anxiety is}} a {{well-established}} {{risk factor for}} developing anxiety disorders, but evidence for <b>abnormal</b> associative <b>fear</b> learning in high trait anxious (HTA) individuals is inconclusive. In part, this may due to limitations in the scope and measures used to assess fear learning. The current study therefore assessed fear learning across multiple response domains and multiple test phases in a two-day discriminative fear-conditioning paradigm. We tested whether trait anxiety is associated with deficient safety learning, by comparing HTA individuals (N = 20) and healthy Controls (N = 22). HTA participants showed stronger fear on the startle response and distress ratings to the safety (CS−) {{but not to the}} threat stimulus (CS+) during acquisition, along with impaired extinction and re-extinction. Trait anxiety did not affect skin conductance responses and effects on UCS-expectancy were limited. We conclude that high trait anxiety may be characterized by deficient safety learning which in turn may promote persistent and generalized fear responses...|$|R

5000|$|Ergophobia or ergasiophobia is an <b>abnormal</b> and {{persistent}} <b>fear</b> of [...] (manual labor, non-manual labour, etc.) or finding employment. Ergophobia {{may also be}} a subset of either social phobia or performance anxiety. Sufferers of ergophobia experience undue anxiety about the workplace environment even though they realize their fear is irrational. Their fear may actually be a combination of fears, such as fear of failing at assigned tasks, speaking before groups at work (both of which are types of performance anxiety), socializing with co-workers (a type of social phobia), and other fears of emotional, psychological and/or physiological injuries.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe neural {{mechanisms}} by which fear is inhibited are poorly understood at the present time. Behaviorally, a conditioned fear response may be reduced in intensity {{through a number of}} means. Among the simplest of these is extinction, a form of learning characterized by a decrease in the amplitude and frequency of a conditioned response when the conditioned stimulus that elicits it is repeatedly nonreinforced. Because clinical interventions for patients suffering from fear dysregulation seek to inhibit <b>abnormal,</b> presumably learned <b>fear</b> responses, an understanding of fear extinction is likely to inform and increase the efficacy of these forms of treatment. This review considers the behavioral, cellular, and molecular literatures on extinction and presents the most recent advances in our understanding while identifying issues that require considerable further research...|$|R
5000|$|Death {{anxiety is}} the central concern of DAH. It is the morbid, <b>abnormal</b> or {{persistent}} <b>fear</b> of one's own death or the process of his/her dying. One definition of death anxiety is a [...] "feeling of dread, apprehension or solicitude (anxiety) when one thinks {{of the process of}} dying, or ceasing to ‘be’". It is also referred to as thanatophobia (fear of death), and is distinguished from necrophobia, which is a specific fear of dead or dying persons and/or things (i.e. others who are dead or dying, not one's own death or dying). DAH proposes that no one is free from this anxiety unless there is something significantly positive in the phenomenon of death for humans. Hossain claimed, the idea of 'cessation of existence' through death is the prime factor responsible for initiating death anxiety in one.|$|R
50|$|Mysophobia, {{also known}} as verminophobia, germophobia, germaphobia, bacillophobia and bacteriophobia, is a {{pathological}} fear of contamination and germs. The term was coined by Dr. William Alexander Hammond in 1879 when describing a case of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) exhibited in repeatedly washing one's hands. Mysophobia has long been related to the OCD of constantly washing one's hands. Names pertaining directly to the <b>abnormal</b> <b>fear</b> of dirt and filth include molysmophobia or molysomophobia, rhypophobia, and rupophobia, whereas the terms bacillophobia and bacteriophobia specifically refer to the fear of bacteria and microbes in general.|$|E

5000|$|Ablutophobia (from Latin ablutere 'to wash off") is the persistent, <b>abnormal</b> and unwarranted <b>fear</b> of bathing, washing, or cleaning. This phobia is a {{situational}} specific phobia. Ablutophobia {{tends to}} be more common in children and females than in males. However, the fear generally dissipates in children as they learn that bathing is not something to be feared. Ablutophobia is more common in European nations as well as people of European descendants in other countries, it is because bathing was not a common practice {{for a long time in}} most part of Europe until modern age. Scientists say that in 16th century, almost all people of English, French and other European countries had symptoms of ablutophobia. Elizabeth the first of England is known as one of the most [...] "clean" [...] person of Europe from that period of time, for washing her body once a month. However, back then that was considered to be too much of washing and unhealthy. A research shows that the symptoms of ablutophobia led to a major contribution of the development of fragrance.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper and {{presentation}} is for fun, enjoyment and education. Also, this should prove helpful to people who deal with any level of aerophobia – the <b>abnormal</b> and persistent <b>fear</b> of flying. This activity will add greater detail to all who travel on airliners. As the five senses of our body feed information to our mind about the activities and events that take place in commercial air travel, each person processes this information differently. For a knowledgeable or unconcerned air traveler such activities and events add little or no stress. However, to someone who knows little about the activities and events of air travel each bump, noise, unusual smell, pressure change, light flicker, other aircraft movement seen out the window, mechanical noise, public address announcements, aircraft attitude changes, runway/taxi or gate delays, et cetera, all of this adds stress and concern. Sometimes stress and concern becomes irrational and cause fear and panic to people in this people-filled environment not sympathetic to outbreaks of fear or panic attacks. Most people are able to control their composure, but continue to internally deal wit...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{significance}} of behavioral neuroscience and {{the validity of}} its animal models of human pathology largely depend on the possibility to replicate a given finding across different laboratories. Under the present test and housing conditions, this axiom fails to resist the challenge of experimental validation. When several mouse strains are tested on highly standardized behavioral test batteries in different laboratories, significant strain 6 lab interactions are often detected. This limitation, predominantly due to elevated within-group variability observed in control subjects, increases the number of animals needed to address fine experimental questions. Laboratory rodents display <b>abnormal</b> stress and <b>fear</b> reactions to experimental testing, which might depend on {{the discrepancy between the}} stability of the neonatal environment and the challenging nature of the adult test and housing conditions. Methodology/Principal Findings. Stimulating neonatal environments (e. g. brief maternal separations, increased foraging demands or maternal corticosterone supplementation) reduce stress and fear responses in adulthood. Here we tested whether reduced fearfulness associated with experimental testing would also reduce inter-individual variation. In line with our predictions, we show that a moderate elevation in neonatal corticosterone through maternal milk significantly reduces fear responses and inter-individual variability (average 44 %) in adult mouse offspring. Conclusions/Significance. We observed reduced variation in pain perception, novelty preference, hormonal stress response and resistance to pathogen infection. This suggests that {{the results of this study}} may apply to a relatively broad spectrum of neuro-behavioral domains. Present findings encourage a reconsideration of the basi...|$|R
