5|$|The Hockey Sweater is Carrier's {{most famous}} work and is {{considered}} an iconic piece of Canadian literature. The story has sold over 300,000 copies and has been republished in numerous anthologies. It exemplifies the nation's passion for hockey, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> often considered an allegory of the relationship and tensions that exist between francophones and anglophones, the story is popular throughout the entire nation. A line from the story appears on Canadian five-dollar bills printed between 2001 and 2013.|$|E
5|$|Charles Dickens is {{reputed to}} have set his novel Hard Times in the city, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> partly {{modelled}} on Preston, {{it shows the}} influence of his friend Mrs Gaskell. Gaskell penned all her novels, {{with the exception of}} Mary Barton, at her residence on Plymouth Grove. On numerous occasions Gaskell's house played host to influential authors including Dickens, Charlotte Brontë, Harriet Beecher Stowe and Charles Eliot Norton. It is now open as a literary museum. Also closely associated with the city is Victorian poet and novelist Isabella Banks, most famed for her 1876 novel The Manchester Man. Anglo-American author Frances Hodgson Burnett was born in the city's Cheetham Hill district in 1849, and wrote much of her classic children's novel The Secret Garden while visiting nearby Salford's Buile Hill Park.|$|E
5|$|Dio {{maintains}} that one purpose for Caracalla issuing the edict was {{the desire to}} increase state revenue; at the time, Rome was in a difficult financial situation and needed {{to pay for the}} new pay raises and benefits that were being conferred on the military. The edict widened the obligation for public service and gave increased revenue through the inheritance and emancipation taxes that only had to be paid by Roman citizens. The provincials also benefited from this edict because they were now able {{to think of themselves as}} equal partners to the Romans in the empire. However, few of those that gained citizenship were wealthy, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> true that Rome was in a difficult financial situation, it is thought that this could not have been the sole purpose of the edict.|$|E

25|$|Nitrox is {{a popular}} diving gas mix, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not used for deep diving, it reduces the buildup of {{nitrogen}} in the diver's tissues by increasing the percentage of oxygen in the breathing gas {{as a substitute for}} part of the nitrogen. The depth limit of a nitrox mixture is governed by the partial pressure of oxygen, which is generally limited to 1.4 to 1.6 bar depending on the activity of the diver and duration of exposure.|$|E
25|$|A periscope rifle is a rifle {{that has}} been adapted to enable it to be sighted {{by the use of}} a periscope. This enables the shooter to remain {{concealed}} below cover. The device was independently invented by a number of individuals in response to the trench warfare conditions of the First World War, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not clear which army was the first to use periscope rifles, the weapons were in use by the end of 1914. Similar devices were also built for use with machine guns.|$|E

25|$|According to Dr Robbie McDonald, Head of Wildlife and Emerging Diseases at FERA (the lead {{wildlife}} {{scientist for}} Defra and responsible {{for research on}} badgers) the benefit of culling a population is outweighed by the detrimental effect on neighbouring populations of badgers. He is reported as saying that {{a huge number of}} badgers would have to be killed to make a difference <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> cheap and easy to exterminate animals {{in the early days of}} a cull it gets harder and more expensive as time goes on.|$|E
25|$|Stroopwafels {{are thin}} waffles with a syrup filling. The stiff batter for the waffles {{is made from}} flour, butter, brown sugar, yeast, milk, and eggs. Medium-sized balls of batter are put on the waffle iron. When the waffle is baked <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> still warm, it is cut into two halves. The warm filling, made from syrup is spread in between the waffle halves, which glues them together. They are popular in the Netherlands and Belgium and sold in pre-prepared {{packages}} in shops and markets.|$|E

25|$|As {{soon as the}} {{disturbances}} had ceased, the Jews {{began to}} return and to rebuild their destroyed homes; <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> true that the Jewish population of Poland had decreased, it still was more numerous {{than that of the}} Jewish colonies in Western Europe. Poland continued to be the spiritual center of Judaism. Through 1698, the Polish kings generally remained supportive of the Jews. It also should be noted that while Jewish losses in those events were high, estimated by some historians to be close to 500,000, the Commonwealth lost one third of its population — approximately three million of its citizens.|$|E
25|$|The biographical {{material}} {{is to be}} found in chapters 26–29, 32, and 34–44, and focuses on the events leading up to and surrounding the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians in 587; it provides precise dates for the prophet's activities beginning in 609 BCE. The non-biographical prose passages, such as the Temple sermon in chapter 7 and the covenant passage in 11:1–17, are scattered throughout the book; they show clear affinities with the Deuteronomists, the school of writers and editors who shaped the series of history books from Judges to Kings, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> unlikely they come directly from Jeremiah, they may well have their roots in traditions about what he said and did.|$|E
25|$|From Copenhagen, {{the plague}} had {{infected}} several places in Holstein, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> unclear whether Danish ships first {{brought it to}} Friedrichsort, Rendsburg or Laboe, and whether Schleswig and Flensburg were infected separately, it is established {{that it was the}} Danish army that brought the plague to Holstein. In addition to the ports, infected towns included Itzehoe, Altona, Kropp and Glückstadt, in Kiel, the plague was limited to the castle and spared the town. The plague also broke out in neighboring Bremen-Verden, whose capital, Stade, became infected by early July 1712 and on 7 September capitulated to the Danish forces who had entered Bremen-Verden on 31 July. The plague, as in formerly Swedish Livonia and Estonia, was a main reason for the defendants' surrender.|$|E

25|$|Dactylopius coccus is {{native to}} {{tropical}} and subtropical South America and Mexico, where their host cacti grow natively. They have been widely introduced to many regions where their host cacti also grow. About 200 species of Opuntia cacti are known, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible to cultivate cochineal on almost all of them, the most common is Opuntia ficus-indica. D. coccus has only been noted on Opuntia species, including O. amyclaea, O. atropes, O. cantabrigiensis, O. brasilienis, O. ficus-indica, O. fuliginosa, O. jaliscana, O. leucotricha, O. lindheimeri, O. microdasys, O. megacantha, O. pilifera, O. robusta, O. sarca, O. schikendantzii, O. stricta, O. streptacantha, and O. tomentosa. Feeding cochineals can damage and kill the plant. Other cochineal species feed {{on many of the}} same Opuntia, and the wide range of hosts reported for D. coccus likely is because of the difficulty in distinguishing it from other Dactylopius species.|$|E
25|$|There {{has always}} been a close and affectionate tie between the Notre Dame Band {{and the rest of the}} Notre Dame community. Rev. Edward Sorin, C.S.C., who founded the {{university}} in 1842, is strongly rumored to have been a clarinet player. <b>And</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible that the Notre Dame Band and musical studies originated with the university that same year, the earliest reference to the band is in 1846 when it played at the first graduation ceremony. The importance of music on campus also caused a Music Hall/Auditorium to be built as the third major building of the new school after the classroom/dormitory building (The Golden Dome) and the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Indiana. The legendary football coach, Knute Rockne, played flute for Notre Dame, and former Athletic Director Edward Moose Krause spent some years studying music before putting his clarinet on the shelf and devoting himself to athletics.|$|E
500|$|Despite Parker's bleak {{assessment}} <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> true {{that some}} members of the Round Table are perhaps now [...] "famous for being famous" [...] instead of for their literary output, Round Table members and associates contributed to the literary landscape, including Pulitzer Prize-winning work by Circle members Kaufman, Connelly and Sherwood (who won four) and by associate Ferber and the legacy of Ross's New Yorker. Others made lasting contributions to the realms of stage and screen — Tallulah Bankhead and Eva Le Gallienne became Broadway greats and the films of Harpo and Benchley remain popular; and Parker has remained renowned for her short stories and literary reviews.|$|E

Series writer Gail Simone stated that while the character is [...] "one of the smartest and toughest women in comics...

500|$|Several critics {{commented on}} the {{controversy}} over lines in the film talking about the mentally disabled. Duane Dudek of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel wrote that the film [...] "...is just sophomoric enough to offend. <b>And</b> <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also funny, it is without the empathy or compassion to cause us to wonder why we are laughing." [...] Christian Toto of The Washington Times argued against the opposition, [...] "Tropic Thunder is drawing fire from special interest groups for ...its frequent {{use of the word}} 'retard', but discerning audiences will know where the humor is targeted. And they'll be laughing too hard to take offense." [...] Kurt Loder of MTV contrasted the opposition to the lines with Downey character portrayal of an African American, [...] "The scene in which the derisive Alpa Chino [...] nails Lazarus' recitation of black-uplift homilies as nothing more than the lyrics to the Jeffersons theme is funny; but the one in which Lazarus quietly explains to Speedman that his Simple Jack character failed because he made the mistake of going 'full retard'—rather than softening his character with cuteness in the manner of Forrest Gump—is so on-the-nose accurate, it takes your breath away." ...|$|E
