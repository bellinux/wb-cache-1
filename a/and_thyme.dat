5|$|The Good Huswifes Jewell is an English cookery book by the cookery and {{housekeeping}} writer Thomas Dawson, {{first published}} in 1585. It includes recipes for medicines as well as food. To the spices found in Medieval English cooking, the book adds herbs, especially parsley <b>and</b> <b>thyme.</b> Sugar is used {{in many of the}} dishes, along with now-unfamiliar ingredients like violets and rosewater.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Grayson {{constructed}} Grayson's Tavern in Danville {{sometime around}} 1785. The asymmetrical, ell-shaped building faces south onto Walnut Street with a front entrance {{on the south}} and a side entrance on the west, which opens onto Constitution Square. The Mary Akin Memorial Herb Garden, located behind Grayson's Tavern, features a variety of herbs that were commonly cultivated in the area during the late 18th and early 19th century, including chives, fennel, honeysuckle, lavender, rosemary, sage, <b>and</b> <b>thyme.</b> The garden is maintained by the Garden Club of Danville and named for one of its long-time members.|$|E
5|$|Bookends is {{the fourth}} studio album by American music duo Simon & Garfunkel. Produced by Paul Simon, Roy Halee and Art Garfunkel, the album was {{released}} on April 3, 1968 in the United States by Columbia Records. The duo had risen to fame two years prior with the albums Sounds of Silence and Parsley, Sage, Rosemary <b>and</b> <b>Thyme</b> and the soundtrack album for the 1967 film The Graduate.|$|E
50|$|The {{grassland}} species include sheep's fescue, quaking {{grass and}} glaucous sedge. Herbs include rock-rose, restharrow, Carline thistle, common milkwort and dwarf thistle, yellow-wort, fairy flax, wild <b>thyme</b> <b>and</b> large <b>thyme</b> (Thymus pulegioides). <b>Thyme</b> <b>and</b> common knapweed are plentiful, which is usual {{for this kind}} of grassland.|$|R

25|$|In {{the manner}} of Greek wine, Roman wine was often flavored with herbs and spices (similar to modern vermouth and mulled wine) and was {{sometimes}} stored in resin-coated containers, giving it a flavor similar to modern retsina. Romans were {{particularly interested in the}} aroma of wine and experimented with various methods of enhancing a wine's bouquet. One technique that gained some usage in southern Gaul was planting herbs such as lavender <b>and</b> <b>thyme</b> in the vineyards, believing that their flavors would pass through the ground and into the grapes. Modern-day wines from the Rhone are often characterized by using the aroma descriptors of lavender <b>and</b> <b>thyme,</b> presumably as a reflection of the grape varieties used and the terroir. Another widespread practice was the storage of amphoras in a smoke chamber called a fumarium to add smokiness to a wine's flavor.|$|E
25|$|Wine expert Karen MacNeil {{notes that}} most well made {{examples}} of Provençal wine have flavors and aromas {{that reflect the}} garrigue landscape of the region which includes wild lavender, rosemary <b>and</b> <b>thyme.</b> The rosés of the region are normally dry with zestiness derived from their acidity. The red and whites are characterized by their full bodies and intense aromatics. The nature and impression of the wines change significantly depending on whether they are consumed as an apéritif or paired with food, particularly the traditional flavors of Provençal cuisine. The rosé wine in particular is noted {{for its ability to}} pair well with garlic based dishes, such as aioli.|$|E
50|$|A Waterford variant {{involves}} dicing {{the onion}} quite small <b>and</b> excluding the <b>thyme</b> <b>and</b> salt, instead opting for generous amounts of white pepper.|$|R

50|$|The {{garden was}} created in 1983 {{on the banks of}} the river Eygues, and now {{contains}} about 200 types of aromatic and medicinal plants, including cedar, Cercis siliquastrum, chestnut, cypress, juniper, olive trees, pine, <b>and</b> rosemary, <b>thyme,</b> <b>and</b> viburnum.|$|R
25|$|Food {{was also}} flavored by plants, most {{native to the}} region and either {{cultivated}} or gathered in the wild, although a few spices were imported. Garlic and onions, and possibly fenugreek, were used to season cooked foods, {{as well as being}} eaten as vegetables. Herbs and spices included capers, coriander, cumin and black cumin, dill, dwarf chicory, hyssop, marjoram, mint, black mustard, reichardia, saffron <b>and</b> <b>thyme.</b> Some seasonings were imported, such as myrrh, galbanum, saffron and cinnamon, but their high cost limited their widespread use. Spices for special feasts were imported by the wealthy and royalty from Arabia and India, and were highly valued. These included various types of pepper, and ginger.|$|E
25|$|Central Otago {{with the}} second highest area planted, has strong, sweet plum and cherry {{flavours}} <b>and</b> <b>thyme</b> notes. In wines from cooler sub-regions there are edgier qualities with fresh herb, spice and pronounced mineral flavours. Wairarapa produces wines that are lighter, softer and more supple. Waipara in Canterbury has two styles. Wines produced on the flat valley floor are lighter and supple and have a bias toward red fruits. Pinot produced on the surrounding hills appear more concentrated, with dark fruit flavours and occasionally with a chalk/mineral influence. Nelson is similarly divided into two sub-regions with the Waimea plains producing accessible wines with vibrant acidity and those from the Moutere Valley producing wine that is richer, more concentrated and structured.|$|E
25|$|As a varietal wine, Merlot {{can make}} soft, velvety wines with plum flavors. While Merlot wines tend to mature faster than Cabernet Sauvignon, some {{examples}} {{can continue to}} develop in the bottle for decades. There are three main styles of Merlot — a soft, fruity, smooth wine with very little tannins, a fruity wine with more tannic structure and, finally, a brawny, highly tannic style made in the profile of Cabernet Sauvignon. Some of the fruit notes commonly associated with Merlot include cassis, black and red cherries, blackberry, blueberry, boysenberry, mulberry, ollalieberry and plum. Vegetable and earthy notes include black and green olives, cola nut, bell pepper, fennel, humus, leather, mushrooms, rhubarb and tobacco. Floral and herbal notes commonly associated with Merlot include green and black tea, eucalyptus, laurel, mint, oregano, pine, rosemary, sage, sarsaparilla <b>and</b> <b>thyme.</b> When Merlot has spent significant time in oak, the wine may show notes of caramel, chocolate, coconut, coffee bean, dill weed, mocha, molasses, smoke, vanilla and walnut.|$|E

Bookends (1968), their next album, topped the Billboard 200 chart and included the number-one single [...] "Mrs. Robinson" [...] from the film.|$|E
500|$|A more {{familiar}} {{version of the}} dish was described in an 1879 cookbook by Marion Cabell Tyree. [...] Her Housekeeping in Old Virginia described [...] "Gumbo Filit A La Creole", a filé-based gumbo with chicken and oysters and spiced with allspice, cloves, red and black pepper, parsley, <b>and</b> <b>thyme.</b> [...] The 1881 cookbook What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking, dictated by former slave Abby Fisher, contained three gumbo recipes. [...] "Oyster Gumbo Soup" [...] used a filé base, while [...] "Ochra Gumbo" [...] and [...] "Chicken Gumbo" [...] used okra as a base. Four years later, the cookbook La Cuisine Creole documented eight varieties of gumbo. [...] None used sausage, but {{almost all of them}} contained ham.|$|E

500|$|Simon & Garfunkel first burst {{onto the}} {{national}} scene when their hit single [...] "The Sound of Silence" [...] made waves on radio in 1965, during {{a period in which}} the duo had broken up due to the failure of their debut release, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M. (1964). Following another release, Sounds of Silence (1965), the duo recorded and released Parsley, Sage, Rosemary <b>and</b> <b>Thyme</b> (1966), which brought new critical and commercial success to the duo. Simon, then 25, felt he had finally [...] "made it" [...] into an upper echelon of rock and roll, while most importantly retaining artistic integrity ("making him spiritually closer to Bob Dylan than to, say, Bobby Darin", wrote biographer Marc Eliot). The duo chose William Morris as their booking agency after a recommendation from Wally Amos, a mutual friend through their producer, Tom Wilson.|$|E
500|$|Simon & Garfunkel's third album, Parsley, Sage, Rosemary <b>and</b> <b>Thyme,</b> was {{released}} on October 10, 1966, and produced five singles. It peaked at number four in the US and number thirteen in the UK, and received a three-time multi-platinum certification by RIAA. The single [...] "Mrs. Robinson" [...] {{was included in the}} band's first and only soundtrack, The Graduate, and was later included on their fourth studio album Bookends, which {{was released}} on April 3, 1968. It peaked at number one in both the US and UK, therefore becoming their first number one album, and received two-times multi-platinum in the US. On January 26, 1970, they released their fifth and final studio album, Bridge over Troubled Water. It was their most successful to date, peaking at number one in several countries, including the UK and US. The album sold over twenty-five million copies worldwide, and received eight-time multi-platinum in the US.|$|E
500|$|As they {{considered}} their previous effort a [...] "rush job" [...] {{to capitalize on}} their sudden success, the duo spent more time crafting the follow-up. It {{was the first time}} Simon insisted on total control in aspects of recording. Work began in 1966 and took nine months. [...] Garfunkel considered the recording of [...] "Scarborough Fair" [...] to be the point at which they stepped into the role of producer, as they were constantly beside engineer Roy Halee mixing the track. Parsley, Sage, Rosemary <b>and</b> <b>Thyme</b> was issued in October 1966, following the release of several singles and receiving sold-out college campus shows. The duo resumed their trek on the college circuit eleven days following the release, crafting an image that was described as [...] "alienated", [...] "weird", and [...] "poetic". Manager Mort Lewis also was responsible for this public perception, as he withheld them from television appearances (unless they were allowed to play an uninterrupted set or choose the setlist). Simon, then 26, felt he had finally [...] "made it" [...] into an upper echelon of rock and roll, while most importantly retaining artistic integrity ("making him spiritually closer to Bob Dylan than to, say, Bobby Darin", wrote biographer Marc Eliot). The duo chose William Morris as their booking agency after a recommendation from Wally Amos, a mutual friend through their producer Tom Wilson.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the anti-inflammatory {{effects of the}} combination of <b>thyme</b> <b>and</b> oregano essential oil dietary administered at three concentrations (0. 4 % <b>thyme</b> <b>and</b> 0. 2 % oregano oils; 0. 2 % <b>thyme</b> <b>and</b> 0. 1 % oregano oils; 0. 1 % <b>thyme</b> <b>and</b> 0. 05 % oregano oils) on mice with TNBS-induced colitis. Treatment of colitic animals with the essential oils decreased the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 1 ÃŽÂ², IL- 6, GM-CSF, and TNFÃŽÂ±, especially after application of the medium dose. The medium dose of the essential oils significantly lowered the amount of IL- 1 ÃŽÂ² and IL- 6 proteins too. Moreover, administration of the medium dose decreased the mortality rate, accelerated the body weight gain recovery, and reduced the macroscopic damage of the colonic tissue. Our results indicate that combined treatment with appropriate concentrations of <b>thyme</b> <b>and</b> oregano essential oils can reduce the production of proinflammatory cytokines, and thereby attenuate TNBS-induced colitis in mice...|$|R
