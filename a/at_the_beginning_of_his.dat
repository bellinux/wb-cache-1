5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career, comedian Spede Pasanen asked Vainio and {{his friends}} {{to play in a}} radio show called Ruljanssiriihi ("Thrashing House of Rigmarole"). The band accepted, and after Pasanen gave up the radio show to start his {{television}} career, the musicians followed him. They played in Pasanen's shows including Speden saluuna ("Spede's Saloon") and 50 pientä minuuttia ("50 Small Minutes").|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{reign as}} boss, Massino enjoyed {{the benefit of}} limited FBI attention. In 1987, with the Bonannos weakened, the FBI merged its Bonanno squad with its Colombo family squad, and this squad was {{initially}} preoccupied with the Colombos' third internal war. Another dedicated Bonanno squad would be established in 1996.|$|E

From 1926 he started to sign himself as Sri Aurobindo, Sri (meaning holy in Sanskrit) being commonly used as an honorific.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the many}} factors in his success was Como's insistence on his {{principles}} of good taste; if he considered something to be in bad or questionable taste, {{it was not in}} the show or broadcast. When a remark made by Julius La Rosa about television personality Arthur Godfrey on The Perry Como Show was misconstrued, Como offered an on-air apology <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> next show, against the advice of his staff.|$|E

5|$|As {{a sophomore}} at Georgia Southern in 1990, Hamilton had an 18–4 record with a 3.07 ERA. He was one of nine finalists for the Golden Spikes Award, and he earned Second Team All-American honors from The Sporting News and Baseball America. However, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> junior season he went 13 with a 7.43 ERA after {{starting}} five games. It was soon discovered that Hamilton was suffering from an elbow injury, which forced him to have surgery in 1992.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> rule, the {{government}} was divided between two PDPA factions: the Khalqists (which Taraki was the leader of), the majority, and the Parchamites, the minority. In 1978, shortly after his rule began, Taraki started a purge of {{the government}} and party which led to several high-ranking Parchamite members being sent into de facto exile by being assigned to serve overseas as ambassadors. His reign was marked by a cult of personality centered on himself that had been cultivated by Amin. His relationship with Amin turned sour during his rule, ultimately resulting in Taraki's overthrow on 14 September 1979 and subsequent murder on 8 or 9 October, upon Amin's orders.|$|E

5|$|It is {{wonderful}} {{that both of}} these things occurred under Valerian; {{and it is the}} more remarkable in this case when we consider his previous conduct, for he had been mild and friendly toward the men of God, for none of the emperors before him had treated them so kindly and favorably; and not even those who were said openly to be Christians received them with such manifest hospitality and friendliness as he did <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> reign. For his entire house was filled with pious persons and was a church of God.|$|E
5|$|Louis sent small expeditions {{one after}} one to Italy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> war against Joanna, {{because he did}} not want to harass the Italians who had {{suffered}} from a famine the previous year. His first troops departed under the command of Nicholas Vásári, Bishop of Nyitra (now Nitra in Slovakia), on 24 April 1347. Louis also hired German mercenaries. He departed from Visegrád on 11 November. After marching through Udine, Verona, Modena, Bologna, Urbino, and Perugia, he entered the Kingdom of Naples on 24 December near L'Aquila, which had yielded to him.|$|E
5|$|Ray's regular {{film editor}} was Dulal Datta, but the {{director}} usually dictated the editing while Datta did the actual work. Because of financial reasons and Ray's meticulous planning, his films were mostly cut in-camera (apart from Pather Panchali). <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career, Ray worked with Indian classical musicians, including Ravi Shankar, Vilayat Khan, and Ali Akbar Khan. He {{found that their}} first loyalty was to musical traditions, and not to his film. He had {{a greater understanding of}} Western classical forms, which he wanted to use for his films set in an urban milieu. Starting with Teen Kanya, Ray began to compose his own scores.|$|E

5|$|Veltmann {{scored a}} victory <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> defense: he moved and was granted that each officer's {{testimony}} {{could only be}} applied to the men they had specifically named as having been given the order to work. In principle, this ruling was favorable, but in practice it would only benefit the men if the court had been attentively keeping notes for each accused man. Instead, reporters observed the court to be drowsy at times, with one particular judge regularly nodding off.|$|E
5|$|According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Penda became king in 626, ruled for 30 years, and was 50 {{years old}} at the time of his accession. That he ruled for 30 years should not be taken as an exact figure, since the same source says he died in 655, which would not {{correspond}} to the year given for the beginning of his reign unless he died in the thirtieth year of his reign. Furthermore, that Penda was truly 50 years old <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> reign is generally doubted by historians, mainly because of the ages of his children. The idea that Penda, at about 80 years of age, would have left behind children who were still young (his son Wulfhere was still just a youth three years after Penda's death, according to Bede) has been widely considered implausible. The possibility has been suggested that the Chronicle actually meant to say that Penda was 50 {{years old at}} the time of his death, and therefore about 20 in 626.|$|E
5|$|Although Baggio {{initially}} {{struggled with}} injuries <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{first season with}} Milan, he {{came back into the}} starting line-up and was appointed the main penalty taker. He helped Milan win the Serie A title, notably scoring a goal against his former team Fiorentina from a penalty in the title-deciding match. Baggio finished the season with 10 goals in all competitions, in 34 appearances; 7 of his goals were scored in Serie A, in 28 appearances, and he also provided 10 assists in Serie A. He became one of the six players to win the Scudetto in consecutive years with different teams, and was voted the club's best player of the season by the fans, despite playing a more creative role. Towards the end of the season, Baggio had disagreements with Capello due to limited playing time, as Capello believed he was no longer fit enough to play for 90 minutes; although Baggio frequently started matches, he was often substituted during the second half.|$|E

5|$|Although Sidney was the {{architect}} of the cemetery, it was superintendent John Boetcher that gave Oakwood its charm. Boetcher became superintendent in 1871 and continued in the position until 1898. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tenure, Oakwood was said to be quite crude. During Boetcher's tenure Oakwood's most important icons were built: the Earl Chapel and Crematorium, the Warren Chapel Mortuary, the keeper's house, the office lodge, numerous mausolea, and both the 101st Street and 114th Street entrances (including a bridge over the Troy and Boston Railroad on Oakwood's western border to the 101st Street entrance). Boetcher incorporated exceptional landscape design techniques during his tenure; Oakwood developed shifting landscape scenery: some areas are dominated by flowing lawns while others comprise dense foliage. Boetcher brought in rare and foreign plants to help beautify the cemetery, including umbrella pines and Colorado blue spruce.|$|E
5|$|Equally, Gaudí {{stood out}} as {{interior}} decorator, decorating {{most of his}} buildings personally, from the furnishings to the smallest details. In each case {{he knew how to}} apply stylistic particularities, personalising the decoration according to the owner's taste, the predominant style of the arrangement or its place in the surroundings—whether urban or natural, secular or religious. Many of his works were related to liturgical furnishing. From the design of a desk for his office <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career to the furnishings designed for the Sobrellano Palace of Comillas, he designed all furnishing of the Vicens, Calvet, Batlló and Milà houses, of the Güell Palace and the Bellesguard Tower, and the liturgical furnishing of the Sagrada Família. It is noteworthy that Gaudí studied some ergonomy in order to adapt his furnishings to human anatomy. Many of his furnishings are exhibited at Gaudi House Museum.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1967 adaptation, {{the rights}} to the film {{remained}} with Columbia Films until 1989 when the studio, and {{the rights to}} their intellectual property portfolio was acquired by the Japanese company Sony. In 1999, following legal action between Sony Pictures Entertainment and MGM/UA, Sony traded the rights to Casino Royale for MGM's partial-rights to Spider-Man. This led to Eon Productions making the 2006 film Casino Royale. The film stars Daniel Craig as Bond, supported by Eva Green as Vesper Lynd and Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre; Judi Dench returned for her fifth Bond film as Bond's superior, M. Casino Royale is a reboot, showing Bond <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career as a 00-agent and overall stays true to the original novel.|$|E
