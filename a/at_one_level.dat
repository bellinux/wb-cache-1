25|$|The Tibetan Buddhism {{tradition}} emphasizes an instructive and devotional {{relationship to}} a guru; this may involve devotional practices known as guru yoga which are congruent with prayer. It also appears that Tibetan Buddhism posits {{the existence of}} various deities, but the peak view of the tradition is that the deities or yidam are no more existent or real than the continuity (Sanskrit: santana; refer mindstream) of the practitioner, environment and activity. But how practitioners engage yidam or tutelary deities will depend upon the level or more appropriately yana at which they are practicing. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>level,</b> one may pray to a deity for protection or assistance, taking a more subordinate role. At another level, one may invoke the deity, on a more equal footing. And {{at a higher level}} one may deliberately cultivate the idea that one has become the deity, whilst remaining aware that its ultimate nature is śūnyatā. The views of the more esoteric yana are impenetrable for those without direct experience and empowerment.|$|E
25|$|In the (more recent) OpenPGP specification, trust {{signatures}} {{can be used}} {{to support}} creation of certificate authorities. A trust signature indicates both that the key belongs to its claimed owner and that the owner of the key is trustworthy to sign other keys <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>level</b> below their own. A level 0 signature is comparable to a web of trust signature since only the validity of the key is certified. A level 1 signature is similar to the trust one has in a certificate authority because a key signed to level 1 is able to issue an unlimited number of level 0 signatures. A level 2 signature is highly analogous to the trust assumption users must rely on whenever they use the default certificate authority list (like those included in web browsers); it allows the owner of the key to make other keys certificate authorities.|$|E
25|$|Payment on the {{new deal}} was {{originally}} expected {{to be based on}} the fighter's spot in the official UFC rankings, with the exception of the UFC champions. Fighters ranked No. 1 to 5 would be paid <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>level,</b> No. 6 to 10 at a lower level, No. 11 to 15 below that, and unranked fighters at a base rate. The payments will remain consistent regardless of where the athletes' bouts air. In addition to the per-fight rate, fighters will also receive royalty payments representing 20 percent of any UFC merchandise sold that bears their likeness. The royalty program will also include retired fighters and continue in perpetuity. The deal itself is reported to be worth 70 million dollars which is what the fighters will be paid over the next six years which is roughly 260 thousand dollars per UFC fight card. In April 2015, the UFC announced that they scrapped the rankings idea and that payment will be based on the fighter's number of bouts in the octagon, with different tiers (1-5 fights, 6-10 fights, 11-15 fights, and 16-20 fights). Exceptions are made in the event of title fights, with champions and title challengers receiving greater compensation. The kits were revealed on June 30, 2015. All kits will feature the fighter's name on the back of the jersey and fighters will have the option to choose between a universal kit or a country kit, related to his nationality. There is also a champion kit, designed to be used only by title holders.|$|E

500|$|Among other Harrison biographers' {{interpretations of}} the lyrics, Ian Inglis writes of Harrison's unwelcome [...] "evangelical" [...] message {{regarding}} [...] "the consequences of a life of selfishness and greed which finds no place for 'the Lord'". In contrast, Leng views the verses as [...] "the singer's inner conversation", in which Harrison acknowledges the futility of his own existence, {{at a time when}} he felt overwhelmed by his success as a solo artist following the Beatles' break-up in 1970. Of the apparent sermonising in the choruses, Leng concludes: [...] "'The Lord Loves the One' conveys the same basic message as 'what you put in is what you get out,' so, <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>level,</b> it's more a matter of common sense than divine revelation." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{opposite}} of homologous organs are analogous organs which do similar jobs in two taxa {{that were not}} present in their last common ancestor but rather evolved separately. For example, the wings of insects and birds evolved independently in widely separated groups, and converged functionally to support powered flight, so they are analogous. Similarly, {{the wings of a}} sycamore maple seed and the wings of a bird are analogous but not homologous, as they develop from quite different structures. A structure can be homologous <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>level,</b> but only analogous at another. Pterosaur, bird and bat wings are analogous as wings, but homologous as forelimbs because the organ served as a forearm (not a wing) in the last common ancestor of tetrapods, and evolved in different ways in the three groups. Thus, in the pterosaurs, the [...] "wing" [...] involves both the forelimb and the hindlimb. Analogy is called homoplasy in cladistics, and convergent or parallel evolution in evolutionary biology.|$|E
500|$|The CCDI was cumbersome; twenty-seven {{separate}} procedures had to {{be completed}} before an official could be placed under investigation. Other problems were institutional; for example, the commission had no organisation below the provincial level. In response to the CCDI's failures, the 1955 National Conference established the CCC. Delegates noted that the CCDI's problems were its lack of independence from party committees {{and the lack of}} meaningful collaboration between a control commission <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>level</b> and those at higher levels. The institutional balance favouring party committees led some (such as Gao Gang and Rao Shushi) to pack local commissions for discipline inspection (CDI) with loyalists who had no interest in carrying out their responsibilities. The control commissions had the power to appeal committee decisions, and were required to report their work to the higher-level control commission. Unlike the CCDI, the CCC had an organisation below the provincial level. It was empowered to [...] "examine, approve, and change decisions by lower control committees", was required to verify the composition of control committees at the provincial level and below and had the power to investigate unreliable elements at will. Bonds were forged with the Ministry of Supervision (MOS) and the Supreme People's Procuratorate to strengthen the anti-corruption agencies' control of [...] "the rapidly expanding party organisation and an increasingly elaborate state bureaucracy".|$|E

These mRNA and proteins interact with each other with various degrees of specificity. Some diffuse around the cell. Others are bound to cell membranes, interacting with molecules in the environment. Still others pass through cell membranes and mediate long range signals to other cells in a multi-cellular organism. These molecules and their interactions comprise a gene regulatory network. A typical gene regulatory network looks something like this: ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the postwar}} period, {{the art of}} the short story again flourished. Among its most {{respected}} practitioners was Flannery O'Connor, who developed a distinctive Southern gothic esthetic in which characters acted <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>level</b> as people and at another as symbols. A devout Catholic, O'Connor often imbued her stories, among them the widely studied [...] "A Good Man is Hard to Find" [...] and [...] "Everything That Rises Must Converge", and two novels, Wise Blood (1952); The Violent Bear It Away (1960), with deeply religious themes, focusing particularly on the search for truth and religious skepticism {{against the backdrop of the}} nuclear age. Other important practitioners of the form include Katherine Anne Porter, Eudora Welty, John Cheever, Raymond Carver, Tobias Wolff, and the more experimental Donald Barthelme.|$|E
2500|$|Materialism {{is often}} {{associated}} with reductionism, according to which the objects or phenomena individuated <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>level</b> of description, if they are genuine, must be explicable in terms of the objects or phenomena at some other level of description—typically, at a more reduced level. Non-reductive materialism explicitly rejects this notion, however, taking the material constitution of all particulars to be consistent with the existence of real objects, properties, or phenomena not explicable in the terms canonically used for the basic material constituents. Jerry Fodor influentially argues this view, according to which empirical laws and explanations in [...] "special sciences" [...] like psychology or geology are invisible from the perspective of basic physics. A lot of vigorous literature has grown up around the relation between these views.|$|E

The term has also been used to argue that many cannot be expected, for good reasons, to embrace teachings such as that in Humanae Vitae, which in this view are expressions of an ideal. The term had fallen from favor after Pope John Paul II, in the apostolic exhortation written after the previous Synod on the Family in 1980, said: [...] "What is known as 'the law of gradualness' or step-by-step advance cannot be identified with 'gradualness of the law', as if there were different degrees or forms of precept in God’s law for different individuals and situations." ...|$|E

2500|$|But, {{for some}} reason or other, an open-timbered hammer beam roof was not wanted, {{probably}} a decision made from the first, since the trusses are spaced to suit the existing vault exactly. Jackson was therefore instructed to prepare {{a model for the}} new roof, for which he received £20, and he accordingly designed a fan-vaulted ceiling, of wood and plaster, to be put up [...] beneath the old hammer-beam roof, and securely fixed to it. And very ingeniously he did it. The points of the hammerbeams gave him the line for his pendents, the great feature of the later fan-vaulted roofs. From these the ribs of the vaulting spring, and between them he shaped his ceiling in the ordinary way, after the manner of that at Windsor, for example. The hammer-beams themselves gave him a springing for short, low pitched tunnel vaults, running north and south, to connect the wall above the window heads {{with the rest of his}} vaulting. These are stepped, so to speak, and in two levels. If he had run his tunnel vault through <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>level,</b> the crown of it would have run out high above the head of the windows, and necessitated a gable over each window. The hammer-beams and the brackets below them are left to show below the new vault, and are ingeniously worked into the design. All the rest of the old roof is up above, and out of sight. The effect of the whole is successful, and not out of keeping with the windows. A glance at the photograph of the interior will explain the arrangement, which is very difficult to make clear with words only. The design is almost identical with that of the stone vault over the Choir of the Cathedral, the great stone bracket pieces there taking the place of the hammer-beam supports, while the tunnel vaults run through <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
