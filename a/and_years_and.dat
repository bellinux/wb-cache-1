Half of all eruptions occur at or near Kīlauea's summit caldera. Activity there was nearly continuous for much of the 19th century, and after a reprieve between 1894 and 1907, continued onwards until 1924. There have been five historical eruptions at the volcano's relatively southwestern rift zone, and 24 along its more active eastern rift zone, mostly along its upper section.|$|E
500|$|Adam Noah Levine {{was born}} in Los Angeles on March 18, 1979 to Fred Levine, the founder of retail chain M. Fredric, and Patsy (née Noah) Levine, an admissions counselor. He has a brother Michael, two half-siblings Sam and Liza Levine and step-sister Julia Bartolf Milne. Levine's father and {{maternal}} grandfather are both Jewish, while his maternal grandmother was a Protestant. Levine considers himself Jewish, though according to an interview with The Jewish Chronicle, he [...] "has rejected formal religious practice for a more generalized, spiritual way of life." [...] He chose {{not to have a}} Bar Mitzvah as a child, explaining: [...] "I felt as though a lot of kids were trying to cash in ... I just don't think it's the most respectful way to deal with God and beliefs <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> years of cultural heritage." [...] Levine is a nephew of journalist and author Timothy Noah, television producer and writer Peter Noah, and economist Jordan Levine.|$|E

2500|$|After [...] "Normal" [...] aired, {{internet}} sources {{began to}} summarize the rules for True American, which the characters described as a mix of a drinking game and Candy Land where the floor is lava; it also involves shouting the names of American presidents. The idea of True American came from a New Girl writer who played a similar game in college. As she could not remember the game's exact rules, the writers focused on making the game as funny on the page as possible, but only established chanting [...] "JFK! FDR!" [...] and walking on chairs. As the cast {{did not understand the}} game during shooting, the writers created more rules on the spot, advised the actors to [...] "have fun, dig in, jump in" [...] and play it as if [...] "they'd been playing this thing for years <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> years." [...] The high-energy feel of the game and the amounts of coverage made filming True American more challenging for the actors than normal episodes. Producers Dave Finkel, Brett Baer, and writer Luvh Rakhe, came up with most of the obscure American history facts, but much was cut from the finished episode.|$|E

Prior to submitting the photograph for a Pulitzer Prize, Meadows' assignment editor, Fred Sweets, contacted the firefighter, who reportedly {{said he had been}} asked by Meadows to go to the pool and splash water on his head.

A neural approach has been adopted to decipher strings of digits (day <b>and</b> <b>year)</b> <b>and</b> a Markovian strategy to recognize and verify words (month). The final decision module makes an accept/reject decision.

2500|$|Retrograde amnesia is {{inability}} to recall memories before onset of amnesia. One {{may be able}} to encode new memories after the incident. Retrograde is usually caused by head trauma or brain damage to parts of the brain besides the hippocampus. The hippocampus is responsible for encoding new memory. Episodic memory {{is more likely to be}} affected than semantic memory. The damage is usually caused by head trauma, cerebrovascular accident, stroke, tumor, hypoxia, encephalitis, or chronic alcoholism. [...] People suffering from retrograde amnesia are more likely to remember general knowledge rather than specifics. Recent memories are less likely to be recovered, but older memories will be easier to recall due to strengthening over time. Retrograde amnesia is usually temporary and can be treated by exposing them to memories from the loss. Another type of consolidation (process by which memories become stable in the brain) occurs over much longer periods of time/days, weeks, months <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> likely involves transfer of information from the hippocampus to more permanent storage site in the cortex. The operation of this longer-term consolidation process is seen in the retrograde amnesia of patients with hippocampal damage who can recall memories from childhood relatively normally, but are impaired when recalling experiences that occurred just a few years prior to the time they became amnesic.
