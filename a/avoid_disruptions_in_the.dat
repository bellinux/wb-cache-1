In particular, {{in the field of}} robotic co-workers, flexible approaches to obtain collab-orative trajectories becomes important, not only to <b>avoid</b> <b>disruptions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> production cycle, but also because of the repetitive and abundant number of human movements that occur, for example, during an assembly task. This project aims to find such collaborative trajectories by using an inverse kinematics based approach. The solution must be op-timal with respect to accuracy at which the original demonstration can be reproduced, joint limits and efficiency in human robot collaboration. Furthermore, the flexibility of the algorithm with respect to different workspaces is evaluated. The results indicate that the algorithm is capable to adapt natu-ral human demonstrations that take place in arbitrary locations, to the embodiment of a 7 -DoF robotic arm in different types of tasks. ...|$|E

The proposed approach comprises a priority-based media pre-buffer to overcome periods under reduced connectivity. The PMD algorithm aims {{to use the same}} transmission bitrate and overall buffer size as the traditional streaming approach, yet is more likely to overcome interruptions and reduced bitrate periods.

These findings contradict Frank F. Kuo's conclusion that a slide-tape program is superior to the lecture tour. The disparity between the two studies indicates {{the need for further}} research into the effectiveness of this and the other kinds of media presentations now used by academic libraries. VIDEOTAPES, slide/tape presentations, tape recordings for individual use-increasingly these are the means by which students are taught how to use academic libraries. 1 Their popularity is due largely to the practical ad-vantages they offer. They are convenient. They help <b>avoid</b> <b>disruption</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> library, eliminate scheduling problems for the li-brary staff responsible for bibliographic in-struction, and reduce the amount of staff time idvolved in preparing and giving lec-ture tours. But do patrons learn from these media presentations as well as they do from the traditional lecture tour? Or do they learn better? These questions need to be an-swered if academic libraries are to be c~nfident about the effectiveness of their bibliographic instruction programs. 2 This article takes a step toward meeting this need, at least in reference to slide/tape programs.

40|$|Forage {{fish are}} small pelagic fish that are energy {{pathways}} from low to high trophic levels and their high stock biomass makes them a profitable target for large scale fisheries. An ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management (EBFM) is necessary if {{the objective is}} to maintain a functional ecosystem by <b>avoiding</b> <b>disruption</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> food-chain while ensuring profitable resource exploitation. The general objective {{of this study is to}} develop the base for such a fishery approach, linking forage fishes, (mainly herring, Clupea harengus, which is a key forage fish species), and baleen whales (fin, minke and humpback whale; Balenoptera physalus, Balenop-tera acutorostrata, Megaptera novaengliae) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Celtic Sea ecosystem. The spatial distribution of the annual Celtic Sea herring stock was analysed from acoustic survey data using geostatistics. Herring was randomly distributed in patches, influenced by coastal spawning grounds without correlation with temperature and salinity. Observed spatial distribution of baleen whales was fund to be influenced by the distribution of herring and sprat (Sprattus sprattus) suggesting that baleen whales actively targeted these two species. To establish the transfer of energy between prey and predators, energy content of herring, sprat and mackerel (Scromber scombrus) were first measured with bomb-calorimetry. Measures exhibited a high variation pattern caused by maturation status. A significant drop in energy content of fish after spawning is assumed to be an important factor for the quantification of the predation pressure on fish stocks. A simplified individual dynamic energy budget was combined with a model of whale behaviour, in order to quantify their predation on herring. Such modelling allows for testing of different scenarios regarding ecosystem functioning and can help understanding ecosystem links between predator and prey specie...|$|R

40|$|In diesel-hybrid {{autonomous}} power systems, {{a reduced}} number of diesel generators supply {{the power to}} the load and control the frequency of <b>the</b> system <b>in</b> isolation from <b>the</b> utility grid. <b>In</b> these type of systems, frequency variations of consequence {{are more likely to}} occur than in large interconnected power grids, since they feature a relatively small generation capacity and rapid changes in power demand. If generators are not able to maintain frequency within prescribed operational limits during a transient, the assistance of other components is required in order to <b>avoid</b> major <b>disruptions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> power system. <b>In</b> this thesis <b>the</b> use of a virtual synchronous machine (VSM) to support dynamic frequency control in a diesel-hybrid autonomous power system was investigated. The proposed VSM consisted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control of the grid-interface converter of an energy storage system in order to emulate the inertial response and the damping power of a synchronous generator. Furthermore, the damping function of the proposed VSM used an estimated value of the stabilization frequency of the grid, which allowed it to provide proper damping power when <b>the</b> system operated <b>in</b> frequency droop mode.

40|$|It is not {{possible}} to deport the 10 million to 20 million undocumented workers currently <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States without incurring unacceptable political and economic costs. However, there is not a consensus <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States <b>in</b> favor of granting permanent resident status to such undocumented immigrants. This paper presents a possible solution to this impasse. The first element of the proposal is to register undocumented workers who are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States and grant them temporary work permits with repatriation dates spaced {{over a period of years}}. Such a proposal would allow employers to hire workers without penalty. The allocation of repatriation dates could be done by a lottery. Spacing repatriation of undocumented workers over a period of years would <b>avoid</b> a <b>disruption</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> labor market and permit a humane and rational schedule of repatriation. The undocumented workers that do not register and are identified can be deported without disruption of the economy. The second element of this proposal is that, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of undocumented immigrants from Mexico, the registering of undocumented Mexicans be done jointly with Mexico. Mexico has a very extensive network of consular offices <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. The task of registering undocumented workers would be much easier if Mexico registered its own nationals. Further, such an agreement could serve as a framework that would allow Mexican workers controlled access to the U. S. labor market. The number of non-Mexican undocumented workers is smaller, and thus the problem of registering non-Mexican workers is more manageable. There will be cases where implementation of this policy will result in hardship. These issues can be addressed separately once the current crisis is resolved. American immigration policy for the 21 st century is an issue that will have to be further addressed soon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> political agenda of the United States. It is, however, an issue that is better addressed without the shadow of 10 million to 20 million undocumented immigrants hanging over the debate. Mexico and the United States can enter into talks immediately to start crafting an agreement. A well-crafted treaty can be presented to the U. S. Senate next year.

40|$|Anticipating the nonperforming loans {{dynamics}} on {{the basis}} of macroeconomic credit risk models is crucial for shaping adequate economic policy mix to prevent disorderly deleveraging <b>in</b> <b>the</b> banking system. The added value of this paper is twofold. First, we apply reputed conditional risk model referred to as Credit Portfolio View in a regional context to test whether different patterns of registered NPLs during 2003 - 2011 are driven by domestic economic performances in CEE countries. Second, we turn to dynamic panel regressions with fixed effects to determine whether there are material structural differences among CEE economies in terms of reimbursing behaviour. Econometric results confirm that GDP growth is the prominent macroeconomic explanatory variable of nonperforming loans developments among CEE economies. Moreover, the larger the amplitude and standard deviation of the economic cycle are, the higher the NPL ratio jumps during recession period. Monetary conditions are also important, but to a lesser extent. Although labour market indicators do have informational content for modelling NPLs dynamics, their presence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> multivariate panel regressions is affected by existing strong dependency to economic growth variables. Furthermore, fixed effects were not found statistically relevant, suggesting that there are no major differences in terms of credit discipline across the CEE region. Under this setting, continued refraining from promoting domestic legislative initiatives that would impact the reimbursing behaviour is crucial for <b>avoiding</b> a major <b>disruption</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> real economy for many years...|$|R
