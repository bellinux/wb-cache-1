5|$|After Singora {{had been}} destroyed, Sultan Sulaiman's sons were pardoned and {{assigned}} to new positions in Siam. Later generations of Sultan Sulaiman's family were closely connected with Siamese royalty: two of Sulaiman's descendants commanded armed forces led by Prince Surasi in the 1786 conquest of Pattani; Princess Sri Sulalai, a consort of King Rama II <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> King Rama III, was also descended from Sultan Sulaiman. Present-day descendants include Admiral Niphon Sirithorn, a former Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Navy General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the 22nd Prime Minister of Thailand; {{and a family}} of silk weavers at the Muslim village of Phumriang in Surat Thani.|$|E
5|$|As in Africa, dynastic {{struggles in}} Ostrogothic Italy {{provided}} an opportunity for intervention. The young king Athalaric had died on 2 October 534, and a usurper, Theodahad, had imprisoned queen Amalasuntha, Theodoric's daughter <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> Athalaric, {{on the island of}} Martana in Lake Bolsena, where he had her assassinated in 535. Thereupon Belisarius with 7,500 men invaded Sicily (535) and advanced into Italy, sacking Naples and capturing Rome on 9 December 536. By that time Theodahad had been deposed by the Ostrogothic army, who had elected Vitigis as their new king. He gathered a large army and besieged Rome from February 537 to March 538 without being able to retake the city.|$|E
5|$|Cynthia Lennon (née Powell; 10 September 1939 – 1 April 2015) was {{the first}} wife of English {{musician}} John Lennon <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> Julian Lennon.

At the age of 12, she was accepted into the Junior Art School, and was later enrolled in the Liverpool College of Art. John Lennon also attended the college; a meeting with Powell in a calligraphy class led to their relationship.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} the {{coefficient}} of relationship by isonymy Ri to detect familial aggregation of conditions suspected of being under a degree of genetic control was tested on groups <b>of</b> fathers <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> like-sex twins, fathers <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> unlike-sex twins, <b>and</b> fathers <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> singleton controls born from 1977 to 1981 in Scotland. No statistically significant difference of within-group or between-group Ri was found, either for all surnames or for rare surnames only. However, the overall pattern of results for rare surnames showed a measure of agreement with what is already known of the genetics of twinning. The relatively high within-group Ri for <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> unlike-sex twins {{is consistent with a}} maternal genetic influence on dizygous twinning, whereas the relatively high between-group Ri for fathers with <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> unlike-sex twins suggests that paternal as well as maternal genes may be involved. Values of Ri for the parents of like-sex twins raise the possibility of a paternal but not a maternal genetic contribution to monozygous twinning...|$|R

5|$|In 1889, Pilcher married Kathleen Mary Gonne, {{daughter}} of Colonel Thomas Gonne of the 17th Lancers; her sister, Maude Gonne, {{later became a}} prominent Irish nationalist <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> the politician and Nobel laureate Seán MacBride, {{as well as a}} close associate and muse of W.

The couple would have a daughter, Thora, and three sons – Toby, Tommy, and Pat. The elder son, Gonne ("Toby", to his family), became a Judge of the High Court of Justice, while Tommy would be killed at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915, aged 21.|$|E

5|$|The sultanate's {{history was}} {{documented}} in accounts, letters and journals written by British and Dutch East India Company traders; its destruction was discussed {{in books and}} reports authored by representatives of the French embassies to Siam in the mid 1680s.

Sources pertaining to the Singora cannon include articles published in academic journals and letters written by General Sir Harry Prendergast, commander of the Burma Expeditionary Force that captured Mandalay in the third Anglo-Burmese war.|$|E
5|$|After AD 700 {{the pyramid}} served an {{important}} funerary function. Three elite burials have been excavated from the pyramid, two males and a female, accompanied by extremely high quality funerary offerings. The offerings include polychrome ceramics and objects crafted from shell, conch <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> pearl that are inscribed with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic imagery. These associated finds are of sufficient quality {{that it is}} possible that the deceased were members of the royal family. The burials have been dated to the reign of YaxNuunAyiinII, who ruled from AD 769 to 794. During the Terminal Classic some minor changes were made to the temple chambers and there may have been structural reinforcement of the front of the temple. Although it is poorly preserved, the inside of the temple rooms were inscribed with graffiti that is likely to date to this time.|$|E
