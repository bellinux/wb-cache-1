500|$|A common {{comment on}} the novel is the graphic nature of the many acts of torture and murder which are {{depicted}} in the novel. Vargas lets the reader see the realities of an oppressive regime {{with a degree of}} detail not often used by his compatriots in Latin American literature, as Michael Wood suggests in the London Review of Books: [...] "Vargas Llosa ... tells us far more about the details of day-to-day intrigue, and the sordid, sadistic minutiae of torture and murder." [...] Walter Kirn of the New York Times suggests that the [...] "grisly scenes of dungeon interrogations and torture sessions" [...] cast other aspects of the novel in a pale light, draining them of their significance and impact. Similarly, Kirn implies that the [...] "narrative machinery" [...] mentioned by Wood as being somewhat unwieldy also produces a largely superfluous storyline. The plot line centered on Urania Cabral is described by Sturrock as being an emotional centre that focuses the novel, and Wood agrees that her confrontations with past demons hold the readers attention. In contrast, Kirn's review states that Urania's segments are [...] "talky and atmospheric ... seem to be on loan from <b>another</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> book." ...|$|E

2500|$|Under materialism or even {{embodiment}} values, or in {{any system}} that recognizes the validity of ecology as a scientific study of limits and potentials, an ecosystem is a fundamental good. To all who investigate, it seems that goodness, or value, exists within an ecosystem, Earth. Creatures within that ecosystem and wholly dependent on it, evaluate good relative to what else could be achieved there. In other words, [...] good is situated in a particular place and one does not dismiss everything that is not available there (such as very low gravity or absolutely abundant sugar candy) as [...] "not good enough", one works within its constraints. Transcending them and learning {{to be satisfied with}} them, is thus <b>another</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> value, perhaps called satisfaction.|$|E

Apart from the Bishop of Tournai, next to Rolin, {{all the other}} men are bare-headed, even Philip's young heir, {{despite the fact that}} several of them are high-ranking intimates who, like the Duke, wear the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece.
