5|$|Despite {{a winning}} record, {{injuries}} hobbled {{the team for}} the 2009–2010 season. Reserves Batum and Fernández started the season on the inactive list and forward Travis Outlaw soon followed after a serious foot injury early in the season. Most notably, centers Oden and Joel Przybilla suffered season-ending knee injuries, while Roy and Aldridge played through shoulder, hamstring, ankle and knee injuries. Head Coach Nate McMillan was likewise not spared, suffering a ruptured Achilles tendon during practice and was in a walking boot. Because of the void at the center position, Blazers general manager Kevin Pritchard worked out a deal to acquire Marcus Camby from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Steve Blake and Outlaw. Although wins did not come <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>as</b> the season before, the Blazers rallied to finish at 50–32, and finished 6th in the West. Roy underwent surgery after suffering a torn meniscus in his right knee, but returned for Game 4 {{of the first round}} series against the Phoenix Suns. However, the accumulation of injuries was too much to bear, and the short-handed Trail Blazers lost the series 4–2 to the Suns.|$|E
5|$|Gods were {{combined}} {{with each other}} <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>as</b> they were divided. A god could be called the ba of another, or two or more deities could be joined into one god with a combined name and iconography. Local gods were linked with greater ones, and deities with similar functions {{were combined}}. Ra was connected with the local deity Sobek to form Sobek-Ra; with his fellow ruling god, Amun, to form Amun-Ra; with the solar form of Horus to form Ra-Horakhty; and with several solar deities as Horemakhet-Khepri-Ra-Atum. On rare occasion, even deities of different sexes were joined in this way, producing combinations like Osiris-Neith and Mut-Min. This linking of deities is called syncretism. Unlike other situations for which this term is used, the Egyptian practice {{was not meant to}} fuse competing belief systems, although foreign deities could be syncretized with native ones. Instead, syncretism acknowledged the overlap between deities' roles and extended the sphere of influence for each of them. Syncretic combinations were not permanent; a god who was involved in one combination continued to appear separately and to form new combinations with other deities. But closely connected deities did sometimes merge. Horus absorbed several falcon gods from various regions, such as Khenty-irty and Khenty-khety, who became little more than local manifestations of him; Hathor subsumed a similar cow goddess, Bat; and an early funerary god, Khenti-Amentiu, was supplanted by Osiris and Anubis.|$|E

25|$|Jefferson's {{performances}} were distinctive {{because of his}} high-pitched voice and the originality of his guitar playing.

25|$|The average Boer {{nevertheless}} was not thirsty for war. Many did {{not look}} forward to fighting against fellow Christians and, by and large, fellow Christian Protestants.

25|$|Hydrophobicity {{can also}} affect {{the ability of}} {{bacteria}} to form biofilms. Bacteria with increased hydrophobicity have reduced repulsion between the extracellular matrix and the bacterium. Some bacteria species {{are not able to}} attach to a surface on their own successfully due to their limited motility but are instead able to anchor themselves to the matrix or directly to other, earlier bacteria colonists. Non-motile bacteria cannot recognize surfaces or aggregate together <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>as</b> motile bacteria.|$|E

25|$|The most {{interesting}} data from Castle Bravo came from radio-chemical analysis of weapon debris in fallout. Because of {{a shortage of}} enriched lithium-6, 60% of the lithium in the Shrimp secondary was ordinary lithium-7, which doesn't breed tritium <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>as</b> lithium-6 does.

25|$|The {{photoelectric}} effect will cause spacecraft exposed to sunlight {{to develop a}} positive charge. This can be a major problem, as {{other parts of the}} spacecraft are in shadow which will result in the spacecraft developing a negative charge from nearby plasmas. The imbalance can discharge through delicate electrical components. The static charge created by the {{photoelectric effect}} is self-limiting, because a higher charged object doesn't give up its electrons <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>as</b> a lower charged object does.|$|E

25|$|Without error {{correcting}} codes, {{digital audio}} {{would not be}} technically feasible. The Reed–Solomon codes can correct a corrupted symbol with a single bit error just <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>as</b> it can correct a symbol with all bits wrong. This makes the RS codes particularly suitable for correcting burst errors. By far, the most common application of RS codes is in compact discs. In addition to basic error correction provided by RS codes, protection against burst errors due to scratches on the disc is provided by a cross interleaver.|$|E
25|$|QCD {{does not}} violate the CP-symmetry <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>as</b> the electroweak theory; unlike the electroweak theory in which the gauge fields couple to chiral {{currents}} constructed from the fermionic fields, the gluons couple to vector currents. Experiments do not indicate any CP violation in the QCD sector. For example, a generic CP violation in the strongly interacting sector would create the electric dipole moment of the neutron which would be comparable to 10−18e·m while the experimental upper bound is roughly one trillionth that size.|$|E
25|$|Pacu were {{introduced}} in 1994 to the Sepik River, and in 1997 to the Ramu river as a food source, due to overfishing of native species. Local people blame the fish for outcompeting native species, including juvenile crocodiles, {{as well as for}} several attacks on humans. As a primarily vegetarian fish, red-bellied pacu, have also consumed the floating mats of vegetation in the Sepik River, which operated as fish nurseries and crocodile and bird nesting sites. Thus the entire ecosystem has become impoverished and local people cannot subsist <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>as</b> they once did.|$|E

25|$|Groundwater {{pollution}} {{is much more}} difficult to abate than surface pollution because groundwater can move great distances through unseen aquifers. Non-porous aquifers such as clays partially purify water of bacteria by simple filtration (adsorption and absorption), dilution, and, in some cases, chemical reactions and biological activity; however, in some cases, the pollutants merely transform to soil contaminants. Groundwater that moves through open fractures and caverns is not filtered and can be transported <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>as</b> surface water. In fact, this can be aggravated by the human tendency to use natural sinkholes as dumps in areas of karst topography.|$|E
25|$|The ‘‘hiding’’ effect {{takes into}} account the fact that, while small grains are {{inherently}} more mobile than large grains, on a mixed-grain-size bed, they may be trapped in deep pockets between large grains. Likewise, a large grain on a bed of small particles will be stuck in a much smaller pocket than if it were on a bed of grains of the same size, which the Meyer-Peter and Müller formula refers to. In gravel-bed rivers, this can cause ‘‘equal mobility", in which small grains can move just <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>as</b> large ones. As sand is added to the system, it moves away from the ‘‘equal mobility’’ portion of the hiding function to one in which grain size again matters.|$|E
25|$|I return herewith, under {{separate}} cover, the 'Pearl of Great Price.' The 'Book of Abraham,' it {{is hardly}} necessary to say, is a pure fabrication. Cuts 1 and 3 are inaccurate copies of well known scenes on funeral papyri, and cut 2 is a copy {{of one of the}} magical discs which in the late Egyptian period were placed under the heads of mummies.
