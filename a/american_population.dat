5|$|About 175,000 black {{residents}} departed New Orleans {{over the year}} following the storm, while only 100,000 returned, pushing the African <b>American</b> <b>population</b> to 59 percent, from 66 percent previously.

5|$|According to the 2010 census, the {{population}} of the city was 65,870. The population density was 831.9 people per square mile (321.2/km²). There were 26,254 housing units at an average density of 336.5 per square mile (129.9/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 73.4% White, 1.9% Black or African American, 11.7% Native American, 1.9% Asian, 0.2% Pacific Islander, 7.3% from other races, and 3.6% from two or more races. 18.4% of {{the population}} were Hispanics or Latinos of any race. The city's African <b>American</b> <b>population</b> is considerably lower than the U.S. average (1.9% versus 12.6%), while the Native <b>American</b> <b>population</b> is markedly higher (11.7% vs. 0.9%). This is primarily attributable to the city's proximity to several Native American reservations, including the Navajo, Hopi, Havasupai, and Yavapai. Flagstaff's Native American community is chiefly Navajo, and there are about 5,500 people of Navajo ancestry living in the city.|$|E
50|$|The data {{indicate}} that Anzick-1 is from a population directly ancestral to present South American and Central <b>American</b> Native <b>American</b> <b>populations.</b> This rules out hypotheses which posit that invasions subsequent to the Clovis culture overwhelmed or assimilated previous migrants into the Americas. Anzick-1 is less closely related to present North <b>American</b> Native <b>American</b> <b>populations</b> (including a Yaqui genetic sample), suggesting that the North <b>American</b> <b>populations</b> are basal to Anzick-1 and Central and South <b>American</b> <b>populations.</b> The apparent early divergence between North American and Central plus South <b>American</b> <b>populations</b> {{may or may not}} be associated with post-divergence gene flow from a more basal population into North America; however, analysis of published DNA sequences for 19 Siberian populations did not favor the latter scenario. The boy Anzick-1, which is 12,6 thousand years old on the territory of Montana, belonged to Y-haplogroup Q-L54(xM3). Q-L54 is by far the largest haplogroup among Native Americans.|$|R

5|$|While protests {{began in}} the 1970s, {{national}} attention to the issue did not occur until widespread television coverage of college and professional games brought the behaviour of some fans {{to the attention of}} Native Americans. The appearance of the Atlanta Braves in the 1991 World Series and the Washington Redskins at the 1992 Super Bowl prompted the largest response because the games were played in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which has a large Native <b>American</b> <b>population.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because Baltimore's {{electorate}} {{is overwhelmingly}} Democratic, whoever won the Democratic primary election {{was seen as}} the favorite over the Republican nominee in the general election.

Kweisi Mfume was the preferred candidate of local politicians, but he opted not to run. Though Carl Stokes and Lawrence Bell, members of the City Council, declared for the race, local leaders were underwhelmed with the quality of declared candidates.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1812, maps of the {{peninsula}} showed a marked increase in buildings: a two-story common prison, a small hospital, officers' quarters, a gunner's house, a turnkey store, fuel sheds, the agent's office and guard house, a bell house, nine sentry boxes, and four oceanside outhouses. Despite this, the facility was severely overcrowded, a problem compounded by attempts at segregating the remaining French prisoners and the few African-Americans from the majority white <b>American</b> <b>population.</b> 2078 prisoners were recorded {{by the end of}} 1812, including 1412 privateers and 572 merchant seamen. More than 3000 arrived over the next two years, including nearly 1000 soldiers captured in the Niagara area.|$|E
5|$|German {{descendants}} inhabit much {{of central}} and southeast-central Texas. Over one-third of Texas residents are of Hispanic origin; while many have recently arrived, some Tejanos have ancestors with multi-generational ties to 18th century Texas. In addition to {{the descendants of the}} state's former slave population, many African American college graduates have come to the state for work recently in the New Great Migration. Recently, the Asian population in Texas has grown—primarily in Houston and Dallas. Other communities with a significantly growing Asian <b>American</b> <b>population</b> is in Austin, Corpus Christi, and the Sharyland area next McAllen, Texas. Three federally recognized Native American tribes reside in Texas: the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe, the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe, and the Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo.|$|E

5|$|The Asian <b>American</b> <b>population</b> in the Bay Area is {{significant}} {{compared to other}} regions in the U.S., concentrated in the Bay Area city of Daly City. At 58.4%, Daly City's Asian <b>American</b> <b>population</b> is larger {{than anywhere else in}} the United States outside of Hawaii. Asian Americans also constitute a majority in Fremont, with significant populations in Sunnyvale and Santa Clara. The cities of San Jose and San Francisco had the third and fourth largest total number of Asian Americans out of every American city. In San Francisco, Chinese Americans constitute 21.4% of the population and constitute the single largest ethnic group in the city. Santa Clara county, and increasingly the East Bay, house a significant Indian American community. The Bay Area is home to over 382,950 Filipino Americans, one of the largest communities of Filipino people outside of the Philippines with the largest proportion of Filipino Americans concentrating themselves within American Canyon, Daly City, Fairfield, South San Francisco and Vallejo. There are more than 100,000 people of Vietnamese ancestry residing within San Jose city limits, the largest Vietnamese population of any city in the world outside of Vietnam. In addition, there is a sizable community of Korean Americans in Santa Clara county, where San Jose is located. East Bay cities such as Richmond and Oakland, and the North Bay city of Santa Rosa, have plentiful populations of Laotian and Cambodians in certain neighborhoods. Pacific Islanders such as Samoans and Tongans have the largest presence in East Palo Alto, where they constitute over 7% of the population.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} has no true song, but its vocalisations include an excited series of tschip calls given by {{unpaired}} or courting males. Other monosyllabic chirps {{are used in}} social contacts, and the flight call is a harsh teck. A study comparing the vocalisations of the introduced Missouri population with those of birds from Germany showed that the US birds had fewer shared syllable types (memes) and more structure within the population than the European sparrows. This may have resulted from {{the small size of}} the founding North <b>American</b> <b>population</b> and a consequent loss of genetic diversity.|$|E

5|$|The Northwest Territory {{was formed}} by the Congress of the Confederation on July 13, 1787, and {{included}} all land between the Appalachian Mountains, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the Ohio River. This single territory became the states of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and part of eastern Minnesota. The act established an administration to oversee the territory and had the land surveyed in accordance with The Land Ordinance of 1785. At the time the territory was created, {{there were only two}} American settlements in what would become Indiana: Vincennes and Clark's Grant. The population of the northwest included fewer than 5,000 Europeans. The Native <b>American</b> <b>population</b> was estimated to be near 20,000, but may have been as high as 75,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{freeway and}} {{expressway}} sections of M-53 are officially {{known as the}} Christopher Columbus Freeway as a nod to Macomb County's large Italian <b>American</b> <b>population.</b> This designation {{was approved by the}} Michigan Legislature in 1978. The remainder has been named Van Dyke Avenue or Van Dyke Road. That name honors James A. Van Dyke, a prominent attorney in Detroit in the 19th century. Van Dyke was the prosecutor for Wayne County, as well as both city attorney and mayor of Detroit. The street through Detroit was named in his honor, and as the highway was extended northward, the name was carried with it.|$|E
