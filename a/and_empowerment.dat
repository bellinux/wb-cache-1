5|$|Fear of a Black Planet {{features}} elaborate sound collages {{that incorporate}} varying rhythms, numerous samples, media sound bites, and eccentric loops, reflecting the songs' confrontational tone. Recorded during {{the golden age}} of hip hop, its assemblage of reconfigured and recontextualized aural sources preceded the sample clearance system that later emerged in the music industry. Fear of a Black Planet explores themes about organization <b>and</b> <b>empowerment</b> within the black community, social issues affecting African Americans, and race relations at the time. The record's criticism of institutional racism, White supremacy, and the power elite was partly inspired by Dr. Frances Cress Welsing's views on color.|$|E

5|$|Three related {{targets of}} MDG5 were {{adolescent}} birth rate, contraceptive prevalence and unmet need for family planning (where prevalence+unmet need = total need), which were {{monitored by the}} Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs.

5|$|While {{defended by}} those {{cultures}} {{in which it}} constitutes a tradition, FGC is opposed by many medical and cultural organizations {{on the grounds that}} it is unnecessary and harmful. Short term health effects may include hemorrhage, infection, sepsis, and even result in death, while long term effects include dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, vaginitis and cystitis. In addition FGC leads to complications with pregnancy, labor and delivery. Reversal (defibulation) by skilled personnel may be required to open the scarred tissue. Amongst those opposing the practice are local grassroots groups, and national and international organisations including WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and Amnesty International. Legislative efforts to ban FGC have rarely been successful and the preferred approach is education <b>and</b> <b>empowerment</b> and the provision of information about the adverse health effects as well the human rights aspects.|$|E
