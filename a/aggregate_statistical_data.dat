40|$|INTRODUCTION With the {{increased}} power {{and ease of}} use of computers, methodologists such as economists, demographers, and statisticians are no longer content to use <b>aggregate</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> published in tables. They prefer to use microdata because it allows them to perform policy and other statistical analyses that cannot be attempted when only aggregated data are available. By learning to run statistical packages or write elementary code to modify basic outputs or inputs, methodologists have developed both simple and sophisticated models that give much greater insight than the insights obtained from using aggregate data. Methodologists' direct analysis of databases has placed increased demands on data providers [...] - often programmers or informaticians [...] - to eliminate outliers and has sometimes yielded other improvements in the data or the systems providing the data. An outlier is a data value which lies in the tail of the statistical distribution of a set of data val...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the definition, design, implementation, and deployment of a multi-party computation protocol and supporting web-based infrastructure. The protocol and infrastructure constitute a software application that allows groups of cooperating parties, such as companies or other organizations, to collect aggregate data for statistical analysis without revealing {{the data of}} individual participants. The application was developed specifically to support a Boston Women's Workforce Council (BWWC) study of the gender wage gap among employers within the Greater Boston Area. The application was deployed successfully to collect <b>aggregate</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> pertaining to compensation levels across genders and demographics {{at a number of}} participating organizations. We would like to acknowledge {{all the members of the}} Boston Women's Workforce Council (BWWC), and to thank in particular Christina M. Knowles and Katie A. Johnston, who led the effort to organize participants and deploy the protocol as part of the 100 % Talent: The Boston Women's Compact effort [1, 2]. We would also like to acknowledge the Boston University Initiative on Cities, and in particular Executive Director Katherine Lusk, who brought this potential application of secure multi-party computation to our attention.

40|$|What do {{we imagine}} {{when we think}} about a united Europe? According to the Eurobarometer, which recurrently puts this {{question}} to a sample of citizens from all the countries of the Union, 'freedom to travel, study and work anywhere in the EU': this is the reply given, year after year, by the majority of the interviewees. It is not the Euro, nor democracy, nor peace among nations, but free movement which epitomizes the European Union in the minds of Europeans. Ettore Recchi describes the free movement regime of the EU in terms of both its policies and the experiences of the people involved – that is, mobile European citizens. With a particular focus on their integration paths, political participation and identifications, this book draws on large cross-national surveys of this specific population carried out between 2004 and 2012, as well as in-depth interviews and <b>aggregate</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> from a plethora of sources. Based on an unprecedented wealth of empirical information, but also on a thorough examination of the historical and legal underpinnings of free movement rights in the EU, this is essential reading for scholars and practitioners of migration, EU studies, international relations and politics. But it offers food for thought to social and political theorists as well, helping to assess the extent to which this unique frontierless migration regime bolsters denationalization and spearheads a cosmopolitan order in the making.

30|$|In-depth {{analysis}} of EDR time series characteristics requires data integrity tests, which check the EDR feature data for completeness and correctness. As {{part of the}} eASiMoV framework (electrical grid Analysis, Simulation, Modeling, and Visualization), we developed the Java-based software eTSAnalyzer (energy Time Series Analyzer), which analyzes EDR <b>data</b> and generates <b>statistical</b> hierarchical and <b>aggregated</b> metadata based on basic <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> characteristics (minima, maxima, average, deviation, and the median) in the time domain [36]. With a {{direct access to the}} Hadoop cluster, eTSAnalyzer first checks EDR data files for missing or duplicate files. In the latter case, the most complete and correct data file is further processed. In the second analysis stage, each EDR data file content is analyzed. Since one characteristics dataset per second is expected and each dataset contains one timestamp, the analysis process is straightforward. Missing and multiple datasets as a consequence of possible problems during data transfer or storage are identified, and appropriate metadata together with <b>aggregated</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> in the time domain are generated. Based on this hierarchical metadata, the interactive Java-based visualization tool eMetaVis (energy Metadata Visualizer) creates a compact and informative graphical representation, which gives a quick overview of huge datasets. Based on statistical analysis, the expected EDR data value ranges are calculated. Interactive visual outlier detection is enabled via data range limit control. The analysis and visualization software are embedded into the BReSoC (Broker-based Remote Software Control) framework, which enables remote control of the related software even on Android-based mobile devices. The introduced software frameworks and the tools are at advanced stage of development and currently not yet available as open source.|$|R

To reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for health improvement set by Unites Nations, {{it is important to}} develop instruments for monitoring health status. To gain full benefit from Information Systems, these instruments must be fully implemented and customized for the users and their needs. The thesis includes two studies on the real world value of user documentation in the health management information system DHIS 2, with a particular focus on its implementation in Malawi. DHIS 2 is a software used for the collection, validation, analysis and presentation of <b>aggregate</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>data.</b> This study addresses the current usability of DHIS 2 and the value of its user documentation. It reviews literature about software usability and user documentation. It covers various types of documentation and analyzes how the documentation of DHIS 2 fits in with this. The studies apply both quantitative and qualitative methods. One study is a questionnaire with qualitative and quantitative questions (mixed methods research) that surveys workers in Malawi who enter and analyze data, using DHIS 2. The study participants are Malawian Health Management Information System officers from the 29 administrative districts. The second study is a non-participant observation study of students at University of Oslo using DHIS 2 for the first time. Important positive findings of the study were a reported high level of satisfaction with the use of DHIS 2. All the surveyed participants would recommend the use of DHIS 2 to other countries. The data indicate that the software s error messages are particularly useful. The user manual is also highly valued by a portion of the users. Among the more concerning findings was that one third of the participants reported not {{to be aware of the}} user manual.

40|$|Détang-Dessendre С, Piguet V., Schmitt В. - Life Cycle Variability in the Microeconomic Determinants of Urban-Rural Migration The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to provide an analytical framework that would make it possible to identify the factors that account for individual mobility as a function of the position in the life cycle and of the geographic - i. e. urban or rural - origin. We start with the hypothesis that migration decisions result from a complex calculus where the individual aims at satisfying certain needs (occupational and residential) in the face of certain constraints (financial, familial or educational) while taking into account the local levels of the supply of labour, housing, environment, availability of services, etc. Those needs and constraints differ at every stage of an individual's life cycle. The probability of migration between 1982 and 1990 is estimated using a national sub-sample extracted from the French Permanent Demographic Sample (EDP). The results show that, among individuals aged 15 to 24 in 1982, occupational concerns have a significant effect on migration choice, especially among the young who were living in a rural area in 1982. Among 25 - 44 year-olds, family structure (including the birth of children) and the type of accommodation play a prominent role in accounting for migration, while the occupation seems less important. Among the older age groups (those who were aged 45 to 64 in 1982), retirement combined with changes in family structure (the empty nest stage) affects the probability of migration, particularly for individuals who were residing in an urban area at the beginning of the period. Détang-Dessendre С, Piguet V., Schmitt В. - Los déterminantes micro-económicos de las migraciones urbano-rurales: variabilidad en función de la posición en el ciclo de vida Este estudio présenta un modelo analitico para identificar los factores explicativos de la movilidad de los individuos segun su posición en el ciclo de vida y segun su origen geográ- fico (urbano, rural). Partimos de la hipótesis segun la cual la decision de migrar es el resultado de un arbitraje para satisfacer, bajo restricciones (financieras, familiares, de cualificación, etc.), ciertas necesidades (profesionales y residenciales) teniendo en cuenta la oferta local de trabajo, la vivienda, oferta cultural, servicios a particulares, etc. Taies necesidades y restricciones varian a lo largo del ciclo de vida del individuo. La estimación de la probabilidad de migrar entre 1982 y 1 990, llevada a cabo para una sub-muestra nacionál extraída de la muestra demográfica permanente (EDP), muestra que, entre los individuos de edades comprendidas entre los 15 y 24 aňos en 1982, las razones profesionales contribuyen de manera significativa a explicar la decision de migrar, especialmente entre los jóvenes que residían en medio rural en 1982. La estructura familiar (crecimiento de la familia) y el régimen juridico de ocupación de la vivienda juegan un papel fundamental para explicar las migraciones de los individuos de 25 a 44 aňos, mientras que la situación profesionál parece secundaria para este grupo. Entre los individuos que tenian entre 45 y 64 aňos en 1982, la jubilación, asociada con cambios de la estructura familiar (independencia de los hijos), influye sobre la probabilidad de migrar, especialmente entre los individuos que residían en medio urbano al inicio del periodo. The decision to move calls into play an intricate network of factors. It involves the composition of the family, the residence and the occupation before leaving, but also those that are expected as a result of migration. The characteristics of the places of origin and destination, job opportunities and life style, concern for the spouse 'sjob, the psychological need for change and many other factors enter into the picture. Cécile Détang-Dessendre, Virginie Piguet and Bertrand Schmitt focus here on occupational, familial and residential factors, measured at the individual level (using INSEE 's Permanent Demographic Sample) as well as at the level of the district or urban area (from <b>aggregate</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>data).</b> They find that the influence of the family, the home and the job change over the life cycle while the prospect of retirement becomes important after 50. These determinants are also affected by the characteristics of the place of origin and the individual's prior migration history. Détang-Dessendre Cécile, Piguet Virginie, Schmitt Bertrand.

40|$|The {{foundation}} for this thesis {{is an ongoing}} discussion about quality in Swedish elderly care: Which {{are the most important}} factors that contribute to elderly care in terms of satisfaction among older persons, and what are the primary reasons for their differences? Aims. The principal aim was to examine what determines satisfaction with elderly care in home care and nursing homes, using the perspective of older persons (Studies I and II). The secondary aim was to analyze why these determinants differ, using the perspective of care workers, managers, and observers (Studies III and IV). Methods. Study I analyzed <b>aggregated</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> from the level of municipalities and districts (N = 324) based on the Swedish elderly care quality reports “Open Comparisons”, while Study II analyzed individual data based on the original ratings in the annual, nationwide elderly surveys (N = 95, 000). Study III describes field observations and interviews with care workers and managers in two municipalities, one with a high rating for user satisfaction and one with an average rating. Study IV describes investigations in these two municipalities concerning their organizing principles and departmental level management climate. Results. The results relating to the principal aim showed that process factors (such as respect, information, and influence) are related considerably more closely than structural factors (such as budget, staffing levels, and training levels) to satisfaction with care. Other process factors (such as treatment, safeness, staff and time availability) were also able to alleviate person factors (such as health, anxiety, and loneliness). Moreover, the results relating to the secondary aim showed that differences in user-oriented elderly care are mainly due to interpersonal factors between the caregiver and the older person. Care workers, however, reported that other factors (such as organizing principles and leadership support) influence the quality of the care process. Overall, older persons who receive home care generally report higher satisfaction with care than those in nursing homes, and feeling less safe. It is possible that differences in the process of aging explain this. Value. This thesis shows that satisfaction with elderly care can be largely explained by psychological quality at the individual level. The sizes of structural resources and organizing principles at the municipal level have minimal effect (< 5 %). The thesis also presents a theoretical multiple-level Quality Agents Model to explain the sources of differences in satisfaction with care, and it presents recommendations for elderly care practices. A renewed focus on the psychology of satisfaction may {{contribute to the development of}} quality in elderly care.

40|$|International audienceDescribing {{the complex}} links between food and {{environment}} {{is a relatively}} recent research field, starting from the so-called “ecology of food”, a university discipline taught in Germany since 1987. In other European countries, this research domain is integrated in environmental science or in agricultural science. However the “grey” literature started in the 1970 s (Moore-Lappé, 1971), and the very first scientific publications in the 1980 s (e. g. Gussow et Clancy, 1986), encouraged by the Stockholm environment summit of the United Nations in 1972. Since then, environmental assessment methods have been refined and applied to various products, {{in order to help}} producers and industries to improve food production and processes from an environmental point of view. From a systemic point of view, analyses from production to consumption have questioned the compatibility of environmental concerns and other aspects of food, such as nutrition or budget. According to American studies, a diet that would conform to nutritional recommendations in the USA would imply deep changes in the occupation of agricultural surfaces (Young et Kantor, 1999). In particular, a transfer of surfaces in favor of fruit, vegetable and legume production would be required. The question of the environmental benefit of a vegetable-based diet is tackled in Gussow (1995). Among several diets tested in Duchin (2005), the Mediterranean-type vegetable-based diet was shown to satisfy both nutritional and environmental requirements, while reducing the pressure of agri-food systems on the environment. Moreover, Goulet et al. (2008) confirmed its compatibility with price concerns. Recent advances (Perignon et al. 2016) analyzed the compatibility of nutritional, financial and acceptability aspects of food products with the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. They constitute a step in the multicriteria approach of food products, although based on <b>aggregated</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>data</b> rather than on specific well-described products as in (Bourguet et al. 2013; Thomopoulos et al. 2015). In Seconda et al. (2017), the environmental issue is approached in relation with organic food consumption. An increasing number of studies focus on the role of transportation in food systems. According to Pretty et al. (2005), national road transport for food distribution and shopping {{is an important part of}} food-related environmental costs in Great Britain. The scenarios they propose to reduce environmental costs could drastically reduce the environmental costs, up to 90 %, e. g. by reducing the distance between production and consumption, and by opting for ecological means of transportation. This tendancy, confirmed by other works, is however balanced by Schlich et Fleissner (2005), who insist on the greater importance of the organization and size of the production-processing-distribution chain in energetic efficiency, studied on two food products in Germany. In the case of the bread chain, a study led by Reinhardt (2005) shows that, concerning energy, the means of transportation chosen by consumers to go and buy a kilo of bread can annihilate the benefit of the most economic breadmaking process. Although home-made bread requires twice more energy than industrial bread, and a quarter more than artisanal bread, home-made bread becomes the most ecological solution for consumers who drive to go shopping on more than 250 meters and 500 meters, respectively. In the proposed paper, data and expertise were collected to provide information and arguments about several issues: about the main criteria of good bread in terms of environmental, nutritional, sensory and sanitary aspects; then, about ways to achieve them in the wheat-to-bread chain, while maintaining affordable prices. Computation for determining the best compromise between the various desired criteria is a challenge, since not all of them are compatible. Several scenarios are explored to highlight tensions between desired criteria, problem formulation and solution analysis such as best- and worst-case scenarios. Hence the approach demonstrates the interest of information systems and computational methods for decision support in agricultural and food policies...|$|R
