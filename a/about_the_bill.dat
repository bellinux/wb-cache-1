Malcolm insists it is not <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> and fetches a knife and {{chopping}} board. Archie and Malcolm are to play stabscotch, with the winner paying. Malcolm is quick but Archie is slower, repeatedly stabbing himself. Craig pulls the knife from Archie, inadvertently slashing Anya. She collapses as blood splatters. Anya is dead, and Malcolm formulates a story blaming Archie, but Archie has called a prison contact who will remove the body.|$|E

500|$|... "The Bill" [...] {{opens with}} the mundane {{image of a}} number of men eating at a {{restaurant}} and arguing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> but then [...] "takes that familiar scenario and pushes it to impressively baroque extremes". In a reversal of the norm, all diners want to pay the whole bill, rather than wanting to limit their payment. In this dispute, [...] "The Bill" [...] explores themes of masculinity, losing face, competitiveness, passive aggression and rivalry. Andrew Billen, writing in The Times, compared this aspect of the episode to Mad Dogs, which had also starred Glenister; one critic suggested that Glenister's character in Mad Dogs and Craig in [...] "The Bill" [...] are close. The characters tell [...] "well-rehearsed anecdotes and blokey jokes", while Craig is [...] "all flash-cash and inappropriate comments to the waitress". Pemberton's Malcolm, for Michael Hogan of the Daily Telegraph, [...] "appeared to have wandered in" [...] from a Mike Leigh production; a number of critics commented on his striking hairpiece. All four of the men are unpleasant people.|$|E
500|$|Fillmore {{presided over}} some of the most momentous and passionate debates in American history as the Senate debated whether to allow slavery in the territories. [...] The ongoing {{sectional}} conflict had already excited much discussion when on January 21, 1850, President Taylor sent a special message to Congress urging the admission of California immediately and New Mexico later, and that the Supreme Court settle the boundary dispute whereby the state of Texas claimed much of what is now the state of New Mexico. On January 29, Henry Clay introduced what was called the [...] "Omnibus Bill". The bill would give victories to both North and South: [...] it would admit California as a free state, organize territorial governments in New Mexico and Utah, and ban the importation of slaves into the District of Columbia for sale and export out of it. It would also toughen the Fugitive Slave Act, as resistance to enforcement in parts of the North was a longtime Southern grievance. Clay's bill provided for the settlement of the Texas-New Mexico boundary dispute; the status of slavery in the territories would be decided by those living there (known as popular sovereignty). Taylor was unenthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> and it languished in Congress, but Fillmore, after hearing weeks of debate, in May 1850 informed Taylor that if senators divided equally on the bill, he would cast his tie-breaking vote in favor. He did his best to keep the peace among the senators, reminding them of the vice president's power to rule them out of order, but was blamed for failing to maintain it when a physical confrontation between Mississippi's Henry S. Foote and Missouri's Thomas Hart Benton broke out on April 17, with Foote pointing a gun at his colleague as Benton advanced on him.|$|E

The message asserted [...] "It is unfortunate that Uganda is now being judged on the actions of opportunists whose ideas are based on violence and blackmail and even worse, on the actions of aid attached strings. (Homosexuality). It is regrettable that government is pretentiously expected to observe their 'human rights', yet, by their own actions, they have surrendered their right to human rights." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{the focus}} of the festival is Lexington style barbecue, several vendors of the eastern variety can also be found, {{sparking}} mild (and sometimes not so mild) controversy. [...] The battle of Lexington style vs. eastern style has even gone as far as the state government. [...] In 2006, North Carolina House Bill 21 and North Carolina Senate Bill 47 were introduced and would have made the Lexington Barbecue Festival the official barbecue festival of North Carolina. [...] A separate amended bill, North Carolina House Bill suggested making the Lexington Barbecue Festival the official food festival of North Carolina. [...] Neither garnered enough support to pass, as nearly half of the state favors eastern style barbecue, sparking genuine controversy <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> incidentally creating an [...] "official state barbecue" [...] (as opposed to just the festival) with either Lexington or eastern style.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} {{legislative}} session in 2004, Anderson was the House sponsor of a [...] "payday loan" [...] bill to regulate short-term, high-interest loans. The bill was passed and {{signed into law}} by Gov. Frank Murkowski in June 2004. [...] Critics charges that the new law did not regulate loaners enough, still permitting them to charge fees for payday loans that amounted to interest rates of over 300 percent when calculated on an annual percentage basis. An Associated Press wire story <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> noted that Anderson had received campaign contributions of $500 each (for a total of $1000) from the two co-owners of Cash Alaska, a payday lending company that had also hired former state senator Tim Kelly to push for the bill. (The Senate sponsor of the bill, John Cowdery, had received a $500 campaign contribution from one of the owners of the business).|$|E

2500|$|It is {{the future}} of the students, not the future of the parents, that is imperiled by today's decision. If a parent keeps his child out of school beyond the grade school, then the child will be forever barred from entry into the new and amazing world of {{diversity}} that we have today. The child may decide that that is the preferred course, or he may rebel. It is the student's judgment, not his parents', that is essential if we are to give full meaning to what we have said <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> of Rights and of the right of students to be masters of their own destiny. [...] If he is harnessed to the Amish way of life by those in authority over him and if his education is truncated, his entire life may be stunted and deformed. The child, therefore, should be given an opportunity to be heard before the State gives the exemption which we honor today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Opponents of the bill, such as Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY), were {{concerned}} that the measure took a step too far. Meeks said that [...] "I remain committed to doing {{everything in my power}} to support a positive outcome in that nation. But I believe vehemently that unilateral action by the United States is not the answer." [...] Meeks also argued that the bill [...] "does not advance U.S. interests, it will not help the people of Venezuela and it sends the message to our regional allies that we don't care much about what they think." [...] Regional groups like UNASUR, the Caribbean Community, and the Organization of American States have all supported the government instead of the protestors. Fourteen House members wrote a letter to President Barack Obama <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> in which they said [...] "as unilateral U.S. intervention and sanctions have caused deep resentment throughout Latin America, these are not the right tools for our regional policy in instances where they lack any significant regional backing." ...|$|E
2500|$|As vice president, Fillmore had {{presided over}} some of the most momentous and passionate debates in American history as the Senate debated whether to allow slavery in the western territories. The ongoing {{sectional}} conflict had already excited much discussion when on January 21, 1850, President Taylor sent a special message to Congress urging the admission of California immediately and New Mexico later, and that the Supreme Court settle the Texas boundary dispute. On January 29, Henry Clay introduced an Omnibus bill which combined the four diverse subjects under discussion. His legislative package included the admission of California as a free state, the cession by Texas of its conflicting northern and western territorial claims to the federal government in return for debt relief, the establishment of New Mexico and Utah territories, a ban on the importation of slaves into the District of Columbia for sale, and a more stringent fugitive slave law. The status of slavery in the territories of the Mexican Cession would be decided by those living there; this doctrine of [...] "popular sovereignty" [...] would overturn the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which had outlawed slavery in territory West of Missouri and North of the 36°30′ parallel. Taylor was unenthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> and it languished in Congress. In May 1850, Fillmore, after hearing weeks of debate, informed Taylor that if senators divided equally on the bill, he would cast his tie-breaking vote in favor.|$|E
