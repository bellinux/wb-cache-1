The album was well received by Rolling Stone and other periodicals upon its release in October 1974. [...] However, {{over the previous}} year, Warner Brothers' publishing arm had become increasingly troubled {{by a lack of}} communication from Polley regarding the status of an escrow account <b>of</b> <b>advance</b> <b>funds.</b> Per their contract, Polley was to deposit $250,000 into a mutually accessible account for safekeeping, which both Warner Publishing and the band could potentially access. But Polley did not reveal the account's whereabouts to Warner Publishing, and he reportedly ignored Warner's demands to do so. [...] As a result, in a letter dated April 30, 1974, WB's publishing arm terminated its relationship with Badfinger, but, other than having the group sign some new contracts, Polley took no action to resolve the Warner's publishing issue.

500|$|After {{the notice}} was reactivated, {{detailed}} planning recommenced (essentially from scratch). Changes {{made to the}} organisation of the force approved ten years earlier were only minor. After many years of notice, there was still skepticism that the deployment would ever occur. The government and army were cautious {{about the timing of}} the commitment of funds; significant funding was only released in late 1988, a few months before deployment. The squadron's equipment deficiencies were valued at $16million, and there was a need to buy $700,000 of equipment immediately. The UN initially estimated the cost of the entire operation at $US1billion, equivalent to its own budget. The reluctance to commit funds ultimately reduced training of the deployed forces; Senator Jo Vallentine said in Parliament that the Namibia operation nearly fell apart due to a lack <b>of</b> <b>advance</b> <b>funding,</b> and Senator Jocelyn Newman called it disgraceful. The UN General Assembly did not approve the UNTAG budget until 1 March 1989, less than two weeks before the advance party deployed and after the deployment of the start-up team. Gration authorised Operation Picaresque on 3 March 1989. In addition to a lack of funds, there was little intelligence on Namibia; the region was [...] "generally unknown to the Australian public, the policy-makers and to the troops and civilians who deployed there".|$|R

40|$|The {{cellular}} {{slime mold}} Dictyostelium has cell-cell connections similar in structure, function, and underlying molecular mechanisms to animal epithelial cells. These similarities {{form the basis}} for the proposal that multicellularity is ancestral to the clade containing animals, fungi, and Amoebozoa (including Dictyostelium) : Amorphea (formerly “unikonts”). This hypothesis is intriguing and if true could precipitate a paradigm shift. However, phylogenetic analyses of two key genes reveal patterns inconsistent with a single origin of multicellularity. A single origin in Amorphea would also require loss of multicellularity in each of the many unicellular lineages within this clade. Further, there are numerous other origins of multicellularity within eukaryotes, including three within Amorphea, that are not characterized by these structural and mechanistic similarities. Instead, convergent evolution resulting from similar selective pressures for forming multicellular structures with motile and differentiated cells is the most likely explanation for the observed similarities between animal and dictyostelid cell-cell connections.

40|$|Public {{international}} {{law requires that}} states and governments inherit ("succeed to") the debts incurred by their predecessors, however ill-advised those borrowings may have been. There are situations in which applying this rule of law strictly {{can lead to a}} morally reprehensible result. Example: forcing future generations of citizens to repay money borrowed in the state's name by, and then stolen by, a former dictator. Among the purported exceptions to the general rule of state succession are what have been labeled "odious debts", defined {{in the early twentieth century}} as debts incurred by a despotic regime that do not benefit the people bound to repay the loans. The absconding dictator is the classic example. The removal of Iraq's Saddam Hussein in 2003 sparked a resurgence of interest in this subject. By enshrining a doctrine of odious debts as a recognized exception to the rule of state succession, some modern commentators have argued, a successor government would be able legally to repudiate the loans incurred by a malodorous prior regime. This, they contend, would have two benefits: it would avoid the morally repugnant consequence of forcing an innocent population to repay debts incurred in their name but not for their benefit, and it would simultaneously force prospective lenders to an odious regime to rethink the wisdom <b>of</b> <b>advancing</b> <b>funds</b> on so fragile a legal foundation. The authors argue that in this recent debate the adjective "odious" has quietly migrated away from its traditional place as modifying the word "debts" (as in "odious debts"), so that it now modifies the word "regime" (as in "debts of an odious regime"). This is a major shift. If this new version of the odious debt doctrine is to be workable, someone must assume the task of painting a scarlet letter "O" on a great many regimes around the world. Who will make this assessment of odiousness and on what criteria? The stakes are high. An unworkable or vague doctrine could significantly reduce cross-border capital flows to sovereign borrowers generally. The authors are skeptical that this definitional challenge can be met. Rather than jettison the whole initiative as quixotic, however, the authors investigate how far principles of private (domestic) law could be used to shield a successor government from the legal enforcement of a debt incurred by a prior regime under irregular circumstances. A wholesale repudiation of all contracts signed by an infamous predecessor may be more emotionally and politically satisfying for a successor government, but establishing defenses to the legal enforcement of certain of those claims based on well-recognized principles of domestic law may be the more prudent path. The authors believe that such defenses exist under U. S. law (and presumably elsewhere) and could be used to address many, although admittedly not all, cases of allegedly odious debts...|$|R
