MethodsA 14 C- 2 -deoxy-glucose <b>autoradiography</b> <b>method</b> was adopted to determine the overall impact of treatment with 39 herbs on functions of various tissues and organs. Data was measured at 4 hs after a single dose and following the last treatment of repeated doses for a week.

The slope of the regression line represented the cumulative trend of the effect of the herbs (β), and the standard deviation of the slope (Sβ) was compared with those of the untreated animals (t ‘test). All significantly cumulative effect trends were applied with an artificial neural network, which integrated the relationship among Siqi, Wuwei, and Guijing with tissues and organs.

40|$|International audienceNumerous in vivo and {{in vitro}} studies have shown the effects of interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) on insulin and {{glucagon}} secretion. To understand the mechanism of these effects, we performed localization and characterization of IL- 1 receptors (IL- 1 R) in pancreas using a quantitative <b>autoradiography</b> <b>method</b> and recombinant human (rh) [125 I]IL- 1 alpha as a ligand. Frozen sections of pancreas were studied in control (C 3 H/He) and nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice (a model of autoimmune type I diabetes). Compared to splenic IL- 1 R, a very high density of specific IL- 1 R (> 4 -fold that in spleen) {{was found on the}} islets of Langerhans in both strains. In C 3 H/He mice, competition experiments demonstrated the presence of one high affinity binding site (Ki = 3. 4 and 3. 2 x 10 (- 10) M; binding capacity, 137 and 122 fmol/mg protein for rhIL- 1 alpha and rhIL- 1 beta, respectively), comparable to type I IL- 1 R described on T-lymphocytes. In prediabetic NOD mice, these IL- 1 R were expressed with the same density, affinity, and specificity as in the control strain. Before the onset of diabetes, the expression of IL- 1 R protein on the islet cells appears to be entirely normal. In contrast, in diabetic NOD mice, IL- 1 R are sharply decreased, correlating with the intensity of islet destruction. In conclusion, the localization and high density of IL- 1 R on the mouse islets of Langerhans complement previous studies showing the presence of messenger RNA for type I IL- 1 R on the islets of Langerhans. These results support a direct physiological effect of IL- 1 on pancreatic hormones, such as insulin and glucagon, and a potential role of IL- 1 R in the pathogenesis of type I diabetes...|$|E

Methods: This study was performed with a cold spot phantom that had 6 -mm-diameter cold sphenoid defects, a dual-cylinder phantom with an adjusted concentration of 1 : 2, and an ''H''-shaped hot phantom. These were surrounded with water. Phantom images and 18 F-FDG PET images of patients with nasopharyngeal cancer were compared with conventional bismuth germanate PET images. Profile curves for the phantoms were measured as peak-to-valley ratios to define contrast. Intratumoral inhomogeneity and tumor edge sharpness were evaluated on the images of the patients. Results: The contrast obtained with the semiconductor PET scanner (1. 53) was 28 % higher than that obtained with the conventional scanner (1. 20) for the 6 -mm-diameter cold sphenoid phantom. The contrast obtained with the semiconductor PET scanner (1. 43) was 27 % higher than that obtained with the conventional scanner (1. 13) for the dual-cylinder phantom. Similarly, the 2 -mm cold region between 1 -mm hot rods was identified only by the new PET scanner and not by the conventional scanner. The new PET scanner identified intratumoral inhomogeneity in more detail than the conventional scanner in 6 of 10 patients.

The purpose of this task {{is to reduce the}} cycle time necessary to complete analytical evaluations required for surveillance of reservoirs. The development of the digital autoradiography system supports this task. The digital autoradiography system is currently operational and ready for implementation in reservoir surveillance performed in the Materials Test Facility (MTF) at Savannah River Site (SRS). SRS requests design agency (Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratory) concurrence for the implementation of this system and on the establishment, in conjunction with the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL), of the implementation requirements for this system. Stainless steel tritium reservoirs and pinch welded tubes, which have been exposed to tritium for a prolonged period, are destructively evaluated {{at the end of their}} service lives for a variety of reasons. One requirement of this evaluation is to assess the tritium diffusion into the reservoir material. The current method used to determine the geometry and depth of tritium penetration is autoradiography. This technique employs a photographic emulsion and has been effective for a number of years. The primary disadvantage of this technique is the time required to obtain results. The success of the traditional technique is dependent on many variables, such as the proficiency of the operators in conducting sample preparation, the geometry of the sample and the shelf life of the photographic chemicals. If results are not satisfactory, several repetitions are often required and usually add weeks to the total analysis time for the sample.

40|$|Silicon (Si) is omnipresent in nature, {{and it is}} {{involved}} in important but diverse roles in {{a broad range of}} organisms, including diatoms, higher plants and humans. Some organisms, like the diatoms, need high amounts of silicon, and master silicon chemistry to a high extend using several enzymes. Other organisms which need silicon as an essential trace element apparently do not have the capability to handle silicon by any biochemical means and it was hypothesized that silicon chemistry as such plays a major role. The aim of the research described in this thesis was to gain more insight in the mechanisms behind the role of silicon in several organisms and to investigate to what extend silicon chemistry can play a role in biological processes. This study focused on the chemical or biological role of silicon in metal metabolism, on the risks that are connected to silicon polymerization, and on a possible application in biotechnology. For this a study was performed on Baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae which often serves as a model organism for the eukaryotic cell (chapters 3 and 4), diatoms (chapter 5) and biofilms (bacterial communities attached to a surface, chapter 6). A silicon tracer was developed (chapter 2) to aid the studies described in this thesis. No-carrier added 31 Si was produced by a 31 P(n,p) 31 Si reaction by fast neutrons in the nuclear reactor of the Delft University of Technology. Several methods were investigated to remove the side product 32 P. Anion exchange with Dowex resin gave the best results in total activity yield and specific activity, but precipitation with BaCO 3 appeared to be the fastest and cheapest purification method, and sufficiently high yields were obtained as well. It was determined that the 31 Si tracer was in the desired chemical form of silicic acid (Si(OH) 4), and suitable to apply in biological systems. Since yeasts and biofilms do not possess any biochemical means to handle silicon, it is likely that any influence of silicon on these organisms has a chemical origin. This was investigated by studying the interaction of silicon and metals in these organisms. In chapter 3, the influence of silicon (as silicic acid Si(OH) 4) on the growth rate and intracellular accumulation of a number of metals was investigated in Baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a model organism for the eukaryotic cell. It was found that the growth rate was not influenced by silicic acid up to concentrations of 10 mmol per liter growth medium and a slight growth inhibition was observed when silicate was present in an extremely high concentration of 100 mM. Intracellular metal concentrations were investigated in yeast cultures grown in normal culture medium without added silicate (-Si) or with the addition of 10 mmol/L silicate (+Si). Decreased amounts of Co, Mn and Fe were found within +Si grown yeast cultures as compared to -Si grown ones, while increased amounts of Mo and Mg were found. Zn and K were apparently unaffected by the presence of silicon. +Si enhanced yeast growth rate under low Zn 2 + conditions, but decreased growth rate under low Mg 2 + conditions. +Si did not alter the growth rates in high Zn 2 + and Co 2 + media. +Si doubled the uptake rate of Co 2 +, but did not influence that of Zn 2 +. It was proposed that these results could be explained by the formation of a polysilicate layer on the cell wall which changes the cell wall binding capacity for metal ions. The toxicity of silicic acid was compared to germanium (Ge, as GeO 2), a member of the same group of elements as Si (group 14) and sometimes used in literature as a silicon analogue. Ge proved to be far more toxic to yeast than Si and no influence was found of Si on Ge toxicity. It was proposed that these results relate to differences in cellular uptake and that is not always possible to use Ge as a Si analogue. These results also indicated that a chemical mechanism, rather than a biological one, is important. This was further investigated by studying the influence of zinc and magnesium on Si-accumulation at several silicate concentrations in the medium by use of 31 Si(OH) 4 (chapter 4). Si-accumulation fitted well with Freundlich adsorption. Si-release followed depolymerization kinetics, indicating that silicate adsorbs {{to the surface of the}} cell rather than being transported over the cell membrane. Subsequently, adsorbed silicate interacts with metal ions and, therefore, alters the cell’s affinity for these ions. Since several metals are nutritional, these Si interactions can significantly change the growth and viability of organisms. In conclusion, the results show that chemistry is important in Si and metal accumulation in Baker’s yeast, and suggest that similar mechanisms should be studied in detail in other organisms to unravel essential roles of Si. The capability of silicon to adsorb on organic substances was also investigated in biofilms, bacterial communities linked together by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) to study a possible application of silicon chemistry in a biological system. Biofilms have developed mechanisms to accumulate nutrients and organic substrates in their EPS matrix, probably to increase the substrate availability. It may be expected that the binding of ions by the EPS can result in interaction with silicon in the biofilm. Probably this interaction can be used for applications in civil engineering (e. g. biogrouting of soil). To study this the spatial distribution of silicate and phosphate binding in biofilms under different metal conditions was investigated (chapter 6). For this a new <b>autoradiography</b> <b>method</b> using 31 Si (as silicic acid) accompanied by 32 P (as phosphate) was developed. The equilibrium in silicon uptake was reached within minutes, so it was possible to quantify the 31 Si signal, but for 32 P this was not possible. Using this method it was shown that both silicon and phosphate bound heterogeneously to the biofilm. In addition, the metal concentrations in the growth medium affected the biofilm structure as well as the silicate and phosphate binding characteristics of the biofilm. In contrast to yeast and biofilms, diatoms master silicon chemistry to a high extend. Here it was investigated how diatoms cope with high amounts of silicon during valve formation as polymerization at/in vital structures should be avoided (chapter 5). Silicic acid uptake using 31 Si(OH) 4 was studied during valve formation in synchroneously dividing cells of the diatom Pleurosira laevis and other diatoms. Valve formation in diatoms requires bulk uptake and transport of silicic acid to the silica deposition vesicle (SDV). Two earlier proposed mechanisms for silicic acid uptake and transport were investigated: 1) uptake of silicon via silicon transporters (SITs) with subsequent intracellular transport, and 2) (macro) pinocytosis-mediated uptake. The SITs mechanism requires a controlled mechanism to stabilize the high amounts of reactive silicon species to prevent autopolymerization and simultaneously direct these species towards the SDV, whereas this problem does not play a role in the (macro) pinocytosis-mediated mechanism. Experimental data were correlated to systematically derived mathematical models for a compartmental analysis of the possible uptake/transport pathways, including those for both SITs- and (macro) pinocytosis-mediated uptake and transport. This study indicates that the experimental data on silicon uptake during valve formation match best with the model that describes (macro) pinocytosis-mediated uptake. This process not only explains observed surge uptake at high demands for silicon, but also suggests that another pathway exists in which SITs apparently are not involved. The study showed that the pinocytosis mechanism gave a good description of the uptake kinetics that were found in this study. This result offers a simple explanation for how the diatomic cell is able to fulfill its silicon needs without exposing the inner part of the cell to high silicic acid concentrations and the problems related to spontaneous polymerization. Further molecular and (bio) physical-chemical research is needed on diatom biosilicification. The results described in this thesis shed new light on the role of silicon chemistry in several bioprocesses. The influence of silicon on bioprocesses in yeast is probably from chemical origin, resulting from interactions with organic compounds and metals. These interactions, which also occur in biofilms, could also take place in higher organisms as well, and could probably explain at least part of the influence of silicon in biological processes in higher organisms. This may explain why despite many years of research biological binding sites or bioorganical compounds containing silicon have never been found (yet) except for some plants and for bulk consumers like the diatoms and some sponges. But when silicon chemistry itself is taken into account, enzymes and binding sites are probably not needed for silicon to do its job as an essential element. Further research is required on this subject to get clear-cut answers on this matter. Radiation, Radionuclides & ReactorsApplied Science...|$|E

We used a filtration-based binding assay with an SRIF- 14 based competing hot ligand (125 I-[Tyr 11]-SRIF 14), whereas other reports used an autoradiography approach and the SRIF- 28 analog: 125 I-[Leu 8, DTrp 22, Tyr 25]-somatostatin- 28 (Fani et al. 2012 b).

The images were analysed visually on planar and SPECT images and semi-quantitatively on SPECT images by calculating target to background (T/B) ratios. After endarterectomy, immunomorphological evaluation and immunophenotyping were performed on plaque slices. For the ex vivo studies, four additional patients were included and, after in vitro incubation of removed plaques with Tc- 99 m-HYNIC-IL- 2, autoradiography was performed and microSPECT images were acquired. Results Visual analysis defined clear Tc- 99 m-HYNIC-IL- 2 uptake in seven of the ten symptomatic plaques. SPECT/CT allowed visualization in eight of ten. A significant correlation was found between the number of CD 25 + lymphocytes and the total number of CD 25 + cells in the plaque and the T/B ratio with adjacent carotid artery as background (Pearson's r= 0. 89, p= 0. 003 and r= 0. 87, p= 0. 005, respectively). MicroSPECT imaging showed clear Tc- 99 m-HYNIC-IL- 2 uptake within the plaque wall and not in the lipidic core. With autoradiography, only CD 3 + lymphocytes were found to be labelled. Conclusion These in vivo and ex vivo studies confirm the specificity of Tc- 99 m-HYNIC-IL- 2 for imaging activated T lymphocytes in carotid plaques. Tc- 99 m-HYNIC-IL- 2 is a true marker for the inflamed plaque and therefore of plaque instability...|$|R

The original spleen cell donors had been immunized with dinitrophenylated bovine gamma globulin. Specific antibody molecules in sera of recipient mice were separated by isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gels and visualized by 131 I-hapten binding and <b>autoradiography.</b> This <b>method</b> provided a marker for antibody-forming cells derived from a single cell clone. This report describes the history of one clone of cells (E 9) producing IgG antibody to dinitrophenyl. Clone E 9 is long-lived and has been maintained for five transplant generations (over 6 months) by serial transfer of spleen cells into irradiated syngeneic mice. Clone E 9 has the following properties: (1) Antibody production strictly depends on antigen, presented either in vivo or in vitro; (2) Induction of E 9 anti-dinitrophenyl shows specificity for the carrier protein; (3) Antibody is produced in amounts (2 - 3 mg/ml serum) comparable with myeloma-protein production by murine plasmacytomas; (4) In the absence of antigen, memory cells have a lifetime exceeding 28 days...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} {{method for}} the detection of cellular RNAs in tissue sections has been developed. It involves in situ hybridization of tritium-labeled cloned DNA probes to tissue sections and <b>autoradiography.</b> The <b>method</b> was calibrated by using a cloned DNA probe complementary to transcripts abundant in the midgut cells of Drosophila larvae. The improved method also permitted the detection of these transcripts in sectioned embryos where they are much less abundant. The sensitivity of the method can be approximated by quantifying the signal intensities over the hybridizing embryonic midgut cells relative to the larval midgut cells for which the number of transcripts has been estimated. Based on these calculations we estimate that the method is sensitive enough to detect ˜ 100 complementary RNA molecules per cell after 3 days of autoradiographic exposure with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10. The method has been successfully applied to detect transcripts of the homeotic gene Antennapedia. Serial sections allow us to study the spatial pattern of gene expression in the course of development...|$|R

Drug-naive rats readily acquired and subsequently maintained cocaine self-administration behavior during 2 hr daily sessions over a prolonged period. In contrast, although GBR- 12909 was initially selfadministered, both cocaine-naive and cocaine-trained rats failed to maintain self-administration behavior for GBR- 12909 over prolonged periods of time.

The {{cerebral}} microvessels/ capillaries that form the blood–brain barrier (BBB) not only protect the brain from toxic agents in the blood but also pose a significant hindrance to the delivery of small and large therapeutic molecules. Different strategies have been employed to circumvent the physiological barrier posed by blood-brain tumor barrier (BTB). Studies in our laboratory have identified {{significant differences in the}} expression levels of certain genes and proteins between normal and brain tumor capillary endothelial cells. In this study, we validated the non-invasive and clinically relevant Dynamic Contrast Enhancing-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) method with invasive, clinically irrelevant but highly accurate Quantitative <b>Autoradiography</b> (QAR) <b>method</b> using rat glioma model. We also showed that DCE-MRI metric of tissue vessel perfusion-permeability is sensitive to changes in blood vessel permeability following administration of calcium-activated potassium (BKCa) channel activator NS- 1619. Our results show that human gliomas and brain tumor endothelial cells that overexpress BKCa channels can be targeted for increased BTB permeability for MRI enhancing agents to brain tumors.

40|$|Tissue {{distribution}} {{studies of}} drug molecules play {{an essential role}} in the pharmaceutical industry and are commonly undertaken using quantitative whole body <b>autoradiography</b> (QWBA) <b>methods.</b> The growing need for complementary methods to address some scientific gaps around radiography methods has led to increased use of mass spectrometric imaging (MSI) technology over the last 5 to 10 years. More recently, the development of novel mass spectrometric techniques for ambient surface sampling has redefined what can be regarded as ""fit-for-purpose"" for MSI in a drug metabolism and disposition arena. Together with a review of these novel alternatives, this paper details the use of two liquid microjunction (LMJ) -based mass spectrometric surface sampling technologies. These approaches are used to provide qualitative determination of parent drug in rat liver tissue slices using liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA) and to assess the performance of a LMJ surface sampling probe (LMJ-SSP) interface for quantitative assessment of parent drug in brain, liver and muscle tissue slices. An assessment of the utility of these spatially-resolved sampling methods is given, showing interdependence between mass spectrometric and QWBA methods, in particular there emerges a reason to question typical MSI workflows for drug metabolism; suggesting the expedient use of profile or region analysis may be more appropriate, rather than generating time-intensive molecular images of the entire tissue section...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{procedure}} for {{the identification and}} enumeration, in large bacterial populations, of Streptococcus mutans of both xylitol-resistant and xylitol-sensitive phenotypes was developed. Since xylitol-resistant cells have lost the capacity to take up xylitol from the extracellular medium, due to a defect in their fructose-PTS, there is no uptake of [14 C]xylitol by these cells whereas the [14 C]xylitol {{taken up by the}} sensitive cells is used to visualise them by <b>autoradiography.</b> The <b>method</b> was shown to be suitable for laboratory strains as well as for natural populations of S. mutans ofthe human oral cavity. The in vitro selection of the xylitol-resistant phenotype during consecutive periods of growth at the expense of glucose in the presence of xylitol was followed. Likewise, {{it was found that the}} average percentage of xylitol-resistant fresh isolates from two human subjects increased from 0 per cent to 78 per cent over a xylitol-consuming period of 17 d, while it increased from 0 per cent to 8 per cent only in the control subjects who were consuming sorbitol and mannitol instead of xylitol. The superiority of this method resides in the possibility of processing many samples simultaneously. Moreover, it can be applied successfully to the detection and enumeration of other types of PTS mutants if the radioactive xylitol is replaced with a sugar analogue of the defective PTS. A strain of S. salivarius, defective in mannose-PTS, was identified with 2 -deo~y-['~C]glucose...|$|R
40|$|The {{amplification}} of carboxylesterase structural genes {{followed by}} their overexpression {{is the most}} common mechanism of resistance to organophosphorus insecticides in Culex mosquitoes. Most resistant Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes have co-amplified estalpha 2 (1) and estbeta 2 (1) genes. Recently, Southern, DNA dot-blot analysis and phosphorimaging technology were used to quantify the est gene copy number in aphids and mosquitoes. Although more accurate than <b>autoradiography,</b> this <b>method</b> relies on probe hybridization, which can be variable. We have directly measured gene and mRNA copy number by using real-time quantitative PCRs in mosquitoes. The acquisition of fluorescence from incorporation of the double-strand-specific dye SYBR GreenI into a PCR product once per cycle is used to provide an absolute quantification of the initial template copy number. Thus it has been possible to show that estalpha 2 (1) and estbeta 2 (1) are co-amplified approx. 80 -fold in the genome of the resistant PelRR strain of C. quinquefasciatus. The two genes, although co-amplified in a 1 : 1 ratio, are differentially transcribed: the estbeta 2 (1) gene from this amplicon has greater transcription than estalpha 2 (1) in all individual mosquito larvae tested, with an average ratio of 10 : 1. Purified esterases from mosquito homogenates were found in a ratio of 3 : 1, which, combined with the quantitative mRNA data, suggests the operation of both transcriptional and translational control mechanisms to regulate the expression of the amplified genes in C. quinquefasciatus insecticide-resistant mosquitoes...|$|R

The effect of anticeHular antibody on cultured cells in a system free of complement varies with the concentration of antibody present. High levels of antibody agglutinate cells and interfere with growth. Lower concentrations do not interfere with growth of cells or induce morphologic changes detectable by light microscopy (3 - 5) but do block infection by certain viruses (4 [...] 7). This inhibition of virus infection by anticellular antibody suggested that the antibody might alter specific functions of the cell.

40|$|Introduction DNA {{damage is}} among the main {{consequences}} of radiation. Of many different classes of DNA damage, double-strand breaks are the most deleterious. Development of a sensitive biodosimetry method, which utilizes a detection material with a similar construction to the body, seems essential for monitoring radiation workers. In this study, histone H 2 AX protein was examined as a potential biodosimeter in radiation workers. Moreover, {{the presence of this}} protein after in vitro irradiation of blood samples was assessed simultaneously. Materials and Methods Blood samples from 46 radiation workers were analyzed in Golestan province, Iran. Meanwhile, two groups of blood samples (five blood samples in each group) were irradiated in vitro by doses of 1 to 0. 2 Gy and 0. 09 to 0. 01 Gy from a 60 Co source, respectively. γH 2 AX level in lymphocytes was measured, using Western blot technique. ANOVA and Tukey's tests were performed, using SPSS version 16. The significance level was considered to be 0. 05. Results The results of Western blotting for the identification of γH 2 AX protein in radiation workers were negative. However, γH 2 AX level in lymphocytes of two in vitro irradiated groups showed a significant correlation with the radiation dose (P< 0. 0001). Conclusion The results showed that γH 2 AX was a good indicator for acute or local exposure to ionizing radiation, while in chronically exposed individuals, including radiation workers, this protein was useless at least in <b>autoradiography</b> detection <b>method.</b> Regarding the presence of γH 2 AX protein in blood samples, which were irradiated in vitro at low doses, it can be concluded that this protein has powerful repair mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) is a {{technique}} used to assess physiological and biochemical processes under in vivo conditions. SPECT generates tomographic images from blood flow, glucose metabolism and receptor characteristics using radioactively labelled substances. This paper reviews {{the state of the}} art of in vivo imaging of laboratory animals in modified human and dedicated animal SPECT scanners. SPECT cameras with special collimators currently reach spatial resolutions up to 1 min and sensitivities of about 1000 cps/MBq, allowing observation of receptor activity concentration changes in the pico-mole range. The time resolution of such cameras strongly depends on the pharmacological behaviour of the tracer and can range from several minutes to hours. Within these limits the functional characterization of many processes is possible. SPECT also offers the possibility to set up dynamic study protocols and repeated measurements of the same animal. This technique reduces the need for sacrificing animals, as was commonly practiced before the development of animal cameras. Animal SPECT gives the opportunity to monitor physiological and biochemical processes in animals in vivo, without interfering with the system under observation, and may become a valuable adjunct to the instrumentation (<b>autoradiography,</b> in vitro <b>methods)</b> of animal research...|$|R

To determine whether absorptive cells of suckling rat ileum conduct selective transepithelial transport of EGF, we followed uptake of 125 I-EGF from ileal loops by <b>autoradiography</b> and biochemical <b>methods.</b> Specific binding sites for 125 I-EGF were localized by electron microscope autoradiography on apical membranes of ileal epithelial sheets in vitro. During uptake in vivo, radiolabeled molecules were concentrated in apical endosomal compartments and were {{also associated with}} lysosomal vacuoles, basolateral cell surfaces, and lamina propria. Excess cold EGF reduced basolateral label by 44 % and TCA precipitable serum label by 38 %. After 30 and 60 min of continuous uptake, radiolabeled molecules in epithelium, denuded mucosa, blood, and liver were analyzed under reducing conditions by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Although considerable degradation of 125 I-EGF occurred after uptake from the lumen, a portion of radiolabel in epithelium and mucosa represented 125 I-EGF which eluted somewhat more rapidly from C 18 HPLC columns and showed a slight decrease in apparent molecular weight by SDS-PAGE. All radiolabel in blood and liver represented breakdown products. Thus, EGF is selectively transported across the ileal epithelium in suckling rats but is modified during transport. Milk EGF may accumulate in the lamina propria where it could influence growth and maturation of the suckling intestine...|$|R

Although a great deal {{is known about the}} biochemical and morphological events accompanying chemotactic activation [3 - 9], there is very little morphological information about the chemoattractant receptors themselves. This latter information is needed so that we may understand the mechanism by which these inflammatory cells detect and respond to chemical gradients. One class of chemotactic factors extensively used to characterize the complex behavioral responses following leukocyte activation are the synthetic formylmethionyl peptides. These peptides, now known to be the analogs of the naturally occurring N-terminal peptides produced by bacteria [10], are released into culture medium and are believed to be responsible, at least in part, for the accumulation of leukocytes at the sites of bacterial infection [1, 2].
