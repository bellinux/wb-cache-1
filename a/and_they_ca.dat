Our information architecture was developed for juvenile justice and medical patient records, but is usable in other application domains such as personal resumes, financial histories, or customer support. Our model groups personal history events into aggregates that are contained in facets (e. g., doctor visits, hospitalizations, or lab tests). Crosslinks enable representation of arbitrary relationships across events and aggregates. Data attributes, such as severity, can be mapped by data administrators to visual attributes such as color and line thickness.

40|$|We have {{recently}} described the preparation and properties of ionically conductive Nation-impregnated Gore-tex (NIGT) composite membranes (10). In this paper, we describe lectronically conductive composite membranes prepared by electropolymerizing either pyrrole or thiophene within the ionically conductive NIGT membrane. These composites have the mechanical {{properties of the}} host membrane, yet the electronic conductivity of the NIGT/polypyrrole compos-ite membrane is essentially identical to that of polypyrrole. For comparison, we have also attempted to electro-polymerize pyrrole in Nation membranes and films and in bare Gore-tex and poly(vinyl chloride) -impregnated Gore-tex. A considerable amount of research effort is currently being devoted to studies of electronically conductive polymers (1 - 4). While a number of systems have been in-vestigated, polymers based on heterocyclic monomers (e. g., pyrrole) offer {{a number of important}} advantages (2 - 4).

40|$|SummaryThe binding {{interface}} of calmodulin and a calmodulin {{binding peptide}} were reengineered by computationally designing complementary bumps and holes. This redesign {{led to the}} development of sensitive and specific pairs of mutant proteins used to sense Ca 2 + in a second generation of genetically encoded Ca 2 + indicators (cameleons). These cameleons are no longer perturbed by large excesses of native calmodulin, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> display <b>Ca</b> 2 + sensitivities tuned over a 100 -fold range (0. 6 – 160 μM). Incorporation of circularly permuted Venus in place of Citrine results in a 3 - to 5 -fold increase in the dynamic range. These redesigned cameleons show significant improvements over previous versions in the ability to monitor Ca 2 + in the cytoplasm as well as distinct subcellular localizations, such as the plasma membrane of neurons and the mitochondria...|$|R

For instance, the Take The Best heuristic uses validity order for cues, which requires considerable computation, potentially undermining the computational advantages of the simple decision mechanism. But many cue orders can achieve good decision performance, and studies of sequential search for data records have proposed a number of simple ordering rules that may be of use in constructing appropriate decision cue orders as well.

40|$|The antigen {{receptor}} (TCR) on effector T lymphocytes {{has been characterized}} as an a # chain heterodimer {{that is associated with}} the CD 3 (T 3) complex on the cell surface (1). Recently, a second CD 3 -associated heterodimer, composed of a y gene product and a putative S gene product, has been identified on a subset of human lymphocytes (2, 3) human thymocytes (4), and murine thymocytes (5). Because # and y chain mRNA, in contrast to a chain mRNA transcripts, are abundant in immature murine thymocytes (6, 7) it was hypothesized that such thymocytes could express #y receptors that are replaced by a # receptors after translation of a chain mRNA (6, 7). However, no evidence exists that # and y protein can be synthesized by a single cell. In this report we show that the human T cell line PEER, which expresses a CD 3 associated TCR y chain on the cell surface (8, 9), synthesizes a 38 kD 0 chain product that associates intracellularly with CD 3. However, this CD 3 -TCR # complex is not found on the cell surface, presumably because no a chain protein can be synthesized (8).

On Earth, climatological and geomorphological processes continue in the Pleis-tocene period more or less like {{they did in the}} Precambrian. But Earth history is quite different because in biology — unlike physics, chemistry, geomor-phology, or astronomy — something can be learned. Once upon a time, sig-nals appeared! Where once there was matter, energy, and where these remain, there is information, symbolically encoding life. There is a new state of mat-ter, neither liquid nor gaseous nor solid, but vital. With the passing of cold and warm fronts or the uplifting and eroding of mountains, there is no natu-ral selection. Nothing is competing, nothing is surviving, reproducing, noth-ing has adapted fit. To come into being, to survive, an organism needs to gain, to use, to transmit relevant information. If we ourselves are to gain the information we wish about this generating of vital information, we need to figure out five big unknowns. Creating Information In nature, in the Newtonian view there were two metaphysical fundamentals: matter and energy. Einstein reduced these two to one: matter-energy. In mat-ter in motion, there is conservation of matter, also of energy; neither can be created nor destroyed, although each can take diverse forms, and one can be transformed into the other. In the biological sciences, the novelty is that matter-energy enters into rich information states.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the healthy}} adult brain microglia, the main immune-competent {{cells of the}} CNS, have a {{distinct}} (so-called resting or surveying) phenotype. Resting microglia can only be studied in vivo since any isolation of brain tissue inevitably triggers microglial activation. Here we used in vivo two-photon imaging to obtain a first insight into Ca 2 + signaling in resting cortical microglia. The majority (80 %) of microglial cells showed no spontaneous Ca 2 + transients at rest and in conditions of strong neuronal activity. However, they reliably responded with large, generalized Ca 2 + transients to damage of an individual neuron. These damage-induced responses had a short latency (0. 4 – 4 s) and were localized to the immediate vicinity of the damaged neuron (< 50 μm cell body-to-cell body distance). They were occluded by the application of ATPγS as well as UDP and 2 -MeSADP, the agonists of metabotropic P 2 Y receptors, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> required <b>Ca</b> 2 + release from the intracellular Ca 2 + stores. Thus, our in vivo data suggest that microglial Ca 2 + signals occur mostly under pathological conditions and identify a Ca 2 + store-operated signal, which represents a very sensitive, rapid, and highly localized response of microglial cells to brain damage.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that kisspeptin regulates reproduction via stimulation of hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion, which then induces pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) release. Kisspeptin also directly stimulates pituitary hormone release in some mammals. However, in goldfish, whether kisspeptin directly affects pituitary hormone release is controversial. In this study, synthetic goldfish kisspeptin- 1 (1 - 10) (gKiss 1) enhances LH and growth hormone (GH) release from primary cultures of goldfish pituitary cells in column perifusion. gKiss 1 stimulation of LH and GH secretion were still manifested {{in the presence of}} the two native goldfish GnRHs, salmon (s) GnRH (goldfish GnRH- 3) and chicken (c) GnRH-II (goldfish GnRH- 2), but were attenuated by two voltage-sensitive calcium channel blockers, verapamil and nifedipine. gKiss-induced increases in intracellular Ca 2 + in Fura- 2 AM pre-loaded goldfish pars distalis cells were also inhibited by nifedipine.

In this study, we demonstrate an essential role for protein–tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) – 1 B in this process. In resting platelets, c-Src forms a complex with αIIbβ 3 and Csk, which phosphorylates c-Src tyrosine 529 to maintain c-Src autoinhibition. Fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ 3 triggers PTP- 1 B recruitment to the αIIbβ 3 –c-Src–Csk complex {{in a manner that}} is dependent on c-Src and specific tyrosine (tyrosine 152 and 153) and proline (proline 309 and 310) residues in PTP- 1 B.

40|$|There is {{controversy}} over whether Ca 2 + binds to the BKCa channel's intracellular domain or its integral-membrane domain and {{over whether or}} not mutations that reduce the channel's Ca 2 + sensitivity act at the point of Ca 2 + coordination. One region in the intracellular domain that has been implicated in Ca 2 + sensing is the “Ca 2 + bowl”. This region contains many acidic residues, and large Ca 2 +-bowl mutations eliminate Ca 2 + sensing through what appears to be one type of high-affinity Ca 2 +-binding site. Here, through site-directed mutagenesis we have mapped the residues in the Ca 2 + bowl that are most important for Ca 2 + sensing. We find acidic residues, D 898 and D 900, to be essential, and we find them essential as well for Ca 2 + binding to a fusion protein that contains a portion of the BKCa channel's intracellular domain.

40|$|Evidence has {{accumulated}} {{in support of}} a role for intracellularly generated inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate [Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3] in raising cytosol [Ca 2 +] when various hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors and other stimulants act on cell surfaces. The increase in [Ca 2 +] that follows stimulant-receptor interaction is accompanied by rapid hydrolysis of phosphoinositides. One product, Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3, arising from the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate was shown to promote the release of Ca 2 + from non-mitochondrial stores in a variety of cells. Although platelet intracellular membranes have been implicated in the control of cytosol [Ca 2 +] and we previously characterized a Ca 2 +-sequestering mechanism associated with them, we have as yet no knowledge of how this Ca 2 + store is mobilized after a stimulus-receptor interaction at the platelet surface. Using free-flow electrophoresis, we isolated and purified human platelet intracellular membranes. They show high enrichment and exclusive localization of the endoplasmic-reticulum marker NADH:cytochrome c reductase, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> sequester <b>Ca</b> 2 + by an ATP-dependent process, reaching steady-state values in 10 - 12 min. Saturation with Ca 2 + occurs at around 10 - 30 microM external Ca 2 +. When Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 is added to the 45 Ca-loaded vesicles, a rapid release of Ca 2 + occurs (approx. 35 % in 15 - 30 s). The magnitude of the release depends upon external [Ca 2 +], being maximum in the range 0. 3 - 0. 8 microM and low at external [Ca 2 +] greater than 1 microM. After release there is a rapid re-uptake of Ca 2 +, with restoration of the former steady-state values within 1 min. Half-maximal release occurs at approx. 0. 25 microM-Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3. This release and re-uptake pattern is not observed with ionophore A 23187 or arachidonic acid, both of which liberate Ca 2 + irreversibly. Inositol 1, 4 -bisphosphate was ineffective in releasing Ca 2 + from these intracellular membranes. The results support the role of Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 as a specific intracellular mediator, transducing the action of excitatory agonists acting on the platelet surface into metabolic, mechanochemical and other functional events, known to occur during platelet activation...|$|R
