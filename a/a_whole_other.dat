25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why {{do you have to}} adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>other</b> world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E

500|$|After Mars {{was dropped}} by the label {{less than a year}} after being signed, he stayed in Los Angeles and landed a music {{publishing}} deal in 2005 with Steve Lindsey and Cameron Strang at Westside Independent. [...] Lindsey showed Mars and Jeff Bhasker (who Mars met through Mike Lynn) the ins and outs of writing pop music, and acted as a mentor helping them to hone their craft. Bhasker explained that Lindsey would [...] "mentor us, and kind of give us lectures as to what a hit pop song is, because you can have talent and music ability, but understanding what makes a hit pop song is <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>other</b> discipline."

[...] In 2010, following the success of [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] and the duo's musical chemistry, Guetta was asked to work on Rowland's third studio album.

Dowd started the mixing process for Eat a Peach but had run overtime and was called to commitments with Crosby, Stills and Nash; longtime Allman friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin took over for the remaining mixes. Sandlin later said of the mixing process, [...] "As I mixed songs like [...] "Blue Sky," [...] I knew, of course, that I was listening to the last things that Duane ever played and there was just such a mix of beauty and sadness, knowing there's {{not going to be any}} more from him".

500|$|Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissent, {{with which}} Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer joined. Justice David Souter joined all {{sections}} of Stevens' dissent besides {{a critique of}} previous decision of the Supreme Court in arbitration case law. Stevens examined the history of arbitration {{and the purpose of}} it throughout the century. The Federal Arbitration Act was designed, he explained, to maintain the enforceability of contractual agreements. But private arbitration is <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>other</b> situation. Stevens wrote, [...] "As the history of the legislation indicates, the potential disparity in bargaining power between individual employees and large employers was the source of organized labor’s opposition to the Act, which it feared would require courts to enforce unfair employment contracts". He went on to quote the former Chief Justice of the Israeli Supreme Court, Aharon Barak in supporting the idea that the Court should look at the purpose of the act rather than its pure statutory language.|$|E

After sharing his work with the team, he was particularly impressed by Froese's contributions. [...] "Edgar evolved the music, made it into <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>other</b> thing", Jackson said. Froese had interpolated funk sounds with Jackson’s hip-hop influences. Froese and Jackson then sent their work between The Alchemist and Oh No, who heavily sampled it. The Alchemist opined, [...] "We were sampling, taking a piece form here, a piece from there...We pitched stuff up, chopped it, tweaked it. Then we chose the tracks that worked and everyone came in and layered on that". DJ Shadow then mixed the team's creations together and matched it to the gameplay.

40|$|This article {{examines}} whether regulatory announcements relating to competition, pricing {{policy and the}} quality of service in the water industry in England and Wales {{have an impact on the}} industry's systematic risk. The results indicate that, although the long-run overall effect of regulation on systematic risk appears to be negligible, competition and quality announcements can have a significant impact upon the industry's systematic risk. Further analysis of individual announcements and companies suggests that price announcements also significantly affect individual companies' systematic risk, although not in a uniform manner. This indicates that regulators need to be aware that, while some of their policy decisions tend to affect the industry as <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> <b>others</b> have <b>a</b> diverse impact on individual companies. ...|$|R

[...] She commented {{that she would have}} loved to have seen Whitney Houston appear in the show, explaining: [...] "I think it would've been different in a sense because she's an original diva. She would've brought <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>other</b> energy, which would've been amazing." [...] Comparing her character Grace to McKinley High glee director Will, Eve explained: [...] "For me especially, I come from a harder place. I'm the teacher of a reform school.

500|$|Fraser McAlpine from BBC complimented {{the song}} and Kesha for knowing her way around a strong pop chorus, giving the single {{four out of five}} stars. McAlpine noted that [...] "some {{evidence}} of range would be welcomed at this point, [...] there's <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>other</b> side to her that you'd never know if you just listened to the singles" [...] commenting that her persona was the [...] "boozy floozy card" [...] and that the power ballads on her album could have been better for a release. He went on to conclude [...] "even though her 'act' is to be far too revealing about her dirty habits, she has still managed to create something of a mystique cloud around herself". Billboard magazine's Monica Herrera was impressed with the song, calling it [...] "blissful". She went on to compliment the song for its strong chorus that has the ability to [...] "stick with the listener for days". Sara Anderson of AOL Radio called the song [...] "a playful take on a teen love obsession", complimenting [...] "Kesha's signature auto-tuned vocals and casual chatty ad-libs". Anderson commented on the chorus of the song calling it [...] "a modern Cyndi Lauper-inspired chorus". Nate Adams of No Ripcord was positive in his review of the song, calling it [...] "a fun little disco tune", and wrote that the singer [...] "isn't reinventing the wheel {{by any stretch of the}} imagination, but she has her share of catchy would-be hits." ...|$|E
500|$|Charlotte's {{discovery}} of a polar bear with a Dharma Initiative collar caused fan speculation about her connection with the island. Mader herself was unaware of Charlotte's backstory beyond the flashback in [...] "Confirmed Dead"she noted [...] "I feel like I'm almost in the same seat as the audience, like 'What {{the hell is going}} on?' and 'What the hell is going to happen next?', it's really exciting actually". She found it freeing to not know her character's history, and felt it made her give a natural performance. Mader felt Charlotte's relationship with Faraday allowed her character to develop and show a softer, more human side, and thought their relationship resonated with the audience as she and Jeremy Davies had good chemistry. Eight episodes of season four were written before production stopped due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. Once the strike was resolved, a further six episodes were written, two less than originally planned for the season, and as a result Charlotte's role continued into season five. She enjoyed speaking Korean in [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] and wished the full scene had been aired. Mader was excited when she discovered that Charlotte grew up on the island, and hoped to have scenes with Nestor Carbonell who plays Richard Alpert, as his character also has a history on the island. However when negotiating contracts in June 2008 she found out that her character would die during season five; Mader summed up Charlotte's season five arc as her demise. Charlotte's death scene was written by Eddy Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and was amongst their favourite scenes they wrote during season five. Horowitz loved the emotion in the scene due to the audience only just learning Charlotte's backstory, and Kitsis thought Mader's performance [...] "elevate the words to <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>other</b> level". Mader called it [...] "the best thing [...] ha ever done in [...] entire career" [...] and enjoyed playing a significant role within the episode.|$|E
