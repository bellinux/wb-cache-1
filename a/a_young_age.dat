30|$|The {{frequency}} of breast cancers {{at less than}} 30  years of age is approximately 1 % of all breast cancers, and <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> {{has been reported to}} have a worse prognosis among premenopausal as well as all breast cancer patients (Maggard et al. 2003; Cancello et al. 2010). However, the recent recommendation of St. Gallen excluded <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> as prognostic factor (Glick et al. 1992; Goldhirsch et al. 2001, 2009; Colleoni et al. 2006), and we previously reported that the prognosis of PABC is correlated with <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> (Makita et al. 2007). In this study, <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> was not found to be an independent prognostic factor, although recent childbirth probably influenced the prognosis of the younger than 30 breast cancer patients by lowering their hormonal sensitivity. In addition, the prognosis of PABC and very young breast cancer patients can be explained by considering the interval from the last childbirth (Johansson et al. 2013).|$|R

40|$|Background The {{onset of}} {{secondary}} progression is a pivotal {{event in the}} course of relapsingeremitting (RR) multiple sclerosis (MS). Patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS) experience continuous worsening of symptoms independent of the occurrence of relapses. Possible risk factors associated with the onset of SPMS remain under investigated in natural history studies of MS disease course. Methods We used KaplaneMeier survival analyses and Cox regression models to investigate the influence of gender, onset age and onset symptoms on time to and age at SPMS in British Columbia (BC) MS patients with a RR disease onset who were not exposed to immunomodulatory drugs. Results Of 5778 patients in the BCMS database with definite MS, 5207 (90 %) had an RR onset. Median time to SPMS was 21. 4 years (95 % CI 20. 6 to 22. 2), reached at a median age of 53. 7 years (95 % CI 53. 1 to 54. 3). Male gender and motor onset symptoms were associated with a shorter time to and <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> at SPMS. <b>A</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> at disease onset was associated with a longer time to SPMS but also with <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> at secondary progression. Other onset symptoms were not associated with time to, or age at, SPMS. Conclusions We identified three factors influencing the onset of SPMS in untreated patients with RRMS: motor onset symptoms and male gender were associated with both a shorter time to and <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> at SPMS. <b>A</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> at disease onset should not be viewed as indicating a better prognosis...|$|R

40|$|Cosmetic {{treatment}} with botulinum toxin type A injections {{is the top}} non-surgical cosmetic procedure in the U. S. Many patients are beginning treatment at <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> to prevent the development of facial wrinkles associated with aging. However, there is limited data to {{support the use of}} prophylactic botulinum toxin injections. Patients beginning treatment at <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> have fewer wrinkles requiring fewer units to treat, which reduces the overall cost of treatment. Patients also maintain higher levels of self- esteem by preventing or delaying the onset of facial wrinkles that can negatively impact their appearance. This study proposes that patients receiving botulinum toxin injections at <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>age</b> (< 35) will have higher satisfaction with treatment outcomes. By demonstrating an association between starting age of injections and patient satisfaction, this study aims to provide merit for clinical trials studying the effectiveness of prophylactic botulinum toxin injections for cosmetic indications...|$|R
