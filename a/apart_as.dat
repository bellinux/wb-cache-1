5|$|In Fáfnismál, {{the dying}} wyrm Fafnir tells the hero Sigurd that, during {{the events of}} Ragnarok, bearing spears, gods will meet at Óskópnir. From there, the gods will cross Bilröst, which will break <b>apart</b> <b>as</b> they cross over it, causing their horses to dredge through an immense river.|$|E
5|$|The event {{appears to}} have {{affected}} all continents at the same time. Non-avian dinosaurs, for example, are known from the Maastrichtian of North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, and Antarctica, but are unknown from the Cenozoic anywhere in the world. Similarly, fossil pollen shows devastation of the plant communities in areas as far <b>apart</b> <b>as</b> New Mexico, Alaska, China, and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|They also {{compare the}} {{possibility}} of extending property rights to animals to the approach of European colonists, who were prepared to extend property, but not sovereignty, rights to native peoples, resulting in oppression. Hadley, however, is himself critical of Donaldson and Kymlicka's sovereignty proposal, though the British philosopher Josh Milburn suggests that the proposals {{may not be as}} far <b>apart</b> <b>as</b> the authors indicate.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of Modern Times, Chaplin left with Goddard {{for a trip to}} the Far East. The couple had refused to comment on the nature of their relationship, and it was not known whether they were married or not. Some time later, Chaplin {{revealed}} that they married in Canton during this trip. By 1938, the couple had drifted <b>apart,</b> <b>as</b> both focused heavily on their work, although Goddard was again his leading lady in his next feature film, The Great Dictator. She eventually divorced Chaplin in Mexico in 1942, citing incompatibility and separation for more than a year.|$|E
5|$|From {{the point}} of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing processes in dynamic systems. From {{the point of}} view of chemistry, a spiral can be generated by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far <b>apart</b> <b>as</b> possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, Anna Eliza Corwin {{divorced}} Brannan. They {{had grown}} <b>apart</b> <b>as</b> Eliza lived in Europe {{for quite some}} time while Brannan remained in California. Because of the divorce he lost much of his personal fortune, as it was ruled that his wife was entitled to half of their holdings, payable in cash. Because the vast majority of Brannan's holdings were in real estate, he had to liquidate the properties to pay the full divorce settlement.|$|E

5|$|In April 1941, Yugoslavia was {{occupied}} by Nazi Germany and Italy, the latter annexing or occupying the Croatian Littoral, although the armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces of World War II and the 1947 Treaty of Peace with Italy reversed wartime Italian territorial gains, awarding the entire region and adjacent territory to Yugoslavia and the Federal State of Croatia. After the fall of communism, Yugoslavia broke <b>apart</b> <b>as</b> Slovenia and Croatia declared independence in 1991. Although the region suffered an economic decline during the Croatian War of Independence, there was no fighting in the region.|$|E
5|$|Lambeosaurus, {{best known}} through L. lambei, was {{quite similar to}} Corythosaurus in {{everything}} but {{the form of the}} head adornment. Compared to Corythosaurus, the crest of Lambeosaurus was shifted forward, and the hollow nasal passages within were {{at the front of the}} crest and stacked vertically. It also can be differentiated from Corythosaurus by its lack of forking nasal processes making up part of the sides of the crest, which is the only way to tell juveniles of the two genera <b>apart,</b> <b>as</b> the crests took on their distinctive forms as the animals aged.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Army's command {{structure}} fell <b>apart</b> <b>as</b> Bagration was evacuated {{from the battlefield}} and the report of him being hit quickly spread and caused morale collapse. Napoleon, who had been sick with a cold and was {{too far from the}} action to really observe what was going on, refused to send his subordinates reinforcements. He was hesitant to release his last reserve, the Imperial Guard, so far from France.|$|E

5|$|The {{two main}} {{parts of the}} wreck of Titanic present a {{striking}} contrast. Although fourteen survivors testified that the ship had broken <b>apart</b> <b>as</b> she sank, this testimony was discounted by the official inquiries, and it was supposed that the ship had sunk intact. It {{is now clear that}} the stresses on Titanic caused the ship to split apart between the second and third funnels at or just below the surface.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two basic}} {{aerodynamic}} models of insect flight. Most insects use a method that creates a spiralling leading edge vortex. Some very small insects use the fling and clap or Weis-Fogh mechanism in which the wings clap together above the insect's body and then fling <b>apart.</b> <b>As</b> they fling open, the air gets sucked in and creates a vortex over each wing. This bound vortex then moves across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the starting vortex for the other wing. Circulation and lift are increased, {{at the price of}} wear and tear on the wings.|$|E
5|$|Weisman {{explains}} that a common house {{would begin to}} fall <b>apart</b> <b>as</b> water eventually leaks into the roof around the flashings, erodes the wood and rusts the nails, leading to sagging walls and eventual collapse. After 500 years, all that would be left would be aluminum dishwasher parts, stainless steel cookware, and plastic handles. The longest-lasting evidence on Earth of a human presence would be radioactive materials, ceramics, bronze statues, and Mount Rushmore. In space, the Pioneer plaques, the Voyager Golden Record, and radio waves would outlast the Earth itself.|$|E

5|$|According to Herodotus, {{both sides}} wished for a decisive battle that would tip {{the war in}} their favor. However, Lazenby {{believed}} that Mardonius' actions during the Plataea campaign were not consistent with an aggressive policy. He interprets the Persian operations during the prelude not as attempts to force the Allies into battle but as attempts to force the Allies into retreat (which indeed became the case). Mardonius may have felt he had little to gain in battle {{and that he could}} simply wait for the Greek alliance to fall <b>apart</b> (<b>as</b> it had nearly done over the winter). There can be little doubt from Herodotus' account that Mardonius was prepared to accept battle on his own terms, however. Regardless of the exact motives, the initial strategic situation allowed both sides to procrastinate, since food supplies were ample for both armies. Under these conditions, the tactical considerations outweighed the strategic need for action.|$|E
5|$|After {{years in}} the tag team division, Hardy took on The Undertaker in a ladder match for the WWE Undisputed Championship. Hardy came up short in the intense match, but earned The Undertaker's respect when he {{displayed}} courage by attempting to rise to his feet after the bout and challenge The Undertaker to continue. Hardy competed for singles titles on several occasions and defeated William Regal for the European Championship. Hardy was defeated {{a few weeks later}} by Rob Van Dam in a ladder match to unify the European Championship and the Intercontinental Championship, and the European Championship was retired. Finally, the Hardy Boyz split <b>apart,</b> <b>as</b> Hardy continued to pursue his singles ambitions on Raw and his brother, Matt left Raw for his own singles pursuits signing with Stephanie McMahon's SmackDown! brand. On Raw, Hardy would compete in WWE's Hardcore division until the title's unification with the Intercontinental Championship.|$|E

5|$|As landholders and drafted {{government}} officials, the gentry {{considered themselves}} the leading members of society; gaining their cooperation and employment was {{essential for the}} county or provincial bureaucrat overburdened with official duties. In many ways, scholar-officials of the Song period differed from the more aristocratic scholar-officials of the Tang dynasty (618–907). Civil service examinations became the primary means of appointment to an official post as competitors vying for official degrees dramatically increased. Frequent disagreements amongst ministers of state on ideological and policy issues led to political strife {{and the rise of}} political factions. This undermined the marriage strategies of the professional elite, which broke <b>apart</b> <b>as</b> a social group and gave way to a multitude of families which provided sons for civil service.|$|E
5|$|During the {{turbulent}} {{era of the}} Civil Wars and the incorporation of Scotland into a Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland, significant building in Scotland was largely confined to military architecture. Polygonal fortresses with triangular bastions {{in the style of}} the trace italienne were built to house English soldiers at Ayr, Perth and Leith, and 20 smaller forts were built as far <b>apart</b> <b>as</b> Orkney and Stornoway. Control of the Highlands was secured by new strongpoints at Inverlocky and Inverness. The universities saw an improvement in their funding, as they were given income from deaneries, defunct bishoprics and the excise, allowing the completion of buildings including the college in the High Street in Glasgow. After the Restoration in 1660, large-scale building began again, influenced by a growing interest in Classicism.|$|E
5|$|Harry has {{a vision}} {{involving}} an attack upon Arthur Weasley, {{from the point}} of view of Arthur's attacker. Concerned that Voldemort will exploit this connection to Harry, Dumbledore instructs Severus Snape to give Harry Occlumency lessons to defend his mind from Voldemort's influence. The connection between Harry and Voldemort leads Harry to further isolate himself from his friends. Meanwhile, Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius's deranged Death Eater cousin, escapes from Azkaban along with nine other Death Eaters. At Hogwarts, Umbridge and her Inquisitorial Squad expose Dumbledore's Army. Dumbledore escapes as Fudge orders his arrest. Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress. Harry's relationship with Cho falls <b>apart,</b> <b>as</b> he believes she betrayed them to Umbridge. Harry discovers through Snape's memories why Snape disliked Harry's father James, who often bullied him.|$|E
