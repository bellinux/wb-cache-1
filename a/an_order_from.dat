5|$|As {{had been}} made clear several times {{before and during the}} trial, Lamb's court victory did not make him a free man. He was escorted by police back to Penetanguishene and placed in the hospital's maximum {{security}} unit at Oak Ridge, where he was to remain indefinitely pending <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>from</b> the Ontario Executive Council.|$|E
5|$|The {{intercepts}} even included <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>from</b> Trotsky to {{the revolutionary}} council of {{war of the}} Western Front, confirming Tukhachevsky's operational orders, thus giving them {{the authority of the}} supreme chief of the Soviet armed forces. An entire operational order from Tukhachevsky to Budionny was intercepted on 19 August and read on 20 August, stating the tasks of all of Tukhachevsky's armies, of which only the essence had previously been known.|$|E
5|$|A second I-215 {{was built}} to <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>from</b> OKB-1 as the I-215D (dooblyor, second prototype), to {{evaluate}} the bicycle or tandem landing gear configuration. It used wider-diameter paired wheels in a tandem arrangement that retracted into the fuselage, along with small outrigger wheels under the engine nacelles which retracted into fairings. The main undercarriage of the I-215D also incorporated a kneeling feature which could increase the incidence of the aircraft by 3° to assist take-off. Trials with this undercarriage arrangement were successful and {{paved the way for}} its use in other Soviet aircraft, including Dr. Brunolf Baade's Aircraft 150, then under development.|$|E

5|$|Both {{halves of}} the road trace their origins to {{the early days of}} Aspen's {{settlement}} in the 1880s during the Colorado Silver Boom. Prospectors who had missed out on the earlier mining boom that built Leadville began to head west, drawn by reports of vast untapped silver deposits in the Roaring Fork Valley just beyond the Continental Divide. They began crossing what was then known as Hunter Pass, in defiance of <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>from</b> Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin not to do so until the federal government had negotiated a peace treaty with the Ute people.|$|E
5|$|Hearing gunfire in the distance, Hinton, {{wanting to}} assist in the defence of the Allied positions, went to the {{headquarters}} of Brigadier Leonard Parrington, the officer in command of the evacuation. Hinton vehemently protested, in strong language, <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>from</b> Parrington to surrender. On being threatened with a court-martial for speaking to a senior officer in such a manner, he issued his own threat of proceedings against Parrington for defeatist talk and then left to determine for himself the situation. Other men of the reinforcement battalion were making preparations to move into the town and face the Germans. In the meantime, Hinton had collected his own party of 12 soldiers and led them into the town but came under fire. Ignoring <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>from</b> a nearby officer to retreat, he rushed forward to the nearest enemy gun and, hurling two grenades, killed the crew. He continued towards the town's waterfront, clearing out two light machine-gun nests and a mortar with grenades, then dealt with the garrison of a house where some of the enemy were sheltering. He then assisted in the capture of an artillery piece, but shortly after was shot in the stomach, immobilised and captured, one of about 6,000 Allied soldiers made a prisoner of war (POW).|$|E
5|$|In January 1993, {{following}} <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>from</b> UPS Airlines, Boeing {{launched a}} freighter variant, the 767-300F, which entered service with UPS on October 16, 1995. The 767-300F featured a main deck cargo hold, upgraded landing gear, and strengthened wing structure. In November 1993, the Japanese government launched the first 767 military derivative when it placed {{orders for the}} , an Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) variant based on the 767-200ER. The first two , featuring extensive modifications to accommodate surveillance radar and other monitoring equipment, were delivered in 1998 to the Japan Self-Defense Forces.|$|E

5|$|In early 1973, {{with the}} ransom money still missing, The Oregon Journal republished the serial numbers and offered $1,000 {{to the first}} person to turn in a ransom bill to the {{newspaper}} or any FBI field office. In Seattle, the Post-Intelligencer made a similar offer with a $5,000 reward. The offers remained in effect until Thanksgiving 1974, and though there were several near-matches, no genuine bills were found. In 1975 Northwest Orient's insurer, Global Indemnity Co., complied with <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>from</b> the Minnesota Supreme Court and paid the airline's $180,000 claim on the ransom money.|$|E
5|$|Lee spent $50,000 in {{personal}} savings {{to demonstrate the}} cables at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Chicago in 1979, using a borrowed portion of someone else's exhibit area. Lee received a positive response at the event and founded Monster, Inc. (formerly known as Monster Cable Products) later that year. Lee received <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>from</b> a Canadian distributor for 30,000 cables. The distributor wouldn't pay until the products were shipped, so Lee took out a $250,000 bank loan {{to pay for the}} production of the cables. According to Lee, he started the company without business experience or a strategy.|$|E

5|$|Welsh raids at the {{beginning}} of Stephen's reign had driven Bethune's former canons from Llanthony and the bishop gave them refuge at Hereford before establishing them at a new site near Gloucester. The land the canons were settled on had belonged to the diocese, and this led Bethune into conflict with his cathedral chapter, led by their dean, Ralph. Bethune was forced to travel to Pisa to secure <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>from</b> Innocent II declaring that the chapter obey their bishop.|$|E
5|$|At midday on 16 August, von Kluge {{had refused}} <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>from</b> Hitler for another counter-attack, {{and in the}} {{afternoon}} Hitler agreed to a withdrawal but became suspicious that von Kluge intended to surrender to the Allies. Late on 17 August, Hitler sacked von Kluge and recalled him to Germany; von Kluge then either killed himself or was executed by SS-officer Jürgen Stroop for {{his involvement in the}} 20 July plot. Von Kluge was succeeded by Field Marshal Walter Model, whose first act was to order the immediate retreat of the 7th Army and Fifth Panzer Army, while the II SS Panzer Corps—with the remnants of four Panzer divisions—held the north face of the escape route against the British and Canadians, and the XLVII Panzer Corps—with what was left of two Panzer divisions—held the southern face against the Third US Army.|$|E

5|$|In June 1987, as {{a private}} venture, BAe, McDonnell Douglas, and Smiths Industries signed an MoU for the {{development}} of what was to become the AV-8B Plus, which saw the addition of radar and increased missile compatibility. The agreement was endorsed by the USMC and, after much consideration, the Spanish and Italian navies developed a joint requirement for a fleet of air-defense Harriers. The United States, Spain, and Italy signed an MoU in September 1990 to define the responsibilities of the three countries and establish a Joint Program Office to manage the program. On 30 November 1990, the USN, acting as an agent for the three participating countries, awarded McDonnell Douglas the contract to develop the improved Harrier. The award was followed by <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>from</b> the USMC in December 1990 for 30 new aircraft, and 72 rebuilt from older aircraft. Italy ordered 16 Harrier II Plus and two twin-seat TAV-8B aircraft, while Spain signed a contract for eight aircraft. Production of the AV-8B Harrier II Plus was conducted, in addition to McDonnell Douglas' plant, at CASA's facility in Seville, Spain, and Alenia Aeronautica's facility in Turin, Italy. The UK also participated in the program by manufacturing components for the AV-8B.|$|E
5|$|On 8 November, Davorin Rudolf {{representing}} Croatian authorities, and Lieutenant Colonel General Marijan ČadJNA {{commanding officer}} of the 13th (Rijeka) Corpsagreed to evacuate the corps personnel and equipment from Croatia. The agreement, made after negotiations supervised {{and supported by the}} European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM) would later {{serve as a model for}} similar agreements elsewhere in Croatia. Čad made the agreement at his own initiative, with the support of the JNA Fifth Military District, after receiving <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>from</b> the JNA Chief of Staff Colonel General Blagoje Adžić to destroy the JNA facilities in Rijeka and to attack industrial plants and infrastructure in or near the city. The agreement was not affected by the HV capture of the Draga barracks and weapons stored there on 9 November. The JNA 13th (Rijeka) Corps started to evacuate by sea to Montenegrin ports on 18 November.|$|E
5|$|Saeed {{participated in}} the 1982 Gulf Cup of Nations in Abu Dhabi, scoring {{a total of five}} goals in the tournament: one against Oman, two against Bahrain, one against Saudi Arabia, and a last one against the UAE. Although Iraq {{finished}} 1st in the table, they withdrew from the competition by <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>from</b> Former President Saddam Hussein to motivate Kuwait who qualified to the 1982 FIFA World Cup by letting them win which led to scratching all of Iraq's results from the competition. In the same year, Saeed led Iraq to win their first ever gold medal in the Asian Games in the 1982 Asian Games, under the management of Ammo Baba, in New Delhi. In Iraq's first match, Saeed scored a goal in an easy 4–0 win over Burma. He also scored two goals in Iraq's 3–0 win against Nepal. In the quarterfinal, Iraq won over Japan with a single goal in extra time from Emad Jassim and, in the semifinal, they defeated Saudi Arabia with one goal. On 3 December, the final match was played between Iraq and Kuwait, where Saeed gained Iraq's gold medal when he scored the winning goal in the 82nd minute of the match with a through pass from Karim Mohammed Allawi.|$|E

5|$|The Finnish State Railways (VR) ordered five {{units in}} 1959, {{but these were}} {{cancelled}} for political reasons. The units were offered to NSB for a reduced price. Three were designated Di 3b {{because they had a}} slight specification variation, with a (A1A)'(A1A)' wheel arrangement and higher top speed. Two units had come short enough in the production process that they could be given the same specifications as the other Di 3a units, but received a slightly longer body. The Di 3b were given the numbers 641–643. For part of 1960, no. 623 was leased by NOHAB and sent on a demonstration tour in Eastern Europe. This resulted in <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>from</b> the Hungarian State Railways, where it became the MAV M61. The Røros Line was upgraded and the Bergen Line units transferred to Trondheim in 1960, but increased need for hauling forced NSB to not use the units on the Røros Line until the delivery of the next batch of six units in 1965. The final delivery, of four units, was made in 1969.|$|E
5|$|The nine Fiat G.50bis fighters {{took off}} from Turin-Fiat Aviazione on 12 June 1942, but before {{crossing}} the border they were stopped by <b>an</b> <b>order</b> <b>from</b> Capo di Stato Maggiore Cavallero, that was afraid the ZNDH pilots could defect with the new Fiat aircraft. The G.50 aircraft {{had to wait until}} 25 June before being delivered to the 16th Squadron at Banja Luka, but during the course of 1942, five were transferred to the 1st Squadron stationed in Zagreb in order to strengthen the defence of the NDH capital. Their deployment between the two squadrons was aimed to further familiarise the ZNDH fighter pilots with more sophisticated aircraft. Until that time, the only fighters available in numbers were the seven ancient Avia BH-33E biplanes and four Ikarus IK-2 gull wing fighters (for which there were very few spares), as well as 11 Rogožarski R-100 parasol wing fighter-trainers.|$|E
