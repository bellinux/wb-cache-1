5|$|The Premier League sells its {{television}} {{rights on}} a collective basis. This {{is in contrast}} to some other European Leagues, including La Liga, in which each club sells its rights individually, leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs. The money is divided into three parts: half is divided equally between the clubs; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position, the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club, and equal steps <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> table; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television, with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this. The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs.|$|E
25|$|In Vienna, Boltzmann taught {{physics and}} also lectured on {{philosophy}}. Boltzmann's lectures on natural philosophy were very popular and received considerable attention. His first lecture {{was an enormous}} success. Even though the largest lecture hall had been chosen for it, the people stood <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> staircase. Because of the great successes of Boltzmann's philosophical lectures, the Emperor invited him for a reception at the Palace.|$|E

One piece is wound skirt-like around {{the lower half}} of the body; the other is thrown loosely over one shoulder. The Qahtani sheep herders in the Southern Asir provence wear ankle-length skirt-like kilts. In Yemen standard dress is a calf-length, wraparound skirt, the futah. The Palestinians of the Eastern Mediterranean traditionally wear the qumbaz, an ankle-length unisex garment, which opens <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> front with the right side brought over the left, under the arm, and then fastened.|$|E

25|$|The first European {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} what became Lycoming County after the Province of Pennsylvania purchased {{the land from}} the Iroquois in the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix. Small scale sawmills along tributaries of the West Branch Susquehanna River were built prior to the American Revolution, and provided enough lumber to build the houses and barns of Williamsport and the surrounding area. Even more timber was made into rafts and floated <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Susquehanna River, into Chesapeake Bay and on to Baltimore, where the massive and straight timbers were turned into masts for the famous Baltimore Clippers and other sailing vessels of the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|In Cumbria the M6 runs <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> east of {{the county}} {{connecting}} the very north of England to the Lancashire border. The A590 links Barrow-in-Furness to Kendal with around 14,000 vehicles per day. The A595 runs all the way along the West Cumbrian coast beginning near Barrow and ending in Carlisle, linking towns such as Whitehaven and Workington. The A591 road runs from Kendal to {{the centre of the}} county connecting Lake District settlements like Windermere, Ambleside and Keswick. Other important A-roads include the A5092, A66, A596 and formerly the A74, until this was upgraded to motorway standard {{as an extension of the}} M6 between 2006 and 2008 to meet the A74(M) at the Scottish border.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the current}} rules, {{in the event}} of more than one country scoring the same total number of points, a count is made of the numbers of {{countries}} who awarded points to each of the tied countries, and the one who received points from the most countries is declared the winner. If the numbers are still tied, it is counted how many sets of maximum points (12 points) each country received. If there is still a tie, the numbers of 10-point scores awarded are compared—and then the numbers of 8-point scores, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> list. In the extremely unlikely event of there then still being a tie for first place, the song performed earliest in the running order is declared the winner, unless the host country performed first in the running order. Since 2008, the same tie-break rule now applies to ties for all places.|$|E

25|$|The pipe {{band of the}} 51st Highland Brigade played {{outside the}} stadium for the hour before he ran. The 400 metres had been {{considered}} a middle-distance event in which runners raced round the first bend and coasted through the back leg. Inspired by the Biblical message, and deprived of {{a view of the}} other runners because he drew the outside lane, Liddell raced the whole of the first 200 metres to be well clear of the favoured Americans. With little option but to then treat the race as a complete sprint, he continued to race round the final bend. He was challenged <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> home straight but held on to take the win. He broke the Olympic and world records with a time of 47.6 seconds. It was controversially ratified as a world record, despite it being 0.2 seconds slower than the record for the greater distance of 440 yards.|$|E
25|$|Over his cassock the Pope {{will wear}} a lace rochet. Over the rochet is worn the red Papal mozzetta, a {{shoulder}} cape {{that has a}} collar and is buttoned <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> front. The red color is a vestige {{from the days when}} scarlet was the Papal color (white only became associated with the papacy after the Napoleonic wars). The Papal mozzetta had a small hood on the back, which disappeared after Vatican II but has recently been restored. In wintertime, the Papal mozzetta is of red velvet trimmed with ermine (this also fell out of use after Vatican II, but Pope Benedict XVI began again to wear a winter mozzetta trimmed in ermine fur). In summer, the Papal mozzetta is of red satin. The Pope wears a pectoral cross suspended on a gold cord over the mozzetta. He may also choose to wear a red stole with gold embroidery over the mozzetta, even when he is not officiating at a service.|$|E
25|$|Another anomaly is {{that the}} short overall length means {{that there are two}} sets of pits, which also {{prevents}} a garage from being built due to limited space. Until 2002, slower starters were relegated to those on the backstretch. That year, the rules were changed to form essentially one long pit road. Thus, Bristol has unique rules about pit road — during caution, drivers who are wanting to pit must enter pit road in turn 2, drive <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> back stretch through the apron of turns 3 and 4 and down the front stretch, exiting pit road in turn 1. This rule eliminated the inherent disadvantage of pitting on the back stretch. During green flag pit stops, cars with pit stalls on the back stretch enter the pits in turn 2 and exit in turn 3; those with pits on the front stretch enter in turn 4 and exit in turn 1. Since the new pit rules were instituted, several drivers (most notably Jeff Gordon) have made major mistakes during green flag pit stops by driving through both pit roads when only one is necessary for green flag pit stops.|$|E

[...] "I was feeling the emotions, but to see (the fans) react like that. Then the push truck pushed me around and to see them <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> (<b>the</b> frontstretch) doing that, I was like, ‘I don't know if I've ever experienced something like that.’ And that to me made it all worth it right there to have that feeling," [...] said Gordon of his triumph.|$|E
500|$|The red-backed fairywren is {{endemic to}} Australia {{and can be}} seen along rivers and the coast from Cape Keraudren in {{northern}} Western Australia through the Kimberleys, Arnhem Land and the Gulf Country and into Cape York, with the Selwyn Range and {{upper reaches of the}} Flinders River as a southern limit. It is also found on the nearby offshore islands Groote Eylandt, Sir Edmund Pellew, Fraser, Melville and Bathurst Islands. It then occurs <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> east coast east of the Great Dividing Range to the Hunter River in New South Wales, [...] preferring wet, grassy tropical or sub-tropical areas, with tall grasses such as bladygrass (Imperata cylindrica), species of Sorghum, and Eulalia. It is not a true migrant, although it may be locally nomadic due to the changes in vegetation, and may leave its territory after the breeding season. The species will retreat to fire-resistant cover at times of fire.|$|E
500|$|The irregularly shaped spores measure from 7.2 to 11.6 by 5.1 to 7.9 micrometres (μm), each {{featuring}} a few thick protusions. Abnormal spores {{of a different}} shape, sometimes with protrusions more distinct from the actual spore than is typical, can sometimes form; this is perhaps due to poor weather. The club-shaped basidia measure 25 to 40 by 9 to 14 μm, and each basidium bears four spores. The yellowish pleurocystidia (cystidia {{on the face of}} the gill) are ventricose or occasionally club-shaped, measuring 41 to 89 by 12 to 23 μm, including a cell wall up to 4.5 μm thick. The tip often bends and is encrusted with crystal-like structures, while the base tapers, or narrows into a small stalk. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of the gill) are much the same, but they are typically somewhat shorter and stouter. The longer caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) occur <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> stem and measure up to 99 μm in length with a more variable shape. The mushrooms also feature [...] "paracystidia", club-shaped cystidia-like structures on the gills lacking crystals, as well as [...] "cauloparacystidia" [...] on the stem. In Inocybe saliceticola, the paracystidia are fairly abundant, with thin cell-walls, while the abundant cauloparacystidia can have slightly thicker walls and are often arranged in clusters.|$|E

[...] Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, calling it [...] "A sweet and visually lovely tale of love lost." [...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "The sweetness, the visual flourishes and inspired pieces of casting carry the Corpse Bride, if not <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> primrose path, then at least across the threshold." [...] Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "If Nightmare Before Christmas was a jazzy pop number, Corpse Bride is a waltz--an elegant, deadly funny bit of macabre matrimony." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "The film does have a fairy-tale aspect, but, like many of its characters, it is more dead and buried than fully alive." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Corpse Bride is an unexpectedly touching celebration of love told in a quirky and inventive style." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three and a half stars out of five, saying [...] "In the guise of a family film, Burton evokes a darkly erotic obsession that recalls Edgar Allan Poe and Hitchcock's Vertigo. It would be a test for any filmmaker, and Burton aces it." ...|$|E

When the Canal finally reached Cumberland in 1850, the Railroad had already arrived eight years before.
