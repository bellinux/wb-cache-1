40|$|Zero {{tolerance}} <b>and</b> public <b>shaming</b> {{are increasingly}} advocated for both {{crimes of the}} powerless and crimes of the powerful. In this essay we argue against zero tolerance with respect to both kinds of crime. However, we defend naming <b>and</b> <b>shaming</b> with respect to crimes of the powerful. Part I of the paper begins from the assumption that both zero tolerance <b>and</b> naming <b>and</b> <b>shaming</b> are policies that do not merit serious consideration with crimes of the powerless. It {{then goes on to}} consider harder questions: first whether zero tolerance and then naming <b>and</b> <b>shaming</b> have a place with crimes of the powerful. Drug abuse is used in Part II as a case study to explore these distinctions. It will be contended that zero tolerance is a prescription for increasing drug abuse, but that naming <b>and</b> <b>shaming</b> is essential to the prevention of drug abuse. This conclusion is reached by viewing the drug problem differently from conventional criminological analyses in a radically reconfigured context as a corporate crime and organizational regulation problem...|$|R
