500|$|In an {{interview}} with Fuse in August 2012, Q-Tip confirmed that {{he was working with}} Carey on material for her fourteenth studio album. In April 2014, Carey confirmed that she and Q-Tip had worked together on a song which was yet to be mixed in {{an interview}} with Radio.com. Of the collaboration, Carey said [...] "He's <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> because he thinks that I didn't allow him to do his mix, but really it's okay. He loves me, we're going to make this work. And that's good because it's one of my favorite songs. I'm going to call him soon... I think we need to get that ready." [...] She also stated that {{it was the first time}} they had worked together since composing [...] "Honey" [...] for Carey's sixth studio album, Butterfly (1997).|$|E
500|$|Somewhat {{overshadowed by}} Henderson's winning goal, was a four-point game by Phil Esposito, two goals and two assists, and {{a hand in}} all three goals of the third period. Esposito was the only player on either team to score four points in a game during the series. According to Ron Ellis, he had [...] "never seen another player have a period where {{there was so much}} {{pressure}} and was still able to accomplish what he did." [...] Sinden considered it to be Esposito's [...] "finest hour." [...] Esposito describes it as [...] "there was no stopping me. And I think some of the guys got a little <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> If we had lost, I would have been the goat. But we didn't lose. I just had enough faith in myself, that I was going to get it done, one way or another." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} later added as a video {{interlude}} on The MDNA Tour in 2012, {{as a tribute}} to Tyler Clementi and other teens who had committed suicide due to bullying. The film, which was created by Swedish director Johan SÃ¶derberg, morphed Madonna's face with a number of famous figures, including then-Chinese President Hu Jintao, US Republican former presidential candidate Sarah Palin and Pope Benedict XVI. The face of French far right politician Marine Le Pen appeared on the screen with a swastika superimposed on her forehead, before it morphed into the face of Adolf Hitler. Le Pen was infuriated by the video, and threatened to sue Madonna should this happen during her concert in France on July 14, 2012, also known as Bastille Day, the French National Day. Socialist French government spokesperson Najat Vallaud-Belkacem had also expressed her disappointment. However, Madonna kept the video unchanged on this date, prompting Le Pen to file a lawsuit against her. A spokesman for Le Pen said a lawsuit for [...] "public insult" [...] would be lodged with the Paris courts in the next few days. Madonna responded to the lawsuit saying [...] "I know that I made a certain Marine Le Pen very <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> And it's not my intention to make enemies." [...] She later explained in an interview with Brazilian network Rede Globo, that the sequence was about [...] "intolerance that we human beings have for one another. And how much we judge people before knowing them. That's why it's done in the song 'Nobody Knows Me.'" [...] During her concert in Nice, France, the swastika was removed and was replaced by an interrogation mark.|$|E

60|$|My dear Friend,--I {{have done}} your bidding {{and sent the}} {{translations}} to the 'Athenaeum,' attaching to them an infamous prefatory note which says all sorts of harm of Gregory's poetry. You will be very <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> it and <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|MRS MARCH. And no {{business}} to meddle with practical affairs. You {{and he always}} ride {{in front of the}} hounds.

2500|$|Sacchetti's version differs: [...] "When I {{proposed}} to Lucio my original treatment for Per Sempre, which {{was nothing more}} than a sequel to The Postman Always Rings Twice in which a dead man returns to life, he became really enthusiastic and had my story read by a producer friend of his who then commissioned me to write a finished script. At that time, Fulci assumed that he would direct it. Later, for various reasons, problems arose and the film was never made. Four years later, (Lamberto) Bava used my script to make Per Sempre and Fulci, who was not working much at the time, got <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and started hurling these accusations. It's one thing for him to say that we were originally supposed to make the film together, but to claim that he originated the story and that I stole it from him is pure science fiction".|$|E
2500|$|Felix responded on 27 November 1916: [...] "Your {{presence}} by {{the middle}} of December is essential. The plan I'm writing you about has been worked out in detail and is three quarters done, and only the finale is left, and for that your arrival is awaited. It (the murder) is the only way of saving a situation that is almost hopeless.... You will serve as the lure.... Of course, not a word to anyone." [...] A frightened Irina suddenly backed out of the plan on 3 December 1916: [...] "I know that if I come, I shall certainly get sick... You don't know how things are with me. I want to cry all the time. My mood is terrible. I've never had one like it before... I don't know myself what's happening to me. Don't drag me to Petrograd. Come down here instead. Forgive me, my dear one, for writing such things to you. But I can't go on any more, I don't know what's the matter with me. Neurasthenia, I think. Don't be <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> please don't be angry. I love you terribly. I can't live without you. May the Lord protect you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes;--for ever. But I do {{not know}} why {{everybody}} is to be <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> Other girls may do as they please. If you are <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> I had better go back to London at once." ...|$|E
60|$|Hilda {{sighed and}} looked at him again intently without speaking. She stood so, face to face with him across the table for fully two minutes; and then, seeming {{suddenly}} to awake from a reverie, she started and sighed once more, and turned at last reluctantly to leave the little study. 'I must go,' she said hastily; 'mamma would be very <b>angry</b> indeed <b>with</b> <b>me</b> if she knew I'd come here; but I couldn't let you leave the house without coming up to tell you how greatly I admire your spirit, and how very, very much I shall always miss you, Mr. Le Breton. Will you take this, and keep it as a memento?' As she spoke, she laid an envelope upon the table, and glided quietly out of the room.|$|R
6000|$|The widow put one arm (the {{other was}} not at liberty) round her daughter's waist. [...] "You foolish child," [...] she said, [...] "will you never {{understand}} that your poor mother is getting old and irritable? I may think {{you have made a}} great mistake, in sacrificing yourself to the infirmities of an asthmatic stranger at Munich; but as to being ever really <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> you----! Kiss <b>me,</b> my love; I never was fonder of you than I am now. Lift my veil. Oh, my darling, I don't like giving you to anybody, even to Fritz." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not altogether, Christopher. I {{came because}} I am distraught, {{and you are}} a better friend than none at all, and--where else should I go? Also my poor father with his last words to me, {{although}} he was so <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> you, bade <b>me</b> seek your help if there were need--and--oh! Christopher, I came because you swore you loved me, and, therefore, it seemed right. If I had gone to the Nunnery, although the Prioress, Mother Matilda, is good, and my friend, who knows, she might not have let me out again, for the Abbot is her master, and not my friend. It is our lands he loves, and the famous jewels--Emlyn has them with her." ...|$|R

6000|$|Let me {{call you}} so--I must--even {{if it makes}} you angry to [...] think of such an unworthy wife as I. I must cry to you [...] in my trouble--I have no one else!

Can you not come to me now, at once, [...] before {{anything}} terrible happens? O, I know you cannot, [...] because you are so far away! I think I must die if you do [...] not come soon, or tell me to come to you.

60|$|But {{it was of}} no use getting <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> Waterford, {{especially}} as I saw he intended walking {{all the way down}} to the ferry <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> so I told him I didn't live in any house at all.|$|R
