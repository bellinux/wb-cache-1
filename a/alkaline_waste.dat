Incinerator ash produced in municipal treatment facilities and marble-dust produced during marble cutting process are <b>alkaline</b> <b>wastes.</b> This paper examines the carbon mineral sequestration potential of mixing <b>alkaline</b> <b>wastes</b> in two soil samples in accelerated carbonation conditions. Six different percentages of <b>alkaline</b> <b>wastes</b> in 20 g sample were used. Batch reactor conditions were maintained at 40 °C, relative humidity 60 - 70 % and CO 2 flow-rate of 10 litres-a-minute. Optimum water content was found by carrying out experiments on a sample with 7 different water-to-solid ratio (0, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6, 0. 8, 1 and 1. 2). The particle-size effect was gauged by taking soil samples sieved through standard sieve sizes of BSS 25 and BSS 50. It was concluded that low water-to-solids ratio is better for carbonation, although some minimum amount of water is necessary for reaction. The optimum water-to-solids ratio for incinerator ash comes to be 0. 4. Marble dust {{was found to be}} inefficient to capture CO 2 due to lower pH and due to lump formation. As expected, carbonation was higher for samples with less particle size and higher surface area...|$|R

Mixing the <b>alkaline</b> <b>waste</b> with the solid phases yielded several reaction products: brucite (Mg(OH) 2) ' calcite (CaC 03), and possibly a sodium metasilicate.

Mixing the <b>alkaline</b> <b>waste</b> with a synthetic brine yielded brucite, calcite, and whewellite (CaC 20 4 ??H 20). The thermodynamic model PHROPITZ predicted that brucite and calcite would precipitate from solution in the dolomite and siltstone mixtures and in the alkaline waste-brine system. After 155 days of solid-liquid contact, the dilute acidic waste had not significantly altered the mineralogical composition {{of any of the}} three rock types. The model PHREEOE indicated that calcite was thermodynamically stable in the dolomite and siltstone mixtures, and it was detected in small quantities in the aged-solid samples.

Removal of {sup 90 }Sr in the proposed treatment flashed is based on coprecipitation from strongly <b>alkaline</b> <b>waste</b> by adding stable strontium to the waste solution.

Among them, a fungus identified as Fusarium solani IHEM 8026 shows a good potential for cyanide biodegradation under alkaline conditions (pH 9. 2 to 10. 7). Results of K(sup 14) CN biodegradation studies show that fungal metabolism seems to proceed by a two-step hydrolytic mechanism: (i) the first reaction involves the conversion of cyanide to formamide by a cyanide-hydrolyzing enzyme, cyanide hydratase (EC 4. 2. 1. 66); and (ii) the second reaction consists of the conversion of formamide to formate, which is associated with fungal growth. No growth occurred during {{the first step of}} cyanide degradation, suggesting that cyanide is toxic to some degree even in cyanide-degrading microorganisms, such as F. solani. The presence of organic nutrients in the medium has a major influence on the occurrence of the second step. Addition of small amounts of yeast extract led to fungal growth, whereas no growth was observed in media containing cyanide as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen. The simple hydrolytic detoxification pathway identified in the present study could be used for the treatment of many industrial <b>alkaline</b> effluents and <b>wastes</b> containing free cyanide without a prior acidification step, thus limiting the risk of cyanhydric acid volatilization; this should be of great interest from an environmental and health point of view...|$|R

It contains elevated concentrations of oxyanion forming elements such as Al, As, V and Mo that are mobilised at high pH together with other trace metals including Cu and Ni. The red mud spill at Ajka, Hungary released 1 million m 3 of caustic red mud into the surrounding area. As part of the initial clean-up, some thinner red mud deposits (< 5 cm) were ploughed into fields to prevent dust formation whereas wetland areas were left untreated. This study used aerobic and anaerobic batch microcosms together with XAS spectroscopy, (HPLC) -ICP-MS and solid phase extraction techniques to investigate the effects of red mud addition to unaffected soils with respect to biogeochemical processes and trace element release. Experiments were designed to be analogous to soil conditions following the remediation efforts.

Gypsum addition to red mud affected soils showed a reduction in aqueous oxyanion concentrations compared to soils with red mud addition alone indicating that it is potential ameliorant for red mud contaminated soils.
