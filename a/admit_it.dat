5|$|De Hauteclocque {{broke his}} leg {{in two places}} in a fall from his horse in 1936. He told his company {{that it was his}} own fault for riding on the {{shoulder}} of the road. Thereafter he frequently walked with a cane. After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with barbed wire, he told them that when you have done something really stupid, it is best to <b>admit</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Padang in {{the early}} 20th century Dutch East Indies, Samsulbahri and Sitti Nurbaya–children of rich noblemen Sutan Mahmud Syah and Baginda Sulaiman–are teenage neighbours, classmates, and {{childhood}} friends. They begin to fall in love, but they are only able to <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> after Samsu tells Nurbaya {{that he will be}} going to Batavia (Jakarta) to study. After spending the afternoon at a nearby hillside, Samsu and Nurbaya kiss on her front porch. When they are caught by Nurbaya's father and the neighbours, Samsu is chased out of Padang and goes to Batavia.|$|E

5|$|Sam Jones III plays Pete Ross, another {{best friend}} of Clark's {{and the first}} person to whom Clark voluntarily tells his secret. Although he is in love with Chloe, he does not <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> because of the Clark-Lana-Chloe love {{triangle}} already in place. Ross was written out of the series at the end of season three, but made a guest appearance in season seven. Jones was the last of the series regulars to be cast, with Gough and Millar seeing him four days before they began filming the pilot. In the comics Ross is Caucasian, but the producers chose to cast Jones (who is African-American).|$|E
5|$|She has a {{very good}} voice. She's quite shy about it and won't <b>admit</b> <b>it.</b> Lots of people are {{knocking}} on my door to meet her about everything, movies, what-not. But she's not really interested in any of it. She just wants to go to school. She says to me, 'Mum, I just want to be a normal kid. I'm not ready for any of that.' I respect that, and if she ever wants to work with me on any level, I welcome it. But otherwise, I leave her to homework and school.|$|E
5|$|The {{students}} learn {{during their first}} day of classes that academics are weighed equally with performance. Doris, overwhelmed by the energy and spontaneity in the lunchroom, flees and meets Montgomery. As the year progresses, Coco tries to convince Bruno to book performing gigs with her. Doris befriends Montgomery, but worries that she is too ordinary against the colorful personalities of the other students. Leroy and his English teacher, Mrs. Sherwood, clash over his refusal to do homework. It is later revealed that Leroy is illiterate and ashamed to <b>admit</b> <b>it.</b> Bruno and his father argue over Bruno's reluctance to play his electronic music publicly. Miss Berg, the school's Dance teacher, warns Lisa {{that she is not}} working hard enough. Michael, a graduating senior, wins a prestigious scholarship and tells Doris that the William Morris Agency wants to send him out for auditions for television pilots.|$|E

25|$|A week later, Engel {{listened to}} the first four composers and, though they {{followed}} his instructions, the songs were flat and nothing special. Gayle played his song next and, though he explicitly violated Engel's instructions, Engel couldn't help but <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> was the best and perfect for the show. Engel would later comment that he was glad Gayle had not followed his instructions.|$|E
25|$|Joaquin Phoenix as the Abbé du Coulmier, the well-loved {{administrator}} at Charenton asylum. A profoundly religious man, {{he treats}} his wards with kindness and {{allows them to}} express themselves artistically. He {{is in love with}} Maddy, though he does not <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> to her or himself. Before settling on Joaquin Phoenix, casting directors considered Jude Law, Guy Pearce, and Billy Crudup for the role.|$|E
25|$|In non-Orthodox {{denominations}} of Judaism most rabbis {{hold that}} Jews {{have nothing to}} fear from engaging in theological dialogue, and may have much to gain. Some hold that in practice Soloveitchik's distinctions are not viable, for any group that has sustained discussion and participation on moral issues will implicitly involve theological discourse. Thus, since informal implicit theological dialogue will occur, one might as well <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> and publicly work on formal theological dialogue.|$|E

25|$|I {{knew the}} Englishmen would test me {{out as soon}} as I walked out. Ian Botham. Bob Willis. I {{remember}} facing Ian Botham when I went out there, and he did test me out. Fortunately enough I did hook him for a six, but I must <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> was more of a top edge. Adelaide Oval had quite short square boundaries, and it managed to clear them for a six. Of course he tested me out a few more times.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of obstructive {{sleep apnea}} is {{significantly}} more common among people in relationships, who are alerted to their condition by being informed by their sleeping partner since individuals with {{obstructive sleep apnea}} are often unaware of the condition. There is a stigma associated with loud snoring, {{and it is not}} considered a feminine trait. Consequently, females {{are less likely to be}} told by their partners that they snore, or to <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> to themselves or doctors. Furthermore, CPAP is also perceived negatively by females, and less likely to be utilized to its full extent in this group.|$|E
25|$|The usual source {{which is}} quoted in this instance, is Melis Stoke, a chronicler {{in the service}} of count Floris V of Holland, but {{although}} he tries to back up the Hollandic claims on the Frisian territories, he lacks sound arguments. He suspects the counts of Holland obtained their rights as heirs to one Gerolf, Count in Friesland (the operative word here being in), who had been count of Holland during the Franconian period, which was at that time a part of Greater Frisia, but even there he has to <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> is only as suspicion.|$|E

25|$|In November 1952 Harold W. Parsons, an art {{historian}} and one of Warren's past companions, took responsibility for selling the cup and approached the New York collector Walter Baker, however Baker was hesitant to proceed. In February 1953 it was posted by Thomas to Walter Baker, however US Customs impounded the box requiring a decision from Washington to <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> as pornography, it was refused entry to the US on this basis and took until October 1954 {{to be returned to}} the UK, by which time Thomas had died. After this event, a number of museums declined to buy it. Thomas' widow sold the cup to the dealer John K. Hewett. Hewett offered the cup to Denys Haynes, Keeper of the Greek and Roman department at the British Museum who then sought an opinion from his friend Lord Crawford, a trustee of the museum. However the decision went no further as they thought that they would never persuade the museum's trustees who were chaired by the Archbishop of Canterbury.|$|E
25|$|While {{planning}} {{what to do}} next, Banzai and the Cavaliers are met by John Parker (Carl Lumbly), {{a messenger}} from John Emdall (Rosalind Cash), {{the leader of the}} alien Black Lectroids of Planet 10, currently in Earth's orbit. Emdall explains that they have been at war with the hostile Red Lectroids for years, but had managed to banish them to the eighth dimension. Lizardo's failed test of the overthruster in 1938 allowed the Red Lectroids' leader, John Whorfin, to take over Lizardo's mind and enable several dozen others to escape. Now that Banzai has perfected the overthruster, Emdall fears Whorfin and his allies will try to acquire it to free the other Red Lectroids. Emdall had shocked Banzai previously to allow him to see the Lectroids for who they are, and now tasks him with stopping Whorfin or otherwise the Black Lectroids will fake a nuclear explosion to start World War III that will annihilate the Earth and the Red Lectroids with it. The Cavaliers track down the Red Lectroids to Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems in New Jersey, finding that their arrival in 1938 was told by Orson Welles' broadcast of The War of the Worlds until the Lectroids forced him to <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> was a work of fiction. Yoyodyne has been building a spacecraft to cross over to the eighth dimension under the pretense of a new United States Air Force bomber.|$|E

"All cricket {{writers of}} {{the last half century}} have been {{influenced}} by Cardus, whether they <b>admit</b> <b>it</b> or not, whether they have wished to be or not, whether they have tried to copy him or tried to avoid copying him. He was not a model, any more than Macaulay, say, was a model for the aspiring historian. But just as Macaulay changed the course of the writing of history, Cardus changed the course of the writing of cricket. He showed what could be done. He dignified and illuminated the craft".|$|E
