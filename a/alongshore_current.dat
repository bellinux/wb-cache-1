40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} coastal trapped waves on the continental margin of the northwestern Mediterranean. Cyclonically propagating waves along the coast were determined by cross-correlating <b>alongshore</b> <b>current</b> and sea level time series measured at different locations. Significant correlations between <b>alongshore</b> <b>current</b> time series were obtained at different time lags corresponding to the first three coastal trapped waves (CTW) modes. However, correlations between sea level time series were just found for the first CTW mode. The wind-forced coastal trapped theory (with bottom friction and scattering) {{was applied to the}} region and model output was compared with data. This application used five coastal sections, a summer or winter stratification, and winds from five coastal sites. The model was able to successfully reproduce observed <b>alongshore</b> <b>current</b> fluctuations in the Catalan Sea. The impact of stratification on CTW was proposed as the mechanism which reduces the effect of the complex topography on low-frequency alongshore flow. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Copyrighted by American Geophysical Union. The {{dynamics}} of vorticity motions forced by wave groups incident on an alongshore-uniform barred beach are analyzed. For both normally and obliquely incident wave groups, the potential vorticity and enstrophy equations {{reveal that the}} temporal variability of wave group–forced vortices is directly linked to the variability in the incoming wave groups rather than bottom friction, as previously hypothesized. Analysis of the lifespan of individual vortices further shows that the wave group forcing is responsible for not only the temporal variations of the vortices but also their eventual demise. Vortices in the simulations persist for 5 to 45 min, {{which is consistent with}} recent field observations. For oblique wave groups, the resulting vortices are advected by the mean current, yielding a signature in the frequency–wave number spectrum that is similar to that usually attributed to shear instabilities of the <b>alongshore</b> <b>current.</b> These results may explain previous observations of alongshore-propagating vorticity motions {{in the presence of a}} stable <b>alongshore</b> <b>current.</b> For simulations involving an unstable <b>alongshore</b> <b>current,</b> we find that the inclusion of wave group forcing results in velocity spectra that are much broader compared to the simulations that neglect wave grouping, which could explain discrepancies between previously observed and modeled spectral widths of propagating vorticity motions. Finally, the potential enstrophy balance shows that vorticity production due to wave groups may be as important as that due to the instability process and that not all low-frequency vortical motions observed during oblique wave incidence should be attributed to shear instabilities of the <b>alongshore</b> <b>current...</b>|$|E
40|$|Nearshore {{circulation}} is {{the mean}} {{flow in the}} region from the shoreline to about a kilometer offshore. An understanding of nearshore circulation is important to understanding sediment transport, pollution dispersion, {{and the distribution of}} various marine invertebrates. This thesis addresses the following question. Are the dynamics of the <b>alongshore</b> <b>current</b> described by a 1 -D balance (neglecting along­ shore variations) between wave and wind forcing against bottom stress and lateral mixing? Observations are used to close integrated momentum balance, suggesting that a 1 -D balance is appropriate. The alongshore bottom stress must be parame­ terized in models. Various parameterizations are examined in detail and it is found that most nonlinear parameterizations are adequate for modeling purposes. The <b>alongshore</b> <b>current</b> may also be unstable. For marginally unstable Reynolds num­ bers, the instability of the <b>alongshore</b> <b>current</b> is investigated analytically, and an amplitude equation for a weakly nonlinear shear wave is derived. The characteris­tics of a equilibrated shear wave (obtained from a 2 -D numerical model) are well described by the theory. FUture work will involve numerical modeling of nearshore circulation, and a nearshore circulation model I have implemented is described...|$|E
40|$|A new {{observational}} {{record of}} upper-ocean currents at 15 degrees N {{on the western}} coast of India is dominated by intraseasonal (55 - 110 day) variations of <b>alongshore</b> <b>currents,</b> whereas sea level at the same location has a clear seasonal signal. These observations can be interpreted {{within the framework of}} linear wave theory. At 15 degrees N, the minimum period for planetary waves is similar to 90 day, meaning that intraseasonal energy is largely trapped at the coast in the form of poleward-propagating Kelvin waves, while lower-frequency signals associated with the annual cycle can radiate offshore as planetary waves. This dynamical difference results in a steeper offshore slope of sea level at intraseasonal timescale, and thus stronger geostrophic <b>alongshore</b> <b>currents.</b> A consequence is that the <b>alongshore</b> <b>currents</b> are in-phase with intraseasonally-filtered sea level near the coast, and a gridded satellite product is shown to reproduce the current variations reasonably well. The intraseasonal current variations along the west coast of India are part of basin-scale sea-level fluctuations of the Northern Indian Ocean equatorial and coastal waveguides. The wind forcing associated with this basin scale circulation closely matches surface wind signals associated with the Madden-Julian Oscillation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{nonlinear}} {{dynamics of}} unstable <b>alongshore</b> <b>currents</b> in the nearshore surf zone over variable barred beach topography are studied using numerical experiments. These experiments extend the {{recent studies of}} Allen et al. [1996] and SImm et al. [1998], which utilized alongshore uniform beach topographies by including sinusoidal alongshore variation to shore parallel sandbars. The model involves finite difference solutions to the nonlinear shallow water equations for forced, dissipative, initial value problems and employs periodic boundary conditions in the alongshore direction. Effects of dissipation are modeled by linear bottom friction. Forcing for the <b>alongshore</b> <b>currents</b> is provided by gradients in the radiation stress, which are specified using linear theory and the dissipation function for breaking waves formulated by Thornton and Cuza [1983]. Distinct flows develop depending on the amplitude c and wavelength A of the topographic variability and the dimensionless parameter Q, the ratio of an advective to a frictional timescale. For Q greater than a critical value Qa the flows are linearly stable. For Q =- Q> 0 the flow can be unstable. For small values of Q the effect of increasing is t...|$|R

Regression analysis of the near-surface (20 - 25 m) currents with sea level indicates the surface currents are in geostrophic balance with the sea surface slope. Analysis of the alongshore shear between the near-surface and deep (75 - 80 m) layers with sea level shows the thermal wind relationship holds. A near-surface regression model is developed from which the mean monthly <b>alongshore</b> <b>current</b> 20 - 25 m below the surface can be estimated with a standard estimate of error (σ[subscript ER]) less than six cm/sec. The annual range at this depth is nearly 60 cm/sec. A regression model for the alongshore shear is formed from which the mean vertical shear is estimated with a σ[subscript ER] of. 07 -. 10 cm/sec/m.

40|$|Current meter {{moorings}} maintained {{over the}} Oregon continental shelf in 1973 and 1975 clearly show {{the difference between}} winter and spring oceanographic regimes and the rapid transition between the regimes. In winter the mean <b>alongshore</b> <b>current</b> is northward at all depths and strongest near shore; there is no mean vertical shear, no mean offshore density gradients, and mean sea level is high. In spring the mean <b>alongshore</b> <b>current</b> is weak near the bottom and strongly southward at the surface with a maximum over the mid-shelf; the strong vertical shear is balanced by strong offshore density gradients, and mean sea level is low. In both 1973 and 1975 the transition between these regimes occurs within about a week during a strong southward wind event. In many respects the transition event does not differ significantly from previous southward wind events, but the lateral density gradients established during the transition event exceed those of earlier events. The transition {{appears to be the}} result of a large cumulative offshore Ekman transport caused by local wind stress rather than by propagation of effects generated elsewhere. The lateral density gradients and the vertical shear established during the transition event subsequently persist, even during northward wind events with moderate onshore Ekman transport...|$|E
40|$|Time {{series of}} coastal sea level during 1976 – 77, from 2 ° 12 ′S to 17 °S {{along the west}} coast of South America, show that low-frequency, ω < 0. 25 cycles per day (cpd), {{fluctuations}} propagate poleward with the phase speed of baroclinic Kelvin waves (2 – 3 m s⁻¹). The alongshore coherence is highest in the frequency band 0. 1 – 0. 2 cpd. Computing the frequency-domain empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) for <b>alongshore</b> <b>current,</b> from an army of current meters extending from 5 °S to 15 °S during March-May 1977, gives 70 % {{of the variance in the}} 0. 1 – 0. 2 cpd frequency band to an EOF mode with poleward phase propagation at 2. 75 m s⁻¹. The vertical structure of the <b>alongshore</b> <b>current</b> fluctuations (0. 1 – 0. 2 cpd) over the continental slope at 5 °S and 15 °S is consistent with a first-mode baroclinic Kelvin wave. The current and sea-level fluctuations are coherent and propagate poleward through latitudes where their frequency equals the local inertial frequency. The fluctuations are not significantly coherent with coastal winds from 4 °S to 15 °S and am therefore presumed to have an equatorial origin. Intermittent sea-level data at the Galapagos Islands during the period provide tenuous evidence that these fluctuations, propagating poleward as coastally trapped waves, previously traveled in the equatorial wave guide...|$|E
40|$|Mechanisms {{controlling}} the dissolved iron {{distribution in the}} North Pacific are investigated using the Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling (BEC) model with a resolution of approximately 1 ° in latitude and longitude and 60 vertical levels. The model is able to reproduce the general distribution of iron as revealed in available field data: surface concentrations are generally below 0. 2 nM; concentrations increase with depth; and values in the lower pycnocline are especially high in the northwestern Pacific and {{off the coast of}} California. Sensitivity experiments changing scavenging regimes and external iron sources indicate that lateral transport of sedimentary iron from continental margins into the open ocean causes the high concentrations in these regions. This offshore penetration only appears under a scavenging regime where iron has a relatively long residence time at high concentrations, namely, the order of years. Sedimentary iron is intensively supplied around continental margins, resulting in locally high concentrations; the residence time with respect to scavenging determines the horizontal scale of elevated iron concentrations. Budget analysis for iron reveals the processes by which sedimentary iron is transported to the open ocean. Horizontal mixing transports sedimentary iron from the boundary into <b>alongshore</b> <b>currents,</b> which then carry high iron concentrations into the open ocean in regions where the <b>alongshore</b> <b>currents</b> separate from the coast, most prominently in the northwestern Pacific and off of California...|$|R

Survey data from a major nesting beach in the northern Gulf of Mexico, where a revetment was installed, {{was used to assess}} spatial distribution of loggerhead emergences. Through use of Quadrat analysis and piecewise linear regression with breakpoint, we present evidence to suggest that nest site selection in loggerheads is determined in the nearshore environment, and by characteristics such as wave height, <b>alongshore</b> <b>currents,</b> depth and patterns of erosion and accretion. Areas of relatively dense nesting were found in areas with relatively strong <b>alongshore</b> <b>currents,</b> relatively small waves, a steep offshore slope and the largest historical rates of erosion. Areas of relatively dense nesting also corresponded to areas of low nesting success. Both nesting and non-nesting emergences were clustered immediately adjacent to the revetment and at other eroding sites along the beach. These results suggest that alterations to the nearshore environment from activities such as construction of a jetty, dredging or installation of pilings, may impact sea turtle nest distribution alongshore. We also show that piecewise linear regression with breakpoint is a technique that can be used with geomorphological and oceanographic data to predict locations of nest clumping and may be useful for managers at other nesting beaches. © 2013...|$|R

The biomass of the cold neritic copepods including Calanus marshallae, Pseudocalanus mimus and Acartia longiremis (dominants in the eastern Bering Sea, coastal Gulf of Alaska, and NCC) was estimated from a 15 year time series of zooplankton samples (1996 – 2010) collected biweekly at a coastal station 9 km off Newport Oregon U. S. A. The alongshore currents and the biomass of the cold neritic copepods exhibit a strong seasonal pattern and fluctuate in opposite phase: positive <b>alongshore</b> <b>current</b> (from south) leads to low biomass in winter and negative <b>alongshore</b> <b>current</b> (from north) leads to high biomass in summer. When the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is positive, i. e., warm conditions around the northeast Pacific, there is more movement {{of water from the}} south in the NCC during winter. When the PDO is negative, there is more movement of water from the north during summer. The mean biomass of cold neritic copepods was positively correlated with the survival rate of juvenile coho salmon and cumulative transport was negatively correlated with coho salmon survival, i. e., in years when a greater portion of the source waters feeding the NCC enters from the north, the greater the salmon survival. We conclude that alongshore transport manifests PDO signals and serves as a linkage between large scale forcing to local ecosystem dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Mean cross-shore {{wave height}} {{transformation}} and alongshore currents observed on near-planar and barred beaches are compared with predictions {{based on the}} nearshore numerical model Delft 3 D. Delft 3 D solves the two-dimensional, depth-averaged, momentum balance (2 -DH) between forcing (by breaking waves and variations in mean surface elevation), changes in momentum flux, bottom stress and lateral mixing. The observations were acquired on the near-planar California beaches at Torrey Pines and Santa Barbara and the barred beach at Duck, N. C., and include {{a wide range of}} conditions with maximum mean currents of 1. 5 m/s. The model has two free parameters, a depth dependent breaking term, a, and the bed roughness length, s k. An empirical formula to determine a a priori from the deep-water wave steepness and bed slope is developed, showing good agreement in the wave height transformation. Including rollers in the wave forcing results in improved predictions of the observed <b>alongshore</b> <b>current</b> structure by shifting the predicted velocity maxima shoreward and increasing the velocity in the trough of the bar compared with model predictions without rollers. On near-planar beaches and high-energy events on barred beaches, a one-dimensional (alongshore uniform bathymetry) model performs as well as 2 -DH. On barred beaches under moderate conditions when alongshore non-uniform bathymetry prevails, the 2 -DH model performs better than the 1 -D model, particularly in the bar-trough region. Wave forcing balances the bottom stress with a second balance between alongshore variation in the mean surface elevation (pressure gradients) and the inertia of the <b>alongshore</b> <b>current.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Copyrighted by American Geophysical Union. Alongshore-separated {{time series}} of natural swash motions were {{obtained}} over {{a range of}} environmental conditions using a video technique. Although the frequency spectra and normalized wavenumber spectra for these motions were particularly bland, wavenumber-frequency spectra of these data showed clear partitions of infragravity band energy levels associated with various wave types. For the frequencies 0. 025 < ƒ ≤ 0. 05 Hz, 45 ± 13 % of the shoreline variance was, on average, associated with high-mode (n ≥ 2) edge waves and/or leaky waves, while approximately half that amount was associated with low-mode edge waves. Gravity wave motions (comprising both edge and leaky modes) were typically dominant in a lower-frequency band (0. 001 < ƒ ≤ 0. 025 Hz). A {{substantial portion of the}} variance in this band (21 ± 10 %, with a maximum of 38 %), however, was identified as a nondispersive waveform with wavenumbers well outside of the wavenumber-frequency bounds for gravity waves. Surprisingly, this nongravity swash variance showed no significant dependence on mean <b>alongshore</b> <b>current</b> strength or mean <b>alongshore</b> <b>current</b> shear as measured in the surf zone trough separating the shoreline from an offshore bar. In addition, the celerities of these swash zone nondispersive waves were found to differ in magnitude, and in one instance, sign, from celerities of similarly structured waves measured farther offshore in the surf zone. These unexpected observations with respect to low-frequency, nongravity swash energy imply a strong decorrelation between trough and shoreline fluid motions...|$|E
40|$|A two-part {{modeling}} {{study of}} the wind-forced flow on the continental shelf off northern California in the region (37 ° - 40 °N) of the Coastal Ocean Dynamics Experiment (CODE) is pursued. This paper involves a process-oriented study with idealized wind stress forcing. Gan and Allen [2002] involves forcing with observed winds and heat flux for April-May 1982 and comparison of model results with CODE observations. A characteristic, but previously unexplained, response observed during CODE following the weakening, or relaxation, of southward upwelling favorable winds is the time-dependent development of northward currents over the inner shelf next to the coast. The presence of northward winds is not necessary for this occurrence. The objective in {{this paper is to}} investigate the dynamics of the shelf flow response to upwelling wind relaxation events under idealized conditions. In the basic case experiment a spatially uniform upwelling favorable southward wind stress of 0. 1 Pa is applied to the ocean initially at rest. The stress is held constant for 10 days and then decreased linearly to zero over 3 days. In response to the southward wind stress, southward <b>alongshore</b> <b>currents</b> develop on the shelf accompanied by upwelling of cold, dense water near the coast. Considerable spatial variability in the shelf flow, clearly related to the alongshore variations in coastline and bottom topography, is found. The <b>alongshore</b> <b>currents</b> tend to separate from the coast south of capes, and the coldest surface water is found at those locations. As the winds decrease, northward currents, similar to those observed, develop on the inner shelf next to the coast at many alongshore locations. Examination of the alongshore momentum balances shows that the northward currents are forced by a northward pressure gradient force associated with negative alongshore pressure gradients. These pressure gradients are set up by the interaction of the wind-forced flow with the alongshore variations in shelf topography. In general, negative alongshore pressure gradients, intensified off Pt. Reyes and Pt. Arena by the gradient wind balance, are found south of capes. The negative pressure gradients geostrophically balance onshore flow at depth, and upwelling is strengthened in these locations. North of capes, positive pressure gradients that are primarily in balance with nonlinear advective effects are found. After the winds cease the forced across-shelf circulation weakens, and the resulting unbalanced negative pressure gradients south of the capes accelerate the <b>alongshore</b> <b>currents</b> northward. Processes with similar dynamics are found embedded in the more complex coastal ocean response to observed time varying winds by Gan and Allen [2002]...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{cycles of}} {{irradiation}} during burial and bleaching due to solar exposure during transport increase the Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) sensitivity of quartz sand grains. The {{relationship between the}} OSL sensitivity and sediment transport allows to discriminate quartz sand grains with different depositional histories. In this paper, we evaluate the variation of OSL sensitivity in quartz grains deposited during the progradation of the Ilha Comprida barrier on the southern Brazilian, coast. Changes in sand sensitivity recorded by barrier growth since 6 ka ago are controlled by the variation {{in the proportion of}} low versus high sensitivity quartz grains. Low sensitivity grains with short sedimentary history are supplied by the Ribeira de Iguape River and reach the barrier through southward <b>alongshore</b> <b>currents</b> during fair weather conditions. Storm conditions shift the <b>alongshore</b> <b>currents</b> to northeast and permit the transport of high sensitivity grains with long sedimentary history from distal southern coastal sectors to the barrier. Therefore, the input of distal sediments for the Ilha Comprida barrier depends on the frequency and intensity of storms. Thus, the OSL sensitivity can be used as proxy for storm activity. The variation of OSL sensitivity through time indicates that the Ilha Comprida barrier changed from a relatively stable to an unstable storm pattern around 2 ka ago. Periods with increased storm activity peaked around AD 500, AD 1500 and AD 1850, approximately on the boundaries of the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 A {{new method}} is {{introduced}} for incorporating bathymetric uncertainty into predictions of nearshore and river flows (i. e., unstratified flows primarily forced by pressure and radiation stress gradients). The method {{involves the use}} of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) as a parameter estimation scheme, where the parameter to be estimated is the spatial field of bathymetry. That is, bathymetry is treated as a slowly varying uncertain parameter in the model, which can be corrected via the assimilation of other available observations. The reason bathymetry is targeted is, as we show, it is often a limiting factor for accuracy in real-world modeling applications. Results are shown using data from four field experiments. Two experiments involve measurements in the nearshore (surf zone) ocean at Duck, NC. There, we show that bathymetric uncertainty due to rapid bathymetric change (time scale of days), or simply lack of available measurements, can cause significant error in model predictions of waves and currents. We demonstrate the ability of the EnKF to reduce this error by correcting the bathymetry, which we then cross-validate using in-situ measurements. Specifically, the correction is achieved by assimilating in-situ observations of <b>alongshore</b> <b>current</b> and significant wave height, as well as (in a separate experiment) remote-sensing observations of <b>alongshore</b> <b>current,</b> wave celerity, and location of shoreline. Similarly in a river environment (Snohomish River, WA, and Kootenai River, ID), we demonstrate the EnKF using twin tests, assimilating pseudo-observations of currents from a variety of hypothesized platforms (fixed in-situ gages, passive drifters, and Doppler radar). Again, the EnKF is found to yield accurate estimates of bathymetry...|$|E
40|$|Patches of {{transverse}} finger bars {{have been}} identified in the surf zone of Noordwijk beach (Netherlands). They consisted of three to nine elongated accumulations of sand attached to the low-tide shoreline. The bars extended up to 50 m into the inner surf zone, had an oblique orientation with respect to the shore-normal, and were quasiregularly spaced in the alongshore direction. We analyzed nearly 6 years of video data and observed a significant presence of finger bars (14 % of the time with good data). Bars were visible on 193 days, gathered in 44 events that persisted from 2 days to 2 months. Obliquely incident waves of intermediate and approximately constant height were dominant during finger bar presence. Shore-normal incident or more energetic wave fields destroyed the bar patches. The underlying bathymetry affected finger bar formation: inner surfzone troughs with cross-shore areas of 100 m 2 and inner surfzone slopes of 0. 02 were more conducive to their growth. The mean alongshore wavelength of the finger bar patches was 39 m, ranging from 21 to 75 m. Bar crests deviated up to 40 degrees from the shore-normal against the <b>alongshore</b> <b>current</b> direction ("up-current orientation") and bar patches migrated at rates up to 22 m/day {{in the direction of the}} <b>alongshore</b> <b>current.</b> We used these observations to test existing theoretical self-organization mechanisms for transverse bar formation.

Earlier observations have indicated that this resemblance, alsotermed “coupling,” may take several forms. Here we apply a nonlinear 2 DHmorphodynamic model with time-invariant forcing {{to show that the}} angle of waveincidence (Â) is crucial for the alongshore-variable morphodynamic evolution of the innerbar, for a given crescentic outer bar. In contrast to previous modeling efforts ofdouble-barred systems, which mostly used highly idealized boundary conditions, weforce our model with realistic hydrodynamics and bathymetrical data derived from videoobservations at the double-barred Gold Coast, Australia. The results show that for smallangles of wave incidence (Â < 10 ı) over a crescentic outer-bar, cell-circulation patternsgovern the ﬂow at the inner bar, giving rise to rip channels that incise the inner bar at thelocations of the landward perturbations in the outer bar (horns). On the other hand, forobliquely incident waves (Â = 10 ı– 20 ı) over a crescentic outer bar, the circulatory natureof the ﬂow disappears and gives way to a meandering <b>alongshore</b> <b>current.</b> Theoffshore-directed sections of this meandering <b>alongshore</b> <b>current</b> erode the inner-bardowndrift of the outer-bar horns, leading to landward perturbations of the inner bar thatare coupled to the outer-bar horns; an observed coupling type that had not beenreproduced as yet.

To assess the increase in skill provided by this procedure, the geostrophic <b>alongshore</b> <b>currents,</b> calculated from the new SSH fields in the gap region, are compared to three in situ, nearshore current measurements, resulting in correlation coefficients of 0. 73 – 0. 83 and standard deviations of the differences of 11. 6 – 12. 6 cm/s, substantially improved from the AVISO-only results.

40|$|During {{the fall}} of 2003, an {{extensive}} measurement campaign called the “Nearshore Canyon Experiment” (NCEX) was set up {{along the coast of}} La Jolla, California. The project site covered an area in which two submarine canyons are located, respectively La Jolla and Scripps Submarine Canyon. Over 20 institutions collaborated on recording the hydrodynamics and morphological changes. The collective objective of these institutions was to gain more insight into nearshore processes. The canyons are responsible for substantial changes in wave energy distribution over an alongshore distance of a few hundred meters. The irregular wavefield that arises in the direct vicinity of the canyons results in a complex nearshore circulation and in morphological changes in the surfzone. The following research objectives were proposed for this study: 1) “What is the relative contribution to the <b>alongshore</b> <b>current</b> of (i) alongshore water level gradients due to the alongshore variation of wave set-up and (ii) obliquely incident waves?” And 2) “Can the numerical model Delft 3 D reproduce the order of magnitude and direction of the nearhore currents?” This master thesis describes the hydrodynamic circulation in the nearshore during the measurement campaign and the results of the numerical model Delft 3 D for two specific cases, respectively a day with wind sea and a day with swell waves. The incident waves drive currents and create wave set-up. Owing to the influence of the submarine canyons, alongshore gradients develop in the wavefield. It is concluded that the influence of the submarine canyons becomes more prominent in case of swell waves and therefore a larger alongshore set-up gradient arises. In both the observations and the model predictions an <b>alongshore</b> <b>current</b> develops strong enough to counteract the wave-driven flow.

It {{was found to be}} high in the recent, near shore silt-clay predominant sediments towards Alleppey (average 3. 8 %) than those to-wards Azhikode (average 1. 97 %). The sand predominant offshore relict sediments contain very low organic matter values (average 0. 71 %). The high organic matter content in the inner shelf is mainly controlled by the fine texture of the sediment in conjunction with other parameters like primary production in the overlying waters, terrestrial organic detrital supply and <b>alongshore</b> <b>currents</b> indicating present day deposition. The low amount of organic matter in the outer shelf may be due to existing high energy non-depositional conditions for the settlement of fine sediment, high dissolved oxygen in the overlying waters and sandy texture of the sediment representing mid-Holocene deposition...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of the eastern Paciﬁc equatorial circulation on {{the dynamics of the}} Northern Humboldt Current System is studied using an eddy‐resolving regional circulation model forced by boundary conditions from three distinct ocean general circulation models. The seasonal variability of the modeled nearshore circulation and the mesoscale activity are contrasted in order to evaluate the role of the density forcing. The seasonal variability of the surface and subsurface <b>alongshore</b> <b>currents</b> strongly depends on the amplitude and timing of the seasonal eastward propagating equatorial waves. The equatorward flow and upwelling intensity are also impacted by nonlinear processes, such as the seasonal generation of nearshore mesoscale eddies, which create alongshore pressure gradients modulating the surface current. Boundary conditions affect differently the intensity and phase of the eddy kinetic energy, as baroclinic instability is triggered by coastal waves during austral summer and fall, whereas it is sustained by the wind‐driven upwelling during austral winter...|$|R

This study examines such a leading hydraulic parameter under the simplified hypothesis of 2 D motion and presents a prediction model that has been validated by a wide ensemble of experimental data. Starting from an approach originally proposed by Dalrymple and Dean [(1971). Piling-up behind low and submerged permeable breakwaters. Discussion note on Diskin et al. (1970). Journal of Waterways and Harbors Division WW 2, 423 – 427], the model splits {{the rise of the}} mean water level into two contributions: one is due to the momentum flux release forced by wave breaking on the structure, and the other is associated with the mass transport process.

40|$|Inverse {{models are}} {{developed}} that use data and dynamics to estimate optimally the breaking-wave-driven setup and <b>alongshore</b> <b>current,</b> {{as well as}} the cross-shore forcing, alongshore forcing, and drag coefficient. The inverse models accurately reproduce these quantities in a synthetic barred-beach example. The method is applied to one case example each from the Duck 94 and SandyDuck field experiments. Both inverse solutions pass consistency tests developed for the inverse method and have forcing corrections similar to a roller model and significant cross-shore variation of the drag coefficient. The inverse drag coefficient is related to the wave dissipation, a bulk measure of the turbulence source, but not to the bed roughness, consistent with the hypothesis that breaking-wave-generated turbulence increases the drag coefficient. Inverse solutions from a wider range of conditions are required to establish the generality of these results. 1...|$|E
40|$|Coastal {{systems are}} {{influenced}} {{by a combination of}} waves and tides. In certain cases, tide-induced alongshore currents can be of similar order or even larger than wave-induced currents. Until now, however, no detailed wave-resolving modelling studies included tidal currents. This paper presents a method to implement alongshore tidal currents by adding a pressure term to the alongshore momentum balance and includes modifications to the numerical wave maker to allow for both waves and currents to be generated. The method is successfully validated by comparing simulations with and without inclusion of the tidal current to measurements obtained from the COAST 3 D data set. Wave prediction is equally good with and without the tidal implementation, but the <b>alongshore</b> <b>current</b> and its distribution over the cross-shore are much better predicted by the model with the new method.

Besides providing substantial information on the surface frontal jet associated with the Peru Coastal Current and the surfacing Peru-Chile Undercurrent that flows poleward trapped on the continental shelf and slope, the glider data reveal the presence of an intense deep equatorward current, which transports up to ˜ 2. 5 Sv. The dynamics of this current are investigated using an eddy-resolving regional model. The variability of the vertically sheared alongshore flow is shown {{to be related to the}} passage of a poleward propagating coastal-trapped wave likely of equatorial origin. Solutions from a two-dimensional, linear, coastal wave model suggest that the <b>alongshore</b> <b>current</b> observed vertical structure is associated with the second and third baroclinic modes of the coastal-trapped wave...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Mean <b>alongshore</b> <b>currents</b> {{observed}} on two barred beaches are com-pared with predictions {{based on the}} one-dimensional, time- and depth-averaged alongshore momentum balance between forcing (by breaking waves, wind, and 10 – 100 km scale alongshore surface slopes), bottom stress, and lateral mixing. The observations span 500 hr at Egmond, Netherlands and 1000 hr at Duck, N. C., and include {{a wide range of}} conditions with maximum mean currents of 1. 4 m/s. In-cluding rollers in the wave forcing results in improved predictions of the observed alongshore-current structure by shifting the predicted velocity maxima shoreward and increasing the velocity in the bar trough compared with model predictions without rollers. For these data, wave forcing balances the bottom stress within the surfzone, with the other terms of secondary importance. The good agreement between observations and predictions implies that the one-dimensional assumption holds for the range of conditions examined, despite the presence of small along-shore bathymetric nonuniformities. With stronger bathymetric variations the model skill deteriorates, particularly in the bar trough, consistent with earlier modeling and laboratory studies. 1...|$|R
40|$|Turbulence in the surfzone and nearshore mixes {{momentum}} vertically, transmits {{stress to}} the sea bed, influences {{the structure of the}} cross- and <b>alongshore</b> <b>currents,</b> and controls the suspension of sediment from the sea bed. In many coastal and shelf environments, the sea-bed is the primary source of turbulence due to bottom induced shear. In the surfzone, the breaking-wave generated turbulence likely dominates over bottom generated turbulence. However, the dynamics of turbu lence in the nearshore and surfzone under breaking waves is poorly understood. Realistic three-dimensional simulations of surfzone hydrodynamics and sediment transport, which are currently being attempted, for example, in the recent nearshore NOPP project, will not be possible without at least a rudimentary understanding of breaking-induced turbulence dynamics. Long term goals include addressing some of the unresolved science issues through analysis and modeling of existing field measurements to quantify turbulence dynamics. This will significantly improve both circulation and sediment transport modeling. OBJECTIVES Understanding and accurately modeling the three dimensional nearshore circulation and sediment transport are goals of the ONR Coastal Geosciences Program.

40|$|The Gulf of Kachchh is {{a funnel}} shaped, {{macrotidal}} water body {{located in the}} arid region of northwestern India with ~ 50 cm annual rainfall and insignificant fluvial input.

Contrary to the prevalent offshore reducing trend for most of the Indian Coast, the Gulf is anomalous for having an enhanced turbidity at the mouth with lower concentrations in the inland areas. The hydrography of the Gulf is dominated by strong, <b>alongshore</b> <b>currents</b> at the mouth which move in (out) during flood (ebb), and undergo cyclic, dynamic changes with tidal phases.
