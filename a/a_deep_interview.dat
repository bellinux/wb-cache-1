40|$|As a {{means of}} {{addressing}} the failure rate of information systems Aggestam (2001) proposes a framework which aims to guide organisations {{in the development of}} this type of software system. Software is a common concept today and can therefore be anticipated in contexts other than organisations. Examples of such contexts can be given as: embedded software, scientific software and personal computer software. The literature informs that 20 % of these software projects are failures and 46 % experience cost and schedule overruns. In an attempt to address this failure rate the aim of this report will be to investigate if the framework proposed by Aggestam (2001) can also be applied in this type of software project. Through a comprehensive literature study success factors pertaining to software projects where an organisational information system has not been built have been identified.

The study analyses information from three different sources. The first one is a data base from the national survey of science, technology and innovation in Costa Rica.

There are clear difficulties for the universities and the public research centers to develop satisfactory links with firms. It is a high concentration of the investment in science and technology in the academic sector. It would be natural that firms have access to the efforts by research centers. However, it is obvious that the percentage of firms that has an effective linkage with the universities and public research centers is very low.

Furthermore, the children are also neglected by laws and thus, they are forced to work in any heavy conditions as potential labor force. To the extent, the structural adjustment politics of neoliberalism has been started to adapt after 1980 s have accelerated the above poverty process and created a new urban poor who become unprotected and weak as regard to social rights, wages and working conditions determined by this so-called flexible economy.

40|$|The {{voluntary}} sector and non-profit organisations {{has always been}} at a crossroad. Voluntary sector theories and practice may either choose to implement mainstream management theory into a different not for profit context (Agart, 2011; Beck et al., 2008); or they depend on a relatively small set of knowledge that embraces the particularities of the sector (for example Classens, 2015; Richards & Hall, 2016). Research on Leadership of voluntary organisations has been stratified into an exploration of leadership styles (Bang, 2011; Northouse, 2009) {{and the development of}} conceptual considerations based on the member-exchange theory. In our paper we reverse the order and argue that mainstream leadership theory would benefit from an investigation of leading processes and realities in non-profit organisations. Leaders in the {{voluntary sector}} have to operate in a volatile, resource-constrained context while engaging employees and donors around a specific cause. We draw on Bourdieu’s “Distinction” and the notion of Symbolic Capital to conceptualise leaders as symbolic capital mechanisms. An empirical investigation of the three largest NGOs in Greece reveals three key patterns of ‘successful’ non-profit leaders: the personalisation of the organisation, a strong influence of the mass media and the narrative rationalisation of internal challenges and resources scarcity. On <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> level, <b>interviews</b> with members of the researched organisations reveal the role of perceived authenticity and ‘applied wisdom’ in constructing influence and stability within an otherwise volatile organisational setting. Although we are reluctant to specify methods of good leadership, we argue that there are findings and lessons that could inform leadership research which has been examining the concepts of wisdom (see Nonaka & Takeuchi, 2011) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} project has {{set out to}} determine how best a corporation can {{bridge the gap between}} sustainability reporting and operations and establish the overarching characteristics a corporation can implement in order to promote sustainability within their operations. In order to achieve this goal, I looked at two categorically different corporations: companies that have been proactive to sustainability and companies who have been reactive, those being corporations who have developed sustainability strategies in response to market pressures. Through a sustainabilitycomparative analysis, determining which category achieves sustainability goals more often and more successfully and <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> analysis through <b>interviews</b> and further research to determine how corporations within each category promote sustainability initiatives within their organiza- tion differently, I was able to establish overarching sustainability characteristics. I determined corporations deemed proactive outperformed those deemed reactive when it comes to successful- ly achieving sustainability goals and that sustainability strategies are promoted differently name- ly through the integration of the sustainability departments into the corporate structure and im- plementation of sustainability initiatives into employee mandates. Ultimately I established a set of overarching characteristics that can be employed in order to promote sustainability and bridge the gap between sustainability reporting and operations: those being CEO buy-in, quantifiability, disclosure and integrative reporting...|$|R
40|$|A {{heuristic}} {{investigation was}} undertaken in which four counsellors {{who live with}} {{a significant amount of}} chosen contemplative silence in their lives were interviewed in order to explore the impact, if any, that their way of life had on the therapeutic relationship. The in depth, open ended interviews took the form of the narrative enquiry. As the ‘bricoleur’ my analysis was based on an emergent design utilizing heuristic methodology. The literature search which revealed a paucity of previous material demonstrates that silence in the lives of counsellors enhances their way of being with clients, making them more self aware and able to relate at <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> level. The <b>interviews</b> discovered that whilst {{there were a number of}} benefits to the counsellor, there were also some difficulties to address. The benefits were an increased self-awareness, relational depth, mindfulness and acceptance. The difficulties raised were that the subject of contemplation or meditation is a difficult area to verbalize, there is a reticence to be transparent about it, and that there are occasions when the fact that the counsellor has access to something that is not understood by the client this may impair the counselling relationship. Findings are presented in the form of individual depictions of each of the four co-researchers, a composite depiction and a creative synthesis. Further research would be beneficial to explore this phenomenon in more depth...|$|R

40|$|Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) in 2012 {{promoted}} “a hundred- year couples of low-carbon wedding activity” {{to raise}} the citizen’s, wedding suppliers’, catering traders’, and wedding adviser companies’ cognitions toward the low-carbon wedding started in the wedding waves of Centennial. To encourage the newly weds to elaborate creations, the government prepares a low-carbon wedding guidebook for the healthy and environmental low-carbon wedding. Recently, some newly weds also incorporated environmental protection, social care and green consumption into the wedding. 　　According to some researches, the largest amount of spending money in operating wedding process is the wedding reception (Zhou, 2008). The wedding reception has a great significance for Chinese on the traditional concepts. It become especially important for the newly wed’s parents to compare the wealth and magnificence (Liu, 2000). Nontheless, many creative thoughts have been gradually influenced by the time changes and environmental consciousness. Thus, {{the purpose of this}} study is to discuss the wedding consumers and wedding suppliers toward the conceptual cognitions and performing recognitions of “green wedding receptions”. 　　This study develops the questions from the low-carbon wedding guidebook published by EPA, and then chooses nine wedding suppliers to have <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>interview,</b> at the same time produces a questionnaire to survey the latent wedding consumers. The study shows that only part of wedding reception suppliers have cognitions about the green wedding reception. However, if the government can promote the concept powerfully, provide the performing plan and the consumers are willing to support the green wedding reception, the suppliers will have a highly performing recognition. Also, through our survey shows that the actual and most important descision makers of the wedding consuming place are newly weds’ parents, and the newly couples come in second. Therefore, the concept of green wedding reception should be greatly promulgated to the newly weds’ parents. The latent consumers feel highly cognitions and recognitions to the partial content of implementing the guided green wedding receptions, but they cannot be fully carry out in the implementation. It is said the reason may be the civil wedding reception suppliers cannot provide the supporting green wedding reception for consumers to choose. 　　Although vegetable food can lower the carbon emission, through the research studies, we can know that green wedding reception is not a vegetarian diet but a focus on the productions of food origin, the growing quality, and cooking ways to lower the impact toward the environment. To strength the call for the healthy diet for the modern people and attain the supply and demand balancing protection for the earth and eco-environment, the green wedding reception will be accepted and carried out by the public. 　　 2012 年行政院環境保護署，為提升國人、婚紗業者、餐飲業者及婚禮顧問公司對低碳婚禮的認知度，於建國百年結婚熱潮湧現開始，推動「百年琴瑟低碳婚禮活動」，鼓勵新人發揮創意舉行健康且環保的低碳婚禮，特此製作低碳婚禮指引手冊。近年來的確有新人於婚禮與婚宴中融入了環境保護、社會關懷與綠色消費等概念。 　　執行婚禮運作流程中所消費金額以婚宴占最大宗(卓怡君， 2008) ，婚宴在中國人的傳統概念中深具意義，通常亦是長輩們間接比較財富與氣派程度的場合(劉鳳媛， 2000) ，但隨著時代變遷新人們已漸融入現代西方婚禮運作概念，有許多創新的思維，因應時代變遷與環保意識抬頭，本研究嚐試探討潛在婚宴消費者與婚宴供給者對「綠色婚宴」概念認知與執行認同度。 　　本研究以行政院環境保護署所發行之低碳婚禮指引手冊(2012) 中發展出研究問卷，選擇九家婚宴供給者進行深入訪談，及對五百位潛在婚宴消費者實施問卷調查。研究發現，對婚宴供給者而言，唯有部分業者對綠色婚宴有所認知，但若政府可大力推廣觀念與提出執行方案加上消費者願意支持綠色婚宴，業者則對綠色婚宴有高度執行認同。對潛在婚宴消費者而言，決定婚宴消費模式與地點其決策者以新人的父母親居多，其次才是準新人，所以綠色婚宴應對正確的消費族群加以推廣，潛在婚宴消費者對綠色婚宴實施指引中部分內容感到認知與認同，但在執行上卻無法完全落實，其原因推測為坊間婚宴供給者無法完全提供綠色婚宴配套供消費者選擇外，其綠色婚宴之執行理念亦須突破許多傳統婚宴上的思維。 　　雖然素食可減少碳排放量，但透過研究資料整理可知，綠色婚宴並不完全等同素食婚宴，而是在葷、素食材中著重產地來源、生長環境品質、葷素食材使用的比例與烹調料理的方式以降低對環境的衝擊，強化現代人對健康飲食的訴求，對地球與生態環境加以維護取得供需平衡而設計的綠色婚宴，才可被大眾所接受執行與推廣。誌謝辭　i 中文摘要　іі 英文摘要　ііі 內容目錄　v 表目次　vii 圖目次　ix 第一章 緒論 第一節 研究背景與動機　 1 第二節 研究目的與問題　 3 第三節 名詞釋義　 4 第四節 研究流程　 4 第二章 文獻探討 第一節 綠色消費的定義　 6 第二節 婚禮與婚宴的演變與婚禮市場經濟規模　 8 第三節 低碳綠色婚禮執行現況　 12 第三章 研究方法 第一節 質性研究設計　 16 第二節 量化研究設計　 21 第四章 研究結果與分析 第一節 回收樣本特性分析　 33 第二節 傳統婚宴、婚宴前置作業、婚宴餐食供應問項之分析　 35 第三節 綠色婚宴、場地佈置決策、場地設備決策、購買決策問項分析　 38 第四節 質性訪談資料分析　 42 第五章 研究結論與建議 第一節 研究結論　 57 第二節 研究限制　 60 第三節 後續研究建議　 61 參考文獻　 62 附錄 附錄一　潛在婚宴消費者正式問卷　 65 附錄二 W 1 業者訪談內容逐字稿　 70 附錄三 W 2 業者訪談內容逐字稿　 75 附錄四 W 3 業者訪談內容逐字稿　 80 附錄五 W 4 業者訪談內容逐字稿　 83 附錄六 H 1 業者訪談內容逐字稿　 86 附錄七 H 2 業者訪談內容逐字稿　 88 附錄八 H 3 業者訪談內容逐字稿　 93 附錄九 R 1 業者訪談內容逐字稿　 96 附錄十 R 2 業者訪談內容逐字稿　 10...|$|E
40|$|Thesis title: Approach to {{palliative care}} among nursing care {{students}} of the Faculty of Health and Social Studies of the South Bohemian University. This bachelor thesis is dedicated to students undergoing their practical training in St. Jan Nepomuk Neumann Hospice in Prachatice. I decided to choose this topic for several reasons. Hospices are often discussed nowadays, they are massively publicized and numerous charity events are held for hospices. Nevertheless {{people do not have}} confidence in hospices, they are afraid of them. This might be the first reason. The other one is my own experience with students coming to the hospice for their practical training. I work in the hospice as a ward sister and am in everyday contact with the students. Unfortunately most of the students are persuaded {{at the beginning of their}} training that death comes every day to this ?house?. They have fear and cannot imagine how to cope with this situation during a fortnight stay?! The aim of our research was to find out whether the present studies influence the attitudes to the incurably ill among the students. Whether their attitudes change after the theoretical and practical training. We set two basic questions to reach the goal. 1 : How does theoretical schooling of palliative care influence the attitudes of students to the care for the incurably ill in the hospice? 2 : How does practical training of palliative care influence the attitudes of students to the care for the incurably ill in the hospice? The research was implemented in two phases: before the start of theoretical schooling of palliative care and after the practical training in the hospice. We used the experiment method; <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>interview</b> with student was the questioning technique. The research sample consisted of 5 full-time {{students of the}} Faculty of Health and Social Studies of the South Bohemian University, specialization of general nurse. After processing the responses we found out that the attitude to the care for the dying had not changed a lot after theoretical schooling. The students feel lack of theoretical information that would help them eliminate the fear of unknown situation, fear of pain, fear of everyday confrontation with death and dying people. They also do not feel prepared for communication with the close relatives of the dying people. They are convinced that there is not enough time for such a complicated topic like care for incurably ill people in the schooling. Practical training in the hospice changes the attitudes of the students to the incurably ill. They were provided more information on the palliative-hospice care. They assess their own attitudes to the care of the terminally ill more positively and they no longer talk about fear and uncertainty. They would like to have more personal experience with communication with the patients and their families. The goal of the research was met. The present studies do influence students? attitudes to palliative care of the incurably ill in a hospice. However the fear of this not really new field still prevails. Changes only occur after practical training. The research results may be used for grasping the students? feelings, for possible modification of the didactics and methodology of theoretical and practical training in palliative care. The elaborated informational brochure might also help students choose practical placement and make the start of the practical training in an inpatient hospice easier...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Coming to new job is {{not that}} easy, {{sometimes}} the feeling of insecurity appears. Working for recruitment agencies includes constant changes of colleagues and places of work {{and at the same}} time one has two different managers. Who does the individual turn to when problems occur and who do the employed see as his/her manager? Why do people search for work in recruitment agencies? How does it feel not having a fixed place of work or colleagues and how do the aspects of this affect the employed psychosocial work environment? This is a few questions asked when we tried to find answers on the employed feelings about his/hers psychosocial work environment in a recruitment agency. The purpose of this study was to find <b>a</b> <b>deeper</b> understanding on employees working in a recruitment agency experiences their psychosocial work environment on the basis of social support, demands and control. To find answers on our questions we made <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> qualitative <b>interview</b> with eight employees from a recruitment agency. We had help from the recruitment agency with the selection of respondents from our criteria’s. They had to be from different ages, genders and come from different ethnical backgrounds and the time of employment had to vary between them all. As earlier researches we discovered some deficiencies within the recruitment agency and particularly about the social relations. Coming to demands our respondents has not expressed any despair. On the other hand there are suggestions that the demands are higher from the customer and the stationary employees, than from the recruitment agencies managers. The employed recons they have control over their working situation, based on their right of saying no to assignments that does not appeal them. Earlier research shows that employees within a recruitment agency are employed for an average of two years and that personal turnover is high in this business. Our respondents has worked in this trade of industry for two weeks up to four years and a number of them has been offered stationary employment at customers. All of them have turned them down with the justification about them being comfortable in the recruitment agency business and that the customer has not been appealing. Our conclusion is that the experience of the psychosocial work environment can be seen as good. The positive experiences outweigh the negative experiences. Keywords: Psychosocial work environment, social support, demand, control, consultants and recruitment agency...|$|R
