500|$|White {{had little}} time to write due to her other {{academic}} obligations, and once said, [...] "belonging to things is <b>an</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>disease</b> of my profession". White became the English department chair in 1955 and once again in 1961. As chair, White recruited faculty members from established universities, fought for the recognition of her staff, and worked with the faculty members individually, as she would with her students. She wrote in the summers, often while she traveled. Aided by Guggenheim Fellowships, White visited most of Europe. On her first fellowship, she traveled in Italy and studied at Oxford University and the British Museum between 1928 and 1929 for a year. While abroad, White wrote English Devotional Literature, 1600–1640 and was inspired to start her first novel, A Watch in the Night. In mid-1930, she received her second fellowship to verify her work in England. She received {{a grant from the}} university to finish her 1935 The Metaphysical Poets in London. White was a visiting scholar at the California Huntington Library between 1939 and 1940, where she worked on Social Criticism in Popular Religious Literature of the Sixteenth Century. She returned to the library in mid-1941. White was a visiting professor at Barnard College between 1943 and 1944, and a visiting professor at Columbia University during the summer of 1948. She also had a strong interest in poetry, though she didn't think highly of her own.|$|E

2500|$|The {{signature}} {{proposal of}} Benoît Hamon was the implementation a {{universal basic income}} for all French citizens, rolled out in stages beginning in 2018, partially funded by a tax levied on property combining the existing property tax (taxe foncière) and the solidarity tax on wealth (ISF), {{in addition to a}} tax on robots to fund social protections in general. Like fellow Socialist dissidents, Hamon criticized the El Khomri labor law and promised to repeal it if elected, and suggested that it be replaced with legislation acknowledging the need for greater social protections, including the right to disconnect and recognizing burnout as <b>an</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>disease.</b> He also proposed to reduce the 35-hour workweek to 32 hours, saying {{that it was time to}} put an end to the [...] "myth" [...] of economic growth.

40|$|International {{audience}} Nonspecific {{low back}} pain and sciatica are prevalent diseases among working adults and have become <b>a</b> worrying <b>occupational</b> health issue because they sometimes affect continuation or resumption of employment. Epidemiological studies that based questionnaires on workers' healthcare consumption have shown a higher prevalence of these disorders in certain industrial sectors. Thus, low back disorders are usually more prevalent among workers exposed to cumulative lumbar load such as manual handling, awkward postures of the trunk and whole-body vibrations. In addition, morphological and biomechanical studies have compared disc space narrowing {{and the intensity of}} lumbar workload. Although debated, the relationship between disc degeneration and biomechanical work exposures seems to be usually accepted by most authors. In response to a considerable need of prevention and compensation for workers, {{low back pain}} and/or disc disease can be recognized as <b>an</b> <b>occupational</b> <b>diseases</b> in several countries but the criteria of recognition remains heterogeneous from one country to another. </p...|$|R
