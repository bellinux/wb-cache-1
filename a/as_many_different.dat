5|$|Following the post-touchdown kickoff {{and a short}} return, Nebraska's offense {{began work}} at its 21-yard line. Three rushes by <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> players—Joel Makovicka, Damon Benning, and Jay Sims—resulted in 11 yards and a first down. During Sims' run, Tech's Loren Johnson {{committed}} a 15-yard personal foul facemask penalty that pushed Nebraska to the Nebraska 47-yard line. From there, Frost threw an incomplete pass, then Sims ran twice for fifteen yards and a first down, crossing into the Virginia Tech half of {{the field in the}} process. Now at the Tech 38-yard line, Frost completed a 23-yard throw to Lance Brown, who picked up another first down at the Tech 15-yard line. With time running out in the quarter, the Cornhuskers executed a quick four-yard rush to the Tech 11-yard line. At {{the end of the first}} quarter, Virginia Tech led Nebraska, 70, but the Cornhuskers were in scoring position.|$|E
5|$|Sander Gommans {{started the}} {{composition}} of the basic melodies for Invisible Circles at the beginning of 2003 in his home studio in Reuver, working at the same time on new songs for the EP Exordium. This part of the creative process had been shared with Mark Jansen for the previous albums and it would be shared with keyboard player Joost van den Broek for the following ones. Gommans wrote the songs for the new album with the precise idea of pushing the music of the band closer to progressive metal, reducing the gothic atmospheres of the previous releases to a minimum and adopting <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> musical styles as he felt necessary to the convey the message of the songs. Meanwhile, his fiancée Floor Jansen was writing the lyrics and shaping the plot for the concept album.|$|E

Levels can be completed in many different ways based on what characters the player or players choose. When playing in single-player mode, once a character is unlocked it can be used on any level and any level can be completed as any character. In multiplayer mode, players work together to complete the levels. If one of the players dies, another must revive them before finishing the level.|$|E

25|$|Superficially, {{the ceiling}} is a Humanist construction. The figures are of superhuman {{dimension}} and, {{in the case}} of Adam, of such beauty that according to the biographer Vasari, it really looks as if God himself had designed the figure, rather than Michelangelo. But despite the beauty of the individual figures, Michelangelo has not glorified the human state, and he certainly has not presented the Humanist ideal of platonic love. In fact, the ancestors of Christ, which he painted around the upper section of the wall, demonstrate all the worst aspects of family relationships, displaying dysfunction in <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> forms as there are families.|$|E
25|$|Researchers have {{analysed}} the behaviour of chimpanzees, {{with particular}} reference to copulation calling. Copulation calling {{is a type}} of vocalisation used to attract mates. The calls are vocalised either before, during, or after sexual intercourse. Copulation calling, in line with Hrdy's hypothesis, may then be one way to ensure that the female can mate with <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> males as possible, causing paternity confusion. Indeed, the authors found that the probability of copulatory calling in female chimpanzees was not modulated by the ovarian phase of the female caller, thereby aiding paternity confusion. This paternity confusion ultimately ensures that the woman has access to the resources of a number of different males. These resources can be utilised by her, as well as by her offspring.|$|E

25|$|Stalybridge has an {{established}} musical tradition. Stalybridge Old Band {{was formed in}} 1809, perhaps the first civilian brass band in the world. The band currently contests in the second section. Carrbrook Brass currently contests in the fourth section and represent the town annually at the Armentières festival. An annual brass band contest has been held in the town on Whit Friday, since at least 1870. Other contests have been held {{on the same day}} in the surrounding villages of Millbrook, Carrbrook and Heyrod. There is now {{an established}} tradition of holding brass band contests on this day around Staybridge, Mossley and Saddleworth. Bands travel by coach from all over the United Kingdom, and sometimes from other countries, to contest in <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> locations as possible on the day.|$|E
25|$|Fly {{fishing is}} most renowned {{as a method}} for {{catching}} trout, grayling and salmon, {{but it is also}} used {{for a wide variety of}} species including pike, bass, panfish, and carp, as well as marine species, such as redfish, snook, tarpon, bonefish and striped bass. Many fly anglers catch unintended species such as chub, bream and rudd while fishing for 'main target' species such as trout. A growing population of anglers attempt to catch <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> species as possible with the fly. With the advancement of technology and development of stronger rods and reels, larger predatory saltwater species such as wahoo, tuna, marlin and sharks have become target species on fly. Realistically any fish can be targeted and captured on fly as long as the main food source is effectively replicated by the fly itself and suitable gear is used.|$|E

25|$|Apheresis {{platelets}} {{are collected}} using a mechanical device that draws {{blood from the}} donor and centrifuges the collected blood to separate out the platelets and other components to be collected. The remaining blood is returned to the donor. The advantage to this method is that a single donation provides at least one therapeutic dose, {{as opposed to the}} multiple donations for whole-blood platelets. This means that a recipient is not exposed to <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> donors and has less risk of transfusion-transmitted disease and other complications. Sometimes a person such as a cancer patient who requires routine transfusions of platelets will receive repeated donations from a specific donor to further minimize the risk. Pathogen reduction of platelets using for example, riboflavin and UV light treatments can also be carried out to reduce the infectious load of pathogens contained in donated blood products, thereby reducing the risk of transmission of transfusion transmitted diseases. Another photochemical treatment process utilizing amotosalen and UVA light has been developed for the inactivation of viruses, bacteria, parasites, and leukocytes that can contaminate blood components intended for transfusion. In addition, apheresis platelets tend to contain fewer contaminating red blood cells because the collection method is more efficient than “soft spin” centrifugation at isolating the desired blood component.|$|E

The tighter schedule, with only eight weeks of pre-production and 45 days of principal photography, still caused the production to have less location shooting than planned. Los Angeles ended up standing in for Dallas and London (though a shot was done in London with a double), and the ice scenes, initially envisaged for an ice field in Alaska, were moved to Whistler, British Columbia, nearby the show's regular locations in Vancouver. Principal photography for the film started on June 16, 1997.|$|E

500|$|The bold weights of Gill Sans, {{including}} Kayo, {{have been}} particularly criticised for design {{issues such as the}} eccentric design of the [...] "i" [...] and [...] "j", and for their extreme boldness. (Gill Sans' standard weight is, as already noted, already quite bold by modern standards.) Gill argued in his Essay on Typography that the nineteenth-century tendency to make sans-serif typefaces attention-grabbingly bold was self-defeating, since the result was compromised legibility. In the closing paragraph he ruefully noted how he had contributed to the genre: There are now about <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> varieties of letters as there are different kinds of fools. I myself am responsible for designing five different sorts of sans-serif letters – each one thicker and fatter than the last because each advertisement has to try and shout down its neighbours.|$|E

[...] A fleet of 95 target vessels was assembled in Bikini Lagoon. At the center of the target cluster, the density was 20 ships per square mile (7.7perkm²), three to five times greater than military doctrine would allow. The stated goal was not to duplicate a realistic anchorage, but to measure damage as a function of distance from the blast center, at <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> distances as possible. The arrangement also reflected the outcome of the Army/Navy disagreement about how many ships should be allowed to sink.|$|E
500|$|The initial {{idea for}} the DVD came to percussionist Shawn Crahan, {{three weeks before the}} band entered The Mansion in 2003, where they would work on their third studio album [...] Crahan {{received}} help from the band's record label Roadrunner, who supplied them with tapes, camera cleaning equipment and funds to hire people to operate the cameras when Crahan himself couldn't. Recording began when Slipknot entered The Mansion and continued until they had finished touring in 2005, reportedly covering 28 months of the bands time together. Crahan's intentions were to capture <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> Slipknot situations as he could, so when the opportunity to produce a DVD came, he would {{be in a position to}} begin work immediately. During the period in which the footage was being shot, Crahan began making little tests of the footage and revealed them to his fellow band mates, judging their reactions to help him establish areas of interest from them. The whole recording process produced over 300 60-minute tapes of footage.|$|E
