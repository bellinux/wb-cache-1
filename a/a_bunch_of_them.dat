[...] "I'd {{been trying to get}} into voiceovers," [...] she explained, [...] "so they called and said it was a pilot they were doing for FX, and I could record the part on my day off in 10 minutes." [...] The actress read the script and recorded her lines at a recording studio in Phoenix, Arizona; upon first glance, Greer suggested that the raunchy and risque nature of the script would prevent any television stations from picking up the series. [...] "So when I found out it was picked up, I was like, 'Oh! Wait, I don't know what you're talking about.' They said, 'Remember that thing?' And I went, 'Really?' So then I recorded <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> and the scripts were the funniest scripts that I've ever read, and so crazy." ...|$|E
500|$|With the {{graduation}} of Pat White, Brown {{was promoted to}} the starting position for the 2009 season. Against East Carolina, Brown led the Mountaineers to a 3520 victory and completed 24of 31pass attempts for 334yards and four touchdowns. For his performance, the Big East Conference named him the Offensive Player of the Week. The following week, West Virginia lost to Auburn, 4130. Brown completed 18of 32passes for 221yards and one touchdown, but also threw four interceptions and lost one fumble. After the game, head coach Bill Stewart defended Brown and said, [...] "He's learning, and we've got a lot of football to play. And I'm glad Jarrett Brown is my quarterback." [...] The Charleston Gazette wrote, [...] "Did he take some chances? Yes, and <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> paid off, which is why West Virginia led most of the game." [...] Against Colorado, West Virginia overcame a string of four consecutive fumbles in the first quarter, including one by Brown, to win 3524. Head coach Stewart credited Brown and running back Noel Devine with keeping the offense's composure.|$|E
500|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today was {{critical}} of the episode, writing [...] "It is possible [...] has worn out the Treehouse franchise. [...] three installments just seem to be reaching for jokes that aren't there, and falling in the attempt. [...] As you'd hope from The Simpsons, the segments all boast a few clever moments {{that will make you}} smile if not laugh. But they're not scary, they're not particularly funny, and outside of some tepid Twilight jokes, they're no longer even trying to be real parodies of the original stories." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club also gave the episode a negative review, and felt that [...] "There were laughs in all three segments, but the episode as a whole left something to be desired. The first [...] eventually descended into a long string of mostly lame board game jokes, as if the writers had been coming up with board game puns for the last 15 seasons or something and wanted an excuse to unload <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> all at once. The idea of Bart and Milhouse playing with a Ouija board ripoff was promising, so to see it descend into gags about Marge getting sucked into Clue was disappointing. There were fewer good gags [...] than in the board game segment, but it was balanced out by a fairly solid Hugh Laurie performance. Fortunately, the last segment, the inevitable Twilight parody, was funny across the board, both in how it took the piss out of the Twilight films and how it satirized vampire mania. [...] Still, it wasn't the best [...] "Treehouse" [...] ever, and you could make a good claim for it being the worst, particularly if the Twilight segment wasn't in there." ...|$|E

Once a band of antelope crossed a swale, running in silence, jerkily, like a train of some singular automatons, moved by sudden, uneven impulses of power.

6000|$|... § XI. The form of {{the common}} {{buttress}} must be familiar to the eye of every reader, sloping if low, and thrown into successive steps {{if they are to}} be carried to any considerable height. There is much dignity in them when they are of essential service; but even in their best examples, their awkward angles are among the least manageable features of the Northern Gothic, and the whole organisation of its system was destroyed by their unnecessary and lavish application on a diminished scale; until the buttress became actually confused with the shaft, and we find strangely crystallised masses of diminutive buttress applied, for merely vertical support, in the northern tabernacle work; while in some recent copies of it the principle has been so far distorted that the tiny buttressings look as if they carried the superstructure on the points of their pinnacles, as in the Cranmer memorial at Oxford. Indeed, in most modern Gothic, the architects evidently consider buttresses as convenient breaks of blank surface, and general apologies for deadness of wall. They stand in the place of ideas, and I think are supposed also to have something of the odor of sanctity about them; otherwise, one hardly sees why a warehouse seventy feet high should have nothing of the kind, and a chapel, which one can just get into with one's hat off, should have <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> at every corner; and worse than this, they are even thought ornamental when they can be of no possible use; and these stupid penthouse outlines are forced upon the eye in every species of decoration: in St. Margaret's Chapel, West Street, there are actually a couple of buttresses at the end of every pew.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} entanglement between collective {{operators of}} two blocks of oscillators in an infinite linear harmonic chain. These operators {{are defined as}} averages over local operators (individual oscillators) in the blocks. On the one hand, this approach of "physical blocks" meets realistic experimental conditions, where measurement apparatuses do not interact with single oscillators but rather with <b>a</b> whole <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> i. e., where in contrast to usually studied "mathematical blocks" not every possible measurement is allowed. On the other, this formalism naturally allows the generalization to blocks which may consist of several non-contiguous regions. We quantify entanglement between the collective operators by a measure based on the Peres-Horodecki criterion and show {{how it can be}} extracted and transferred to two qubits. Entanglement between two blocks is found even in the case where none of the oscillators from one block is entangled with an oscillator from the other, showing genuine bipartite entanglement between collective operators. Allowing the blocks to consist of a periodic sequence of subblocks, we verify that entanglement scales at most with the total boundary region. We also apply the approach of collective operators to scalar quantum field theory. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures, significantly revised version with new results, journal reference adde...|$|R
