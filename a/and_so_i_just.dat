She received Tony Award nominations for her performances in his plays, The House of Blue Leaves (1986) and Six Degrees of Separation (1990), for which she also won an Obie Award. The Alan Ayckbourn play Woman in Mind received its American premiere Off-Broadway in February 1988 at the Manhattan Theatre Club. The production was directed by Lynne Meadow and the cast included Channing {{in the role of}} Susan, for which she won a Drama Desk Award for Best Actress. When once asked if Susan was Channing's most fully realized character, the actress replied: Well, you like to think that they’re all fully realized because what you’re doing is different from what anyone else is seeing. You do a character but {{how much of it is}} on film, or how much of it is seen by an audience, is really up to the director, the piece, or the audience. <b>And</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> do these people. And flesh them out. I think anything else is not my job.|$|E

Programs used in the production included Studio Vision, by Opcode Systems, and Pro Tools, by Digidesign. Idol later recalled that {{the beginning of the}} recording sessions coincided with the onset of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. [...] "We'd just installed the computer in my music room, and there was a window above it overlooking the whole city. And there was a fire raging. There was smoke just pouring across the whole of LA. It was LA burning. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> straight quickly wrote the lyrics and sang them three times. What you're hearing on the single 'Shock to the System' is my news reportage of what I'm seeing." [...] Idol recalled for a German broadcast. [...] "We started the album with a riot. So that's really rock and roll." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Dickinson, his revitalised enthusiasm, {{brought about}} by Harris's idea to make a concept album, carried forward into the cover artwork, saying that [...] "I was {{probably}} responsible in a large part for the cover, with Derek." [...] Dickinson states that the idea to set the painting in a polar landscape may have originated from when he showed Riggs a Gustave Doré piece, depicting traitors frozen in a lake of ice in the ninth circle of Dante's Inferno. In contradiction of this, Riggs states that the setting was because he [...] "might have just seen a documentary about the North Pole or something ... I wanted something that was a departure from all the cityscapes and things. It was about prophecy and seeing the future, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> wanted something distant. And then they said, on the back, 'Could you stick all the other Eddies in the ice?' So I did." ...|$|E

But the loaves don't seem quite as big as they should be," [...] she added doubtfully.|$|R
2500|$|The 20/20 Experience was {{produced}} in a span of 20 days. Recording sessions for The 20/20 Experience began in the [...] "late part of May, first week in June" [...] and concluded in July 2012. [...] The album was recorded at EastWest Studios in Los Angeles, Jungle City Studios in New York City and Larrabee Studios in North Hollywood. Of Timbaland's participation, Wright said: [...] "(Their) relationship is like a brotherhood; they're just so comfortable with each other– not only as musical friends but as personal friends... {{that you can get}} things done {{in a short period of}} time. Had (the Affleck movie) not happened, we might have actually set up and put the album out sooner." [...] After recording was finished, Timberlake and Wright, with M2M Construction, begin [...] "formulating plans for how to release the music". Justin Timberlake, and most of the band used JH Audio in-ear monitoring systems. With regards to the album's lead single [...] "Suit & Tie", Timberlake shared with 97.1 AMP Radio/Los Angeles how the classic, [...] "Get out your seat, Hov" [...] lyric was born inside the studio with JAY-Z: [...] "I had finished the verses and I was going in to record them and he was sitting in the room working, freestyling to himself. And then he came up with a line he really liked and he jumped out of his seat and he said, 'Uh oh! Get out of that seat, Hov.' And I just thought it was so funny. It made me laugh. I was standing right beside him when he did it <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> put it on the record, more or less as a joke to him." [...] Timberlake added that the song harkens back to the glory years of the Rat Pack. [...] "Not to compare ourselves to those guys, but just the fun that they had," [...] he said. [...] "I was picturing like, being at the Sands in Vegas and saying, 'Oh, JAY-Z's in the house tonight. Uh, let's have him come up and do a number. Why don't you go ahead and get out of your seat, Hov?' That's more or less where it came from." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's why I'm here," [...] replied Mrs. Quack. [...] "I hope {{others feel}} the same way. I came here because <b>I</b> <b>just</b> HAD to find some place where people wouldn't expect to find me <b>and</b> <b>so</b> wouldn't come looking for me. Little Joe Otter saw me {{yesterday}} on the Big River and told me of this place, <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> because <b>I</b> <b>just</b> had to go somewhere, I came here." ...|$|R

5000|$|I {{thought he}} wanted me to audition, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> was <b>just</b> very relaxed and casual about the news. I didn't think he wanted to hire me, I knew that's not how things worked. The next day, they told me, you know that offer you didn't sound too excited about? It's an offer, not an audition. I flipped out. I didn't know how he was doing this! The next week I was in New Orleans.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir, not I," [...] {{answered}} the boy, laughing; [...] "I didn't {{think of any}} answer half so clever; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> gave him a dig in the nose, and that, laid on with right good will." ...|$|E

5000|$|On the {{invention}} of the skyscraper, Nevertheless and notwithstanding, I feel a very deep interest in the question. You see, they accuse me of inventing the skyscraper. I do know that I was one of the three men who first sprung it upon an unsuspecting public and have built dozens of it, improved it, fought for it and have been closely knit with it for forty years, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> am <b>just</b> silly enough, kind of Professor Tiernan-like, to defend the child-since grown into rather robust maturity-whether I be its sole or joint paternal relative.|$|R

[...] "They were playing ping-pong <b>and</b> stuff. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> asked, 'Can <b>I</b> record this song real quick?'"

60|$|I don't know {{anything}} about finance, and I never did, but I know some pretty shrewd financiers, {{and they told me}} that Mr. Bryan wasn't safe on any financial question.

I've got that vote yet, and I've kept it clean, ready to deposit at some other election.

6000|$|When the old father {{reached the}} narrow path {{he did not}} turn down it, but kept {{straight}} on, and I {{breathed a sigh of}} deep relief. But the next instant I remembered that the broad path turned not far beyond, and that the little one soon ran into it, and so it could not be long before the father and the lovers would meet. I like to tell Jone everything I am going to do, when I am sure that he'll agree with me that it is right; but this time I could not bother with explanations, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> told him to sit still for a minute, for I wanted to see something, and I walked after the young couple as fast as I could. When I got to them, for they hadn't gone very far, I passed the young woman's bath-chair, and then I looked around and I said to her, [...] "I beg your pardon, miss, but there is an old gentleman looking for you; but as I think he is coming round this way, you'll meet him if you keep on this path." [...] "Oh, my!" [...] said she unintentionally; and then she thanked me very much, and I went on and turned a corner and went back to Jone, and pretty soon the young man's bath-chair passed us going toward the gate, he looking three-quarters happy, and the other quarter disappointed, as lovers are if they don't get the whole loaf.|$|E
60|$|Just as I {{got close}} up behind Jone, {{and was about}} to make a rush past him, his man turned into a side street. Of course I turned too, and then I put on steam, and, giving a laugh as I turned around to look at Jone, I charged on, {{intending}} to stop in a minute and have some fun in hearing what Jone had to say about it; but you may believe, ma'am, that I was amazed when I saw only a little way in front of me the bath-chair stand where we had hired our machines! And all the bath-chair men were standing there with their mouths wide open, staring at a woman running along the street, pulling an old bath-chair man in a bath-chair! For a second I felt like dropping the handle I held and making a rush for {{the front door of the}} hotel, which was right ahead of me; and then I thought, as now I was in for it, it would be a lot better to put a good face on the matter, and not look as if I had done anything I was ashamed of, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> slackened speed and came up in fine style at the door of the Old Hall. Four or five of the bath-chair men came running across the street to know if anything had happened to the old party I was pulling, and he got out looking as ashamed as if he had been whipped by his wife.|$|E
500|$|Bill Szymczyk's has {{frequently}} been noted as {{the sort of}} producer who pushes bands to expand their musical horizons; he has been brought in with the specific intent of changing a band's sound. He himself has credited this tendency to his lack of musical knowledge, stating: [...] "I'm a professional listener. I listen and I react. I never was a musician, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> don't bring any preconceived prejudices to the table; I don't favour the guitar over the keyboard, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> forth. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> listen <b>and</b> {{try to figure out}} if I have anything I can bring to a song." ...|$|R

30|$|Second, {{participants}} reported to miss support for user-initiated logging (N =  4), such as logging one’s food intake, activities and body measurements, {{blood pressure and}} glucose. This led to {{a decrease in the}} use of the online tool over time: “I found myself frequently forgetting to input a meal or note the time I ran 12 blocks because I was late for a meeting. At that point, it started to feel like all my data was bunk <b>and</b> incomplete, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> ditched it all and went back to tracking steps” [P 93]. This emphasizes the need for data completeness. When a complete account of own behaviors was not attainable, the perceived value of the relevant of the tracker appeared diminished.|$|R
6000|$|... 28. Morning. O, faith, you're an impudent saucy {{couple of}} sluttikins for presuming to write so soon, said I to myself this morning; who knows {{but there may}} be a letter from MD at the Coffee-house? Well, you must know, <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> now sent Patrick, and he brought me three letters, but not one from MD, no indeed, for I read all the superscriptions; and not one from MD. One I opened, it was from the Archbishop;(7) t'other I opened, it was from Staunton;(8) the third I took, and looked at the hand. Whose hand is this? says I; yes, says I, whose hand is this? Then there was wax between the folds; then I began to suspect; then I peeped; faith, it was Walls's hand after all: then I opened it in a rage, and then it was little MD's hand, dear, little, pretty, charming MD's sweet hand again. O Lord, an't here a clutter and a stir, and a bustle? never saw the like. Faith, I believe yours lay some days at the post-office, and that it came before my eighteenth went, but that I did not expect it, and I hardly ever go there. Well, and so you think I'll answer this letter now; no, faith, and so I won't. I'll make you wait, young women; but I'll inquire {{immediately}} about poor Dingley's exchequer trangum.(9) What, is that Vedel again a soldier? was he broke? I'll put it in Ben Tooke's hand. I hope Vedel could not sell it.--At night. Vedel, Vedel, poh, pox, I think it is Vedeau;(10) ay, Vedeau, now I have it; let me see, do you name him in yours? Yes, Mr. John Vedeau is the brother; but where does this brother live? I'll inquire. This was a fast-day for the public; so I dined late with Sir Matthew Dudley, whom I have not been with a great while. He is one of those that must lose his employment whenever the great shake comes; and I can't contribute to keep him in, though I have dropped words in his favour to the Ministry; but he is too violent a Whig, and friend to the Lord Treasurer,(11) to stay in. 'Tis odd to think how long they let those people keep their places; but the reason is, they have not enough to satisfy all expecters, and so they keep them all in hopes, that they may be good boys in the meantime; and thus the old ones hold in still. The Comptroller(12) told me that there are eight people expect his staff. I walked after dinner to-day round the Park. What, do I write politics to little young women? Hold your tongue, and go to your Dean's.|$|E

It was a thing of knowing Brett forever, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> sat down and said, [...] "Well, {{we want to make}} records!" [...] At the time we were leaving Interscope. We weren't happy with Interscope at all. So we sat down and told them we wanted to make both All and Descendents records {{whenever}} we want, at our choosing. Brett and I worked out a deal like that, so it was really flexible and we could basically do whatever we wanted.|$|E

And the catfish doesn't know that we're actually doing it. They just sorta think maybe it could happen. So they don't know when or why or how. So it's tricky, but everything is real. The feelings are real, the relationships are real. We haven't created any scenarios, we don't tell people what to say or do. It's very unpredictable".|$|R

Henri Marais had given out that if I came near his daughter he would have me beaten back with [...] "sjambocks" [...] or hide whips. Perhaps he had gained some inkling of our last farewell in the peach orchard. I do not know. But I do know that if anyone had lifted a sjambock on me I should have answered with a bullet.
