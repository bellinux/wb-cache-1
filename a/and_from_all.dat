5|$|According to De ponderibus et mensuris, {{a famous}} 13th century text {{that exists in}} {{numerous}} variations and is often ascribed to Dino di Garbo, the system of weights used in Salerno {{was different from the}} systems used in Padua and Bologna. As {{can be seen from the}} table, it was also different from the Roman weight system used by Galenus and Dioscorides <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>all</b> modern apothecaries' systems: The ounce was divided into 9drachms, rather than 8drachms.|$|E
5|$|Cadet nurses {{came from}} across the nation <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>all</b> backgrounds.

5|$|Also to this end, and {{to provide}} more {{professional}} military leadership, Diocletian separated military from civil command at the lowest, provincial level. Governors of provinces on the frontiers were stripped of command of the troops stationed there in favour of purely military officers called duces limitis ("border commanders"). Some 20 duces may have been created under Diocletian. Most duces were given command of forces in a single province, but a few controlled more than one province e.g. the dux Pannoniae I et Norici. However, at higher echelons, military and administrative command remained united in the vicarii and praefecti praetorio. In addition, Diocletian completed {{the exclusion of the}} senatorial class, still dominated by the Italian aristocracy, from all senior military commands <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>all</b> top administrative posts except in Italy.|$|E
