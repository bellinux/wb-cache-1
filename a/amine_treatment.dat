Aldehyde dehydrogenase was the predominant enzyme involved in phenylacetaldehyde oxidation and thus it has a major role in 2 -phenylethylamine metabolism with aldehyde oxidase playing a less prominent role. Xanthine oxidase does not contribute to the oxidation of phenylacetaldehyde due to low amounts being present in guinea pig.

These polymers were prepared by either reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) or nitroxide mediated radical polymerization (NMP) starting from a stable, readily available styrenic thiolactone monomer (St-TLa). Successful copolymerization {{of the latter}} with styrene (St) or methyl methacrylate (MMA) yielded linear polymers with varying thiolactone content (4 - 25 %).

30|$|It is {{important}} to know that carbon nanotubes (CNTs) usually are agglomerates of several hundred micrometers in size (Wang et al. 2003). These entanglements cause nanotubes to disperse in polymer matrix difficultly. Therefore, it is essential that alter the chemical nature of the nanotube surface. Solution processing has been performed {{in the construction of the}} well-dispersed carbon nanotube composites. Nevertheless, it is difficult to attain homogeneous dispersion of nanotubes in polymer matrix, owing to the fact that carbon nanotubes are bundled and insoluble. Chemical functionalization of the CNT surface raises interfacial interaction between CNTs and the polymer matrix, increases adhesion of them in different polymers and organic solvents, decreases agglomeration, and improves dispersion (Andrews and Weisenberger 2004). The enhanced interactions between CNTs and the polymer matrix improve the load transfer from the polymer to the nanotubes. Acid treatment of the nanotube is an important technique to chemical functionalization. It produces functional groups on sidewalls or open ends of nanotubes, removes catalytic impurities, and simplifies dispersion of CNTs in various solutions or melts.

40|$|Hydrophobic {{microporous}} membranes {{have been}} widely used in water and wastewater treatment by microfiltration, ultrafiltration and membrane distillation. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) materials {{are one of the most}} popular polymeric membrane materials because of their high mechanical strength, excellent thermal and chemical stabilities, and ease of fabrication into asymmetric hollow fiber membranes. In this work, specialty PVDF materials (Kynar 741, 761, 461, 2851, RC- 10186 and RC 10214) newly developed by Arkema Inc. were used to develop hollow fiber membranes via the dry/wet phase inversion. These materials were evaluated from thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives. The thermodynamic analysis was performed by measuring the cloud points of the PVDF solution systems. The experimental results showed that the thermodynamic stability of the PVDF solution system was affected by the type of polymer and the addition of additive (LiCl); and the effects of the additive (LiCl) depended on the type of polymer. The kinetic experiments were carried out by determining the solvent evaporation rate in the “dry” step and the small molecules (solvent, additive) diffusion rate in the “wet step”. Solvent evaporation in the early stage could be expressed quantitatively. In the “wet” step, the concentrations of solvent and additive had a linear relationship with respect to the square root of time (t 1 / 2) at the early stage of polymer precipitation, indicating that the mass-transfer for solvent-nonsolvent exchange and additive LiCl leaching was diffusion controlled. The kinetic analysis also showed that the slope of this linear relationship could be used as an index to evaluate the polymer precipitation rate (solvent-nonsolvent exchange rate and LiCl leaching rate). The extrusion of hollow fiber membranes was explored, and the effects of various fabrication parameters (such as dope extrusion rate, internal coagulant flow velocity and take-up speed) on the structure and morphology of the hollow fiber membranes were also investigated. The properties of the hollow fiber membranes were characterized by gas permeation method and gas-liquid displacement method. The morphology of the hollow fibers was examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM). It was found that Kynar 741 and 2851 were the best among the PVDF polymers studied here for the fabrication of hollow fiber membranes. In order to reduce the problems associated with the hydrophobicity of PVDF on hollow fiber module assembly, such as tubesheet leaking through problem and fouling problem, <b>amine</b> <b>treatment</b> was used to modify PVDF membranes. Contact angle measurements and filtration experiments were performed. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDAX) were used to analyze the modified polymer.

Hollow fiber membranes fabricated from Kynar 741 were tested for water desalination by vacuum membrane distillation (VMD). An increase in temperature would increase the water productivity remarkably.

The permeate pressure build-up was also investigated by experiments and parametric analysis, and the results will be important to the design of hollow fiber modules for VMD in water desalination...|$|E

Chemical modifications of AT are done through <b>amine</b> <b>treatment</b> {{as well as}} by amine+silane treatment to get chemically modified fillers AAT and SAT respectively. In the present investigation, nano composites are prepared using natural rubber (NR) filled with AT, AAT and SAT. Three different loadings of each filler are used namely 2. 5, 5, and 10 phr (parts per hundred of rubber). Mechanical properties like tensile strength, elongation at break increase with the increase in filler loading up to 5 phr there after these properties marginally fall when loading is increased to 10 phr due to problem of filler dispersion at higher loading. However, modulus at 300 % elongation and tear strength increases with the increase in filler loading up to 10 phr. Very similar trend can also be observed for composites with chemically modified fillers, AAT and SAT. But the degree of reinforcement is higher in the case of AAT and SAT compared to that of unmodified filler AT for the same filler loading. This difference is mainly due to better polymer-filler interaction and filler dispersion in the case of chemically modified clays AAT and SAT compared to unmodified AT. Tear strength of composites increases remarkably with the addition of AT and which is further enhanced when chemically modified clays AAT and SAT are added.

The use of an <b>amine</b> <b>treatment</b> system for postcombustion CO 2 capture brings additional challenges {{in terms of the}} flue gas quality, flue gas composition, operating conditions, scale of operation, and so forth. These differences are expected to {{have a significant impact on}} the overall well-being of the plant and the maintenance strategy over its lifetime. The degradation of solvent, by oxidative and thermal degradation pathways, leads to the formation of various degradation products which are known to be corrosive. The oxidative degradation of amine leads to the formation of ammonia which can be emitted to the atmosphere in the treated flue gas stream. This study aims at verifying the interrelation between (1) solvent degradation, (2) corrosion, and (3) NH 3 emissions, based on two test campaigns of over 1500 operating hours, in a CO 2 capture pilot plant. An online tool for real-time corrosion monitoring, SmartCET, is presented and compared with offline corrosion coupon. The different process and operating conditions such as the change in the flue gas composition, start-up and shutdown, and solvent replacement were correlated with the variations in the corrosion parameters (general corrosion rate, pitting factor, and corrosion mechanism indicator (CMI)), for both campaigns. The three parameters showed only a small increase for most part of both the campaigns (> 75 days), and followed a similar trend. However, during both the campaigns, a rapid increase of all the three parameters was observed. In one of the campaigns, the three parameters increased by about 2 orders of magnitude in a time period of only about 20 days, which points toward an autocatalytic out of control solvent chemistry. The common characteristic before the onset of autocatalytic solvent chemistry, is the re-start-up of the pilot plant after an extended period of shutdown. On the basis of these tests, the use of an online corrosion monitoring tool will enable long-term steady state operation of a full scale postcombustion CO 2 capture plant...|$|E
40|$|In {{the male}} moth, Agrotis ipsilon, mating induces a {{transient}} inhibition of behavioural and central nervous responses to sex pheromone. Newly mated males are not attracted to sex pheromone, and {{the sensitivity of}} their antennal lobe (AL) neurons is lower than in virgin males. This rapid transient olfactory inhibition prevents them from re-mating unsuccessfully until they have refilled their sex glands. We hypothesized that this olfactory ‘switch off’ might be controlled by neuromodulators such as biogenic amines. To test our hypothesis, we studied the effects of octopamine (OA) and serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT) on the coding properties of pheromone-sensitive AL neurons in virgin and newly mated males. We show that AL neuron sensitivity increased in newly mated males after injection of OA or 5 -HT, but only OA treatment affected certain response characteristics of AL neurons in virgin males. Whereas all measured AL neuron response characteristics were different between virgin and newly mated males, <b>amine</b> <b>treatment</b> in newly mated males restored only the latency and spike frequency, but not the duration of excitatory and inhibitory phases, which were initially found in virgin males. Additionally, we investigated the behavioural effects of OA and 5 -HT treatments in virgin and mated males. Although OA and 5 -HT enhanced the general flight activity of newly mated males, amine treatments did not restore the behavioural pheromone response of mated moths. Altogether, these results show that, although biogenic amines modulate the olfactory system in moths, OA and 5 -HT are probably {{not involved in the}} post-mating inhibition of responses to sex pheromone in A. ipsilon males.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of the work done so far on the synthesis and reactions of monosaccharide epoxides has been on the aldoses. Some ketoses have therefore been studied. The work falls into 3 partsThe known compound 1, 2 - 0 -isopropylidene- 3, 4 -anhydro-beta-D-psicopyranose has been made from fructose. Synthesis of methyl 1, 3 - 0 -benzylidene- 4, 5 -anhydro-a-L-psicoside and methyl 1, 3 - 0 -benzylid-ene- 4, 5 -anhydro-beta-D-fructoside from L-sorbose was attempted. Conformational factors prevented the formation of either of these 4, 5 -anhydro-compounds. b) In the absence of any entirely satisfactorymethod of cyanating sugars, an attempt has been made to develop one. Two methods were used: i) Potassium cyanide in acetonitrile, with 18 -crown- 6 as phase transfer catalyst. ii) Tetra-n-butylammonium cyanide in a variety of dipolar aprotic solvents. Methyl 2, 3 -anhydro- 4, 6 - 0 -benzylidene-a-D-mannoside and 1, 2 - 0 -isopropylidene- 3, 4 -anhydro-B-D-psicose were the starting materials. The crown ether was found to be ineffective as a phase transfer catalyst. No cyano-sugars were obtained using the second method, but some reactions produced lactones. Tetra-n-butylammonium cyanide was unstable even at temperatures as low as 100 °C. Ring-opening of 1, 2 - 0 -isopropylidene- 3, 4 -anhydro- 5 " 0 -benzoyl-(3 -D-psicose was carried out with sodium azide to give the 4 -azido-sorboside. Reduction of the mesyl derivative of this with Raney nickel gave the <b>amine.</b> <b>Treatment</b> with sodium methoxide gave a benzamido- compound. Some oxazoline may also have been formed. Reduction of the 3 -mesyl- 4 -azido-sorboside with lithium aluminium hydride gave a mixture of the amine and an unknown substance which gave, after acetylation, 1, 2 - 0 -isopropylidene- 3 -dideoxy- 4 -deoxy- 4 -acetamido- 5 - 0 -acetyl-beta-D-sorbopyranose. Thin layer chromatography suggested the presence of a little of the 3 -acetamido- compound. In both cases there are conformational reasons for failure to produce an epimine. In previous reports of synthesis of epimines from azides, the intermediate amine has not been isolated. Apart from the epoxide used as starting material, none of the other compounds has been reported in the literature before. <p...|$|E
40|$|Winning an agonistic {{interaction}} {{against a}} conspecific {{is known to}} heighten aggressiveness, but the underlying events and mechanism are poorly understood. We quantified the effect of experiencing successive wins on aggression in adult male crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) by staging knockout tournaments and investigated its dependence on biogenic <b>amines</b> by <b>treatment</b> with <b>amine</b> receptor antagonists. For an inter-fight interval of 5 min, fights between winners escalated {{to higher levels of}} aggression and lasted significantly longer than the preceding round. This winner effect is transient, and no longer evident for an inter-fight interval of 20 min, indicating that it does not result from selecting individuals that were hyperaggressive from the outset. A winner effect was also evident in crickets that experienced wins without physical exertion, or that engaged in fights that were interrupted before a win was experienced. Finally, the winner effect was abolished by prior treatment with epinastine, a highly selective octopamine receptor blocker, but not by propranolol, a ß-adrenergic receptor antagonist, nor by yohimbine, an insect tyramine receptor blocker nor by fluphenazine an insect dopamine-receptor blocker. Taken together our study in the cricket indicates that the physical exertion of fighting, together with some rewarding aspect of the actual winning experience, leads to a transient increase in aggressive motivation via activation o...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} novel nonfouling {{passivation}} method using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) engraftment on {{the surfaces of}} poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfluidic devices sealed with SU- 8. To achieve bonding between the PDMS and SU- 8 surfaces, the PDMS surface was first functionalized with <b>amines</b> by <b>treatment</b> with 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) for subsequent reaction with epoxide functional groups on SU- 8 surfaces. To modify the heterogeneous surfaces of the resulting PDMS/SU- 8 microfluidic device further, the remaining SU- 8 surfaces were amino functionalized using ethylene diamine (EDA), followed by treating both amino-functionalized PDMS and SU- 8 surfaces with mPEG-NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) through an amine-NHS reaction for facile PEG immobilizations, thus simultaneously modifying both PDMS and SU- 8 surfaces in one reaction. Detailed surface analyses such as the water contact angle, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were conducted to confirm the chemical reactions and characterize the resulting surface properties. To test the efficacy of this surface-modification strategy, we conducted nonspecific protein and particle binding tests using microfluidic devices with and without modifications. The PEG-modified PDMS/SU- 8 device surfaces showed a 64. 5 % reduction in nonspecific bovine serum albumin (BSA) adsorption in comparison {{to that of the}} unmodified surfaces and 92. 0 and 95. 8 % reductions in microbead adhesion under both stagnant and flowing conditions, respectively.

40|$|Amine {{fungicides}} {{are widely}} used as crop protectants. Their success {{is believed to be}} related to their ability to inhibit postlanosterol sterol biosynthesis in fungi, in particular sterol- 18, 17 -isomerases and sterol- 114 -reductases, with a concomitant accumulation of toxic abnormal sterols. However, their actual cellular effects and mechanisms of death induction are still poorly understood. Paradoxically, plants exhibit a natural resistance to amine fungicides although they have similar enzymes in postcicloartenol sterol biosynthesis that are also susceptible to fungicide inhibition. A major difference in vacuolar ion homeostasis between plants and fungi is the presence of a dual set of primary proton pumps in the former (V-ATPase and HC-pyrophosphatase), but only the V-ATPase in the latter. Abnormal sterols affect the proton-pumping capacity of V-ATPases in fungi and this has been proposed as a major determinant in fungicide action. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model fungus, we provide evidence that <b>amine</b> fungicide <b>treatment</b> induced cell death by apoptosis. Cell death was concomitant with impaired HC-pumping capacity in vacuole vesicles and dependent on vacuolar proteases. Also, the heterologous expression of the Arabidopsis thaliana main HC- pyrophosphatase (AVP 1) at the fungal vacuolar membrane reduced apoptosis levels in yeast and increased resistance to amine fungicides. Consistently, A. thaliana avp 1 mutant seedlings showed increased susceptibility to this amine fungicide, particularly at the level of root development. This is in agreement with AVP 1 being nearly the sole HC-pyrophosphatase gene expressed at the root elongation zones. All in all, the present data suggest that HC-pyrophosphatases are major determinants of plant tolerance to amine fungicidesPeer reviewe...|$|R
