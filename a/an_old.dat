40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} if having <b>an</b> <b>older</b> sibling {{was significantly related}} to stronger selfregulation and achievement, in a sample of 74 preschool children participating in a selfregulation intervention. It was hypothesized that children with <b>an</b> <b>older</b> sibling in the fall would have higher self-regulation and achievement scores than children with no older siblings, and that children with <b>an</b> <b>older</b> sibling in the intervention would improve more across the year in selfregulation and achievement than children with <b>an</b> <b>older</b> sibling in the control group. Results showed that having <b>an</b> <b>older</b> sibling significantly predicted higher vocabulary and math scores in the fall of preschool. In addition, children with <b>an</b> <b>older</b> sibling in the intervention group had significantly higher vocabulary scores than children with <b>an</b> <b>older</b> sibling in the control group in the spring. Findings indicate that <b>older</b> siblings have <b>an</b> important influence on the early development of vocabulary skills in preschool children...|$|R
