2500|$|Although {{this might}} have just been dirty talk, a similar {{continuity}} error exists regarding the rank of Mack Gerhardt. In the season-one episode [...] "True Believers", his wife says to him [...] "come here sergeant major, <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> report", but his rank is later established as master sergeant.

2500|$|In 1930, Davis {{moved to}} Hollywood to screen test for Universal Studios. Davis {{and her mother}} {{traveled}} by train to Hollywood and arrived on December 13, 1930. She later recounted her surprise that nobody from the studio was there to meet her at the train. [...] In fact, a studio employee had waited for her, but left because he saw nobody who [...] "looked like an actress". She failed her first screen test, but was used in several screen tests for other actors.

They laid me on a couch, and I tested fifteen men...They all had to lie {{on top of me}} <b>and</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> passionate kiss. Oh, I thought I would die. Just thought I would die." [...] A second test was arranged for Davis, for the 1931 film A House Divided. Hastily dressed in an ill-fitting costume with a low neckline, she was rebuffed by the director William Wyler, who loudly commented to the assembled crew, [...] "What do you think of these dames who show their chests and think they can get jobs?" ...|$|E
