5|$|Despite the game's {{expanded}} memory resources, reviewers {{felt that the}} game's visuals were only marginally—if at all—better than for contemporary games, such as the previous year's Banjo-Kazooie. In fact, IGN felt that Donkey Kong 64 was not <b>as</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>as</b> Banjo-Kazooie, especially in its water and backgrounds, though it still ranked among the console's prettiest games. The setting is barren and nondescript at first, and only later introduces lighting effects and richer textures. IGN hoped for more from Rare, and while its reviewer praised the game's particle effects (e.g., in the desert wind), he considered the game's dynamic lighting overused. N64 Magazine said that the enhanced effects were most often used for decoration, though they also played some role in puzzles based on illuminating paths. Reviewers noted graphical difficulties even with the extra memory, such as frame rate slowdowns and distant features not appearing in any detail, though overall they considered the added graphical flourishes commendable. GameSpot also saw a lack of variety in the game's environment.|$|E

Loma Linda is certainly in keeping with what its name implies--Hill Beautiful. It is located in an ideal spot, and, in my opinion, is <b>as</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>as</b> pictured. To receive a training there must be deemed a privilege. The advantages and opportunities are excellent, and come up to one's expectations.|$|E
2500|$|Christina abdicated her throne on 6 June 1654 {{in favor}} of her cousin Charles Gustav. During the abdication {{ceremony}} at Uppsala Castle, Christina wore her regalia, which were ceremonially removed from her, one by one. Per Brahe, {{who was supposed to}} remove the crown, did not move, so she had to take the crown off herself. Dressed in a simple white taffeta gown, she gave her farewell speech with a faltering voice, thanked everyone and left the throne to Charles X Gustav, who was dressed in black. Per Brahe felt that she [...] "stood there <b>as</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>as</b> an angel." [...] Charles Gustav was crowned later on that day. Christina left the country within a few days.|$|E

2500|$|She {{received}} her first name, which {{was taken from}} the Greek word for [...] "peace," [...] because she was born {{at the end of the}} Austro-Prussian War. Alice considered Irene an unattractive child and once wrote to her sister Victoria that Irene was [...] "not pretty." [...] Though not <b>as</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>as</b> her sister Elizabeth, Irene did have a pleasant, even disposition. Princess Alice brought up her daughters simply. An English nanny presided over the nursery and the children ate plain meals of rice puddings and baked apples and wore plain dresses. Her daughters were taught how to do housework, such as baking cakes, making their own beds, laying fires and sweeping and dusting their rooms. Princess Alice also emphasized the need to give to the poor and often took her daughters on visits to hospitals and charities.|$|E

When he asks his aunt and uncle if they wouldd like to see them, his uncle asks, [...] "Have you got any of Norma Talmadge?" [...] Apparently the uncle's attraction to Norma Talmadge is a sore spot in the marriage, because Aunt Lottie (played by Eve Arden) goes on a rant about Norma Talmadge being a Catholic. She says, [...] "Norma Talmadge! Norma Talmadge! That's all I hear, is 'Norma Talmadge'!

2500|$|In the United States, the Virgin marketed version omitted {{two songs}} ("Kiss Your Feet" [...] and [...] "Jesus' Blood") that were {{included}} on the Sparrow version. Each of these contained explicit faith references. Additionally, the album caused some controversy in the US Christian music scene due to the lyric [...] "she's <b>as</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>as</b> hell" [...] in the song [...] "It's OK". The band had left the song off promotional copies of the album, and Sparrow Records had considered leaving the song off the album; several Christian retailers dropped the album amongst the complaints. Smith wrote {{a response to the}} controversy on the band's website; however, many fans continued to believe that the band had left Christian rock for the secular industry. The band also received criticism for the lack of the word [...] "Jesus" [...] on the album. [...] "We recognise the ultimate validity of the criticisms leveled against us," [...] responded lead singer Martin Smith, [...] "and we feel as a band that this just speaks to the spiritual and intellectual maturity of our listening audience and Christians in general, for that matter." ...|$|E
