5|$|The National Safety Council, {{a nonprofit}} safety <b>advocacy</b> <b>group,</b> {{estimates}} U.S. motor vehicle deaths in 2016 were 40,200, a 14 {{percent increase from}} its 2014 estimate. The National Safety Council measures roadside deaths differently than U.S. government agencies. The National Safety Council counts traffic and non-traffic deaths within one year of an accident while the government counts only traffic deaths occurring within 30 days of a crash. The National Safety Council's statistics show {{that the increase in}} 2016 was due only in part to increased miles driven (due to population growth, low gasoline prices, and a strengthening economy.) The National Safety Council suggests the increase in deaths not explained by increased vehicle miles is attributable to complacency about impaired driving and increased driver distraction.|$|E
