5|$|In the {{mathematical}} field of algebraic topology, the homotopy groups of spheres describe how spheres of various dimensions can wrap around each other. They {{are examples of}} topological invariants, which reflect, in algebraic terms, the structure of spheres viewed as topological spaces, forgetting about their precise geometry. Unlike homology groups, which are also topological invariants, the homotopy groups <b>are</b> <b>surprisingly</b> complex and difficult to compute.|$|E
5|$|The {{homology}} groups H'i(S'n), with i > n, are all trivial. It therefore {{came as a}} {{great surprise}} historically that the corresponding homotopy groups are not trivial in general. This {{is the case that}} is of real importance: the higher homotopy groups πi(S'n), for i > n, <b>are</b> <b>surprisingly</b> complex and difficult to compute, and the effort to compute them has generated a significant amount of new mathematics.|$|E
5|$|These costs <b>are</b> <b>surprisingly</b> high—one {{agent who}} {{represents}} an unnamed NBA player set to earn $10 {{million in the}} 2010–11 season said the player had received a $400,000 quote to insure his contract for his national team's FIBA qualifier. The Spanish Basketball Federation said that insuring all the NBA players on its national team for EuroBasket 2011, which doubles as the European Olympic qualifiers, could {{cost as much as}} $5.67 million. Basketball Australia announced that Andrew Bogut would not be available for the 2011 FIBA Oceania Championship; his agent indicated that the final deal-breaker was when insurers stated that they would not insure his remaining $39 million in NBA salary unless pre-existing elbow, wrist, and back injuries were excluded from the policy.|$|E

25|$|Quiescent {{current in}} a {{regulator}} circuit {{is the current}} drawn internally, not available to the load, normally measured as the input current while no load is connected and hence a source of inefficiency (some linear regulators <b>are,</b> <b>surprisingly,</b> more efficient at very low current loads than switch-mode designs because of this).|$|E
25|$|Italy has {{the richest}} {{concentration}} of Late Antique and medieval mosaics in the world. Although {{the technique is}} especially associated with Byzantine art, and many Italian mosaics were probably made by imported Greek-speaking artists and craftsmen, the numbers of significant mosaics remaining in the core Byzantine territories <b>are</b> <b>surprisingly</b> few. This {{is especially true for}} the centuries before the Byzantine Iconoclasm of the 8th century.|$|E

25|$|The oldest {{definitive}} Eucalyptus fossils <b>are</b> <b>surprisingly</b> from South America, where eucalypts are {{no longer}} endemic, though have been introduced from Australia. The fossils are from the early Eocene (51.9 Mya), and {{were found in the}} Laguna del Hunco deposit in Chubut province in Argentina. This shows that the genus had a Gondwanan distribution. Fossil leaves also occur in the Miocene of New Zealand, where the genus is not native today, but again have been introduced from Australia.|$|E
25|$|The {{smallest}} modification to the Standard Model, {{which only}} has left-handed neutrinos, {{is to allow}} these left-handed neutrinos to have Majorana masses. The problem with {{this is that the}} neutrino masses <b>are</b> <b>surprisingly</b> smaller {{than the rest of the}} known particles (at least 500,000 times smaller than the mass of an electron), which, while it does not invalidate the theory, is widely regarded as unsatisfactory as this construction offers no insight into the origin of the neutrino mass scale.|$|E

25|$|Bison are nomadic grazers, {{wandering}} high on Yellowstone's grassy plateaus in summer. Despite their slow gait, bison <b>are</b> <b>surprisingly</b> {{fast for}} animals that {{weigh more than}} half a ton. In winter, they use their large heads like a plow to push aside snow and find winter food. In the park interior where snows are deep, they winter in thermally influenced areas and around the geyser basins. Bison also move to winter range {{in the northern part of}} Yellowstone.|$|E
25|$|The several sets of arias with {{variations}} <b>are,</b> <b>surprisingly,</b> {{much more}} developed than the organ chorale variations. BuxWV 250 La Capricciosa may have inspired Bach's Goldberg Variations BWV 988: both have 32 variations (including the two arias of the Goldberg Variations); {{there are a}} number of similarities in the structure of individual movements; both include variations in forms of various dances; both are in G major; and Bach was familiar with Buxtehude's work and admired him, as has been related above.|$|E
25|$|Epicurus' teachings were {{introduced}} into medical philosophy and practice by the Epicurean doctor Asclepiades of Bithynia, {{who was the}} first physician who introduced Greek medicine in Rome. Asclepiades introduced the friendly, sympathetic, pleasing and painless treatment of patients. He advocated humane treatment of mental disorders, had insane persons freed from confinement and treated them with natural therapy, such as diet and massages. His teachings <b>are</b> <b>surprisingly</b> modern, therefore Asclepiades {{is considered to be a}} pioneer physician in psychotherapy, physical therapy and molecular medicine.|$|E

25|$|The {{classic example}} is the ear {{ossicles}} of mammals, which we know from paleontological and embryological studies originated in {{the upper and lower}} jaws and the hyoid bone of their synapsid ancestors, and further back still were part of the gill arches of early fish. We owe this esoteric knowledge to the comparative anatomists, who, a century ago, were {{at the cutting edge of}} evolutionary studies. The word exaptation was coined to cover these shifts in function, which <b>are</b> <b>surprisingly</b> common in evolutionary history. The origin of wings from feathers that were originally used for temperature regulation is a more recent discovery (see feathered dinosaurs).|$|E
25|$|Associated {{with the}} monastery {{is a series}} of 26 chapels, which were located in places were pre-Hispanic rituals had been {{performed}} as part of the “spiritual conquest” of the area. Some of these chapels have been abandoned and are in ruins. Eighteen remain in use and are being gradually restored. These chapels are divided into three groups, capillas de cabecera, capillas de calpulli and capillas de relación. While some are simple, even humble structures, several of the chapels <b>are</b> <b>surprisingly</b> elaborated with decorative facades, towers, espadañas and decorative gateways, some dating from colonial times. Each of the chapels has its own feast day and each neighborhood has its own chapel.|$|E
25|$|Cretaceous fairyflies {{are much}} rarer. In 1975, Carl M. Yoshimoto {{described}} four genera of fairyflies from the Cretaceous of Canada. In 2011, John T. Huber and George Poinar, Jr. described the genus Myanmymar from Burmese amber. Dating {{back to the}} Upper Albian age (about 100 mya) of the Early Cretaceous, it is the oldest known fairyfly (and chalcid wasp). They <b>are</b> <b>surprisingly</b> very similar to modern genera, though with {{a greater number of}} flagellar segments and longer forewing veins. The characteristics of the fossil (taking into account Yoshimoto's earlier discoveries) led them to conclude fairfylies either may have existed much earlier than Myanmymar, or they may have diversified rapidly during that time period.|$|E
