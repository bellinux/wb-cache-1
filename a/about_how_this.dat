5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{question the}} poet's sexuality, theorizing that the numerous letters and poems that were dedicated to Susan Gilbert Dickinson indicate a lesbian romance, and speculating <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> {{may have influenced}} her poetry. Critics such as John Cody, Lillian Faderman, Vivian R. Pollak, Paula Bennett, Judith Farr, Ellen Louise Hart, and Martha Nell Smith have argued that Susan was the central erotic relationship in Dickinson's life.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the continents}} of North and South America are moving westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have {{produced}} several scenarios <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> {{will continue in}} the future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific ocean remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Birmingham in Britain, the Australian {{physicist}} Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists— Frisch and Rudolf Peierls—the task {{of investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} an atomic bomb, ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium-235 was within {{an order of magnitude}} of 10kg, which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. Research into how uranium isotope separation (uranium enrichment) could be achieved assumed enormous importance. Frisch's first thought <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> could be achieved was with liquid thermal diffusion.|$|E

Conservative Jews teach that God created the universe and is responsible for the creation of life within it, but proclaims no mandatory teachings <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> occurs.|$|E

At this insistence Hilde finds herself telling Hannes' secret to her mother. The story is vague <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> information is relayed to Pesendorfer, but, he finds and kills the prisoner, then takes Hannes away to beat him for his misconduct. Hilde recalls cleaning the blood from her brother's face after the beating. The following day, she finds that Hannes has been hanged for his actions.

25|$|At work, Cindy {{searches}} through {{pictures of}} lighthouses before finding {{the one from}} the tape. Desperate to save Cody, Cindy warns everyone by entering a message into the news anchor's teleprompter. Her boss interrupts her, and the anchor mechanically recites the wrong message. The Logans take it seriously since they encountered an alien disguised as Michael Jackson, and President Baxter Harris personally visits the farm to investigate the crop circles. Cindy visits the lighthouse, where she encounters The Architect. The loquacious (and lecherous) old man explains Tabitha was his evil adopted daughter, whom his wife drowned in the farm's well, but not before she imprinted her evil onto the tape. Unfortunately, he mistakenly returned it to Blockbuster, unleashing the curse. When Cindy asks <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> relates to the Aliens, the Architect speculates that Tabitha is summoning them to aid her in destroying the human race.|$|E
25|$|On November 18, 2010, id Software {{released}} {{the game for}} iOS devices as a demo for showcasing its gameplay. The HD version of the game called Rage HD was released for all iOS devices. John Carmack hinted {{that he intends to}} release another iPhone app based on the Rage universe that focuses on the racing aspect of the game. On March 11, 2011, Bethesda and Dark Horse Comics announced a three-issue comic book series based on Rage. The original miniseries was written by Arvid Nelson, and penciled by Andrea Mutti. The cover art is being created by Glenn Fabry. The comic series, developed with the direct participation of Rages creative director, Tim Willits, presents a new twist on the post-apocalyptic near future as one woman discovers that the survival of humankind does not necessarily mean the survival of humanity. The Earth has been devastated by a collision with an asteroid, with {{a tiny fraction of the}} population surviving in life-sustaining Arks buried deep below its surface. Those who survive emerge to find a wasteland controlled by a global military dictatorship called the Authority. But a rescued scientist learns that the Authority has lied to her and the other survivors <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> new world came to be. On March 30, 2011, Bethesda announced that they would team up with Del Rey Books to create a novel based on Rage. The novel was written by Matthew J. Costello, also responsible for the video game. It was released on August 30, 2011.|$|E

500|$|Though {{there was}} {{agreement}} that separate para-church [...] "missionary societies" [...] could not be established (on the belief that such work could only be performed through local congregations), a doctrinal conflict ensued <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> work was to be done.

500|$|Much of the {{scholarly}} {{discussion of the}} poem has concerned {{the difference between the}} endings of the Tithonus poem preserved in the two papyri. Scholars disagree <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> should be interpreted. [...] André Lardinois lists possible explanations which have been put forward: firstly that the Cologne papyrus did not contain the full poem, but only the first twelve lines; secondly that the poem does end after line twelve and the final lines on the Oxyrhynchus papyrus were part of another poem; and thirdly that there were two different endings for the poem, one at line twelve and one continuing on to line sixteen.|$|E
500|$|The fall of Poland was {{followed}} by what contemporary journalists dubbed the [...] "Phoney War" [...] or Sitzkrieg ("sitting war"). Hitler instructed the two newly appointed Gauleiters of north-western Poland, Albert Forster of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia and Arthur Greiser of Reichsgau Wartheland, to Germanise their areas, with [...] "no questions asked" [...] <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> was accomplished. In Forster's area, ethnic Poles merely had to sign forms stating that they had German blood. In contrast, Greiser agreed with Himmler and carried out an ethnic cleansing campaign towards Poles. Greiser soon complained that Forster was allowing thousands of Poles to be accepted as [...] "racial" [...] Germans and thus endangered German [...] "racial purity". Hitler refrained from getting involved. This inaction has been advanced {{as an example of}} the theory of [...] "working towards the Führer", in which Hitler issued vague instructions and expected his subordinates to work out policies on their own.|$|E
500|$|Many New Agers {{advocate}} globalisation and localisation, but reject {{nationalism and}} the role of the nation-state. Some New Age spokespeople have called for greater decentralisation and global unity, but are vague <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> might be achieved; others call for a global, centralised government. Satin for example argued for a move away from the nation-state and towards self-governing regions which, through improved global communication networks, would help engender world unity. Benjamin Creme conversely argued that [...] "the Christ," [...] a great Avatar, Maitreya, the World Teacher, expected by all the major religions as their [...] "Awaited One," [...] would return to the world and establish a strong, centralised global government in the form of the United Nations; this would be politically re-organised along a spiritual hierarchy. Kyle observed that New Agers often speak favourably of democracy and citizens' involvement in policy making but are critical of representative democracy and majority rule, thus displaying elitist ideas to their thinking.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} the first to feature flashbacks with Sayid, an Arab character. The {{producers}} knew they had to tread carefully with the character due to possible prejudices against Arabs. The actor, Naveen Andrews, said, [...] "we were all pretty nervous, {{in the sense that we}} all felt we owed a real obligation, not just to Iraqis but the entire Arab world <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> character would be played." [...] In an early draft of [...] "Solitary", Rousseau told Sayid that she and her research team were studying time. When ABC saw this draft, they asked the producers to remove this line, explaining that they did not want the show to venture into science fiction during the first season. The character of Sullivan, to whose medical woes Jack tended, was created to make the rest of the survivors think that Rousseau's team was killed by an illness. The idea for Hurley's golf course came from script coordinator Brent Fletcher; it was based on a miniature golf course he created in the offices for the television show Angel.|$|E
500|$|Tourist and {{scientific}} visits to Titanic are still continuing; by April 2012, 100 {{years since the}} disaster and nearly 25 since {{the discovery of the}} wreck, around 140 people had visited. [...] On 14 April 2012 (the 100th anniversary of the ship's sinking), the wreck of the Titanic became eligible for protection under the 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage. In the same month, Robert Ballard, the wreck's discoverer, announced a plan to preserve the wreck of the Titanic by using deep-sea robots to paint the wreck with anti-fouling paint, to help keep the wreck in its current state for all time. The proposed plan that Ballard announced has been outlined in a documentary made to time with the Titanic's 100th sinking anniversary called Save the Titanic With Bob Ballard where Ballard himself talks <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> proposed paint job on the wreck will work. Ballard says that he proposed to robotically clean and repaint the Titanic with a colour scheme mimicking rusticles because he saw [...] "original anti-fouling paint on the ship's hull, which was still working even after 74 years on the seabed" [...] when he visited the Titanic in 1986.|$|E
