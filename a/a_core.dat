5|$|The {{interaction}} {{of stars in}} the collapsed core region causes tight binary systems to form. As other stars interact with these tight binaries, they increase the energy at the core, which causes the cluster to re-expand. As the mean time for <b>a</b> <b>core</b> collapse is typically less than {{the age of the}} galaxy, many of a galaxy's globular clusters may have passed through <b>a</b> <b>core</b> collapse stage, then re-expanded.|$|E

40|$|We {{recall the}} notion of prie modules and use the {{analogue}} technique to define prime comodules and corings. Moreover, the related properties are of interest.

5|$|A {{large number}} of {{chemical}} compounds are known to exhibit one or several liquid crystalline phases. Despite significant differences in chemical composition, these molecules have some common features in chemical and physical properties. There are three types of thermotropic liquid crystals: discotics, bowlics and rod-shaped molecules. Discotics are flat disc-like molecules consisting of <b>a</b> <b>core</b> of adjacent aromatic rings; the core in a bowlic is not flat but like a rice bowl (a three-dimensional object). This allows for two dimensional columnar ordering, for both discotics and bowlics. Rod-shaped molecules have an elongated, anisotropic geometry which allows for preferential alignment along one spatial direction.|$|E

They were finally evicted on 21 June 1995, whereupon, as at Claremont Road, the building was immediately demolished.
