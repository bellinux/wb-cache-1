5|$|One analyst {{reasoned}} the {{recurrence of}} lesbian chic {{was due to}} the often-used homoerotic subtexts of gay male subculture being considered off limits because of AIDS in the late 1980s and 1990s, joined with the distant memory of lesbians as they appeared in the 1970s: unattractive and militant. In short, lesbians became more attractive to general audiences when they ceased having political convictions. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> on feminine and glamorous women created what culture analyst Rodger Streitmatter characterizes as an unrealistic image of lesbians packaged by heterosexual men; the trend influenced an increase in the inclusion of lesbian material in pornography aimed at men.|$|E

The week before Valentine's Day, Apu tells Homer that he is disappointed that Manjula does not love him, until Homer assures him that Manjula will not leave him before Valentine's Day, and Apu agrees. Apu decides to shower Manjula with many romantic surprises to regain her love. However, although many of Apu's surprises succeed in fixing his marriage, they ruin other people's relationships. The rest of Springfield's women become jealous from <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> Manjula is receiving, and find their men to be cheapskates (including Maude Flanders).

Steven then goes into cardiac arrest and dies after being injured in the fire leaving Abi devastated. In an attempt to console Lauren but also partly out of jealousy that Lauren is getting <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention,</b> Abi tries to tell Lauren about her pregnancy, but Lauren angrily mistakes this as gloating about her own abortion.

The engines produced about 500 horsepower each and delivered a speed of between 12 and 13 knots.

Steam was supplied by four vertical tubular boilers with a double row of furnaces, designed by the Line's chief engineer, John Faron.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{can be used}} in cars in two ways: {{a source}} of {{combustible}} heat, or a source of electrons for an electric motor. The burning of hydrogen is not being developed in practical terms; it is the hydrogen fuel-cell electric vehicle (HFEV) which is garnering <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention.</b> Hydrogen fuel cells create electricity fed into an electric motor to drives the wheels. Hydrogen is not burned, but it is consumed. This means molecular hydrogen, H2, is combined with oxygen to form water. 2H2 (4e−) + O2 --> 2H2O (4e−). The molecular hydrogen and oxygen's mutual affinity drives the fuel cell to separate the electrons from the hydrogen, to use them to power the electric motor, and to return them to the ionized water molecules that were formed when the electron-depleted hydrogen combined with the oxygen in the fuel cell. Recalling that a hydrogen atom {{is nothing more than a}} proton and an electron; in essence, the motor is driven by the proton's atomic attraction to the oxygen nucleus, and the electron's attraction to the ionized water molecule.|$|E
