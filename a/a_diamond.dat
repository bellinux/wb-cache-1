5|$|<b>A</b> <b>diamond</b> {{simulant}} is a non-diamond {{material that}} is used to simulate the appearance of <b>a</b> <b>diamond,</b> and may be referred to as diamante. Cubic zirconia is the most common. The gemstone moissanite (silicon carbide) can be treated as <b>a</b> <b>diamond</b> simulant, though more costly to produce than cubic zirconia. Both are produced synthetically.|$|E

25|$|Most {{inclusions}} {{present in}} gem-quality diamonds do {{not affect the}} diamonds' performance or structural integrity and are not {{visible to the naked}} eyes. However, large clouds can affect <b>a</b> <b>diamond's</b> ability to transmit and scatter light. Large cracks close to or breaking the surface may reduce <b>a</b> <b>diamond's</b> resistance to fracture.|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> tight <b>diamond</b> {{interchange}} (TDI), {{also known}} as <b>a</b> compressed <b>diamond</b> interchange or <b>a</b> tight urban <b>diamond</b> interchange (TUDI), is sometimes used in areas where there is insufficient right-of-way for <b>a</b> standard <b>diamond</b> interchange. The pair of intersections where the ramps meet the minor road are closely spaced. This spacing forces the turn lanes for each direction to run beside each other, causing the minor road to be wider {{than it would be}} if it were <b>a</b> standard <b>diamond.</b>|$|R

5|$|According to {{an insert}} in the Lady and the Tramp Diamond Edition release case, Aladdin {{was going to}} be {{released}} on Blu-ray Disc as <b>a</b> <b>Diamond</b> Edition in Spring 2013. Instead, Peter Pan was released on Blu-ray as <b>a</b> <b>Diamond</b> Edition on February 5, 2013 to celebrate its 60th anniversary. A non-Diamond Edition Blu-ray was released in a few select European countries in March 2013. The Belgian edition (released without advertisements, commercials or any kind of fanfare) comes as a 1-disc version with its extras ported over from the Platinum Edition DVD. The same disc was released in the United Kingdom on April 14, 2013. Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on <b>a</b> <b>Diamond</b> Edition Blu-ray on October 13, 2015. The film was released on Digital HD on September 29, 2015. Upon its first week of release on home media in the U.S., the film topped the Blu-ray Disc sales chart and debuted at number 2 at the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales behind the disaster film San Andreas.|$|E
5|$|As {{discussed}} above, any non-pseudoforest graph contains as a subgraph a handcuff, {{figure 8}}, or theta graph; any handcuff or figure 8 graph may be contracted {{to form a}} butterfly graph (five-vertex figure 8), and any theta graph may be contracted to form <b>a</b> <b>diamond</b> graph (four-vertex theta graph), so any non-pseudoforest contains either a butterfly or <b>a</b> <b>diamond</b> as a minor, {{and these are the}} only minor-minimal non-pseudoforest graphs. Thus, a graph is a pseudoforest if and only if it does not have the butterfly or the diamond as a minor. If one forbids only the diamond but not the butterfly, the resulting larger graph family consists of the cactus graphs and disjoint unions of multiple cactus graphs.|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, {{only two}} {{interchanges}} {{of the former}} SR 275 remain: <b>a</b> <b>diamond</b> interchange at Jefferson Boulevard (SR 84) and the split at Business Loop 80 / US 50.|$|E
50|$|Other {{characteristics}} {{also influence}} {{the value and}} appearance of <b>a</b> gem <b>diamond.</b> These include physical characteristics such {{as the presence of}} fluorescence as well as the diamond's source and which gemological institute evaluated the diamond. Cleanliness also dramatically affects <b>a</b> <b>diamond's</b> beauty.|$|R

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>diamond's</b> {{electrical}} conductance is only {{relevant to}} blue or gray-blue stones, because the interstitial boron {{responsible for their}} color also makes them semiconductors.

5|$|Bloeme Emden {{was born}} on 26 July 1926 in Amsterdam in the Netherlands to Emanuel Emden, <b>a</b> <b>diamond</b> cutter and a socialist, and Rosa Emden-DeVries, a seamstress. Her younger sister, Via Roosje, was born 29 May 1932.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds may be etched by laser with marks {{invisible}} to the naked eye. Lazare Kaplan, a US-based company, developed this method. However, whatever is marked on <b>a</b> <b>diamond</b> can readily be removed.|$|E
5|$|Early diamond {{identification}} tests {{included a}} scratch test {{relying on the}} superior hardness of diamond. This test is destructive, as <b>a</b> <b>diamond</b> can scratch another diamond, and is rarely used nowadays. Instead, diamond identification relies on its superior thermal conductivity. Electronic thermal probes are widely used in the gemological centers to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist {{of a pair of}} battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is <b>a</b> <b>diamond,</b> it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds.|$|E

50|$|Blue {{diamonds}} {{are only}} considered rare and valuable {{if they are}} natural. The definition of <b>a</b> natural blue <b>diamond</b> is <b>a</b> blue <b>diamond</b> that was mined with its blue color already present. Since the 1950s, many methods {{have been developed to}} change <b>a</b> <b>diamond’s</b> appearance, including adding color to a colorless stone. These are considered enhanced diamonds and do not have the value or resale value of <b>a</b> natural blue <b>diamond.</b> Enhanced blue diamonds are not bought with the intention of investment or eventual resale. Synthetic blue diamonds have also been made, using the HPHT method.|$|R
