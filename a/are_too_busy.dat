5|$|The Torchwood team {{become aware}} of the bizarre death and realises through CCTV that the gas has taken over Carys. Gwen feels guilty at having caused the man's death, but team leader Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) assures her that {{everybody}} makes mistakes. Gwen also learns that she is the only team member who's in a relationship, as the others <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> working to find time. They later find where Carys lives and arrives there before she could harm a postman. When she tries to escape, Owen traps her using a portable prison cell, much to Jack's chagrin, as he forbids the removal of alien technology from Torchwood's base without his permission.|$|E
25|$|The rivalry {{extends beyond}} sports {{to the annual}} blood drive between the two schools. Students, faculty and fans from the schools band {{together}} {{in an effort to}} collect blood before the holiday season when many <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to give blood. The drive is held from Monday through Friday the week before the football matchup. The University of South Carolina and Clemson University wrapped up their 31st annual blood drive in 2015, resulting in the eighth consecutive win for USC. Carolina now holds a 17–15 lead in the yearly competition.|$|E
25|$|Bunthorne, heartbroken by Patience's rejection, {{has chosen}} to raffle himself off among his lady {{followers}} ("Let the merry cymbals sound"), the proceeds going to charity. The Dragoons interrupt the proceedings, and, led by the Duke, attempt to reason with the ladies ("Your maiden hearts, ah, do not steel"), but the ladies <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> clamouring for tickets to the raffle to listen ("Come walk up"). Just as Bunthorne is handing the bag to the unattractive Jane, ready for the worst, Patience interrupts the proceedings and proposes to unselfishly sacrifice herself by loving the poet ("True Love must single-hearted be"). A delighted Bunthorne accepts immediately, and his followers, their idol lost, return to the Dragoons to whom they are engaged ("I hear the soft note of the echoing voice"). All seems resolved until Grosvenor enters and the ladies, finding him poetic, aesthetic, and far more attractive than Bunthorne, become his partisans instead ("Oh, list while we a love confess"), much {{to the dismay of}} the Dragoons, Patience, Bunthorne and especially Grosvenor himself.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked why}} the {{mechanism}} of unlocking maps and characters - accomplished in previous titles by purchasing them with points or coins won through battle - was removed, the developers apologized, commenting that after long deliberation, they felt that such a mechanic was detrimental to the enjoyment of gamers who <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> {{to take the time}} to unlock all of these things. As a result, they designed this game in a way that allowed players to play any non-story based map they wanted, introducing other mechanics to encourage players to keep playing. The developers commented that Days of Ruin had more strategy than previous entries in the series due to the changes and removals made to the game compared to the other titles.|$|E
500|$|Outside {{mainland}} China, {{a network}} of volunteer [...] "contact persons," [...] regional Falun Dafa Associations and university clubs exists in approximately 70 countries. In most mid- to large-sized cities, Falun Gong practitioners organize regular group meditation or study sessions in which they practice Falun Gong exercises and read (or re-read) Li Hongzhi's writings. The exercise and meditation sessions are described as informal groups of practitioners who gather in public parks—usually in the morning—for one to two hours. Group study sessions typically {{take place in the}} evenings in private residences or university or high school classrooms, and are described by David Ownby as [...] "the closest thing to a regular 'congregational experience'" [...] that Falun Gong offers. Individuals who <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy,</b> isolated, or who simply prefer solitude may elect to practice privately.|$|E
500|$|Lawrence Brown wrote: [...] "Spielberg's {{decision}} {{to present the}} invaders' fighting machines as having been there all along, buried deep under the Earth, raises questions which {{did not exist in}} the original Wells book. In Spielberg's version, these invaders had been here before, long ago, in prehistoric times. They had set up their machines deep underground, and departed. Why? Why not take over the Earth right there and then? Spielberg does not provide an answer, and the characters <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> surviving to wonder about this. An answer suggests itself - a very chilling answer. The invaders were interested in humans as food animals. When they came here before, humans were very scarce. The aliens left their hidden machines and departed, patiently observing the Earth until humans would multiply to the requisite numbers - and then they came back, to take over. Under this interpretation, all of us - all humans over the whole of history - have been livestock living in an alien food farm, destined to be 'harvested'".|$|E

2500|$|... is a 1953 Japanese drama film {{directed}} by Yasujirō Ozu and starring Chishū Ryū and Chieko Higashiyama. It {{tells the story}} of an aging couple who travel to Tokyo to visit their grown children.

2500|$|This {{will usually}} mean that turning traffic {{will have to}} stop in order {{to wait for a}} breach to turn, and this might cause {{inconvenience}} for drivers that follow them but do not want to turn. This is why dedicated lanes and protected traffic signals for turning are sometimes provided. On busier intersections where a protected lane would be ineffective or cannot be built, turning may be entirely prohibited, and drivers will be required to [...] "drive around the block" [...] in order to accomplish the turn. Many cities employ this tactic quite often; in San Francisco, due to its common practice, making three right turns is known colloquially as a [...] "San Francisco left turn". Likewise, as many intersections in Taipei City <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to allow direct left turns, signs often direct drivers to drive around the block to turn.|$|E
2500|$|Freeman's {{earliest}} work, titled Operation Greenrun II {{and developed}} as his master's thesis at the University of Colorado, used billboards {{to draw attention}} to a contaminated nuclear production facility at Rocky Flats, Colorado. [...] In this work, eleven billboard faces were created with a message protesting the Rocky Flats site. [...] The ensuing controversy resulted in the decision to shut down Rocky Flats for good. [...] Writing of this project in her book titled Digital Currents: Art in the Electronic Age, Margot Lovejoy says of Freeman that he [...] "believes that a public art can circumvent problems of the gallery system such as the commodification of culture and the perpetuation of an exclusive, elite system for art. [...] He believes in bringing art to the public." [...] She goes on to quote Freeman, who said that [...] "If people <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> to go to the gallery or museum, it makes sense to bring art to them. They don't even {{have to get out of}} their cars." ...|$|E

2500|$|Critic Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{two out of}} four stars, praising the film's visual artistry but stating that there is [...] "no {{narrative}} engine to pull us past the visual scenery", and that he [...] "suspected the filmmakers began {{with a lot of}} ideas about how the movie should look, but without a clue about pacing, plotting or destination." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a rating of A-, saying that the film is a [...] "dazzling reverie of a kids-and-adults movie, an unusual collaboration between lord-of-the-cult multimedia artist Dave McKean and king-of-the-comics Neil Gaiman (The Sandman)" [...] and that it [...] "has something to astonish everyone." [...] Stephen Holden of The New York Times described the film's look as [...] "hazy, indistinct, sepia-tinted, overcrowded and flat", and that [...] "its monochromatic panoramas <b>are</b> <b>too</b> <b>busy</b> and flat to yield an illusion of depth or to convey a feeling of characters moving in space." [...] He {{went on to say that}} the film is [...] "The embodiment of a cult film, one destined for a rich life on home video". Desson Thomson of The Washington Post described the film as [...] "so single-minded in its reach for fantasy, it becomes the genre's evil opposite: banality." ...|$|E
