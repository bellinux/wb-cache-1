5|$|Editing began {{later that}} day, {{with the first}} rough cut {{completed}} on March 18. A version was screened on March 30 for Moore, Peter Lauritson, Dan Curry, J. P.

Cast audio re-recording took place from April 9 onwards depending on the individual actor's availability, supervised by Velazquez.

5|$|In 1960, Danny Greene and his {{childhood}} friends Billy McComber and Art Sneperger are longshoremen at the Cleveland docks. Meanwhile, the members are exploited by corrupt union boss, Jerry Merke {{and the leadership}} of the ILA union urges Greene to run against him. Meanwhile, Sneperger can't pay a gambling debt to Cleveland Mafia Capo John Nardi. In return for Sneperger's debt being forgiven, Greene supplies Nardi's crew with goods stolen from the docks. Merke finds out, demands <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> Greene's profits, and then sends an enforcer to kill him. Instead, Greene beats up the enforcer, then beats up Merke, throws the union leader out of his office, and is later elected union president.

5|$|In addition, the Air Force was {{tasked with}} {{gathering}} intelligence, air reconnaissance, and air transport. Support of ground troops, both doctrinally {{and as a}} practical matter, became marginal. These missions were strongly influenced by a shrinking capability, since its combat aircraft could operate by daylight only, its anti-aircraft artillery was obsolete, and the FLORIDA radar system had reached the limits of operational effectiveness. The retirement of the Hawker Hunters in 1994ended its ground support capability, and <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> one-third from the defence budget meant that plans for a second purchase of F/A-18s and supporting air-to-ground weapons (the reason the multi-capable Hornet was selected) had to be canceled, leaving both it and the F-5s in a strictly air-to-air role.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot {{over a period}} six weeks at the Huntington Hartford Estate, on a small budget.

During the production, Nicol promised the actors <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> the film's ultimate box office earnings, but due to an issue with the film's distributor, this never occurred. During filming, Webber discovered she was pregnant with a son, and so several scenes had to be re-written, like one where she was meant to fall down a staircase.|$|E
5|$|While Concorde had {{initially}} held {{a great deal}} of customer interest, the project was hit by a large number of order cancellations. The Paris Le Bourget air show crash of the competing Soviet Tupolev Tu-144 had shocked potential buyers, and public concern over the environmental issues presented by a supersonic aircraft– the sonic boom, take-off noise and pollution– had produced a shift in public opinion of SSTs. By 1976 four nations remained as prospective buyers: Britain, France, China, and Iran. Only Air France and British Airways (the successor to BOAC) took up their orders, with the two governments taking <b>a</b> <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> any profits made.|$|E
