5|$|With Carltron's defeat, {{the monsters}} plaguing Evermore disappear, {{but the world}} itself grows unstable. The boy returns {{to each of the}} worlds to collect Ruffleberg's companions, taking them back to the real world. In doing so, Evermore's {{destruction}} is averted and it continues to exist without them. After the credits roll, a final scene shows Professor Ruffleberg returning Carltron to his old task of cleaning the lab. Carltron grins <b>and</b> <b>rubs</b> his hands together, implying that he is not as docile as the professor believes.|$|E
25|$|Feeding {{on a human}} {{who carries}} the {{bacterium}} infects the louse. R. prowazekii grows in the louse's gut and is excreted in its feces. The disease is then transmitted to an uninfected human who scratches the louse bite (which itches) <b>and</b> <b>rubs</b> the feces into the wound. The incubation period is one to two weeks. R. prowazekii can remain viable and virulent in the dried louse feces for many days. Typhus will eventually kill the louse, though the disease will remain viable for many weeks in the dead louse.|$|E
500|$|Capricornis crispus is {{socially}} monogamous. [...] Females reach sexual maturity at 30 months. [...] First breeding {{takes place at}} age 2.5â€“3 years; breeding occurs once a year, between September and January. [...] In a courtship ritual resembling that of goats or gazelles, the male Japanese serow licks the female's mouth, strikes her on the hind legs with his forelegs, <b>and</b> <b>rubs</b> her genitalia with his horns. [...] Both sexes display Flehmen responses.|$|E
6000|$|Old Sol looked {{first at}} her, then at his nephew, <b>and</b> then <b>rubbed</b> his hands, <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> his spectacles, <b>and</b> said below his breath, 'Ah! time, time, time!' ...|$|R
50|$|<b>And</b> <b>rub</b> it on {{your back}} and your abdomen.|$|R

500|$|The tale {{opens with}} an {{illustration}} of a wide-eyed kitten: [...] "This is a Pussy called Miss Moppet, she thinks she has heard a mouse!" [...] The following illustration depicts a mouse wearing a pink bowtie and green jacket [...] "peeping out behind the cupboard, and making fun of Miss Moppet. He is not afraid of a kitten." [...] Miss Moppet darts at him, but misses and bumps {{her head on the}} cupboard. She hits the cupboard very hard <b>and</b> <b>rubs</b> her nose. The mouse scurries {{to the top of the}} cupboard and watches her.|$|E
500|$|The three then form a plan, {{which has}} Ed sitting {{alone on a}} bench in the {{playground}} with a [...] "Don't Touch!" [...] sign around his neck. Jonny (David Paul Grove) soon walks by, carrying his imaginary friend Plank, who is a board of wood. Impressed with Ed's hair cut, Jonny ignores the sign <b>and</b> <b>rubs</b> Plank against Ed's head. Eddy and Double D then jump out from behind a nearby bush and capture Jonny, accusing him of being the serial toucher. Eddy interrogates Jonny and Plank after tying them to chairs in Double Dee's garage and hooking them up to a homemade lie detector. However, when they give him no answers, he resorts to using chinese water torture on Plank. This makes Jonny need to use the bathroom and in his desperation, he falsely confesses to the crime. The Eds then collect their money and punish Jonny by trapping him in a tire.|$|E
500|$|Brown depicts Chet's obsessive masturbation, and his {{uncommon}} masturbation {{style has}} drawn notice: he faces down <b>and</b> <b>rubs</b> his penis between {{the palms of}} both hands, a style MarcyR. Isabella likens {{to a pair of}} praying hands. [...] The style has come to be called [...] "the Chester" [...] after a cartoon of it by Peter Bagge. [...] He feels terrified of being caught masturbating and his regret afterwards drives him continually to rid himself of the magazines, such as by hiding them in the woods near his house, but always returns for them. [...] Brown's mother dies while he is at camp, which is mentioned only briefly, as when he returns from camp he immediately heads to the woods to dig up the Playboy he had buried there. [...] Comics critic Darcy Sullivan sees Brown in this scene having [...] "shunted aside his painful feelings for her, and for other women, in favor of this tatty fetish". [...] Chet feels surprised at and repelled by a centrefold of a black Playmate he comes across, bringing about the realization of racist feelings he has.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] said Miss Shott, after {{lifting a}} corner of a blanket <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> <b>and</b> {{pinching}} it, [...] "that these are all wool!" ...|$|R

2500|$|... (Big) Rosie Greenbaum (Carole Ita White) is the girls' {{childhood}} nemesis. She {{married a}} rich doctor <b>and</b> <b>rubs</b> {{this in the}} girls' faces, though they make fun {{of the fact that}} he is a proctologist. She is Laverne's rival and upsets her by calling her a [...] "bimbo". Big Rosie and fellow Milwaukee classmate Terri Buttefuco both return in the season-seven episode [...] "Class of '56".|$|E
60|$|Mr. Guppy sneaks away. Mr. Tulkinghorn, such a foil in his old-fashioned rusty {{black to}} Lady Dedlock's brightness, hands {{her down the}} {{staircase}} to her carriage. He returns rubbing his chin, <b>and</b> <b>rubs</b> it a good deal {{in the course of}} the evening.|$|E
60|$|Pat {{was there}} also, padding about {{from one to}} the other on his black paws, giving us {{friendly}} pokes <b>and</b> <b>rubs.</b> We all made much of him except Felicity, who would not take any notice of him because he was the Story Girl's cat.|$|E
60|$|He chuckled {{to himself}} <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> his long, nervous hands together.|$|R
60|$|Van Brunt shivered <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> {{the backs}} of his hands briskly.|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Guppy takes silent {{notice of}} him at {{intervals}} until he is half way through this second plate and stops to take an enjoying pull at his pint pot of half-and-half (also renewed) and stretches out his legs <b>and</b> <b>rubs</b> his hands. Beholding him in which glow of contentment, Mr. Guppy says, [...] "You are a man again, Tony!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He so washes, <b>and</b> <b>rubs,</b> and scrubs, and smells, and washes, {{that he has}} {{not long}} {{restored}} himself with a glass of brandy and stood silently before the fire when Saint Paul's bell strikes twelve and all those other bells strike twelve from their towers of various heights in the dark air, and in their many tones. When all is quiet again, the lodger says, [...] "It's the appointed time at last. Shall I go?" ...|$|E
60|$|Sophy {{arrives at}} the house of Dora's aunts, in due course. She has the most {{agreeable}} of faces,--not absolutely beautiful, but extraordinarily pleasant,--and {{is one of the most}} genial, unaffected, frank, engaging creatures I have ever seen. Traddles presents her to us with great pride; <b>and</b> <b>rubs</b> his hands for ten minutes by the clock, with every individual hair upon his head standing on tiptoe, when I congratulate him in a corner on his choice.|$|E
25|$|Kerosene <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> alcohol often give {{good results}} when working on aluminium.|$|R
60|$|The King flung {{himself back}} in his chair, <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> his hands.|$|R
60|$|Grant smiled slowly <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> {{his hands}} {{with a kind of}} care.|$|R
60|$|They {{were indeed}} as unsavoury in {{appearance}} {{as they were}} brutal in manner. Water is scarce in the Transvaal, and is used most sparingly for all purposes of cleanliness. The Boer sleeps in his clothes, gives himself a shake when he gets up, and his toilet is completed, unless on very exceptional occasions when he goes outside {{the door to the}} water- cask, fills his hands with water, <b>and</b> <b>rubs</b> them over his face.|$|E
60|$|MRS. MILER. It's {{against the}} rules. But if you'll sit down a moment I'll see what I can do. [She brings forward a chair <b>and</b> <b>rubs</b> {{it with her}} apron. Then {{goes to the door}} of the inner room and speaks through it] A lady to see you. [Returning she removes some {{cigarette}} ends] This is my hour. I shan't make much dust. [Noting CLARE's eyebrows raised at the debris round the armchair] I'm particular about not disturbin' things.|$|E
6000|$|Another {{interruption}} to my letter, {{caused by}} another {{change in the}} weather. The fog has vanished; the waiter is turning off the gas, and letting in the drab-coloured daylight. I ask him if it is still raining. He smiles, <b>and</b> <b>rubs</b> his hands, and says, [...] "It looks like clearing up soon, sir." [...] This man's head is gray; he has been all his life a waiter in London--and he {{can still see the}} cheerful side of things. What native strength of mind cast away on a vocation that is unworthy of it! ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Merrick sighed <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> {{his head}} again. Then he slowly rose.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Draconmeyer {{took off}} his gold-rimmed {{spectacles}} <b>and</b> <b>rubbed</b> them with his handkerchief.|$|R

6000|$|... "Another Christmas come, {{another year}} gone!" [...] murmured the Chemist, with a gloomy sigh. [...] "More {{figures in the}} {{lengthening}} sum of recollection that we work and work at to our torment, till Death idly jumbles all together, <b>and</b> <b>rubs</b> all out. So, Philip!" [...] breaking off, and raising his voice as he addressed the old man, standing apart, with his glistening burden in his arms, from which the quiet Mrs. William took small branches, which she noiselessly trimmed with her scissors, and decorated the room with, while her aged father-in-law looked on much interested in the ceremony.|$|E
60|$|She {{has her own}} {{method of}} {{cleaning}} them, too. She rubs off the mud, puts on the blacking, and polishes up all with the same brush. They take {{an enormous amount of}} polishing. She seems to do nothing else all day long but walk about shining one boot, and she breathes on it <b>and</b> <b>rubs</b> it till you wonder there is any leather left, yet it never seems to get any brighter, nor, indeed, can you expect it to, for when you look close you see it is a patent-leather boot that she has been throwing herself away upon all this time.|$|E
6000|$|... "You must {{remember}} {{that she is a}} mixture, Mary; she is like a panther, as graceful, and as supple; a charming beast when it purrs <b>and</b> <b>rubs</b> itself against the legs of its keeper, terrible when, in passion, it hurls itself upon him. In the early days the students were, to a man, fascinated with her. I stood quite alone in my disapproval. Seeing her as I saw her to-day, I admit that she is charming, but I cannot forget her fury as she bounded, knife in hand, upon the man I had knocked down. Listen! do your hear that rattle of musketry down by Pont du Jour? The troops must be working their way up towards the gate. Possibly, it {{is the beginning of the}} end." ...|$|E
60|$|By dint of chafing <b>and</b> <b>rubbing</b> <b>and</b> leaping and stamping, {{the whole}} party were soon {{restored}} to a serviceable condition, {{after which they}} set about active preparations for departure.|$|R
