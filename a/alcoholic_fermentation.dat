40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{study is}} focused on the {{evaluation}} of the impact of Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolism in the profile of compounds with antioxidant capacity in a synthetic wine during fermentation. A bioanalytical pipeline, which allows for biological systems fingerprinting and sample classification by combining electrochemical features with biochemical background, is proposed. To achieve this objective, <b>alcoholic</b> <b>fermentations</b> of a minimal medium supplemented with phenolic acids were evaluated daily during 11 days, for electrochemical profile, phenolic acids, and the volatile fermentation fraction, using cyclic voltametry, high-performance liquid chromatography−diode array detection, and headspace/solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography−mass spectrometry (target and nontarget approaches), respectively. It was found that acetic acid, 2 -phenylethanol, and isoamyl acetate are compounds with a significative contribution for samples metabolic variability, and the electrochemical features demonstrated redox-potential changes throughout the <b>alcoholic</b> <b>fermentations,</b> showing at the end a similar pattern to normal wines.

40|$|Abstract This study {{investigates the}} {{application}} of NIR spectroscopy for real-time monitoring of process parameters in <b>alcoholic</b> <b>fermentations.</b> For this purpose, fermentation batches using Saccharomyces cerevisiae were carried out and monitored in situ by an immersed NIRS probe. Samples were collected throughout the fermentations, and concentrations of biomass, glucose, ethanol and glycerin were analyzed by reference methods and multivariate data analyses such as PCA and PLSR. PCA was used to investigate data variability and to select samples for calibration and for external validation sets. A PLSR model for biomass yielded R 2 and RMSEP values of 0. 99 and 0. 276 g. L- 1, respectively. For glucose, the carbon source, the PLSR model yielded an R 2 of 0. 95 and an RMSEP of 7. 14 g. L- 1. The PLSR model for ethanol was characterized by an R 2 of 0. 95 and an RMSEP of 0. 06 g. L- 1. For glycerin, a highly accurate PLSR model with an R 2 of 0. 98 and an RMSEP of 0. 116 g.

In this work, we analysed 18 commercial Italian ciders by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and found traces of HEWL in 12 samples without label declaration. We used western blot and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to verify the immunological activity of HEWL, and to quantify its content in the ciders. Two out of 18 samples resulted positive both to Immunoblot and ELISA. Our results indicate the requirement of a more stringent control of the commercial ciders and the need of label declaration for ciders treated with such compounds...|$|R
50|$|The {{utilization}} of microbial-cultured starches {{to generate a}} fermentation {{has a long history}} in Asian countries, as seen by the large diversity of foods and beverages produced. Brewing alcoholic beverages from grains typically involves the use of sprouted cereal grains that supply natural enzymes to break down carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. The ensuing liquid obtained is fermented by microbes and turned into an alcoholic drink. As the grains used for traditional Asian <b>alcoholic</b> <b>fermentations</b> are raw and unsprouted (read unmalted), the enzymes responsible for the conversion of carbohydrates to fermentable sugars are absent and thus fermentation cannot proceed. Culturing microbes on cereal grains is a time-honoured tradition from Asia and the necessary way around this dilemma, as they exude the enzymes that allow liquefaction and saccharification to occur (up to fifty different enzymes have been isolated from Aspergillus oryzae starters). Their mutualistic symbiosis with fermentative yeast and bacteria initiates the complex saccharification-liquefaction-fermentation process to produce the sought after alcoholic liquid.|$|R

25|$|According to Canadian Food and Drug Regulations, wine in Canada is an {{alcoholic}} beverage that {{is produced by}} the complete or partial <b>alcoholic</b> <b>fermentation</b> of fresh grapes, grape must, products derived solely from fresh grapes, or any combination of them. There are many materials added {{during the course of}} the manufacture, such as yeast, concentrated grape juice, dextrose, fructose, glucose or glucose solids, invert sugar, sugar, or aqueous solutions. Calcium sulphate in such quantity that the content of soluble sulphates in the finished wine shall not exceed 0.2 per cent weight by volume calculated as potassium sulphate. Calcium carbonate in such quantity that the content of tartaric acid in the finished wine shall not be less than 0.15 per cent weight by volume.

25|$|Vitamin B1 or {{thiamine}} {{is present}} at a concentration between 0.2 and 0.5 milligrams per litre.

On the other hand, for a degraded harvest (by gray mold), the degradation of this vitamin leads the winemaker to add it to the must to ensure a trouble-free fermentation. In the case of a harvest with a very clear wort and low temperature the yeast works in a limited way and the addition of thiamine can help avoid a difficult end of fermentation. Legislation limits the amount added to 30 milligrams per hectolitre.|$|E
40|$|Industrial yeast {{performance}} is often compromised during <b>alcoholic</b> <b>fermentations</b> due to bi-product inhibition. Ethanol {{is arguably the}} product with {{the greatest impact on}} yeast performance, acting as a potent chemical stress on yeast cells. This stress eventually inhibits yeast growth and reduces ceil viability, therefore limiting alcohol concentrations in the final product and increasing fermentation turnover times. The reduced cell growth rate and viability, as well as an increased growth lag period, are characteristic signs of cell stress. This is often accompanied at a molecular level by the induction of stress response genes. While there have been several investigations into the effects of ethanol on yeast, few have focused on the underlying genetic mechanisms that enable yeast cells to tolerate and adapt to this stress. This thesis used differential display and gene array technologies to determine, at a molecular genetics level, how yeast cells adapt to sub-lethal concentrations of ethanol. Such information is of fundamental importance to the development of yeast strains and strategies for the improvement of yeast performance in fermentation...|$|R

25|$|The Oenococcus genus has {{one main}} member {{involved}} in winemaking, O. oeni, {{once known as}} Leuconostoc oeni. Despite having the name Oenococcus, under the microscope, the bacterium has a bacillus (shape) rod shape. The bacteria is a Gram-positive, facultative anaerobe that can utilize some oxygen for aerobic respiration but usually produces cellular energy through fermentation. O. oeni is a heterofermenter that create multiple end products {{from the use of}} glucose with D-lactic acid and carbon dioxide being produced in roughly equal amounts to either ethanol or acetate. In reductive conditions (such as near the end of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>fermentation),</b> the third end product is usually ethanol while in slightly oxidative (such as early in alcohol fermentation or in an untopped barrel), the bacteria are more likely to produce acetate.|$|E
25|$|Winemakers tend {{to prefer}} O. oeni for several reasons. First, {{the species is}} {{compatible}} with the main wine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, though in cases where both MLF and <b>alcoholic</b> <b>fermentation</b> are started together, the yeast most often outcompetes the bacterium for nutritional resources which may cause a delay in the onset of malolactic fermentation. Second, most strains of O. oeni are tolerant to the low pH levels of wine and can usually deal with the standard alcohol levels that most wines reach by the end of fermentation. Additionally, while sulfur dioxide levels above 0.8 molecular SO2 (pH dependent but roughly 35-50 ppm) will inhibit the bacteria, O. oeni is relatively resistant compared to other LAB. Finally, O. oeni tends to produce the least amount of biogenic amines (and most lactic acid) among the lactic acid bacteria encountered in winemaking.|$|E
25|$|Soon after inoculation, yeast {{begin to}} rapidly consume the {{available}} assimilable nitrogen {{with up to}} 46% of YAN being fully consumed by the onset of full fermentation. Because inorganic nitrogen, such as the ammonium salts in DAP, are toxic to yeast in high levels, it is never added during inoculation when the biomass of the newly re-hydrated yeast is low. Many winemakers split up the dosage of DAP with the first addition being made {{at the end of}} the lag phase when the yeast enter their period of exponential growth and <b>alcoholic</b> <b>fermentation</b> begins. In most must this is around 48 to 72 hours after inoculation. A second dosage is then often added around a third of the way through sugar fermentation and often before the sugar levels hit 12-10 Brix (6.5 to 5.5 Baumé, 48.3 to 40.0 Oechsle) because as the fermentation progresses yeast cells are no longer able to bring the nitrogen into the cell due to the increasing toxicity of ethanol surrounding the cells. This leaves the nitrogen unused and available for spoilage organisms that may come afterwards.|$|E

We made a kinetic study {{of the effects of}} 1 to 5 % (wt/vol) NaCl on the <b>alcoholic</b> <b>fermentations</b> of glucose by Saccharomyces cerevisiae in a growth medium containing 16 % gelatin. Our results showed that the effect of high salt content on semisolid culture is essentially the same as the effect on liquid culture; i. e., as the salt content increased, the following occurred: (i) the growth of yeasts decreased, (ii) the lag period of the yeast biomass curve lengthened, (iii) the sugar intake was lowered, (iv) the yield of ethanol was reduced, and (v) the production of glycerol was increased.
