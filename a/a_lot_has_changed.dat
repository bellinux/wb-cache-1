The {{events of the}} fifth season begin {{one year after the}} season 4 finale. Rebecca {{divorced}} Justin and was written out of the show early in the fifth season. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> for both the characters, and the show's viewers in the final season. The show lost two cast members: Rebecca Harper (Emily VanCamp) and Robert McCallister (Rob Lowe). These two losses were not the only major changes that occurred in season five. The Ojai Foods building, the Walker's family business, is not seen in the final season and many locations are different than in the last season. Kitty no longer lives at the ranch in Santa Barbara, but has moved into a smaller house with her son, Evan, after a short stay at a cottage in Ojai. Kevin and Scotty moved out of their apartment and into a different one which is located above Cafe 429 (the restaurant that Scotty and Saul opened). Cafe 429, and Nora's new workplace – the radio station, are two primary locations where many scenes take place in season five. One location that the audience does not see as much is Nora's house. For four seasons, the family home has been the location where most scenes were shot. That said, all of these changes have been made to fit in with the characters' new lives and chapters.|$|E

50|$|For {{the first}} time in four years, the Giants had reached the Japan Series. They had not won the series since 1994, when they faced the Seibu Lions. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> in the six years since they had won, but the plethora of stars that they had been {{building}} since the mid-1990s was finally enough {{to get back to the}} Japan Series. Yomiuri had a powerful middle of the order between aging slugger Kazuhiro Kiyohara and Hideki Matsui. The pitching staff featured established stars such as Kudoh and Hiromi Makihara.|$|R

Botany Bay 2010 is a follow up to the 1980 series, but using colour photography with some minimal colour painting. In 2010, Hazelhurst Regional Gallery and Arts Centre held the first exhibition of the series Botany Bay 2010, since which the series has been displayed at national galleries across Australia, alongside Allan's more recent work.|$|R

While Brokaw did not ask the initial questions, he did ask {{follow-up}} ones. When the candidates were asked who they would consider as the next Secretary of the Treasury, John McCain said that he might concur with Obama's suggestion of Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett and then went on also to suggest former eBay president Meg Whitman. Barack Obama reiterated the mention of Buffett and said there are also many other qualified Americans. Both candidates said {{that it is important to}} choose as Treasury Secretary someone who earns the trust of the American people. The first 5 questions all were related to the economy.|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> at Wimbledon Football Club since Barton {{had last}} played for them nine years earlier. They had survived in the Premier League for five seasons after his departure, finally {{going down in}} 1999-2000. The {{decision}} to relocate the club to Milton Keynes was approved in May 2002, after the Dons narrowly missed out on the Division One playoffs for the second season running. In spite {{of some of the}} lowest attendances in the league after the majority of the club's fans defected to newly formed AFC Wimbledon (at non-League level), the Dons had managed a respectable 10th-place finish in 2002-03, but then they went into administration and were forced to sell most of their key players. As a result, their fortunes on the pitch suffered and the move to Milton Keynes in September 2003 (initially in the National Hockey Stadium until a new permanent stadium was built) did little to solve matters. By the time Barton arrived at the end of February, the club was still in administration and relegation (if not complete closure) was almost certain. Barton appeared in just five games for the Dons as they went down in bottom place with a massive 33 defeats (one of the worst Football League records ever) and on 17 September 2004 he finally departed from the club, who for the 2004-05 had been re-formed as Milton Keynes Dons to reflect their new location. At the age of 35, Barton's senior career was over.|$|R

He replied, Look, I can understand why the tent embassy was established all those years ago. I think <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> for the better since then.
