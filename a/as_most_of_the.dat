5|$|A {{little before}} 16:00, Ney noted an {{apparent}} exodus from Wellington's centre. He mistook {{the movement of}} casualties to the rear for {{the beginnings of a}} retreat, and sought to exploit it. Following the defeat of d'Erlon's Corps, Ney had few infantry reserves left, <b>as</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infantry had been committed either to the futile Hougoumont attack or to the defence of the French right. Ney therefore tried to break Wellington's centre with cavalry alone.|$|E
5|$|After {{their initial}} advances, the 342nd Infantry Division {{spent the next}} few days mopping up the areas they had entered. The 697th Regiment {{advanced}} south from Vlasenica through the Javor Mountains, meeting little resistance and capturing Han Pijesak on 22 January. Elements of the 697th Regiment pushed west towards Olovo the same day. The 698th Regiment cleared the area around Rogatica, killing 50 and capturing 200 insurgents, and liberating 63 captured Croatian Home Guard soldiers. The 699th Regiment patrolled the area as far as Vlasenica and Srebrenica. These mopping up operations achieved little, <b>as</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> insurgents had escaped the encirclement before it was completed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} is that megalodon bore a similarity to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) or the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus). The tail fin {{would have been}} crescent-shaped, the anal fin and second dorsal fin would have been small, and {{there would have been}} a caudal keel present on either side of the tail fin (on the caudal peduncle). This build is common in other large aquatic animals, such as whales, tuna, and other sharks, in order to reduce drag while swimming. The head shape, however, can vary between species <b>as</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drag-reducing adaptations are toward the tail-end of the animal.|$|E

5|$|As Gingrich {{primed for}} another {{run in the}} 1978 elections, Flynt decided to retire. Gingrich {{defeated}} Democratic State Senator Virginia Shapard by 7,500 votes. Gingrich was re-elected six times from this district. He faced a close general election race once—in the House elections of 1990—when he won by 978 votes in a race against Democrat David Worley. Although the district was trending Republican at the national level, conservative Democrats continued to hold most local offices, as well <b>as</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area's seats in the General Assembly, well into the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{songs are}} {{in the form of}} Ovee, Ranade decided to use the {{traditional}} musical format. He took help of Sarojini Babar, a Marathi writer-politician who had studied the songs of the period depicted in the film. Babar introduced Ranade to her sister, Kumud Pawar, who have made a collection of various traditional Ovee. For two situation songs, Ranade requested Kishor Kadam to write the lyrics.|$|E
5|$|Atala-Dunlop's Luigi Ganna {{abandoned}} the race during the fifth stage due to injuries {{suffered from a}} crash during the fourth stage before it was cancelled. Galetti won the fifth leg, but with the placings on the stage, Peugeot took the race lead from Atala-Dunlop. Rain marred {{the start of the}} sixth stage at 6:40 local time, as well <b>as</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage itself. A group of sixteen riders formed {{at the front of the}} race and was later reduced to ten before passing through Lucca. Lauro Bordin of the Gerbi team attacked and went on to ride solo, reaching the checkpoint in Spezia fifteen minutes quicker than Azzini, Cocchi, and Agostoni. Bordin reached the finish first, eighteen minutes ahead of the second-place finisher.|$|E

5|$|Disney {{initially}} envisioned Toy Story 2 as a direct-to-video sequel. The film began {{production in}} a building separated from Pixar, on a small scale, <b>as</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main Pixar staff were busy working on A Bug's Life (1998). When story reels proved promising, Disney upgraded the film to theatrical release, but Pixar was unhappy with the film's quality. Lasseter and the story team redeveloped the entire plot in one weekend. Although most Pixar features take years to develop, the established release date could not be moved and the production schedule for Toy Story 2 was compressed into nine months.|$|E

5|$|Ecliptic {{coordinates}} are {{convenient for}} specifying positions of Solar System objects, <b>as</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planets' orbits have small inclinations to the ecliptic, and therefore always appear relatively {{close to it}} on the sky.

5|$|In a statement, an EMI {{spokesperson}} {{maintained that}} the label {{had been forced to}} take procedural, legal steps in order to protect their investment and rights during contract renegotiations initiated by the band and management. However, Thirty Seconds to Mars also expressed dissatisfaction with the then-recent Terra Firma takeover of EMI, <b>as</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> employees the band had worked with were fired {{as a result of a}} major restructuring under TF chairman Guy Hands. The band were among several of the label's artists, unhappy with the transition, who quickly tried to terminate their contracts; the list also included The Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney. Former EMI executives gave interviews describing how the sale resulted in massive upheaval and staff cuts.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Ngô family {{claimed that}} the army had carried out the raids, {{something}} their U.S. allies initially believed. However, this was later debunked, and the incident prompted the United States to turn against the regime and begin exploring alternative leadership options, eventually leading to Diệm's overthrow in a coup. In South Vietnam itself, the raids stoked widespread anger. Several high-ranking public servants resigned, and university {{and high school students}} boycotted classes and staged riotous demonstrations, resulting in further mass incarcerations. <b>As</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students were from middle-class public service and military families, the arrests caused further upset among the Ngô family's power base.|$|E

25|$|The British first {{appointed}} a superintendent over the Belize area in 1786. Before then the British government had not recognized the settlement as a colony {{for fear of}} provoking a Spanish attack. The delay in government oversight allowed the settlers to establish their own laws and forms of government.

5|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are relatively inefficient at converting on-board fuel energy to propulsion <b>as</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> energy is wasted as heat, {{and the rest}} while the engine is idling. Electric motors, on the other hand, are more efficient at converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. Electric drive vehicles do not consume energy while at rest or coasting, and modern plug-in cars can capture and reuse {{as much as one}} fifth of the energy normally lost during braking through regenerative braking. Typically, conventional gasoline engines effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and diesel engines can reach on-board efficiencies of 20%, while electric drive vehicles typically have on-board efficiencies of around 80%.|$|E
5|$|Most {{galaxies in}} the Universe are gravitationally bound {{to a number of}} other galaxies. These form a fractal-like {{hierarchical}} distribution of clustered structures, with the smallest such associations being termed groups. A group of galaxies is {{the most common type of}} galactic cluster, and these formations contain a majority of the galaxies (as well <b>as</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> baryonic mass) in the Universe. To remain gravitationally bound to such a group, each member galaxy must have a sufficiently low velocity to prevent it from escaping (see Virial theorem). If there is insufficient kinetic energy, however, the group may evolve into a smaller number of galaxies through mergers.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the storm}} {{resulted}} in 173confirmed fatalities. Officials in West Bengal accused the meteorological offices of issuing warnings too late, <b>as</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fishermen {{were already in}} deep sea areas. Immediately following the storm, the Indian Red Cross Society and the Participating National Societies began to assess the situation and plan.
