40|$|A cross {{sectional}} study {{based on all}} (1260) general practices in the West Midlands was conducted in late 1984 and early 1985. Responses to a postal questionnaire were received from 762 (60. 5 %) practices, and of these, 387 (50. 8 %) stated that they had an age-sex register; 104 (13. 6 %) practices replied that they had definite plans to establish an <b>age-sex</b> <b>register</b> within six months, and {{a random sample of}} these was later telephoned to see if the plans had come to fruition. A random telephone sample was also made from the 498 (39. 5 %) non-responders. It was concluded that the current prevalence of age-sex registers in the West Midlands is 52 % (+/- 5 % for 95 % confidence) of all practices. A register has now been established of 422 practices (35. 5 % of the total number in the West Midlands) that have an <b>age-sex</b> <b>register.</b> This is being used as a database for other research. The most common reason stated for not having an <b>age-sex</b> <b>register</b> was that it would be too time consuming.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a point prevalent evaluation of the comparative reliability and validity of <b>age-sex</b> <b>registers,</b> practice medical records and family practitioner committee (FPC) registers from five teaching practices. They all exhibited similar levels of acceptable accuracy for patient names, sex and age, but the distribution of wrong addresses varied greatly: practice medical records 3 · 9 per cent, <b>age-sex</b> <b>registers</b> 8 · 2 per cent and FPC registers 17 · 1 per cent. The presence of a patient entry in all three registers was associated {{with a high degree of}} probability (95 · 3 per cent) that this individual would be a bona fide practice patient. The register population inflation rates were FPC records 5 · 5 per cent, practice records 9 · 8 per cent and <b>age-sex</b> <b>registers</b> 10 · 6 per cent, but there were large variations between individual practices. A statistically significant contribution to inflation rates came from the age groups 0 to 1 and 21 to 40 (p< 0 · 0005). The register population deflation rates were minimal. The significance of these findings is discussed and the need for practices to determine the accuracy of their individual <b>age-sex</b> <b>registers</b> is stressed. A convenient and economic method for so doing is suggested. We also suggest ways of making it easier to construct and use <b>age-sex</b> <b>registers,</b> since they can be a most versatile and useful aid to research in general practice...|$|R

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using an <b>age-sex</b> <b>register</b> {{as a basis}} for a cervical cancer screening programme was investigated in a London practice serving both inner city and suburban populations. Only about 25 % of 810 women aged 35 - 59 years who had not recently been screened responded to an invitation to attend a practice well woman clinic for a cervical smear. Nearly 30 % of the invitations were returned `not known at this address' and there was no reply from the remaining 45 %. A high proportion of incorrect addresses considerably reduces the effectiveness of a cancer screening programme based on an <b>age-sex</b> <b>register</b> covering an area with a mobile population and also makes it difficult to follow up women with abnormal smears adequately. Opportunistic screening remains essential and every effort should be made to encourage women to be responsible for their own cancer screening programmes...|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} whether a cervical screening call system based in general practice in a deprived inner city area would increase the numbers of women who came forward for cervical smears the response to letters of invitation for screening was monitored for one year in one general practice in the Paddington and North Kensington district of London. Women aged 20 - 64 were identified from the computerised <b>age-sex</b> <b>register.</b> Only 16 % of these women had had a smear test. A total of 750 call letters was sent out. Initially the response was poor (57 women; 22 %), and 85 (32 %) letters were returned marked "address unknown.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} occupational social class and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence, {{and the extent to}} which classical and lifestyle risk factors explain such relationships, and if any differences persist after 65 years of age. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective population study of 22, 478 men and women aged 39 - 79 years living in the general community in Norfolk, United Kingdom, recruited using general practice <b>age-sex</b> <b>registers</b> in 1993 - 1997 and followed up for total mortality to 2006.

Background: Musculoskeletal pain is reported more commonly by South Asians in the UK than by white Europeans. This may result from a variety of factors, including cultural differences and thus we investigated the extent to which differences in the prevalence of pain within the South Asian population could be explained by differences in acculturation (the extent to which immigrants take on the culture of their host population). Methods: 933 Europeans and 1914 South Asian (1165 Indian, 401 Pakistani and 348 Bangladeshi) subjects were recruited from the <b>age-sex</b> <b>registers</b> of 13 general practices in areas with high densities of South Asian populations (Bolton, Oldham, Ashton-under-Lyne and Birmingham).

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{compare the}} {{prevalence}} of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Black-Caribbeans and Whites {{living in the same}} urban area. METHODS [...] Cases of inflammatory joint disease were ascertained initially from a postal screening survey of 1851 Black and 1829 age and sex-matched non-Blacks identified from general practice <b>age-sex</b> <b>registers</b> of seven general practices in the Moss Side and Hulme districts of Manchester. The ethnicity of respondents was confirmed using data from a postal screening questionnaire. Those reporting joint swelling or a history of arthritis were reviewed by a rheumatologist at surgeries held in each practice. The clinical records of the questionnaire non-responders and questionnaire-positive non-attenders at surgery were reviewed. RESULTS [...] In an adjusted denominator population of 1046 Black-Caribbeans and 997 Whites, the cumulative prevalence of RA was 2. 9 / 1000 in Black-Caribbeans and 8 / 1000 in Whites, representing a prevalence in Black-Caribbeans of 0. 36 times that found in Whites (95 % confidence interval 0. 1 - 1. 3).

The findings are consistent with published studies showing a low RA prevalence in rural African Black populations...|$|R
40|$|Background: Exposure to hand-transmitted {{vibration}} (HTV) {{can cause}} sensorineural symptoms {{in the upper}} limb, but its impact has not previously been assessed in the general population. Methods: To investigate, we mailed a questionnaire about exposures to HTV, finger blanching and sensory symptoms (numbness or tingling) in the upper limbs to a population sample comprising 21, 201 working-aged men and women selected at random from the <b>age-sex</b> <b>registers</b> of 34 British general practices, and a further 993 randomly selected from the pay records of the armed services. Associations were explored using multiple logistic regression models to adjust for confounding, with the resultant odds ratios converted into prevalence rate ratios (PRs). Results: Of 12, 907 respondents, 2, 607 (20. 2 %) reported sensory symptoms in the upper limb during the past week. Sensory symptoms were more prevalent in those with blanching, and were commonly associated with exposure to HTV, especially in men. In comparison with men {{who had never been}} exposed to HTV, the PR in men exposed both at work and in leisure was 2. 2 (95 % CI 1. 9 - 2. 4). Associations were found even in those who had never blanched. Conclusions: Sensorineural symptoms in the upper limbs are common. HTV is an important risk factor for such complaints in the general population...|$|R

40|$|Background: An {{association}} {{has previously been}} reported between finger blanching and hearing dif-ficulties, but only in workers with exposure to noise and hand transmitted vibration (HTV). Aims: To explore the association in a community sample, including cases who lacked occupational exposure to noise or HTV. Method: A questionnaire was mailed to 12 606 subjects aged 35 – 64 years, chosen at random from the <b>age–sex</b> <b>registers</b> of 34 British general practices. Inquiry was made about years of employment in noisy jobs, lifetime exposure to HTV, hearing difficulties and tinnitus, and lifetime history of cold induced finger blanching. Subjects were classed as having severe hearing difficulty if they used a hear-ing aid or found it difficult or impossible to hear conversation in a quiet room. Associations of finger blanching with hearing difficulties and tinnitus were analysed by logistic regression. Results: Among 8193 respondents were 185 who reported severe hearing difficulty and 1151 who reported finger blanching. After adjustment for age and years of work in noisy jobs, hearing difficulty was about twice as common in {{men and women who}} reported finger blanching, including those who had never been importantly exposed to noise and in those never exposed to HTV.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Self-rated health (SRH), a {{subjective}} measure of health, is strongly predictive of mortality, independently of objective measures of health status and existing known disease. There {{is a strong}} social gradient in SRH. An investigation was carried to determine whether SRH can explain the well-known socioeconomic gradient in mortality. METHODS: The effect of adjusting for SRH on the socioeconomic differential in mortality was examined in a prospective study of 20 754 men and women aged 39 - 79 years, without prevalent disease, living in the general community in Norfolk, UK, recruited using general practice <b>age-sex</b> <b>registers</b> for 1993 - 1997 and followed up {{for an average of}} 10 years. RESULTS: Mortality risk increased with decreasing social class in men and women. There was some attenuation after adjustment for covariates age, body mass index, smoking, history of diabetes, systolic blood pressure, cholesterol level, alcohol consumption, physical activity and educational level, but a gradient remained. Further adjustment for SRH attenuated the association slightly more, but there was still some evidence of a socioeconomic differential in mortality, particularly in class V compared with class I (age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio 1. 57; 95 % CI 1. 19 to 2. 06). CONCLUSIONS: SRH does not substantially explain the socioeconomic differential in mortality beyond that explained by health-related covariates...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{establish}} whether ABO {{blood group}} {{is related to}} ischaemic heart disease on an individual and geographic basis in Britain. DESIGN [...] Prospective study of 7662 men with known ABO blood group selected from <b>age-sex</b> <b>registers</b> in general practices in 24 British towns. MEASUREMENTS [...] ABO blood group, standard cardiovascular risk factors, social class, and {{presence or absence of}} ischaemic heart disease determined at entry to study. END POINTS [...] Eight year follow up of fatal and nonfatal ischaemic heart disease events achieved for 99 % of study population. RESULTS [...] Towns with a higher prevalence of blood group O had higher incidences of ischaemic heart disease. In individual subjects, however, the incidence of ischaemic heart disease was higher in those with group A than in those with other blood groups (relative risk 1. 21, 95 % confidence limits 1. 01 to 1. 46). Total serum cholesterol concentration was slightly higher in subjects of blood group A. No other cardiovascular risk factor (including social class) was related to blood group. CONCLUSIONS [...] Blood group A is related to the incidence of ischaemic heart disease in individual subjects. Geographic differences in the distribution of ABO blood groups do not explain geographic variation in rates of ischaemic heart disease in Britain. The findings do not support the view that ABO blood group and social class are related...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{estimate}} the prevalence of respiratory symptoms among people aged 65 years and older and assess {{the value of a}} postal survey in obtaining this information. A questionnaire was sent to 2011 subjects (957 men) drawn by age-stratified random sampling from the <b>age-sex</b> <b>registers</b> of four New Forest group practices (1 : 3. 3 sample). A total of 1803 replied, a 96. 2 % response after excluding 136 who had died or moved from the area. The accuracy of replies was verified for 355 (20 °o) randomly selected subjects. Forty per cent had no respiratory symptoms. Exertional breathlessness was common (38 °O), increasing in prevalence with age but not with smoking history, and was the only symptom reported by 10 % of subjects. Only 14. 2 % were current smokers; more of the subjects aged 85 years and over were lifelong non-smokers.

Consequently, a qualitative study of the willingness {{of women who are}} postmenopausal to participate in a long-term randomized control trial of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) designed to investigate the prevention of degenerative diseases was conducted. Focus group methodology was employed to explore the personal and social aspects of decision making about trial participation. Participants were randomly selected from the patient <b>age-sex</b> <b>registers</b> of four University of Adelaide general practices. Twenty-one women participated in four focus groups. The reasons for and against trial participation were examined using qualitative content analysis; (n = 18) women were unwilling to participate in the trial. The lack of perceived individual benefit, minimal altruism, {{the risk of breast cancer}} and side effects, not wanting to take unnecessary medication, a ten-year commitment, and negative experiences of HRT use, were the main reasons given for not entering the trial. Of the few women (n = 3) who clearly would enter the trial, free prescriptions and a positive history of using HRT were the main reasons for participation. The perceived disadvantages of clinical trials of HRT deter women from participating in a long-term clinical trial of HRT.

40|$|The {{association}} between respiratory function and bone mineral density (BMD) among {{women living in}} the community has been reported previously. We examined the {{association between}} forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) and BMD measured at hip using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry {{in a group of}} 947 men (aged 65 to 76 years) recruited from general practice <b>age-sex</b> <b>registers</b> in Cambridge between 1991 and 1995. A positive and significant correlation was seen between FEV(1) and BMD measured at total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter. A unit change (1 l) in FEV(1) was associated with a change of BMD by 0. 019, 0. 017, and 0. 026 g/cm(2) in the total hip, femoral neck, and tochanteric region, respectively. These associations were independent of possible confounding factors such as age, height, weight, smoking habit, major disease prevalence, and medications, which might affect bone metabolism. In categorical analyses, the highest BMD was seen in the highest FEV(1) quartile, while the lowest BMD was seen in the lowest FEV(1) quartile. This pattern was seen in all three skeletal sites and was independent of covariates listed above. Compared with the bottom FEV(1) quartile, mean hip BMDs in the top quartile were 2 - 3. 5 % higher. The exact mechanism of this association is not clear to us. One plausible explanation is that respiratory function and bone health both reflect common but as yet unknown determinants...|$|R
