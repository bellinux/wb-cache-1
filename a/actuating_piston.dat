The right front and left rear {{are served by}} one <b>actuating</b> <b>piston</b> while the left front and the right rear are served, exclusively, by a second <b>actuating</b> <b>piston</b> (both pistons pressurize their respective coupled lines from a single foot pedal). If either circuit fails, the other, {{with at least one}} front wheel braking (the front brakes provide most of the braking force, due to weight transfer), remains intact to stop the mechanically damaged vehicle.

40|$|The {{operation}} of the thermo-mechanical unit of a cryogenic cooler may originate a resonant excitation of the spacecraft frame, optical bench or components of the optical train. This may result in degraded functionality of the inherently vibration sensitive space-borne infrared imager directly associated with the cooler or neighboring instrumentation typically requiring a quiet micro-g environment. The best practice for controlling cooler induced vibration relies {{on the principle of}} active momentum cancellation. In particular, the pressure wave generator typically contains two oppositely <b>actuated</b> <b>piston</b> compressors, while the single piston expander is counterbalanced by an auxiliary active counter-balancer. Active vibration cancellation is supervised by a dedicated DSP feed-forward controller, where the error signals are delivered by the vibration sensors (accelerometers or load cells). This can result in oversized, overweight and overpriced cryogenic coolers with degraded electromechanical performance and impaired reliability. The authors are advocating a reliable, compact, cost and power saving approach capitalizing on the combined application of a passive tuned dynamic absorber and a low frequency vibration isolator. This concept appears to be especially suitable for low budget missions involving mini and micro satellites, where price, size, weight and power consumption are of concern...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{management}} issues necessitate {{the use of}} fuel as a {{heat sink}} for gas turbine and liquid rocket engines. There are certain benefits to using heated fuels, namely, increased sensible enthalpy, increased combustion efficiency, a decrease in certain emissions, and enhanced vaporization characteristics. However, the thermal and pressure enviornment inside an injector can result in the fuel flashing to vapor. Depending on the injector design, this can have deleterious effects on engine performance. As interest in heated fuels inreases, {{it is important to}} understand what occurs in the flow path of an injector under flashing conditions. ^ At the High Pressure Laboratory at Purdue University 2 Ì† 7 s Maurice J. Zucrow Laboritories, a test rig was designed and built to give visual access into the flow path of a 2 -D slot injector. The rig is capable of pressurizing and heating a liquid to superheated conditions and utilizes a pneumatically <b>actuated</b> <b>piston</b> to pusth the liquid through the slot injector. Methanol was chosen as a surrogate fuel to allow for high levels of superheat at relatively low temperatures. Testing was completed with acrylic and quartz injectors of varying L/DH. ^ Flashing conditions inside the injector flow path were induced via a combination of heating and back pressure adjustments. Volume flow rate, pressure measurements, and temperature measurements were made which allowed the discharge characteristics, the level of superheat, and other parameters to be calculated and compared. To give a basis for comparison the flashing results are compared to the flow through the injector under cavitating conditions. Cavitation and flashing appear to be related phenomena and this relationship is shown. Bubble formation under cavitating or flashing conditions is observed to attenuate the injector 2 Ì† 7 s discharge characteristics. ^ High speed videos of the flow field were also collected. Several flow regimes and flow structures, unique to these regimes, were observed. A frequency analysis was also performed on the video files. Bubble formation in the flow field dominates the frequency spectrum, which is confined below 1 kHz. ^ The test campaign was successful. The result is a possible way to predict an injector 2 Ì† 7 s performance under flashing conditions without running heated fuel through the injector. These results may be applicable to real world injector design and testing. ...|$|R

40|$|Metal powder {{propulsion}} systems employ metal powder, {{rather than a}} fluid, as a fuel which is transported and injected into a combustion chamber where it mixes with an oxidiser, ignites and combusts to provide high thrust. This concept has been addressed intermittently since the Second World War, initially {{in the field of}} underwater propulsion where research in the application of propelling torpedoes continues until this day. During the post war era, researchers attempted to apply metal powder as a fuel for ram jet applications in missiles. The 1960 's and 1970 's saw additional interest in the use of 'pure powder' propellants, i. e. fluidised metal fuel and fluidised oxidiser, both in solid particulate form. Again the application was for employment in space-constrained missiles where the idea was to maximise the performance of high energy density powder propellant in order to enhance the missile flight duration by omitting the use of binders, curing agents and high energy plasticisers. Volumetric propellant density for both underwater and ramjet propulsion would decrease since the oxidiser component, sea water and ram-air, respectively, would not have to be stored within the system. These ordnance delivery systems did not however {{see the light of day}} and attention thereafter, i. e. 1980 's onwards, expanded to include the use of metal powder as a possible in-situ resource utilisation (ISRU) fuel for space propusion systems where the focus was on the use of gaseous oxygen (GOX) or liquid oxygen (LOX) combined with aluminium metal powder as a "lunar soil propellant" or carbon dioxide (CO[sub] 2) and magnesium powder as a "Martian soil propellant". The emphasis of this study is the use of oxygen (O[sub] 2) /aluminium metal powder propellant for space propulsion rather than for terrestrial (military) applications. There are two principal objectives of this MSc by Research. Prior to this study, a literature review of metal powder {{propulsion systems}} has never been addressed; this being the first objective. The second objective was to employ the knowledge acquired from the literature review and examine all alternative subsystems via a series of detailed weighted decision matrices (WDMs) in order to determine which components would be the most appropriate to utilise in a technology demonstrator. These two tasks are seen as prerequisites to the continuation of researhc and dvelopment of metal powder propulsion systems. The literature review and WDMs comprise tow out of three main sections of the dissertation. The WDMs determined that the bimodal 3 / 21 [mu]m mix with a 30 / 70 weight distribution, respectively, was the best option for maximising packing density as well as for powder feed, powder injection and powder combustion. The cylinder connected to a hopper was the most appropriate configuration for powder storage and the mechanically <b>actuated</b> <b>piston</b> and mechanically <b>actuated</b> auger provided the best performance for pwder feed. The dust dispersion system met favourably with all the criteria for powder injection and the pyrotechnic squib supplied the required energy to ignite the O[sub] 2 /aluminium metal powder propellant. Combustion efficiency is improved by operating the engine initially in fuel-rich mode in a (pre-) combustor and then lean mode in a main combustor. The thrid section presents an ideal schematic for a technology demonstrator based on the aforementioned findings and a final section concludes with recommendations for future work...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} nastic materials applied to twisting a rigid beam. Nastic materials contain small, simple machines in a compliant matrix. Here a generic beam must twist by ? 4 degrees; the ? 4 degrees twist is an optimum value {{to change the}} angle of attack on a helicopter?s rotor blade. Small piston actuators distributed through the beam?s outer core provide the internal work needed. By <b>actuating</b> the <b>piston</b> elements in their axial direction, which is transverse to the beam?s central axis, the beam twists as desired. This study?s objective is to gain insight into the geometry, the material property combinations, and the boundary conditions that produce nastic materials and structures that twist. An important performance metric is the work density, which {{is the product of}} blocked stress and free strain. Blocked stress is the maximum actuation stress in a single stroke that produces maximum work output and free strain is the maximum actuation strain that produces the maximum work output. Optimum work density was found for the piston actuators. As it is difficult to model distributed piston actuators across the beam?s outer core, piston actuator?s effective properties are calculated using finite element models and homogenized in the beam?s outer core. As the goal is to twist a beam, an important parameter in comparing the active beam to a passive beam is torsional stiffness. Torsional stiffness is torque per unit deflection. The active beam?s torsional stiffness is 13. 705 MN-m/rad without twist in the initial state, which is 3. 5 times stiffer than the passive beam, and 13. 341 MN-m/rad at the twisted state, which shows that the beam loses 2. 6 % of its stiffness during twist. The passive beam?s density is 1000. 01 kg/m 3 and the active beam?s density is 1399. 42 kg/m 3, which shows that active structures have a weight penalty that must be less than achieving the motion by traditional systems...|$|R

Desirable features of a groundwater desalination system include a high recovery ratio, operation from a sustainable energy source such as solar, and high water output per unit of energy and land. Here we propose a new system that uses a solar-Rankine cycle to drive reverse osmosis (RO).

50|$|Where a {{reciprocating}} action is produced, such {{as for a}} rock drill, the valve may be actuated either by inertia of the frame or by {{the movement of the}} working piston. As the piston hammers back and forth, it impacts a small tappet, which in turn moves the air valve and so reverses the flow of air to the piston. One form of this, the arc tappet valve, was an important feature of the Ingersoll rock drill, the first successful compressed air rock drill for use in mining and tunneling. This used a valve that rotated in a slight arc, rather than sliding. The valve was double-acting, controlling the air supply for both the power and the return stroke. The innovation that made this valve so reliable, thus successful, was a separate tappet that was <b>actuated</b> by the <b>piston</b> in passing at the middle of the stroke, rather than being hammered by a jarring direct impact of the piston. The mid-stroke actuation also opened the valve passageways earlier, before top dead centre, allowing in air that provided a cushioning effect. This further improved the action of the drill, giving a powerful stroke on the working piston and drill rod, but with less damaging hammering to the frame of the drill.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{purpose of}} this work was to design a system for {{measuring}} the velocity of a powder actuated fastener or drivepin during penetration. This system would provide a tool for further investigation into drivepin penetration characteristics. The main characteristic of interest is the instantaneous acceleration from which the forces on the drivepin can be determined. This acceleration was determined by designing a transducer whose output is drivepin position versus time and calculating the instantaneous velocity and acceleration, graphically and numerically, from these data. A powder actuated drivepin is a special nail-like pin which is driven into hard materials {{by the force of}} a charge of gunpowder. The powder actuated tool is similar to a pistol except the projectile is the drivepin and the charge is in a separate brass jacket. The penetration velocity previously referred to is the velocity spectrum during the total time the drivepin is in motion. Some of the transducers that were considered are listed with comments which affected their evaluation. Among these transducers, the linear resistance potentiometer was selected for this measuring system. It has the following characteristics: a. Simplicity b. High frequency response c. Good linearity d. Marginal mechanical strength e. Low, but sufficient output With this potentiometric transducer, an oscilloscope and camera were added to provide a time base and a permanent record. The test results or data are recorded as photographs of the oscilloscope trace. Various techniques for differentiating these data are discussed. These techniques include graphical, approximating polynomials by the method of finite differences, and best fitting curve by the method of least squares. Additional mathematical presentations are included to show the measuring system's linearity and frequency response and the equations of motion of the powder <b>actuated</b> tool and <b>piston.</b> The final configuration of the measuring system is a battery energized slide wire mounted inside a barrel and a collector mounted opposite the slide wire. The head of the drivepin contacts the slide wire during penetration and transfers this voltage to the collector. The collector voltage is fed into an oscilloscope for display as a function of time. The external trigger signal for starting the display is obtained from the first motion of drivepin as it passes through a metal foil {{on the surface of the}} material to be penetrated. This potentiometric measuring system was found to be adequate for the purpose intended. However, some mechanical modifications are recommended...|$|R
