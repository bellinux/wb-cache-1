5|$|After several {{rounds of}} {{negotiations}} mediated by Deng and Singapore's prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, FUNCINPEC, KPNLF, and the Khmer Rouge agreed {{to form the}} Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK) in June 1982. The CGDK was headed by Sihanouk, and functioned as a government-in-exile. The UN defeated a resolution to expel Democratic Kampuchea and <b>admit</b> <b>the</b> PRK, effectively confirming Sihanouk as Cambodia's internationally recognized head of state.|$|E
5|$|Concordant rites exist {{with the}} blessing and often the active support of regular masonic lodges. There are several {{concordant}} bodies in the United States which <b>admit</b> <b>the</b> wives and female relatives of Freemasons. The Dutch Order of Weavers admits only the wives, while in the American orders {{the men and women}} share in the ritual. Like the lodges of adoption, they have their own ceremonies, which means that some grand lodges view them as irregular.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not clear}} whether the members of the Ministerium {{intended}} for this to be a permanent break, or a temporary protest. Regardless, it became permanent when the officials at the next Gathering of the General Synod refused to <b>admit</b> <b>the</b> delegates from the Ministerium. Thus, the Ministerium found themselves on their own.|$|E
5|$|Messiaen's {{music has}} been {{described}} as outside the western musical tradition, although growing out of that tradition and being influenced by it. Much of his output denies the western conventions of forward motion, development and diatonic harmonic resolution. This is partly due to the symmetries of his technique—for instance the modes of limited transposition do not <b>admit</b> <b>the</b> conventional cadences found in western classical music.|$|E

Upon terms of reasonable equality, she supposed, that mutual confidence might best subsist; she said, that, as Mr Day had decidedly declared his determination to live in perfect seclusion from what is usually called the world, it was fit she should decidedly declare, {{that she would not}} change her present mode of life, with which she had no reason to be dissatisfied, for any dark and untried system, that could be proposed to her.|$|E
5|$|The Actor Rebellion of 1733 was {{an event}} that {{took place at the}} Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London, England when the actors who worked there, disapproving of the changes in the management, {{attempted}} to seize control. Before the rebellion, the theatre was controlled by the managers Theophilus Cibber, John Ellys, and John Highmore. When Theophilus lost his share and was denied a bid to run the theatre, he, along with other actors, attempted to take over the theatre by controlling the lease. When the shareholders found out, they refused to <b>admit</b> <b>the</b> actors to the building and the theatre was closed for several months. The fight spilled over to the contemporary newspapers, which generally sided with the managers.|$|E
5|$|The block {{voting system}} was used, with each peer casting as many votes {{as there were}} seats to be filled. The system, however, {{permitted}} the party with {{the greatest number of}} peers, normally the Conservatives, to procure a disproportionate number of seats, with opposing parties sometimes being left entirely unrepresented. The Lord Clerk Register was responsible for tallying the votes. The return issued by the Lord Clerk Register was sufficient evidence to <b>admit</b> <b>the</b> representative peers to Parliament; however, unlike other peers, Scottish representatives did not receive writs of summons.|$|E

5|$|Confronting Joyce {{about the}} story, Lois {{questions}} her intentions, with Joyce revealing {{that the two}} attended high school together, where she was known as Joyce Chevapravatdumrong. She also reveals that Lois humiliated {{her in front of}} the entire school, by placing a hotdog in her mouth and pulling down her pants while blindfolded (revealing her pink underwear), and has sought revenge ever since. At church the next day, Lois and her family enter, and are immediately demanded to leave by the preacher. Becoming extremely depressed, Lois is eventually coaxed by Brian to face her mistake by showing it to the church. The porno causes the church to reaccept her and <b>admit</b> <b>the</b> Griffin family back into their congregation due to a positive opinion of the film, much to Joyce's anger. Stewie in the meantime develops suspicions of having been conceived through the creation of the porno, heightened when he sees that one of the actors has a football-shaped head like his.|$|E
5|$|The Union Greenback {{convention}} had reconvened {{at nearby}} Farwell Hall and sent an emissary to the National Greenbackers. The delegates voted {{to join the}} other faction in a special conference committee to work for reunification, then adjourned until 7:30 that evening. While {{they waited for the}} committees to finish their work, the delegates listened to speeches by several prominent Greenbackers, including Denis Kearney, a California labor leader, and William Wallace, a Canadian parliamentarian and advocate for currency reform. Meanwhile, the Credentials Committee voted narrowly to <b>admit</b> <b>the</b> Union Greenbackers, as well as a delegation from the Socialist Labor Party. The Committee on Permanent Organization voted to recommend Richard F. Trevellick, a Michigan trade union organizer, as the permanent chairman of the convention. None of the reports were finished by the appointed time, so the convention adjourned again until 10:45 Thursday morning.|$|E

5|$|The Parthenon frieze is the {{defining}} monument of the High Classical style of Attic sculpture. It stands between the gradual {{eclipse of the}} Severe style, as witnessed on the Parthenon metopes, {{and the evolution of}} the Late Classical Rich style, exemplified by the Nike balustrade. What sources the designer of the frieze drew upon is difficult to gauge, certainly large scale narrative art was familiar to 5th-century Athenians as in the Stoa poikile painting by Polygnotos of Thasos. While there is an overall coherence to the work there are design differences on opposing sides of the frieze that has suggested to some scholars the possibility of more than one designer and a pattern of influence amongst them. There is greater nudity and frontally on the north than the south, the massing and distribution of figures is greatly different on the east than the more widely spaced west, and the east and north generally exhibit greater innovation. This evidence, along with the frequency with which Greek artists are thought to have collaborated, has led Jenifer Neils to hypothesize the existence of two designers working on the sculpture. This would <b>admit</b> <b>the</b> possibility of a later designer comparing and competing with the earlier, and so, explain the observable changes in composition. Geographical orientations also may have dictated what would be represented on one side versus another, i.e., Amazons to the west, and so forth.|$|E
5|$|Years go by as Scar squanders the kingdom's {{resources}} and allows his army of hyenas to wreak havoc upon the Pride Lands, which turn barren. Meanwhile, an alive and adult Simba is visited by Mufasa's ghost, who encourages {{him to return}} to the Pride Lands and take his rightful place as king. Aided by his friends Nala, Timon and Pumbaa, Simba arrives at Pride Rock and witnesses Scar striking his mother Sarabi and confronts Scar, who demands that Simba admit to the pride that he killed Mufasa. As he prepares to throw Simba off Pride Rock and have him meet a similar fate to that of his father, Scar whispers that {{he was the one who}} killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba tackles Scar and forces his uncle to <b>admit</b> <b>the</b> truth to the pride, initiating a ferocious battle between the pride, Timon, Pumbaa, Zazu, Rafiki and Scar's hyenas. Scar tries to escape, but is cornered by Simba on the top of Pride Rock; Scar begs for mercy and even attempts to blame his crimes on the hyenas, unaware that they are listening nearby. Simba ignores Scar and gives him one last chance to run away and never return. When Simba's back is turned, Scar attacks him and they fight. Simba bests Scar in combat and throws him over the cliff edge and into a pit. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the vengeful hyenas.|$|E
25|$|In {{a series}} of texts {{published}} in the early 1970s, C.R. Kordig asserted a position somewhere between that of Kuhn and the older philosophy of science. His criticism of the Kuhnian position was that the incommensurability thesis was too radical, and that this {{made it impossible to}} explain the confrontation of scientific theories that actually occurs. According to Kordig, it is in fact possible to <b>admit</b> <b>the</b> existence of revolutions and paradigm shifts in science while still recognizing that theories belonging to different paradigms can be compared and confronted on the plane of observation. Those who accept the incommensurability thesis do not do so because they <b>admit</b> <b>the</b> discontinuity of paradigms, but because they attribute a radical change in meanings to such shifts.|$|E
