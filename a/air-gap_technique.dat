40|$|This thesis {{presents}} microstrip {{patch antenna}} IEEE 802. 16 - 2004 standards for microwave applications and WiMax. Narrow bandwidth (BW) {{is the main}} defect of microstrip patch antenna in wireless communication. The bandwidth can be improved by increasing the substrate thickness, and using air as substrate with low dielectric constant. The antennas were fabricated using FR 4 board. Two types of microstrip antenna were used, {{the first was a}} single microstrip patch antenna and the second was using an <b>air-gap</b> <b>technique</b> as the dielectric between two antenna boards. The spacer of the air-gap has thickness of 2 mm. It was made of wood to separate between the two boards. The transmission line model was used to get the approximate dimension for the design. Different parameters were obtained depending on the simulation and measurement. The Computer Simulations Technology (CST) software was used to simulate the design and the measurement was executed by Vector Network Analyzer (VNA). The two designs were compared to each other and found that some improvements were obtained on the <b>air-gap</b> <b>technique.</b> The bandwidth was improved by 4. 51 % with <b>air-gap</b> <b>technique</b> and only 1. 02 % with the single patch antenna...|$|E
40|$|Improvements for Chip-Chip Interconnects and MEMS Packaging Through Materials and Processing Research Erdal Uzunlar 129 Pages Directed by Dr. Paul A. Kohl The work {{presented}} in this dissertation focuses on improvements for ever-evolving modern microelectronic technology. Specifically, three topics were investigated in this work: electroless copper deposition on printed wiring boards (PWBs), polymer-based air-gap microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) packaging technology, and thermal stability enhancement in sacrificial polymers, such as poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC). In the electroless copper deposition study, Ag-based catalysts were identified as a low-cost and equally active alternative to expensive Pd-based catalysts. Hot H 2 SO 4 treatment of PWBs was found as a non-roughening surface treatment method to minimize electrical losses. In MEMS packaging study, a sacrificial polymer-based <b>air-gap</b> packaging <b>technique</b> was improved in terms of identification and simplification of air-gap formation process options, optimization of thermal treatment steps, assessing air-gap formation performance, and analyzing the chemical composition of residue. It was found that non-photosensitive PPC leaves less residue, and creates more reliable air-gaps. The mechanical strength of air-gaps was found to come from residual stress in benzocyclobutene (BCB) caps. In thermal stability of PPC study, the mechanism of thermal stability increase on copper (Cu) surfaces was found as the complex formation between Cu(I) and iodonium of the photoacid generator (PAG), leading to hindrance of acid formation by PAG and restriction of acid-catalyzed decomposition of PPC.
