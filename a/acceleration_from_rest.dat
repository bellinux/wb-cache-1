These were {{designed}} for hump shunting and so required high tractive effort, good adhesion and traction for starting from rest. Although developed from the 8A tender class, and having some interchangeable parts in their running gear, they also had three cylinders rather than two. The three cylinder tank locomotive was in fashion at this time, {{as a means of}} achieving good <b>acceleration</b> <b>from</b> <b>rest,</b> owing to their more even power delivery and the reduced risk of wheelslip. This three-cylindered pattern had begun with Holden's Decapod of 1902 and carried through into Worsdell and Raven's fast passenger tank locomotives of 4-6-2T and 4-4-4T layout for the North Eastern Railway in 1910 and 1913. Worsdell also designed a comparable heavy shunter of his own, the Class X, although this used the 4-8-0T layout with a leading bogie, rather than trailing.|$|E

Upon acceleration, after a period of idling, the unburned oil and fuel gets sucked up the transfer ports and contributes to an overrich mixture for the first 5 to 10 seconds resulting in a smokescreen from the exhaust. The SRIS plumbing routed the unburned fuel and oil to the next cylinder in the firing order thus allowing it to mix more thoroughly with the incoming charge of that cylinder and lowering the production of visible smoke. Overall fuel and oil consumption was unchanged but visible smoke was greatly reduced on sudden <b>acceleration</b> <b>from</b> <b>rest.</b>|$|E

The rotor is laterally restrained in two orthogonal directions by linear springs and is accelerated by a constant applied torque. It is found that, for a fixed combination of rotor unbalance and lateral stiffnesses, the applied torque must exceed a limiting value in order to accelerate successfully through the critical speed region. With smaller applied torques, after initial <b>acceleration</b> <b>from</b> <b>rest</b> the speed oscillates ontinually about the critical speed and the lateral excursions grow steadily.

Two-stroke motorcycles are lighter and have higher output power in comparison with similar four-stroke ones. In the present project, a two-stroke motorcycle that is used in Iran and is the most powerful has been improved. Its engine is cooled with air and its average fuel (premixed petrol and oil or pet-oil) consumption is 5 liters per hour. The timing ignition in the base engine is constant for all conditions. Then, the effect of the improvement parameter of ignition timing is carefully examined and automatically tuned in terms of engine speed. This modification has been achieved by using a mechanical tuning system based on the governor timing method. Finally, the major emission pollutants ' parameters in modified and base engines are compared according to ECE regulation No. 40. In this effort the following useful results are achieved: a) The fuel consumption has been reduced to 3. 5 liters per hour. b) The UHC emission is reduced by 30 percent with the base engine. c) The movement <b>acceleration</b> <b>from</b> <b>rest</b> condition to 60 kilometers per hour has been remarkably,m, increased in comparison with the base engine...|$|E

40|$|Volatile {{properties}} of particle emissions from four {{compressed natural gas}} (CNG) and four diesel buses were investigated under steady state and transient driving modes on a chassis dynamometer. The exhaust was diluted utilising a full-flow continuous volume sampling system and passed through a thermodenuder at controlled temperature. Particle number concentration and size distribution were measured with a condensation particle counter and a scanning mobility particle sizer, respectively. We show that, while almost all the particles emitted by the CNG buses were in the nanoparticle size range, at least 85 % and 98 % were removed at 100 ºC and 250 ºC, respectively. Closer analysis of the volatility of particles emitted during transient cycles showed that volatilisation began at around 40 °C with the majority occurring by 80 °C. Particles produced during hard <b>acceleration</b> <b>from</b> <b>rest</b> exhibited lower volatility than that produced during other times of the cycle.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} {{of a comprehensive}} theory of force production in insect flight is hindered {{in part by the}} lack of precise knowledge of unsteady forces produced by wings.

The study couples the measurement of lift and drag on a two-dimensional model with simultaneous flow visualization. The results of these experiments are summarized below. 1. At angles of attack below 13. 5 ˚, there was virtually no evidence of a delay in the generation of lift, in contrast to similar studies made at higher Reynolds numbers. 2. At angles of attack above 13. 5 ˚, impulsive movement resulted in the production of a leading edge vortex that stayed attached to the wing for the first 2 chord lengths of travel, resulting in an 80 % increase in lift compared to the performance measured 5 chord lengths later. It is argued that this increase is due to the process of detached vortex lift, analogous to the method of force production in delta-wing aircraft...|$|E

Methods of vacuum laser acceleration are studied and we predict a significant acceleration using two co-propagating lasers where the frequency of the two lasers differ significantly.

In previous works, a four-bar mechanism was studied to get insight into the problem. Regarding the formulation of the equations of motion, it was concluded that the state-space reduction method known as matrix-R is the most suitable one for this application. Regarding the sensors, it was shown that better stability, accuracy and efficiency are obtained as the sensored magnitude is a lower derivative and when it is a generalized coordinate of the problem. In the present work, the automotive problem has been already addressed, through the selection of a Volkswagen Passat as a case-study.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{focuses on}} the {{unexplored}} problem of inferring motion of objects that are invisible to all cameras in a multiple camera setup. As opposed to methods for learning relationships between disjoint cameras, we {{take the next step}} to actually infer the exact spatiotemporal behavior of objects while they are invisible. Given object trajectories within disjoint cameras ’ FOVs (field-ofview), we introduce constraints on the behavior of objects as they travel through the unobservable areas that lie in between. These constraints include vehicle following (the trajectories of vehicles adjacent to each other at entry and exit are time-shifted relative to each other), collision avoidance (no two trajectories pass through the same location at the same time) and temporal smoothness (restricts the allowable movements of vehicles based on physical limits). The constraints are embedded in a generalized, global cost function for the entire scene, incorporating influences of all objects, followed by a bounded minimization using an interior point algorithm, to obtain trajectory representations of objects that define their exact dynamics and behavior while invisible. Finally, a statistical representation of motion in the entire scene is estimated to obtain a probabilistic distribution representing individual behaviors, such as turns, constant velocity motion, deceleration to a stop, and <b>acceleration</b> <b>from</b> <b>rest</b> for evaluation and visualization. Experiments are reported on real world videos from multiple disjoint cameras in NGSIM data set, and qualitative as well as quantitative analysis confirms the validity of our approach. ...|$|E

Conducting polymer actuators are potential candidates for propelling a flapping tail fin for a robotic fish. This study introduces a method for directly measuring the thrust force generated by a polypyrrole (PPy) powered tail fin. The effects of voltage stimulus (waveform shape and frequency) and tail fin shape on the thrust force were determined. A square wave voltage input was shown to generate the highest thrust forces as fast bending actuation was induced. The thrust force tended to decrease at higher operating frequencies {{as a result of the}} reduced actuation occurring in the PPy layers. Increases in the tail fin area tended to lower the frequency where the peak in thrust force was achieved. Tail fin shape was also shown to be important to the force-frequency behaviour. When attached to an untethered robotic fish, the swimming speed tended to increase with increasing voltage input frequency. There was also an optimum frequency that enabled the fastest <b>acceleration</b> <b>from</b> <b>rest</b> that happened to be higher than the frequency that gave the peak thrust force. This was presumed to be due to the complicated swimming behaviour involving the side-to-side movement of the fish nose at low flap frequencies.
