The album was also certified <b>as</b> <b>gold</b> in the US in 2004. Their next three releases, Big Red Car (1995), Wake Up Jeff! (1996) and Wiggly, Wiggly Christmas (1996) had also all received double platinum certifications by 2008. Their eighth studio album, The Wiggles Movie Soundtrack (1997), which doubled as the soundtrack for the group's self-titled feature film, {{was the first to}} enter the ARIA Albums Chart, peaking at number 36 in November 1997.

5|$|Mercury dissolves {{many other}} metals such <b>as</b> <b>gold</b> and silver to form amalgams. Iron is an exception, and iron flasks have {{traditionally}} been used to trade mercury. Several other first row transition metals {{with the exception of}} manganese, copper and zinc are reluctant to form amalgams. Other elements that do not readily form amalgams with mercury include platinum. Sodium amalgam is a common reducing agent in organic synthesis, and is also used in high-pressure sodium lamps.|$|E

5|$|The Little Applegate River's {{watershed}} {{was originally}} settled about 11,000 {{years ago by}} the Latgawa, Shasta, and Dakubetede Native American tribes. The first non-indigenous settlers arrived in the early 19th century. Two boomtowns—Sterlingville and Buncom—were founded in the 1850s and grew rapidly <b>as</b> <b>gold</b> and other precious metals were discovered. They slowly declined in population as the supply of gold was exhausted; only three buildings remain in Buncom, while Sterlingville was abandoned and later destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The Wiggles {{returned}} to the charts with their new line-up, when Apples & Bananas (2014) charted at number 60. The group's forty-seventh album, Nursery Rhymes (2017), peaked at number 15, becoming their highest charting release while in its debut week. The Best of the Wiggles (2016) was the new line-up's first album to be accredited <b>as</b> <b>gold.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{heaviness}} of {{naturally occurring}} metals such <b>as</b> <b>gold,</b> copper, and iron {{may have been}} noticed in prehistory and, {{in light of their}} malleability, led to the first attempts to craft metal ornaments, tools, and weapons. All metals discovered from then until 1809 had relatively high densities; their heaviness was regarded as a singularly distinguishing criterion.|$|E

5|$|Body {{piercing}} jewellery should be hypoallergenic. A number of materials are used, with varying strengths and weaknesses. Surgical stainless steel, niobium and titanium {{are commonly used}} metals, with titanium {{the least likely to}} cause allergic reaction of the three. Platinum and palladium are also safe alternatives, even in fresh piercings. Initial piercings should never be done with gold of any grade, <b>as</b> <b>gold</b> is mixed with other metals, and sterling silver is not a good alternative in a piercing, as it may cause allergies in initial piercings and will tarnish in piercings of any age. An additional risk for allergic reaction may arise when the stud or clasp of jewellery is made from a different metal than the primary piece.|$|E

5|$|Both {{enemies and}} their bullets can be shot down. Defeating enemies will {{sometimes}} reveal item boxes, which can hold precious metals such <b>as</b> <b>gold</b> and silver for extra points, and bombs. Only five bombs {{can be held}} at a time, {{which can be used}} to clear the screen of enemies. Weapon upgrades may appear after defeating certain enemies. These weapons, such as shotguns and machine guns, will increase the player's firing speed or damage output. When a player's bullets hit an enemy, a gauge {{at the bottom of the}} screen will gradually fill. Once filled, the player will be awarded with a Vulcan gun, the most powerful weapon in the game which grants invincibility. The gauge will then begin to deplete and the Vulcan gun will disappear once empty.|$|E

A {{sample of the}} fungus Aspergillus niger was found growing from gold mining solution and was found to contain cyano complexes of such metals <b>as</b> <b>gold,</b> silver, copper, iron, and zinc.

5|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{uses the}} unique molecular recognition properties of DNA and other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties. DNA is thus {{used as a}} structural material {{rather than as a}} carrier of biological information. This has {{led to the creation of}} two-dimensional periodic lattices (both tile-based and using the DNA origami method) and three-dimensional structures in the shapes of polyhedra. Nanomechanical devices and algorithmic self-assembly have also been demonstrated, and these DNA structures have been used to template the arrangement of other molecules such <b>as</b> <b>gold</b> nanoparticles and streptavidin proteins.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} decade of the 19th century, {{minerals}} such <b>as</b> <b>gold</b> were mined with limited success. The last mine was abandoned in 1907, but panning for gold is still allowed in many areas of the forest, and in most circumstances no permit is required. After the end of the mining era, numerous camps were established by the Civilian Conservation Corps to help combat unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The camps housed groups of unemployed men who were paid by the federal government to build roads, hiking trails, and campgrounds for future travelers to the Yellowstone region. Visitation to national forests like Shoshone increased dramatically after World War II with the advent of better roads and accessibility to the region.|$|E

Like Green Grocer, all floors in the Fire Brigade set are fully furnished. The Fire Brigade is the first Modular House to come with a vehicle, the 1930s style fire truck. The set also includes some new, unique pieces, such <b>as</b> <b>gold</b> fire helmets and a red sliding garage door.|$|E
