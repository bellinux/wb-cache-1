50|$|Many {{railways}} {{preferred a}} {{flat bottom rail}} section, where the rails could be laid directly on the sleepers, representing a marked cost saving. Indenting of the sleeper was the problem; where the traffic was heavy, it became necessary to provide <b>a</b> <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> under the rails to spread the load on the tie, partly vitiating the cost saving. However, in main line situations, this form found almost universal adoption in North America and Australia, and in much of continental Europe. The United Kingdom persisted with bullhead rail in main line use, with widespread introduction of flat-bottom rail only starting in about 1947.|$|E

50|$|Spokeshaves can be {{made from}} flat-bottom, concave, or convex soles, {{depending}} on the type of job to be performed. Spokeshaves can include one or more sharpened notches along which the wooden shaft is pulled in order to shave it down to the proper diameter. Historically, spokeshave blades were made of metal, whilst the body and handles were wood. An early design consisted of a metal blade with a pair of tangs to which the wooden handles were attached, as with a drawknife. Unlike a drawknife, but like a plane, spokeshaves typically have <b>a</b> <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> that fixes the angle of the blade relative to the surface being worked. By the twentieth century metal handles and detachable blades had become the most common.|$|E
50|$|To {{assist with}} all-round {{carriage}} traverse, {{there is a}} pivot jack mounted {{at the front of}} the cradle support. The pivot jack is not <b>a</b> <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> and the gun fires with its foam filled rubber tyred wheels supporting the gun on the ground. When the gun is brought into action the pivot jack is folded down and adjusted to be on the ground. If the requires large traverse, small jacks on each trail leg are rotated downwards, and the trails jacked up until the main wheels are lifted clear of the ground and the bogey wheels mounted on each trail leg swung downwards and the trail jacks raised, the carriage is then traversed, and the trail jacks re-used to lift the bogey wheels and then place the piece back on its main wheels.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Advances in {{technology}} and design have generated changes to the traditional track spike. Today, {{there are a number}} of different spike shapes, the four most common being needle, pyramid, post, and Christmas tree and modified Christmas tree (the last two are also referred to as “compression tier”) (see Figure 1). Running magazines, product advertisements, coaches, and manufacturers make claims about the potential effects of each type of spike design and their use in different situations. To our knowledge, these types of claims and other information regarding spikes or track surfaces, have not been tested and reported in the peer-reviewed literature. METHODS: The purpose of this preliminary study was to examine whether different shaped spikes elicit quantifiable differences in energy return on a Mondo track surface, the most commonly used at track venues. Five different shaped spikes all 7 mm in length were used in this study (see Figure # 1). The spikes chosen are those commonly used by athletes on various indoor and outdoor track surfaces. The load-deformation between the spikes the track was measured using a Bose Electroforce 3200 (Eden Praire, MN) testing device. OneWay ANOVAs using Sigma Plot 10. 5 (Systat Inc., Richmond, CA) were performed to test for significant differences between spikes. Tukey post-hoc comparisons were performed at the p= 0. 05 level. RESULTS: Figure 2 shows the ANOVA results [F (4, 49) = 54. 78, p<. 001] and Tukey post-hoc comparison for the energy returned. The MTREE spike generated the greatest amount of energy returned and was significantly different from the other spikes (p<= 0. 05). The PYRA spike generated second largest amount of energy returned and was significant different from the PIN and POST spikes. The PIN or needle spike, as expected, had the least amount of energy returned. All spikes penetrated the track surface. DISCUSSION: The notion that compression spikes have less track penetration is unfounded. All the spikes tested penetrated the track under loads less than 105 N. Considering that vertical ground reaction force (GRF) increases linearly during walking and running from 1. 2 BW to approximately 2. 5 BW at 6. 0 m s− 1 and remains constant during forward lean sprinting at higher speeds, the likehood of any of the tested spikes not penetrating the Mondo track surface seems improbable (Keller et al., 1996). For the Mondo track the spike with the largest energy return was the MTREE design. This MTREE provided the largest spike surface area, which helped it to compress the track. The common PIN design provided the least energy return but absorbed the least amount of energy. All the compression spikes seem to provide larger amounts of energy return when compared to the PIN. The measured energy returned by the various spikes is relatively small (N*mm). However, for this study, the energy return was determined for only one spike while most sprint shoes have <b>a</b> <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> with up to 10 mounted spikes. While it is difficult to assess how much of the energy returned in the spike-track surface interaction might actually aid the sprinter, these findings are nevertheless noteworthy. It is not uncommon for results in sprint races to be separated by only thousandths of a second, where even small levels of energy return could potentially make the difference between winning or losing a race. CONCLUSION: This study shows that spike design affects the amount of energy returned and absorbed by a Mondo track surface. While all of the spikes tested penetrated the track surface, the modified Christmas tree design returned the most energy on the Mondo surface. Knowledge of which spike design offers the highest energy return on the various track surfaces that athletes compete on could be useful to coaches and athletes, as well as, spike and track manufacturers and thus is worthy of further investigation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Some {{in vitro}} studies warn {{combining}} different metals in orthopedic surgery. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the impact of combining titanium and stainless steel on bone healing and the clinical course of patients undergoing internal fixation of femoral fractures. Materials and Methods: 69 patients with femoral fractures had polyaxial locking plate osteosynthesis. The locking plate was made of a titanium alloy. Two different cohorts were defined: (<b>a)</b> <b>sole</b> <b>plating</b> and (b) additional stainless steel cerclage wiring. Postoperative radiographs and clinical followup were performed at 6 weeks, 3 months and 12 months. Results: Cohorts A and B had 36 and 33 patients, respectively. Patient demographics and comorbidities were similar in both groups. In two cases in cohort A, surgical revision was necessary. No complication could be attributed to the combination of titanium and stainless steel. Conclusion: The combination of stainless steel cerclage wires and titanium plates does not compromise fracture healing or the postoperative clinical course...|$|R

50|$|Artistic roller skaters most {{commonly}} skate on traditional quad skates. Skates designed for artistic skating typically have leather boots, <b>a</b> strong <b>sole</b> <b>plate,</b> and <b>a</b> jump bar for reinforcement. The plate {{has to be}} made from a strong material as it {{has to be able to}} withstand the shock of jumping and landing. Artistic roller skates usually have stainless steel or aluminum plates for that reason, even though these are heavier than ones made from other materials such as plastic. Free skaters usually use a toe stop, which can be used in the take-off in certain jumps such as the Mapes or the flip. Dance skaters substitute toe plugs, as the large toe stops are cumbersome when performing dance footwork. Figure skaters generally have specially made plates for figure skating which have no receptacle for the toe stop.|$|R
50|$|The 1917 Trench Boot was an {{adaptation}} of the boots American manufacturers were selling to the French and Belgian armies {{at the beginning of}} World War I. In American service, it replaced the Russet Marching Shoe. The boot was made of tanned cowhide with <b>a</b> half middle <b>sole</b> covered by <b>a</b> full <b>sole.</b> Iron <b>plates</b> were fixed to the heel. It was a great improvement, however it lacked waterproofing. It soon evolved into the 1918 Trench Boot, also called the Pershing Boot after General John Pershing, who oversaw its creation. The boot used heavier leather in its construction, and had several minor changes from the 1917 Boot.|$|R

50|$|Control is {{an issue}} with jigsaws. The blades are small, weak and entirely {{unsupported}} at the lower end. Good cut control requires the presence of blade rollers, which keep the blade aligned just above the <b>sole</b> <b>plate.</b> Heavy cast <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> saws are somewhat better than pressed steel for sawing line control too. To guide a jigsaw on curved cut, it must be steered (turned) and not forced to move sideways. The usage of sharp blades is important as well to get high quality cuts.|$|R

40|$|By {{means of}} thin (≤ 150 nm) and thick (> 150 nm) sections, {{the shape and}} {{position}} of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and of the Golgi apparatus in the <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> and in the remaining subsarcolemmal sarcoplasmic region were investigated. For this purpose the membranes were stained by means of imidazole-osmium postfixation and unstained sections analyzed under the electron microscope. Both in the sarcoplasma of the <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> and around the muscle fiber nuclei, a network of tubules is visible after imidazole-osmium staining which can be identified as the sarcoplasmic reticulum {{solely on the basis}} of its contacts with the perinuclear cistern and the cisterns of the triads. Findings in literature on the position of the Golgi apparatus are confirmed and similar spatial relationships and vesiculations between the perinuclear cisterns and the Golgi apparatus of the <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> nuclei and the other subsarcolemmal fiber nuclei are also demonstrated using this new staining method...|$|R
50|$|These boots {{have also}} been {{released}} in the Miracle, Glide, and Victory versions, all version III (three). Although it appears that {{all three of the}} lower versions have at least a little bit of fiberglass on their <b>sole</b> <b>plate,</b> except for the Victory versions, it is actually just a sticker to improve marketing ability. The sticker on Miracle version has a zig-zag design on the fiberglass, the Glide versions have a sticker {{down the middle of the}} <b>sole</b> <b>plate,</b> but with no design in it, and as mentioned before, the Victory version has no sticker on its soleplate.

2500|$|There are two {{standard}} {{types of}} router—plunge and fixed. When using a plunge-base router, {{the sole of}} the base {{is placed on the}} face of the work with the cutting bit raised above the work, then the motor is turned on and the cutter is lowered into the work. [...] With a fixed-base router, the cut depth is set before the tool is turned on. [...] The <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> is then either rested flat on the workpiece overhanging the edge so that the cutting bit is not contacting the work (and then entering the work from the side once the motor is turned on), or the <b>sole</b> <b>plate</b> is placed at an angle with the bit above the work and the bit is [...] "rocked" [...] over into the work once the motor is turned on. [...] In each case, the bit cuts its way in, but the plunge router does it in a more refined way, although the bit used must be shaped so it bores into the wood when lowered.|$|R

This eliminated the need for a hard shell on the boot; the Nava boot was soft and resembled a knee-high winter boot. In spite of numerous endorsements by racing stars, the system never caught on and sales ended by the late 1980s.|$|R
