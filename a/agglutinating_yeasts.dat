40|$|A {{total of}} 393 {{clinical}} bacterial isolates were tested {{for their ability}} to <b>agglutinate</b> <b>yeast</b> cells of either Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Candida albicans. A positive agglutination of yeasts that could be prevented by methyl alpha-D-mannoside was taken as an indication for the possible presence of a mannose-specific lectin (carbohydrate-binding protein) {{on the surface of the}} tested bacteria. Agglutination tests on glass slides showed that 38 % of all the isolates tested were positive in their capacity to <b>agglutinate</b> <b>yeasts.</b> Among the various strains tested, all isolates of Serratia marcescens, Proteus morganii, and Citrobacter diversus, as well as 94 % of Klebsiella pneumoniae, were positive. On the other hand, only 46 % of the Escherichia coli, 48 % of the salmonellae, 44 % of the Citrobacter freundii, and 71 % of the Aeromonas hydrophila isolates were positive. A quantitative determination of the lectin activity done by observing the agglutination of yeasts in microtiter plates showed that S. marcescens isolates were the most avid binders to the yeast, whereas Klebsiella and Citrobacter isolates were the weakest...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} and secretion of the humoral opsonin {{from the}} colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri was studied by using specific polyclonal antibodies that recognise {{both of the}} bands obtained after SDS-PAGE of the purified lectin. The agglutinin was revealed {{on the surface of}} <b>agglutinated</b> <b>yeast</b> and red blood cells and in the cytoplasm of the phagocytes, either uniformly distributed or localised inside the cytoplasmic projections. A previous incubation of haemocytes with the agglutinin resulted in intense labelling of the surface that disappeared in the presence of D-galactose, whereas it was not affected by treatment with proteases. These results, together with the already published data, suggest that our molecule is a new member of the galectin family...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of a shear {{supernatant}} from flocculent, "fimbriated" Saccharomyces cerevisiae brewer's yeast cells {{revealed the}} presence of a protein involved in flocculation of the yeast cells and therefore designated a flocculin. The molecular mass of the flocculin was estimated to be over 300 kDa, as judged from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel permeation chromatography of the flocculin yielded an aggregate with an apparent molecular weight of > 2, 000. The flocculin was found to be protease sensitive, and the sequence of its 16 N-terminal amino acids revealed at least 69 % identity with the predicted N terminus of the putative protein encoded by the flocculation gene FLO 1. The flocculin was isolated from flocculent S. cerevisiae cells, whereas only a low amount of flocculin, if any, could be isolated from nonflocculent cells. The flocculin was found to stimulate the flocculation ability of flocculent yeast cells without displaying lectinlike activity (that is, the ability to <b>agglutinate</b> <b>yeast</b> cells) ...|$|R
40|$|Serratia marcescens US 46, a human {{urinary tract}} isolate, {{exhibits}} mannose-resistant hemagglutination and <b>agglutinates</b> <b>yeast</b> cells, thereby indicating {{that it has}} two types of adhesins. We constructed a cosmid library for the DNA of this organism and isolated DNA clones carrying genes for mannose-sensitive (MS) and mannose-resistant (MR) fimbriae. On introduction of the cloned genes into Escherichia coli K- 12, MS and MR fimbriae were formed. These fimbriae were functionally and morphologically indistinguishable from those of S. marcescens. Subcloning of these gene clusters revealed that the genes encoding MS fimbriae reside on a 9 -kilobase (kb) DNA fragment, while those encoding MR fimbriae are present on a 12 -kb fragment. Transposon insertion and maxicell analyses revealed that formation of MR fimbriae is controlled by several genes which reside on the 9 -kb fragment. The nucleotide sequence of smfA, the gene encoding the major structural component of MR fimbriae, revealed that this gene encodes a 174 -amino-acid polypeptide with a typical procaryotic signal peptide. The primary structure of the smfA product showed significant homology with the primary structure of the E. coli fimbrial subunit...|$|R
40|$|The haemagglutinating {{ability of}} 141 {{isolates}} of Aeromonas spp. for human, horse and guinea-pig erythrocytes was examined. Although {{the majority of}} isolates (136 / 141) agglutinated human group O erythrocytes, all the eight possible patterns of agglutination were observed. Haemagglutination of human group O erythrocytes, but not horse or guinea-pig, {{was associated with the}} ability to <b>agglutinate</b> <b>yeast</b> cells (Saccharomyces) and with aggregation in a low concentration of ammonium sulphate. Haemagglutinating ability was further characterized by reactions in the presence of mannose, galactose or fucose. All the possible patterns of inhibition with individual sugars were observed, but haemagglutination of human group O erythrocytes not inhibited by mannose, galactose or fucose was more common among isolates from patients with diarrhoea, and isolates producing a Vero cell cytotoxin than would be expected by chance. This might represent a virulence factor. When used as a typing system haemagglutination patterns did not correspond with the clustering of isolates expected on epidemiological grounds. Repeated subculturing resulted in a loss of agglutinating ability, {{an increase in the number}} of sugars inhibiting haemagglutination and an increase in the salt concentration required for aggregation. Haemagglutination did not seem to be useful as a means of typing aeromonads...|$|R
40|$|Static {{broth culture}} favors Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium to produce type 1 fimbriae, while solid agar {{inhibits}} its expression. A transposon inserted in stbC, which would encode an usher for Stb fimbriae of a non-flagellar Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium LB 5010 strain, conferred it to <b>agglutinate</b> <b>yeast</b> cells on both cultures. RT-PCR {{revealed that the}} expression of the fimbrial subunit gene fimA, and fimZ, a regulatory gene of fimA, were both increased in the stbC mutant when grown on LB agar; fimW, a repressor gene of fimA, exhibited lower expression. Flagella were observed in the stbC mutant and this phenotype was correlated with the motile phenotype. Microarray data and RT-PCR indicated that the expression of three genes, motA, motB, and cheM, was enhanced in the stbC mutant. The stbC mutant was resistant to several antibiotics, consistent with the finding that expression of yhcQ and ramA was enhanced. A complementation test revealed that transforming a recombinant plasmid possessing the stbC restored the mannose-sensitive agglutination phenotype to the stbC mutant much as that in the parental Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium LB 5010 strain, indicating the possibility of an interplay of different fimbrial systems in coordinating their expression...|$|R
40|$|FimH {{protein is}} a lectin-like {{adhesive}} subunit of type 1, or mannose-sensitive, fimbriae {{that are found}} {{on the surface of}} most Escherichia coli strains. All naturally occurring FimH variants demonstrate a conserved mannotriose-specific (i. e. multivalent) binding. Here, we demonstrate that replacement of residues 185 - 279 within the FimH pilin domain with a corresponding segment of the type 1 C fimbrial adhesin FocH leads to a loss of the multivalent mannotriose-specific binding property accompanied by the acquisition of a distinct monomannose-specific (i. e. monovalent) binding capability. Bacteria expressing the monovalent hybrid adhesins were capable of binding strongly to uroepithelial tissue culture cells and guinea pig erythrocytes. They could not, however, <b>agglutinate</b> <b>yeast</b> or bind human buccal cells functions readily accomplished by the E. coli-expressing mannotriose-specific FimH variants. Based on the relative potency of inhibiting compounds of different structures, the receptor binding site within monovalent FimH-FocH adhesin has an extended structure with an overall configuration similar to that within the multivalent FimH of natural origin. The monomannose-only specific phenotype could also be invoked by a single point mutation, E 89 K, located within the lectin domain of FimH, but distant from the receptor binding site. The structural alterations influence the receptor-binding valency of the FimH adhesin via distal effects on the combining pocket, obviously by affecting the FimH quaternary structure...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we assayed protein iodination in human granulocytes after {{interaction}} of the cells with mannose-specific (MS) type 1 fimbriated (MS+) and nonfimbriated (MS-) phenotypes of Escherichia coli pretreated with various amounts of anti-E. coli and antifimbrial antibodies. The MS+ phenotype stimulated protein iodination in granulocytes and possessed potent MS activity as measured by yeast aggregometry. In contrast, the MS- phenotype lacked all these activities. MS+ pretreated with moderate concentrations of antibodies, however, showed up to a 15 -fold increase in granulocyte stimulation as compared to granulocyte stimulation induced by the non-antibody-treated MS+ phenotype or by the antibody-treated MS- phenotype. This marked antibody-mediated increase in stimulation of granulocytes was (i) dependent on the antibody concentrations, (ii) markedly reduced by methyl-alpha-D-mannoside, (iii) caused by immunoglobulin G {{as well as by}} F(ab') 2, (iv) caused only by antifimbrial antibodies, (v) associated with cross-linked fimbriae seen as "bundles" under an electron microscope, and (vi) mimicked by treating MS+ bacteria with a certain range of glutaraldehyde. The data taken together support the hypothesis that, although cross-linking of fimbriae reduced the density of functional MS fimbriae over the surface of antibody-treated bacteria and consequently reduced the ability of these organisms to <b>agglutinate</b> <b>yeast</b> cells, the resulting bundles of MS fimbriae were far more effective at stimulating granulocytes because, bound together, they were better equipped to aggregate the mannose-containing receptors on the granulocyte surface...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{determine}} probiotic properties, 137 strains of lactic acid bacteria from the feces of Creole goats were screened, only six were resistant to pH 2. 0 and bile salts (0. 3 %). Three strains identified as Lactobacillus and two as Enterococcus showed agglutination with the treated yeast. Between them, Lactobacillus DDL 17, DDL 19, DDL 48 and Enterococcus DDE 39 demonstrated high specificity in this test because the correspondent agglutination was inhibited by one sugar, suggesting {{the presence of a}} lectin-like structure in their cell walls, which could be due to adhesion ability. Another Enterococcus strain (DDE 55) showed low affinity because five sugars inhibited the agglutination of the treated yeasts. The results of hydrophobic properties showed that the strains who were able to <b>agglutinate</b> <b>yeasts</b> presented similar hydrophobic characteristics as hexadecane, xylene and toluene, but high specificity was not related to a high hydrophobicity. Only two strains (Lactobacillus DDL 19 and DDL 48) showed aggregation with the lowest concentration of ammonium sulfate, complementing the hydrophobicity assay. Only one strain, Lactobacillus DDL 48, showed an inhibition against an enteric indicator strain (Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli O 111). This inhibitory action was not affected by the addition of catalase and no inhibition was detected after neutralizing the supernatant culture fluid. These strains could be pre-selected in order to complete studies focused on designing a probiotic for use in goat feed...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} growth {{temperature}} on {{the loss of}} virulence of the fish pathogen Aeromonas salmonicida was investigated. Three virulent strains were grown in Trypticase soy broth at temperatures ranging from 22 to 30 degrees C. Growth at a higher-than-optimal temperature (26 to 27 degrees C for the three strains studied) resulted {{in the selection of}} spontaneous attenuated derivatives in the initial bacterial population. For example, virulent bacteria represented less than 10 % of the population of a culture grown at 30 degrees C, and attenuated derivatives were easily isolated by streaking the culture on solid medium and picking single colonies. Virulent strains autoaggregated during growth and possessed a cell wall layer (A-layer) external to the outer membrane, as previously described. Attenuated strains did not autoaggregate and did not possess the A-layer. The A-layer apparently shielded bacteriophage receptors and a mannose-specific yeast agglutinin located in the outer membrane. Thus, virulent strains exhibited impaired adsorption of phages, whereas attenuated strains were phage sensitive. Furthermore, attenuated strains <b>agglutinated</b> <b>yeast</b> cells but virulent strains did not. The attenuated strains had higher maximum growth temperatures than their virulent parent strains, and this accounts for their selection at high temperatures. It is proposed that the A-layer contributes significantly to the physical properties of the A. salmonicida cell envelope and that these physical properties of the A. salmonicida cell envelope and that these physical change upon loss of the A-layer to permit growth at a higher-than-usual temperature...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{adherence}} of both laboratory and wild-type Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, isolated from sputum, urine, and stool samples, to human buccal and intestinal and urinary tract epithelial cells. Of 32 unencapsulated strains, 30 adhered to all epithelial cells tested. Four K. pneumoniae strains lysogenic for AP 3, a phage which causes conversion to resistance of coliphages T 3, T 7, and phi I, were all unable to adhere to epithelial cells. One of these strains was cured from phage infection and became capable of adhering, Spontaneous mutants resistant to coliphage T 7, as well as K. pneumoniae K 59 -sensitive cells preadsorbed with inactivated T 7 particles, did not adhere to epithelial cells. All strains capable of adhering were able to adsorb coliphage T 7 and T 3, whereas all nonadhesive strains were not. AP 3 -like prophages were induced from 7 of 12 nonadhesive Klebsiella strains. A laboratory strain which was able to adhere was lysogenized with 2 of these phages. In both cases, the strain lost its ability to adsorb coliphages T 3, T 7, and phi I and to adhere to human epithelial cells. All K. pneumoniae adhesive strains <b>agglutinated</b> <b>yeast</b> cells, whereas the nonadhesive strains did not. Competition {{studies have shown that}} D-mannose and concanavalin A prevented adherence to human epithelial cells, yeast agglutination, and adsorption of coliphage T 7 to K. pneumoniae cells.

Mannose-sensitive hemagglutination, mannose-resistant hemagglutination, and non-agglutinating strains were recognized. The three V. ordalii strains showed mannose-resistant hemagglutination, whereas V. anguillarum exhibited either mannose-sensitive hemagglutination or was non-agglutinating. Among V. anguillarum, sensitivity to d-galactose and l-fucose occurred sporadically.

The widths of these fimbriae were 7, 4. 5, and 3 nm, respectively. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified fimbriae showed three bands with molecular weights of 21, 000, 20, 000, and 19, 000, respectively. This strain had mannose-resistant (MR) hemagglutinating activity and was <b>agglutinated</b> by <b>yeast</b> cells. Therefore, strain US 46 {{appeared to have}} both MR and mannose-sensitive fimbriae. In the immunoblot analysis, all MAbs reacted with the 20, 000 -molecular-weight subunit when given a choice of three differently sized subunits. Immunoelectron microscopy showed these MAbs attached to the MR fimbriae with the largest width (7 nm). The antigenic cross-reactivity of fimbriae was examined by an MAb-mediated agglutination test. All MR strains of S. marcescens and some mannose-sensitive strains were agglutinated by the MAbs. The serological homogeneity of MR fimbriae was confirmed by a spot test, using the crude purified fimbriae from several MR strains of S. marcescens.

To explore this hypothesis, E. coli expressing P, type 1, S, colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I), or CFA/II fimbriae was grown {{in the presence of}} salicylate, bismuth salts, NaCl, and nonfermented sugars. Tetracycline-resistant clones were derived from several P-fimbriated strains. The bacteria were tested for the ability to <b>agglutinate</b> erythrocytes, <b>yeast</b> cells, and alpha-D-Gal(- 4) -beta-D-Gal-bonded latex (Gal-Gal) beads and were examined for fimbriae by electron microscopy. Hyperosmolar conditions decreased fimbrial expression for all strains. Expression of P fimbriae by pyelonephritic strains, all of which were OmpF+, was reversibly repressed by salicylate and bismuth salts. CFA strains were similarly affected. Tetracycline-resistant P-fimbriated strains were OmpF deficient, were unable to agglutinate erythrocytes and Gal-Gal beads, and lacked fimbriae as observed by electron microscopy. Strains with plasmid-encoded P-fimbrial genes did not demonstrate OmpF on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles and were not affected by salicylate. The type 1 -fimbriated phenotype was not affected by salicylate or bismuth unless the strains also expressed P fimbriae. S-fimbriated strains were not affected.

The haemagglutinating bacteria adhered to the red cells and bound them together. All strains in group I showed the same pattern of activity, agglutinating most species of red cells strongly, human cells moderately strongly, sheep and goat cells weakly, and ox cells not at all.

40|$|The {{capacity}} of 453 Escherichia coli strains to <b>agglutinate</b> erythrocytes and <b>yeast</b> cells and to attach to human urinary tract epithelial cells was tested. The strains were {{isolated from the}} urine of patients with acute pyelonephritis, acute cystitis, or asymptomatic bacteriuria and from the stools of healthy school children. Three main patterns of hemagglutination were found: (i) mannose-resistant agglutination of human erythrocytes alone or simultaneously with mannose-sensitive agglutination of guinea pig erythrocytes; (ii) only mannose-sensitive agglutination of guinea pig and other erythrocytes; and (iii) no agglutination. Strains with mannose-resistant agglutination of human erythrocytes alone or in combination with mannose-sensitive hemagglutination attached in high numbers to human urinary tract epithelial cells. Bacteria inducing only mannose-sensitive hemagglutination attached in low numbers, and non-agglutinating strains did not bind to the urinary tract epithelial cells. The bacterial surface antigen(s) mediating mannose-resistant hemagglutination of human erythrocytes and attachment to human urinary tract epithelial cells may be one factor selecting for E. coli from among the fecal flora which infect the urinary tract. The highest proportion of strains with this property was found among acute pyelonephritis isolates (77 %), and the lowest proportion of strains with this property was found among normal fecal E. coli (16 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Microbiology)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. One {{of the key}} {{selection}} criteria for potential probiotics {{is the ability to}} adhere and colonise the host gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Probiotics compete for receptor sites at the host intestinal surface, preventing the colonisation of pathogens, thereby protecting the host from infection. In addition, several important intestinal functions are mediated by the binding of probiotics to host tissue. However, the molecular mechanisms and genotypic characterization of adhesive elements have not received as much attention as other aspects of probiotic research. The present study aims to contribute to this area of research. The first part of the study focused on monitoring the expression of mucus adhesion genes mub, mapA, adhesion-like factor EF-Tu and bacteriocin gene plaA of Lactobacillus plantarum 423, as well as mub, surface layer protein (slp) and EF-Tu of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 when grown in the presence of mucin, bile, pancreatin and at low pH. Real time PCR was used. mub, mapA and EF-Tu of strain 423 were up-regulated in the presence of mucus and expression increased under increasing concentrations of mucus. Expression of mapA was up-regulated under normal gut conditions (0. 3 %, w/v, bile; 0. 3 %, w/v, pancreatin; pH 6. 5) and at higher levels of bile (1. 0 %, w/v) and pancreatin (1. 0 %, w/v). Expression of mub was downregulated in the presence of bile and pancreatin at pH 6. 5, whilst the expression of EFTu and plaA remained unchanged. At pH 4. 0, the expression of mub and mapA remained unchanged, whilst EF-Tu and plaA were up-regulated. Expression of mapA was down-regulated in the presence of 0. 1 % (w/v) cysteine, suggesting that the gene is regulated by a mechanism of transcription attenuation that involves cysteine. In the case of L. acidophilus ATCC 4356, none of the genes were up-regulated under increasing concentrations of mucin, whilst only slp and EF-Tu were up-regulated under normal and stressful gut conditions in vitro. In {{the second part of the}} study, male Wistar rats were used to evaluate which section of the gastrointestinal tract are colonised by L. plantarum 423 and Enterococcus mundtii ST 4 SA and determine the effect of adhesion. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) incorporating strain specific oilgonucleotide probes indicated strong fluorescent signals for L. plantarum 423 along the intestinal lining of the ileum and the cecum. L. plantarum 423 did not colonise the colon as indicated by real timePCR. Fluorescent signals were recorded for E. mundtii ST 4 SA across the epithelial barrier of cecum and colonic tissue, suggesting that translocation took place. Real time PCR revealed highest cell numbers of strain ST 4 SA in the cecum and the colon. Haemotoxylin eosin staining of rat tissue revealed no change in morphology or any toxic effects induced upon adhesion of the strains. 16 S rDNA PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) revealed a decrease in enterobacterial species whilst the lactic acid bacterial content remained unchanged. Strains 423 and ST 4 SA <b>agglutinated</b> <b>yeast</b> cells in vitro, indicating the possible presence of mannose receptors. It is well known that these receptors play a crucial role in the elimination of type 1 fimbriated strains of E. coli. It is thus safe to speculate that mannose receptors may have played a role in diminishing the enterobacterial content in the gut. The third part of the study encompassed characterization of cell surface proteins of L. plantarum 423 and their role in adhesion to Caco- 2 cell lines. The strain lacks the typical surface layer protein whilst a multifunctional “intracellular” protein, elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and glycolytic enzymes glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) were detected. Removal of surface proteins reduced adherence of strain 423 to Caco- 2 cell lines by 40 %, suggesting that these proteins play a role in adhesion. The ability of strain 423 to competitively adhere, exclude and displace Clostridium sporogenes LMG 13570 and Enterococcus faecalis LMG 13566 from Caco- 2 cell lines, was studied. Adhesion of C. sporogenes LMG 13570 and E. faecalis LMG 13566 was inhibited by 70 % and 90 %, respectively. Strain 423 excluded C. sporogenes LMG 13570 from Caco- 2 cells by 73 % and displaced the pathogen by 80 %. E. faecalis LMG 13566 was excluded by 60 % and displaced from Caco- 2 cells by 90 %. Despite removal of the surface proteins, L. plantarum 423 was still capable of competitively adhering to Caco- 2 cells and reduced adherence of C. sporogenes LMG 13570 by 50 % and E. faecalis LMG 13566 by 70 %...|$|R
