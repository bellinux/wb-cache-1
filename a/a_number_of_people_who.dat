5|$|There are {{multiple}} {{stories of the}} birth of The Satanic Bible. In the introduction to the 2005–present edition, High Priest Peter H. Gilmore describes LaVey as having compiled The Satanic Bible on his own from monographs he had written about the Church of Satan and its rituals. Gilmore lists <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> influenced LaVey's writings: Ayn Rand, Friedrich Nietzsche, H. L. Mencken, the members of the carnival with whom LaVey had supposedly worked in his youth, P. T. Barnum, Mark Twain, John Milton, and Lord Byron.|$|E
5|$|His {{military}} career began in January 1678 when Paulet purchased for him an ensign's commission in the Holland Regiment, {{in which he}} saw service against the French in Flanders. The regiment saw no combat, and was disbanded {{at the end of}} the year. In July 1680 he purchased a staff lieutenant's commission in the newly formed 2nd Tangier Regiment, which was sent to English Tangier to reinforce the garrison holding the city. Tangier's council was then headed by the Duke of York (later King James II), and its governor was Colonel Percy Kirke. Nicholson distinguished himself in the service, carrying dispatches between the enemy Moroccan camp, Tangier, and London. In addition to favorable notice from Kirke, this brought Nicholson to the attention of the powerful colonial secretary, William Blathwayt. Tangier was abandoned in 1683, and his regiment returned to England. During the service in Tangier he met <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> would figure prominently North American colonial history, including Thomas Dongan and Alexander Spotswood.|$|E

25|$|This vow was {{observed}} into the intertestamental period (the interval between {{the writing of}} the Hebrew Bible and {{the writing of the}} Christian New Testament). 1 Maccabees (part of the Christian Deuterocanon) 3:49 mentions men who had ended their nazirite vows, an example dated to about 166 BCE. Josephus mentions <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had taken the vow, such as his tutor Banns (Antiquities 20.6), and Gamaliel records in the Mishna how the father of Rabbi Chenena made a lifetime nazirite vow before him (Nazir 29b).|$|E

This motivated her to gain some respectability for herself, which she did by going to Paris. There, she met entertainer Loie Fuller and through Fuller, other artists, most notably Auguste Rodin.

25|$|The society {{during the}} time of Muhammad was {{predominantly}} oral and for this reason he would recite the Quranic verses to his Companions and instruct them to memorize it. Due to this, people question whether the Quran was ever written and collected {{during the time}} of Muhammad. While writing was not a common skill during Muhammad’s time, Mecca, being the commercial center, had <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> could write. Some scholars believe that up to 48 scribes including Zayd ibn Thabit and Ubay ibn Ka'b recorded verses of the Quran. This provides an explanation as to how the Quran existed in written form during the life of Muhammad, even if it was not compiled into one text.|$|E
25|$|Keenly {{aware of}} the need to seize the {{initiative}} and to get the process under firm judicial control, de Gaulle appointed Justice Minister François de Menthon to lead the Legal Purge (Épuration légale) to punish traitors and to clear away the traces of the Vichy regime. Knowing that he would need to reprieve many of the 'economic collaborators'—such as police and civil servants who held minor roles under Vichy {{in order to keep the}} country running as normally as possible—he assumed, as head of state, the right to commute death sentences. Of the near 2,000 people who received the death sentence from the courts, fewer than 800 were executed. De Gaulle commuted 998 of the 1,554 capital sentences submitted before him, including all those involving women. Many others were given jail terms or had their voting rights and other legal privileges taken away. It is generally agreed that the purges were conducted arbitrarily, with often absurdly severe or overly lenient punishments being handed down. It was also notable that the less well-off people who were unable to pay for lawyers were more harshly treated. As time went by and feelings grew less intense, <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had held fairly senior positions under the Vichy government—such as Maurice Papon and René Bousquet—escaped consequences by claiming to have worked secretly for the resistance or to have played a double game, working for the good of France by serving the established order.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, on Cowell's recommendation, Cage {{drove to}} San Francisco to find {{employment}} {{and to seek}} out fellow Cowell student and composer Lou Harrison. According to Cowell, the two composers had a shared interest in percussion and dance and would likely hit it off if introduced to one another. Indeed, the two immediately established a strong bond upon meeting and began a working relationship that continued for several years. Harrison soon helped Cage to secure a faculty member position at Mills College, teaching the same program as at UCLA, and collaborating with choreographer Marian van Tuyl. Several famous dance groups were present, and Cage's interest in modern dance grew further. After several months he left and moved to Seattle, Washington, where he found work as composer and accompanist for choreographer Bonnie Bird at the Cornish College of the Arts. The Cornish School years {{proved to be a}} particularly important period in Cage's life. Aside from teaching and working as accompanist, Cage organized a percussion ensemble that toured the West Coast and brought the composer his first fame. His reputation was enhanced further with the invention of the prepared piano—a piano which has had its sound altered by objects placed on, beneath or between the strings—in 1940. This concept was originally intended for a performance staged in a room too small to include a full percussion ensemble. It was also at the Cornish School that Cage met <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> became lifelong friends, such as painter Mark Tobey and dancer Merce Cunningham. The latter was to become Cage's lifelong romantic partner and artistic collaborator.|$|E

500|$|Although Mass Effect 2 was {{primarily}} developed at BioWare's Edmonton studio, {{a new team}} of 30 people was set to work at EA Montreal in March 2009 to supplement the teams already working on the game. The new team was composed of <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> worked on the original game, but the majority was new hires. Overall, Mass Effect 2 was developed {{over the course of}} roughly two years and more than 150 people worked on the game. Hudson mentioned two significant challenges that interfered with the development: the 2008–2012 global recession limited the game's budget, and the team had to get through it without impacting their ambitious goals. Additionally, due to the 2009 flu pandemic, {{a significant part of the}} team was ill during the last months of development, resulting in a loss of a man-year of time. Despite these factors, Hudson described the development of Mass Effect 2 as successful [...] "on time, on budget, and exceeding quality goals." ...|$|E

500|$|On Kreamer Island, many {{residents}} received {{information about the}} storm when {{it was too late}} to evacuate. In some homes, 20–30 people sought shelter inside and later stood on tables and chairs to remain above the water. Most of the homes were swept away into rows of pine trees and others more than half a mile (0.8km) away. Despite this, only one person drowned on the island. Residents of Torry Island also did not have ample time to prepare for the storm. They attempted to evacuate, but the causeway was already inundated, forcing twenty-three people to seek refuge in a packinghouse. Floodwaters entered the building, forcing the occupants into the rafters. However, the building was eventually pushed into a nearby canal. Ten people drowned, but thirteen others survived by clinging to a barge or tree tops, while one woman tied herself to a telegraph pole.

500|$|The Dumas's {{business}} and those like it were criticized by <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> sought {{to reform the}} red light district. Reverend William Biederwolf condemned Butte as [...] "the lowest sinkhole of vice in the west," [...] and that he saw [...] "enough legitimate vice in Butte to damn the souls of every young man and young woman in it." [...] Biederwolf held revival services for residents which attracted [...] "rounders, gamblers and habitués of the red light district". However, the local business benefited and even depended on {{the support of the}} sex workers at the Dumas and other establishments like it. The prostitutes would buy their dresses at local clothiers, frequent the city's dry cleaners and would patronize Chinese herbalists, looking for birth control potions and venereal disease remedies. To ensure that their operations were unhampered, the girls at the Dumas would pay the city's police and governance five dollar [...] "fines". Instead of the closing or relocating the red light district, the mayor and police of Butte ordered that the women wear longer skirts and high-necked blouses and that they [...] "refrain from any indecent exposures." [...] After these ordinances were put in place, the Butte Miner reported that [...] "nothing was seen in the district except long dresses and long faces. What the women say about the matter is not fit for publication." [...] By 1910 the people were petitioning Mayor Charles Nevin to shut down the district; with the district contributing two thousand dollars to the city's coffers every month, the efforts eventually died.|$|E
