500|$|The {{most notable}} {{aspect of his}} songwriting {{involved}} {{the wide range of}} genres that he used, which included, among other styles, rockabilly, progressive rock, heavy metal, gospel and disco. As he explained in a 1986 interview, [...] "I hate doing the same thing <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again.</b> I like to see what's happening now in music, film and theatre and incorporate all of those things." [...] Compared to many popular songwriters, Mercury also tended to write musically complex material. For example, [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] is acyclic in structure and comprises dozens of chords. He also wrote six songs from Queen II which deal with multiple key changes and complex material. [...] "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", on the other hand, contains only a few chords. Despite the fact that Mercury often wrote very intricate harmonies, he also claimed that he could barely read music. He wrote most of his songs on the piano and used a wide variety of different key signatures.|$|E
500|$|... "Gorilla" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by most music critics. Some of them praised its musical structure, while others complained for its lack for lyrical depth. In {{a review of}} Unorthodox Jukebox, Slant Magazines Andrew Chan wrote {{that it is the}} album's highlight being the most energetic track on the album and found it [...] "most infectious bedroom anthem of the year." [...] Likewise, Lauren Kreisler from the Official Charts Company, described the song as an apparent bedroom antics. About.com critic Bill Lamb rated the song 3 out of 5 stars, praising the musicality, since the singer recaptures [...] "the musical spirit of Prince's arena sized ballad [...] "Purple Rain" [...] and [...] "the pounding keyboards and crunchy guitar will invite a live audience to sway along in time to the music". On the other hand, the [...] "erotic connection" [...] is misguided because [...] "the words about alcohol and cocaine fueled rough sex, {{it is difficult to see}} the song as truly erotic", making the lyrics [...] "tasteless" [...] and lacking concept. Official Charts Company's Lauren Kreisler found that the lyrics' concept simply [...] "baffled" [...] anyone, while ultimately described the song as [...] "intriguing (and anthemic) enough to make us listen <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> to work it out." ...|$|E
500|$|With polls {{released}} on October 6 showing Roosevelt well ahead, Willkie began to sound an isolationist theme, accusing Roosevelt {{of being a}} warmonger. Many of Willkie's speeches to that point had been on domestic issues, {{but he had been}} advised by Martin, Hamilton, and other advisors that the war was the issue the voters really cared about. Willkie began to argue that Roosevelt would not keep the U.S. out of war, but that he would. He was given room to make this argument by the United Kingdom's increasing success in the Battle of Britain, as it was clear a German invasion was not imminent. The polls showed voters responding positively to this new tack, and Willkie kept on this course {{for the remainder of the}} campaign. Roosevelt reacted by scheduling five speeches for the final days, in which he proposed to rebut Willkie's [...] "falsifications". The president stated, [...] "I have said <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>and</b> <b>again</b> that your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars." [...] Willkie was prone to ad lib remarks, which sometimes led to gaffes: addressing steelworkers, he pledged to appoint a new Secretary of Labor, [...] "and it will not be a woman either". This allusion to Secretary Frances Perkins, the only woman to hold a cabinet position in American history to that point, did not aid him among female voters.|$|E

2500|$|During the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, {{numerous}} {{women were}} tortured and raped. Exact numbers {{are not known}} and are a subject of debate. Most {{of the women were}} captured from Dhaka University and private homes and kept as sex-slaves inside the Dhaka Cantonment. Australian Doctor Geoffrey Davis was brought to Bangladesh by the United Nation and International Planned Parenthood Federation to carry out late term abortions on rape victims. He was of the opinion that the 200,000 to 400,000 rape victims was an underestimation. On the actions of Pakistan army he said [...] "They’d keep the infantry back and put artillery ahead and they would shell the hospitals and schools. And that caused absolute chaos in the town. And then the infantry would go in and begin to segregate the women. Apart from little children, all those were sexually matured would be segregated...And then the women would be put in the compound under guard and made available to the troops…Some of the stories they told were appalling.
