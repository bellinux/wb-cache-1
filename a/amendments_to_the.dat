5|$|Adams was {{concerned}} about the new Constitution and made an attempt to re-enter national politics.

Despite his defeat, Adams continued to work for <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Constitution, a movement that ultimately resulted in the addition of a Bill of Rights in 1791. Adams subsequently became a firm supporter of the Constitution, with these amendments and the possibility of more.|$|E

5|$|After independence, the Parliament of Singapore {{remained}} fully elected until 1984, when <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act {{were passed}} {{to provide for}} Non-constituency Members of Parliament ("NCMPs"). NCMPs, who are declared elected by the returning officer, consist of the best performing losers in general elections based on the percentage of votes cast. The scheme ensures that opposition representation is accounted for in the Parliament. In 1990, yet another type of unelected Member was introduced – the Nominated Member of Parliament ("NMP"). These non-partisan Members were brought in to provide alternate views on policies that differed from the opinions espoused by the political parties represented in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Amending the UN Charter, {{possibly}} {{through a}} Charter Review Conference under Article 109 of the UN Charter, is a commonly cited possibility.

There have been only five <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> UN Charter since 1945, and none of them were done through the Article 109 process. Louis Sohn and Grenville Clark, in their 1958 book World Peace Through World Law, proposed establishing a UN Parliamentary Assembly through this method.|$|E
