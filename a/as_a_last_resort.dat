5|$|The console {{can monitor}} its {{internal}} temperature and adjust accordingly to prevent overheating; alongside increasing fan speed, additional measures can be taken, including forcing the hardware {{to run in}} a lower power state—a feature that was not present on Xbox 360. Restricting power consumption lowers maximum performance, but the setting would be intended <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>resort</b> to prevent permanent hardware damage.|$|E
5|$|A cricothyrotomy is an {{incision}} {{made through}} the skin and cricothyroid membrane to establish a patent airway during certain life-threatening situations, such as airway obstruction by a foreign body, angioedema, or massive facial trauma. A cricothyrotomy is nearly always performed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>resort</b> in cases where orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation are impossible or contraindicated. Cricothyrotomy is easier and quicker to perform than tracheotomy, does not require manipulation of the cervical spine and is associated with fewer complications.|$|E

She tells Eric {{that the entire}} property will be meticulously searched for the skull <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>resort.</b> Mickey secretly steals the skull and brings it to Snow before Eric can retrieve it. That night, Eric prepares to murder Jenni and stage it as a suicide. Jenni sees Marion's ghost in Mickey's greenhouse and flees back to the house, where Eric begins throttling her. The ghost appears and chases Eric outside, corners and attacks him, drowning him in the decorative pond.|$|E

5|$|Cells cannot {{function}} if DNA damage corrupts {{the integrity}} and accessibility of essential information in the genome (but cells remain superficially functional when non-essential genes are missing or damaged). Depending {{on the type of}} damage inflicted on the DNA's double helical structure, a variety of repair strategies have evolved to restore lost information. If possible, cells use the unmodified complementary strand of the DNA or the sister chromatid as a template to recover the original information. Without access to a template, cells use an error-prone recovery mechanism known as translesion synthesis <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>resort.</b>|$|E

Marge finds out about the loan after she sees the IOU note, and her sisters tell her what happened.|$|E
5|$|Polar {{bears are}} the iconic symbol of Svalbard, {{and one of}} the main tourist attractions. The animals are {{protected}} and people moving outside the settlements are required to have appropriate scare devices to ward off attacks. They are also advised to also carry a firearm for use <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>resort.</b> A British schoolboy was killed by a polar bear in 2011.

5|$|The {{position}} that the general strike could be used, but only <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>resort,</b> became dominant in the party during the mass strike debate. This caused much concern among the conservatives in the party, especially among many trade unionists. At a meeting in February 1906, the trade unionists were placated by party leaders, who said they would attempt to prevent a general strike at all costs. The FVdG reacted by publishing the secret protocols from the meeting in Die Einigkeit, greatly angering the party leadership.|$|E
5|$|The story starts {{eight months}} after the murder of Tracy Bond, which {{occurred}} {{at the end of the}} previous novel, On Her Majesty's Secret Service. James Bond is drinking and gambling heavily and making mistakes on his assignments when, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>resort,</b> he is sent to Japan on a semi-diplomatic mission. Whilst there he is challenged by the Head of the Japanese Secret Service to kill Dr. Guntram Shatterhand. Bond realises that Shatterhand is Ernst Stavro Blofeld and sets out on a revenge mission to kill him and his wife, Irma Bunt.|$|E
5|$|When the {{legislative}} session ended on March 28, Breckinridge returned to Kentucky and addressed {{the state legislature}} on April 2, 1861. He urged the General Assembly to push for federal adoption of the Crittenden Compromise and advocated calling a border states convention, which would draft a compromise proposal and submit it to the Northern and Southern states for adoption. Asserting that the states were coequal and free {{to choose their own}} course, he maintained that, if the border states convention failed, Kentucky should call a sovereignty convention and join the Confederacy <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>resort.</b>|$|E
40|$|The current wave of {{globalization}} has profound labour market effects, accentuated, in many cases, {{by the current}} financial and economic crisis. This paper reviews general labour market trends and country examples, arguing that the current globalization process makes labour’s position more precarious, a trend magnified by the current crisis. This {{is consistent with the}} policy reactions to the crisis: governments have (rightly) acted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> banker of <b>last</b> <b>resort</b> to avoid the collapse of the financial system, but, despite stimulus plans and monetary easing and some labour market policies, have not really acted <b>as</b> <b>an</b> employer of <b>last</b> <b>resort...</b>|$|R

5|$|Historically, two {{breakers}} {{known as}} the Eddy Creek Shaft and the No. 2 Shaft were situated {{on the banks of}} Eddy Creek. In the late 1800s, a mine fire started in the No. 2 Shaft. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>resort,</b> water from Eddy Creek and the Lackawanna River were used in an attempt to extinguish it. Historically, there was a dam on the creek. The dam was owned by the Delaware and Hudson Company and was used for impounding water to flush ashes from a power plant. The creek also supplied water for a washery at the Underwood Colliery.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 14 September, Hitler and his command held a conference at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin to discuss the future direction of the war. Göring was not present; he was inspecting Luftwaffe units in Belgium. Erhard Milch replaced him. Hitler praised the attacks which had caused heavy damage to the RAF and London. He blamed the failure to achieve more decisive results on the weather. Nevertheless, {{it was clear to}} Hitler that victory had still not been attained by the Luftwaffe. Under those circumstances, Operation Sea Lion could not take place. Großadmiral Erich Raeder, commander-in-chief of the Kriegsmarine, agreed. He argued that Sea Lion should only be carried out <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>resort</b> regardless of gaining air superiority.|$|E
5|$|Taylor apprised President McKinley of the {{situation}} in Kentucky. He stopped short of asking for intervention by federal troops, and McKinley assured a delegation of Kentucky's federal legislators that such intervention would occur only <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>resort.</b> Republican legislators made preparations to heed Taylor's call to convene in London on February 5. Meanwhile, in order to resolve any doubts about the legitimacy of their earlier meeting, Democratic legislators met at the state house—no longer being denied entrance by the state militia—and again voted to adopt the majority report declaring Goebel and Beckham the winners of the election. Both men again took the oath of office.|$|E

50|$|Although {{still in}} the {{experimental}} stages, blasting with dynamite is one form of vibrational control that will break loose any frazil ice accumulation. The charge must be precise such that the ice breaks, but surrounding structures and environment are not harmed. Safety of the blasting also is important and nearby residents might complain about sound pollution. For all these reasons, this method is not often used, except <b>as</b> <b>an</b> emergency <b>last</b> <b>resort.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{winner and}} runner-up of each pool enter the {{knockout}} stage. The knockout stage consists of quarter- and semi-finals, {{and then the}} final. The winner of each pool is placed against a runner-up of a different pool in a quarter-final. The winner of each quarter-final goes on to the semi-finals, and the respective winners proceed to the final. Losers of the semi-finals contest for third place, called the 'Bronze Final'. If a match in the knockout stages ends in a draw, the winner is determined through extra time. If that fails, the match goes into sudden death and the next team to score any points is the winner. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>resort,</b> a kicking competition is used.|$|E
5|$|As in all Norwegian {{national}} parks, motorized {{land transport}} is banned. However, on Svalbard {{this does not}} include snowmobiles. On the other hand, cycling is banned. The Governor can, however, enforce temporary bans on snowmobiles or even all travel within the national park. Use of helicopters and aircraft for sight-seeing are also prohibited. Polar bears are protected, but anyone outside of settlements is required to carry a rifle to kill polar bears in self-defense, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>resort,</b> should they attack. Most flora and fauna are protected; the right to gather established with the freedom to roam does not apply in national parks, although there are some exceptions. Hunting is permitted after explicit permit from the Governor, and locals have more access to hunting rights than tourists. Fishing is not permitted, although dispensations can be given.|$|E
5|$|Captive {{populations of}} both ruffed lemur species exist in American and European zoos, {{representing}} a safeguard against extinction. In the United States, captive breeding is {{managed by the}} Species Survival Plan (SSP), a program developed by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). Although the populations are very limited in their genetic diversity, these species thrive in captivity, making them an ideal candidate for reintroduction into protected habitat, if it is available. Although reintroduction is seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>resort</b> among conservationists, a combination of in situ conservation efforts, such as legal protection, public education, the spread of sustainable livelihoods, and reforestation offer hope for ruffed lemurs. In the meantime, reintroductions offer conservation research opportunities and allow the limited genetic diversity maintained by the SSP to improve the genetic diversity of dwindling Malagasy ruffed lemur populations.|$|E
