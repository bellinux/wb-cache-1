There was no significant difference of perceptions of productivity in society between the physical disability and the mental disability (M= 5. 60, SD= 2. 04), p=. 369.

These mentioned families should manage the crisis, but successful managing of this situation can be very strengthening element. The {{families with}} <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child manifest in different way than the families with healthy children, because the birth of child with <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> intervenes {{the peace of the}} whole family. This fact can remark the family even this way, which the physical problems can appear by the parents or they can incline to risk change of their behaviour. The parents? roles also could change and exists also risk, that brothers and sister of child with <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> can follow contacts with difficulties. These families have their own particularity, because the birth of child with <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> means great stress for these families. The theoretic part of this work pays attention to <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> and its classification. Further are the welfare services available, which can families with <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child use of. It is not also left out the role of family, the importance of parental roles and brotherly and sisterly constellation. I describe style of upbringing and further I concern the particularity of family with <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child in my dissertation likewise the role of brother and sister by the child with <b>a</b> mental <b>disability.</b> There are also stages of acceptance with the diagnosis of <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> and risk behaviour of parents these children with <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> as results of managing critical situation described and the related physical problems. The target of dissertation is finding out if exists diametrically differences between parental roles by the care about <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child and the healthy child. The intermediate target is finding out if the families with <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child are more predisposed to a presence of social pathological syndromes. The theory expects following fact that the care for <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child has provided by overall in majority by mothers. Families with <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child incline to risk change of their behaviour than by the families with the healthy child. Brothers and sisters of <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child do less friendly relationships than of the healthy children. The approach to quantitative study was used at all. The strategy of questionnaire: The questionnaire inquiry was performed by the 20 families with healthy children and by the 20 families with <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child. The filled questionnaires had evaluated using the elementary statistics of software programmes SPSS and Excel. I found out more conflicting relationships between brothers and sisters in the families with <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child than in the families with healthy children. Brothers and sisters of <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child care more about their mental disability brother or sister than the elder brothers and sisters care about their younger ones. Likewise the brothers and sisters with <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> brother or sister have less friendly relationships than the children with healthy brothers and sisters. Families with healthy children enjoy more harmonious parental care than by the families with <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child and mainly mothers do it. The grandparents act on behalf of parents with healthy children more often than in the families with <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child, there exists often absence caring grandparents. The same is the fact that both compared families models using mostly democratic style of upbringing. Psychical problems exist more often by the parents with <b>a</b> mental <b>disability</b> child...|$|R

Results: Interviews revealed that almost all the taxi drivers had encountered passengers with <b>a</b> communication <b>disability,</b> and had <b>an</b> awareness of passengers with <b>a</b> hearing <b>disability</b> as opposed to <b>a</b> speech <b>disability.</b> Furthermore mini-bus taxi drivers generally held a positive view of their passengers with <b>a</b> communication <b>disability.</b> Conclusion: Study findings contribute to existing literature within the fields of speech pathology and audiology, advocacy groups and policy makers, particularly research studies on participation experiences of persons with communication disabilities related to transportation access. The results of the study should also provide <b>a</b> foundation for <b>disability</b> policy development initiatives with the aim of increasing levels of public awareness.
