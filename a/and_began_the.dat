5|$|About 154 BC, a major revolt was re-ignited in Numantia, {{which is}} known as the First Numantine War, and a long war of {{resistance}} was fought between the advancing forces of the Roman Republic and the Lusitani tribes of Hispania. The praetor Servius Sulpicius Galba and the proconsul Lucius Licinius Lucullus arrived in 151 BC <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>the</b> process of subduing the local population. In 150 BC, Galba betrayed the Lusitani leaders he had invited to peace talks and had them killed, ingloriously ending {{the first phase of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|According to the 1st and 2nd century {{geographer}} Ptolemy, Deva was in {{the lands}} of the Cornovii. Their land bordered that of the Brigantes {{in the north and}} the Ordovices in the west and included parts of what is now Cheshire, Shropshire, and north Wales. When the Romans' treaty with the Brigantes– who occupied most of what is now Northern England– failed the Romans embarked on military conquest of the area. The campaigns were initially led by Sextus Julius Frontinus and later Gnaeus Julius Agricola. Their expansion into the north of Britannia during the reign of Vespasian meant that the Romans needed a new military base. Chester was a strategic site for a fortress, commanding access to the sea via the River Dee and dividing the Brigantes from the Ordovices. Legio II Adiutrix was sent to Chester <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>the</b> construction of a legionary fortress in the mid AD70s.|$|E
5|$|After initial preparations, the Americans and French {{built their}} first {{parallel}} <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>the</b> bombardment. With the British defense weakened, on October 14, 1781 Washington sent two columns {{to attack the}} last major remaining British outer defenses. A French column took Redoubt No. 9 and an American column took Redoubt No. 10. With these defenses taken, the allies were able to finish their second parallel. With the American artillery closer and its bombardment more intense than ever, the British position began to deteriorate rapidly and Cornwallis asked for capitulation terms on October 17. After two days of negotiation, the surrender ceremony occurred on October 19; Lord Cornwallis was absent from the ceremony. With the capture of more than 7,000 British soldiers, negotiations between the United States and Great Britain began, resulting in the Treaty of Paris of 1783.|$|E
5|$|After the war, all AIF units {{went into}} camp <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>the</b> process of demobilisation. The AIF's {{involvement}} in the occupation of former German or Turkish territory was limited as Prime Minister William Hughes requested their early repatriation. The exceptions were No. 4 Squadron, AFC and the 3rd Australian Casualty Clearing Station, which participated in the occupation of the Rhineland. The 7th Light Horse Regiment was also sent to occupy the Gallipoli peninsula for six weeks, along with a New Zealand regiment. At {{the time of the}} armistice, there were 95,951 soldiers in France and a further 58,365 in England, 17,255 in the Middle East plus nurses in Salonika and India, all to be transported home. Around 120 Australians decided to delay their departure and instead joined the British Army, serving in Northern Russia during the Russian Civil War, although officially the Australian government refused to contribute forces to the campaign.|$|E

Favored to win a second consecutive SEC championship and be in contention for the national championship, the Crimson Tide opened the season with five consecutive victories over San Jose State, Penn State, Duke, Arkansas and Florida. However, Alabama completed the regular season with only nine victories and losses to South Carolina, LSU and Auburn and finished fourth in the Western Division. After the regular season, the Crimson Tide accepted an invitation {{to compete in the}} Capital One Bowl in Orlando. Against Big Ten co-champions Michigan State, Alabama won by a final score of 49–7 and captured both a third straight ten win season and top ten finish.|$|E

In 2003, the clinical group practice of the PHPDA officially split off to form a 501(c)3 health care organization, PacMed Clinics(doing business as Pacific Medical Centers or PMC). The Pacific Medical Center Clinic continues {{to operate in the}} first two floors of the building. In 2010, Amazon.com ended its sub-lease with WRC.Com Tower LLC <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>the</b> move of its headquarters to a new campus in the city's South Lake Union neighborhood. Much of the building was left vacant without new tenants moving into the space. The location outside of downtown Seattle was a constraint for businesses.|$|E

This {{reflects}} the song's intended performance by an entire minstrel troupe. The lead minstrel played Tucker <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>the</b> song, but backup singers took over at times to allow Tucker to act out the scenario, dance, and do another comedy bit. There was probably an element of competition to the various dance and music solos. The third-person verses also allowed for commentary to suggest to the audience how they were to judge the character and his antics.|$|E
5|$|Derek McInnes was {{announced}} as {{the successor to}} Craig Brown in March 2013. In McInnes' first season as manager, Aberdeen won the 2013–14 Scottish League Cup after defeating Inverness 4–2 on penalties, their first trophy in 19 years. Aberdeen {{finished third in the}} Scottish Premiership, <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>the</b> next season by coming through the early rounds of the Europa League, beating Dutch club FC Groningen before eventually being eliminated by Spanish side Real Sociedad. The club ended the season in second place in both 2015 and 2016, their best league position since 1993–94. In recent seasons' Europa League competitions, they were defeated in the third qualifying round three times: In 2015–16 by FC Kairat, in 2016–17 by NK Maribor, and in 2017–18 by Apollon Limassol.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne {{hoped to}} build on the success of the 2008–09 season <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>the</b> new year with five {{straight}} victories. Soon, however, a string of setbacks hit the team, including the loss of two players, one due to injury and the other to suspension. Duquesne lost its final non-conference game and slipped into a five-game losing streak. The team did manage to break the streak, but had trouble gaining any momentum. In mid-February the Dukes finally seemed to break free with a solid 21point victory over La Salle, followed by a crucial road upset of the University of Charlotte, which was ranked first in the Atlantic 10 Conference at the time, and finally another upset of the University of Dayton Flyers in front of a sellout Pittsburgh crowd. However, Duquesne then lost its final two road games of the season.|$|E

Gloucestershire were soundly beaten by 244 runs, a big margin at the time. Yorkshire scored 158 and 360; Gloucestershire scored 201 to claim a good first innings lead but were then bowled out for 73 and crashed to a heavy defeat. Grace batted quite well, scoring 62 and 35. With the ball, he took 2–48 and 4–128. They were undone by the bowling of Billy Bates who took 11 wickets in the match, {{including}} 7–38 in the second innings; while George Ulyett and Ephraim Lockwood both scored centuries in Yorkshire's second innings. The match was played {{for the benefit of}} Tom Emmett, who received £616 13s 1d.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, paleontologists David M. Raup and Jack Sepkoski {{suggested}} that extinction events on Earth followed a periodic trend.

Muller was already involved in the automated supernova searches underway at Leuschner, <b>and</b> <b>began</b> <b>the</b> search for Nemesis using the optical telescopes at Leuschner Observatory.|$|E
