5|$|A {{number of}} {{questions}} are raised within the philosophy of suicide, included what constitutes suicide, whether or not suicide can be a rational choice, and the moral permissibility of suicide. Arguments as to <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> suicide in moral or social terms range from {{the position that the}} act is inherently immoral and unacceptable under any circumstances to a regard for suicide as a sacrosanct right of anyone who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives, even if they are young and healthy.|$|E
5|$|Hadley has {{conducted}} research on animal rights extremism, {{concluding that the}} phenomenon is a complex one, and that {{a full understanding of}} individual extremists' intentions and targets are necessary to understand the ethical <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> extremist acts and whether such acts are appropriately classified as terrorism. He holds that while direct action should be tolerated in liberal democracies, this toleration should not extend to certain campaigning tactics used by extremists, such as threat-making.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{approach}} to the yield evaluation of electronic circuits is presented. It is a divide-and-conquer algorithm based on interval arithmetic that allows one to reliably mark as feasible or unfeasible those hyper-rectangles that are completely in or out of the region <b>of</b> <b>acceptability.</b> In addition, it identifies any portion of the boundaries of the region <b>of</b> <b>acceptability</b> that is included in the tolerance region and refines the analysis across it. The proposed technique guarantees an efficient, reliable and accurate evaluation of the yield, even in presence of a non-convex and non-simply connected region <b>of</b> <b>acceptability.</b> Thanks to its capacity to quickly detect the boundary of the region <b>of</b> <b>acceptability,</b> it is proposed as a useful tool for tolerance design. The example presented shows the features of the approach...|$|R

5|$|The {{image of}} the masque within the play deals with hiding one's identity. Fielding, like many other playwrights, focuses on how the masque genre deals with the social <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> {{altering}} identities within the format. However, Fielding extends the image to discuss society and those who impersonate social and gender roles {{that they do not}} fill. Fielding also has a problem with those who act viciously with license even though he is willing to accept some of the lesser libertine actions. Merital, for instance, is a sexual type of libertine and is treated differently than those like Sir Positive Trap, Lord Formal, and Sir Apish Simple who are criticised as being part of the corrupted order. Trap and Formal are part of old families, and their attachment to the age of their families and their attempts to use that to justify their beliefs over what is proper is ridiculed within the play. In particular, Merital is the one able to point out their flaws.|$|E
5|$|This pricing {{mechanism}} {{has been}} used in several public utilities and public services for setting higher prices during congested periods, as a means to better manage the demand for the service, and whether to avoid expensive new investments just to satisfy peak demand, or because it is not economically or financially feasible to provide additional capacity to the service. Congestion pricing has been widely used by telephone and electric utilities, metros, railways and autobus services, and has been proposed for charging internet access. It also has been extensively studied and advocated by mainstream transport economists for ports, waterways, airports and road pricing, though actual implementation is rather limited due to the controversial issues subject to debate regarding this policy, particularly for urban roads, such as undesirable distribution effects, the disposition of the revenues raised, and the social and political <b>acceptability</b> <b>of</b> the congestion charge.|$|E

The authors recruited 375 people from a possible 1, 200 who completed a randomized, population-based telephone survey administered in 2001 to individuals living in Sumter Co 3 unty, South Carolina. Mailed kits included pedometer, instructions, a recording calendar, and a postage-paid return envelope. Participants wore the pedometer during waking hours and recorded day-end steps taken for seven days. Up to three telephone prompts were made to get participants to return data. Despite the limitations of initial recruitment, this study provides preliminary information on the <b>acceptability</b> and feasibility <b>of</b> a pedometer-assessed physical activity self-monitoring survey...|$|R
50|$|The theorem {{is valid}} for all regions <b>of</b> <b>acceptability</b> and all Gaussian distributions. It {{may be used}} by cyclic {{repetition}} of random variation and selection (like the natural evolution). In every cycle a sufficiently large number of Gaussian distributed points are sampled and tested {{for membership in the}} region <b>of</b> <b>acceptability.</b> The centre <b>of</b> gravity of the Gaussian, m, is then moved to the centre of gravity of the approved (selected) points, m*. Thus, the process converges to a state of equilibrium fulfilling the theorem. A solution is always approximate because the centre of gravity is always determined for a limited number of points.|$|R

25|$|Within {{the past}} twenty years however, there has been a major shift in linguists' {{understanding}} of intermediate levels <b>of</b> <b>acceptability.</b> This is due to the increasing use of experimental methods to measure acceptability, making it possible to detect subtle differences along a scale <b>of</b> <b>acceptability.</b> Keller (2000) and Fanselow et al.

30|$|The idea <b>of</b> <b>acceptability</b> {{has been}} {{modified}} or generalized in certain directions. For example, Giuliano Antonini et al.

50|$|Phenotypes {{are often}} Gaussian {{distributed}} {{in a large}} population and {{a necessary condition for}} the natural evolution to be able to fulfill the theorem of Gaussian adaptation, with respect to all Gaussian quantitative characters, is that it may push the centre of gravity of the Gaussian to the centre of gravity of the selected individuals. This may be accomplished by the Hardy-Weinberg law. This is possible because the theorem of Gaussian adaptation is valid for any region <b>of</b> <b>acceptability</b> independent <b>of</b> the structure (Kjellström, 1996).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{centered}} on the family of Dung’s finite argumentation frameworks when the attacks relation is symmetric (and nonempty and irreflexive). We show that while this family does not contain any well-founded framework, every element of it is both coherent and relatively grounded. Then {{we focus on the}} acceptability problems for the various semantics introduced by Dung, yet generalized to sets of arguments. We show that only two distinct forms <b>of</b> <b>acceptability</b> are possible when the considered frameworks are symmetric. Those forms <b>of</b> <b>acceptability</b> are quite simple, but tractable; this contrasts with the general case for which all the forms <b>of</b> <b>acceptability</b> are intractable (except for the ones based on grounded or naive extensions). ...|$|R
