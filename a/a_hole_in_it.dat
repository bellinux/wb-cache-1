25|$|A finite {{cylinder}} may {{be constructed}} as a manifold by {{starting with a}} strip nbsp&×nbsp& and gluing a pair of opposite edges on the boundary by a suitable diffeomorphism. A projective plane may be obtained by gluing a sphere with <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> to a Möbius strip along their respective circular boundaries.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrangements}} {{inside the}} outhouse vary by culture. In Western societies, many, though not all, {{have at least}} one seat with <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> above a small pit. Others, often in more rural, older areas in European countries, simply have a hole with two indents on either side for your feet. In Eastern societies, there is a hole in the floor, over which the user crouches. A roll of toilet paper is usually available. Old corn cobs, leaves, or other types of paper are also used.|$|E

25|$|Chandrasekhar had minimal batting skills, {{finishing}} with a Test average of 4.07. He {{was given a}} special Gray-Nicholls bat during the 1977–78 Australian tour with <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> to commemorate the four ducks he scored, and he has 23 Test ducks to his credit. He also holds the dubious distinction of scoring fewer runs (167) off his bat than wickets (242) taken in Test cricket; the only other cricketer with this distinction over a significant Test career is New Zealand fast bowler Chris Martin.|$|E
25|$|The {{fifth wheel}} {{coupling}} provides a pivoting link between a semi-trailer and the towing truck, tractor unit, leading trailer or dolly. Some recreational vehicles have a fifth wheel configuration, requiring the coupling to be installed {{in the bed of}} a pickup truck as a towing vehicle. The coupling consists of a coupling pin (or kingpin) {{on the front of the}} semi-trailer, and a horseshoe-shaped coupling device called a fifth wheel on the rear of the towing vehicle. In 1911, Charles Martin invented the fifth wheel coupler consisting of a round plate with <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> attached to a frame mounted on his tractor.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{the front}} {{head of a}} kit bass drum has <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> to allow air to escape when the drum is struck for shorter sustain. Muffling can be {{installed}} through the hole without taking off the front head. The hole also allows microphones to be placed into the bass drum for recording and amplification. In addition to microphones, sometimes trigger pads are used to amplify the sound and provide a uniform tone, especially when fast playing without decrease of volume is desired. Professional drummers often choose to have a customized bass drum front head, with the logo or name of their band on the front.|$|E

25|$|The party then learns of {{one last}} hope of {{stopping}} Melodia and Malpercio: the Magnus of Life. This power is {{counter to the}} End Magnus which currently empower Malpercio, and that this power was used to create Kalas and his brother, Fee. Kalas, however, was too human for Geldoblame's liking and only had one wing, so Geldoblame had ordered his termination. This leads Georg to blow up his laboratory with explosives and secretly flee to Mira with Kalas and Fee in tow. Due to being a creation of the Magnus of Life, however, Kalas is empowered by it, though he does not yet know how to tap into this power. The group decide to tie up some loose ends from their journey so they can learn to harness the Magnus of Life's tremendous power. While they are doing this, it is decided that the islands shall launch a massive assault against Cor Hydrae's barrier. The purpose is to create <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> so Kalas' party can enter by flying the White Dragon into it.|$|E
500|$|... is {{a measure}} of how much energy it takes to expose a bilayer edge to water by tearing the bilayer or {{creating}} <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> The origin of this energy is the fact that creating such an interface exposes some of the lipid tails to water, but the exact orientation of these border lipids is unknown. There is some evidence that both hydrophobic (tails straight) and hydrophilic (heads curved around) pores can coexist.|$|E
500|$|Z Canis Majoris is a {{star system}} a mere 300,000 years old {{composed}} of two pre-main-sequence stars—a FU Orionis star and a Herbig Ae/Be star, which has brightened episodically by two magnitudes to magnitude 8 in 1987, 2000, 2004 and 2008. The more massive Herbig Ae/Be star is enveloped in an irregular roughly spherical cocoon of dust that has an inner diameter of [...] and outer diameter of [...] The cocoon has <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> through which light shines that covers an angle of 5 to 10 degrees of its circumference. Both stars are surrounded by a large envelope of in-falling material {{left over from the}} original cloud that formed the system. Both stars are emitting jets of material, that of the Herbig Ae/Be star being much larger—11.7 light-years long. Meanwhile, FS Canis Majoris is another star with infra-red emissions indicating a compact shell of dust, but {{it appears to be a}} main-sequence star that has absorbed material from a companion. These stars are thought to be significant contributors to interstellar dust.|$|E

500|$|In 1983 Reagan's Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt {{cancelled}} The Beach Boys annual Independence Day {{performance in}} Washington, D.C, opting instead for crooner Wayne Newton and a U.S. Army band. The Beach Boys {{had played a}} free concert on the National Mall every July 4 since 1980 until Watt declared that rock music attracted [...] "the wrong element" [...] and that the administration was [...] "not going to encourage drug abuse and alcoholism as was done in past years." [...] Watt's social conservativism made him the target of public outcry and denouncements from both the President and the First Lady who declared themselves Beach Boys fans. Days after Watt's announcement, Reagan presented the Secretary with a plaster boot with <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> to indicate that Watt had [...] "shot himself in the foot." [...] Watt soon reversed his order and invited the Beach Boys back, but the band had quickly booked another 4 July concert in Atlantic City. The Beach Boys returned to a crowd of 750,000 on the National Mall in 1984 and performed at Reagan's second inaugural ball the following year.|$|E
500|$|Jake Coyle of the Associated Press {{was more}} {{critical}} of the film, calling it [...] "terribly overstuffed {{and many of the}} jokes get drowned out by the special effects... The pervasive movie references detract from the stab at freshness, and Guardians depends all too much on the whimsy of '70s anthems for an original beat." [...] He also felt that Close, Reilly and del Toro were underused in the film. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, [...] "In place of wit, Guardians offers a sort of generalized willingness to be amusing, an atmosphere of high spirits that feels like lots of people pumping air into a tire that has <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> Everyone is clearly working, but nothing is really happening–and yet the effort is so evident that there's an impulse to reward it." [...] Kyle Smith of the New York Post also had a negative response to the film, comparing it to Howard the Duck and Green Lantern, and criticizing the dialogue, villains, soundtrack, lack of suspense, and the characters of Quill, Rocket, and Drax. The film received mixed reviews in China, where viewers complained that the film's [...] "poor subtitle translation not only spoiled the fun of watching it, but also made it difficult to understand its humor." ...|$|E
500|$|Worcester was {{occupied}} by Sir John Byron on 16 September 1647, who {{was on his way}} to deliver wagons of silver plate from Oxford to the Charles I at Shrewsbury. Byron realising that he could not hold Worcester with a Parliamentary army under the command of Earl of Essex already approaching city, he had sent a request to the King for additional forces to aid him. The Parliamentarians were aware of Byron's mission and an advanced force under the command of Colonel Nathaniel Fiennes arrived at the Sidbury Gate early on 22 September. What followed was typical of the inexperienced soldiery on both sides. The Parliamentarians were not challenged as they approached the gate and had they but known it they could have pushed it open and been into the town without difficultly. However they struck the gates with an axe which made <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> and then fired a musket through the hole. This aroused the lax Royalist guard who called out the Royalist garrison. The Parliamentarian assault team quickly withdrew. They then loosely [...] invested the north of the city. In doing so they hoped to prevent Byron and his convoy leaving the city, which could be taken by Essex's main force in a day or so.|$|E

500|$|Behind Yuhuatai the 88th Division had {{stationed}} its barely trained {{new recruits}} atop Nanking's Zhonghua Gate. The Japanese had already tried {{the previous night}} to infiltrate a [...] "suicide squadron" [...] bearing explosive picric acid up to this gate to blow <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> but it {{got lost in the}} morning fog and failed to reach the wall. At noon on December 12 a team of just six Japanese soldiers made it across the moat in a small boat and succeeded in scaling the wall at Zhonghua Gate on a shaky bamboo ladder and raising the Japanese flag there. Five of them were killed by gunfire but the last man grabbed a Chinese machine gun and held the position singlehandedly. Soon after another Japanese team set a fire in front of the gate to create a smokescreen. By 5:00 pm more and more Japanese troops were crossing the moat and swarming Zhonghua Gate by fording makeshift bridges so rickety their engineers had to hold them aloft with their own bodies, {{and with the help of}} some well aimed Japanese artillery fire from atop Yuhuatai parts of the wall finally crumbled. Meanwhile, just west of Zhonghua Gate, other soldiers also of Japan's 10th Army had punched a hole through Chinese lines in the wetlands south of Shuixi Gate and were launching a violent drive on that gate with the support of a fleet of tanks.|$|E
2500|$|The remedy, {{invented by}} Beatrice [...] "Tilly" [...] Shilling, was {{to fit a}} metal {{diaphragm}} with <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> across the float chambers.

2500|$|The {{purpose of}} a {{stamping}} mill is to crush the mined ore to a fine sand which is then processed at an adjacent [...] "dressing floor" [...] to separate the heavier tin ore from the waste material or [...] "gangue", which is dumped. There are remains of six stamping mills at Eylesbarrow mine, an unusually high number, although they were not all in use at the same time. They form a rough line down the hillside into {{the head of the}} Drizzlecombe valley and in the literature they are numbered from 1 to 6: No.1 is the highest, located just below the first pumping waterwheel {{to the north of the}} main track; No.6 is about [...] distant and some [...] lower down the slope. The prominent wall with <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> just below the main track is the side wall of the wheelpit of stamping mill No.2, the hole marking the location of the axle.|$|E
2500|$|On April 15, Washington was, as {{journalist}} George A. Townsend said, [...] "full of Detective Police". At Stanton's request, the United States Secret Service and the New York Police Department {{joined the}} War Department's detectives' tireless search for Booth and any accomplices. Stanton had the lower {{deck of the}} monitor USS Montauk, which was placed near the Washington Navy Yard, host several of the conspirators, Lewis Powell, Michael O'Laughlen, Edmund Spangler, and George Atzerodt. The other plotters, except Booth and Mary Surratt, were confined aboard the USS Saugus. The prisoners on both boats were bound by ball and chain, with handcuffs attached to an iron rod. Stanton also ordered a bag placed over the captives' heads, with <b>a</b> <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> to allow for eating and breathing. Surratt was kept at Old Capitol Prison, {{where she had been}} since her arrest. Booth, the remaining culprit, had been shot at a barn in Virginia, and died soon after. Booth's cadaver was put aboard the Montauk. After an autopsy was performed, and Booth's identity confirmed beyond any doubt, he was buried in a [...] "secret, unmarked, and unhallowed grave", on Stanton's orders. Stanton knew Booth would be lionized in the South, and thought he would not give anyone the opportunity. The conspirators went on to be tried and convicted. All but three were hanged.|$|E
