25|$|Yellow-poplar weevils {{are small}} black-snout beetles and are tick-like in appearance. While in its larval stage, the weevil {{presents}} {{as a white}} legless grub. Measuring approximately 1/16 of <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>long,</b> the adult weevils are normally black or dark brown in coloring. While most weevils are a solid color it has been noted that some southern populations exhibit yellow antenna. Its protruding snout can lead them sometimes {{to be confused with}} a tick.|$|E
25|$|V. {{squamosa}} {{is typically}} about half <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>long</b> and distinguishable by its black body and yellow striping pattern over its entire body. This species has clear wings and a hairless body. While the males and workers resemble other yellowjackets, the queen {{has a unique}} appearance. She is significantly larger than the males and workers and is more orange in color. In addition, both V. squamosa and the V. sulphurea have two stripes on their scuta, which differentiates them from other species.|$|E
25|$|Of furniture, folding seats {{like the}} modern camp stool, and chairs with legs {{terminating}} in {{the heads of}} beasts or the feet of animals, Furniture still exist. Beds supported by lions paws XI. and XII. dynasties, from Gebelein, now in the Cairo Museum), headrests, 6 or 8 in. high, shaped like a crutch on a foot, very like those used by the native of New Guinea today, are carved with scenes, etc., in outline. In the British Museum may be seen a tiny little coffer, 4 in. by 21/2 in., with very delicate figures carved in low relief. This little box stands on cabriole legs 3/4 of <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>long</b> with claw feet, quite Louis Quinze in character. There are incense ladles, the handle representing a bouquet of lotus flowers, the bowl formed like the leaf of an aquatic plant with serrated edges from Gurnah during the XVIII. dynasty; mirror handles, representing a little pillar, or a lotus stalk, sometimes surmounted by a head of Hathor, the Egyptian Venus or of Bes, god of the toilet; pin-cushions, {{in the shape of}} a small round tortoise with holes in the back for toilet pins, which were also of wood with dog-head ends (XI. dynasty, Cairo Museum); and perfume boxes such as a fish, the two halves forming the bottom and top of the perfume or pomatum was removed by little wooden spoons, one shaped in the form of a cartouche emerging from a full-blown lotus, another shaped like the neck of a goose, a third consisting of a dog running with a fish in its closed mouth, the fish forming the bowl. The list might be prolonged, but enough has been said to show to what a pitch of refinement the art of wood-carving had reached thousands of years before the birth of Christ.|$|E

500|$|The concert {{opened with}} Spears taking the stage {{accompanied}} by four blonde female dancers {{to perform a}} short version of [...] "...Baby One More Time", wearing a silver beaded bra, a pleated white skirt and white boots. She wore a long brown (blond in later dates) wig to cover the head she had shaved {{two and a half}} months previously and appeared in physically good shape. (By now her hair was about <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>long,</b> and one of her dancers said of her hair without the wig, [...] "It's getting longer and she looks beautiful.") The show then segued into a flashy shortened version of [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U". Though while Spears performed the original choreography, the performance was compared to the style of the Pussycat Dolls. The dancers then left Spears alone onstage to perform a chair routine of [...] "Breathe on Me". They re-entered with a male fan from the audience with them and Spears giving him a lap dance. Half way through the lap dance, Spears disappeared for a costume change leaving her dancers to continue the performance. She then reappeared in a hot pink bra, white fur coat and jean skirt to perform [...] "Do Somethin'" [...] with Spears throwing air guitars to the crowd. The show then concluded with [...] "Toxic", which featured Spears and her dancers performing in a mix of Spears and Shakira dance styles. As the performance came to an end, Spears said [...] "Thank you so much. These are my dancers"– her only words during the show– and left the stage. The show lasted around 12–16 minutes.|$|E

The long-persisting fallen spiked fruits can be unpleasant to walk on; [...] sweet gum is banned in some places for this reason. [...] In abundance, they can leave a lawn lumpy.

2500|$|... "The colour {{after the}} last moult was a clear slaty-blue, {{changing}} eventually to a greenish tint, with light brown markings {{very much the same}} as those which characterise the rest of the group.

2500|$|In China {{there is}} an {{indigenous}} species of oat botanically known as Avena nuda or naked oat. The peculiar feature of this species is that the grains (which are very small) grow without any husk, being protected only by the chaff. The habit of the plant is likewise quite unique, four or five grains being suspended upon a thread-like filament about half <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>long.</b> The mating of this species with cultivated varieties has produced new breeds giving yields 50 to 100 per cent. heavier than the original cultivated parents, with a corresponding decrease in {{the thickness of the}} skin.|$|E

2500|$|The Chinese Shar-Pei is {{a unique}} and {{intelligent}} dog most often recognized for its wrinkles. Initially developed as a Chinese farm and hunting and later fighting dog, the breed does well today in obedience, agility, herding and tracking, with skills {{that would have been}} needed on the farm. Because the name Shar-Pei means [...] "sand coat", harshness is a distinctive feature in its two accepted coat types, either horse (short) or brush (up to <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>long).</b> Other unique qualities include black mouth pigment, a slightly [...] "hippo-like" [...] head shape, small ears, deep-set eyes and rising top-line.|$|E
