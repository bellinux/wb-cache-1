5|$|During the tour, Johnston had few {{opportunities}} with the bat, invariably batting at either No. 10 and No. 11 alongside Toshack, another tail-ender with little batting ability.N- Neither player ever passed 30 in their first-class career, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> only two Australians {{who failed to}} pass 50 during the tour. As Australia's other frontline bowlers were Miller, Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, all of whom scored centuries and more than 20 fifties each during their first-class career, Toshack and Johnston were rooted {{at the bottom of}} the batting order. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings many time due to their batting strength, Johnston only had 18 innings in his 21 first-class fixtures and scored 188 runs at 18.80, the third lowest average and aggregate. He scored 62 runs in the Tests at 20.66, including his highest first-class score of 29 in the Second Test at Lord’s.|$|E
5|$|During {{their first}} season (2005–06), F.C. United had the second-highest average {{attendance}} in English non-League football {{with an average}} gate of 3,059 and were the 87th best supported club across all divisions. Attendances fell {{in the next two}} seasons <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> 92nd best supported club in 2006–07 and 100th best supported club by 2007–08. Their average league attendance then levelled out at approximately 2,000 per game, before rising to an average of 2,155 in 2014–15, the then-seventh highest attendance in non-League football. After moving to Broadhurst Park in May 2015, the club averaged a gate of 3,394 in 2015–16, a season-on-season increase of over 57% and the fourth highest attendance in non-League football.|$|E
5|$|For an {{operation}} of the size and complexity of Frequent Wind, casualties were relatively light. Marine corporals McMahon and Judge killed at the DAO compound were the only members of US forces killed in action during the operation <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> last US ground casualties in Vietnam. A Marine AH-1J SeaCobra ran out of fuel while searching for the USS Okinawa and ditched at sea, the two crew members were rescued by a boat from USS Kirk. A CH-46F Swift 1-4 of HMM-164 from the USS Hancock flown by Captain William C. Nystul and First Lieutenant Michael J. Shea crashed into the sea on its approach to the ship after having flown a night sea and air rescue mission (SAR). The two enlisted crew members survived, but {{the bodies of the}} pilots were not recovered. The cause of the crash was never determined.|$|E

5|$|In response, India {{lost their}} key batsman, Sachin Tendulkar, {{at the start}} of the innings. Despite a brief {{interruption}} by rain after the 17th over, no time was lost from the game. Once play resumed, India lost wickets at regular intervals. Virender Sehwag top-scored for India with 82 runs, before the team were bowled out for 234 runs in the 40th over. For Australia, Glenn McGrath took three wickets for 52 runs, while Brett Lee and Andrew Symonds claimed two wickets each. Ponting was named man of the match for his 140, and Tendulkar, the tournament's leading run-scorer (673 runs), was awarded the man of the series. The final was Australia's seventeenth successive ODI win, a record, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> first team to win three World Cups. Ganguly's decision to bowl first in the match was criticised by journalists and former cricketers.|$|E
5|$|On {{the outer}} {{fringes of the}} few small gay {{communities}} were people who challenged gender expectations. They were effeminate men and masculine women, or people assigned male at birth who dressed and lived as women and people assigned female at birth who dressed and lived as men, respectively, either part or full-time. Contemporary nomenclature classified them as transvestites, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> most visible representatives of sexual minorities. They belied the carefully crafted image portrayed by the Mattachine Society and DOB that asserted homosexuals were respectable, normal people. The Mattachine and DOB considered the trials of being arrested for wearing clothing of the opposite gender as a parallel to the struggles of homophile organizations: similar but distinctly separate. Gay and transgender people staged a small riot at the Cooper Do-nuts cafe in Los Angeles in 1959 in response to police harassment.|$|E

5|$|The 2003 Football Fans Census {{revealed}} {{that no other}} team's supporters considered York to be among their club's main rivals. Traditionally, York's two main rivalries have been with Hull City and Scarborough. While York fans saw Hull as their main rival, this was not reciprocated by the East Yorkshire club, who saw Leeds United as their main rival. York also had a rivalry with Halifax Town <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> team most local to York when the two played in the Conference. A rivalry with Luton Town developed during the club's final years in the Conference as both clubs met regularly in crucial matches, accompanied {{by a series of}} contentious incidents involving crowd trouble, contentious transfers and complaints about the behaviour of directors.|$|E

25|$|Unlike other hobbits, the Bucklanders {{were more}} {{prepared}} for danger and less naive than the Shire-hobbits.

25|$|The Huron {{way of life}} is very gender-specific in practice. Men in most {{societies}} are the clear hunters of the tribe; they search for game to feed their people.

25|$|Istanbul inaugurated horse trams in 1872 {{and these}} served {{the people of}} Istanbul until 1912. Following this date, {{electric}} trams {{were put in place}} <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> main means for urban public transport until 1966. Many routes were built step by step, and it reached their most widespread network in 1956 with 108 million passengers in 270 shuttles in 56 lines. Tramcars were not modernized for many decades, and some of the 1911 electric cars were still running in the 1960s. At that time modern buses provided faster and smoother journeys. Because of those negative issues, tram system closed in mid-1960s.|$|E
25|$|The {{education}} of children {{has always been an}} important part of the work of the Fathers of the London Oratory in Brompton, Knightsbridge. They opened their first school in King William Street in the City of London in 1852 and two parochial schools in Chelsea in 1856. Seven years later, in 1863, at the request of Cardinal Wiseman, who wanted to provide a wider education for Catholic children than was available at that time, the Oratory Fathers established a school for boys in Chelsea, and in 1870 a school for girls staffed by the Daughters of the Cross. These schools were fee paying <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> forerunners of the present school.|$|E

25|$|As {{mandated}} by the Executive Order, a University of California team, led by Daniel Sperling of UC Davis and the late Alexander E. Farrell (UC Berkeley), developed two reports that established the technical feasibility of an LCFS, proposed the methodology to calculate the full life cycle GHG emissions from all fuels sold in the state, identified technical and policy issues, and provided a number of specific recommendations, thus providing an initial framework {{for the development of}} CARB's LCFS. This study was presented by Governor Schwarzenegger in May 2007 <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> backbone of CARB's initial efforts to develop the LCFS, even though not all of the specific recommendations were incorporated in the final LCFS staff's proposed regulation.|$|E
25|$|Each {{territory}} or county {{could be}} further divided into mandationes and decanias. The basic territorial division was the villa, centered on a church, and composed {{of one or more}} hamlets or villages, together with all its facilities, lands, and possessions. The villas perpetuated ancient Roman and Suevic foundations, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> base for the ecclesiastical organization, and for the economic production of the country, later evolving into the modern parroquias and freguesias (rural parishes). The local economy was subsistence, based mainly on the production of grain and beans, and notably in cattle breeding. Other valuable—though geographically restricted—products included fruits, salt, wine, honey, olive oil, horses, iron for the production of weapons and tools, and exotic oriental fabrics introduced from Spania. There were also specialized artisans who worked on demand, such as masons and goldsmiths.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Utah {{posted a}} record of 13–0 {{on their way to}} winning the MWC Championship, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> only undefeated team in the Football Bowl Subdivision. During the regular season, the Utes beat Michigan on the road and Oregon State, TCU, and BYU at home.

Four of the teams Utah beat ended the season in the Coaches' and AP Polls: Oregon State, TCU, BYU, and Alabama. Both TCU and Alabama ended in the Top-10. In the final Coaches' Poll and AP Poll, Utah finished at #4 and #2, respectively, for their highest ranking in each poll ever.|$|E
