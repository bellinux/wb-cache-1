25|$|The Brown Fairy Book {{contains}} {{stories from}} the American Indians, Australian Bushmen and <b>African</b> <b>Kaffirs,</b> and from Persia, Lapland, Brazil, and India.|$|R
5000|$|After {{their arrival}} in 1505, the Portuguese began {{to convert the}} Sinhalese to Roman Catholicism, {{building}} their wealth and power through the spice and slave trade. As early as 1630, <b>African</b> <b>Kaffirs</b> were brought to Sri Lanka to work as slaves or soldiers. The Kaffirs were once described as a people 'steeped in opium and witless with drink'. The Kaffirs' carefree spirit inspired two music forms known as chicote and kafrinha infusing them with humour and satire.|$|R
50|$|Lascarins {{were crucial}} for the occupying Portuguese forces, during their battles against local kingdoms because they knew the local geography. In almost every early battle the Portuguese fought in Sri Lanka, the {{majority}} of their army was composed of Lascarins. On many occasions the Lascarins changed sides and supported local kingdoms. In the 1594 Campaign of Danture the forces of Vimaladharmasuriya doubled {{as a result of these}} defections and in the Battle of Randeniwela, the Portuguese expedition of 1630, almost the entire contingent of Lascarcins defected. For this reason, the Portuguese started to rely more on Indian, <b>African</b> (<b>Kaffirs)</b> and Malay mercenaries in their offensive campaigns during the latter stages of their rule. Lascarins also took part on both sides during the Dutch-Portuguese War which ended the Portuguese occupation of coastal Sri Lanka.|$|R
500|$|While in South Africa, Gandhi {{focused on}} racial {{persecution}} of Indians, ignored those of Africans. In some cases, state Desai and Vahed, his behaviour {{was one of}} being a willing part of racial stereotyping and African exploitation. In a speech in September 1896 in India, for example, Gandhi complained the whites in British colony of South Africa were degrading Indian Hindus and Muslims to [...] "a level of Kaffir". Scholars cite it as an example evidence that Gandhi at that time felt about Indians and South <b>African</b> <b>Kaffir</b> differently. As another example given by Herman, Gandhi, at age 24, prepared a legal brief for the Natal Assembly in 1895, seeking voting rights for Indians. Gandhi cited race history and European Orientalists' opinions that [...] "Anglo-Saxons and Indians are sprung from the same Aryan stock or rather the Indo-European peoples", and argued that Indians should not be grouped with the Africans.|$|R
5000|$|Anita Meyer. Anita is JP's long-suffering wife. Unlike {{most of the}} film's other characters, {{she clearly}} has a dislike for the leader. During a {{conversation}} with Broomfield she sees Terre'Blanche as a domineering figure and tends {{not to speak of}} him in high regard. Anita works as a nurse and her chief concerns, according to Nick, are the distribution of condoms and the sterilisation of women. Like JP, she tends not to be very liberal in her views on black people and can be seen at an AWB rally smiling when a child proclaims that he'll hit any black child who attends his white school. She is also filmed with her pet cat which is named <b>kaffir</b> <b>cat.</b> The reason being, in her own words, is that the cat is black and as [...] "blacks are called kaffirs" [...] it has seemingly been 'appropriately named'. Broomfield would later to go on to dub Anita of [...] "kaffir cat fame" [...] in his follow up film in reference to the episode.|$|R
50|$|When Dutch colonialists {{arrived in}} about 1600, the Kaffirs worked on {{cinnamon}} plantations {{along the southern}} coast. The Kaffirs ancestors were chained up and forced by the Dutch {{to take on the}} Sinhalese Kingdom. After the Dutch were successfully repelled by the Sinhalese in 1796, the Kaffirs were further marginalized by an influx of Indian laborers, who were imported by the British and who took most work on tea and rubber estates. The descendants of the original <b>Africans</b> or <b>Kaffirs</b> survive in pockets along the island's coastal regions of Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Negombo.|$|R
5000|$|Portuguese Burghers {{are usually}} descended from a Sri Lankan {{mother and a}} Portuguese father, or a Sri Lankan mother of Portuguese descent and a Sri Lankan father (the former is more common). This {{configuration}} {{is also the case}} with the Dutch Burghers. When the Portuguese arrived on the island in 1505, they were accompanied by <b>African</b> slaves. <b>Kaffirs</b> are a mix of African, Portuguese colonist and Sri Lankan. The free mixing between the various groups of people was encouraged by the colonials. Soon the Mesti√ßos or the [...] "Mixed People" [...] began speaking a creole known as the Ceylonese-Portuguese Creole. It was based on Portuguese, Sinhalese and Tamil.|$|R
50|$|Sri Lankans of African descent {{are proud}} to be Sri Lankans. They also {{acknowledge}} their <b>African</b> history. <b>Kaffirs</b> have an orally recorded history by the families who are descendants of former Sinhalese slave traders. A substantial population among those Sri Lankans of African descent {{are believed to have}} roots in the region that today corresponds to the Republic of Mozambique. The community's classical traditions of dance and song performance are described as the strongest indicators of the communities cultural retention of and fidelity in preserving Africa's ancient traditions of religions, culture and civilization.The term Kaffir means 'non-believer' in the Arabic language, though it does not hold the same pejorative implications of the word as it would in countries like South Africa; its continued use by certain sections of Sri Lankan people is defended on the basis that term is not intended {{to be used as a}} racial slur.|$|R
5000|$|George Harrison {{is today}} {{credited}} {{as the man}} who discovered an outcrop of the Main Reef of gold on the farm Langlaagte in February 1886. The fledgling town of Johannesburg was laid out on a triangular wedge of [...] "uitvalgrond" [...] (area excluded when the farms were surveyed) named Randjeslaagte, situated between the farms Doornfontein to the east, Braamfontein to the west and Turffontein to the south. Within ten years of the discovery of gold in Johannesburg, 100,000 people flocked to this part of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republic in search of riches. They were of all races and all nationalities. In October 1887 the government of the ZAR bought the south-eastern portion of the farm Braamfontein. There were large quantities of clay, suitable for brickmaking, along the stream. The government decided that more money was to be made from issuing brick maker's licences at five shillings per month. The result was that many landless Dutch-speaking burghers (citizens) of the ZAR settled on the property and started making bricks. They also erected their shacks there. Soon the area was known either Brickfields or Veldschoendorp. Soon other working poor, Coloureds, Indians and Africans also settled there. The government, who sought to differentiate the white working class from the black, laid out new suburbs for the Burghers (Whites), Coolies (Indians), Malays (Coloureds) and <b>Kaffirs</b> (<b>Africans),</b> but the whole area simply stayed multiracial.|$|R
