5|$|In 2012, Metrorail {{opened its}} 23rd station, Miami Central Station, at Miami International Airport (MIA), opening a 16-station newly created Orange Line between the MIA and Dadeland South stations. The new line is {{expected}} to increase ridership significantly, adding millions of riders per year, and allowing residents and visitors alike direct access from the MIA to Downtown Miami, and greater connectivity between various modes of transit throughout Miami-Dade County. Central Station provides direct service to Amtrak inter-city rail services, Tri-Rail commuter rail, Greyhound Lines intercity bus, and the Rental Car Center. Miami Central Station {{is expected to}} attract 150,000 daily commuters <b>and</b> <b>travelers.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to a Maronite priest's complaints about harassment by Shia Muslims against Christians, Shahin's men attacked and plundered Shia villages <b>and</b> <b>travelers</b> in Jubail and demanded that Shia villages convert to Christianity to avoid assault. The Shia residents of Jubail protested these assaults in June 1859. While Shahin's actions further frustrated the local elites, Christian, Muslim and Druze alike, his reputation as the defender of Christian rights was bolstered at the popular level.|$|E
5|$|The {{part of the}} Sierra Nevada {{where the}} park is located was long {{considered}} to be a physical barrier to European American settlers, traders, trappers, <b>and</b> <b>travelers.</b> That situation changed in 1848 after gold was discovered in the foothills west of the range. Travel and trade activity dramatically increased in the area during the ensuing California Gold Rush. Resources depended upon by local Native Americans were depleted or destroyed, and disease brought by the newcomers spread rapidly through indigenous populations. Extermination of native culture became a policy of the United States Government.|$|E
40|$|Terrorism has {{generated}} fear amongst the traveling public, causing the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to improve upon existing airport checkpoint security procedures. Research {{has examined the}} effectiveness of these procedures, but few studies have examined travelers’ reactions to them. A model was created to assess travelers’ perceptions of airport checkpoint security measures across dimensions of TSA staff responsiveness, TSA staff assurance, traveler satisfaction, <b>traveler</b> perceived safety, <b>and</b> <b>traveler</b> intent to engage in positive word-of-mouth. Ten thousand (N = 10, 000) travelers were surveyed at 5 major airports around the United States (Honolulu International Airport, Nashville International Airport, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Washington Dulles International Airport, and John F. Kennedy International Airport). Statistically significant positive relationships were found between the variables of TSA staff responsiveness <b>and</b> <b>traveler</b> satisfaction, TSA staff assurance <b>and</b> <b>traveler</b> satisfaction, TSA staff assurance <b>and</b> <b>traveler</b> perceived safety, <b>traveler</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>traveler</b> intent to engage in positive word-of-mouth, <b>and</b> <b>traveler</b> perceived safety <b>and</b> <b>traveler</b> intent to engage in positive word-of-mouth. Additionally, <b>traveler</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>traveler</b> perceived safety were each shown to mediate the relationship between service quality (TSA staff responsiveness and TSA staff assurance combined) <b>and</b> <b>traveler</b> intent to engage in positive word-of-mouth. No significant relationship was found between TSA staff responsiveness <b>and</b> <b>traveler</b> perceived safety. Results suggest this model may be valuable for the TSA in refining existing airport checkpoint security procedures. Specifically, this model may help to identify potential ways for the TSA to improve travelers’ satisfaction, travelers’ perceived safety, and travelers’ intentions of speaking positively to others through word-of-mouth, which may ultimately contribute to the TSA’s efforts towards image management...|$|R

5|$|The {{reconstruction}} of NY205 transformed the road {{into the main}} north–south connection between West Oneonta and Oaksville. At the same time, the parallel Southern New York Railroad had become unprofitable as the highways running alongside the track had become more appealing to shippers <b>and</b> <b>travelers</b> than the railroad itself. In 1940, the railroad abandoned the section of its line between West Oneonta and Jordanville, Herkimer County. The track ran alongside state routes {{for most of its}} length, and the presence of NY205 and NY167 was noted as a contributing factor to the line's demise in the railroad's abandonment petition to the Interstate Commerce Commission.|$|E
5|$|With {{the coming}} of the war and {{construction}} of the ALCAN Highway, which connected to the Richardson south of Big Delta, road traffic waned further. The ferry crossing was replaced by a wooden bridge, and later, a larger steel bridge was constructed downriver. This caused rerouting of the highway away from the roadhouse, drawing off traffic <b>and</b> <b>travelers.</b> Wallen operated the roadhouse through the 1940s and early 1950s, although in later years guests were by invitation only. John Hajdukovich died in 1965, and Rika Wallen died four years later in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{construction}} in 1874, the Whipple truss {{bridge over the}} South Branch Potomac River served Romney <b>and</b> <b>travelers</b> along the Northwestern Turnpike for 63 years. In 1935, the West Virginia State Road Commission began organizing a project to replace the Whipple truss bridge, and construction of the new bridge had begun by 1936. In November of that year, a car collided with {{the south side of}} the eastern Whipple truss span, which knocked the span completely off its eastern abutment. The car plunged into the South Branch Potomac River, followed by the compromised truss span, which collapsed on top of the car. Unaware of the span's collapse, a car traveling from the west drove off the end of the west span at the bridge's center pier, and fell onto the collapsed span. According to the Hampshire Review, the only serious injury sustained was a broken wooden leg. Following the collapse of the eastern Whipple truss span, a temporary wooden span was hastily constructed between the western truss span and the eastern abutment, so that traffic was uninterrupted until the new bridge was completed and opened on June 21, 1937. The 1937 bridge was used until 2010 when it was replaced by the current South Branch Bridge.|$|E

5|$|Offshore impacts were significant; on 30January, {{the yacht}} Darkie washed ashore at South Brook Island, its crew of four surviving. Throughout Queensland, the cyclone {{isolated}} small towns, cut off telephone service, inflicted severe damage to crops, and generated widespread flooding. Between Cairns and Ingham, Winifred obliterated structures, toppled power lines, uprooted trees, wrecked 1000homes, and damaged hundreds of others. Service of the Sunlander between Gordonvale and Babinda was interrupted after tracks were inundated, <b>and</b> <b>travelers</b> {{were forced to}} travel by bus instead. At the latter city, approximately 500homes suffered significant damage, and at Innisfail, 200residences were destroyed. Several individuals were recovered safely from wreckage of a building collapse in each city. At Babinda, sixteen other structures were wrecked, with the cyclone unroofing an additional 50houses and flattening 40sheds. Five individuals were badly injured, two of them impaled by flying glass and other debris. Officials noted that the cyclone tore off the police station door and unroofed a Uniting Church. Helicopter reconnaissance indicated severe damage to sugarcane and banana crops {{as well as a}} critical electrical power tower, with considerable damage observed in the town proper.|$|E
