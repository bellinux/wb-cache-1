40|$|The UltraNet is a {{high speed}} network capable of rates up to one gigabit per second. It is a hub based network with four optical fiber links {{connecting}} each hub. Each link can carry up to 256 megabits of data, and the hub backplane is capable of one gigabit aggregate throughput. Host connections to the hub may be fiber, coax, or channel based. Bus based machines have <b>adapter</b> <b>boards</b> that connect to transceivers in the hub, while channel based machines use a personality module in the hub. One way that the UltraNet achieves its high transfer rates is by off-loading the protocol processing from the hosts to special purpose protocol engines in the UltraNet hubs.

Although there is hub resident and PC resident UltraNet software, this document treats only the host resident UltraNet software...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Our {{laboratory}} {{has previously}} {{reported on the}} basic design concepts of an updated FireWire based data acquisition system for depth-of-interaction detector systems designed at the University of Washington. The new version of our data acquisition system leverages the capabilities of modern field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) and puts almost all functions into the FPGA, including the FireWire elements, the embedded processor, and pulse timing and integration. The design is centered around an acquisition node board (ANB) that includes 64 serial ADC channels, one high speed parallel ADC, FireWire 1394 b support, the FPGA, a serial command bus and signal lines to support a rough coincidence window implementation to reject singles events from being sent on the FireWire bus. <b>Adapter</b> <b>boards</b> convert detector signals into differential paired signals to connect to the ANB.

Available Video cards were initially the Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) and Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) (the same two cards that were available for the type 5150 PC), with Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) and Professional Graphics Controller (PGC) becoming available in 1984.|$|E
50|$|Arduino {{microcontrollers}} are pre-programmed with a {{boot loader}} that simplifies uploading of {{programs to the}} on-chip flash memory. The default bootloader of the Aduino UNO is the optiboot bootloader. Boards are loaded with program code via a serial connection to another computer. Some serial Arduino boards contain a level shifter circuit to convert between RS-232 logic levels and transistor-transistor logic (TTL) level signals. Current Arduino boards are programmed via Universal Serial Bus (USB), implemented using USB-to-serial adapter chips such as the FTDI FT232. Some boards, such as later-model Uno boards, substitute the FTDI chip with a separate AVR chip containing USB-to-serial firmware, which is reprogrammable via its own ICSP header. Other variants, such as the Arduino Mini and the unofficial Boarduino, use a detachable USB-to-serial <b>adapter</b> <b>board</b> or cable, Bluetooth or other methods, when used with traditional microcontroller tools instead of the Arduino IDE, standard AVR in-system programming (ISP) programming is used.|$|E

Unless a computer has graphics capability built into the motherboard, that translation takes place on the graphics card. Depending on whether the image resolution is fixed, it may be of vector or raster type. Without qualifications, the term [...] "digital image" [...] usually refers to raster images also called bitmap images. Raster images that are composed of pixels and is suited for photo-realistic images. Vector images which are composed of lines and co-ordinates rather than dots and is more suited to line art, graphs or fonts. To make a 3-D image, the graphics card first creates a wire frame out of straight lines. Then, it rasterizes the image (fills in the remaining pixels). It also adds lighting, texture and color.|$|E

In this paper, we describe an approach for hardware support of transport layer protocols. Because of the high complexity of such protocols and various environmental conditions and requirements, such architecture must be very flexible and adaptable. Hence, we allow different configurations of the protocol engine, where specific protocol processing hardware, micro controllers or DSPs can be integrated. We outline a hardware/software partitioning, a heterogeneous protocol engine for protocol processing acceleration and describe its transparent integration into standard systems. In contrast to other approaches we reuse existing software implementations, significantly reducing the design complexity. The feasibility of this protocol engine is validated by utilising an intelligent network <b>adapter</b> <b>board.</b> For this implementation initial results are presented.

40|$|We {{conducted}} 47 exposures of {{four different}} MIC 4424 devices {{and did not}} observe any SEL or high-current events. This included worst-case conditions with a LET of 81 MeV-sq cm/mg, applied voltage of 18. 5 V, a case temperature greater than 120 C, and a final fluence of 1 x 10 (exp 7) /sq cm. We also monitored both the outputs {{for the presence of}} SETs. While the period of the 1 MHz square wave was slightly altered in some cases, no pulses were added or deleted. 1. Purpose: The purpose of this testing is to characterize the BiCMOS/DMOS Micrel MIC 4424 dual, non-inverting MOSFET driver for single-event latchup (SEL) susceptibility. These data will be used for flight lot evaluation purposes. 2. Devices Tested: The MIC 4423 / 4424 / 4425 family are highly reliable BiCMOS/DMOS buffer/driver MOSFET drivers. They are higher output current versions of the MIC 4426 / 4427 / 4428. They can survive up to 5 V of noise spiking, of either polarity, on the ground pin. They can accept, without either damage or logic upset, up to half an amp of reverse current (either polarity) forced back into their outputs. Primarily intended for driving power MOSFETs, the MIC 4423 / 4424 / 4425 drivers are suitable for driving other loads (capacitive, resistive, or inductive) which require low-impedance, high peak currents, and fast switching times. Heavily loaded clock lines, coaxial cables, or piezoelectric transducers are some examples. The only known limitation on loading is that total power dissipated in the driver must be kept within the maximum power dissipation limits of the package. Five (5) parts were provided for SEL testing. We prepared four parts for irradiation and reserved one piece as an un-irradiated control. More information about the devices can be found in Table 1. The parts were prepared for testing by removing the lid from the CDIP package to expose the target die. The parts were then soldered to small copper circuit <b>adapter</b> <b>boards</b> for easy handling. These parts are fabricated in a bulk BiCMOS/DMOS technology.

The success of these methods has lead to a demand for their application in research on real-world scene perception. However, we will argue that the technical implementation of eye-contingent mask (window) movement across a stable text cannot be applied to scene research. A new technique is proposed that allows graphical masks or windows of arbitrary form, size, and content to be moved quickly over a complex graphical stimulus. This moving overlay technique makes use of the ATVista graphics <b>adapter,</b> a <b>board</b> with the ability to mix an internally stored and an externally generated image into one composite image. A high-performance moving mask or window is created by programming the internal image to be movable and partly transparent. The technique is implemented on a standard personal computer interfaced with an eyetracker, thus bringing mask (window) movement under online eye-movement control. We discuss general principles of the technique and illustrate them with performance data from a concrete experimental setup. status: publishe...|$|R

One {{of the most common}} and popular methods to achieve this is by the use of cryptography.

These ASICs are specially developed for the CBM-ToF detector. An <b>adapter</b> <b>board</b> (R 2 F-Board) is used as an interface between the readout controller and the front-end cards, and an FPGA based readout controller (ROC) transfers then the data to the data acquisition (DAQ) hosted on a computer.
