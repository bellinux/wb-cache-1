5|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{questioned}} whether a royal affinity could actually {{work in the same}} way as <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> <b>one.</b> It has been suggested that since the king had to be a lord to his retainers and provide good lordship, but also king to the entire people, a contradiction existed, resulting in a decline in local stability where this occurred. At the same time, even powerful magnates such as Gaunt could cause local dissatisfaction by retaining some and, inevitably, excluding others. On the other hand, it has also been pointed out how, particularly for kings, recruitment into the affinity was a clear promotion which could act as an encouraging loyalty or offered a political amnesty.|$|E
25|$|His {{attitude}} from August 1914 was <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> <b>one,</b> too noble to be wise. He {{cared for}} the success of the British aims, especially insofar as they could be achieved by the Admiralty, and for nothing else. His passion for this aim was pure, self-devoted, and all-devouring. He failed to remember he was a politician.|$|E

Casanova thus began his third career, as a violinist in the San Samuele theater, [...] "a menial journeyman of a sublime art in which, if he who excels is admired, the mediocrity is rightly despised. ... My profession was not <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> <b>one,</b> but I did not care. Calling everything prejudice, I soon acquired all the habits of my degraded fellow musicians." [...] He and some of his fellows, [...] "often spent our nights roaming through different quarters of the city, thinking up the most scandalous practical jokes and putting them into execution ... we amused ourselves by untying the gondolas moored before private homes, which then drifted with the current". They also sent midwives and physicians on false calls.|$|E

"Your language, Signore," [...] {{observed}} Andrea Barrofaldi, with warmth, [...] "is {{no doubt}} <b>a</b> very <b>noble</b> <b>one,</b> for {{the language in}} which Shakespeare and Milton wrote cannot be else; but you will permit {{me to say that}} it has a uniformity of sound, with words of different letters, that I find as unreasonable as it is embarrassing to a foreigner." ...|$|R

60|$|To {{prove to}} you that I who 'used to care' for poetry do so still, and that I have not been {{absolutely}} idle lately, an 'Athenaeum' shall be sent to you containing a poem {{on the subject of}} the removal of Napoleon's ashes.[54] It is a fitter subject for you than for me. Napoleon is no idol of mine. I never made a 'setting sun' of him. But my physician suggested the subject as <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> <b>one</b> and then there was something suggestive in the consideration that the 'Bellerophon' lay on those very bay-waters opposite to my bed.|$|E
6000|$|... 69. And of yet greater {{importance}} is it deeply {{to know that}} every beauty possessed by the language of a nation is significant of the innermost laws of its being. Keep the temper of the people stern and manly; make their associations grave, courteous, and for worthy objects; occupy them in just deeds; and their tongue must needs be a grand one. Nor is it possible, therefore--observe the necessary reflected action--that any tongue should be <b>a</b> <b>noble</b> <b>one,</b> of which the words are not so many trumpet-calls to action. All great languages invariably utter great things, and command them; they cannot be mimicked but by obedience; the breath of them is inspiration {{because it is not}} only vocal, but vital; and you can only learn to speak as these men spoke, by becoming what these men were.|$|E

The Indian had been born to hunt his meat, to repel his red foes, to watch the clouds and serve his gods. But these white men would come like a great flight of grasshoppers to cover the length and breadth of the prairie-land. The buffalo would roll away, like a dust-cloud, in the distance, and never return. No meat for the Indian--no grass for his mustang--no place for his home. The Sioux must fight till he died or be driven back into waste places where grief and hardship would end him.|$|R
