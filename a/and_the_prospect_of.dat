5|$|Expectations {{were high}} for Norwich after they {{finished}} the previous season in 11th {{position in the}} league, their highest league finish since 1992–93. The £13.5million profit made during the 2011–12 season, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> becoming debt free, also raised {{the expectations of the}} fans with the prospect of significant spending on players over the summer 2013 transfer window.|$|E
5|$|Harding's general {{election}} opponent was Ohio Attorney General Timothy Hogan, who {{had risen to}} statewide office despite widespread prejudice against Roman Catholics in rural areas. In 1914, the start of World War I <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> a Catholic senator from Ohio increased nativist sentiment. Propaganda sheets with names like The Menace and The Defender contained warnings that Hogan was the vanguard in a plot led by Pope Benedict XV through the Knights of Columbus to control Ohio. Harding did not attack Hogan (an old friend) on this or most other issues, {{but he did not}} denounce the nativist hatred for his opponent.|$|E

5|$|In 1987 France took on pre-tournament favourites Australia at Concord Oval for a {{place in}} the final. In one of the {{greatest}} World Cup matches, the Australians appeared to be in control, leading 9–0, 15–12 and 24–21 at various stages of the match, only for the French to keep coming back. With the scores locked at 24–24 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> extra time looming, the French scored {{one of the most memorable}} tries in rugby history. Starting an attack from inside their own half, the French passed the ball through 11 pairs of hands before fullback Serge Blanco beat Wallabies hooker Tom Lawton to score a try in the corner. France won 30–24, and would face co-hosts New Zealand in the final at Eden Park. The French had not fully recovered from their magnificent effort in the semi-final, and New Zealand won the anti-climactic decider 29–9.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1930s {{the number}} of active {{personnel}} remained low and out of necessity training opportunities were limited. After 1936, however, the Army attempted to improve the conditions of service for its members and to reinvigorate the training program, while individual units began to undertake their own recruiting campaigns. Nevertheless, {{it was not until}} 1938, as tensions grew in Europe <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> war became more likely, that an attempt was made to expand the establishment of the Militia. At this time an effort was made to determine the readiness of the Militia to expand if mobilised. During the continuous training camps undertaken throughout 1938, each component unit was assessed with mixed results. The following year, 1939, saw further expansion {{and by the end of}} April of that year, the division's posted strength had grown to 9,589 personnel. As a part of this expansion, the divisional artillery was expanded by the re-raising of the batteries that had been disbanded in 1922.|$|E

25|$|Despite being world champion, Mansell had {{a public}} {{disagreement}} with Williams.

25|$|The {{economic}} downturn in Ireland {{was not a}} recession but a slowdown {{in the rate of}} economic expansion.

25|$|While the Saint-Maurice {{area has}} been {{fortified}} since medieval times, work on the National Redoubt began in the 1880s with Forts Dailly, Savatan and Scex.

25|$|Along {{with the}} desire for independence, {{tensions}} between Hindus and Muslims had also been developing over the years.

25|$|In the 19th-century German Kingdom of Saxony, Lutheran pastor Martin Stephan {{and many}} of his {{followers}} found themselves increasingly at odds with the rationalism, Christian ecumenism, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> a forced unionism of the Lutheran church with the Reformed church. In the neighboring Kingdom of Prussia, the Prussian Union of 1817 put in place what they considered non-Lutheran communion and baptismal doctrine and practice. In order to freely practice their Christian faith in accordance with the Lutheran confessions outlined in the Book of Concord, Stephan and between 600 and 700 other Saxon Lutherans left for the United States in November 1838.|$|E

25|$|As {{a long-standing}} ally of Pakistan, the People's Republic of China reacted with alarm to the {{evolving}} situation in East Pakistan <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> <b>of</b> India invading West Pakistan and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. Believing that {{just such an}} Indian attack was imminent, Nixon encouraged China to mobilise its armed forces along its border with India to discourage it. The Chinese did not, however, respond to this encouragement, because unlike the 1962 Sino-Indian War when India was caught entirely unaware, this time the Indian Army was prepared and had deployed eight mountain divisions to the Sino-Indian border to guard against such an eventuality. China instead threw its weight behind demands for an immediate ceasefire.|$|E
