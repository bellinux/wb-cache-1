500|$|OK Computer {{triggered}} a minor revival of progressive rock and ambitious concept albums, {{with a new}} wave of prog-influenced bands crediting OK Computer for enabling their scene to thrive. Brandon Curtis of Secret Machines said, [...] "Songs like Paranoid Android made it OK to write music differently, to be more experimental... OK Computer was important because it reintroduced unconventional writing and song structures." [...] Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree added, [...] "I don't think ambition is a dirty word any more. Radiohead were the Trojan Horse in that respect. Here's a band that came from the indie rock tradition that snuck in under the radar when the journalists weren't looking and started making these absurdly ambitious and pretentious—and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> for it—records." [...] In 2005, Q named OK Computer the tenth best progressive rock album ever.|$|E
500|$|In 1837, Holmes was {{appointed}} to the Boston Dispensary, where he was shocked by the poor hygienic conditions. That year he competed for and won both of the Boylston essay prizes. Wishing to concentrate on research and teaching, he, along with three of his peers, established the Tremont Medical School—which would later merge with Harvard Medical School—above an apothecary shop at 35 Tremont Row in Boston. There, he lectured on pathology, taught the use of microscopes, and supervised dissections of cadavers. He often criticized traditional medical practices and once quipped that if all contemporary medicine was tossed into the sea [...] "it would be <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> for mankind—and all the worse for the fishes". For the next ten years, he maintained a small and irregular private medical practice, but spent much of his time teaching. He served on the faculty of Dartmouth Medical School from 1838 to 1840, where he {{was appointed}} professor of anatomy and physiology. For fourteen weeks each fall, during these years, he traveled to Hanover, New Hampshire, to lecture. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1838.|$|E

So it's fitting that she wraps up the deluxe edition with the title track [...] Deep down, she does have a rebel heart— and you can't fault her for reminding us that pop music is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> for it". Of the leaked demo, Daniel Welsh from The Huffington Post, wrote that [...] "it’s taken the best parts of Avicii’s sound and blended them with Madonna, rather than giving us an ear-assaulting [...] "Avicii feat. Madonna" [...] number about 'putting your drinks up' and 'getting down on the floor'". Spin said it was the singer's [...] "sweetest melody since 'What It Feels Like for a Girl', with her register dropped an octave or two until it resembles the Liz Phair of 2005's (underrated) Somebody's Miracle". Q magazine called it a [...] "movingly autobiographical title track, where Madonna reflects at length on her career and her motivation.

500|$|Jaws {{received}} mostly positive reviews upon release. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{called it}} [...] "a sensationally effective action picture, a scary thriller that works <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> because it's populated with characters {{that have been}} developed into human beings". Varietys A. D. Murphy praised Spielberg's directorial skills, and called Robert Shaw's performance [...] "absolutely magnificent". According to The New Yorkers Pauline Kael, it was [...] "the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made... more zest than an early Woody Allen picture, a lot more electricity, [...] it's funny in a Woody Allen sort of way". For New Times magazine, Frank Rich wrote, [...] "Spielberg is blessed with a talent that is absurdly absent from most American filmmakers these days: this man actually knows how to tell a story on screen.... It speaks well of this director's gifts that some of the most frightening sequences in Jaws are those where we don't even see the shark." [...] Writing for New York magazine, Judith Crist described the film as [...] "an exhilarating adventure entertainment of the highest order" [...] and complimented its acting and [...] "extraordinary technical achievements". Rex Reed praised the [...] "nerve-frying" [...] action scenes and concluded that [...] "for the most part, Jaws is a gripping horror film that works beautifully in every department".|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{was also}} {{pleased with the}} episode, noting that Hermes' and Bender's team-up worked well and that the ending was cathartic. [...] He found the episode to be his {{favorite}} of the new season, giving it a 9/10 and stating, [...] "after an okay start, [...] {{turned out to be}} my favorite episode of this comeback season so far. The more I think about it, the more pleasure I find in it. It was an episode full of laughs, action and the kind of emotional tug the series has been missing of late." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste gave the episode a rating of 8.7/10 and wrote: [...] "Judging from this episode and the last it seems like Futurama is intentionally straying away from its old groupings and trying new things. The sixth season is moving off from the repetition of its first two episodes and is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> for it." [...] Though he felt the episode was weaker with its jokes, he noted that this [...] "is frequently the case in with episodes that deal more with the characters and less about making jokes in a wacky world. But this isn't something I think will bother real fans, as that's part of what's given Futurama its cult audience in the first place: that the show gives a damn about its characters." ...|$|E

500|$|Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani, Joe Levy of Billboard, and Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone each {{awarded the}} album 3.5 out of 5 stars. Cinquemani {{wrote that the}} album was [...] "all over the map", yet felt it was [...] "a {{surprisingly}} coherent one". Levy wrote that the album was [...] "subtle" [...] compared to [...] "current standards", adding that: [...] "These songs unfold slowly, building through foreplay-like intros before hooks are displayed over a shifting series of textures". Ganz felt that Rebel Heart [...] "is at its strongest when Madonna shoves everyone {{to the side and}} just tells it to us straight", and added: [...] "Deep down, Madonna does have a rebel heart– and you can't fault her for reminding us that pop music is <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> for it". Jamieson Cox of Time commended the album for its consistent production and sound, and for Madonna's vocals and songwriting. Giving it a rating of [...] "B", Kyle Anderson and Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly called the album [...] "Madonna's best outing since 2000's Music". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian and Time Out writer Nick Levine gave the album 3 out of 5 stars. Petridis felt that the two contrasting sides of the album did not [...] "quite gel", reasoning that: [...] "the former might represent the music Madonna wants to make, while the latter is the music she feels obliged to make". Levine wrote: [...] "'Rebel Heart' may lack cohesion, but she's definitely not down for the count: this contains some of the best music Madonna's made in a decade".|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{preferred}} Paltrow's {{return in}} the [...] "Sexy" [...] installment to her initial appearance.

In contrast, Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly had mixed feelings about Holly and believed that she dominated screen time. VanDerWerff liked Paltrow's acting, but disliked Holly's interaction with Will, saying they lacked [...] "chemistry". Soraya Roberts of the Daily News disliked her return for prolonging Will and Emma's separation, branding Holly a home-wrecker. She commented that while Paltrow's appearance in [...] "The Substitute" [...] was [...] "relatively fresh", in [...] "Sexy" [...] she was [...] "acting almost like a cardboard cutout version of her former self, overly enunciating her lines [...] treading carefully around her choreography". Poniewozik found all of Paltrow's scenes [...] "labored and ridiculous", and wrote that the actress failed to bring an element of realism to her character. Canning said that [...] "the moment she came on screen the whole episode lit up", and the episode was a [...] "fun and funny showcase for everybody's favorite recurring character", and Futterman echoed him when she called Paltrow [...] "our new favorite cast member".|$|E

500|$|... "The Man from Jupiter" [...] {{was widely}} lauded by {{television}} commentators. In his A- review, Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{felt that the}} episode contained many great moments and {{felt that it was}} a strong opening for the season. VanDerWerff wrote: [...] "Archer has always been a show I enjoyed more for the fast-paced dialogue and weird office plots, but every so often, the show does something pretty awesome, even on what's probably a fairly limited budget, and it turns out an action sequence that you just won't see on most other animated shows. FX has usually chosen to open seasons with these big action episodes, for fairly obvious reasons, and this one has the added benefit of Burt Reynolds hanging out as another potential ratings bump." [...] VanDerWerff noted that the storyline between Sterling Archer and his mother Malory Archer was the highlight of [...] "The Man from Jupiter"; [...] "Archer's so often at odds with her because he's unable to see her as a person and not just his mother, as Reynolds expresses while roaring down the highway at dangerously high speeds. Until Archer accepts that Malory has needs—some of them sexual—he’s always going to be trapped in a weird, co-dependent relationship with her. Archer isn't a show that tries to shove tons and tons of deep character moments into its episodes, which makes it <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> when it does do so. The show usually nails those little moments, and this was no exception." [...] Creative Loafing journalist Scott Harrel asserted, [...] "If the debut episode is any indication, you can expect another satisfying season from this intelligent, imaginative and button-pushing mix of high and low humor." [...] Ross Bonaime of Paste issued the installment an 8.8 out of ten rating, signifying a [...] "commendable" [...] rating. Bonaime affirmed that Reed adequately developed the characters, citing that [...] "The Man from Jupiter" [...] further established greater expectations for the series.|$|E

2500|$|In his 1895 {{article for}} the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary, the philosopher and critic Vladimir Solovyov argued that Maykov's {{dominant}} characteristics were [...] "a serene, contemplating tone, elaborate patterns, a distinct and individual style (in form, although not in colors) with a relatively lackluster lyric side, the latter suffering obviously from {{too much attention to}} details, often {{at the expense of the}} original inspiration."

The concept of Byzantium, as the second Rome, though, has not crystallized as clear and distinct in the poet's mind as that of the original Roman Empire. He loves Byzantine/Russia in its historical reality, refusing to admit its faults and contradictions, tending to glorify even such monsters as Ivan the Terrible, whose [...] "greatness", he believes, will be [...] "recognised" [...] in due time.
