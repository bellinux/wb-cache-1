40|$|A {{key problem}} in {{multimedia}} systems is the faithful reproduction of color. One {{of the main}} reasons why this is a complicated issue are the different color reproduction technologies used by the various devices; displays use easily modeled <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> mixing, while <b>printers</b> use a subtractive process, the characterization of which is much more complex than that of self–luminous displays. In order to resolve these problems several processing steps are necessary, one of which is accurate device characterization. Our study examines different learning algorithms for one particular neural network technique which already {{has been found to be}} useful in related contexts – namely radial basis function network models – and proposes a modified learning algorithm which improves the colorimetric characterization process of printers. In particular our results show that is possible to obtain good performance by using a learning algorithm that is trained on only small sets of color samples, and use it to generate a larger look–up table (LUT) through use of multiple polynomial regression or an interpolation algorithm. We deem our findings to be a good start point for further studies on learning algorithms used in conjunction with this problem...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Digital cameras {{capable of}} 24 -bit color (16. 8 million colors) provide {{a unique and}} {{relatively}} inexpensive tool for teaching the physics of light. Many students are familiar with colors obtained by mixing different colors of paint. These color combinations represent subtractive color. Projected light, such as that emanating {{from the sun and}} reflected by objects, combines to form different <b>additive</b> <b>colors.</b> The concept of <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> may be more difficult for students to grasp because experimenting with this concept is perhaps more difficult in comparison to mixing paints. Yet, color televisions and computer monitors rely on the concept of <b>additive</b> <b>color</b> to display their many different colors.

40|$|Accompanying the {{explosive}} growth {{in the use of}} computers, brought on by the recent “Internet boom, ” and the trend toward more data requiring color, growth in the <b>color</b> <b>printer</b> market has continued at a rapid pace. In offices, data coloration has started and the arrival of <b>color</b> <b>printers</b> with high image quality is keenly awaited. As one possible solution, there is the tandem-type <b>color</b> electrophotographic <b>printer</b> which uses LED printheads. Comparing this LED tandem printer to a normal laser scanner type printer, the former needs no rotary mechanism, such as a polygon mirror, so it can be smaller and operate faster. However, to achieve <b>color</b> <b>printers</b> with even faster speeds and even better image quality, LED printheads are required which have higher light output and higher resolution. In addition, because tandem-type <b>color</b> LED <b>printers</b> require four printheads, there is a demand for “low cost LED printheads. ” In response to this need, we have found a solution by developing a new LED printhead. It incorporates [a] a new type of LED array 1, 2) which has a luminescent element characterized by high light output and high density and [b] a matrixshaped multi-layer wiring configuration. Here we discuss each characteristic and specification of the LED printhead we developed and the advantages of the new type of LED array which is the key element of the head...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies optimal {{tracking}} performance {{issues for}} multi-input-multi-output linear time-invariant systems under networked control with limited bandwidth and <b>additive</b> <b>colored</b> white Gaussian noise channel. The tracking performance {{is measured by}} control input energy and {{the energy of the}} error signal between the output of the system and the reference signal with respect to a Brownian motion random process. This paper focuses on two kinds of network parameters, the basic network parameter-bandwidth and the <b>additive</b> <b>colored</b> white Gaussian noise, and studies the tracking performance limitation problem. The best attainable tracking performance is obtained, and the impact of limited bandwidth and <b>additive</b> <b>colored</b> white Gaussian noise of the communication channel on the attainable tracking performance is revealed. It is shown that the optimal tracking performance depends on nonminimum phase zeros, gain at all frequencies and their directions unitary vector of the given plant, as well as the limited bandwidth and <b>additive</b> <b>colored</b> white Gaussian noise of the communication channel. The simulation results are finally given to illustrate the theoretical results. Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Paper...|$|R
