The third concern in 1948 was to construct an all-weather highway between Kindersley and Alsask, and this too was requested of the Department of Highways (DOH). [...] In 1950, the rates of pay for roadwork were 60 cents an hour for a single labourer, 80 cents an hour for man and two horses, a labourer with four horses would earn C$1.00 per hour and for man with six horses $1.20 per hour [...] In the 1950s the R.M. provided grants to the local snow plough club to keep the highway clear after storms.

She recalls it was an awkward situation, even though the older sorority sister was [...] "unfailingly gracious" [...] to the younger one. In recognizing the younger woman's attractions, she began to suspect her own sexuality. She said, [...] "I {{saw a lot of}} it happening and I didn't {{know what to make of}} it.

[...] Another sorority sister was physically remarkable, very tall—almost , with <b>a</b> <b>husky</b> voice and boyish nickname, that Bannon imagined was a blend of Johnny Weissmuller and Ingrid Bergman.

Laura has to choose between a straight woman with a wild and curious streak, and a fascinating new character {{that proved to be}} her most popular of the series, Beebo Brinker, who came to embody the description of a thoroughly butch lesbian. Beebo was smart, handsome, chivalrous, and virile. Once again based on what Bannon knew, Beebo was nearly [...] tall with <b>a</b> <b>husky</b> voice and a formidable physique. The personality however, Bannon says, was drawn out of her sheer need for Beebo to exist. After spending time in Greenwich Village and not finding anyone like her, Bannon instead created her. She remembered, [...] "I put Beebo together just as I wanted her, in my heart and mind... She was just, quite literally, the butch of my dreams."
