[...] Hitchens also presented what he feels {{is a problem with}} the focus of the Pope's speech with respect to Reason: [...] "now its new reactionary leader has really 'offended' the Muslim world, while simultaneously <b>asking</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> distrust the only reliable weapon—reason—that we possess in these dark times. A fine day's work, and one that we could well have done without." ...|$|E

Both political supporters and opponents remarked on DeLay's ability to sway the votes of his party, a method DeLay described as [...] "growing the vote". DeLay was noted for involving lobbyists {{in the process of}} passing House bills. One lobbyist said, [...] "I've had members pull me aside and ask me to talk to another member of Congress about a bill or amendment, but I've never been asked to work on a bill—at least like they are <b>asking</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> whip bills now."

2500|$|Despite {{initially}} {{complying with}} ideological requirements, Baconsky was often subject to {{criticism in the}} official press. This occurred frequently after 1953, when Soviet politico Georgy Malenkov disavowed proletkult, criticizing its exponents for having authored a bland and distant form of literature (an accusation which Baconsky was regularly faced with from that moment on). Criticism was expressed early on by poet Veronica Porumbacu, who reproached him having published too little [...] "when the people is <b>asking</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> participate with all forces in the struggle." [...] Also in 1953, Paul Georgescu, literary columnist at Scînteia, the main Communist Party organ, reacted against the Steaua leadership, and argued that Baconsky personally had developed [...] "a high-flown style, designed to hide his unfamiliarity with life and lack of ideas." [...] Georgescu also claimed that Baconsky's travel accounts had failed to show [...] "how [...] people live, how this country looks today [...] ", and that his poems displayed various ideological mistakes. Writing for Viaţa Românească, critic Eugen Campus endorsed earlier pronouncements and added that, although Baconsky was a [...] "talented poet", he found his contributions showed [...] "a tendency to repeat oneself—for all the originality it covets". Literary historian Ana Selejan notes that, upon {{the end of the}} debates, the poet found himself was [...] "blacklisted" [...] by the official critics.|$|E
