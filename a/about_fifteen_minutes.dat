5|$|Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel aired Monday {{nights at}} 7:30p.m. on the NBC Blue Network to {{thirteen}} network affiliates in nine Eastern and Southern states. Twenty-six episodes were made, which were broadcast between November 28, 1932 and May 22, 1933. Each episode is {{introduced by the}} Blue Network announcer and features <b>about</b> <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> of drama and ten minutes of orchestral music between acts. The episodes end with Groucho and Chico – not in character, but as themselves – performing a 60-second skit promoting Esso and Essolube.|$|E
5|$|The Do 217s trailed {{the fleet}} for some time, but the Italian fleet did not open fire upon {{sighting}} them; they were trailing the fleet {{at such a}} distance {{that it was impossible}} to identify them as Allied or Axis, and Bergamini believed that they were the air cover promised to them by the Allies. However, an attack upon Italia and Roma at 15:37 spurred the fleet into action, as the anti-aircraft batteries onboard opened fire and all ships began evasive maneuvers. <b>About</b> <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> after this, Italia was hit on the starboard side underneath her fore main turrets, while Roma was hit on the same side somewhere between frames 100 and 108. This bomb passed through the ship and exploded beneath the keel, damaging the hull girder and allowing water to flood the after engine room and two boiler rooms. The flooding caused the inboard propellers to stop for want of power and started a large amount of arcing, which itself caused many electrical fires in the aft half of the ship.|$|E
5|$|Initial weather {{forecasts}} predicted rain for the Thursday qualifying sessions, but {{it failed}} to materialise. The teams had two full sessions of clear but hot and humid conditions. Nick Tandy's Porsche led the session with a three minutes and 18.862 seconds lap, but remained in third position on the provisional grid. Audi No. 7 {{was the only other}} car to put in an improved lap time amongst the top ten cars. TDS Racing was the fastest LMP2 car in the session with a three minutes and 40.441 seconds yet still over two seconds behind the pole time of KCMG. The LMGTE categories also remained much the same, as Aston Martin still occupied the top four qualifying positions. Twice the session was stopped for heavy accidents, first for the No. 55 AF Corse Ferrari of Duncan Cameron who became stuck in a gravel trap for <b>about</b> <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes.</b> The second stoppage occurred when Jan Magnussen suffered a mechanical failure in his No. 63 Chevrolet Corvette C7.R and hit the barriers twice in the Porsche Curves. Repairs to the barriers forced the cancellation of the remainder of the session, although half an hour was added to the final qualifying session. Magnussen was transported to the track's medical centre for a check-up and later released by the race organiser's medical staff. The Corvette was unable to be repaired and the team was forced to withdraw from the race because they did not bring a spare chassis to Le Mans.|$|E

These operate from Oslo via Kristiansand to Stavanger. Songdalen is a suburb of Kristiansand and 69 percent of the municipality's workforce commutes to the city. The train uses nine minutes to Kristiansand Station. Driving time by car is <b>about</b> <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes,</b> although significantly longer during rush-hour.

Once the playoffs came, they notched a 4-2 win over William and Mary in the first round. However, in the second round, they fell to Radford 5-2. So far, in the 2016-17 campaign, the team is performing admirably at 6-4-1. The team has a longstanding rivalry with the University of Richmond ice hockey team which always proves to be very entertaining and draws a sizable crowd.

25|$|Dr. David R. Williams (NASA {{archivist}} at Goddard Space Flight Center) and Apollo 11 {{flight director}} Eugene F. Kranz both {{acknowledged that the}} Apollo 11 telemetry data tapes are missing. Conspiracists see this as evidence that they never existed. The Apollo 11 telemetry tapes were different from the telemetry tapes of the other Moon landings because they contained the raw television broadcast. For technical reasons, the Apollo 11 lander carried a slow-scan television (SSTV) camera (see Apollo TV camera). To broadcast the pictures to regular television, a scan conversion had to be done. The radio telescope at Parkes Observatory in Australia was able to receive the telemetry from the Moon {{at the time of}} the Apollo 11 moonwalk. Parkes had a bigger antenna than NASA's antenna in Australia at the Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station, so it received a better picture. It also received a better picture than NASA's antenna at Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex. This direct TV signal, along with telemetry data, was recorded onto one-inch fourteen-track analog tape at Parkes. The original SSTV transmission had better detail and contrast than the scan-converted pictures, and it is this tape that is missing. A crude, real-time scan conversion of the SSTV signal was done in Australia before it was broadcast worldwide. However, still photos of the original SSTV image are available (see photos). <b>About</b> <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> of it were filmed by an amateur 8 mm film camera and these are also available. Later Apollo missions did not use SSTV. At least some of the telemetry tapes from the ALSEP scientific experiments left on the Moon (which ran until 1977) still exist, according to Dr. Williams. Copies of those tapes have been found.|$|E

At 13:37, Cöln made a 16-point turn and returned fire at the battlecruisers; the British ships turned to port to steam closer to Cöln, which in turn similarly altered course to escape. She was hit several times, however, including one hit that killed Maass. At 13:56, another German cruiser arrived on the scene, which distracted the British ships and allowed Cöln to slip away to the north. <b>About</b> <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> later, she turned back south-east to return to port.|$|E
500|$|Through its eleven witnesses, {{the defence}} {{established}} an alibi for Thornton.

The Holden farm was [...] from the pit, depending on the path taken. At about 4:50a.m., Thornton was seen at Castle Bromwich by a gamekeeper, John Heydon. Thornton told Heydon that he was with a woman much of the night, and after the two spent <b>about</b> <b>fifteen</b> <b>minutes</b> conversing, Thornton went on towards his father's house. The defence contended that for Thornton to have murdered Ashford, {{he would have had}} to chase her down, rape her, kill her, and then travel , all in at most eleven minutes.|$|E
500|$|Because of the crew's inexperience, filming was a [...] "comedy of errors". The {{first day}} of filming led to the crew getting lost in the woods during a scene shot on a bridge.

One notably gruesome moment on set involved ripping off Baker's eyelashes during removal of her face-mask. Because of the low budget, contact lenses as thick as glass had to be applied to the actors to achieve the [...] "demonic eyes" [...] effect.

40|$|Redshift-space distortions in galaxy surveys happen {{along the}} radial direction, {{breaking}} statistical translation invariance. We construct estimators for radial distortions that, using only Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) of the overdensity field multipoles {{for a given}} survey geometry, compute the power spectrum monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole, and generalize such estimators to the bispectrum. Using realistic mock catalogs we compare the signal to noise of two estimators for the power spectrum hexadecapole that require different number of FFTs and measure the bispectrum monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole. The resulting algorithm is very efficient, e. g. for the BOSS survey requires about three minutes for ℓ= 0, 2, 4 power spectra for scales up to k= 0. 3 h/Mpc and <b>about</b> <b>fifteen</b> additional <b>minutes</b> for ℓ= 0, 2, 4 bispectra for all scales and triangle shapes up to k= 0. 2 h/Mpc on a single core. The speed of these estimators is essential as it makes possible to compute covariance matrices from large number of realizations of mock catalogs with realistic survey characteristics, and paves the way for improved constrains of gravity on cosmological scales, inflation and galaxy bias.

Mini lectures, of <b>about</b> <b>fifteen</b> to twenty <b>minutes,</b> may be a great tool to introduce a new topic and cover {{the most important part of}} the learning material.
