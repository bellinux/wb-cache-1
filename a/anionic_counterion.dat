40|$|The {{synthesis}} and fluorescent {{analysis of}} chiral light emitting ionic liquids made from lanthanide-doped chiral amino acid ionic liquids {{is described in}} this thesis. The ionic liquids were composed of tetrabutylammonium (TBA) cation with enantiomers of the amino acids valine, proline, and aspartate as <b>anionic</b> <b>counterions.</b> These ionic liquids of varying amino acid composition were doped with europium trifluoromethanesulfonate (triflate) and analyzed by circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The sign of the CPL signal corresponded to the handedness of the amino acids in the ionic liquids. Europium triflate concentration dependent CPL in both [TBA][Val] and [TBA][L-Pro] ionic liquids was measured from 5 to 30 millimolal. Although the effect of concentration on the europium environment was inconclusive, CPL spectra compared across ionic liquids indicated that ionic liquid properties play an important role...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well-known}} that the variation of noncovalent interactions of luminophores, such as pi-pi interaction, metal-to-metal interaction, and hydrogen-bonding interaction, can regulate their emission colors. Electrostatic interaction {{is also an}} important noncovalent interaction. However, very few examples of luminescence color tuning induced by electrostatic interaction were reported. Herein, a series of Zn(II) -bis(terpyridine) complexes (Zn-AcO, Zn-BF 4, Zn-ClO 4, and Zn-PF 6) containing different <b>anionic</b> <b>counterions</b> were reported, which exhibit counterion-dependent emission colors from green-yellow to orange-red (549 to 622 nm) in CH 2 Cl 2 solution. More importantly, {{it was found that the}} excited states of these Zn(II) complexes can be regulated by changing the electrostatic interaction between Zn 2 + and counterions. On the basis of this controllable excited state, white light emission has been achieved by a single molecule, and a white light-emitting device has been fabricated. Moreover, a novel type of data decryption system with Zn-PF 6 as the optical recording medium has been developed by the two-photon excitation technique. Our results suggest that rationally controlled excited states of these Zn(II) complexes by regulating electrostatic interaction have promising applications fields, such as light-emitting devices, information recording, security protection, and so on.

30|$|Acid {{synthesis}} {{through the}} S+X−I+ pathway {{is one of}} the important developments of mesoporous materials. It can generate a number of industrially important morphologies [13, 14] due to the weak interaction between similarly charged cationic silica precursor (I+) and cationic surfactant (S+) mediated by the <b>anionic</b> <b>counterion</b> (X−) supplied by an acid or salt. The weak interaction triggers several topological defects that emerge as rich morphologies such as spheres, rods, fibers, and gyroids [15, 16]. Control over the S+X−I+ acidic interaction was broadly investigated to induce structural transformation and to tune the morphological features. This was done by varying the type of surfactant and co-surfactant [17] or co-solvent [18] (influence S+), type and concentration of acid [19] or salt [20] (affect X−), as well as pH [21] and silica type [22] (affect I+). Shear forces induced by mixing also {{play a vital role in}} determining the final morphology of the product [23].|$|E
40|$|We have {{performed}} molecular modeling of membrane systems by employing the classical molecular dynamics method and force field parameterizations. In this thesis, our main interest {{is on the}} structural and dynamic properties of charged model membrane systems. This thesis consists of four related projects. The first project focuses on cationic DMPC (dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine) / DOTAP (dimyristoyltrimethylammonium propane) lipid bilayers {{in the presence of}} chloride ions. We study the electrostatic interactions involving the dipolar headgroups of DMPC, the cationic headgroups of DOTAP, <b>anionic</b> <b>counterions,</b> and water molecules in the hydration zone of the membranes. We also investigate the effects of longer and unsaturated hydrocarbon chains of DOTAP on the structural properties of the mixed DMPC/DOTAP bilayers. In the second project, we consider an anionic POPG (palmitoyloleolyphosphatidylglycerol) lipid bilayer in the presence of sodium ions as counterions. We study the electrostatic interactions between the sodium ions and different groups in POPG molecules. We find that the sodium ions tend to bind strongly to the carbonyl oxygens instead of the phosphodiester oxygens. This kind of binding results in the formation of extensive lipid clusters, in which the lipids are bridged via sodium ions. The hydrogen bonds are also investigated as well as other properties such as the ordering of water molecules near the lipid bilayer. Then, using the POPG model developed in the previous study, we have investigated a bacterial model membrane consisting of 75 % zwitterionic POPE (palmitoyloleolyphosphatidylethanolamine) and 25 % anionic POPG. The intraand inter-molecular hydrogen bonds between the POPE and POPG molecules are analyzed and compared to separate simulations of pure POPE and pure POPG bilayers. We find that the hydrogen bonds contribute considerably to the interfacial properties of the mixed POPE/POPG bilayer. Another important observation is the formation of ion-lipid bridges and lipid clusters, which have not been found in other studies. We propose that as possible mechanism how bacteria may be able to control their permeability against solvents. In the fourth project we study the dynamic behavior of water molecules in the vicinity of different lipid bilayer surfaces. In this work, we have analyzed the interface effects of three different lipid bilayers – POPC, POPE, and POPG on water dynamics. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Absorption and {{fluorescence}} emission {{properties of}} cyanine-oxonol mixed dyes, i. e., salts formed by a cationic cyanine with an <b>anionic</b> oxonol as <b>counterion,</b> were investigated both theoretically and experimentally {{in order to}} probe the effects of ion pairing occurring in low-polarity solvents. We analyzed, in particular, three model systems (S 1, S 2, and S 3) built combining thiacarbo- and thiadicarbocyanine (C 1, C 2) with two vinylogous oxonol chromophores (A 1 /A 1 F, A 2). in systems S 1 (C 1 -A 1) and S 2 (C 2 -A 2), where the visible absorption bands of the individual ions are almost superimposed, the formation of ion pairs gives rise to marked spectral alterations traceable to interchromophore resonance interactions. On the contrary, in system 53 (C 2 -A 1 F), whose components absorb widely apart, the spectrum of the contact ion pair {{and that of the}} dissociated form differ only for the relative band intensities. In both cases, however, contact ion pairing results in complete quenching of the emission of the chromophoric units. Such behaviors, emphasized by absorption and fluorescence emission and excitation spectra of both the mixed dyes and their components in solvents of different polarities, were the subject of a theoretical study based in particular on the calculation of structures and electronic spectra of the contact ion pairs. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and local full geometry optimizations led to two types of structures characterized by almost parallel and orthogonal arrangements of the long molecular axes. CS INDO SCI calculations using both arrangements emphasized the role of the exciton coupling between the local HOMO-LUMO excitations of the two chromophoric units. The most striking spectral characteristics in low-polarity solvent turned out to be explainable in terms of parallel type arrangements, even if an appreciable contribution of the orthogonal type structure was to be invoked for a complete interpretation of the S 1 spectral properties. In all contact ion pairs, independently of the structure, the lowest excited singlet is a forbidden anion [...] > cation charge transfer (CT) state explaining why no fluorescence emission was observed in such systems...|$|R
