5|$|Aromatic {{aldehydes}} produce <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> (E)-alkenes. In case (Z)-alkenes from aromatic aldehydes are needed, the Still-Gennari modification (see below) can be used.|$|E
5|$|Cockercombe tuff is a greenish-grey, hard {{pyroclastic}} rock {{formed by the}} compression of volcanic ash and is found <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> in the south-eastern end of the Quantock Hills.|$|E
5|$|Part III {{concerns}} itself <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> with Shaun, in {{his role}} as postman, having to deliver ALP's letter, which was referred to in Part I, but never seen.|$|E
5|$|Penguins are a {{group of}} aquatic, flightless birds living <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> in the Southern Hemisphere, {{especially}} in Antarctica. One species breeds on the Tasmanian coast, while another ten have been recorded as vagrants.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} the Kingdom was <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> based on {{subsistence}} agriculture until the 15th century. After the 15th century, however, the economy became diversified and commercialized as it became incorporated into the expanding Indian ocean.|$|E
5|$|The wing {{had served}} <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> in North Germany and the Netherlands until now, {{when it was}} {{transferred}} to Central and Western Germany before moving to France, providing air cover over the Army (Wehrmacht) during the Battle of Normandy.|$|E
5|$|After going 25–2 in {{his first}} two years of college baseball, he was drafted in the 30th round by the Texas Rangers in 2003. Feldman had Tommy John surgery later that year. He {{followed}} it up with a minor league career in which he had a 2.70 ERA, and held batters to only 6.6 hits per 9 innings, pitching <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> in relief.|$|E
5|$|As Black, Fischer {{would usually}} play the Najdorf Sicilian against 1.e4, and the King's Indian Defense against 1.d4, only rarely venturing into the Nimzo-Indian (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4), Benoni, Grünfeld or Neo-Grünfeld. As White, Fischer <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> played 1.e4 {{throughout}} his career.|$|E
5|$|As the Confederation, {{from its}} {{foundation}} in 1291, was <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> composed of German-speaking regions, the earliest forms of literature are in German. In the 18th century, French became the fashionable language in Bern and elsewhere, while {{the influence of}} the French-speaking allies and subject lands was more marked than before.|$|E
5|$|Employed at Square Enix from 1998 to 2003, Eguchi is {{currently}} working for Sega, where he primarily assists Tomoya Ohtani on his projects. Eguchi created mostly electronic music {{in the early part}} of his career, but now <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> focuses on orchestral composition and arrangement, along with performing keyboards for various other musicians.|$|E
5|$|English {{word order}} {{has moved from}} the Germanic verb-second (V2) word order to being <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> subject–verb–object (SVO). The {{combination}} of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters {{of two or more}} verbs at the centre of the sentence, such as he had hoped to try to open it.|$|E
5|$|Mourning doves {{are light}} grey and brown and {{generally}} muted in color. Males and females {{are similar in}} appearance. The species is generally monogamous, with two squabs (young) per brood. Both parents incubate {{and care for the}} young. Mourning doves eat <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> seeds, but the young are fed crop milk by their parents.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the few}} notable {{differences}} between the chemistry of yttrium {{and that of the}} lanthanides is that yttrium is <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> trivalent, whereas about half the lanthanides can have valences other than three; nevertheless, only for four of the fifteen lanthanides are these other valences important in aqueous solution (CeIV, SmII, EuII, and YbII).|$|E
5|$|One {{possible}} source {{has been}} identified in the forests of New Guinea: beetles of the genus Choresine (family Melyridae), which contain the toxin and {{have been found in}} the stomachs of hooded pitohui. An alternative explanation, that the birds and beetles both get the toxin from a third source, is considered unlikely as the blue-capped ifrit is <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> insectivorous.|$|E
5|$|Self-harm (SH), {{also known}} as self-injury, {{is defined as the}} intentional, direct {{injuring}} of body tissue, done without suicidal intentions. These terms are used in the more recent literature in an attempt to reach a more neutral terminology. The older literature, especially that which predates the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> refers to self-mutilation.|$|E
5|$|The 1945 Allied {{conference in}} San Francisco {{established}} the multi-national United Nations (UN) {{for the maintenance}} of world peace, but the enforcement capacity of its Security Council was effectively paralyzed by individual members' ability to use veto power. Accordingly, the UN was essentially converted into an inactive forum for exchanging polemical rhetoric, and the Soviets regarded it <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> as a propaganda tribune.|$|E
5|$|The Caelifera {{includes}} some 2,400 valid genera and about 11,000 known species. Many undescribed species probably exist, especially in tropical wet forests. The Caelifera have a predominantly tropical distribution with fewer species known from temperate zones, {{but most of}} the superfamilies have representatives worldwide. They are <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> herbivorous and are probably the oldest living group of chewing herbivorous insects.|$|E
5|$|The Inner Court is {{separated}} from the Outer Court by an oblong courtyard lying orthogonal to the City's main axis. It was {{the home of the}} Emperor and his family. In the Qing dynasty, the Emperor lived and worked <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> in the Inner Court, with the Outer Court used only for ceremonial purposes.|$|E
5|$|The Peak District {{is formed}} <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> from {{sedimentary}} rocks {{dating from the}} Carboniferous period. They comprise the Carboniferous Limestone, the overlying Gritstone and the Coal Measures which occur only on the extreme margins of the area and infrequent outcrops of igneous rocks including lavas, tuffs and volcanic vent agglomerates.|$|E
5|$|The album Adios {{was written}} and {{performed}} <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> by Konietzko and Skold. Ogre again provided vocals, as did German musician Nina Hagen. Originally {{the fulfillment of}} the band's ten record contract with Wax Trax!/TVT, Adios later signaled {{the breakup of the}} band itself, which Esch's and Schulz's limited participation foreshadowed.|$|E
5|$|The whiskery shark is {{an active}} and highly {{specialized}} predator, feeding <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> on octopuses. Other cephalopods, bony fishes, small rock lobsters, spoon worms, and seagrass have also been found amongst its stomach contents. A known parasite of this species is the tapeworm Calliobothrium pritchardae.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 20thcentury, the Ouse {{was used}} by barges to carry freight between York and the port of Hull. The last {{significant}} traffic was the supply of newsprint to the local newspaper's Foss-side print works, which continued until 1997. Today navigation is <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> leisure-oriented.|$|E
5|$|A {{report in}} 1997 {{described}} use of sponges {{as a tool}} by bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay in Western Australia. A dolphin will attach a marine sponge to its rostrum, which is presumably then used to protect it when searching for food in the sandy sea bottom. The behavior, known as sponging, has only been observed in this bay, and is <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> shown by females. A study in 2005 concluded that mothers teach the behavior to their daughters, and that all the sponge-users are closely related, suggesting {{that it is a}} fairly recent innovation.|$|E
5|$|Adult dragonflies hunt on {{the wing}} using their {{exceptionally}} acute eyesight and strong, agile flight. They are <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> carnivorous, eating {{a wide variety of}} insects ranging from small midges and mosquitoes to butterflies, moths, damselflies, and smaller dragonflies. A large prey item is subdued by being bitten on the head and is carried by the legs to a perch. Here, the wings are discarded and the prey usually ingested head first. A dragonfly may consume as much as a fifth of its body weight in prey per day.|$|E
5|$|After being re-established in December 1940, I./JG 1's primary {{responsibility}} was the air defence of Germany and its Northern occupied territories. In this role, the unit <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> {{worked in the}} Netherlands prior to its transfer to central West Germany. Its main opponents through 1940–41 were therefore lone RAF reconnaissance aircraft, the anti-shipping aircraft of RAF Coastal Command and the medium bombers of RAF Bomber Command's 2 Group, although the group would see little action compared to other theaters during 1941. During this time, this sector was considered relatively safe compared to other theaters.|$|E
5|$|Although England {{have played}} home matches <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> at Twickenham since 1910, they have played at Huddersfield's Galpharm Stadium twice in 1998, at Old Trafford against New Zealand in 1997 and at Wembley Stadium against Canada in 1992. They also played {{the first of}} a two-test series against Argentina at Old Trafford in June 2009, a match {{originally}} scheduled to be held in Argentina but moved by the country's national federation for financial reasons.|$|E
5|$|Although a professional—captains at {{the time}} were <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> amateurs—the respect in which Hobbs was held meant that he was {{accepted}} as a captain. Many, but not all, critics considered him a competent tactician and leader. He regularly led the Players team against the Gentlemen and sometimes at Surrey in the absence of Percy Fender, but he was a reluctant captain. He disliked the responsibility and decision-making of leadership, and rarely even offered tactical advice.|$|E
5|$|Although {{juvenile}} {{and adult}} J.lagostoma are <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> terrestrial, the larvae are marine and planktonic. In order to release their offspring, the adults therefore have to {{migrate to the}} sea, as seen in other land crabs, such as the Christmas Island red crab, Gecarcoidea natalis. In {{most members of the}} family Gecarcinidae, migration coincides with the rainy season, which reduces the risk of desiccation; migration in J.lagostoma occurs from January until March, while the period of highest rainfall is from March to May.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this was}} a good start, Hastings was not a {{particularly}} well-known barrister, and cases were few and far between. To get around the lack of funds Hastings accepted a pupil, and for the next year Hastings lived <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> off the fees that the pupil paid him. To maintain the appearance of an active and busy chamber Hastings had his clerk borrow papers from other barristers and give them to the pupil to work on, claiming that they were cases of Hastings.|$|E
5|$|As {{elevation}} {{continues to}} increase, only the hardiest trees {{remain in the}} forest, which is composed <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> of balsam fir. Most of the understory plants and animals from the upper spruce-fir zone, however, {{can be found in}} this forest. Moisture causes nutrients to be stripped from the soil and brought to lower elevations, and decomposition takes place at a rate that is too slow to replenish them.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{sketches}} were derived <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> from the books, whose multimedia approach, consisting of short anecdotes interspersed with cartoons, diaries, newspaper articles and recipes, proved easily adaptable {{to the screen}} either as raw material or creative inspiration. In later series, as usable material from the books and other obvious sources began to run out, concepts were drawn from more standard historical texts under Jenner's supervision. He and fellow researchers read through many different studies and picked out suitably quirky, intriguing snippets, which were then pitched to the writers for development.|$|E
5|$|Before Stanton {{narrowed her}} {{political}} focus <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> to women's rights, {{she was an}} active abolitionist with her husband Henry Brewster Stanton (co-founder of the Republican Party) and cousin Gerrit Smith. Unlike many {{of those involved in}} the women's rights movement, Stanton addressed various issues pertaining to women beyond voting rights. Her concerns included women's parental and custody rights, property rights, employment and income rights, divorce, the economic health of the family, and birth control. She was also an outspoken supporter of the 19th-century temperance movement.|$|E
5|$|Below Colthrop Lock in Thatcham {{the river}} leaves behind the {{built-up}} area of Newbury and runs in generally rural surroundings. It {{passes through the}} Woolhampton Reed Bed, another SSSI which consists of dense reed bed with smaller areas of tall fen vegetation and carr woodland. It is notable for the diversity of insects it supports and its nesting passerine bird populations, which include several uncommon species such as reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus), a species that in Britain nests <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> in this habitat.|$|E
5|$|Beyoncé's {{music is}} {{generally}} R, {{but she also}} incorporates pop, soul and funk into her songs. 4 demonstrated Beyoncé's exploration of 1990s-style R, as well as further use of soul and hip hop than compared to previous releases. While she <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> releases English songs, Beyoncé recorded several Spanish songs for Irreemplazable (re-recordings of songs from B'Day for a Spanish-language audience), and the re-release of B'Day. To record these, Beyoncé was coached phonetically by American record producer Rudy Perez.|$|E
5|$|Blue whales feed <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> on krill, {{though they}} also take {{small numbers of}} copepods. The species of this {{zooplankton}} eaten by blue whales varies from ocean to ocean. In the North Atlantic, Meganyctiphanes norvegica, Thysanoessa raschii, Thysanoessa inermis and Thysanoessa longicaudata are the usual food; in the North Pacific, Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa inermis, Thysanoessa longipes, Thysanoessa spinifera, Nyctiphanes symplex and Nematoscelis megalops; and in the Southern Hemisphere, Euphausia superba, Euphausia crystallorophias, Euphausia valentini, and Nyctiphanes australis.|$|E
5|$|Cleaning {{symbiosis}} is {{a mutually}} beneficial association between individuals of two species, where one (the cleaner) removes and eats parasites {{and other materials}} {{from the surface of}} the other (the client). Cleaning symbiosis is well-known among marine fish, where some small species of cleaner fish, notably wrasses but also species in other genera, are specialised to feed <b>almost</b> <b>exclusively</b> by cleaning larger fish and other marine animals. Other cleaning symbioses exist between birds and mammals, and in other groups.|$|E
