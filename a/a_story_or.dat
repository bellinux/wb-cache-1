5|$|In all {{games from}} the second onwards, the player will gain access {{to a series of}} (predominantly 8-bit) minigames, {{sometimes}} randomly after death, as in the second game, and sometimes once the player has completed a specific task. These minigames usually tell <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>or</b> event relevant to the game's lore, although mostly presented in a cryptic way. For example, minigames in Five Nights at Freddy's 2 are speculated to portray the homicidal incidents previously mentioned in the games. Minigames in Five Nights at Freddy's 4 tell the story of a character, possibly the player character, who dies in a tragic accident.|$|E
5|$|Sung jwé, jwé chanté or chanté kont, {{is mostly}} {{part of the}} funeral wake tradition. A jwé chanté leader uses {{pantomime}} to enact scenes from <b>a</b> <b>story,</b> <b>or</b> sometimes just the ribald double entendres from it. The gém (game song) are based around a leader who uses his own flourishes on a choreographed dance and improvises witty lyrics, while the audience participates in the performance. Jwé dansé includes four traditional dances. The solo is a couple dance, and the débòt, yonbòt and jwé pòté are all circle dances. The blòtjé is a musical movement found in all jwé dansé styles, occurring, for example, every four beats in the débòt dance.|$|E
5|$|One {{proposed}} {{explanation for}} the existence of count-classifiers is that they serve more of a cognitive purpose than a practical one: in other words, they provide a linguistic way for speakers to organize or categorize real objects. An alternative account is that they serve more of a discursive and pragmatic function (a communicative function when people interact) rather than an abstract function within the mind. Specifically, it has been proposed that count-classifiers might be used to mark new or unfamiliar objects within a discourse, to introduce major characters or items in <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>or</b> conversation, or to foreground important information and objects by making them bigger and more salient. In this way, count-classifiers might not serve an abstract grammatical or cognitive function, but may help in communication by making important information more noticeable and drawing attention to it.|$|E

25|$|The narrative/identity account {{suggests}} that the reminiscence bump occurs because {{a sense of identity}} develops during adolescence and early adulthood. Research {{suggests that}} memories that have more influence and significance to one's self are more frequently rehearsed in defining one's identity, and are therefore better remembered later in life (Ece & Gulgoz, 2014). Identity formation provides added motivation for using cognitive processes to ensure recall of these memories. The events from this period {{are more likely to be}} organized into <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>or</b> view of oneself, and benefits from the advantage of schematic organization in memory.|$|E
25|$|The dalang gives a sign, {{the small}} gamelan {{orchestra}} with drummer {{and a few}} knobbed gongs and a musician with a rebab (violin-like instrument held vertically) begins to play and the dalang unrolls the first scroll of the story. Then, speaking and singing, he narrates the episode in more detail. In this manner, {{in the course of}} the evening he unrolls several scrolls one at a time. Each scene in the scrolls represents <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>or</b> part of a story. The content of the story typically stems from the Panji romances which are semi-historical legends set in the 12th-13th century East Javanese kingdoms of Jenggala, Daha and Kediri, and also in Bali.|$|E
25|$|A symphonic poem or tone poem is a {{piece of}} orchestral music in one {{movement}} in which some extramusical program provides a narrative or illustrative element. This program may come from a poem, <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>or</b> novel, a painting, or another source. The term was first applied by Liszt to his 13 one-movement orchestral works in this vein. They were not pure symphonic movements in the classical sense because they dealt with descriptive subjects taken from mythology, Romantic literature, recent history or imaginative fantasy. In other words, these works were programmatic rather than abstract. The form was a direct product of Romanticism which encouraged literary, pictorial and dramatic associations in music. It developed into an important form of programme music {{in the second half of}} the 19th century.|$|E

500|$|One common {{technique}} is to memorize <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>or</b> poem {{in which the}} word lengths represent the digits of : The first word has three letters, the second word has one, the third has four, the fourth has one, the fifth has five, and so on. An early example of a memorization aid, originally devised by English scientist James Jeans, is [...] "How I want a drink, alcoholic of course, after the heavy lectures involving quantum mechanics." [...] When a poem is used, it is {{sometimes referred to as}} a piem. Poems for memorizing [...] have been composed in several languages in addition to English. [...] Record-setting [...] memorizers typically do not rely on poems, but instead use methods such as remembering number patterns and the method of loci.|$|E
500|$|The stylistic device most {{commonly}} found in Wodehouse's work is his use of comparative imagery that includes similes. Hall opines that the humour comes from Wodehouse's ability to accentuate [...] "resemblances which at first glance seem highly incongruous". Examples {{can be seen in}} Joy in the Morning, Chapter 29: [...] "There was a sound in the background like a distant sheep coughing gently on a mountainside. Jeeves sailing into action", or Psmith, Chapter 7: [...] "A sound like two or three pigs feeding rather noisily {{in the middle of a}} thunderstorm interrupted his meditation." [...] Hall also identifies that periodically Wodehouse used the stylistic device of a transferred epithet, with an adjective that properly belongs to a person applied instead to some inanimate object. The form of expression is used sparingly by Wodehouse in comparison with other mechanisms, only once or twice in <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>or</b> novel, according to Hall.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from The Hindu noted, [...] "The film {{takes off}} as a typical family drama. The {{first half of the}} film is intentionally slow-paced and shows to the audience the lighter moments in the family of Georgekutty. This half combines the elements of drama and comedy genres. The audience gets completely absorbed in the twist of events that begin to unfold {{from the end of the}} first half. The second half is more like a thriller and is about how the family, despite the vengeful villainy of a corrupt cop, stands its ground even as the law takes its course." [...] When asked whether this change in narrative style post-interval was intentional, Jeethu replied: [...] "I really don't understand when people say the first half lacked pace. <b>A</b> <b>story</b> <b>or</b> a film has its own way of progression and it does travel in a zig-zag away, capturing all the ups and downs of our lives. Right from the start if you accelerate the pace, sooner or later, the story-telling will lose its steam." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{observance}} of April Fools' Day in 2006, Slashdot temporarily changed its signature teal color theme to a warm palette of bubblegum pink and changed its masthead from the usual, [...] "News for Nerds" [...] motto to, [...] "OMG!!! Ponies!!!" [...] Editors joked {{that this was}} done to increase female readership. In another supposed April Fools' Day joke, User Achievement tags were introduced on April 1, 2009. This system allowed users to be tagged with various achievements, such as [...] "The Tagger" [...] for tagging <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>or</b> [...] "Member of the {1,2,3,4,5} Digit UID Club" [...] for having a Slashdot UID consisting of {{a certain number of}} digits. While it was posted on April Fools' Day to allow for certain joke achievements, the system is real. Slashdot unveiled its newly redesigned site on June 4, 2006, following a CSS Redesign Competition. The winner of the competition was Alex Bendiken, who built on the initial CSS framework of the site. The new site looks similar to the old one but is more polished with more rounded curves, collapsible menus, and updated fonts. On November 9 that same year, Malda wrote that Slashdot attained 16,777,215 (or 224 − 1) comments, which broke the database for three hours until the administrators fixed the issue.|$|E
500|$|Coulton Waugh {{attempted}} {{the first}} comprehensive history of American comics with The Comics (1947). [...] Will Eisner's Comics and Sequential Art (1985) and Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics (1993) were early attempts in English to formalize the study of comics. [...] David Carrier's The Aesthetics of Comics (2000) was the first full-length treatment of comics from a philosophical perspective. [...] Prominent American attempts at definitions of comics include Eisner's, McCloud's, and Harvey's. [...] Eisner described what he called [...] "sequential art" [...] as [...] "the arrangement of pictures or images and words to narrate <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>or</b> dramatize an idea"; [...] Scott McCloud defined comics as [...] "juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information and/or to produce an aesthetic response in the viewer", a strictly formal definition which detached comics from its historical and cultural trappings. [...] R.C. Harvey defined comics as [...] "pictorial narratives or expositions in which words (often lettered into the picture area within speech balloons) usually contribute {{to the meaning of}} the pictures and vice versa". [...] Each definition has had its detractors. [...] Harvey saw McCloud's definition as excluding single-panel cartoons, [...] and objected to McCloud's de-emphasizing verbal elements, insisting [...] "the essential characteristic of comics is the incorporation of verbal content". [...] Aaron Meskin saw McCloud's theories as an artificial attempt to legitimize the place of comics in art history.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by a team that consisted of staff members from previous Tales entries, as well as developers from the company's Tekken and Soulcalibur fighting game series. Producer Jun Toyoda explained that {{the goal was to}} create a role-playing game with the [...] "exhilarating battle scenes" [...] found in those titles, and to appeal to players who either felt that fighting games lacked <b>a</b> <b>story</b> <b>or</b> felt that traditional role-playing game combat was too [...] "tedious". Although the game features three-dimensional characters, battle sequences were purposefully restricted to a two-dimensional plane to allow the developers to create large monsters without fear of them obstructing the player's view of the action. Character animation was handled by Yosuke Kadowaki, who had previously used the same motion-capture technology on Soulcalibur II. The scenario was written by Koki Matsumoto and Tsuyoshi Tanaka. The main story theme was [...] "bonds", with the main priority being the overlapping stories of the main cast. Unlike previous Tales games where character art and design was mostly done by Mutsumi Inomata, Tales of Legendia features characters designed by anime illustrator and animator Kazuto Nakazawa, known for his prior work on the animated sequences from the 2003 film , as well as animated features such as El-Hazard and [...] Tales of Legendia includes animated cutscenes produced by Japanese studio Production I.G., and contains more animation than any previous game in the series.|$|E
