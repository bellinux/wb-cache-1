5000|$|The {{polling station}} {{was held at}} the Murray Parade Ground. Some 3,368 men cast ballots, <b>about</b> <b>one-thirds</b> of the 9,700 {{registered}} electorates, lower than the expectation. The China Mail commented it as [...] "scarcely be regarded as a convincing sign that the Colony is desperately anxious to enjoy extended franchise." [...] Brook Bernacchi of the Reform Club of Hong Kong and William Louey of the Kowloon Residents' Association, chief manager of Kowloon Motor Bus, were elected out of nine candidates. Pro-Communist barrister Percy Chen was one of the candidates. He urged voters to treat the election as a referendum to press London for a further constitutional reform promised by Young. He ranked sixth of the nine candidates by getting 461 votes. The other Reform Club candidate Woo Pak-chuen lost the race by only 38 votes.|$|R

40|$|Background: Pegylated interferon-α {{has been}} shown to be more efficacious than {{conventional}} interferon in treating chronic hepatitis C. The use of peginterferon in chronic hepatitis B virus infection with positive hepatitis B e antigen has also been tested in a number of trials since 2003. Aim: To systematically summarize and compare the results of these studies. Methods: Four studies were identified from PubMed, Medline and reference lists. Data from the trials were extracted and analysed. Where appropriate, combined odds ratio of different trials was calculated. Safety data including serious adverse events and emergence of drug-resistant mutants were recorded. Results: Three of the four trials contained predominantly Asian patients. Peginterferon is found to be superior to lamivudine monotherapy and induced sustained biochemical and virological responses in <b>about</b> <b>one-thirds</b> of patients after 12 months of therapy. Coadministration of lamivudine did not result in improvement in viral suppression. Peginterferon appears to reduce the emergence of YMDD mutation in the combination treatment groups. It was well tolerated with serious adverse events reported i...|$|R

30|$|This study {{suggested}} that while many FMSs were conducting medical audits and providing feedback {{to their health}} clinics staff, {{less than half of}} the respondent perceived FMSs being involved in medical research and writing for publication. Every FMS who had graduated from any residency programs in Malaysia had in fact successfully conducted and completed a medical research. Abstracts of their studies might have been presented in scientific conferences. However, owing to the many duties and responsibilities of a public FMS, many might not be able to publish previous works or initiate new research projects (Weber-Main et al. 2013). It was reported that even in the United States only <b>about</b> <b>one-thirds</b> of all the abstracts presented in family medicine and primary care conferences were actually published (Post et al. 2013). Thus, FMSs would need to enhance personal motivation, professional skills in research collaboration with other FMSs or academic FMSs in research project, scientific writing and publication. They may require practical support such as protected time, incentives and rewards in conducting and publishing researches in order to increase their research expertise and visibility (Weber-Main et al. 2013).|$|R

40|$|Existing {{literature}} has investigated {{the characteristics of}} binational partnerships in {{a small number of}} European countries, such as Belgium and the Netherlands, but such research has not been replicated in the UK context. Understanding the prevalence and characteristics of binational partnerships is a critical policy issue in the UK context, as the country edges closer to a public referendum on its membership in the European Union. In the event of a so-called ‘Brexit’ the rights and responsibilities of non-UK, European nationals and their families could be significantly affected. Against this context, this paper draws on the 2011 Census for England and Wales in order to investigate the characteristics of non-UK European nationals resident in England and Wales. The preliminary findings show that just over four per cent of individuals living in England and Wales in 2011 are Europe-born nationals, equating to 2. 5 million people of whom 2. 26 million are aged 18 and over. Of these, almost two-thirds are employed; just over half are single never-married; and approximately half of them have at least one dependent child. <b>About</b> <b>one-thirds</b> of men and one-fifth of women in this group were partnered with a British-born individual. Such findings contribute {{to our understanding of the}} current situation of binational partnerships in the UK, which can in turn inform our understanding of their potential situation in the future if a ‘Brexit’ occurs...|$|R
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{academic}} stress {{and mental health}} of Indian {{high school students and}} the associations between various psychosocial factors and academic stress. A total of 190 students from grades 11 and 12 (mean age: 16. 72 years) from three government-aided and three private schools in Kolkata India were surveyed in the study. Data collection involved using a specially designed structured questionnaire as well as the General Health Questionnaire. Nearly two-thirds (63. 5 %) of the students reported stress due to academic pressure – with no significant differences across gender, age, grade, and several other personal factors. About two-thirds (66 %) of the students reported feeling pressure from their parents for better academic performance. The degree of parental pressure experienced differed significantly across the educational levels of the parents, mother’s occupation, number of private tutors, and academic performance. In particular, children of fathers possessing a lower education level (non-graduates) were found to be more likely to perceive pressure for better academic performance. <b>About</b> <b>one-thirds</b> (32. 6 %) of the students were symptomatic of psychiatric caseness and 81. 6 % reported examination-related anxiety. Academic stress was positively correlated with parental pressure and psychiatric problems, while examination-related anxiety also was positively related to psychiatric problems. Academic stress is a serious issue which affects nearly two thirds of senior high school students in Kolkata. Potential methods for combating the challenges of academic pressure are suggested...|$|R
