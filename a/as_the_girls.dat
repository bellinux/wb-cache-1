5|$|After {{a tour of}} the home, {{the girls}} leave the {{watermelon}} in a well to keep it cold. Mac later goes to retrieve the watermelon and does not return. When Fantasy goes to retrieve the watermelon from the well, she finds Mac's head, which flies in the air and bites Fantasy's buttocks before she escapes. The other girls also begin to encounter other supernatural traps throughout the house. The aunt disappears after entering the broken refrigerator, and the girls are attacked or possessed by a series of items in the house, such as Gorgeous becoming possessed after using her aunt's mirror and Sweet disappearing after being attacked by mattresses. These attacks cause the girls to try to escape the house. As soon as Gorgeous walks out the door, the rest of the girls find themselves locked in. The girls try to find the aunt to unlock the door but only find Mac's severed hand in a jar. Melody begins to play the piano to keep the girl's spirits up <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> hear Gorgeous singing upstairs. As Prof and Kung Fu go to investigate, Melody's fingers are bitten off by the piano, and it ultimately eats her whole.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{out in a}} {{black and}} white frame (and later {{incorporating}} scenes of color), a group of girls are seen standing outside on the street while Bieber is seen exiting a building while trying to walk away without getting noticed. This however, is unsuccessful <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> run up to Bieber; he then takes pictures and signs autographs with the girls. While this is happening Bieber takes an interest with one particular girl asking her to meet him later on, to which she agrees. As the song starts playing Bieber is seen sitting in an empty auditorium playing the piano and singing. When Bieber's date shows up they sneak into an empty theater where they are seen; holding hands, horsing around on the theater's seats, and sliding down banisters. At the ending of the video they are seen engaging in a playful back-alley water fight and eventually collapse into each other's arms while Bieber is playing the piano back inside the theater.|$|E
5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{was perceived}} as a signifier of social identity, with a popular subject for cartoons being that of maids wearing crinolines like their mistresses, much to the higher-class ladies' disapproval. The questions of servants in crinoline and the related social concerns were raised by George Routledge in an etiquette manual published in 1875, where he criticised London housemaids for wearing hoops at work. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> knelt to scrub the doorsteps, Routledge described how their hoops rose to expose their lower bodies, inspiring street harassment from errand boys and other male passers-by. Routledge firmly opined that servants ought to save their fashionable garments for their leisure periods, and dress appropriately for their work. However, this was challenged by some servants who saw attempts to control their dress as equivalent to controlling their liberty, and refused to work for employers who tried to forbid crinolines.|$|E

5|$|The second chorus has {{the girls}} {{dancing on the}} table, {{knocking}} several pieces of food and tuppleware onto the ground. A-Chan is seen lying down on a pillow, whilst Kashiyuka balances a book and an apple on her head. Both of these scenes have them throwing several pieces of food onto the table. Nocchi is seen at the dining table, holding a fork and listen to music through her headphones. She witnesses a small door underneath a stool, opens it, and sees a small green room. In the room, a blurred image of a cup starts to become clear, and holds small candy. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> eat the pieces of candy, their cream-coloured dresses turn into the outfits from the cover sleeve from the single. The girls start dancing in the fish bowl, surrounded by glittery lights. The final scene has the girls looking through the small door again, only to witness {{the dining room table}} empty; the small cup with candy appears in beige colouring rather than full-on vibrancy.|$|E

Her sister was five years younger, and by the time Marie reached high school, the school had basketball teams for girls. The experience was exasperating in some ways, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> did not take it seriously, but VanDerveer realized coaching was something she loved.|$|E
25|$|Facing {{financial}} ruin {{with the}} tour promoters threatening to sue him, Oakey {{had less than}} a week to put a new band together. In an unplanned move Oakey went to a Sheffield city centre discoth√®que called The Crazy Daisy (since demolished) and recruited two totally unknown teenage girls he saw dancing there: Susan Ann Sulley and Joanne Catherall into the band. As luck would have it, they were already fans of The Human League and recognised Oakey. He now calls this the best decision of his career, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> would be critical in the band's further success, and Sulley and Catherall are now Oakey's business partners in the present day band.|$|E

25|$|Pamela Jelimo {{was born}} in Kiptamok village, Nandi District, Rift Valley Province. Her mother, Esther Cheptoo Keter, was a {{promising}} 200 metres and 400 metres runner, but the customs of the Nandi tribe meant that as the last-born daughter she could not marry and had {{to care for her}} parents in their old age. However, she was allowed to bear children to different men; thus, Jelimo was raised by her mother in a family of three brothers and six sisters. Jelimo began running in 2003, aged 13, at Koyo Secondary in the Kaptumo division, near Kapsabet. She quickly established herself as an accomplished athlete, winning at schools' championships in the 100 metres, 200m, 400m, 800 metres, 400 metres hurdles and heptathlon. Her high school games teacher Philip Ng'eno remarked that she used to compete with the boys in sprint events <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> did not provide the competition she needed.|$|E
25|$|Hensel {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} a study with 387 female participants {{between the ages of}} 14 and 17 and found that <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> got older (and learned more about their sexual self-concept), they experienced less anxiety, greater comfort with sexuality and experienced more instances of sexual activity. Additionally, across the four years (from 14-17), sexual self-esteem increased, and sexual anxiety lessened. The researchers stated that this may indicate that the more sexual experiences the adolescent girls have had, the more confidence they hold in their sexual behavior and sexuality. Additionally, it may mean that for girls who have not yet had intercourse, they become more confident and ready to participate in an encounter for the first time. Researchers state that these patterns indicate that adolescent sexual behavior is not at all sporadic and impulsive, rather that it is strongly affected by the adolescent girls‚Äô sexual self-concept and changes and expands through time.|$|E

A writer of The Times of India found a break-up theme in the song, further saying that [...] "In 'Girl', the relational mishaps play out as three-way girl talk, with two girlfriends trying to help their sister see the truth of a bad connection". It opens with Beyonc√© singing the lines [...] "Take a minute girl, come sit down/ And tell us what's been happening/ In your face I can see the pain/ Don't try and convince us you're happy." ...|$|E
500|$|Between 1956 and 1958, Keller hired La Monte Montyne {{to paint}} murals {{throughout}} the club's interior. The fluorescent murals depict scenes which Roy thought patrons would appreciate.

The mural at the Pyramids depicts a lounging Cleopatraesque woman, and another features an [...] "exotic priestess" [...] making a sacrifice at a volcano. According to Mary's, the murals receive [...] "almost as much attention <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> do!" [...] Mary's [...] "retro" [...] neon marquee has been called a [...] "landmark for locals and tourists alike". In 2014, a Willamette Week contributor said about the signage: [...] "The marquee, blue and star-spangled and coyly advertising an evening of 'Dine and Dance', is as iconic as the neon on the 'Made in Oregon' sign and the line outside Voodoo". The club's cocktail-waitress logo is featured on clothing, and its marquee also includes an epitaph to Keller.|$|E

[...] "Girls in Their Summer Clothes" [...] has been cited as a {{singularly}} [...] "breezy" [...] song on the album, though A. O.
