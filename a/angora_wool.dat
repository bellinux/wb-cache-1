50|$|In the 1850s, Australia's first payable {{gold mine}} (the Victoria) {{was located in}} the area. The area was also home to Price Maurice, who moved to Castambul in 1856 and bred <b>Angora</b> goats for <b>wool.</b> <b>Angora</b> goats were {{introduced}} from Turkey to South Australia by John Haigh, who bred them near Port Lincoln. After purchasing Haigh's flock, Maurice was impressed with their potential and soon sent to Turkey for additional animals. His enterprises in South Australia were very successful but he returned to Britain {{with his family in}} 1862 for health reasons.|$|R
5000|$|The Satin Angora {{is derived}} from cross {{breeding}} between a Satin and a French Angora. This breed is named for the high sheen of the wool, {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "satinized", the hair shaft has a semi-transparent outer shell and reflects light, resulting in deep color, high luster, and extreme soft texture of its wool. It resembles the French Angora, having no furnishings on the face, ears, or feet, and it is also easy to groom compared to the English variety, although the soft texture makes matting an issue, and daily combing is recommended. Satin <b>Angora's</b> <b>wool</b> is said to be stronger for spinning than other varieties of Angora, although it is considered more difficult to spin as it is more slippery.They are shown at ARBA shows using the types [...] "white" [...] and [...] "colored" [...] (broken not yet approved). As with other ARBA shown rabbits, toenails should also be only one color. The color of a Satin Angora is determined by the color of its head, feet, and tail (all the same color).|$|R

50|$|Ed Wood, {{a filmmaker}} {{known for his}} love of <b>Angora</b> <b>wool,</b> {{to the extent of}} wearing it and {{featuring}} it prominently in his own films.|$|E
50|$|The {{apparent}} fetish of Lobo with <b>angora</b> <b>wool</b> is {{a reflection}} of Wood's own fetish for the material. This also serves as the film's connection to Glen or Glenda (1953), where the fetish plays a more prominent role.|$|E
50|$|Rabbits {{such as the}} Angora, American Fuzzy Lop, and Jersey Wooly produce wool. However, {{since the}} American Fuzzy Lop and Jersey Wooly are both dwarf breeds, only the much larger Angora breeds such as the English Angora, Satin Angora, Giant Angora, and French Angoras are used for {{commercial}} wool production. Their long fur is sheared, combed, or plucked (gently pulling loose hairs from the body during molting) and then spun into yarn {{used to make a}} variety of products. Angora sweaters can be purchased in many clothing stores and is generally mixed with other types of wool. In 2010, 70% of <b>Angora</b> rabbit <b>wool</b> was produced in China. Rabbit <b>wool,</b> called <b>Angora,</b> is 5 times warmer than sheep's wool.|$|R
50|$|In May 1933 it was {{announced}} that the Canadian Handicrafts Guild had received letters of support from leaders and organizations across the country for their planned exhibition in Montreal for the end of October. It was planned to bring Quebec handicraft workers from their farms to Montreal to demonstrate their work. Some would be seeing the city for the first time.Participating organization included the Guild's branches in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island, the Art Association of Montreal, the Women's Art Society, Montreal, and Union Catholique des Cultivateurs, the Handicrafts Association of Canada of Toronto and the Mount Allison Handicrafts Guild of Sackville, New Brunswick.Products exhibited would include homespuns, tweed from a blend of <b>angora</b> and sheep's <b>wool,</b> Indian basketwork, hooked rugs, quilt, blankets and furniture.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{the largest}} of the four ARBA {{recognized}} Angora breeds. The only color the ARBA currently officially recognizes for Giant Angora is ruby-eyed white (REW), or as more commonly referred to as an [...] "albino", indicating the absence of color pigment in the genetic makeup. The Giant <b>Angora</b> produces more <b>wool</b> than the French, Satin or English Angora. It is easiest to set the rabbit on a standard grooming table, with a [...] "turn table" [...] to do the clipping, or you can pluck the loose fur they are shedding. The Giant Angora Buck in this picture is on a turn table, about to have his summer clipping, (18 oz) You then stay in control of where the rabbit is. Like the German Angora, they require their wool to be harvested every 90 days. When Giants are on a good feeding program, their wool will grow about 3 cm or 1 inch per month. The coat needs to be monitored after 6 months of growth as it may tend to [...] "die" [...] and easily mat. 12+ ounces of wool is not uncommon per clipping of a good-sized Giant Angora.|$|R
50|$|The term mohair is {{sometimes}} {{used to describe}} a type of material used for the folding roof on convertible cars. In this instance, mohair refers {{to a form of}} denim-like canvas. Mohair {{should not be confused with}} the fur from the angora rabbit, which is called <b>angora</b> <b>wool.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Nov. 2013, PETA {{released}} {{a video of}} a live angora rabbit in northeastern China having its fur torn off. The video received 200,000 views on China's video site Youku within a month and prompted UK retailers like Primark and Topshop to stop imports from China of products using <b>angora</b> <b>wool.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2013 several {{clothing}} retailers {{suspended the}} sourcing of products containing <b>angora</b> <b>wool</b> after video evidence surfaced of live rabbits with their paws tied being plucked raw in Chinese fur farms. Major retailers that banned angora products {{in response to}} welfare concerns include Gap Inc., Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, H&M and Esprit.|$|E
40|$|Current small stock tick control {{practices}} and producer attitudes towards tick {{control in the}} eastern Cape Province of South Africa are discussed. These were ascertained from returns to a questionnaire survey to which 31, 2 % of farmers polled, responded. In general, producers did not favour an intensive tick control policy for small stock. <b>Angora,</b> mutton and <b>wool</b> farmers had a definite preference for synthetic pyrethroid acaricides, the majority treating either less than 6 times p. a. or between 11 - 15 times p. a. Most producers changed acaricides because of price. All small stock producers favoured plunge dip application of acaricides {{while the majority of}} <b>wool</b> sheep and <b>Angora</b> producers utilized footbath application as a second preference. Mutton producers favoured pour-on and hand spray application as a second choice. Producers who used plunge dip application techniques experienced the highest percentage of confirmed acaricide resistance which is in accordance with application preference. The general incidence of confirmed acaricide resistance, however, was of a low order but highest amongst mutton farmers. An average cost for acaricide treatment of R 1, 65 per small stock unit p. a. was calculated from data gained in this survey. Only a small number of producers used the available heartwater vaccine. Small stock mortalities experienced by producers per production unit indicated higher mortalities at high acaricidal treatment frequencies. Farmers allowing a small number of ticks to infest their sheep experienced fewer mortalities due to heartwater than those than kept their sheep free of ticks. Angora goat farmers experienced the same, but with higher mortalities, probably due to the apparently high susceptibility of Angora goats to heartwater.

50|$|The {{city has}} {{exported}} mohair (from the Angora goat) and <b>Angora</b> <b>wool</b> (from the Angora rabbit) internationally for centuries. In the 19th century, {{the city also}} exported substantial amounts of goat and cat skins, gum, wax, honey, berries, and madder root. It was connected to Istanbul by railway before the First World War, continuing to export mohair, wool, berries, and grain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Angora</b> <b>wool</b> or Angora fiber {{refers to}} the down coat {{produced}} by the Angora rabbit. There are many types of Angora rabbits - English, French, German and Giant. Angora is prized for its softness, thin fibers of around 12-16 micrometers for quality fiber, and what knitters refer to as a halo (fluffiness). The fiber felts very easily. Angora fiber comes in white, black, and various shades of brown.|$|E
5000|$|Animal fibers {{are natural}} fibers that consist largely of {{particular}} proteins. Instances are silk, hair/fur (including wool) and feathers. The animal fibers used most commonly {{both in the}} manufacturing world {{as well as by}} the hand spinners are wool from domestic sheep and silk. Also very popular are alpaca fiber and mohair from Angora goats. Unusual fibers such as <b>Angora</b> <b>wool</b> from rabbits and Chiengora from dogs also exist, but are rarely used for mass production.|$|E
5000|$|The Angora rabbit (Ankara tavşanı) is {{a variety}} of {{domestic}} rabbit bred for its long, soft hair. The Angora {{is one of the}} oldest types of domestic rabbit, originating in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia, along with the Angora cat and Angora goat. The rabbits were popular pets with French royalty in the mid-18th century, and spread to other parts of Europe by the end of the century. They first appeared in the United States in the early 20th century. They are bred largely for their long <b>Angora</b> <b>wool,</b> which may be removed by shearing, combing, or plucking (gently pulling loose wool.) ...|$|E
50|$|Ankara was Atatürk's {{headquarters}} from 1920 and {{has been}} {{the capital of the}} Republic since the latter's founding in 1923, replacing Istanbul (once the Byzantine capital Constantinople) following the fall of the Ottoman Empire. The government is a prominent employer, but Ankara is also an important commercial and industrial city, located at the center of Turkey's road and railway networks. The city gave its name to the <b>Angora</b> <b>wool</b> shorn from Angora rabbits, the long-haired Angora goat (the source of mohair), and the Angora cat. The area is also known for its pears, honey and muscat grapes. Although situated in one of the driest places of Turkey and surrounded mostly by steppe vegetation except for the forested areas on the southern periphery, Ankara can be considered a green city in terms of green areas per inhabitant, at 72 m2 per head.|$|E
50|$|The Angora rabbit (Ankara tavşanı) is {{a variety}} of {{domestic}} rabbit bred for its long, soft wool. The Angora {{is one of the}} oldest types of domestic rabbit, originating in Ankara (historically known as Angora), present day Turkey, along with the Angora cat and Angora goat. The rabbits were popular pets with French royalty in the mid-18th century, and spread to other parts of Europe by the end of the century. They first appeared in the United States in the early 20th century. They are bred largely for their long <b>Angora</b> <b>wool,</b> which may be removed by shearing, combing, or plucking. There are many individual breeds of Angora rabbits, four of which are recognized by American Rabbit Breeders' Association (ARBA); they are English, French, Giant, and Satin. Other breeds include German, Chinese, Swiss, Finnish, Korean, and St. Lucian.|$|E
5000|$|The smock {{was made}} from loose-fitting, yellowish-sand coloured, heavyweight twill material, {{allegedly}} hand-painted with broad, mop like brushes using non-colourfast dyes in broad pea green and dark brown stripes, or [...] "brush-strokes". With use the base colour faded to a sandy buff, and the overlaid shades gained a blended appearance. The colours of the 1st pattern smock were thought to best suit the wearer to the North African and Italian theatres. It had a half length zip fastener made of steel, knitted woollen cuffs, four external pockets that secured with brass snaps (two on the chest and two below the waist), two internal pockets on the chest, and epaulettes that secured with plastic battle dress buttons. The inside of the collar was lined with soft khaki flannel (or in senior officer's smocks, <b>Angora</b> <b>wool).</b> A “beaver tail” fastened beneath the crotch from the {{back to the front}} of the smock - which kept it from riding up during a parachute descent. When not used, the tail would hang down behind the wearer's knees, hence the nickname [...] "men with tails", given by the Arabs in North Africa in 1942. The smock was styled as a very loose garment, since it would be worn over Battle Dress, but it could be adjusted to some extent with tightening tabs on both sides of the lower part of the smock.|$|E

40|$|Rabbits {{must surely}} {{be one of}} the most under-exploited sources of meat amongst the poorer groups of people living in the Tropics. The ability of rabbits to convert {{otherwise}} inedible vegetation into high quality food fit for human consumption is well-known throughout the world, yet relatively few people keep them in developing countries But the picture is changing as the importance of self-reliance is more widely appreciated. To accelerate this change the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) has produced a new compendium on rabbit production. This practical handbook explains in simple terms how to select suitable breeds, how to house, rear and feed rabbits and how to cope with the problems that may arise, such' es disease. The economic aspects of keeping rate bits are explained and there are accounts of the importance of by-products, such as rabbit skins and <b>angora</b> <b>wool,</b> which can support local industries and give the rabbit farmer an additional cash income. Rabbits grow quickly, reproduce quickly, require little space, do not produce an unpleasant odour, do not compete with man for food and will eat a wide range of foodplants; their meat is widely acceptable, easily digestible and generally commands a good price. If this book encourages more people to keep them, then it will have provided a valuable service to both rural and urban deve lopment. 'A Compendium of Rabbit Production' by W. Schlolaut et al.
