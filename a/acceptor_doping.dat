The greater the positive charge placed on the gate, the more positive the applied gate voltage, and the more holes that leave the semiconductor surface, enlarging the depletion region.

40|$|Langatate (LGT) is a {{piezoelectric}} oxide used in {{the high}} temperature region. As opposed to α-quartz, {{which is the most}} used piezoelectric today, langatate preserves its piezoelectric properties at temperatures up to 1470 °C. The defect chemistry of langatate has, however, not been fully understood. In this thesis, this will be addressed through AC impedance spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The defect chemistry and conductivity of nominally undoped and <b>acceptor</b> <b>doped</b> polycrystalline langatate, as well as single crystals, has been studied through impedance spectroscopy in the temperature range from 400 up to 1200 °C in oxygen partial pressure of 1 to 10 - 5 atm, as well as water vapour partial pressure of approximately 10 - 2 to 10 - 5 atm. Measurements have shown that the nominally undoped langatate was effectively donor doped and was compensated by oxygen interstitial and probably some cation vacancy. This sample showed no significant effect of either pO 2 or pH 2 O on the conductivity at temperatures up to 1200 °C, and did not show any sign of degradation in oxidizing or inert conditions, making it ideal for use as a piezoelectric in varying atmospheric conditions. The major charge carrier is interstitial oxygen and its enthalpy of mobility was calculated to 89 ± 4 kJ/mol. In the nominally 2. 5 mol% gallium doped polycrystalline langatate the major charge compensating defect was oxygen vacancies. These defects dominate the conductivity in dry conditions at low pO 2 at temperatures up to at least 1000 °C. In wet conditions at temperatures below 700 °C the major charge carrier was protons with enthalpy of mobility of 70 ± 0. 5 kJ/mol. From DFT calculations using GGA-PBE exchange-correlation potential a favourable hydration enthalpy of - 90 kJ/mol was obtained. DFT results showed that hydration involves vacancies and protons near the gallium ions, which might indicate that increasing the gallium content, might be favourable to the protonation of the material. At higher temperatures and high pO 2 there are significant contributions from electron holes. This composition of langatate could be ideal for use as a humidity sensor at temperatures up to 700 °C. The Z-cut and X-cut single crystalline langatate showed similar behaviour as the <b>acceptor</b> <b>doped</b> polycrystalline langatate, i. e. it must be effectively <b>acceptor</b> <b>doped</b> with gallium excess.

The rho-T characteristics of nonstoichiometric CaMnO 3 -delta is strongly influenced by oxygen deficiency, which controls the concentration of Mn 3 + ions and, in turn, affects the resistivity, rho. The results indicated that the substitution of aliovalent impurities at Ca-site in CaMnO 3 has similar effects as of CaMnO 3 -delta (undoped) annealed in atmospheres of varying partial pressures whereby electron or hole concentration can be altered, yet the doped samples can be processed in air or atmospheres of higher P-O 2.

40|$|Semiconductors {{represent}} the enabling technology that underpins the many advances that define modern society. One semiconductor that shows considerable promise in the fabrication of new devices is zinc oxide (ZnO). A fundamental {{understanding of the}} properties of a material is {{required in order to}} exploit its properties. The behaviour of dopants and defects relevant to optoelectronic device fabrication is of particular interest. However, <b>acceptor</b> <b>doping</b> of ZnO is currently controversial, as successful and reproducible <b>acceptor</b> <b>doping</b> has not yet been achieved. <b>Acceptor</b> <b>doping</b> of ZnO using silver (Ag) is explored in this thesis to contribute towards the understanding of defect introduction in ZnO. In addition, there is also increasing interest in exploring materials with unconventional properties, commonly referred to as metamaterials, particularly for optical applications. The previously unexplored unique combination of Ag and ZnO may enable the fabrication of those devices. Several key factors that affect heteroepitaxy film quality, and ultimately its properties, are buffer layers and substrate temperature. A lattice match between sapphire and ZnO was provided by using buffer layers of 1 nm magnesium oxide (MgO) and 7. 9 nm low temperature ZnO. The highest quality film was grown at the highest temperature (800 °C), with rms roughness of 2. 9 nm, carrier concentration of 3. 6 x 10 ¹⁶ cm⁻³, and mobility of 105 cm²/Vs. In contrast, dopant (Ag) incorporation occurs more readily below 600 °C, with dopant incorporation of up to 1020 cm⁻³ measured. Ag manifests as a deep acceptor (up to 94 % substitutionally on Zn lattice sites), as evident from decreasing carrier concentration with increasing Ag flux, and DLTS measurements indicating an acceptor trap at 319 meV. This suggests that Ag is suitable for introducing compensation in ZnO, but Ag acceptors are not sufficiently shallow to result in p-type material. However, the unique combination of ZnO and Ag also enables the fabrication of a novel device, namely a superlens.

The alloy which incorporate significant amount of Ni in the oxide showed a marked reduction in the oxidation rate in Ar/H- 2 /H 2 O These anomalies are explained by assuming that the oxidation mechanism is changed from grain boundary diffusion to volume diffusion in Ar/H- 2 /H 2 O and therefore doping effect and proton incorporation controls the later part of oxidation.

40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} {{experiments}} on radiative recombination of two-dimensional electrons in <b>acceptor</b> <b>doped</b> GaAs-AlGaAs heterojunctions {{as well as}} the success of a harmonic solid model in describing tunneling between two-dimensional electron systems, we calculate within the harmonic approximation and the time dependent perturbation theory the line shape of the photoluminescence spectrum corresponding to the recombination of an electron with a hole bound to an acceptor atom. The recombination process is modeled as a sudden perturbation of the Hamiltonian for the in-plane degrees of freedom of the electron. We include in the perturbation, in addition to changes in the equilibrium positions of electrons, changes in the curvatures of the harmonically approximated potential. The computed spectra have line shapes similar to that seen in a recent experiment. The spectral width, however, is roughly a factor of 3 smaller than that seen in experiment if one assumes a perfect Wigner crystal for the initial state state of the system, whereas a simple random disorder model yields a width a factor of 3 too large. We speculate on the possible mechanisms that may lead to better quantitative agreement with experiment. Comment: 22 pages, RevTex, 8 figures. Submitted to the Physical Review...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes to}} study {{the impact of a}} {{moderate}} variation of the channel doping level on the electrical performance of p-type Schottky-barrier (SB) MOSFETs. First, it has been found that a moderate increase of the <b>acceptors</b> <b>doping</b> level leads to a reduction of the Schottky-barrier height (SBH) but does not affect the silicide reaction. In the case of PtSi, the SBH on p-type silicon at 5 x 10 (15) cm(- 3) is 0. 15 eV whereas an increase of the doping level by two decades decreases the barrier by 60 meV. The integration of PtSi MOSFETs on moderately doped channel (5 x 10 (17) cm(- 3)) Was successfully achieved, demonstrating an overall 60 % improvement in current drive at L-g = 100 nm. This enhanced performance is attributed to the barrier height reduction related to the beneficial band bending induced by p-type dopants. The considered doping levels are still in a sufficiently low range not to affect the carrier mobility in the channel. A complete study, including comparison of I-on, I-off, immunity against short channel effects (Swing and DIBL), is presented. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
