40|$|The full {{functional}} {{length range}} of trachealis muscle was measured {{to identify a}} precise reference length and to assess the length changes that the myofilament lattice can accommodate. The initial reference length (L 10 %) was that where rest tension equaled 10 % of total force (passive tension plus active force). Total force <b>at</b> this <b>length</b> served as a force reference (Fref 219 12 kPa, N 7). Muscles initially adapted at L 10 % for 30 – 60 min had no rest tension when shortened to 0. 9 L 10 %. Passive tension rose steeply and linearly with slope 11. 2 Fref/L 10 % <b>at</b> <b>lengths</b> 1. 04 L 10 %. Rest tension at 1. 1 L 10 % declined by 10 % over 1 h.

40|$|Using density-functional theory the {{stability}} of armchair and zigzag single-walled carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons was investigated.
