5|$|Walter's chief {{administrative}} measures were his {{instructions to the}} itinerant justices of 1194 and 1198, his ordinance of 1195, an attempt to increase order in the kingdom, and his plan of 1198 {{for the assessment of}} a land tax. In 1194 the justices were ordered to secure the election of four coroners by each county court. The coroners were to keep, or register, royal pleas, which had previously been a duty of the sheriff. The juries were to be chosen by a committee of four knights, also elected by the county court. This introduction of coroners and constables eventually led to a change in the role of sheriffs, and a lessening of their importance in royal administration. Although he probably did not take part in the decision to set up a special exchequer for the collection of Richard's ransom, Walter did appoint the two escheators, or guardians of the amounts due, who were Hugh Bardulf in the north of England and William of Sainte-Mère-Eglise in the south. His instructions for the eyre, or circuits of traveling justices, <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>that</b> survive in English history. It was during his tenure of the justiciarship that the judicial role of the Exchequer became separated from the purely financial aspects.|$|E
25|$|As 7 {{is not a}} Fermat prime, the 7th {{roots of}} unity <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>that</b> require cube roots. There are six {{primitive}} 7th roots of unity; thus their computation involves solving a cubic polynomial, and therefore computing a cube root. The three real parts of these primitive roots are the roots of a cubic polynomial; thus they may be {{expressed in terms of}} square and cube roots. However, as these three roots are real, we are in the case of casus irreducibilis, and any expression of these real parts in terms of radicals involves necessarily some nonreal complex number.|$|E

6000|$|Glogau, as we saw, {{means to}} defend itself; at least, General Wallis the Commandant, does, {{in spite of}} the Glogau public; and is, with his whole might, digging, palisading, getting in meal, salt meat and other provender;--likewise burning suburbs, {{uncontrollable}} he, in the small place; and clearing down the outside edifices and shelters, at a diligent rate. Yesterday, 15th December, he burnt down the [...] "three Oder-Mills, which lie outside the big suburban Tavern, also the ZIEGEL-SCHEUNE (Tile-Manufactory)," [...] and other valuable buildings, careless of public lamentation,--fire catching the Town itself, and needing to be quenched again. [Helden-Geschichte, i. 473-475.] Nay, he was clear for burning down, or blowing up, the Protestant Church, indispensable sacred edifice which stands outside the walls: [...] "Prussians will make a block-house of it!" [...] said Wallis. A chief Protestant, Baron von Something, begged passionately for only twelve hours of respite,--to lay the case before his Prussian Majesty. Respite conceded, he and another chief Protestant had posted off accordingly; and did the next morning (Friday, 16th), short way from Crossen, meet his Majesty's carriage; who graciously pulled up for a few instants, and listened to their story. [...] "MEINE HERREN, you <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>that</b> ask a favor of me on Silesian ground; it shall be done you!" [...] said the King; and straightway despatched, in polite style, his written request to Wallis, engaging to make no military use whatever of said Church, [...] "but to attack by the other side, if attack were necessary." [...] Thus his Majesty saved the Church of Glogau; which of course was a popular act. Getting to see this Church himself a few days hence, he said, [...] "Why, it must come down at any rate, and be rebuilt; so ugly a thing!" ...|$|E
60|$|I think a {{good deal}} {{may be said to}} extenuate the fault of bad poets. What we call a genius, is hard to be {{distinguished}} by a man himself from a strong inclination: and if his genius be ever so great, he cannot at first discover it any other way than by giving way to that prevalent propensity which renders him the more liable to be mistaken. The only method he has is to make the experiment by writing, and appealing to the judgment of others: now if he happens to write ill (which is certainly no sin in itself) he is immediately made an object of ridicule. I wish we had the humanity to reflect, that even the worst authors might, in their endeavour to please us, deserve something at our hands. We have no cause to quarrel with them but for their obstinacy in persisting to write; and this too may admit of alleviating circumstances. Their particular friends may be either ignorant or insincere; {{and the rest of the}} world in general is too well bred to shock them with a truth which generally their booksellers <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>that</b> inform them of. This happens not till they have spent too much of their time to apply to any profession which might better fit their talents, and till such talents as they have are so far discredited as to be but of small service to them. For (what is the hardest case imaginable) the reputation of a man generally depends upon the first steps he makes in the world; and people will establish their opinion of us from what we do at that season when we have least judgment to direct us.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will bear}} me witness," [...] {{he said in}} his softest accents, [...] "that I am no party to sparing your life. If it rested with me you would die as these other men are about to do. I have no {{personal}} grudge against either you or them, but I have devoted my life to the destruction of the white race, and you <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>that</b> has ever been in my power and has escaped me. You may thank that stone of yours for your life. These poor fellows reverence it, and indeed if it really be what they think it is they have cause. Should it prove when we get ashore that they are mistaken, and that its shape and material is a mere chance, nothing can save your life. In the meantime we wish to treat you well, so if there are any of your possessions which you would like to take with you, you are at liberty to get them." [...] As he finished he gave a sign, and a couple of the negroes unbound me, though without removing the gag. I was led down into the cabin, where I put a few valuables into my pockets, together with a pocket-compass and my journal of the voyage. They then pushed me over the side into a small canoe, which was lying beside the large one, and my guards followed me, and shoving off began paddling for the shore. We had got about a hundred yards or so from the ship when our steersman held up his hand, and the paddlers paused for a moment and listened. Then on the silence of the night I heard a sort of dull, moaning sound, followed by a succession of splashes in the water. That is all I know of the fate of my poor shipmates. Almost immediately afterwards the large canoe followed us, and the deserted ship was left drifting about--a dreary, spectre-like hulk. Nothing was taken from her by the savages. The whole fiendish transaction was carried through as decorously and temperately {{as though it were a}} religious rite.|$|E

5000|$|... "The Art of Letting Go" [...] was {{originally}} Carey's formerly-named fourteenth studio album, which {{was scheduled to}} be release during the spring of 2014, as well as it second single of the same name, following statements that she wasn't ready to release the album in 2013 since she didn't want to [...] "exclude meaningful songs", as well as an injury on her shoulder while recording the music video for the remix of [...] "#Beautiful", which led her to spend some time recovering. On October 28, 2013, Carey uploaded the single artwork on her Instagram, also revealing that the song was going to premiere first on Facebook. The revealed artwork shows Carey kneeling down on a beach in front of a sunset. Sam Lanksy on Idolator commanded the sexiness of Carey's emancipated body, commenting: ..."

The decision to release it on the social networking was done by Carey's longtime collaborator, friend, and then-new manager, Jermaine Dupri. According to Dupri, [...] "Most artists upload their music to Facebook using SoundCloud, YouTube and Vevo, but we <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>that</b> are giving the music through the Facebook player." [...] He claimed that the release was not to be considered [...] "a ploy against traditional distribution routes", but [...] "an exercise to do something that none of those other outlets can do, basically." [...] He also explained that many fans of the singer are old school and that they [...] "need to be exposed to the song on radio first to want to support her, so while the Facebook premiere will attract a lot of die hard fans, many more fans will only be exposed to Mariah by airplay and that is what will drive up her iTunes position." ...|$|E
