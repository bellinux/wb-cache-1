The Swansea based artist Alexander Beleschenko designed and created the circular and domed Heart of Wales for {{the centre of the}} Siambr.

It has five parallel rows of 32 glass plates and was designed to have the practical use of protecting the public from high winds coming off Cardiff Bay. Devon born sculptor Richard Harris created The Meeting Place on the Plinth, which is 45 tonnes of slate machine-cut into 39 slate slabs; the slate was from Cwt y Bugail Quarry in north Wales. It is an informal seating area south of the building.

40|$|The {{existing}} molecular relaxation models {{based on}} both parallel relaxation theory and series relaxation theory cannot extract {{the contributions of}} gas compositions to <b>acoustic</b> relaxation <b>absorption</b> in mixtures. In this paper, we propose an analytical model to predict <b>acoustic</b> relaxation <b>absorption</b> and clarify composition relaxation contributions based on the rate-determining energy transfer processes in molecular relaxation in excitable gases. By combining parallel and series relaxation theory, the proposed model suggests that the vibration-translation process of the lowest vibrational mode in each composition provides the primary deexcitation path of the relaxation energy, and the rate-determining vibration-vibration processes between the lowest mode and others dominate the coupling energy transfer between different modes. Thus, each gas composition contributes directly one single relaxation process to the molecular relaxation in mixture, which can be illustrated by the decomposed <b>acoustic</b> relaxation <b>absorption</b> spectrum of the single relaxation process. The proposed model is validated by simulation results in good agreement with experimental data such as N_ 2, O_ 2, CO_ 2, CH_ 4 and their mixtures...|$|R

40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} are provided for acoustophoresis, i. e., {{the separation of}} species via acoustic waves. An ultrasonic transducer applies an acoustic wave to {{one end of a}} sample container containing at least two species having different <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorptions.</b> The wave has a frequency tuned to or harmonized with the point of resonance of the species to be separated. This wave caused the species to be driven to an opposite end of the sample container for removal. A second ultrasonic transducer may be provided to apply a second, oppositely directed acoustic wave to prevent undesired streaming. In addition, a radio frequency tuned to the mechanical resonance and coupled with a magnetic field can serve to identify a species in a medium comprising species with similar absorption coefficients, whereby an acoustic wave having a frequency corresponding to this gyrational rate can then be applied to sweep the identified species to one end of the container for removal...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison between}} measured and calculated acoustical parameters in eight high school classrooms. The mid frequency unoccupied and occupied reverberation times and the 1 kHz sound propagation (SP) of the reverberant and total speech levels in occupied classrooms were compared with analytical and numerical predictions. The ODEON 6. 5 code and the Sabine formula gave the most accurate results for reverberation time in the empty classrooms with overall relative differences of 8. 1 % and 9. 7 %, respectively. With students present, the Eyring and Sabine formulas and Hodgson's empirical model resulted to be the most accurate with relative differences of 11. 1 %, 13. 2 % and 13. 6 %, respectively. The reverberant speech levels decrease with increasing distance from the source at rates varying from _ 1. 21 to _ 2. 62 dB/distance doubling, and the Hodgson model fits the slope values quite well. The best predictions of the SP of the reverberant and total speech levels are shown, in order of accuracy, for the ODEON code, the Barron and Lee theory and the classical diffuse field theory. Lower rms errors were found when the measured total <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorptions</b> were used. The lowest rms error of 1. 4 dB for the SP of the total speech level were found for both the ODEON code and the Barron and Lee theor...|$|R

50|$|<b>Acoustic</b> <b>absorption</b> {{refers to}} {{the process by which}} a material, structure, or object takes in sound energy when sound waves are encountered, as opposed to {{reflecting}} the energy.

A peak at 1436 cm(- 1) which previously {{was assigned to}} the excitation of single optical magnons did not show a measurable shift with magnetic field. In the far-infrared, no signature of <b>acoustic</b> magnon <b>absorption</b> has been observed in the magneto transmittance.

50|$|There are {{two general}} ways of <b>acoustic</b> energy losses: <b>absorption</b> and scattering, for {{instance}} light scattering.Ultrasound propagation through homogeneous media is associated only with absorption {{and can be}} characterized with absorption coefficient only.

Fractional derivative wave equations can be applied for modeling of lossy acoustical wave propagation, see also acoustic attenuation and Ref.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} 50 years, the {{characterisation}} of porous {{sound absorbing materials}} has been of increasing interest to both the acoustic engineers and customers. It is particularly important that acoustic engineers are able to predict the acoustical behaviour of these materials to get a quantitative measure of the <b>acoustic</b> energy <b>absorption.</b> This paper reviews the relevant literatures over this 50 -year period and concludes that phenomenological models are currently the most accurate and suitable models of predicting the bulk acoustic properties in the whole audible frequency range. This review also presents the physical parameters which provide {{the link between the}} acoustical and material properties, as well as current experimental methods used to measure these parameters. Furthermore, the most common numerical methods for modelling porous materials are describe...|$|R
50|$|Absorbing sound spontaneously {{converts}} part of {{the sound}} energy to a very small amount of heat in the intervening object (the absorbing material), rather than sound being transmitted or reflected. There are several ways in which a material can absorb sound. The choice of sound absorbing material {{will be determined by}} the frequency distribution of noise to be absorbed and the <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorption</b> profile required.|$|E
50|$|Void {{volume and}} water absorption: Because {{of the large}} volume {{percentage}} of permeable voids, the absorption is very high within the first moments of immersion. As a direct consequence, comes interference negative in relation water - binder matrix, swelling and subsequent shrinkage of the fiber. Furthermore, the high void volume contributes to reduced weight, increased <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorption</b> and low thermal conductivity the obtained components.|$|E
50|$|The studio had {{a vintage}} 1974 EMI Neve. One of only 7 made. The {{recording}} area was a 1000 sq ft main room and mezzanine, with two adjoining isolation rooms {{and a third}} separate isolation booth. The main room was 20 ft high and was New Zealand's only high-stud professional studio live room. It had virtually no permanent <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorption,</b> relying on room shape and deflective elements to achieve control of reverberation.|$|E

A review of recent accomplishments, including representative results, is presented {{in the context of a}} Master Plan. It is suggested that modal representations of structural walls and acoustic cavities provide a useful conceptual and computational theoretical framework for including the mass, stiffness and damping of both the structure and acoustic cavity. Geometrical details and <b>acoustic</b> damping (<b>absorption)</b> are included in a rigorous manner.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the interaction of}} surface acoustic waves with electrons {{in an array of}} quantum wires, patterned out of a two dimensional electron gas. Two specific geometries are considered, in which the surface acoustic wave travels parallel, or perpendicular to the wires. Although we assume the electron wave functions in different wires do not overlap, the screening of the phonon potential by the electrons in the wire array is a collective phenomenon. It is shown that the surface <b>acoustic</b> wave <b>absorption</b> cannot be described via the ac conductivity in the usual manner. We derive an integral equation for the dielectric function of the electrons in the quantum wire system, and solve it in the narrow wire approximation. Using the dielectric function we find the absorption and the change in velocity of the surface acoustic waves. Comment: REVTeX, 8 pages, no figure...|$|R
5000|$|This is {{an index}} which is {{measured}} in field conditions, between [...] "real" [...] rooms. It is a measurement which deliberately includes effects due to flanking routes and differences in the relative size of the rooms. It attempts, however, to normalize the measured difference level to the level which would be present when the rooms are furnished by measuring the quantity of <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorption</b> in the receiving room and correcting the difference level to the level which would be expected if there was 10m2 Sabine absorption in the receiving room. Detailed, accurate knowledge of {{the dimensions of the}} receiving room are required.|$|E
5000|$|To get {{the desired}} RT60, several {{acoustics}} materials {{can be used}} as described in several books. [...] A valuable simplification of the task was proposed by Oscar Bonello in 1979 [...] It consists of using standard acoustic panels of 1 m2 hung from the walls of the room (only if the panels are parallel). These panels use a combination of three Helmholtz resonators and a wooden resonant panel. This system gives a large <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorption</b> at low frequencies (under 500 Hz) and reduces at high frequencies to compensate for the typical absorption by people, lateral surfaces, ceilings, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Drum screens {{are usually}} {{made out of}} a 0.22-inch (5.6mm) thick clear acrylic sheet material. A more {{expensive}} scratch-resistant or AR (abrasion-resistant) acrylic is also sometimes used for rugged use and touring applications. While plastic drum screens perform fairly well as sound barriers, they reflect most sound that impacts them and so very little sound is actually absorbed. Therefore, it is usually recommended that some type of <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorption</b> product, such as acoustic foam, heavy curtains, acoustic panels, or absorption baffles be used on {{a significant percentage of}} the screen surface and opposite the screen in order to soak up and dissipate as much of the direct and reflected sound energy as possible.|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} {{changes in a}} magnetic fluid (formation of clusters) upon the effect of an external magnetic field were studied by acoustic spectroscopy. The properties of magnetic fluid dispersed in inhibited transformer oil ITO 100 have been studied by the analysis {{of changes in the}} <b>acoustic</b> wave <b>absorption</b> coefficient. The <b>absorption</b> coefficient of <b>acoustic</b> waves was measured as a function of an external magnetic field in the range of 0 – 400 mT, parallel to the direction of acoustic wave propagation. The magnetic fluids change their structure under the influence of an external magnetic field and do not return immediately to the initial state after the magnetic field switching off. It is supposed that the cluster of magnetic nanoparticles formed in the fluid subjected to a magnetic field remains after the field has been removed for the some time...|$|R

An analytic expression of acoustic phonon induced broadening is given {{as a function of the}} electron-phonon matrix elements and is physically interpreted. The theory is applied to the dephasing of intersublevel transitions in self-assembled quantum dots. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
50|$|In some {{applications}} {{where the}} performance area has high ceilings that reflect {{a large percentage}} of the sound, acrylic sheet is sometimes used to almost completely surround the loud instrument on all sides and above to create what is commonly known as an isolation booth. While this technique will aid in isolating the loud sound source, the interior acoustics of any booth with such {{a large percentage of}} highly reflective surfaces will be difficult or impossible to control. It is therefore recommended that at least 60% or more of the reflective surfaces inside this type of isolation booth be treated with <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorption</b> products. It is also wise to use additional carpet padding and carpet under the entire setup to reduce reflections off the floor and absorb additional sound energy.|$|E
5000|$|Diffusion, in {{acoustics}} {{and architectural}} engineering, is the efficacy by which sound energy is spread evenly {{in a given}} environment. A perfectly diffusive sound space {{is one that has}} certain key acoustic properties which are the same anywhere in the space. A non-diffuse sound space would have considerably different reverberation time as the listener moved around the room. Virtually all spaces are non-diffuse. Spaces which are highly non-diffuse are ones where the <b>acoustic</b> <b>absorption</b> is unevenly distributed around the space, or where two different acoustic volumes are coupled. The diffusiveness of a sound field can be measured by taking reverberation time measurements at a large number of points in the room, then taking the standard deviation on these decay times [...] Alternately, the spatial distribution of the sound can be examined. Small sound spaces generally have very poor diffusion characteristics at low frequencies due to room modes.|$|E

40|$|A finite-element Galerkin {{formulation}} {{was employed}} to study the attenuation of acoustic waves propagating in two-dimensional S-curved ducts with absorbing walls without a mean flow. The reflection and transmission at the entrance and the exit of a curved duct were determined by coupling the finite-element solutions in the curved duct to the eigenfunctions of an infinite, uniform, hard wall duct. In the frequency range where the duct height and acoustic wave length are nearly equal, the effects of duct length, curvature (duct offset) and absorber thickness were examined. For a given offset in the curved duct, {{the length of the}} S-duct was found to significantly affect both the absorptive and reflective characteristics of the duct. A means of reducing the number of elements in the absorber region was also presented.
