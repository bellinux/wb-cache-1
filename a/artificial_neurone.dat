40|$|Abstract: Psychologists have various medical ways {{to treat}} {{depression}} using counselling, medicines and much more. These ways do {{not guarantee that}} depression is totally cured. Depression affects the neurons in brain, decreasing the amount of Neurotransmitter. As neuron suspends reproduction shortly after birth thus the damaged neuron can’t be replaced, {{it can only be}} treated. Thus if the biological neurons are replaced by artificial neurons then the cure of depression would be permanent. The mathematical equations in the paper also show that the <b>artificial</b> <b>neurone</b> replacement would give a permanent cure to depression...|$|E
40|$|An {{algorithm}} for compact {{neural network}} hardware implementation is presented, which exploits special {{properties of the}} Boolean functions describing the operation of <b>artificial</b> <b>neurones</b> with step activation function. The algorithm contains three steps: ANN mathematical model digitisation, conversion of the digitised model into a logic gate structure, and hardware optimisation by elimination of redundant logic gates. A set of C++ programs automates algorithm implementation, generating optimised VHDL code. This strategy bridges the gap between ANN design software and hardware design packages (Xilinx). Although the method is directly applicable only to neurones with step activation functions, it can be extended to sigmoidal functions...|$|R
40|$|This work {{used the}} Summit Visual HDL for VHDL – a Visual Hardware Description package which com-piles flowcharts, state diagrams, truth tables etc into synthesisable VHDL (VHISIC Hardware Description Language). We used this design {{environment}} {{to design and}} simulate a digital model of a single neuron. This neuron models the superficial input/output characteristics of a biological neuron, producing an ac-tion-potential-like waveform when inputs to the cell sum to reach a pre-determined threshold. It was shown that by connecting {{a number of these}} digital neuron models in a network configuration with ap-propriate input weighting, it was possible to emulate the function of a simple feed-forward neural net-work. This finding is important, because previous work has suggested that <b>artificial</b> <b>neurones</b> that are more biological in their function have the potential to form neuron networks that are more robust and noise-tolerant than conventional artificial neural networks...|$|R
40|$|Postganglionic {{sympathetic}} axons in awake healthy human subjects, {{regardless of}} their identity as muscle vasoconstrictor, cutaneous vasoconstrictor or sudomotor neurones, discharge with a low firing probability (~ 30 %), generate low firing rates (~ 0. 5 Hz) and typically fire only once per cardiac interval. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to use modelling of spike trains in an attempt to define the number of preganglionic neurones that drive an individual postganglionic <b>neurone.</b> <b>Artificial</b> spike trains were generated in 1 - 3 preganglionic neurones converging onto a single postganglionic neurone. Each preganglionic input fired with a mean interval distribution of either 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 or 3000 ms and the standard deviation varied between 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 x the mean interval; the discharge frequency of each preganglionic neurone exhibited positive skewness and kurtosis. Of the 45 patterns examined, the mean discharge properties of the postganglionic neurone could only be explained by it being driven by, on average, two preganglionic neurones firing with a mean interspike interval of 2500 ms and SD of 5000 ms. The mean firing rate resulting from this pattern was 0. 22 Hz, comparable to that of spontaneously active muscle vasoconstrictor neurones in healthy subjects (0. 40 Hz). Likewise, the distribution of the number of spikes per cardiac interval was similar between the modelled and actual data: 0 spikes (69. 5 vs 66. 6 %), 1 spike (25. 6 vs 21. 2 %), 2 spikes (4. 3 vs 6. 4 %), 3 spikes (0. 5 vs 1. 7 %) and 4 spikes (0. 1 vs 0. 7 %). Although some features of the firing patterns could be explained by the postganglionic neurone being driven by a single preganglionic neurone, none of the emulated firing patterns generated by the firing of three preganglionic neurones matched the discharge of the real neurones. These modelling data indicate that, on average, human postganglionic sympathetic neurones are driven by two preganglionic inputs...|$|R
