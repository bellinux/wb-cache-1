5|$|Cockroaches {{appear to}} use just {{two pieces of}} {{information}} to decide where to go, namely how dark {{it is and how}} many other cockroaches there are. A study used specially-scented roach-sized robots that appear to the roaches as real to demonstrate that once there <b>are</b> <b>enough</b> insects in a place to form a critical mass, the roaches accepted the collective decision on where to hide, even if this was an unusually light place.|$|E
5|$|If no ethnographic nor {{historical}} data are found which can support this assertion then {{acceptance of the}} idea relies upon {{whether or not there}} <b>are</b> <b>enough</b> petroglyph sites in North America that such a correlation could occur by chance. It is helpful when petroglyphs are associated with existing peoples. This allows ethnoastronomers to question informants as to the meaning of such symbols.|$|E
5|$|The {{mathematical}} {{concept of}} a Hilbert space, named after David Hilbert, generalizes the notion of Euclidean space. It extends the methods of vector algebra and calculus from the two-dimensional Euclidean plane and three-dimensional space to spaces with any finite or infinite number of dimensions. A Hilbert space is an abstract vector space possessing the structure of an inner product that allows length and angle to be measured. Furthermore, Hilbert spaces are complete: there <b>are</b> <b>enough</b> limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used.|$|E
50|$|Swahili, {{like all}} other Bantu languages, has {{numerous}} noun classes. Verbs must agree in class with their subjects and objects, and adjectives with the nouns that they qualify. For example: Kitabu kimoja kitatosha (One book will <b>be</b> <b>enough),</b> Mchungwa mmoja utatosha (One orange-tree will <b>be</b> <b>enough),</b> Chungwa moja litatosha (One orange will <b>be</b> <b>enough).</b> There <b>is</b> also agreement in number. For example: Vitabu viwili vitatosha (Two books will <b>be</b> <b>enough),</b> Michungwa miwili itatosha (Two orange-trees will <b>be</b> <b>enough),</b> Machungwa mawili yatatosha (Two oranges will <b>be</b> <b>enough).</b> Class and number are indicated with prefixes (or sometimes their absence), which are not always the same for nouns, adjectives and verbs, {{as illustrated by the}} examples.|$|R
50|$|The relegation battle {{ended in}} {{disappointment}} for Wolves and Peterborough. The late goal for Crystal Palace against Peterborough meant that a 1-1 draw <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> for Blackburn, a 2-0 win for Sheffield Wednesday over Middlesbrough <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> {{to secure their}} safety, a 1-0 defeat for Millwall against Derby County <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> for them and a 2-2 draw between Huddersfield and Barnsley <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> for both teams. Wolves lost 2-0 to Brighton, having started {{the day in the}} most difficult situation of the threatened teams.|$|R

5|$|To {{ensure that}} there <b>are</b> <b>enough</b> signal {{transitions}} for clock recovery {{to occur in the}} bitstream, a bit stuffing technique is applied to the data stream: an extra 0bit is insert into the data stream after any occurrence of six consecutive 1bits. (Thus ensuring that there is a 0bit to cause a transmission state transition.) Seven consecutively received 1bits are always an error. For USB3.0, additional data transmission encoding is used to handle the higher data rates required.|$|E
5|$|Edward Drinker Cope {{described}} his finds in two 1878 {{issues of the}} American Naturalist, and assigned them to the new genus Amphicoelias. He placed it in a unique family, Amphicoeliidae, though this is now considered a nomen oblitum (forgotten name). The genus is usually assigned to the family Diplodocidae, though some modern analyses have found it {{at the base of}} the larger group Diplodocoidea or as a diplodocid incertae sedis (uncertain placement). The first named species in the genus, Amphicoelias altus (holotype specimen AMHD 5764), was discovered by Cope in 1877. But while it is only represented by a partial skeleton, there <b>are</b> <b>enough</b> diagnostic characteristics to provisionally define the genus. A. altus is known from better remains, but is smaller than A. fragillimus. Cope also named a second species in 1878: Amphicoelias latus.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to fueling Hero actions, Bezels {{act as a}} safeguard to character defeat. Characters will not receive any direct damage {{as long as there}} is at least one Bezel. If there <b>are</b> <b>enough</b> Bezels remaining, receiving damage that would otherwise defeat the character instead causes the character to be knocked into the air and the Bezel is shattered into shards that scatter across the battlefield. If the player does not have any Bezels remaining, the characters go into critical mode. Critical mode causes the characters to become extremely scared, leaving them unable to shoot quickly, unable to use Hero actions, and taking direct damage from every attack. Four Bezel Shards must be collected by the characters in order to restore a Bezel and replenish their power, and enemies can even pick up Bezel Shards to regenerate health and shields. The game ends if any character is killed and there are no intact Bezels to protect them.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} iterations, no search {{algorithm}} that works only by comparing elements can exhibit better average and worst case performance than binary search. This {{is because the}} comparison tree representing binary search has the fewest levels possible as each level is filled completely with nodes if there <b>are</b> <b>enough.</b> Otherwise, the search algorithm can eliminate few elements in an iteration, {{increasing the number of}} iterations required in the average and worst case. This is the case for other search algorithms based on comparisons, as while they may work faster on some target values, the average performance over all elements is affected. This problem is solved by binary search, as dividing the array in half ensures that the size of both subarrays are as similar as possible.|$|E
5|$|Osborn and Mook, in 1921, {{provisionally}} synonymized {{the three}} species, sinking A. latus into Camarasaurus supremus, and suggesting also that A. fragillimus {{is just a}} very large individual of A. altus, a position which most subsequent studies, including McIntosh 1998, Foster (2007), and Woodruff and Foster (2015) have agreed with. Carpenter (2006) disagreed about the synonymy of A. altus and A. fragillimus, however, citing numerous differences {{in the construction of}} the vertebra also noted by Cope, and suggested these differences <b>are</b> <b>enough</b> to warrant a separate species or even a separate genus for A. fragillimus. However, he went on to caution that the validity of A. fragillimus as a separate species is nearly impossible to determine without the original specimen to study. Although Amphicoelias latus is clearly not Amphicoelias, it is probably synonymous with Camarasaurus grandis rather than C. supremus because it was found lower in the Morrison Formation and the deeply concave articular faces on the caudal vertebrae are more consistent with C. grandis.|$|E
5|$|Score Entertainment {{created a}} Sonic X {{collectible}} card game for two players, released in 2005. Players battle for Chaos Emeralds; whoever gets three first wins. Each turn, both players lay out five cards face-down and flip over {{one at a}} time; whichever card has a lower number value is eliminated. Eliminating the other player's cards and combining the special abilities of one's own cards allows one to score rings; whichever player has the most rings {{at the end of}} the turn wins an Emerald. As the game does not emphasize collecting rare cards, a few booster packs <b>are</b> <b>enough</b> to build a competent deck. KidzWorld gave a positive review, praising its ease of learning, low cost, and inherent strategy, but also noting that it feels more like a generic card game with Sonic characters than like a wholly Sonic-based product.|$|E

5|$|The {{medication}} typically recommended first are NSAIDs (though not aspirin) or {{skeletal muscle}} relaxants and these <b>are</b> <b>enough</b> for most people. Benefits with NSAIDs; however, is often small. High-quality reviews have found acetaminophen (paracetamol) {{to be no}} more effective than placebo at improving pain, quality of life, or function. NSAIDs are more effective for acute episodes than acetaminophen; however, they carry a greater risk of side effects including: kidney failure, stomach ulcers and possibly heart problems. Thus, NSAIDs are a second choice to acetaminophen, recommended only when the pain is not handled by the latter. NSAIDs are available in several different classes; {{there is no evidence to}} support the use of COX-2 inhibitors over any other class of NSAIDs with respect to benefits. With respect to safety naproxen may be best. Muscle relaxants may be beneficial.|$|E
5|$|When meeting {{another of}} the same species, P. fimbriata does not stalk but {{displays}} by moving quickly and smoothly, and displays at 4 to 27centimetres away. It raises its legs, its body sways from side to side, and the palps are lowered below the chelicerae ("fangs"). This {{is very different from}} the stalking it uses when encountering another salticid of a different species, despite receiving the same visual stimulus, the sight of the other's large anterior-median eyes. Although P. fimbriata is influenced by pheromones much more than is usual among salticids, visual cues alone <b>are</b> <b>enough</b> to start displays and distinguish members of the same species from other salticids, even if neither partner moves. The spindly, fringed legs of Portia species may identify members of the same species, as well as concealing these spiders from other salticid species.|$|E
5|$|Karas {{impressed}} its reviewers {{with its}} animated imagery. Mania Entertainment affirmed its lush imagery <b>are</b> <b>enough</b> to hook viewers, and certain 2D-3D scenes matched photorealistic standards. They felt Karas could rival or beat live-action {{films in the}} visual department. DVD Talk commented they saw evidence {{a lot of effort}} went into merging the 2D and 3D animations. They, however, felt setting the scenes in darkness and obscuring points of interest with smoke or other effects marred the high quality imagery. Anime News Network stated the richly detailed images; fast moving action scenes; and visual effects of collapsing buildings, explosions, and blood made Karas one of the best action animation. Reviewers praised the fight scenes between the CG generated karas and mikuras, declaring them realistic, tasteful and stunning. DVD Talk, however, complained the camera jerked and moved all over the place never showing fights cleanly. Mania stated the fights in the later half failed to match those in the first half in terms of beauty, intensity, and variety; the overlaying of characters' face onto their armored forms in the finale detracted from their viewing experience.|$|E
