25|$|ACE inhibitors {{block the}} {{conversion}} of angiotensin I (AI) to angiotensin II (AII). They thereby lower <b>arteriolar</b> resistance and increase venous capacity; decrease cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke work, and volume; lower resistance in {{blood vessels in the}} kidneys; and lead to increased natriuresis (excretion of sodium in the urine).|$|E
25|$|The lungs {{activate}} one hormone. The physiologically inactive decapeptide angiotensin I {{is converted}} to the aldosterone-releasing octapeptide, angiotensin II, in the pulmonary circulation. The reaction occurs in other tissues as well, but it is particularly prominent in the lungs. Angiotensin II also has a direct effect on <b>arteriolar</b> walls, causing <b>arteriolar</b> vasoconstriction, and consequently a rise in arterial blood pressure. Large amounts of the angiotensin-converting enzyme responsible for this activation are located on the surfaces of the endothelial cells of the alveolar capillaries. The converting enzyme also inactivates bradykinin. Circulation time through the alveolar capillaries is less than one second, yet 70% of the angiotensin I reaching the lungs {{is converted to}} angiotensin II in a single trip through the capillaries. Four other peptidases have been identified {{on the surface of}} the pulmonary endothelial cells.|$|E
25|$|There are oxygen sensors in {{the smaller}} bronchi and bronchioles. In {{response}} to low partial pressures of oxygen in the inhaled air these sensors reflexly cause the pulmonary arterioles to constrict. (This is {{the exact opposite of}} the corresponding reflex in the tissues, where low arterial partial pressures of O2 cause <b>arteriolar</b> vasodilation.) At altitude this causes the pulmonary arterial pressure to rise resulting in a much more even distribution of blood flow to the lungs than occurs at sea level. At sea level the pulmonary arterial pressure is very low, with the result that the tops of the lungs receive far less blood than the bases, which are relatively over-perfused with blood. It is only in middle of the lungs that the blood and air flow to the alveoli are ideally matched. At altitude this variation in the ventilation/perfusion ratio of alveoli from the tops of the lungs to the bottoms is eliminated, with all the alveoli perfused and ventilated in more or less the physiologically ideal manner. This is a further important contributor to the acclimatatization to high altitudes and low oxygen pressures.|$|E

5000|$|Hypertensive {{retinopathy}} is {{a condition}} characterized by a spectrum of retinal vascular signs in people with elevated blood pressure. It was first described by Liebreich in 1859. The retinal circulation undergoes a series of pathophysiological changes in response to elevated blood pressure. In the initial, vasoconstrictive stage, there is vasospasm {{and an increase in}} retinal <b>arteriolar</b> tone owing to local autoregulatory mechanisms. This stage is seen clinically as a generalized narrowing of the retinal arterioles. Persistently elevated blood pressure leads to intimal thickening, hyperplasia of the media wall, and hyaline degeneration in the subsequent, sclerotic, stage. This stage corresponds to more severe generalized and focal areas of <b>arteriolar</b> narrowing, changes in the <b>arteriolar</b> and venular junctions, and alterations in the <b>arteriolar</b> light reflex (i.e., widening and accentuation of the central light reflex, or [...] "copper wiring").|$|E

50|$|Some sheep {{have been}} shown to be {{resistant}} to the harmful effects of sheep keds. Resistant sheep’s skin was histologically examined and showed <b>arteriolar</b> vasoconstriction in addition to fibrinoid degeneration of the tunica media in the lower dermis. This subepidermal region showed an increased infiltration of eosinophils and lymphocytes. The upper dermis of resistant sheep showed an increase of empty capillaries, whereas the upper dermis of susceptible sheep showed capillaries filled with red cells. The resistance of some sheep to keds was due to prolonged cutaneous <b>arteriolar</b> vasoconstriction. In resistant sheep, keds were unable to obtain enough blood and eventually died from starvation.|$|E

Only a minute fraction of the fluid that leaks out of the capillaries (over the whole body) is not reabsorbed. This excess water that accumulates in the tissues is collected by the lymph vessels and returned to the blood circulation into the left subclavian vein at the lower left hand side of the neck. Only between 2-4 liters of lymph accumulates in the tissues per day and is discharged back into the venous system in the neck.|$|E
5000|$|The {{critical}} {{target of the}} trans-JGA signaling cascade is the glomerular afferent arteriole; its response consists {{of an increase in}} net vasoconstrictor tone resulting in reductions of glomerular capillary pressure (PGC) and glomerular plasma flow. Efferent arterioles appear to play a lesser role; experimental evidence supports both vasoconstriction and vasodilation, with perhaps the former in the lower range and the latter in the higher range of NaCl concentrations (2). When feedback regulation of afferent <b>arteriolar</b> tone is prevented by interrupting the feedback loop, and when the sensing mechanism is fully activated by saturating NaCl concentrations, TGF reduces GFR on average by approximately 45% and PGC by approximately 20%.
