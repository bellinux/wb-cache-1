5|$|When first {{described}} in 1924, Velociraptor {{was placed in}} the family Megalosauridae, {{as was the case with}} most carnivorous dinosaurs at the time (Megalosauridae, like Megalosaurus, functioned <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of 'wastebin' taxon, where many unrelated species were grouped together). As dinosaur discoveries multiplied, Velociraptor was later recognized as a dromaeosaurid. All dromaeosaurids have also been referred to the family Archaeopterygidae by at least one author (which would, in effect, make Velociraptor a flightless bird).|$|E

5|$|Although modern fantasy {{may often}} embrace strangeness, the Ice and Fire series is {{generally}} praised {{for what is}} perceived <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of medieval realism. Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre, Martin {{set out to make}} the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters. Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end with less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies. In Martin's eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension, not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells. As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements like the Others.|$|E
40|$|We develop <b>a</b> {{theory of}} <b>sorted</b> bigraphical {{reactive}} systems. Every application of bigraphs {{in the literature}} has required <b>an</b> extension, <b>a</b> <b>sorting,</b> of pure bigraphs. In turn, every such application has required a redevelopment {{of the theory of}} pure bigraphical reactive systems for the sorting at hand. Here we present a general construction of sortings. The constructed sortings always sustain the behavioural theory of pure bigraphs (in a precise sense), thus obviating the need to redevelop that theory for each new application. As an example, we recover Milner’s local bigraphs <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sorting</b> on pure bigraphs. Technically, we give our construction for ordinary reactive systems, then lift it to bigraphical reactive systems. As such, we give also a construction of sortings for ordinary reactive systems. This construction is an improvement over previous attempts in that it produces smaller and much more natural sortings, as witnessed by our recovery of local bigraphs <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sorting...</b>|$|R

Some fans see Les Invisibles' actions in favour of England against Spain <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of vengeance for the extermination by the conquistadores of their worshippers in Central America, while others view their intervention as only part of the mysterious scheme carried on by the alien entities through the centuries ("In the Presence of Another World").|$|E
5|$|Eliot {{started writing}} East Coker in 1939, and {{modelled}} the poem after Burnt Norton {{as a way}} to focus his thoughts. The poem served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of opposite to the popular idea that The Waste Land served as an expression of disillusionment after World War I, though Eliot never accepted this interpretation. The poem focuses on life, death, and continuity between the two. Humans are seen as disorderly and science is viewed as unable to save mankind from its flaws. Instead, science and reason lead mankind to warfare, and humanity needs to become humble in order to escape the cycle of destruction. To be saved, people must recognize Christ as their savior as well as their need for redemption.|$|E

Ethologically, the human keeper of a cat may function <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of surrogate for the cat's mother, and adult housecats live their lives in a kind of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny. The high-pitched sounds housecats make to solicit food may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them particularly hard for humans to ignore.|$|E

5|$|Through his freemason {{contacts}} with Pierre Maurice Glayre, Piattoli won {{the confidence of}} Poland's King Stanisław August Poniatowski, becoming his agent in Paris and, {{by the end of}} 1789, his private secretary and librarian, although without any official title. Acting <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of cultural aide, Piattoli, who had strong ties to the reformist and often anti-royal opposition, became an important link between the reformers—Ignacy Potocki in particular—and the king. In the words of a Swedish diplomat, L. Engstrom, he was “like a tireless spring”, constantly mediating between the two factions.|$|E
5|$|When Victoria became queen in 1837, Lehzen served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of {{unofficial}} private secretary, enjoying apartments {{adjacent to}} Victoria's. The Queen's marriage to Prince Albert in 1840 led to {{significant changes in}} the royal household. Albert and Lehzen detested each other, and after an illness of the Princess Royal in 1841, Lehzen was quietly dismissed. Her close relationship with the Queen came to an end, although the two continued to write letters to each other. Lehzen spent her last years in Hanover on a generous pension, dying in 1870. Historian K. D. Reynolds writes that Lehzen was a major influence on Victoria's character, in particular giving her the strength of will to survive her troubled childhood and life as a young queen.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} folk tales about the Sumatran rhino were {{collected}} by colonial naturalists and hunters from the mid-19th century to early 20th century. In Burma, the belief was once widespread that the Sumatran rhino ate fire. Tales described the fire-eating rhino following smoke to its source, especially campfires, and then attacking the camp. There was also a Burmese belief that {{the best time to}} hunt was every July, when the Sumatran rhinos would congregate beneath the full moon. In Malaya, it was said that the rhino's horn was hollow and could be used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of hose for breathing air and squirting water. In Malaya and Sumatra, it was once believed that the rhino shed its horn every year and buried it under the ground. In Borneo, the rhino was said to have a strange carnivorous practice: after defecating in a stream, it would turn around and eat fish that had been stupefied by the excrement.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we attempt to {{investigate}} the linkages between value-based performance measurements and risk-return trade off {{in a way to}} explain cross sectional asset returns. On the side of value based performance measurements, three groups of variables are used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sorting</b> factor: traditional measures which consist of accounting based and market based; recently popularized measures such as Economic Value Added and Market Value Added and theoretically sound measures such as foreign investor allocation and firm systematic risk indicators. The goals of the study are (i) to show how value based measurements techniques relate to risk return trade off and (ii) how these measures affect the cross sectional asset returns in manufacturing industry. Empirical results indicate that foreign investor allocation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sorting</b> factor produces much more meaningful risk return positive linear relation for cross sectional asset returns than traditional and recently popularized measures.

5|$|The film, under Hancock's {{direction}} and Tristan's writing, had originally a different tone and premise than what {{would eventually be}} seen in the final film. The two had envisioned Amity <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of ghost-town when the film opened with several businesses shuttered and the island's overall economy in ruins due to the events seen in the first film. The new resort and condos built on the island by developer Len Peterson were to help celebrate its rebirth giving the island's economy a much needed boost. Tristan had borrowed a subplot from the original Jaws novel and from a discarded early draft of the first film, in which Amity officials were in debt to the Mafia. Both Mayor Vaughn and Len Peterson were anxious for the new island resort to be a success not only to revive Amity but to pay back loans from the Mob that helped build it, thus leading to Vaughn's and Peterson's ignoring of Brody's warning. Tristan and Hancock felt this treatment would lead to more character development that would make the overall story that much more believable.|$|E
5|$|When Victoria {{ascended the}} throne in 1837, Lehzen enjoyed a {{prominent}} {{position at the}} coronation, and remained at court. Lehzen was installed at Buckingham Palace <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of unofficial private secretary, served as chief liaison for the royal residences, and carried the household keys {{as a sign of}} her position; her signature was required for all payments of tradesmen's bills, for instance. At this point, it seems that Lehzen had totally replaced Victoria's mother both in terms of influence and affection; Lehzen's apartments adjoined the queen's, while the Duchess of Kent was installed in a suite of rooms far removed from Victoria's. For {{the first few years of}} Victoria's reign, especially before her marriage to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1840, Lehzen had a very strong influence on the queen's outlook on both politics and personal matters, despite the fact that she did not overtly involve herself in state affairs. Even after the queen's marriage, Lehzen retained the private doorway into the royal bedroom, a source of displeasure for Albert.|$|E
