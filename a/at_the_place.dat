When Knave, a younger collie, is boarded <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Place,</b> Lady begins {{ignoring}} Lad {{in favor of}} the newcomer. During a romp in the forest with Knave, Lady is caught in a leghold trap. Knave leaves her there and returns home but Lad finds her. Several days later, the still limping Lady accidentally gets locked in the library and is subsequently blamed for the destruction of the Master's beloved mounted bald eagle. The Master starts to whip her, but Lad intervenes and takes the whipping himself, knowing Knave was the culprit. Later, he attacks Knave for getting Lady in trouble, sending him fleeing from the Place. As the Master apologizes to Lad, Lady lovingly licks his wounds from the fight.|$|E

5|$|His first {{mainstream}} {{success was}} the 1976 album Oxygène. Recorded {{in a makeshift}} studio at his home, the album sold an estimated 12million copies. Oxygène was followed in 1978 by Équinoxe, and in 1979, Jarre performed to a record-breaking audience {{of more than a}} million people <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Place</b> de la Concorde, a record he has since broken three times. More albums were to follow, but his 1979 concert served as a blueprint for his future performances around the world. Several of his albums have been released to coincide with large-scale outdoor events, and he is now perhaps as well known as a performer as he is as a musician.|$|E

There were two important Alsos Mission objectives in Belgium: the corporate headquarters of Union Minière du Haut Katanga, the world's largest supplier of uranium ore, in Antwerp, and its uranium processing plant in Olen.

5|$|Service design {{management}} differs {{in several ways}} from product {{design management}}. For example, the application of international trading strategies of services is difficult because the evolution of service 'from a craftsmanship attitude to industrialization of services' requires {{the development of new}} tools, approaches, and policies. Whereas goods can be manufactured centrally and delivered around the globe, services have to be performed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> of consumption, which makes it difficult to achieve global quality consistency and effective cost control.|$|E

5|$|A defense-appointed {{expert witness}} {{in the field of}} {{biomechanics}} testified on March 5 that Nosek could not turn 180 degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward, he could not have sustained an injury {{to the back of his}} head. He further said that if Nosek fell over the first row of the fans, he must have been not only pushed, but must have jumped himself. The State Attorney immediately attacked this testimony, claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> and time, as well as some of the eyewitness testimonies, according to which Nosek fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall. The presiding judge agreed with the State Attorney on some of his points.|$|E
5|$|According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock, {{regardless}} of its size, material or key. It could also uncover treasures buried in the ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split the ground <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> where a treasure lay so that people could locate it. In some regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was {{a black man in}} chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him. The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would disappear into the ground {{to be replaced by a}} cauldron filled with gold coins. Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the alchemic ability to transmute iron into gold, the more general ability to make the one who picked it forever happy or wealthy. In some interpretations, the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires.|$|E

5|$|As they left, {{thousands}} of National Guardsmen {{who had heard}} the news were assembling <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Place</b> de Grève. The Marquis de Lafayette, in Paris as their commander-in-chief, discovered to his dismay that his soldiers were largely {{in favor of the}} march and were being egged on by agitators to join in. Even though he was one of France's greatest war heroes, Lafayette could not dissuade his troops and they began threatening to desert. Rather than see them leave as another anarchic mob, the Parisian municipal government told Lafayette to guide their movements; they also instructed him to request that the king return voluntarily to Paris to satisfy the people. Sending a swift horseman forward to warn Versailles, Lafayette contemplated the near mutiny of his men: he was aware that many of them had openly promised to kill him if he did not lead or get out of the way. At four o'clock in the afternoon, fifteen thousand guards with several thousand more civilian latecomers set off for Versailles. Lafayette reluctantly took his place at the head of their column, hoping to protect the king and public order.|$|E

The Master and the Place's {{superintendent}} try to quell the behavior, with no success. During a walk with the girl, Lad protects her from her father. The next day, while the Master and Mistress are at a show and the other workers are off on holiday, Sonya's father starts to beat her for accidentally dropping a heavy basket. Lad comes to her rescue and they retreat to the veranda where she pets him while he sleeps. When Sonya goes to the barn, her father is waiting for her and closes the door. Somehow she senses Lad beside her, which gives her the courage {{to stand up to}} her father. The man imagines he sees Lad beside her and runs away in fear. Unknown to both, Lad had died in his sleep and the Master and Mistress were crying over his body on the veranda.|$|E
5|$|Building on {{the success}} of Lad: A Dog, Terhune went on to pen thirty {{additional}} canine novels, including two featuring Lad. Further Adventures of Lad, which includes the stories of his arrival <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Place</b> and his death, was published in George H. Doran in 1922. Like the first, it {{went on to become a}} best seller, praised by both new readers and existing fans. Critics, however, gave it more mixed reviews. Though some praised the stories and Lad, others felt Lad was unbelievable and harshly denounced Terhune's writing style. Lad of Sunnybank was released in 1929 by HarperCollins, and included another selection of stories about Lad's life. Two of the collies that appear in Lad: A Dog, Lad's son Wolf and another collie named Bruce, both received their own novels. Bruce was published by E. P. Dutton in 1920 and Wolf was published by Doran in 1925.|$|E
