The coefficient of friction in the tests was in the range 0. 03 x 0. 12 for the a-C:H films and 0. 17 x 0. 28 for the ta-C films. The wear volume of the DLC films was sufficiently low to enable the direct comparison of the film properties of the worn film to the original film. The microstructure of the films after wear tests has been characterized by micro RAMAN, the mechanical properties were measured by nano indentation and the elastic modulus was measured with the laser-acoustic method. No change of the micro structure of the DLC films was observed. The observed reduction of the elastic modulus of the ta-C film is explained by the evolution of mechanical defects such as micro-cracks and cracking at the nodular defects typical in non filtered vacuum <b>arc</b> <b>depositions...</b>|$|R

A B 2 O 3 -modified ZrSiO 4 outer coating was {{prepared}} by Pulsed <b>arc</b> Discharge <b>Deposition</b> {{on the surface}} of SiC bonding layer coated carbon fiber reinforced carbon (C/C) composites. The phase compositions of the prepared coatings were analyzed by X-ray diffraction(XRD), the morphologies of the multi-layer coatings were observed by scanning electron microscopy(SEM). The influence of pulsed <b>arc</b> discharge <b>deposition</b> electric voltage and time on the phase composition, microstructure of the mixed coatings was particularly investigated. And the invalidation behavior of the as-prepared coating coated samples at 1273 K was analyzed. XRD results show that the outer layer of the coating was mainly composed of B 2 O 3 and ZrSiO 4 phase. When the deposition electric voltage was 400 V, single deposition time was 8 min, total time was 32 min, the structure and thickness of the outer layer was compact and uniform. The coating prepared at optimal technological conditions could effectively protect C/C composites from oxidation at 1273 K in air for 600 min with a weight loss of 4. 063 %. The failure of the coating at intermediate temperature is due to the generation of some cross-cracks in the coating and sectional volatilization of B 2 O 3...|$|R

50|$|Cathodic <b>arc</b> <b>{{deposition}}</b> (arc-PVD) {{which is}} a kind of ion beam deposition where an electrical arc is created that literally blasts ions from the cathode. The arc has an extremely high power density resulting in a high level of ionization (30-100%), multiply charged ions, neutral particles, clusters and macro-particles (droplets). If a reactive gas is introduced during the evaporation process, dissociation, ionization and excitation can occur during interaction with the ion flux and a compound film will be deposited.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} methods of TiN thin film {{creation}} are {{physical vapor deposition}} (PVD, usually sputter deposition, cathodic <b>arc</b> <b>deposition</b> or electron beam heating) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In both methods, pure titanium is sublimed and reacted with nitrogen in a high-energy, vacuum environment. TiN film may also be produced on Ti workpieces by reactive growth (for example, annealing) in a nitrogen atmosphere. PVD is preferred for steel parts because the deposition temperatures exceeds the austenitizing temperature of steel. TiN layers are also sputtered {{on a variety of}} higher melting point materials such as stainless steels, titanium and titanium alloys. Its high Young's modulus (values between 450 and 590 GPa {{have been reported in the}} literature [...] ) means that thick coatings tend to flake away, making them much less durable than thin ones. Titanium nitride coatings can also be deposited by thermal spraying whereas TiN powders are produced by nitridation of titanium with nitrogen or ammonia at 1200 °C.|$|E
5000|$|Naturally {{occurring}} diamond {{is almost}} always found in the crystalline form with a purely cubic orientation of sp3 bonded carbon atoms. Sometimes there are lattice defects or inclusions of atoms of other elements that give color to the stone, but the lattice arrangement of the carbons remains cubic and bonding is purely sp3. The internal energy of the cubic polytype is slightly {{lower than that of}} the hexagonal form and growth rates from molten material in both natural and bulk synthetic diamond production methods are slow enough that the lattice structure has time to grow in the lowest energy (cubic) form that is possible for sp3 bonding of carbon atoms. In contrast, DLC is typically produced by processes in which high energy precursive carbons (e.g. in plasmas, in filtered cathodic <b>arc</b> <b>deposition,</b> in sputter deposition and in ion beam deposition) are rapidly cooled or quenched on relatively cold surfaces. In those cases cubic and hexagonal lattices can be randomly intermixed, layer by atomic layer, because there is no time available for one of the crystalline geometries to grow {{at the expense of the}} other before the atoms are [...] "frozen" [...] in place in the material. Amorphous DLC coatings can result in materials that have no long-range crystalline order. Without long range order there are no brittle fracture planes, so such coatings are flexible and conformal to the underlying shape being coated, while still being as hard as diamond. In fact this property has been exploited to study atom-by-atom wear at the nanoscale in DLC.|$|E
40|$|Electron Beam High-rate Deposition with axial guns (EBHD) {{offers the}} highest coating rates of PVD {{technologies}} and shows growing industrial application. The route to ever higher coating speeds is complicated in that layers coated at high rates have a marked columnar structure. This makes them unsuitable for many applications. The effect {{is caused by}} the low energy of the vapor particles with EBHD. Plasma activation during deposition increases effectively the vapor particle energy and therewith changes drastically the properties of the deposited layers. In the SAD process (Spotless <b>arc</b> Activated <b>Deposition)</b> the EBHD is combined with a special vacuum arc discharge. The hottest point of the material being evaporated is the cathode foot point of the discharge. For selected metals, especially those with high melting points, the cathode foot point is diffuse at evaporation temperatures rather than being limited to less than 1 mm² as for known arc discharges. This „diffuse foot point“ occupies an area of many cm² and does not emit any droplets. The combination of EBHD with a hollow cathode arc discharge forms the basis of the HAD process (Hollow cathode <b>arc</b> Activated <b>Deposition).</b> For large area deposition some hollow cathodes are installed side by side and their discharges penetrate the vapor cloud. This process is particularly suitable for reactive deposition with insulating compounds such as silicon and aluminum oxides...|$|R
