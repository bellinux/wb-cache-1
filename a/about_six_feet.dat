5|$|During early August 1940, {{while she}} was still being {{outfitted}} and was in a semi-complete state, Prince of Wales was attacked by German aircraft. One bomb fell between the ship and a wet basin wall, narrowly missing a 100-ton dockside crane, and exploded underwater below the bilge keel. The explosion took place <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> from the ship's port side {{in the vicinity of the}} after group of 5.25-inch guns. Buckling of the shell plating took place over a distance of 20 to , rivets were sprung and considerable flooding took place in the port outboard compartments in the area of damage, causing a ten-degree port list. The flooding was severe, due to the fact that final compartment air tests had not yet been made and the ship did not have her pumping system in operation.|$|E
5|$|A {{storm in}} June 2011 caused public {{utilities}} including the Briarcliff library and Law Memorial Park's public pool and playing fields to be flooded. When Trump had renovated the course, his workers made unauthorized changes to its drainage system, {{which made the}} course look and play better for golfers. The alterations lowered the system's water capacity and thus raised water levels by <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>feet.</b> The Trump Organization met with the village over the issue, though {{it did not take}} corrective actions. After negotiations ended, the village billed the club $238,353. The Trump Organization blamed the flooding on a village drainage pipe which lacked a grate, and blamed the conflict on then-Briarcliff mayor William Vescio, who owns a company that previously came into conflict with Trump. Vescio denied the relation to the previous conflict and claimed that the flooding was caused by rocks and trees at washed down the hill from the golf club.|$|E

Weiss was a leading baritone in the Pyne and Harrison Opera Company at Covent Garden in the late 1850s-early 1860s.|$|R

Umbopa did so, at the same time {{slipping}} off the long military great coat which he wore, and revealing himself naked except for the moocha round his centre and a necklace of lions' claws. Certainly he was a magnificent-looking man; I never saw a finer native. Standing <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>foot</b> three high he was broad in proportion, and very shapely. In that light, too, his skin looked scarcely more than dark, except here and there where deep black scars marked old assegai wounds. Sir Henry walked up to him and looked into his proud, handsome face.|$|R
25|$|Sometime between 9 and 9:30 PM, Smith {{approached}} the wharf entrance. He held his rifle over his right shoulder, muzzle pointing upwards {{and to the}} rear. At the entrance, he ordered the men who followed him to remain there while he proceeded alone up {{the center of the}} wharf. Approaching Landers and the other man, Smith ordered them off the wharf. They obeyed by jumping over the side to the beach <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> below. Smith continued, passing Tanner and Murphy without addressing them, nor did they offer resistance. Smith continued towards Reid, who called out, “Halt, you can’t go down there.” Witnesses claimed Reid and Smith argued for a few seconds, swearing at each other.|$|E
25|$|The {{performer}} sits or {{stands between}} the light source and the blank surface, while having {{the option to}} perform {{in front of the}} performance surface or behind it, with each having different advantages. The performer has another option to perform from the left or the right of the light source. The farther the hands are from the light, the smaller the shadows will be, while the closer the hands are to the light, the larger the shadows will be. Also, the closer the hands are to the blank surface, the sharper the shadows will be. Trewey suggests that the most convenient distance for the light from the hands is four feet while the hands from the performance surface should be <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>feet.</b> The performer should always watch their shadows instead of their hands.|$|E
25|$|Artwork, {{exterior}} details, landscaping, {{and other}} {{finishing touches on}} the construction of Federal Triangle occupied the period from 1938 to 1947. Landscaping issues of the Grand Plaza and Circular Plaza were considered in January 1934. To protect the Federal Triangle from flooding by the Potomac River (as had happened in 1871), the north and west grounds of the Washington Monument were raised in the summer of 1938 by <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> (two metres) in order to form a dike against any future floodwaters. The final art installation in the complex was the Oscar Straus Memorial Fountain, designs for which were first considered in December 1933. Plans for the memorial were brought before President Roosevelt for his approval the same month. Discussion continued into 1934. The Federal Triangle project was considered complete with the installation of the Straus Memorial in 1947.|$|E

25|$|Yellowstone {{anchored}} at Quiberon Bay at 0953 on 14 February 1919. Her troubles {{were not}} over, however, as she grazed the jetty wall while entering the locks at St. Nazaire. At 0545, the engineer officer {{reported to the}} captain that two boilers were under water and the steam was cut off. As Yellowstone moored alongside the nearby quay, her crew broke out a tarpaulin and collision mat. Soon thereafter, Yellowstone, still with way on, nudged into the bridge walk of the lock. By 0630, under tow by a French tug, she reached a safe basin, where she dropped both anchors and her crew began {{to take stock of}} the situation. Divers examining the damage reported that a hole, six inches (15.2cm) in width, had been opened up in Yellowstones side, extending from a point 10 feet (3 meters) beneath the waterline and <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> (1.8 meters) in length. Drydocked on 11 March 1919, Yellowstone grazed the French passenger ship SS Alesia that morning, causing minor damage to Alesias railings on her promenade deck and boat deck.|$|E

500|$|The 1950 playoffs were {{overshadowed by}} an on-ice mishap {{in the opening}} game between Toronto and Detroit, in which the Red Wings' young star player, Gordie Howe, was seriously injured. Late in the game with Toronto leading 4–0, Kennedy stole the puck from Detroit defenseman Jack Stewart and was {{carrying}} it down the left wing <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>feet</b> from the boards into the Detroit end of the rink. Stewart was pursuing him from behind and Howe was coming in fast from the side to try to cut him off. Kennedy saw Howe coming at the last moment, {{and was able to}} dodge Howe's check while passing the puck to Sid Smith, but Howe could not stop and crashed head-first into the boards, with Stewart falling on top of him. Howe sustained a concussion, facial fractures, and a lacerated right eyeball, and doctors had to perform emergency procedures on him at the hospital to save his life. Detroit coach Tommy Ivan and general manager Jack Adams accused Kennedy of deliberately butt-ending Howe. Kennedy had not been assessed a penalty on the play. After the game Kennedy said, [...] "I don't know how he got it. I avoided his check along the boards and didn't feel anything hit me, although he may have struck my stick." ...|$|E

500|$|Robert Catesby (1573–1605), {{a man of}} [...] "ancient, {{historic}} and distinguished lineage", was the inspiration behind the plot.

[...] Along with several other conspirators, he {{took part in the}} Earl of Essex's rebellion in 1601, during which he was wounded and captured. [...] Queen Elizabeth allowed him to escape with his life after fining him 4,000marks (equivalent to more than £6million in 2008), after which he sold his estate in Chastleton. [...] In 1603 Catesby helped to organise a mission to the new king of Spain, Philip III, urging Philip to launch an invasion attempt on England, which they assured him would be well supported, particularly by the English Catholics. [...] Thomas Wintour (1571–1606) was chosen as the emissary, but the Spanish king, although sympathetic to the plight of Catholics in England, was intent on making peace with James. [...] Wintour had also attempted to convince the Spanish envoy Don Juan de Tassis that [...] "3,000 Catholics" [...] were ready and waiting to support such an invasion. [...] Concern was voiced by Pope Clement VIII that using violence to achieve a restoration of Catholic power in England would result in the destruction of those that remained.|$|E
