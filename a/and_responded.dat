5|$|At the {{testimonial}} dinner, Heikkinen’s six-year-old brother, Donald Heikkinen, {{was asked}} to name the greatest football {{player in the world}} <b>and</b> <b>responded,</b> “Ralph.” Donald offered that Ralph was best because he used “proper technique,” and found it difficult to choose his older brother’s greatest play because “there were so many of them.” Referring to the Ohio State game, Donald noted, “Ralph crushed through and smeared ‘em.” Heikkinen, or “Hike” as he was known to Yoopers, was presented with a purse of $36 representing the No. 36 he wore for Michigan.|$|E
40|$|A {{sense and}} {{response}} system senses important {{changes in the}} environment <b>and</b> <b>responds</b> to the change. Examples of sense and response systems that deal with securing critical infrastructure are applications that sense <b>and</b> <b>respond</b> to natural <b>and</b> man-made disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, radiation hazards, fires, and terrorist attacks. Pervasive sense and response systems are systems in which sensors and actuators are pervasive across the infrastructure. This chapter deals with systems in which the community helps to sense <b>and</b> <b>respond</b> to rapidly evolving threats. Dense networks of sensors can be deployed {{with the help of}} the community. For example, we describe how inexpensive accelerometers deployed in homes and offices can help to sense <b>and</b> <b>respond</b> to earthquakes...|$|R

40|$|In dialogue, {{it is not}} {{uncommon}} for people to laugh together. This joint laughter often results in overlapping laughter, consisting of an initiating laugh (the first one), <b>and</b> a <b>responding</b> laugh (the second one). In previous studies, we found that overlapping laughs are acoustically different from non-overlapping ones. So far, we have considered overlapping laughs as one category. Consequently, it is unknown whether there are also acoustic differences between initiating laughs <b>and</b> <b>responding</b> laughs. In this paper, we make a distinction between initiating, <b>responding,</b> <b>and</b> non-overlapping laughs and compare their acoustic characteristics. In particular, we will investigate the prosodic relations between initiating <b>and</b> <b>responding</b> laughs. Do these relations point to a form of accommodation and mimicry? To what extent are initiating <b>and</b> <b>responding</b> laughs paired to each other? The analyses were performed on two speech corpora containing spontaneous conversations between two speakers. Results show indications that initiating <b>and</b> <b>responding</b> laughs share several similar acoustic features that point towards accommodation and mimicry mechanisms...|$|R
5|$|Due to his red card {{suspension}} in the World Cup, Gourcuff missed two call-ups to {{the national}} team in August and September. In October 2010, he was called back into the team by his former manager at Bordeaux Laurent Blanc for UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying matches against Romania and Luxembourg. In the match against Romania, Gourcuff appeared as a substitute and scored the final goal in the team's 2–0 victory. He was inserted into the starting lineup against Luxembourg <b>and</b> <b>responded</b> by assisting on the opening goal scored by Karim Benzema and scoring the second goal in another 2–0 win.|$|E
5|$|In 1838 Planché was to {{collaborate}} on an opera with another notable composer, Felix Mendelssohn. Mendelssohn originally approved of Planché's choice of topic, Edward III's siege of Calais in the Hundred Years War, <b>and</b> <b>responded</b> positively {{to the first}} two acts of the libretto. But, after Mendelssohn received the final act, he expressed doubts about the subject, asked Planché to start work on a completely new libretto, and eventually stopped replying to Planché's letters. The opera was never realised.|$|E
5|$|When the {{inhabitants}} of Alexandria heard of Caracalla's claims that he had killed his brother Geta in self-defence, they produced a satire mocking this as well as Caracalla's other pretensions. In 215 Caracalla travelled to Alexandria <b>and</b> <b>responded</b> to this insult by slaughtering the deputation of leading citizens who had unsuspectingly assembled before the city to greet his arrival, before setting his troops against Alexandria for several days of looting and plunder. Following the massacre at Alexandria, Caracalla moved east onto Armenia. By 216 he had pushed through Armenia and south into Parthia.|$|E

5|$|As Han troops {{returned}} from the Han–Nanyue War in 111 BC, the Han government debated annexing Dongyue. Dongyue, under King Zou Yushan, had agreed to assist the Han campaign against Nanyue, but the Dongyue army never reached Nanyue. Yushan blamed the delay on the weather. The proposal to annex Dongyue was suggested by General Yang Pu, but was dismissed by Emperor Wu. The naval force arrived home without having attacked Dongyue. Zou caught wind of Yang's request, <b>and</b> <b>responded</b> by revolting against the Han. Han forces were led by General Han Yue, General Yang Pu, commander Wang Wenshu, and two marquises of Yue ancestry. The army crushed the rebellion and captured Dongyue in {{the last months of}} 111 BC, placing the former Minyue territory under Han rule.|$|E

With an uphill finish, Van Dijk lost the sprint from Johansson (Orica-AIS) and finished second ahead of Amy Pieters (Rabo Liv). Van Dijk won the mountain classification of the race. In June, Van Dijk started as the main favourite at the Dutch National Time Trial Championships, but did not win her fourth time trial title. She finished second, with a margin of only 0.02 seconds, behind Annemiek van Vleuten (Rabo Liv). Van Dijk was disappointed <b>and</b> <b>responded</b> that she was not that good as in 2013 without having a real explanation for it.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Tabsor the 3rd (Lahore), 7th (Meerut) and 75th Divisions {{attacked}} the entrenched Ottoman Empire Eighth Army defending the Tabsor defences. These defences {{were located in}} the middle section of the front line, assigned to the XXI Corps. On their left the Battle of Tulkarm was being fought with the Battle of Arara fought on their right. Together with the cavalry phase, these battles make up the Battle of Sharon, which, with the Battle of Nablus, fought by the XX Corps and Chaytor's Force, have {{become known as the}} Battle of Megiddo. Megiddo developed into a major set piece offensive, when large formations of the Allied EEF, attacked <b>and</b> <b>responded</b> to the reactions of three Ottoman armies, each time following a predetermined plan. The offensive resulted in defeat for Ottoman forces in Palestine, Syria and the Transjordan.|$|E

In this role she traveled with Holmes during publicity for the actresses's film roles, sat in on interviews, <b>and</b> <b>responded</b> to questions about Holmes from journalists. Warner Bros. made special accommodations for Feshbach to accompany Holmes during promotion of Batman Begins, and she attended Holmes' wedding to Cruise in Italy in 2006. Feshbach was later a guest of honor at Scientology's Patron Ball, held at the organization's headquarters in Britain. By 2009, Feshbach had become a high-ranking spokesperson for the Scientology organization.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, McNair's {{idea for}} a Yellow Jacket was reintroduced by another Georgia Tech student, Richie Bland. Bland, who was {{apparently}} unaware of McNair's prior initiative, paid $1,400 to have a local theme park costume designer make a yellow jacket costume that he first wore at a pep rally prior to the Tennessee football game. Rather than obtain permission from Georgia Tech as Judi had done in 1972, this student, {{a few weeks later}} simply sneaked onto the field in costume during a football game and ran across the field. The fans naturally believed that this costumed character was acting as an official member of the cheerleading squad <b>and</b> <b>responded</b> accordingly. By 1980 this new incarnation of the yellow jacket mascot was given the name Buzz Bee and was adopted as an official mascot by Georgia Tech. This new Buzz character would be the model for a new Georgia Tech emblem, designed in 1985 by Mike Lester.|$|E

5|$|In November 1791, a French convoy sailed from Mahé on {{the short}} journey to Mangalore. The convoy {{included}} two merchant vessels and the frigate Résolue, a 36-gun warship under Captain Callamand. Passing northwards, the convoy soon passed Tellicherry and Cornwallis sent Strachan with Phoenix and Perseverance to stop and inspect the French ships to ensure they were not carrying military supplies. As Smith halted the merchant ships and sent boats to inspect them, Strachan did the same to Résolue, hailing the French captain and placing an officer in a small boat to board the frigate. The French captain was outraged at this violation of his neutrality, <b>and</b> <b>responded</b> by opening fire: British sources suggest that his initial target was the small boat, although Phoenix was the ship most immediately damaged.|$|E
5|$|In initial tests run during 2006 by David Ferrucci, {{the senior}} manager of IBM's Semantic Analysis and Integration department, Watson was given 500 clues from past Jeopardy! programs.

He made his debut for Tamil Nadu Under-14s in early 1999, and after scoring 78 and 26 {{in his two}} interstate matches, was promoted to the Under-16 team in November, still less than 14 and half years old. After spending the entire 19992000 season in the Under-16s, {{he was promoted to}} the Under-19 team {{at the start of the}} 200001 season, aged 15 years and 3 months, despite scoring only 52 runs at 10.40 at Under-16 level and still being eligible for that age group. The selectors’ decision did not result in increased productivity from Karthik; he scored 133 runs at 22.16 in seven innings with a top-score of 39, and was demoted back to the Under-16s in November, <b>and</b> <b>responded</b> immediately with 124 in his first innings against Karnataka. He added two further fifties in the season, including a 99 against Kerala. Karthik ended with 367 runs at 52.42 for the season.|$|E

5|$|Later that {{afternoon}} Allen {{decided to break}} contact and return to base, to avoid fighting a battle that could last until the evening. In the meantime, however, he called in air-strikes to inflict further damage on the base camp of his primary target, the 271st Regiment. That evening Brigadier General William Coleman and other senior officers of the 1st Infantry Division visited the 2nd Battalion's camp, where they praised Allen's men for their efforts, and presented First Lieutenant Clark Welch—commander of Delta Company—with a Silver Star for his actions earlier in the day. Allen then decided to launch a full-frontal attack against the 271st Regiment's base camp, {{to determine if the}} enemy unit was still there. However, {{due to the lack of}} sufficient manpower, Welch suggested that Allen should either call off the assault or get more soldiers on the ground for the operation. Allen dismissed Welch's suggestions, <b>and</b> <b>responded</b> by giving Captain James George—commander of Alpha Company—the responsibility of leading the attack instead of Welch.|$|E
5|$|Most historians {{share the}} view that the militants {{escalated}} the conflict toward violence on the basis of false information transmitted by duplicitous individuals or groups attempting to neutralize the nationalist influence. Members of VVS and Jiny involved in the initial attacks have stated that their organizations were obliged to attack after the signal to take action was transmitted to them by a group that was later discovered to have secret ties to the national police. Researchers have documented reports of nationalists whose member organizations joined the conflict upon commands issued by the police, British nationals, and French settlers living in Madagascar. Despite the role of the militants in leading the uprising, the colonial authorities immediately held MDRM responsible for the movement <b>and</b> <b>responded</b> by targeting the party's members and supporters.|$|E
5|$|Munnerlyn started 14 {{games at}} right cornerback for the Panthers {{in his third}} season with the team <b>and</b> <b>responded</b> with a then career-high 58 tackles {{to go along with}} two sacks, one quarterback pressure, one forced fumble, one fumble {{recovery}} and seven passes defensed. He also accounted for six special teams tackles. In Week 5 at New Orleans Saints on October 9, he registered his first career sack, dropping quarterback Drew Brees for a six-yard loss on a blitz. In a Week 8 game against the Minnesota Vikings, he got his second sack of the season when he tackled Christian Ponder for a one-yard loss after he scrambled to the right to escape from pressure. Later in the game, he also stripped and recovered a fumble by Vikings wide receiver Percy Harvin a yard shy of the endzone. In Week 15, he suffered a strained left hamstring at Houston and was therefore placed on injured reserve on December 23.|$|E
