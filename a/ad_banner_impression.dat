It has become a popular means to {{determine}} the success of display media but often underestimates brand impact, suffers from significant biases and can often be manipulated through fraud. However, not all <b>banner</b> <b>ad</b> <b>impressions</b> realize a benefit. Some ad impressions are never seen, some are seen and clicked while others are seen and while never clicked realize a subsequent response - this post-exposure behavior is viewthrough.|$|R

40|$|The web as {{an arena}} for news {{reporting}} and information sharing to consumers has grown {{for many years}} in the expense of the traditional newspapers. The revenue stream has however not followed the same transformation which has led to a remarkably lower profit when news and articles are distributed through the web. Banner advertising is a method that is commonly used by online magazines to generate profit where advertisers pay to expose their message. One method to measure <b>banner</b> <b>ads</b> effectivity, and indirectly, what the advertiser would pay, is through Click-Through Rate (CTR), how many clicks a <b>banner</b> <b>ad</b> receives in relation to the amount of banner views. One of the variables that {{play an important role in}} the <b>banner</b> <b>ad</b> effectivity is the placement of the <b>banner</b> <b>ad.</b> This study has investigated if CTR is affected depending on the <b>banner</b> <b>ad</b> placement. The click- and view tracking has been measured by the amount of click and views every tested <b>banner</b> <b>ad</b> received. The results of the measurement show that the both placement have received an equal CTR. This study shows that common believes regarding <b>banner</b> <b>ad</b> placement could be wrong and that the placement of <b>banner</b> <b>ads</b> needs to be evaluated continuously in relation to several variables to keep the effectivity of the <b>banner</b> <b>ad.</b> This study’s limited extent underlines that further research needs to be done to draw a complete conclusion and support the findings. ...|$|R
40|$|Programmers can {{distribute}} {{new software}} to online users either {{for a fee}} as shareware or bundle it with advertising banners and distribute it for free as adware. In this paper we study the programmers' choice between these two modes of distribution {{in the context of}} a model that take explicit account of the strategic interaction between programmers who develop software, firms that advertise their products through <b>ad</b> <b>banners,</b> and consumers who buy software and consumer products. Adware allows advertisers to send targeted information to specific consumers and may therefore improve their purchasing decisions. At the same time, adware also raises privacy concerns. We study the effect of programmers' choice between shareware and adware on consumers' welfare through its effect on the beneficial information that consumers receive about consumers products on the one hand and their loss of privacy on the other hand. We also examine the implications of improvements in the technology of <b>ad</b> <b>banners</b> and the desirability of bans on the use of adware. ...|$|R

[...] "This baffled American analyst: How could this <b>banner</b> <b>ad,</b> which contained only an odd picture and the Ford logo, convince anyone that Ford is a safe car?" [...] Digging further, Briggs learned that simultaneously, TV, print and outdoor campaign featured the same person blowing bubble gum, and explaining the safety features, including airbags. The exposure to the online advertising, Briggs concluded, was reinforcing the messaging already received in other media.|$|R

The <b>banner</b> <b>ad</b> was also unique, as compared to advertising appearing in then comparable media, such as newspapers and magazines. Unlike advertising in periodicals, the <b>banner</b> <b>ad</b> encouraged media consumers to actually leave the media service or product and go to a separate media environment (typically a Web site operated by the advertiser). In contrast, readers viewing newspaper or magazine advertising are not encouraged to leave the periodical. Rather, the message of the advertising is itself intended to influence the reader.|$|R
