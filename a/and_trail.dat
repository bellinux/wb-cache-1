Trespassers are subjected to citations if caught.|$|E
5|$|Missouri Fox Trotters {{are used}} {{extensively}} by trail riders, who appreciate their gaits, stamina and weight-carrying abilities. They {{are also used}} in handicapped riding programs, and their smooth gait has proven useful for riders with minor physical disabilities. Crosses between Fox Trotter mares and donkey jacks are often made, creating mules with the fox trot gait {{that are used to}} carry hunters <b>and</b> <b>trail</b> riders, especially in the western United States. The US Forest Service also employs Fox Trotters for their speed, stamina and gait, and members of the breed were used to make the first horse-back descent of the north rim of the Grand Canyon.|$|E
40|$|Behavior {{of leading}} <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> arcs in twin-wire {{submerged}} arc welding has been investigated with help of transient heat transfer analysis. An appropriate heat transfer model with dissimilar heat sources at leading <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> arcs has been considered. The model has been simulated with different combinations of model parameters. Computed and experimentally measured temperatures have been compared and geometrical and heat distribution differences between leading <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> heat sources have been suggested. The behavior of leading <b>and</b> <b>trailing</b> arcs along with comparison between the current and the conventional approach has been presented and discussed. The simulation indicates that the leading arc has a major share in producing penetration where as the trailing arc is more responsible for melting. Copyright Â© Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

5|$|The Spotted Saddle Horse {{developed}} from small gaited pinto ponies of Spanish ancestry. These were crossed with larger American breeds {{such as the}} Morgan and Standardbred, developed after the American Revolution, to increase size while retaining coloration and the desired gait. After the American Civil War, additional gaited blood was added, with contributing breeds including the Tennessee Walking Horse, Missouri Fox Trotter, Paso Fino and Peruvian Paso. Mustangs from the American West were also incorporated. Originally developed in central Tennessee, and selectively bred for pinto coloration, they were used for general pleasure <b>and</b> <b>trail</b> riding.|$|E
5|$|The, Tennessee Walking Horse or Tennessee Walker is a {{breed of}} gaited horse {{known for its}} unique four-beat running-walk and flashy movement. It was {{originally}} developed in the southern United States for use on farms and plantations. It is a popular riding horse due to its calm disposition, smooth gaits and sure-footedness. The Tennessee Walking Horse is often seen in the show ring, but is also popular as a pleasure <b>and</b> <b>trail</b> riding horse using both English and Western equipment. Tennessee Walkers are also seen in movies, television shows and other performances.|$|E

An allocation of heavy water was used by the Chalk River Laboratories to build ZEEP under Kowarski's direction, which went critical in September 1945. This was followed by its NRX rector in 1947, which was also moderated by heavy water. Like CP-3 and ZEEP it was used for scientific research, and not for plutonium production.|$|E

5|$|The Spotted Saddle Horse is a horse breed {{from the}} United States that was {{developed}} by crossing Spanish-American type gaited pinto ponies with gaited horse breeds, such as the Tennessee Walking Horse. The result was a colorful, smooth-gaited horse, used in the show ring and for pleasure <b>and</b> <b>trail</b> riding. Two registries have been created for the breed, one in 1979 {{and the other in}} 1985. The two have similar registration requirements, although one has an open stud book and the other is slightly more strict with regard to parentage requirements, having a semi-closed stud book. The Spotted Saddle Horse is a light riding horse, always pinto in color. Solid-colored foals from registered parents may be registered for identification purposes, so their pinto-colored foals have documented parentage. They always perform an ambling gait, rather than a trot, in addition to the gaits of walk and canter, performed by all breeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{footpath}} {{users in the}} more popular walking areas in the Peak District has contributed to serious erosion problems, particularly on the fragile peat moorlands of the Dark Peak. The recent use of some paths by mountain bikers is believed by some to have exacerbated an existing problem. Measures taken to contain the damage have included the permanent diversion of the official route of the Pennine Way out of Edale, which now goes up Jacob's Ladder rather than following the Grindsbrook, and the surfacing of many moorland footpaths with expensive natural stone paving. Certain rights of way have been damaged by legal and illegal use by off-road vehicles such as 4×4s <b>and</b> <b>trail</b> bikes, which campaigners have sought to reduce.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Who Framed Roger Rabbit rekindled an {{interest}} in the Golden Age of American animation, and sparked the modern animation scene. In 1991, Walt Disney Imagineering began to develop Mickey's Toontown for Disneyland, based on the Toontown that appeared in the film. The attraction also features a ride called Roger Rabbit's Car Toon Spin. Three theatrical animated shorts were also produced; Tummy Trouble played in front of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Roller Coaster Rabbit was shown with Dick Tracy <b>and</b> <b>Trail</b> Mix-Up was included with A Far Off Place. The film also inspired a short-lived comic book and video game spin-offs, including two PC games, the Japanese version of The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle (which features Roger instead of Bugs), a 1989 game released on the Nintendo Entertainment System, and a 1991 game released on the Game Boy.|$|E
