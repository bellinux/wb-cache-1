30|$|A new finding {{compared}} to published studies {{was the number}} of catheters <b>and</b> <b>drainages</b> per patient prior to the diagnosis of BSI as another independent predictor of new-onset delirium. At first glance, the odds ratio of 1.14 for delirium by the number of catheters <b>and</b> <b>drainages</b> may seem small. However, it has {{to be taken into account}} that they are given for each additional catheter or drainage. Hence, the odds for delirium increases for example with two additional catheters by 28 %. Given the inherent limitations of observational data, we attempted to overcome confounding by including all variables known or assumed to impact the emergence of delirium and characteristics differing significantly different between delirious and non-delirious patients in our cohort into the multivariable models. Therefore, the SAPS II score and transient episodes of coma [26] prior to BSI diagnosis were included in our multivariable models. Three different stepwise model selection techniques were applied, all yielding identical results, underlining the robustness of our results. We acknowledge that the association between the number of catheters <b>and</b> <b>drainages</b> <b>and</b> delirium identified in our cohort may still be confounded by unmeasured variables associated with both the use of catheters <b>and</b> <b>drainages</b> <b>and</b> delirium. Our result is, however, supported by other studies identifying use of physical restraints as an important risk factor for the development of delirium [31]. Catheters <b>and</b> <b>drainages</b> preclude mobilization <b>and</b> have been associated with delirium in cardiac surgery patients [32]. Use of restraint was identified as a risk factor for delirium in mechanically ventilated patients [33] and in a multicenter study of ICU patients, which, however, could not assess its independent predictive value [34]. In our cohort, the use of lines was related to delirium despite the fact that all patients were subjected to a systemic inflammatory response triggered by bacteremia—another important contributor to delirium—underscoring its independent contribution.|$|R

5|$|Across its path, Bingiza {{destroyed}} 25,464houses {{and damaged}} 36schools. Overall, {{the damage was}} less than expected, given {{the strength of the}} cyclone. Most of the damage occurred due to the poor infrastructure <b>and</b> <b>drainage</b> systems of Madagascar, along with high levels of poverty. A total of 34deaths were reported, along with 13injuries. When Bingiza made its final landfall, it produced five days of rainfall to a region already severely affected by flooding. In Vangaindrano district in southeastern Madagascar, the cyclone caused widespread flooding that isolated five villages, as well as covering fields of rice and other crops. A total of 310people in the southern portion of the country were left homeless.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, the {{commission}} submitted a threefold plan of {{proposal to the}} government. First, the immediate dangers should be avoided by resetting the corners, removing stones that endangered the adjacent parts, strengthening the first balustrades and restoring several niches, archways, stupas and the main dome. Second, after fencing off the courtyards, proper maintenance should be provided <b>and</b> <b>drainage</b> should be improved by restoring floors and spouts. Third, all loose stones should be removed, the monument cleared {{up to the first}} balustrades, disfigured stones removed and the main dome restored. The total cost was estimated at that time around 48,800 Dutch guilders.|$|E

5|$|OTA began filing {{condemnation}} {{suits for}} homes within the Creek Turnpike's proposed right-of-way on June 30, 1989. Condemnation, {{the process by}} which a government exercises its powers of eminent domain, was required for OTA to seize properties necessary for the project when owners refused OTA buyout offers. Bids were opened for Creek Turnpike construction projects that November. Contracts for utility relocation, grading, <b>and</b> <b>drainage</b> work were awarded at OTA's November 16 meeting. Meanwhile, work began on the condemned properties, with contractors moving or demolishing houses on the affected lots from December 1989 to January 1990.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, 2012, NYSDOT {{announced}} {{a project to}} reconstruct NY149 and its junction with US4 in Fort Ann.

5|$|The {{river is}} a {{highland}} carrier, {{as it is}} embanked and the water level is often higher than the land through which it flows. Water from the surrounding countryside does not therefore drain into the river naturally, <b>and</b> <b>drainage</b> schemes have relied on pumping to remove the water. The pumping station at Westonzoyland was built in 1830, the first mechanical pumping station on the Somerset Levels. It was designed to drain the area around Westonzoyland, Middlezoy and Othery, {{and the success of}} the drainage system {{led to the formation of}} Internal drainage boards and the construction of other pumping stations.|$|E
5|$|Thus, {{the route}} chosen {{was a direct}} line between Saugus and Gorman, {{over the top of}} the ridge for many miles. Due to cost <b>and</b> <b>drainage</b> concerns, and a desire to reduce {{altering}} the terrain, the road was built with 697curves, high in the mountains. Construction on the Ridge Route, officially considered to run from Castaic Junction (west of Saugus on the road to Ventura) to the bottom of the grade at Grapevine, began in 1914. The highway was one of the earliest projects completed by the California Highway Commission. To construct the road, horse-drawn scrapers were used.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Srimanthudu, police {{officers}} and district level officers adopted 523 and 606 panchayats, respectively, in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, which Deccan Herald called a feat that India's prime minister Narendra Modi Saansad Adarsh Gram scheme had failed to do. Actors, bureaucrats, and politicians also announced plans to develop the backward villages. Mahesh adopted his father Krishna native village Burripalem, a minor panchayat in Tenali, and announced a plan to address basic {{needs of the community}} such as potable drinking water and better roads <b>and</b> <b>drainage</b> systems. After discussing with Telangana's then Rural Development minister K. T. Rama Rao, Mahesh decided to adopt Siddhapuram, a village in Mahabubnagar district.

30|$|The {{results of}} our study and the {{examples}} of pathophysiologic aspects outlined above suggest a direct pathomechanistic link between BSI, systemic inflammatory response and acute brain dysfunction expressed as delirium, calling for heightened awareness for new-onset delirium in critically ill patients with BSI. The number of catheters <b>and</b> <b>drainages</b> in ICU patients may constitute a useful and readily available predictor of delirium in patients with BSI allowing to identify patients at high risk. Furthermore, the number of catheters <b>and</b> <b>drainages</b> represents a potential target {{in the prevention of}} delirium, as it seems the number of insertion sites is modifiable and likely to further drive delirium in ICU patients. While catheters <b>and</b> <b>drainages</b> are inserted for specific indications and therefore cannot be omitted in most cases, our findings suggest that emphasis should be placed on removing such accesses as soon as possible not only for prevention of catheter-related infections but also for prevention of delirium. In addition, the use of multi-lumen catheters with the aim of reducing the number of insertion sites may be an important consideration in patients at high risk for delirium.|$|R
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{population}} density of Varanasi and {{the increasing number of}} tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and pressures on infrastructure in the city, mainly the sewage, sanitation, <b>and</b> <b>drainage</b> components. Pollution of the Ganges is a particular source of worry because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it as a source of drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself. The sewage problem is exacerbated by the role of the Ganges in bathing and in river traffic, which is very difficult to control. Because of the sewage, people using local untreated water have higher risk of contracting a range of water-borne stomach diseases.|$|E
5|$|In 1867 the {{formerly}} independent Hammersmith and City Railway was {{absorbed by the}} Metropolitan Railway and the Great Western Railway, and was operated from then on by Metropolitan Railway trains. The plan for a terminus in Fulham was abandoned, and the line instead turned west at Hammersmith to run over London and South Western Railway tracks to Richmond. Although Wandsworth Town railway station, near {{the southern end of}} the bridge, had provided direct connections to central London since 1846, the lack of rail connections opening on the north bank meant the area on the Fulham side remained undeveloped, and bridge usage was low. Tolmé's design was not sturdy enough to carry heavy vehicles, <b>and</b> <b>drainage</b> problems on the approach road to the north discouraged vehicles from using Wandsworth Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The brown honeyeater is {{seasonally}} nomadic {{across its}} local area {{in response to}} flowering food plants. For example, there are marked increases in numbers in Toowoomba in south-east Queensland during winter, and in the Northern Territory the range contracts during the dry season. It is commonly found among mangroves in coastal areas including black mangroves (Rhizophora mucronata). It is often in woodlands that merge into the mangroves, such as those dominated by Banksia, Melaleuca or Callistemon, and widespread in sclerophyll forests and eucalypt woodlands. In the arid and semi-arid inland of Australia it is most often recorded in Acacia, Grevillea and Hakea shrubland along watercourses, and at bores, springs <b>and</b> <b>drainage</b> lines. It visits flowering shrubs in parks and gardens, and occurs in remnant patches of trees on travelling stock routes.|$|E
