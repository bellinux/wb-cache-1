5|$|He and Doctor Phlox then tend to Porthos, and Archer {{spends the}} night in Sickbay {{to be with his}} pet. Throughout the night, as Porthos' immune system weakens, Archer {{experiences}} Phlox's side of life in Sickbay. During the night, as he dreams of Porthos' funeral, Archer also deals with unresolved and suppressed sexual tension with T'Pol. He also relates to Phlox how he met Porthos, and how he was the last in a litter of four male puppies, the 'Four Musketeers'. Through it all, Archer struggles to reach an emotional understanding with Phlox and T'Pol, as the two alien senior-crew members have little grasp of the human-pet relationship, and Phlox keeps offering Archer unsolicited advice <b>about</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> his apparent feelings for T'Pol.|$|E
5|$|After the war Blamey was Deputy Chief of the General Staff, and was {{involved}} {{in the creation of the}} Royal Australian Air Force. He resigned from the regular Army in 1925 to become Chief Commissioner of the Victoria Police, but remained in the Militia, rising to command the 3rd Division in 1931. As chief commissioner, Blamey set <b>about</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> the grievances that had led to the 1923 Victorian Police strike, and implemented innovations such as police dogs and equipping vehicles with radios. His tenure as chief commissioner was marred by a scandal in which his police badge was found in a brothel, and a later attempt to cover up the shooting of a police officer led to his forced resignation in 1936. He later made weekly broadcasts on international affairs on Melbourne radio station 3UZ. Appointed chairman of the Commonwealth Government's Manpower Committee and controller general of recruiting in 1938, he headed a successful recruiting campaign which doubled the size of the part-time volunteer Militia.|$|E

Leading cricket historian David Frith wrote: [...] "Meckiff was a popular Australian, and won much sympathy among those who believed him innocent or to have been victimised in a 'clean-up campaign'." [...] A dinner hosted by Don Bradman at his Adelaide home in January 1963 for visiting state captains was later cited to suggest that Meckiff {{may have been a}} sacrificial offering. At the dinner, attended by Bill Lawry of Victoria, Barry Shepherd, Ken Mackay and Benaud, Bradman had showed frame-by-frame slow motion film of Meckiff and other suspect Australian bowlers, which purportedly depicted incriminating actions.

Entertainment Weeklys Matt Diehl calls Method Man's and Redman's lyrics [...] "misogynistic", {{adding that it}} upsets Voodoos [...] "organically sensual vibe". The introspective track [...] "The Line" [...] has a downtempo, spiritual sound with lyrics <b>about</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> some unnamed adversity.

Music critic Robert Christgau interpreted the lyrics to be [...] "unjudgmental, unsentimental ... in which a young black man lays out the reasons he's ready to die-leaving the listener to wonder why the fuck he should have to think about it". Andy Peterson of The GW Hatchet viewed that the adversity is [...] "the price of fame" [...] or [...] "lamenting a lost lover".|$|E

They also have certain misconceptions <b>about</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> the disease.

500|$|Although Barrowclough {{arrived in}} New Caledonia with his divisional {{headquarters}} in November 1942, {{the main body}} of his command was not in place until January 1943. Once on the island, his division began training in amphibious landings and jungle warfare to prepare it for forthcoming offensive operations while he set <b>about</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> the administrative and logistical problems of integrating the division into the American command structure. The 3rd Division was a division in name only, consisting of two infantry brigades [...] the 8th and 14th [...] instead of the three of a conventional infantry division, and he unsuccessfully agitated for expansion. New Zealand could not supply enough manpower to have two full infantry divisions in the field, and the government's preference was to retain the 2nd New Zealand Division, still in North Africa, at full strength. Barrowclough was unhappy at this decision and his relationship with Army headquarters in Wellington and its Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Edward Puttick, became strained. The two brigade divisional structure also constrained how the 3rd Division could be employed in offensive operations, as it could not be used as a replacement for an American division due to its reduced number of personnel. Being the only unit in the South Pacific Area outside of the American supply chain also caused logistical problems as the division used British equipment.|$|E
500|$|According to Saadiq, [...] "Just One Kiss" [...] can be {{interpreted}} as a song devoted to a female love interest, [...] "but I'm really talking about music and what it did for me. That one guitar line, that certain drum beat, how it turned my life into a ball of gold." [...] The song incorporates cinematic strings, xylophone, and a rolling crescendo. The ballad [...] "Calling", featuring Mexican balladeer Rocio Mendoza, draws on Motown's late 1950s R roots and doo-wop music, and incorporates Latin style guitar, and Spanish language lyrics. [...] "Staying in Love", an uptempo rhythm and blues song, was written by Saadiq after he thought of an ex-girlfriend. Incongruous with its 1960s-inspired sound, [...] "Let's Take a Walk" [...] has sexually forward lyrics and , which the narrator uses to bluntly proposition his love interest. The midtempo [...] "Never Give You Up" [...] is fashioned in Motown's early 1970 sound and, unlike other songs on the album, also incorporates elements from more modern soul music. [...] "Sometimes", which was inspired by Saadiq's upbringing in a tough neighborhood in Oakland, is <b>about</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> the fatigue of universal hardships when they are worsened by the burden of racism. The line [...] "now I know what they meant by 'keep your head to the sky'" [...] makes reference to Earth, Wind & Fire, whose music Saadiq immersed himself in while growing up. Saadiq said of the song's message, [...] "That's just giving dap to my moms and grandmother and the people who raised me in the neighborhood to let them know its easy but not as easy as it seems all the time and sometimes we have to back up and cry but I'm just giving thanks to the people that helped me along the way." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{cornerstone}} of mid-1990s emo was Weezer's 1996 album, Pinkerton. After {{the success of}} their multi-platinum debut, Pinkerton moved from the multi-platinum debut's sound to a darker, more-abrasive sound. Frontman Rivers Cuomo's songs focused on messy, manipulative sex and his insecurity <b>about</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> celebrity. A critical and commercial failure, Rolling Stone called it the second-worst album of the year. Cuomo retreated from the public eye, later referring to the album as [...] "hideous" [...] and [...] "a hugely painful mistake". However, Pinkerton found enduring appeal with young people who were discovering alternative rock and identified with its confessional lyrics and theme of rejection. Sales grew steadily due to word of mouth, online message boards and Napster. [...] "Although no one was paying attention", writes Greenwald, [...] "perhaps because no one was paying attention—Pinkerton became the most important emo album of the decade." ...|$|E

2500|$|On health, UKIP's {{policy is}} to keep the National Health Service and general {{practitioner}} visits free at the point of use for UK citizens. Non-citizens would be required to have approved medical insurance [...] "as a condition of entering the UK". In 2015, Farage attracted widespread press attention for suggesting that HIV positive patients who were not UK citizens should not receive treatment on the NHS. In that same speech he stated that the UK should put the NHS [...] "there for British people and families, who in many cases have paid into the system for years". Farage has spoken in favour of an insurance-based system in the past, which he said would resemble the French and Dutch style system rather than an American style private system, but this was rejected by the party. He has commented, [...] "we may have to think about ways in the future <b>about</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> health care differently". Critics of UKIP have claimed that the party's real desire is to dismantle and privatise the NHS, a claim bolstered by the publication of leaked documents showing that in 2013 the UKIP NEC privately spoke positively of NHS privatisation.|$|E
