40|$|AIM:To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} phagocytic load on apoptosis of cultured <b>aged</b> <b>bovine</b> retinal pigment epithelium(RPE) cells. METHODS: The third generation of cultured <b>aged</b> <b>bovine</b> RPE cells was cultured respectively with culture medium, containing 200 μg/mL photoreceptor outer segment(POS) and 400 μg/mL POS. Then the apoptosis rates of RPE cells after 24, 48 and 96 h were detected with flow cytometry instrument(AnnexinⅤ/PI double staining). RESULTS: In blank control group, the apoptosis rates were very low at different time. After RPE cells were cultured with culture medium containing 200 μg/mL POS for 24 h, the apoptosis rate including early apoptosis and late apoptosis was 1. 73 %. As time going, the apoptosis rate increased rapidly and reached 65. 92 % after 96 h. After RPE cells were cultured with culture medium containing 400 μg/mL POS for 24 h, the apoptosis rate was 4. 02 %. And it reached 91. 34 % significantly after 96 h.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the C-terminal region of alpha-A crystallin is susceptible to age-dependent, posttranslational modification. To quantitate the amount of modification, alpha-A crystallin was purified from total proteins of the <b>aging</b> <b>bovine</b> lens, then digested with lys-C endoproteinase. Reverse phase, high pressure liquid chromatography was used to resolve and quantitate the resulting peptides, to determine the amount of C-terminal peptide relative to peptides from other regions of the protein that have not been reported to undergo modification. The results indicate that relative to alpha-A crystallin from newborn lens, posttranslational modification has occurred in approximately 45 - 55 % of the C-terminal region from mature lens. These results demonstrate extensive modification of the C-terminal region of alpha-A crystallin from the mature lens, indicating that during the aging process, posttranslational modifications in this region may make significant contributions to the aggregated state and/or molecular chaperone properties of the molecule...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that in vitro, alpha-crystallin can protect other lens proteins against extensive denaturation and aggregation.

Negative staining of this preparation revealed the presence of particles of 13 - 14 nm diameter, characteristic of alpha-crystallin. Immunolocalization of the same particles using antiserum specific for gamma- and beta-crystallins demonstrated preferential binding of these crystallins to the central region of the alpha-crystallin complex.

40|$|The high {{molecular}} weight aggregate (HMWA) fraction was isolated from the water soluble proteins of <b>aged</b> <b>bovine</b> lenses. Its composition and ability to inhibit heat-induced denaturation and aggregation were compared with the lower molecular weight, oligomeric fraction of alpha isolated from the same lens. Although the major components of both fractions were the alpha-A and alpha-B chains, the HMWA fraction possessed a decreased ability to protect other proteins against heat-induced denaturation and aggregation. Immunoelectron microscopy of both fractions demonstrated that alpha particles from the HMWA fraction contained increased amounts of beta and gamma crystallins, bound to a central region of the supramolecular complex. Together, these results demonstrate that alpha crystallins found in the HMWA fraction possess a decreased ability to protect against heat-induced denaturation and aggregation, and suggest that {{at least part of}} this decrease could be due to the increased presence of beta and gamma crystallins complexed to the putative chaperone receptor site of the alpha particles...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to clarify the aging-related changes in in vitro-matured bovine oocytes. Firstly, we examined the fertilization and embryonic development of bovine oocytes after 22 and 30 - 34 h of in vitro maturation (IVM). The oocytes after 30 - 34 h of IVM (penetrated by sperm at around 40 h after starting IVM) showed a lower developmental rate to blastocysts (P< 0. 01), although normal fertilization rates were similar regardless of IVM duration. In the next experiment, reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial activity and ATP content in oocytes after 20, 30 and 40 h of IVM were examined. The lowest level of ROS was found in the group subjected to 30 h of IVM. The mitochondrial activity and ATP content in the group subjected to 40 h of IVM were higher than in the group subjected to 20 h of IVM (P< 0. 01), and those in the group subjected to 30 h of IVM showed intermediate values. Thereafter, the mitochondrial activities at 3 days after in vitro fertilization in embryos derived from the oocytes subjected to 22 and 34 h of IVM were evaluated. In the group subjected to 34 h of IVM, high-polarized mitochondria were frequently observed at the periphery of blastomeres. The present results suggest that high mitochondrial activity observed in oocytes after prolonged IVM culture and localization of high-polarized mitochondria at the periphery of blastomeres during early embryonic development may be associated with the low developmental competence in <b>aged</b> <b>bovine</b> oocytes...|$|E
40|$|Postmortem aging {{has been}} {{extensively}} practiced in the meat industry for decades due to its beneficial impact on improving eating quality attributes. However, prolonged postmortem aging may adversely impact color and/or lipid oxidation stabilities of meat, leading to decreased display shelf-life and increased rancid off-flavor. As physical/biochemical changes occur during postmortem aging, metabolites that impart antioxidant or pro-oxidant activities are generated or consumed, which {{could be related to}} the oxidation stabilities of postmortem muscles with aging. However, the underlying mechanism of the aging-induced oxidation susceptibility has not been fully established. Therefore, the overall objective of this thesis was to understand the effect of postmortem aging on oxidation related metabolites in different bovine muscles. ^ The first chapter of this thesis is the literature review, and the second chapter focuses on determining the effect of postmortem aging on color and lipid oxidation stabilities in different bovine muscles. Three muscles, longissimus lumborum (LL), semimembranosus (SM), and psoas major (PM) were chosen (n= 7) for the study due to the distinct features in muscle fiber composition, oxidation stabilities, and metabolic properties of those muscles. At 1 -day postmortem, the three muscles were separated from 7 beef carcasses, divided into 3 sections, vacuum-packaged, and assigned to 9, 16, and 23 days of aging. After each aging time, steaks made from each sections were overwrap PVC-packaged and displayed for 7 days. Instrumental and sensory color characteristics were measured. Lipid oxidation by measuring TBARS and conjugated dienes (CD), myoglobin content, and non-heme iron contents were determined. Intensified discoloration and decreased redness of meat were observed with prolonged aging, where LL was the most color-stable followed by SM and PM (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Lipid oxidation increased with aging, and LL was more oxidative stable (lower TBARS and CD) compared to SM and PM. Lower myoglobin and non-heme iron contents were observed in LL compared to SM and PM (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). A significant increase in non-heme iron contents during aging was found. The results of the current study indicate that color and lipid oxidation stability could be negatively associated with aging, and different muscles have different susceptibilities to oxidation. This observation suggests that developing a post-harvest aging strategy to track optimal aging times for different muscles would be beneficial for the meat industry to minimize the oxidation-related quality defects while maintaining consistent eating attributes. ^ The third chapter of this thesis was a study to identify key metabolites that could be associated with oxidation stabilities of <b>aged</b> <b>bovine</b> muscles using metabolomics approach. Selected raw samples (n= 4; at day 0 of display of each aging) from the previous study (Chapter 2) were analyzed using the HPLC-ESI-MS metabolomics. The metabolomics data were analyzed using PCA and split-plot ANOVA. Spearman correlations between metabolites and oxidation related quality attributes were conducted using R software. The metabolomics platform detected 1012 compounds, among which 243 were significantly responsive to either aging or muscle treatments. Most distinct metabolites being identified were carnitines, free amino acids, nucleotides, vitamins /coenzymes, and glucuronides. NAD showed a positive correlation to the redness of meat color (r = 0. 672) and negative correlations to discoloration (r = - 0. 535), TBARS (r = - 0. 554), and non-heme iron (r = - 0. 667), indicating its relevance to myoglobin redox form stability and/or lipid oxidation stability. A group of carnitines that decreased with aging was associated with decreased redness (r = - 0. 67) and intensified discoloration (r = 0. 70), which may be explained by their roles in the mitochondria matrix and/or their potential antioxidant properties. Glucuronides increased with extended aging and associated with discoloration (r = 0. 56) and non-heme iron accumulation (r = 0. 65). Some nucleotides, nucleosides and free amino acids were more liberated with aging and positively correlated to chemical/phenotypic oxidation indicators. ^ The results from the current study suggest that some metabolites could be associated with oxidation stabilities of beef muscles. In particular, our study confirmed the relevance of the NAD/NADH system in myoglobin redox stability. Further, we identified potential compounds, such as carnitines and glucuronides, which could be related to color/lipid oxidation stabilities of aged beef muscles. The identified key metabolites should be further investigated to reveal the chemical basis of oxidation stabilities of beef muscle and could be validated into biomarkers for industry to track the quality development of beef during aging. ...|$|E

BackgroundAdvanced glycation end products (AGEs) are elevated in renal failure and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several uremic complications. Their formation is closely associated with oxidative stress. The recent observation that nitric oxide (NO) has an antioxidant effect led us to examine the possible role of NO in the generation of AGEs. MethodsWe examined the effect of NO donors, 2, 2 ′-(hydroxynitrosohydrazono) bis-ethanamine (NOC 18) and S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP), on the in vitro formation of pentosidine, which {{was used as a}} surrogate marker for <b>AGEs.</b> <b>Bovine</b> serum albumin was incubated under air at 37 °C in a medium containing either several AGE precursors or uremic plasma. To elucidate further the mechanism of the NO effect on AGE formation, we examined the generation of free radicals and carbonyls in pentose-driven pentosidine formation. ResultsNO donors significantly inhibit {{the formation of}} pentosidine in a dose-dependent manner. The effect is abolished by the addition of a NO scavenging agent, 2 -(4 -carboxyphenyl) - 4, 4, 5, 5 -tetramethylimidazoline- 1 -oxyl 3 -oxide (carboxy-PTIO). The inhibitory effect results from NO but not from the NO donor molecule. It is best explained by the ability of NO to scavenge carbon-centered radicals, hydroxyl radical, and carbonyl compounds. ConclusionsNO inhibits pentosidine formation by scavenging free radicals and by inhibiting carbonyl compound formation. NO might be implicated in the atherogenic and inflammatory effects of AGEs: Reduced NO production and increased oxidative stress associated with atherosclerotic lesions may accelerate AGE formation and, thus, exacerbate endothelial dysfunction and accelerate the development of atherosclerosis in uremia...|$|R

We have examined the immunolocalization of AGEs and AGE-R components R 1 and R 2 in the retinal vasculature at 2, 4, and 8 months after STZ-induced diabetes as well as in nondiabetic rats infused with <b>AGE</b> <b>bovine</b> serum albumin for 2 weeks. Using polyclonal or monoclonal anti-AGE antibodies and polyclonal antibodies to recombinant AGE-R 1 and AGE-R 2, immunoreactivity (IR) was examined in the complete retinal vascular tree after isolation by trypsin digestion. After 2, 4, and 8 months of diabetes, there was a gradual increase in AGE IR in basement membrane. At 8 months, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells of the retinal vessels showed dense intracellular AGE IR. AGE epitopes stained most intensely within pericytes and smooth muscle cells but less in basement membrane of AGE-infused rats compared with the diabetic group. Retinas from normal or bovine-serum-albumin-infused rats were largely negative for AGE IR. AGE-R 1 and -R 2 co-localized strongly with AGEs of vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells of either normal, diabetic, or AGE-infused rat retinas, and this distribution did not vary with each condition. The data indicate that AGEs accumulate as a function of diabetes duration first within the basement membrane and then intracellularly, co-localizing with cellular AGE-Rs. Significant AGE deposits appear within the pericytes after long-term diabetes or acute challenge with AGE infusion conditions associated with pericyte damage.

Because sugar or sugar-adduct autoxidation is critical for AGE formation in vitro, we evaluated the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in intracellular <b>AGE</b> formation, using <b>bovine</b> aortic endothelial cells. 30 mM glucose increased intracellular ROS formation by 250 % and lipid peroxidation by 330 %, while not affecting ROS in the media. In cells depleted of glutathione, intracellular AGE accumulation increased linearly with ROS generation as measured by immunoblotting and the fluorescent probe DCFH (AGE 0. 258 - 3. 531 AU* mm/ 5 x 10 (4) cells, DCF 57 - 149 mean AU, r =. 998, P <. 002). Deferoxamine, alpha-tocopherol, and dimethylsulfoxide each inhibited hyperglycemia-induced formation of both ROS and AGE.

40|$|Advanced {{glycosylation}} endproducts (AGEs), the glucose-derived adducts {{that form}} nonenzymatically and accumulate on tissue proteins, are implicated in many chronic complications associated with diabetes and aging. We have previously described a monocyte/macrophage surface receptor system thought to coordinate AGE protein removal and tissue remodeling, and purified a corresponding 90 -kD AGE-binding protein from the murine RAW 264. 7 cell line. To identify AGE-binding proteins in normal animals, the tissue distribution of 125 I-AGE rat serum albumin taken {{up from the}} blood was determined in rats in vivo. These uptake studies demonstrated that the liver was a major site of AGE protein sequestration. Using a solid-phase assay system involving the immobilization of solubilized membrane proteins onto nitrocellulose to monitor binding activity, and several purification steps including affinity chromatography over an <b>AGE</b> <b>bovine</b> serum albumin matrix, two rat liver membrane proteins were isolated that specifically bound AGEs, one migrating at 60 kD (p 60) and the other at 90 kD (p 90) on SDS-PAGE. NH 2 -terminal sequence analysis revealed no significant homology between these two proteins nor to any molecules available in sequence databases. Flow cytometric analyses using avian antibodies to purified rat p 60 and p 90 demonstrated that both proteins are present on rat monocytes and macrophages. Competition studies revealed no crossreactivity between the two antisera; anti-p 60 and anti-p 90 antisera prevented AGE-protein binding to rat macrophages when added alone or in combination. These results indicate that rat liver contains at least two novel and distinct proteins that recognize AGE-modified macromolecules, although p 90 {{may be related to}} the previously described 90 -kD AGE receptor isolated from RAW 264. 7 cells. The constitutive expression of AGE-binding proteins on rat monocytes and macrophages, and the sequestration of circulating AGE-modified proteins by the liver, provides further evidence in support of a role for these molecules in the normal removal of proteins marked as senescent by accumulated glucose-derived covalent addition products, or AGEs...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The Maillard {{reaction}} {{that leads to}} the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGE) {{plays an important role in}} the pathogenesis of angiopathy in diabetic patients and in the aging process. Recently, it was proposed that AGE were not only created by glucose, but also by dicarbonyl compounds derived from the Maillard reaction, autoxidation of sugars and other metabolic pathways of glucose. In this study, we developed four types of non-carboxymethyllysine (CML) anti-AGE antibodies that recognized proteins modified by incubation with short chain sugars and dicarbonyl compounds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AGE-modified serum albumins were prepared by incubation of rabbit serum albumin with glyceraldehyde, glycolaldehyde, methylglyoxal or glyoxal. After immunization of rabbits, four types of AGE-specific antisera were obtained that were specific for the AGE modification. To separate non-CML AGE antibodies (Ab) (non-CML AGE-Ab- 2, - 3, - 4, and - 5), these anti-AGE antisera were subjected to affinity chromatography on a matrix coupled with four kinds of <b>AGE</b> <b>bovine</b> serum albumin (BSA) or CML-BSA. These non-CML AGE antibodies were used to investigate the AGE content of serum obtained from diabetic patients on hemodialysis. RESULTS: Characterization of the four types of non-CML AGE antibodies obtained by immunoaffinity chromatography was performed by competitive ELISA and immunoblot analysis. Non-CML AGE-Ab- 2 crossreacted with the protein modified by glyceraldehyde or glycolaldehyde. Non-CML AGE-Ab- 3 and -Ab- 4 specifically cross-reacted with protein modified by glycolaldehyde and methylglyoxal, respectively. NonCML AGE-Ab- 5 cross-reacted with protein modified with glyoxal as well as methylglyoxal and glycolaldehyde. Three kinds of non-CML AGE (AGE- 2, - 4, and - 5) were detected in diabetic serum as three peaks with apparent molecular weights of 200, 1. 15, and 0. 85 kD; whereas, AGE- 3 was detected as two peaks with apparent molecular weights of 200 and 0. 85 kD. CONCLUSION: We propose that various types of non-CML AGE are formed by the Maillard reaction, sugar autoxidation and sugar metabolism. These antibodies enable us to identify such compounds created by the Maillard reaction in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative {{structural}} {{comparisons were}} made between keratan sulphates isolated from various sources, namely pig nucleus pulposus, bovine cornea, and the costal cartilages of children, {{a young adult}} with Marfan syndrome and of old human autopsies. In human costal cartilage the amount of keratan sulphate increases markedly with age, although total mucopolysaccharide decreases to some extent, concomitant with a decrease in chondroitin 4 -sulphate {{and an increase in}} chondroitin 6 -sulphate. Comparison of molecular weights estimated by gel chromatography with those calculated from the molar ratio of galactose to mannose indicates that keratan sulphates of human costal cartilages of children and of a young adult with Marfan syndrome, and of pig nucleus pulposus, contain one mannose residue per chain, whereas keratan sulphates of old human costal cartilage and of bovine cornea contain one to two, and two, per chain respectively. After mild acid-catalysed desulphation of pig nucleus pulposus keratan sulphate, approx. 12 % of the mucopolysaccharide aggregates irreversibly once the water is removed from the polysaccharide. The following conclusions have been drawn from a methylation analysis of keratan sulphates of various sources, aided by g. l. c. -mass spectrometry. (1) Fucose and N-acetylneuraminic acid are non-reducing terminal residues and the sialic acid is linked to the 3 -position of galactose residues. (2) Pig nucleus pulposus keratan sulphate has approximately 4 non-reducing terminal groups per molecule and appears to be slightly less branched than the costal-cartilage keratan sulphate of children.

PFE, fed with a high-fat and high-sucrose (HFS) diet to KK-Ay mice, significantly reduced glycation products such as glycoalbumin (22. 0 ± 2. 4 %), hemoglobin A 1 c (5. 84 ± 0. 23 %), and serum AGEs (8. 22 ± 0. 17 μg/mL), as compared to a control HFS group (30. 6 ± 2. 6 %, 7. 45 ± 0. 12 %, and 9. 55 ± 0. 17 μg/mL, respectively, P < 0. 05). In antiglycation assays, PFE, punicalin, punicalagin, ellagic acid, and gallic acid suppressed the formation of <b>AGEs</b> from <b>bovine</b> serum albumin and sugars. In this study, we discuss the mechanism of the antiglycation effects of PFE and its components in vivo and in vitro...|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the University of Wolverhampton for the degree of Master of PhilosophyPlatelets are known to {{play a key role in}} acute coronary events, such as myocardial infarction, associated with advanced atherosclerosis, but a number of papers have recently been published suggesting that platelet adhesion may initiate atherosclerotic lesion formation. The proposed research aimed to investigate this by seeing whether platelet adhesion occurred, directly or via leukocytes, to the endothelium in diabetic conditions. Diabetic-like conditions were chosen because an accelerated rate of lesion formation occurs. This was achieved by incubating endothelial cells with high concentrations of glucose and various types of <b>AGEs.</b> <b>Bovine</b> serum albumin of different purity, a peptide of albumin, and haemoglobin were glycated with D-glucose. Samples were taken at 2 weeks intervals to allow for determining the extent of glycation and allowing for investigation into whether the extent of glycation affected platelet adhesion. It also made possible analysis of extent of glycation, to see whether these have a relation to endothelial dysfunction (including cell proliferation, cell adhesion molecule expression, and ROS and cytokine production). There are discrepancies in the finding of studies looking into the effect of AGEs on the endothelium and there are no reported studies looking at cytokine production. As such, it was hoped that this research would allow for a greater understanding of the processes involved and whether endothelial dysfunction could account for accelerated lesion formation associated with diabetes. As a whole, the research intended to explore the hypothesis that platelet adhesion to the endothelium is required for foam cell formation and their development into atherosclerotic lesions. It aimed to see whether hyperglycaemia and the presence of high levels of AGEs induces endothelial dysfunction and therefore increases monocyte adhesion by the presence of activated platelets. In doing so, a greater understanding of the processes involved in accelerated lesion formation would allow for targeted research to allow for treatments to reduce foam cell deposition. This could be the use of a cocktail of anti-platelet drugs or ones that reduce endothelial dysfunction. This would reduce the manifestation of cardiovascular disease and therefore improve diabetic patient life as well as reduce the cost of treatment for the NHS, and therefore for the tax payer...|$|R
40|$|Bovine {{preimplantation}} embryos {{derived from}} nuclear transfer experiments exhibit a global state of genomic hypermethylation that likely {{account for the}} large number of developmental abnormalities observed to date. The central hypotheses of this work is that the genomic hypermethylation and improper epigenetic reprogramming reported in studies of bovine nuclear transfer, are in large part due to abnormal expression and regulation of the DNA methyltransferase proteins. Bovine Dnmt mRNAs display strong sequence homology to those of human and mouse and similar to other species, exist as multiple isoforms. Two of these splice variants, which have been termed Dnmt 2 &# 947; and Dnmt 3 a 4 represent previously unreported sequence combinations. Investigation of bovine DNA methyltransferase expression in the bovine oocyte and early preimplantation development has revealed an intricate system divergent from observations previously reported in the mouse. Specifically, the somatic version of Dnmt 1 along with Dnmt 2, 3 a and 3 b are all expressed during these initial stages of bovine development. Further, real time analyses of the Dnmt transcripts in cloned and in vitro produced embryos reveal significant differences in the mRNA expression levels of Dnmt 1 and 2 but not Dnmt 3 a and 3 b suggesting that the de novo methyltransferases may be functioning normally while Dnmt 1 and Dnmt 2 are aberrantly methylating the genome during a critical time when methylation levels should be receding. Real time PCR analysis of the Dnmt transcripts in fetal and adult tissues has revealed a developmental and tissue specific expression pattern suggesting that proper expression and function of these enzymes is a key element in the process of differentiation. These results are further supported by studies of Dnmt expression in <b>aging</b> <b>bovine</b> fibroblast cultures, which suggest that the Dnmts may play some as yet unidentified role in cellular senescence. Recently, it has been postulated that the cause of abnormal methylation observed in cloned embryos may be due in part to misexpression of the Dnmt 1 o isoform during preimplantation development. Work presented here raises new and significant hypotheses that must be considered both regarding the cadre of DNA methyltranferases that direct epigenetic programming during normal development and regarding the implication of abnormal DNMT expression in cloned embryos.

40|$|Abstract Background Plantago asiatica {{has been}} {{traditionally}} used for traditional medicine around East Asia. Plantamajoside (PM), which is isolated from this plant, {{is known for}} biological properties including anti-inflammation and antioxidant activity. To demonstrate the biological activity of PM against endothelial dysfunction induced by advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), a cellular inflammatory mechanism system was evaluated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Methods We obtained PM through previous research in our laboratory. We formed the <b>AGEs</b> from <b>bovine</b> serum albumin with glyceraldehyde {{in the dark for}} seven days. To confirm the modulation of the inflammatory mechanism in endothelial dysfunction, we quantified the various pro-inflammatory cytokines and endothelial dysfunction-related proteins in the HUVECs with Western blotting and with real-time and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions. Results Co-treatment with PM and AGEs significantly suppressed inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecule expression. Moreover, the PM treatment for down-regulated inflammatory signals and blocked monocyte adhesion on the HUVECs.

40|$|Background: Dietary plant-based foods contain {{combinations}} of various bioactive compounds such as phytochemical compounds and vitamins. The combined {{effect of these}} vitamins and phytochemicals remains unknown, especially {{in the prevention of}} diabetes and its complications. The present study aimed to investigate the combined effect of ascorbic acid and gallic acid on fructose-induced protein glycation and oxidation. Results: Ascorbic acid (15  μg/mL) and gallic acid (0. 1  μg/mL) reduced fructose-induced formation of advanced glycation end products (<b>AGEs)</b> in <b>bovine</b> serum albumin (BSA; 10  mg/mL) by 15. 06 % and 37. 83 %, respectively. The combination of ascorbic acid and gallic acid demonstrated additive inhibition on the formation of AGEs after 2  weeks of incubation. In addition, synergistic inhibition on the formation of amyloid cross-β structure and protein carbonyl content in fructose-glycated BSA was observed. At the same concentration, the combination of ascorbic acid and gallic acid produced a significant additive effect on the 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity. Conclusion: Combining natural compounds such as ascorbic acid and gallic acid seems to be a promising strategy to prevent the formation of AGEs...|$|R

In the present study, we {{determined}} the efficacy and possible mechanism of KIOM- 79 on the advanced glycation end product (<b>AGE)</b> -modified <b>bovine</b> serum albumin (BSA) -induced apoptosis of cultured bovine retinal pericytes and rat retinal pericytes in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Seven-week-old male ZDF rats {{were treated with}} KIOM- 79 (50 mg/kg body weight) once a day orally for 13 weeks. KIOM- 79 significantly inhibited pericyte apoptosis which were induced by the AGE-BSA treatment. The KIOM- 79 treatment markedly suppressed the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) through the inhibition of inhibitory kB kinase complex. In addition, the oral administration of KIOM- 79 inhibited the changes in retinal vasculature (vascular hyperpermeability, acellular capillary). KIOM- 79 strongly inhibited pericyte apoptosis, NF-kB activation and the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and tumor necrosis factor-a. Our results suggest that KIOM- 79 may exert inhibitory effects on AGE-induced pericyte apoptosis by blocking NF-kB activation, thereby ameliorating retinal microvascular dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Pigs {{living in}} {{commercial}} husbandry systems may experience both acute stress due to standard management procedures and chronic stress through limitations in their barren housing environment. This might influence their immune status, including antibody responses to neural and danger autoantigens. Levels of natural autoantibody (NAAb) -binding phosphorylcholine-conjugated bovine serum albumin (PC-BSA) and myelin basic protein (MBP) were measured {{over time in}} pigs that were kept in environmental enriched v. barren housing, and that underwent a regrouping test. In total, 480 pigs were housed in 80 pens in either barren or straw-enriched pens from 4 through 23 weeks of age. Blood samples were taken from pigs before (week 8), and 3 days after a 24 h regrouping test (week 9), and at 22 weeks of <b>age.</b> Phosphorylcholine-conjugated <b>bovine</b> serum albumin (PC-BSA) and MBP antibody titres in serum were measured using ELISA. Enriched-housed pigs had higher levels of IgM-binding MBP, and tended to {{have higher levels of}} IgG-binding MBP and IgA-binding PC-BSA than barren-housed pigs. Each NAAb measured in this study was affected by gender and litter. These results suggest that enriched housing conditions, as well as acute regrouping stress, have an influence on levels of serum NAAb-binding danger and neural antigens in pigs...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} whether increasing advanced glycation end products (<b>AGEs)</b> in <b>bovine</b> articular cartilage to levels present in aged human cartilage modulates the tensile biomechanical {{properties of the}} tissue. Methods. Adult bovine articular cartilage samples were incubated in a buffer solution with ribose to induce the formation of AGEs or in a control solution. Portions of cartilage samples were assayed for biochemical indices of AGEs and tested to assess their tensile biomechanical properties, including stiffness, strength, and elongation at failure. Results. Ribose treatment of cartilage induced increases in tissue fluorescence, absorbance, and pentosidine content (P < 0. 001 for each comparison) by amounts {{similar to those that}} occur during aging in humans. Ribose treatment of cartilage also induced an increase in dynamic modulus (60 % increase) and strength (35 % increase), and a decrease (25 % decrease) in strain (P < 0. 001 for each comparison). Conclusion. The concomitant increase in AGEs and alteration of tensile properties of cartilage after ribose treatment suggest that aging- associated changes in AGEs have functional consequences for this tissue. The AGE-associated increases in strength and stiffness of cartilage may be beneficial by counteracting the decreases in these properties that are associated with degeneration. Conversely, the AGE-associated decrease in failure length, or increase in brittleness, together with increased stiffness may predispose cartilage to increased stress concentration, fracture, and aging-associated biomechanical dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Prion {{pathogenesis}} following oral {{exposure is}} thought to involve gut-associated lymphoid tissue, which includes Peyer’s patches (PP). Before neuroinvasion, early accumulation of infectious prion protein (PrPsc) takes place on follicular dendritic cells (FDC) which are resident cells in germinal centres. The strain, the infection pathway and the lesions in {{the central nervous system}} are similar between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and variant Creutzfeldt Jakob diseases. But in BSE, the agent tropism differs from lymphoid organs. Only bovine ileal PP are infectious. In order to study the replication and the possible ways of neuroinvasion of PrPsc in bovine PP, we studies the expression of cellular prion protein (PrPc), necessary for PrPsc accumulation, and compared the innervation of germinal centres related to FDC on ileal and jejunal PP of cows and calves. We performed classical immunoperoxydase staining and double immunofluorescence staining analyzed with a confocal microscopy. Differences in the innervation of germinal centres and expression of PrPc were evident. More contacts between FDC and nerve fibres are observed in calves PP. PrPc expression, carried out with different anti-PrPc antibodies, highlighted a heterogeneous labelling between calves and cows PP. Such results permit us to show that the innervation of PP is a dynamic process which could influence the first way of neuroinvasion in prion diseases. Moreover differences in the affinity of some antibody for PrPc allow us to postulate that PrPc glycoforms differ with <b>age</b> of <b>bovines</b> and thus could interfere with PrPsc tropism.

Pedigree information from animals born in the period between 1965 and 2006 and weight-adjusted data at 205 (W 205), 365 (W 365) and 550 (W 550) days of <b>age</b> for <b>bovines</b> born between 1975 and 2006 were used. The (co) variance components and genetic value were estimated using the application MTDFREML. Also, the software ENDOG was used for pedigree analysis and parameter estimation based on the probabilities of gene origin, inbreeding and average generation interval. The heritability coefficients for direct genetic effects were 0. 21 ± 0. 03, 0. 26 ± 0. 04 and 0. 36 ± 0. 05 for W 205, W 365 and W 550, respectively. During the first 20 years studied, the observed effective size was small. The generation intervals by gametic pathway were: 7. 7 ± 3. 4 (sire-son), 7. 8 ± 3. 7 (sire-daughter), 6. 9 ± 3. 3 (dam-son), 6. 8 ± 3. 1 (dam-daughter), and mean interval of 7. 3 ± 3. 4 years. The studied population showed moderate heritability coefficients, whereas the genetic gains based on the studied traits may be higher than those estimated by genetic tendencies. Reduced generation interval, increased effective size and continuous mating control of relatives are important strategies for the genetic progress of the Tabapuã breed in the region...|$|R

40|$|The anti-glycation {{activity}} of four kinds of beans including mung bean, black bean, soybean and cowpea were evaluated. Aqueous alcohol extract of mung bean exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity against {{the formation of}} fluorescent advanced glycation endproducts (<b>AGEs)</b> in a <b>bovine</b> serum albumin (BSA) -glucose model, and the inhibitory activities of extracts of the four beans {{were found to be}} highly correlated with their total phenolic contents (R 2 = 0. 95). Subsequent HPLC analysis of mung bean extract revealed two major phenolics which were purified and identified as vitexin and isovitexin by spectral methods. In the anti-glycation assays, both vitexin and isovitexin showed significant inhibitory activities against the formation of AGEs induced by glucose or methylglyoxal with efficacies of over 85 % at 100 μM. In another assay, vitexin and isovitexin failed to directly trap reactive carbonyl species, such as methylglyoxal, suggesting that their anti-glycation activities may mainly be due to their free radical scavenging capacity. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
