40|$|Mutual funds {{underwent}} some {{rapid development}} during 2008 - 2011, this was {{indicated by the}} escalation {{of a number of}} NAB and its inclusion units value. However, mutual funds still experience efficiency inconsistency on their operating activities. This research’s purpose is to analyse the efficiency level on each <b>mutual</b> funds <b>and</b> to compare efficiency between stock <b>mutual</b> funds <b>and</b> fixed-income <b>mutual</b> funds, stock <b>mutual</b> funds <b>and</b> mixed <b>mutual</b> funds, stock <b>mutual</b> funds <b>and</b> protected <b>mutual</b> funds, mixed <b>mutual</b> funds <b>and</b> protected <b>mutual</b> funds, fixed-income <b>mutual</b> funds <b>and</b> mixed <b>mutual</b> funds, <b>and</b> fixed-income <b>mutual</b> funds <b>and</b> protected <b>mutual</b> funds. There are eighty-nine mutual funds used as samples done by purposive sampling on this research; twenty-nine stock mutual funds, twenty-nine fixed-income mutual funds, twenty-one mixed <b>mutual</b> funds, <b>and</b> nine protected <b>mutual</b> funds. This research used Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method. A Unit Kegiatan Ekonomi (UKE) is considered efficient if the efficiency value reachs perfection (100 percent), on the contrary when the efficiency value is less than 100 percent, then the UKE is rated as inefficient. The variables on this research are chosen based on intermediation approach. The input variables are standard deviation of return, investation processing services cost ratio, custodian services cost ratio, other fees cost ratio, and redemption cost; and the output variables are average return and assets growth toward return. To find out the efficiency value difference on each mutual funds, the research used Mann Whitney U test. The result of analysis using DEA method indicated that fixed-income <b>mutual</b> funds <b>and</b> mixed <b>mutual</b> funds during 2008 - 2011 incline to have efficiency increase even though it’s fluctuating with the average of 84. 03 percent in fixed-income <b>mutual</b> funds <b>and</b> 81. 04 percent in mixed mutual funds. Mann Whitney U hypothesis testing shows that there is no efficiency difference between stock <b>mutual</b> funds <b>and</b> fixed-income <b>mutual</b> funds, mixed <b>mutual</b> funds <b>and</b> protected <b>mutual</b> funds, fixed-income <b>mutual</b> funds <b>and</b> protected <b>mutual</b> funds, <b>and</b> stock <b>mutual</b> funds <b>and</b> mixed <b>mutual</b> funds during 2008 - 2011; but there is an efficiency difference between stock <b>mutual</b> funds <b>and</b> protected <b>mutual</b> funds, <b>and</b> fixed-income <b>mutual</b> funds <b>and</b> mixed <b>mutual</b> funds during 2008 - 201...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} relationship between firm efficiency and choice of organizational form using a seven year panel data set of 586 life insurers. Our study window is from 1985 to 1991. We began the study with two questions in mind: "Do stocks <b>and</b> <b>mutuals</b> use different production technologies?" and "Are stocks <b>and</b> <b>mutuals</b> equally efficient or is one form relatively more efficient than the other?". Using some cost and error structure tests that resemble those found in recent efficiency studies, we find evidence that stocks <b>and</b> <b>mutuals</b> have distinctive cost structures and production technologies. Results also show that efficiency varies with organizational form, with stocks being more scale efficient than mutuals but mutuals being more X-efficient than stocks. ...|$|R

Courting males dive at the female, feeding her in mid-flight. The female grabs food from the male's talons with hers while flipping upside-down. They may lock talons and tumble downwards in a ritualised version of grappling, but release just before landing. All courtship displays are accompanied by constant calling.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} found several shortcomings in the airline's operating procedures, in particular lack of proper cockpit communication <b>and</b> <b>mutual</b> {{control of the}} descent and approach plans.

The investigating commission also found lack of proper pilot training in the airline. Flight 710 was the second of four Widerøe accidents between 1982 and 1993, all of which revealed shortcomings in the airline's operations and internal control.|$|E

Co-operatives are usually registered as co-operative societies under State-based legislation.

On 2 March 2015, the Senate referred an inquiry {{into the role of}} co-operatives <b>and</b> <b>mutuals</b> in the Australian economy to the Economics Reference Committee. The terms of reference include "barriers to innovation and growth" and the "impact of current regulations". This article examines the Co-operatives National Law (CNL) which has recently been introduced in some Australian States. The article will analyse the key aspects of the new law that will have the maximum impact on co-operative identity - control, governance and finance. The CNL will be compared with the Corporations Act 2001 to evaluate its effectiveness in articulating the co-operative's distinct identity and promoting co-operative growth...|$|R

40|$|Cahier n ° 2009 - 30 We {{show that}} an {{equilibrium}} always {{exists in the}} Rothschild-Stiglitz insurance market model with adverse selection when insurers can offer either non- participating or participating policies, i. e. insurance contracts which may involve policy dividends or supplementary calls for premium. The equilibrium coincides with the Miyazaki-Spence-Wilson equilibrium, which may involves cross-subsidization between contracts within subgroups of individuals. The paper establishes that participating policies act as an implicit threat that dissuades deviant insurers who aim at attracting low risk individuals only. The model predicts that the mutual corporate form should be prevalent in insurance markets or submarkets where second-best Pareto efficiency requires cross-subsidization between risk types. Stock insurers <b>and</b> <b>mutuals</b> may coexist, with stock insurers offering insurance coverage at actuarial price <b>and</b> <b>mutuals</b> cross-subsidizing risks. ...|$|R

The film makes a direct comparison between Picard's hatred of the Borg and refusal to destroy the Enterprise and that of Captain Ahab in Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick.
