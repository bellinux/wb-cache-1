5|$|At {{the end of}} the championship, {{the captains}} of the United States team (Tom Florie) <b>and</b> <b>Yugoslavia</b> (Milutin Ivković) both {{received}} bronze medals. Yet a FIFA technical committee report on the 1986 World Cup included full retrospective rankings of all teams at all previous World Cup finals; this report ranked the United States third <b>and</b> <b>Yugoslavia</b> fourth, a practice since continued by FIFA. In 2010, the son of Kosta Hadži, the chief of Yugoslav delegation at the 1930 World Cup and the vice-president of the Football Association of Yugoslavia at the time, claimed that Yugoslavia, as a team, has been awarded one bronze medal, which has been kept by Hadži himself and his family for the following 80 years. According to this source, Yugoslavia was placed third because of the semi-finals loss to the eventual champions, Uruguay.|$|E

The company was formed at the SS training centre in Dachau on 10 July 1942 from soldiers of the supply services training and replacement battalion of the 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama (2nd Croatian).|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{were the}} first team to beat the world champions, as goals from Denis Law, Bobby Lennox and Jim McCalliog secured a 3–2 victory at Wembley on 15 April 1967. Despite this set-back, England {{qualified}} for UEFA Euro 1968, which consisted of just four teams: England, Italy (hosts), the Soviet Union, <b>and</b> <b>Yugoslavia.</b> England played just two games at the tournament, losing 1–0 to Yugoslavia, and then beating the Soviets 2–0 in the third-place play-off.|$|E
5|$|The first {{evacuation}} of the 20th century occurred in 1915 when {{the horses were}} evacuated from Lipica due to World War I and placed at Laxenburg and Kladrub. Following the war, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was broken up, with Lipica becoming part of Italy. Thus, the animals were divided between several different studs in the new postwar nations of Austria, Italy, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania <b>and</b> <b>Yugoslavia.</b> The nation of Austria kept the stallions of the Spanish Riding School and some breeding stock. By 1920, the Austrian breeding stock was consolidated at Piber.|$|E

5|$|The {{national}} {{associations of}} selected nations {{were invited to}} send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the Atlantic Ocean for European sides. Indeed, no European country pledged to send a team until {{two months before the}} start of the competition. Rimet eventually persuaded teams from Belgium, France, Romania, <b>and</b> <b>Yugoslavia</b> to make the trip. In total, 13 nations took part: seven from South America, four from Europe and two from North America.|$|E
5|$|After Tommy Docherty's brief spell as manager, Willie Ormond {{was hired}} in 1973. Ormond lost his first match in charge 5–0 to England, but {{recovered}} to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974. At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany, Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament. The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference. After beating Zaïre, they drew with both Brazil <b>and</b> <b>Yugoslavia,</b> and went out because they had beaten Zaïre by the smallest margin.|$|E
5|$|During {{the breakup}} of Yugoslavia, the United States engaged in both combative and {{economic}} conflict, particularly with Serbia, known {{at the time as}} the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (one of socialist Yugoslavia's successor states). The United States imposed sanctions and spearheaded a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999. During this period, another wave of Serbian emigration ensued, and many Serbian refugees moved to the United States. In the 2000s, diplomatic relations between the United States <b>and</b> <b>Yugoslavia</b> were restored, but were changed when Montenegro seceded in 2006, after which Serbia was the successor state to continue relations previously held by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia in February 2008, a move which the US recognized.|$|E

5|$|Encouraged by {{the success}} he had {{achieved}} in Romania in 1940 {{with the help of}} his son-in-law, Berger had proposed to Himmler that the next recruiting sphere be the Volksdeutsche communities of Romania, Hungary <b>and</b> <b>Yugoslavia,</b> which together contained about 1.5 million ethnic Germans. Little could be done to further this proposal until mid-1941, by which time Yugoslavia had been overrun by the Axis, and Romania and Hungary had joined the pact. Immediately after the lightning-quick defeat of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Hausser was being pressed to accept Yugoslav Volksdeutsche into his renamed SS-Division-Reich, even before it was withdrawn to prepare for Operation Barbarossa. On his way back to Germany from Yugoslavia, Hausser had transited through Romania and gathered another 600 ethnic German volunteers who he smuggled out of the country.|$|E
5|$|FIFA {{president}} Jules Rimet intervened, {{and eventually}} four European teams {{made the trip}} by sea: Belgium, France, Romania, <b>and</b> <b>Yugoslavia.</b> The Romanians, managed by Constantin Rădulescu and coached by their captain Rudolf Wetzer and Octav Luchide, entered the competition following the intervention of newly crowned King CarolII. He selected the squad personally, and negotiated with employers {{to ensure that the}} players would still have jobs upon their return. The French entered at the personal intervention of Rimet, but neither France's star defender Manuel Anatol nor the team's regular coach Gaston Barreau could be persuaded to make the trip. The Belgians participated at the instigation of German-Belgian FIFA vice-president Rodolphe Seeldrayers.|$|E
5|$|Humanitarian {{workers and}} foreign {{military}} observers had suspicions that the Croats deliberately abandoned Jajce, {{as well as}} territories lost in Operation Corridor 92, to the VRS {{in exchange for the}} Prevlaka Peninsula south of Dubrovnik. Even though Croatia and several Western diplomats denied this claim, European Community envoy David Owen urged the UN to impose sanctions against Croatia. The suspicion was fueled by an October 1992 agreement between Croatian President Franjo Tuđman and Yugoslav President Dobrica Ćosić to withdraw the JNA from Prevlaka. However, the JNA withdrawal from Croatian soil had also {{been a part of the}} Vance plan, which was accepted by both Croatia <b>and</b> <b>Yugoslavia.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1960 Podgorny {{became a}} member of the Politburo (Political Bureau) and by 1963 had risen to {{prominence}} within the Soviet hierarchy as a member of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). As a protégé and close companion of Nikita Khrushchev, he travelled with him to United Nations headquarters in 1960. He acted as a Soviet emissary to Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Canada, <b>and</b> <b>Yugoslavia.</b> Podgorny's beliefs were strongly influenced by Khrushchev, and under Leonid Brezhnev's rule, Podgorny was one of the most liberal members within the Soviet leadership, even more liberal than Premier Alexei Kosygin.|$|E
5|$|In the Senate, Nixon took a {{prominent}} position in opposing global communism, traveling frequently and {{speaking out against}} it. He maintained friendly relations with his fellow anti-communist, the controversial Wisconsin senator, Joseph McCarthy, but was careful to keep some distance between himself and McCarthy's allegations. Nixon also criticized President Harry S. Truman's handling of the Korean War. He supported statehood for Alaska and Hawaii, {{voted in favor of}} civil rights for minorities, and supported federal disaster relief for India <b>and</b> <b>Yugoslavia.</b> He voted against price controls and other monetary restrictions, benefits for illegal immigrants, and public power.|$|E
5|$|In the {{elections}} of 1980, Indira Gandhi's party the Indian National Congress (I) returned to power by winning 351 seats in the Lok Sabha.

Indira {{was sworn in as}} Prime Minister by Reddy for what would become her last term in office in January 1980. Between 1980 and 1982 President Reddy led seven state visits abroad, visiting the USSR, Bulgaria, Kenya, Zambia, the UK, Ireland, Indonesia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Ireland <b>and</b> <b>Yugoslavia.</b> At home, as President, he signed an ordinance that gave the new government wide powers to imprison people for up to a year without trial under preventive detention and ordered the imposition of President's rule in nine opposition-ruled states on the advice of the government.|$|E
