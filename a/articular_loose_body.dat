40|$|Synovial chondromatosis is a {{cartilaginous}} metaplasia of the mesenchymal {{remnants of}} the synovial tissue of the joints. Its main characteristic is the formation of cartilaginous nodules in the synovium and inside the <b>articular</b> space (<b>loose</b> <b>bodies).</b> Synovial chondromatosis mainly affects big synovial joints such as the elbow and knee and is uncommon in the temporomandibular joint. The main symptoms are pain, limitation of jaw movement, crepitation, and inflammation. Diagnosis is made by panoramic radiograph, computed tomography scan, and mainly magnetic resonance imaging. Surgery is the therapeutic choice. The authors describe their experience in the treatment and in the follow up of a patient with unilateral synovial chondromatosis...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} case of a large peritoneal <b>loose</b> <b>body</b> {{diagnosed}} on computed tomography. The most common causes of a peritoneal <b>loose</b> <b>body</b> are thought to be torsion and separation of the appendices epiploicae. Peritoneal <b>loose</b> <b>bodies</b> are usually small, 0. 5 to 2. 5 cm in diameter. However, "giant" peritoneal <b>loose</b> <b>bodies,</b> larger than 4 cm in diameter, are an uncommon disease and present with various symptoms, and are difficult to diagnose preoperatively. Especially, abdominal large peritoneal <b>loose</b> <b>bodies</b> are frequently misdiagnosed as tumorous disease preoperatively. In our case, the <b>loose</b> <b>body</b> appeared as a round pelvic mass with central calcifications and a distinct fat plane separating it from adjacent organs. Preoperatively, we suspected a tumorous lesion from the wall of the upper rectum; however, at laparoscopy, a large peritoneal <b>loose</b> <b>body</b> was detected.

Presentation of case: A 58 -year-old man with two-year history of swelling and pain of the right shoulder. He had no history of tuberculosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Magnetic resonance (MR) images showed some bony <b>loose</b> <b>bodies</b> in the subacromial space. The removal of <b>loose</b> <b>bodies</b> and bursa debridement were performed arthroscopically.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONLoose bodies {{within the}} joint {{because of any}} cause have the {{potential}} for continued growth. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 41 -year-old man had suffered multiple recurrent dislocations of his left shoulder, accompanied with pain. His anterior apprehension and relocation tests were positive, but no other sign was noted on physical examination. On magnetic resonance imaging and at arthroscopy, two giant <b>loose</b> <b>bodies</b> were seen. They were in the axillary recess and were removed arthroscopically. DISCUSSIONMost authors recommend surgical removal of the cartilaginous <b>loose</b> <b>bodies</b> to ameliorate the symptoms. Furthermore, the majority of authors recommend a synovectomy to decrease the risk of recurrence. Depending {{on the size of the}} chondral <b>loose</b> <b>bodies,</b> removal can be performed via an arthrotomy, arthroscopy with mini-open arthrotomy, or arthroscopy.

40|$|<b>Loose</b> <b>bodies</b> are a rare {{cause of}} {{temporomandibular}} joint symptoms. Their main source is synovial chondromatosis.

Seven patients were evaluated and treated by means of arthroscopy, while in three patients open arthrotomy was performed. In five patients, no diagnostic imaging technique had demonstrated the presence of <b>loose</b> <b>bodies</b> prior to arthroscopy. In six patients, histology revealed synovial chondromatosis. In four patients, osteochondral fragments alone were found. Until now, the recommended treatment of choice {{for the removal of}} all <b>loose</b> <b>bodies</b> and of affected synovial tissue required open arthrotomy.

40|$|Introduction: A peritoneal <b>loose</b> <b>body</b> {{is a rare}} {{finding and}} is {{sometimes}} founded incidentally during laparotomy or autopsy. A giant peritoneal <b>loose</b> <b>body,</b> measuring more than 50  mm, is very rare, {{and only a few}} cases of laparoscopic extraction of these giant bodies {{have been reported in the}} literature. Presentation of case: A 70 -year-old man presented for evaluation of urinary frequency. He had no history of previous abdominal surgery or trauma. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed a giant oval-shaped mass with calcification of the luminal core, measuring 58  mm in diameter. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lesion with low intensity in T 1 -/T 2 -weighted images. Exploratory laparoscopy was performed. During the procedure, a yellow-white, oval-shaped mass with a “Boiled egg” appearance was discovered in front of the rectum. The mass was freely floating in the peritoneal cavity, without attachment to any intraperitoneal organs. The giant peritoneal <b>loose</b> <b>body</b> was extracted through a small incision, using an enlarged trocar site. Discussion: Most peritoneal <b>loose</b> <b>bodies</b> are small, not exceeding 2  cm in diameter, and are asymptomatic. Only a few cases of giant peritoneal <b>loose</b> <b>bodies</b> exceeding 5  cm have been reported. Conclusion: A giant peritoneal <b>loose</b> <b>body</b> is very rare and laparoscopic extraction was a useful technique.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Peritoneal <b>loose</b> <b>bodies,</b> or peritoneal mice, {{are rare}} {{asymptomatic}} lesions {{that are usually}} found as an incidental finding during abdominal surgery or autopsy. Giant <b>loose</b> <b>bodies,</b> measuring more than 5 cm, are rare {{and only a few}} cases are reported in the literature. These bodies are usually infarcted appendices epiploicae, which become detached and appear as a peritoneal <b>loose</b> <b>body</b> in the abdominal cavity. They may re-attach themselves to a surface, such as the lower aspect of the spleen or omentum, in which case they can be called a "parasitized peritoneal body", as in our case. Case Presentation We report a case of a giant <b>loose</b> peritoneal <b>body</b> measuring 7 × 5 cm found incidentally in a 64 -year-old Indian man who presented with acute intestinal obstruction. We present the current hypothesis and our opinion on the genesis of such large bodies and discuss the problems in diagnosis. Conclusion Peritoneal <b>loose</b> <b>bodies</b> are common but giant peritoneal <b>loose</b> <b>bodies</b> are very rare. These giant bodies usually do not require any treatment until they become complicated. Present diagnosis modalities have limitations in the diagnosis of mobile lesions in the abdominal cavity, so care must be taken to avoid unnecessary laparotomies in uncomplicated cases. </p...|$|R
30|$|Meniscal {{ossicles}} must {{be distinguished}} from <b>loose</b> <b>bodies,</b> as <b>loose</b> <b>bodies</b> require surgical removal while meniscal ossicles can be managed conservatively (as in our case), and arthroscopic removal can be retained as a last option. Van Breuseghem et al. [3] and Glass et al. [12] recommend surgical removal of the <b>loose</b> <b>body,</b> and further add that meniscal ossicles can be managed conservatively. The literature is silent about the appropriate type of conservative management. Arthroscopy is a definitive modality, and arthroscopic removal of ossicles is usually the last resort [4]. MRI can definitely distinguish between the two, and diagnostic arthroscopy can be avoided.|$|R

30|$|Synovial {{osteochondromatosis}} is an idiopathic benign chondral and/or osseous metaplasia of the synovia. Its exact aetiology {{remains unknown}} and it presents <b>loose</b> <b>bodies</b> in the synovial cavity [31] (Fig.  18). Although standard radiographs can show radiopaque calcifications and intra-articular <b>loose</b> <b>bodies,</b> MRI is the imaging technique {{of choice in}} the accurate assessment of synovial osteochondromatosis.|$|R
30|$|Radiologically, the commonest {{misdiagnosis}} is a <b>loose</b> <b>body.</b> A lateral X-ray knee shows {{a triangular}} radiodense opacity projected over the posterior joint line. On fluoroscopy, the ossicle moves with the tibia during knee rotation [7]. USG can distinguish between <b>loose</b> <b>bodies</b> and ossicles, {{but it is}} operator dependent. This differentiation can also be made with arthrography and CT arthrography, but these are invasive procedures [10].|$|R

40|$|Background: Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) can {{progress}} to <b>loose</b> <b>body</b> formation, {{with or without}} subchondral bone attachment to the lesion. The efficacy of internal fixation of chondral <b>loose</b> <b>bodies</b> has not been determined. Hypothesis: Operative fixation of cartilaginous <b>loose</b> <b>bodies</b> would result in (1) healed OCD at second-look arthroscopy, (2) restored cartilage appearance on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and (3) nearly normal knee function, as determined by patient-reported outcome scores. Study Design: Retrospective case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Five patients who underwent cartilaginous <b>loose</b> <b>body</b> fixation were identified. Lesions were located on the lateral trochlea (n 2) and medial femoral condyle (n 3) (mean size, 2. 5 cm 2). <b>Loose</b> <b>bodies</b> were reattached with compression screws through mini-arthrotomy or arthroscopy. Patients were nonweightbearing for 12 weeks postoperatively. After 12 weeks, screws were removed arthroscopically, and OCD stability was evaluated. Three patients underwent MRI to determine articular cartilage status. Images were evaluated using the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score. Patients were interviewed and completed the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire. Results: Four patients had stable lesions at 12 weeks after surgery. One patient had slight motion to one-third of the lesion and stability to the remaining two-thirds. Three patients underwent an MRI. The mean time from surgery to MRI was 3. 1 years.
