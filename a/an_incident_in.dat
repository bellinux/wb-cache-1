5|$|Bremner's last cap came against Denmark on 3 September 1975. <b>An</b> <b>incident</b> <b>in</b> Copenhagen {{after the}} game where several players were ejected from a nightclub for an alleged fight led to a {{lifetime}} ban from international football by the Scottish Football Association; four other players, Willie Young, Joe Harper, Pat McCluskey and Arthur Graham also were banned for life (Graham and Harper later had their bans overturned). Bremner maintained his innocence, stating that the incident had been {{blown out of proportion}} by the SFA.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} his {{athletic}} record and remarkable career accomplishments, Ford acquired {{a reputation as a}} clumsy, likable, and simple-minded Everyman. <b>An</b> <b>incident</b> <b>in</b> 1975, when he tripped while exiting Air Force One in Austria, was famously and repeatedly parodied by Chevy Chase, cementing Ford's image as a klutz. Pieces of Ford's common Everyman image have also been attributed to Ford's inevitable comparison to Nixon, as well as his perceived Midwestern stodginess and self-deprecation.|$|E

As she had committed similar offences in 2001 and 2008, her resulting probation was seen by some commentators as too lenient.|$|E

It is also unlikely that the group of Ho-Chunk had the sanction of their nation. Killed in the massacre were United States Indian Agent Felix St. Vrain and three of his companions. Some accounts reported that St. Vrain's body was mutilated.|$|E

5|$|With Goya we do {{not think}} of the studio or even of the artist at work. We think only of the event.

I am ashamed to say that I once thought so; but the longer I look at this extraordinary picture and at Goya's other works, the more clearly I recognise that I was mistaken.|$|E

It was found to be generally superior to dicoumarol, and in 1954 was approved for medical use in humans.

Sukumar worked on 1:Nenokkadine script for two months, and considered it his dream project.|$|E
5|$|Although Apollonius {{wrote his}} poem in the 3rd century BC, the {{composition}} of the story of the Argonauts is earlier than Odyssey, which shows familiarity with the exploits of Jason (the wandering of Odysseus may have been partly founded on it). In ancient times the expedition was regarded as a historical fact, <b>an</b> <b>incident</b> <b>in</b> the opening up of the Black Sea to Greek commerce and colonization. It was also extremely popular, forming a cycle to which a number of local legends became attached. The story of Medea, in particular, caught the imagination of the tragic poets.|$|E

It was rumoured that the bridge supports were not fully connected at the time. There were witnessed fatalities involving drownings and crushing by the bridge structures. Public discussion of the disaster was restricted and the number of casualties remains unknown. The pontoon bridge was never re-erected at the site; the Mindaugas Bridge now serves this need.|$|E
