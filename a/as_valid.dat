5|$|Following Carl Linnaeus's first {{descriptions}} of the species, several lion specimen were described and proposed as subspecies, of which 11 were recognised <b>as</b> <b>valid</b> in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many species}} have been named, modern paleontologists {{recognize}} only one, T. bataar, <b>as</b> <b>valid.</b> Some experts see this species as an Asian representative of the North American genus Tyrannosaurus; this would make the genus Tarbosaurus redundant. Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, if not synonymous, {{are considered to be}} at least closely related genera. Alioramus, also from Mongolia, is thought by some authorities to be the closest relative of Tarbosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Colbert is a {{producer}} of The 1 Second Film, the world's largest nonprofit collaborative art film. His video request that IMDb list his credit for The 1 Second Film ("it is <b>as</b> <b>valid</b> as most of my credits") enabled thousands of the film's producers to be listed in the massive movie database until they were removed in early 2007.|$|E

5|$|Intermediate birds occur {{where the}} {{recognised}} forms meet and interbreed, and have sometimes been given subspecies status, including S. b. kreczmeri in Poland and S. b. pateffi in Bulgaria, {{but these are}} not generally accepted <b>as</b> <b>valid</b> taxa.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scientists}} regard {{other species}} <b>as</b> <b>valid</b> as well, for example P.erlenbergensis. Such works, however, ignore Moser (2003), the publication {{that shows the}} type series of P.engelhardti to be diagnostic, and other material to be referable to it.|$|E

5|$|The Old Court – New Court {{controversy}} was a 19th-century political {{controversy in}} the U.S. state of Kentucky in which the Kentucky General Assembly abolished the Kentucky Court of Appeals {{and replaced it with}} a new court. The justices of the old court refused to recognize the action <b>as</b> <b>valid,</b> and for a time, two separate courts operated as the court of last resort for the state.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{potential}} species assigned to the carnosaurian dinosaur genus Allosaurus since its description in 1877 by Othniel Charles Marsh, but only a handful are still regarded <b>as</b> <b>valid.</b> Allosaurus was originally described from material from the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of the western United States of America; the type species A. fragilis became one of the best-known species of dinosaur.|$|E
5|$|Basiliscus re-instated Timothy Aelurus and Peter the Fuller {{to their}} sees, and by persuasion {{of the former}} issued (9 April 475) a {{circular}} letter (Enkyklikon) to the bishops calling them to accept <b>as</b> <b>valid</b> only the first three ecumenical synods, and reject the Council of Chalcedon. All bishops were to sign the edict. While most of the Eastern bishops accepted the letter, Patriarch Acacius of Constantinople refused, {{with the support of}} the population of the city, clearly showing his disdain towards Basiliscus by draping the icons in Hagia Sophia in black.|$|E
50|$|Valdés & Gosliner (2001) synonymized the genera Aporodoris Ihering, 1886 and Taringa Er. Marcus, 1955. They used Taringa <b>as</b> the <b>valid</b> name (declaring {{it to be}} a nomen protectum) {{because they}} (erroneously) {{considered}} the senior synonym Aporodoris not to have been used <b>as</b> a <b>valid</b> name since 1886.|$|R

5|$|Because Iguanodon {{is one of}} {{the first}} dinosaur genera to have been named, {{numerous}} species have been assigned to it. While never becoming the wastebasket taxon several other early genera of dinosaurs (such as Megalosaurus) became, Iguanodon has had a complicated history, and its taxonomy continues to undergo revisions. Although Gregory Paul recommended restricting I. bernissartensis to the famous sample from Bernissart, ornithopod workers like Norman and McDonald have disagreed with Paul's recommendations, except exercising caution when accepting records of Iguanodon from France and Spain <b>as</b> <b>valid.</b>|$|E
5|$|David E. Starkey and {{collaborators}} advanced a {{new view}} of the subspecies in 2003. Based on {{a study of the}} mitochondrial DNA, they rejected the glacial development theory and argued that the southern painted turtle should be elevated to a separate species, C. dorsalis, while the other subspecies should be collapsed into one and not differentiated. However, this proposition was largely unrecognized because successful breeding between all subspecies was documented wherever they overlapped. Nevertheless, in 2010, the IUCN recognized both C. dorsalis and C.p.dorsalis <b>as</b> <b>valid</b> names for the southern painted turtle.|$|E
5|$|In May 2010, a new {{taxonomy}} of the Bivalvia {{was published in}} the journal Malacologia. In compiling this, the authors used a variety of phylogenetic information including molecular analysis, anatomical analysis, shell morphology and shell microstructure as well as bio-geographic, paleobiogeographic and stratigraphic information. In this classification 324 families are recognized <b>as</b> <b>valid,</b> 214 of which are known exclusively from fossils and 110 of which occur in the recent past, with or without a fossil record. This classification has since been adopted by WoRMS.|$|E

5|$|Several {{branches}} of creationism, including creation science, neo-creationism, and intelligent design, {{argue that the}} idea of life being directly designed by a god or intelligence is at least as scientific as evolutionary theory, and should therefore be taught in public education. Such arguments against evolution have become widespread and include objections to evolution's evidence, methodology, plausibility, morality, and scientific acceptance. The scientific community does not recognize such objections <b>as</b> <b>valid,</b> pointing to detractors' misinterpretations of such things as the scientific method, evidence, and basic physical laws.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{from the}} time of the March 1605 {{conclave}} listed up to twenty-one possible candidates considered by the cardinals, but the only ones that were seriously discussed during the conclave were Cesare Baronius and Alessandro Ottaviano de' Medici. That conclave saw Spain veto Cesare Baronius after the first ballot. Medici, the candidate who was finally elected, was also vetoed by the cardinal representing Spain but this occurred after the election of Leo XI, and the cardinals did not view the veto <b>as</b> <b>valid.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{existing}} {{court and}} the anti-relief party refused to recognize the new court <b>as</b> <b>valid.</b> Achilles Sneed, clerk of the Old Court, refused a legislative mandate to turn over his records to the New Court by January 1825. Francis Blair, the New Court clerk, assembled a group that broke into Sneed's office and took what records they could find. Sneed was charged with contempt of court and fined for refusing {{to turn over the}} records. The Old Court continued to meet in a church in Frankfort; with two supreme courts, the possibility of civil war in Kentucky loomed.|$|E

5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the common thresher, as Squalus vulpinus, was written by French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in the 1788 Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique des trois règnes de la nature. In 1810, Constantine Samuel Rafinesque described Alopias macrourus from a thresher shark caught off Sicily. Later authors recognized the genus Alopias <b>as</b> <b>valid</b> while synonymizing A. macrourus with S. vulpinus, and thus the common thresher's scientific name became Alopias vulpinus.|$|E
5|$|As {{viewed by}} the Catholic Church, Baptism {{is the first of}} three sacraments of {{initiation}} as a Christian. It washes away all sins, both original sin and personal actual sins. It makes a person a member of the Church. As a gratuitous gift of God that requires no merit {{on the part of the}} person who is baptised, it is conferred even on children, who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account of original sin. If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone—be it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent—may baptise the child. Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated. The Catholic Church recognises <b>as</b> <b>valid</b> baptisms conferred even by people who are not Catholics or Christians, provided that they intend to baptise ("to do what the Church does when she baptises") and that they use the Trinitarian baptismal formula.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Texas filed a {{trespass}} to try title suit {{to reclaim}} the lake bed for the state. In Welder v. State, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Austin declared the lake permanent and navigable-in-fact, granting the bed to the state under {{the purview of the}} Texas Game, Fish and Oyster Commission (later Texas Parks and Wildlife Department). Without permission from the Texas Attorney General, the Texas Land Commissioner then sold the bed to a private buyer for agricultural use in 1918. In the 1948 case of State v. Bryan, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Austin upheld the sale <b>as</b> <b>valid</b> under color of law, and immune from a trespass to try title suit due to the one-year statute of limitations on land sales. However, under the Texas Water Rights Adjudication Act of 1967, Green Lake was classified as a public body of water. The Supreme Court of Texas affirmed this classification in 1988, rejecting the argument of the bed's then-owner {{that it was not a}} lake by definition, but a natural depression flooded with surface runoff.|$|E
