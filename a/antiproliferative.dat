5|$|In 2006, {{researchers}} of Oman's Sultan Qaboos University published {{their findings}} from a chemical {{investigation into the}} leaves in which they found it contained semiglabrin, semigalbrinol, and a new flavanone named apollineanin. One 2014 study revealed that pseudosemiglabrin extracted from the aerial parts of Tephrosia apollinea had an <b>antiproliferative</b> effect on cancer cell lines.|$|E
25|$|The <b>antiproliferative</b> {{effects of}} {{sirolimus}} {{may have a}} role in treating cancer. When dosed appropriately, sirolimus can enhance the immune response to tumor targeting or otherwise promote tumor regression in clinical trials. Sirolimus seems to lower the cancer risk in some transplant patients.|$|E
25|$|In kidney cells, the {{bradykinin}} receptor B2 {{has been}} shown to interact directly with a protein tyrosine phosphatase. The presence of a tyrosine-phosphorylated ITIM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif) sequence in the B2 receptor is necessary to mediate this interaction and subsequently the <b>antiproliferative</b> effect of bradykinin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Antiproliferative</b> {{actions on}} bone marrow and GI tissue: Due to the drug's {{preference}} for rapidly proliferating tissues, bone marrow depression (anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, or even rarely agranulocytosis) may occur. Aplastic anemia {{has also been}} seen. Bone marrow toxicity can be irreversible and may cause death, particularly in immunocompromised patients. GI toxicity may be severe or rarely fatal and consists of anorexia, abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, duodenal ulcer, GI hemorrhage, nausea, vomiting, and ulcerative colitis.|$|E
25|$|It is {{produced}} by the bacterium Streptomyces hygroscopicus and was isolated {{for the first time}} in 1972 by Surendra Nath Sehgal and colleagues from samples of Streptomyces hygroscopicus found on Easter Island. The compound was originally named rapamycin after the native name of the island, Rapa Nui. Sirolimus was initially developed as an antifungal agent. However, this use was abandoned when it was discovered to have potent immunosuppressive and <b>antiproliferative</b> properties due to its ability to inhibit mTOR. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in September 1999 and is marketed under the trade name Rapamune by Pfizer (formerly by Wyeth).|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{a wide variety of}} drugs that can trigger dysgeusia, {{including}} zopiclone, H1-antihistamines, such as azelastine and emedastine. Approximately 250 drugs affect taste. The sodium channels linked to taste receptors can be inhibited by amiloride, and the creation of new taste buds and saliva can be impeded by <b>antiproliferative</b> drugs. Saliva can have traces of the drug, giving rise to a metallic flavor in the mouth; examples include lithium carbonate and tetracyclines. Drugs containing sulfhydryl groups, including penicillamine and captopril, may react with zinc and cause deficiency. Metronidazole and chlorhexidine have been found to interact with metal ions that associate with the cell membrane. Drugs that prevent the production of angiotensin II by inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme, eprosartan for example, have been linked to dysgeusia. There are few case reports claiming calcium channel blockers like Amlodipine also cause dysguesia by blocking calcium sensitive taste buds.|$|E
25|$|IGFBP-3 exerts <b>antiproliferative</b> {{effects in}} many cell types by {{blocking}} {{the ability of}} IGF-1 and IGF-2 to activate the IGF1R (which stimulates cell proliferation). For example, in esophageal epithelial cells, responsiveness to IGF-1 stimulation is suppressed by secreted IGFBP-3 and restored when IGFBP-3 is downregulated by epidermal growth factor. IGFBP-3 can also inhibit cell function by mechanisms that are independent of effects on IGF1R signaling, even in cells that entirely lack IGF1R. IGF (or IGF1R) independent effects are commonly studied using mutant forms of IGFBP-3 with decreased IGF binding affinity. Thus, IGFBP-3-induced apoptosis in differentiating chondrocyte precursor cells is seen equally with a non-IGF binding IGFBP-3 mutant, demonstrating that the mechanism does not involve IGF binding. IGF1R-independent growth inhibition by IGFBP-3 may involve the induction of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bad and may be mediated by ceramides (pro-apoptotic lipids), or potentiate ceramide action IGFBP-3 interaction with nuclear hormone receptors may also lead to inhibition of cell proliferation.|$|E
2500|$|Ellagic acid has <b>antiproliferative</b> and {{antioxidant}} {{properties in}} a number of in vitro and small-animal models. The <b>antiproliferative</b> properties of ellagic acid may be due to its ability to directly inhibit the DNA binding of certain carcinogens, including nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. [...] As with other polyphenol antioxidants, ellagic acid has a chemoprotective effect in cellular models by reducing oxidative stress.|$|E

2500|$|The drug {{is mainly}} to inhibit neointimal growth (due to {{proliferation}} of smooth muscle cells) which would cause restenosis. [...] Much of the neointimal hyperplasia {{seems to be}} caused by inflammation. Hence, immunosuppressive and <b>antiproliferative</b> drugs are used. Sirolimus, paclitaxel, and everolimus were previously used for other medical applications and have been included in licensed DES.|$|E
2500|$|NO exerts <b>antiproliferative</b> effects by cGMP-dependent {{inhibiting}} Ca2+ influx or by directly inhibiting {{the activity}} of arginase and ornithine decarboxylase, decreasing the generation of polyamides required for DNA synthesis. NO also has antithrombotic effects that result of its diffusion across platelet membrane and sGC activation, resulting in inhibition of platelet aggregation. Moreover, NO affects leukocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium by inhibiting the [...] nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), which induces vascular endothelial expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules.|$|E
2500|$|Paclitaxel {{is used as}} an <b>antiproliferative</b> {{agent for}} the {{prevention}} of restenosis (recurrent narrowing) of coronary and peripheral stents; locally delivered to the wall of the artery, a paclitaxel coating limits the growth of neointima (scar tissue) within stents. [...] Paclitaxel drug eluting coated stents for coronary artery placement are sold under the trade name Taxus by Boston Scientific in the United States. Paclitaxel drug eluting coated stents for femoropopliteal artery placement are sold under the trade name Zilver PTX by Cook Medical, Inc.|$|E
2500|$|Calcification forms among {{vascular}} {{smooth muscle}} {{cells of the}} surrounding muscular layer, specifically in the muscle cells adjacent to atheromas and {{on the surface of}} atheroma plaques and tissue. In time, as cells die, this leads to extracellular calcium deposits between the muscular wall and outer portion of the atheromatous plaques. With the atheromatous plaque interfering with the regulation of the calcium deposition, it accumulates and crystallizes. [...] A similar form of an intramural calcification, presenting the picture of an early phase of arteriosclerosis, appears to be induced by a number of drugs that have an <b>antiproliferative</b> mechanism of action (Rainer Liedtke 2008).|$|E
2500|$|The <b>antiproliferative</b> {{effect of}} {{sirolimus}} {{has also been}} {{used in conjunction with}} coronary stents to prevent restenosis in coronary arteries following balloon angioplasty. [...] The sirolimus is formulated in a polymer coating that affords controlled release through the healing period following coronary intervention. [...] Several large clinical studies have demonstrated lower restenosis rates in patients treated with sirolimus-eluting stents when compared to bare-metal stents, resulting in fewer repeat procedures. A sirolimus-eluting coronary stent was marketed by Cordis, a division of Johnson & Johnson, under the tradename Cypher. [...] However, this kind of stent may also increase the risk of vascular thrombosis.|$|E
2500|$|... (+)-Discodermolide is {{a highly}} potent <b>antiproliferative</b> agent. (+)-Discodermolide treated murine Do11.10T {{hybridoma}} cells could not proceed normal cell cycling. [...] In untreated controls, 68% of cells were found at G1 phase, and 31% were found at S phase, and less than 1% was found at the G2/M phase. However, after 3 hours [...] (+)-discodermolide treatment, 52% were found at [...] G1 phase, 40% at S phase, and 58% at G2 and M phase. This result indicated that (+)-discodermolide blocks the cell cycle at G2 and M phase. This inhibition effect was [...] also found to be reversible. Cells resume normal cycling within 48 hours after removal of (+)-discodermolide from the cell culture medium.|$|E
2500|$|The main IGFBP-3 ligands in the {{circulation}} are IGF-1 and IGF-2, and the acid-labile subunit (ALS). The serum proteins transferrin, fibronectin, and plasminogen are also known to bind IGFBP-3. [...] In the cell and tissue environment many other interactions {{have been described}} (see Table). Two unrelated cell-surface proteins have been designated as IGFBP-3 receptors: low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), also known as alpha-2-macroglobulin receptor or type V TGFβ receptor and the transmembrane protein TMEM219. Both are believed to mediate <b>antiproliferative</b> effects. Functional interactions with the EGF receptor and the type I/type II TGFβ receptor system have also been reported, and other cell-surface proteins such as proteoglycans also bind IGFBP-3. IGFBP-3 can enter cells by both clathrin-mediated and caveolin-mediated endocytosis. possibly involving the transferrin receptor.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the JAK-STAT pathway, IFNs can activate several other signaling cascades. [...] For instance, both type I and type II IFNs activate {{a member of the}} CRK family of adaptor proteins called CRKL, a nuclear adaptor for STAT5 that also regulates signaling through the C3G/Rap1 pathway. [...] Type I IFNs further activate p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) to induce gene transcription. [...] Antiviral and <b>antiproliferative</b> effects specific to type I IFNs result from p38 MAP kinase signaling. [...] The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is also regulated by both type I and type II IFNs. [...] PI3K activates P70-S6 Kinase 1, an enzyme that increases protein synthesis and cell proliferation; phosphorylates of ribosomal protein s6, which is involved in protein synthesis; and phosphorylates a translational repressor protein called eukaryotic translation-initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (EIF4EBP1) in order to deactivate it.|$|E
2500|$|A stent is {{a foreign}} {{object in the}} body, and the body {{responds}} to the stent’s presence {{in a variety of}} ways. [...] Macrophages accumulate around the stent, and nearby smooth muscle cells proliferate. [...] These physiological changes, which can cause restenosis, are limited by the drugs released by the stent, but these drugs also limit formation of a new endothelial layer over the new stent to inhibit clot formation. Endothelialization is a hallmark of vascular healing and is important for the prevention of thrombus formation. Lack of healing caused by <b>antiproliferative</b> drugs can make the stent an exposed surface on which a clot, sometimes life-threatening, can form. For drug-eluting stents (which, by design, delay formation of a new endothelium cover over the stent), the incidence of clot formation within the stent may persist {{for a longer period of}} time, perhaps as long as five years after treatment. Drug-eluting stents have been associated with delayed arterial healing and the prevalence of latent thrombus after five years, suggesting patients may continue to be at risk for stent thrombosis for an extended period of time.|$|E
2500|$|... (+)-Discodermolide is a polyketide {{natural product}} found to {{stabilize}} microtubule. (+)-discodermolide was isolated by Gunasekera {{and his co-workers}} at the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute from the deep-sea sponge Discodermia dissoluta in 1990. (+)-Discodermolide {{was found to be}} a potent inhibitor of tumor cell growth in several MDR cancer cell lines. [...] (+)-discodermolide also shows some unique characters, including a linear backbone structure, immunosuppressive properties both in vitro and in vivo, potent induction of an accelerated senescence phenotype, and synergistic <b>antiproliferative</b> activity in combination with paclitaxel. Discodermolide was {{recognized as one of the}} most potent natural promoters of tubulin assembly. A large number of efforts toward the total synthesis of (+)-discodermolide were directed by its interesting biological activities and extreme scarcity of natural sources (0.002% w/w from frozen marine sponge). The compound supply necessary for complete clinical trials cannot be met by harvesting, isolation, and purification. As of 2005, attempts at synthesis or semi-synthesis by fermentation have proven unsuccessful. As a result, all discodermolide used in preclinical studies and clinical trials has come from large-scale total synthesis.|$|E
2500|$|An {{increased}} risk of HPV+OPC is observed more than 15 years after HPV exposure, pointing to a slow development of the disease, similar to that seen in cervical cancer. Relative to HPV-OPC, the oncogenic molecular progression of HPV+OPC is poorly understood. [...] The two main viral oncoproteins of the high risk HPV types are E6 and E7. These are consistently expressed in malignant cell lines, and if their expression is inhibited the malignant phenotype of the cancer cells is blocked. Either of these oncoproteins can immortalise cell lines, but are more efficient when both are expressed, since their separate molecular roles are synergistic. The E6 and E7 oncogenes become integrated into host-cell DNA, and the oncoproteins they express interfere {{with a variety of}} predominantly <b>antiproliferative</b> cellular regulatory mechanisms. They bind to and inactivate the best known of these mechanisms, the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and retinoblastoma protein pRB (pRb) leading to genomic instability and then cell cycle deregulation (see Chung et al., 2016 Fig. 35.2). Further, yet to be elicited, mechanisms are required for the final steps of malignant transformation of HPV infected cells.|$|E

50|$|Aplog-1, {{a simple}} and less {{hydrophobic}} analogue of aplysiatoxin, is a new PKC ligand with little tumor-promoting activity that showed growth-inhibitory activities against several cancer cell lines. Multiple derivatives were evaluated for their <b>antiproliferative</b> activity against several human cancer cell lines and binding activity for PKCδ, which plays a tumor suppressor role and is involved in apoptosis. The {{results showed that the}} dimethyl groups at position 6 are indispensable to these activities, but that the hydroxyl group at position 18 is not necessary. Of note, the more hydrophobic 12,12-dimethyl-aplog-1 (3) did not show any tumor-promoting activity in vitro or in vivo. These results suggest that hydrophobicity around the spiroketal moiety of aplog-1 would enhance <b>antiproliferative</b> activities but not tumor-promoting activity. The <b>antiproliferative</b> activities of the analogs to not simply depend on molecular hydrophobicity, and the local hydrophobicity around position 10 {{plays an important role in}} enhancing <b>antiproliferative</b> activities.
