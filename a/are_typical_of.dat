5|$|Cholesterol {{levels may}} be {{determined}} {{as part of}} health screening for health insurance or occupational health, when the external physical signs such as xanthelasma, xanthoma, arcus are noticed, symptoms of cardiovascular disease develop, or a family member {{has been found to}} have FH. A pattern compatible with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa on the Fredrickson classification is typically found: raised level of total cholesterol, markedly raised level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), normal level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and normal level of triglycerides. Total cholesterol levels of 350–550 mg/dL <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> heterozygous FH while total cholesterol levels of 650–1000 mg/dL <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> homozygous FH. The LDL is typically above the 75th percentile, that is, 75% of the healthy population would have a lower LDL level. Cholesterol levels can be drastically higher in people with FH who are also obese.|$|E

5|$|Other jet streams also exist. During the Northern Hemisphere summer, easterly jets {{can form}} in {{tropical}} regions, typically where dry air encounters more humid air at high altitudes. Low-level jets also <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> various regions {{such as the}} central United States.|$|E

5|$|Raelians deride {{the current}} state-system as {{inadequate}} {{for dealing with}} contemporary global issues that <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> Globalisation, such as Environmentalism, Social Justice, Human Rights, and the current economic system. In line with this, Geniocracy proposes a different economic model called Humanitarianism.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{plans or}} {{strategic}} themes will often arise from particular groups of openings which {{result in a}} specific type of pawn structure. An example is the , which is the attack of queenside pawns against an opponent who has more pawns on the queenside. The study of openings is therefore connected to the preparation of plans that <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> the resulting middlegames.|$|E
5|$|The bat has a {{distinctive}} swollen, pig-like snout with thin, vertical nostrils. Its ears are relatively large, while its eyes {{are small and}} mostly concealed by fur. Its teeth <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> an insectivorous bat. The dental formula is 1:1:1:3 in the upper jaw and 2:1:2:3 in the lower jaw, with large upper incisors.|$|E
50|$|Seseo <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> the American, Canarian dialects , Philippine {{and some}} dialects of central Andalusia, whereas distinción <b>is</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> most dialects in Spain, except {{in much of}} Andalusia and the Canary Islands.

There were no hesitation wounds, which <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> suicide by self-infliction. However, the authorities do not seem to be investigating the case further.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{great deal}} of variety among Labradors. The {{following}} characteristics <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> the conformation show bred (bench-bred) lines of this breed in the United States and are based on the American Kennel Club standard. Significant differences between UK and US standards are noted.|$|E
5|$|As a {{pervasive}} developmental disorder, Asperger syndrome is distinguished by {{a pattern of}} symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language. Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted prosody, and physical clumsiness <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> the condition, but are not required for diagnosis. Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.|$|E

5|$|Assuming a {{composition}} {{similar to that}} of Jupiter and that the planet's atmosphere is close to chemical equilibrium, it is predicted that 55 Cancri d is covered in a layer of water clouds: the planet's internal heat probably keeps it too warm to form the ammonia-based clouds that <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter. Its surface gravity is likely to be about 4 to 5 times stronger than Jupiter, or about 10 to 15 times that of Earth which is because the radius of the planet is unlikely to be much more than Jupiter's and is probably slightly smaller than Jupiter due to the high metal content in the parent star.|$|E
5|$|Durian {{flowers are}} large and {{feathery}} with copious nectar, and give off a heavy, sour, and buttery odour. These features <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> flowers pollinated by certain species of bats that eat nectar and pollen. According to research conducted in Malaysia in the 1970s, durians were pollinated almost exclusively by cave fruit bats (Eonycteris spelaea); however, a 1996 study indicated two species, D. grandiflorus and D. oblongus, were pollinated by spiderhunters (Nectariniidae) and another species, D. kutejensis, was pollinated by giant honey bees and birds as well as bats.|$|E
5|$|H. erectus {{arrived in}} Eurasia {{approximately}} 1.8 million years ago, in an event {{considered to be}} the first African exodus. There is evidence that the Java population of H. erectus lived in an ever-wet forest habitat. More specifically the environment resembled a savannah, but was likely regularly inundated ("hydromorphic savanna"). The plants found at the Trinil excavation site included grass (Poaceae), ferns, Ficus, and Indigofera, which <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> lowland rainforest.|$|E

5|$|Leicestershire and Rutland are {{landlocked}} lowland {{counties and}} most of the birds <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> English farmland habitat. Many coastal, oceanic and highland birds are absent or rare, and there are few rare vagrants compared to coastal areas. The construction of two large reservoirs, Eyebrook Reservoir in 1940 and Rutland Water (England's largest reservoir) in 1976, has provided freshwater environments enabling many aquatic birds to thrive.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{evidence}} indicates that even non-avian dinosaurs and birds thrived in cooler temperate climates, and {{that at least some}} early species must have regulated their body temperature by internal biological means (aided by the animals' bulk in large species and feathers or other body coverings in smaller species). Evidence of endothermy in Mesozoic dinosaurs includes the discovery of polar dinosaurs in Australia and Antarctica as well as analysis of blood-vessel structures within fossil bones that <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> endotherms. Scientific debate continues regarding the specific ways in which dinosaur temperature regulation evolved.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} its western border {{running along the}} Finland–Norway border. The two most {{prominent}} lakes are Ellenvatn and Ødevatn, both of which flow into tributaries of the river Pasvikelva. The fauna and flora <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> the Siberian taiga, and include some species uncommon for Norway. The park is a habitat for the brown bear and also has a large population of moose; reindeer husbandry takes place during winter. Eight species of fish live in the lakes and the park has 190 species of flowering plants.|$|E

5|$|The {{preserved}} {{contents of}} its digestive tract <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> {{those of other}} predators', and this lifestyle {{is supported by the}} raptor-like nature of the spiny great appendages {{and the size of the}} eyes. The organism was clearly a competent swimmer, propelling itself with the 'flippers' attached to its head, and using its wing-like lobes on the 11th segment to steer. These lobes presumably derived from the lateral lobes of Cambrian anomalocaridids, ancestors that used lobes along their sides to swim, and lacked the specializations of Schinderhannes.|$|E
5|$|The {{unblemished}} musculature of {{the central}} figure waving to the rescue ship {{is reminiscent of the}} Neoclassical, however the naturalism of light and shadow, the authenticity of the desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures. Both the choice of subject matter and the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> Romantic painting—strong indications {{of the extent to which}} Géricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include observations of specific abnormal movements, {{as well as}} more general observations of the patient's level of activity and arousal, and observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. Abnormal movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may indicate a neurological disorder. A tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which <b>are</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E
