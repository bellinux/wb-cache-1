25|$|I was dining that Saturday evening chez Bradman, {{and with}} Jessie Bradman {{and her son}} John was {{escaping}} the rush by leaving an over before the close.

25|$|Focusing on the exaggerated indemnity, Twain said:To Dr. Smith the “thirteen-fold-extra” clearly {{stood for}} “theft and extortion,” <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> {{distinctly}} right, indisputably right. He manifestly thinks {{that when it}} got scaled away down to a mere “one-third” a little thing like that was some other than “theft and extortion.” Why, only the board knows! I will try to explain this difficult problem so that the board can {{get an idea of}} it. If a pauper owes me a dollar and I catch him unprotected and make him pay me fourteen dollars thirteen of it is “theft and extortion.” If I make him pay only one dollar thirty-three and a third cents the thirty-three and a third cents are “theft and extortion,” just the same.|$|E
25|$|The obituaries {{shortly after}} Lawrence's death were, with the {{exception}} of the one by E. M. Forster, unsympathetic or hostile. However, there were those who articulated a more favourable recognition of the significance of this author's life and works. For example, his long-time friend Catherine Carswell summed up his life in a letter to the periodical Time and Tide published on 16 March 1930. In response to his critics, she claimed:"In the face of formidable initial disadvantages and lifelong delicacy, poverty that lasted for three quarters of his life and hostility that survives his death, he did nothing that he did not really want to do, and all that he most wanted to do he did. He went all over the world, he owned a ranch, he lived in the most beautiful corners of Europe, and met whom he wanted to meet and told them that they were wrong <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> He painted and made things, and sang, and rode. He wrote something like three dozen books, of which even the worst page dances with life that could be mistaken for no other man's, while the best are admitted, even by those who hate him, to be unsurpassed. Without vices, with most human virtues, the husband of one wife, scrupulously honest, this estimable citizen yet managed to keep free from the shackles of civilization and the cant of literary cliques. He would have laughed lightly and cursed venomously in passing at the solemn owls—each one secretly chained by the leg—who now conduct his inquest. To do his work and lead his life in spite of them took some doing, but he did it, and long after they are forgotten, sensitive and innocent people—if any are left—will turn Lawrence's pages and will know from them what sort of a rare man Lawrence was."Aldous Huxley also defended Lawrence in his introduction to a collection of letters published in 1932. However, the most influential advocate of Lawrence's literary reputation was Cambridge literary critic F. R. Leavis, who asserted that the author had made an important contribution to the tradition of English fiction. Leavis stressed that The Rainbow, Women in Love, and the short stories and tales were major works of art. Later, the obscenity trials over the unexpurgated edition of Lady Chatterley's Lover in America in 1959, and in Britain in 1960, and subsequent publication of the full text, ensured Lawrence's popularity (and notoriety) with a wider public.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>right.</b> The duel <b>was</b> a bad affair, {{for the man}} almost died, and {{the baron}} barely managed {{to get out of}} the scrape through court influence. When is the wedding to be?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Ariel sighted the Bishop Light at 1:30 am on 5 September 1866. With all {{possible}} sail set, she sped toward {{the mouth of}} the English Channel. At daybreak, another ship was seen on the starboard quarter, also carrying every stitch of canvas that she could. Captain Keay of Ariel later said [...] "Instinct {{told me that it was}} the Taeping" [...] - <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> A strong west-southwesterly wind carried these two ships up the channel at 14 knots. The Lizard was abeam at 8:00 am and Start Point at noon. The two ships were off Portland towards 6:00 pm and St. Catherine's Point was due north at 7:25 pm. Beachy Head was abeam just after midnight. The relative positions of the two ships barely shifted all this while - Ariel kept her lead.|$|E
2500|$|Bruce Johnston {{explains}} that [...] "Brian really worked {{a lot on}} 'God Only Knows', and at one point, {{he had all the}} Beach Boys, Terry Melcher and two of the Rovell sisters [...] on it. It just got so overloaded; it was nuts. So he was smart enough to peel it all back, and he held voices back to the bridge, me at the top end, Carl in the middle and Brian on the bottom. At that point, Brian's right move was to get subtler. He had a very tender track here. 'God Only Knows' is a very small masterpiece with a major heartbeat, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> to peel everybody back and wind up with the three parts. In fact, it's probably the only well-known Beach Boys track that has just three voices on it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wary of the {{similarity}} between the main riff of [...] "Come as You Are" [...] and English post-punk band Killing Joke's 1984 single [...] "Eighties", Nirvana and its management were unsure about releasing the song as the second single from Nevermind. Danny Goldberg, head of Nirvana's management Gold Mountain, later revealed that [...] "e couldn't decide between 'Come as You Are' and 'In Bloom.' Kurt was nervous about 'Come as You Are' {{because it was too}} similar to a Killing Joke song but we all thought it was still the better song to go with. <b>And,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> Killing Joke later did complain about it." [...] Nirvana biographer Everett True writes that [...] "Come as You Are" [...] was eventually chosen for release as a single because [...] "Goldberg favoured the more obviously commercial song".|$|E

50|$|Holmes is {{sure that}} Miss Morrison holds {{the key to}} the mystery, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>right.</b> She claims to know nothing of the reason for the {{argument}} between her neighbors, but once told by Holmes that Nancy could easily face a murder charge, she feels that she can betray her promise to her and tells all.|$|R
6000|$|Now, my dear friends, you <b>are</b> partly <b>right,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> partly <b>right.</b> St. Paul {{will show}} you where you <b>are</b> <b>right</b> <b>and</b> where <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>right.</b> <b>He</b> does so, I think, in a certain noble text of his in which he says, 'I judge not mine own self; for I know nothing against myself, yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.' ...|$|R
2500|$|The band's {{publicist}} Ida Langsam {{agreed that}} the members and record company all {{felt the need to}} keep a strict budget on recording, production, and promotion of the Ramones' music. She pointed out that just because much of their album process was done [...] "cut-rate," [...] it did not mean that there performance on the album was not done well, but rather they were trying to find people and places who could do things cheaper, which was the reason the were recording at Intergalactic Studios as they did in their previous album, Animal Boy. Langsam {{went on to say that}} the Ramones were [...] "never afforded the respect a band of their caliber should have," [...] insisting that other bands who were [...] "much less worthy had more respect afforded them" [...] were often rewarded with more respect. [...] "Everybody thought of them as the local band," [...] she continued, [...] "everybody's friends—'when are you going to break, when are you going to get big, when are you going to reach stardom?'" [...] Rey claimed that the band was very impatient during the album process, and noted that members, especially Johnny and Joey, weren't getting along. [...] "John was fast in the studio," [...] recalls George Tabb, who was recording with his band the False Prophets at Intergalactic Studios at the same time as the Ramones recorded Halfway to Sanity. He called it humorous, [...] "because John would be going, 'Enough, enough, it sounds right.' And Joey, the artist, would go, 'I gotta do my vocals, I gotta do my vocals,' and the drummer's going, 'But my drums!' Johnny was like, 'Fuck it. It's the Ramones. It is what it is and comes out like that.' <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> It was the Ramones. He was a good businessman about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's Jed Sanborn!" [...] cried Snap, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> Soon the old hunter had beached {{his craft}} and was {{shaking hands with}} them.|$|E

50|$|The platoon gathers {{outside the}} hut with the tunnel, and rush in. But {{it is too}} late, they have already escaped through the tunnel. Pike deduces that it is {{underneath}} the stove, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>right.</b> Mainwaring takes Pike and Jones through the tunnel, while Wilson, Godfrey and Frazer will try to stop Walker from loading the men into the van.|$|R
50|$|The novel {{opens with}} Balzic {{back in a}} police car and feeling {{depressed}} about his mother's recent death. He gets {{a call from a}} woman who thinks her husband may be out to brutally exact revenge on a truck driver with a questionable past. She wants Balzic to stop the attack, but gives him little to go on. <b>He</b> senses there <b>is</b> more coming <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>right.</b>|$|R
5000|$|According to the {{grandson}} of Kgosi Mangope, when a Boer delegation asked about Mangope, Kgosi Setshele said, [...] "I have eaten him <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> inside me. You have to open me to get him." [...] Setshele then demanded that the Boers take off their shoes when speaking to a kgosi. Once they did, the Bakwena attacked, and since the ground was rough, the Boers {{had a hard time}} escaping and were killed.|$|R
6000|$|... "He feels at home now," [...] said Dick, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> The dog leaped up, {{first on}} {{one and then}} another, and licked their hands.|$|E

6000|$|... "He {{must be in}} trouble," [...] thought Dick, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> Soon {{the dispute}} waxed hot, {{and one of the}} men hit Baxter in the face.|$|E
6000|$|If I {{could get}} the {{management}} {{of one of those}} campaigns, I would know what to do, for I have studied the Boer. He values the Bible above every other thing. The most delicious edible in South Africa is [...] "biltong." [...] You will have seen it mentioned in Olive Schreiner's books. It is what our plainsmen call [...] "jerked beef." [...] It is the Boer's main standby. He has a passion for it, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>right.</b>|$|R

40|$|Professor Dowie {{has written}} an {{interesting}} and thought provoking paper on a long lasting debate {{in the literature on}} measuring health related quality of life. The debate between generic and condition specific measures (CSMs) has not progressed a great deal with time <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> to question a purely psychometric approach that currently tends to focuses on effect sizes. He has also presented an interesting challenge to the compromise solution suggested by a number of psychometricians to adopt both types of measure. ...|$|R

25|$|So, {{while the}} name Packer appears {{many times in}} the book, the only serious comment that the writer makes about the whole affair (<b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> in his comment) is ”In one respect, and in only one I think, he (Packer) has done a service to the game by forcing us all to face the fact cricketers have been abysmally ill-paid.” So, as a whole “The Best Loved Game” is not about any {{controversial}} issue, it is simply about cricket being part of the English summer.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> quite <b>right</b> too. <b>He</b> did {{sleep as}} he expected. Next morning he woke {{in a very}} good humour, and {{proceeded}} at once to Guy Waring's rooms the moment after breakfast.|$|R
