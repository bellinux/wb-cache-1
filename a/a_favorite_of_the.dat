5|$|At the German Embassy in Washington, D.C., on January 2, 1873, Savage {{married the}} aristocratic Anna Josephine Scheible, a German widow {{three years older}} than he who had arrived in war-torn America in 1864 with her first husband, Gustav, to look after family-owned land in Georgia. Gustav Scheible died in 1866 and Anna became <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Washington social circle. Her {{marriage}} to Savage produced one daughter, who later married Anatol de Carriere, a minor nobleman and an Imperial Russian Councilor of State.|$|E
5|$|Beshear faced no {{opposition}} in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, held on May 17, 2011. In the Republican primary, Senate President David Williams defeated Louisville businessman Phil Moffett, <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tea Party Movement, and Bobbie Holsclaw, county clerk of Jefferson County. Perennial candidate Gatewood Galbraith sought the governorship as an Independent after collecting the requisite 5,000 signatures from registered voters requesting that his name {{be added to the}} ballot.|$|E
5|$|Olaf {{sailed to}} Norway with Orn, a sea-captain and hirdman of King Harald Greycloak. He gained great honor at Harald's court, and was <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king's mother Gunnhild, who had, {{according}} to Icelandic sources, been the lover of Olaf's uncle Hrut Herjolfsson.

5|$|On June 10, 1880, Cabaniss {{graduated}} from the academy and was sent home to await his orders. He was assigned on August 17 of that year to the USS Swatara {{as a part of}} the Asiatic Squadron. For sixteen months, the ship was docked in Kobe, Japan, during which time Cabaniss earned himself a positive reputation with other sailors. Crew mates described him as always being happy, with an intimidating, six-foot-tall physique but a personality that did not match. His disciplined nature remained; he reportedly was one of the best-behaved sailors, who spent all of his time either carrying out his duties or practicing to be a better officer. Cabaniss was never admonished for shore misconduct, a considerable issue for most other new officers and sailors. He was reportedly <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superior officers stationed in Kobe, and was appointed to a spot on the admiral's staff as a reward for his conduct. Cabaniss was preparing for an examination for promotion early in February 1882.|$|E
5|$|The {{first chapter}} of Team of Rivals portrays four major contenders for the 1860 Republican presidential {{nomination}} on May 18, 1860, awaiting {{the results of the}} national convention by telegraph: New York Senator and former governor William H. Seward, widely considered the frontrunner; Ohio Governor Salmon P. Chase, <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party's more radical wing; former Missouri Attorney General Edward Bates, preferred by more conservative elements of the party; and Abraham Lincoln, a former U.S. Representative from Illinois. Goodwin then describes how each candidate rose to national political prominence: Seward through a long alliance with New York political boss Thurlow Weed, Chase through his early advocacy of the abolition of slavery, Bates through a speech opposing President James K. Polk at the 1847 River and Harbor Convention, and Lincoln through a series of debates with Democratic rival Stephen A. Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate election. Lincoln is ultimately the victor at the 1860 convention through a superior political operation and by making himself the unobjectionable second choice of all Republican factions, and proceeds to win the presidency.|$|E

25|$|Eliyahu was <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Baba Sali, {{who lived}} nearby in Netivot.

Not wishing to upset the holy man, Eliyahu accepted the invitation, only to find out later that a disgruntled ex-litigant had gone to the beth din seeking to do him harm.|$|E
25|$|After 1948, Bacalbașa's republicanism {{made him}} <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{communist}} regime. In the 1950s, his anti-monarchic work {{was central to}} the Romanian curriculum, alongside selected pieces by other hand-picked republicans-socialists (N. D. Cocea, Traian Demetrescu, Dumitru Theodor Neculuță, Alexandru Toma). However, the anonymous Moftul Român articles which were evidently pro-socialist, and which are most likely Toni's contributions, were attributed to Caragiale by official authors such as Camil Petrescu. This was a counter-factual effort of transforming the Junimist writer into a champion of the left.|$|E

25|$|During the Renaissance, Athena donned {{the mantle}} of patron {{of the arts and}} human endeavor; allegorical {{paintings}} involving Athena were <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Italian Renaissance painters. Athena was used as a symbol for female rulers, and a series of paintings by Peter Paul Rubens depict her as the patron of Marie de' Medici. During the French Revolution, statues of pagan gods were torn down all throughout France, but statues of Athena were not. Instead, Athena was transformed into the personification of freedom and the republic and a statue of the goddess stood {{in the center of the}} Place de la Revolution in Paris. In the years following the Revolution, artistic representations of Athena proliferated.|$|E
25|$|Positioned {{with its}} open mouth toward the enemy advance, this was <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VC. It {{was used in}} both fairly open terrain as well as jungle. The ambushers, in good {{concealment}} along {{the legs of the}} 'V', would wait until the enemy point had passed and then creep close to the trail. The 'V' ambush was virtually undetectable by enemy point or flank security until at least a portion of the enemy force was in the kill zone. Enfilading fire was often directed down the enemy axis of advance, and interlocking fire from each leg across the 'V'. The 'V' ambush also lent itself to the use of controlled mines and booby traps.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday, November 24, 1963, Jacqueline Kennedy {{requested}} {{an eternal}} flame for her husband's grave. According to several published accounts, she {{drew inspiration from}} a number of sources. One was the eternal flame at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, which {{she and her husband had}} seen during a visit to France in 1961. She also took inspiration from the novel The Candle in the Wind (the fourth book from the collection The Once and Future King by T. H. White), which was part of the inspiration for the 1960 stage musical Camelot (the cast recording was <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kennedys). Her brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, counseled against an eternal flame, worried that it might appear ostentatious or that it would compete with other such memorials at Arlington National Cemetery. But Mrs. Kennedy was adamant.|$|E

500|$|Growing up in a Jewish-American {{household}} {{where the}} parents demanded high achievement, Juster was intimately familiar with expectations, though {{in his case}} many of his parents' hopes were centered on his older brother, an academic star. The Terrible Trivium, the well-dressed, polite demon who sets the questers to mindless tasks, was Juster's way of representing his own tendency to avoid what he should be doing {{in favor of a}} more congenial occupation, such as his evasion of the grant project to write The Phantom Tollbooth. Juster drew on Feiffer's life experiences as well; the Whether Man's adage [...] "Expect everything, I always say, and the unexpected never happens" [...] was <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cartoonist's mother.|$|E

500|$|In 1979, Keating {{served as}} head of {{fundraising}} in the Southwest for John Connally's campaign for the 1980 Republican Party presidential nomination. Connally was <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> business community, but his campaign had difficulty parlaying its fundraising successes into popular support. In early December 1979, Keating was named campaign manager, with the existing manager being demoted to campaign strategist. Keating's first action was as a [...] "pruner" [...] who immediately fired twenty workers at the campaign's Virginia headquarters. The campaign continued to struggle, and, by late February 1980, Keating was out as manager, with Connally taking the role. Connally's campaign ended two weeks later, famously known for having spent $11 million and gaining only one delegate.|$|E
500|$|... "Tithonus" [...] {{was written}} by Vince Gilligan, who based aspects of it on three real aspects of history. The name Alfred Fellig is a {{reference}} to famous photographer Arthur Fellig, better known as Weegee. The title of the episode is {{a reference to the}} Greek myth of Tithonus. Tithonus was the son the king of Troy and <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Titan goddess Eos. She later kidnapped him to be her lover and asked Zeus to make Tithonus immortal. Eos, however, forgot to ask for eternal youth and Tithonus indeed lived forever but prayed every sunrise for death. The final aspect of history used by Gilligan was the yellow fever epidemic in the 19th century.|$|E
500|$|The {{northern}} mockingbird is an omnivore. The birds' diet consists of arthropods, earthworms, berries, fruits, seeds, and seldom, lizards. Mockingbirds can drink from puddles, river and lake edges, or dew and rain droplets that amass onto plants. Adult mockingbirds {{also have been}} seen drinking sap from the cuts on recently pruned trees. Its diet heavily consists of animal prey during the breeding season, but takes a drastic shift to fruits during the fall and winter. The drive for fruits amid winter has been noted for the geographic expansion of the mockingbird, and in particular, the fruit of Rosa multiflora, <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> birds, is a possible link. [...] Mockingbirds also eat garden fruits such as tomatoes, apples, and berries.|$|E
