40|$|In {{this short}} report, we discuss how coordinate-wise descent {{algorithms}} {{can be used}} to solve minimum variance portfolio (MVP) problems in which the portfolio weights are constrained by l_q norms, where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2. A portfolio which weights are regularised by such norms is called a sparse portfolio (Brodie et al.), since these constraints facilitate sparsity (zero components) of the weight vector. We first consider a case when the portfolio weights are regularised by a weighted l_ 1 and squared l_ 2 norm. Then two benchmark data sets (Fama and French 48 industries and 100 size and BM ratio portfolios) are used to examine performances of the sparse portfolios. When the sample size is not relatively large to the number of assets, sparse portfolios tend to have lower out-of-sample portfolio variances, turnover rates, <b>active</b> <b>assets,</b> short-sale positions, but higher Sharpe ratios than the unregularised MVP. We then show some possible extensions; particularly we derive an efficient algorithm for solving an MVP problem in which assets are allowed to be chosen grouply. ...|$|E

40|$|This work {{attempts}} to bridge economic and organizational assessment methodologies {{to evaluate the}} economic impact of individual competencies on value creation process. Competencies are considered as <b>active</b> <b>assets</b> needed to nurture value creation in key organization processes (critical capabilities). The aim of the paper is to propose a methodology to compute the cost-value ratio related to the acquisition or development competencies in a given organizational process. The methodology integrates a multi-attribute decision making method (Analytic Hierarchical Process - AHP) and cost accounting techniques (Activity Based Costing - ABC) to compute the cost and a real option technique to estimate the value of competencies. In particular, a fuzzy real option model is presented. The proposed methodology is {{based on the idea that}} acquiring/developing a competence Ci is equivalent to purchasing an option allowing a firm to implement a specific productive process Pj. This, the value of Ci can be estimated from the economic value that the process Pj generates. Fuzzy logic is used to estimate the value of option volatility based on imprecise data as linguistic assertions and estimations provided by process experts.

On the historical data and under {{the existence of the}} proportional transactions costs, we verify the impact of stocks number in portfolio and transaction costs on the selected replication methods of passive and active asset management strategies, namely replication with daily and controlled restructuring and the method with penalization of transaction costs. We also determined which selected replication method is the most precise in the sense of benchmark replication and we give several general recommendations for benchmark replication strategy including the eligible proportion of replicating portfolio on the market capitalization with respect to the target replication accuracy. Firstly, the Tracking Error methodology and its application in asset management are presented and optimization problem of particular replication methods is formulated in the next part of the paper. In the application part, the replication accuracy is analyzed and the quality of benchmark replication is verified on the Czech index PX-GLOB during the period of the year 2007. It emerged during our experiment that under the condition of passive asset management strategy the replicating portfolios with the proportion of the market capitalization on the benchmark at the level 70 – 85 % give very good results. Moreover we conclude that the method with penalization of transaction costs is the most precise replication method from the selected and analyzed methods of <b>active</b> <b>assets</b> management strategy...|$|E

40|$|Effective Space Asset Management is {{one key to}} {{addressing}} the ever-growing issue of space congestion. It is imperative that agencies {{around the world have}} access to data regarding the numerous <b>active</b> <b>assets</b> and pieces of space junk currently tracked in orbit around the Earth. At the center of this issues is the effective management of data of many types related to orbiting objects. As the population of tracked objects grows, so too should the data management structure used to catalog technical specifications, orbital information, and metadata related to those populations. Marshall Space Flight Center's Space Asset Management Database (SAM-D) was implemented in order to effectively catalog a broad set of data related to known objects in space by ingesting information from a variety of database and processing that data into useful technical information. Using the universal NORAD number as a unique identifier, the SAM-D processes two-line element data into orbital characteristics and cross-references this technical data with metadata related to functional status, country of ownership, and application category. The SAM-D began as an Excel spreadsheet and was later upgraded to an Access database. While SAM-D performs its task very well, it is limited by its current platform and is not available outside of the local user base. Further, while modeling and simulation can be powerful tools to exploit the information contained in SAM-D, the current system does not allow proper integration options for combining the data with both legacy and new M&S tools. This paper provides a summary of SAM-D development efforts to date and outlines a proposed data management infrastructure that extends SAM-D to support the larger data sets to be generated. A service-oriented architecture model using an information sharing platform named SIMON will allow it to easily expand to incorporate new capabilities, including advanced analytics, M&S tools, fusion techniques and user interface for visualizations. In addition, tight control of information sharing policy will increase confidence in the system, which would encourage industry partners to provide commercial data. Combined with the integration of new and legacy M&S tools, a SIMON-based architecture will provide a robust environment that can be extended and expanded indefinitely...|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} the Behaviour Demand Response approach {{proposed in the}} context of the EU Horizon 2020 E 2 District project, which aims at achieving energy efficiency in District Heating and Cooling (DHC) systems applied in building blocks. Behaviour Demand Response (BDR) can be understood as the attempt to adjust the demand for power in accordance with supply side constraints, instead of adjusting the supply side alone without considering the potential flexibility of the demand. In contrast to this, typical current energy systems assume a rather strict distinction between a consumer driven demand side behaviour on one end and a matching supply side, usually provided by the energy grid, on the other end, with the primary objective of always satisfying consumer demands regardless of the constraints on the supply side. Demand side behaviour has always been modelled by energy suppliers to adapt production accordingly. There have been always incentive schemes in place to influence demand side behaviour like different tariffs according to supply side constrains. However, nowadays modern communication technology enables a much more granular and individualised approach. By including the building occupants in the energy optimisation process and considering their ability to interact with the environment as flexibility asset we are aiming to go beyond what purely technical solutions can achieve. The approach proposed here aims at modelling demand behaviour not only as an external factor to the system, but by incorporating the individual building occupant and his/her characteristics as an integral part of the system itself. We propose to use a rigorous behavioural model to translate dynamic supply side constrains into adequate prosumer interactions, taking all relevant behavioural aspects like motivation, intention, personal traits and environment/context parameters into account. This model-based optimisation approach enables to target the right person at the right time in the right place with the right message/suggestion, dynamically involving the building occupant in the process as active participant/prosumer. This shifts the paradigm in the sense that occupants are not just consumers of energy anymore, but through their behaviour and how systems works today they can become producers of energy, too, the so called prosumers. This can either be through the availability of local production systems, like CHPs, but it is not limited to a situation where building occupants have production assets at their disposal. From the perspective of the overall energy grid, also the flexibility of their consumption creates a role as <b>active</b> <b>assets</b> in the systems, as soon as it is possible to engage with them and influence their behaviour according to supply side constraints...|$|E

E é sobre estes princípios que este trabalho é baseado, ou seja, pretende-se através da aplicação de ferramentas Lean, a melhoria contínua do processo de produção da Schmitt Elevadores. Numa fase inicial foi necessário um estudo dos diferentes fluxos de materiais, que permitiu a conceção do VSM (Value Stream Mapping). O VSM juntamente com o diagrama de Spaghetti permitiram a identificação de algumas das fontes de desperdício, relacionadas essencialmente com o excesso de movimentações. Considerando o âmbito do estágio, logística interna, e reunidas as causas de desperdício verificadas nesta área, procedeu-se à criação de um ciclo de entrega de materiais, por parte do operador logístico, baseado no conceito de milk run. Verificaram-se também problemas ao nível da gestão de stocks, pelo que também foi necessária intervenção nesta área. A aplicação das medidas mencionadas anteriormente irá traduzir-se em ganhos para o processo produtivo, nomeadamente, na criação de rotinas para os operadores logísticos; evitar deslocações por parte dos operadores de cada processo e manter em supermercado a quantidade suficiente de cada artigo, para fazer face à variabilidade da procura.
