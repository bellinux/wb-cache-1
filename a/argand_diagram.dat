40|$|In the {{application}} of x-ray standing wave (XSW) methods to the determination of surface structures, the experiment provides two structural parameters: the coherent position and the coherent fraction. For simple, single-high-symmetry-site adsorption systems, the interpretation of these parameters {{in terms of a}} structural model is trivial, {{but in the case of}} lower-symmetry adsorption sites, or multiple adsorption sites (including those associated with coincidence lattice structures), these parameters are related to spatial distribution functions through a Fourier integral. A particularly simple way of viewing this result, in terms of vector (<b>Argand)</b> <b>diagrams,</b> allows many simple cases and general theorems concerning the interconnection of the structure and the XSW fitting parameters to be visualized.

5000|$|In {{a regular}} complex polytope the {{vertices}} incident {{on the edge}} are arranged symmetrically about their centroid, which is often used as {{the origin of the}} edge's coordinate system (in the real case the centroid is just the midpoint of the edge). The symmetry arises from a complex reflection about the centroid; this reflection will leave the magnitude of any vertex unchanged, but change its argument by a fixed amount, moving it to the coordinates of the next vertex in order. So we may assume (after a suitable choice of scale) that the vertices on the edge satisfy the equation [...] where p is the number of incident vertices. Thus, in the <b>Argand</b> <b>diagram</b> of the edge, the vertex points lie at the vertices of a regular polygon centered on the origin.|$|E
40|$|Although real {{numbers are}} su cient for most {{applications}} of field computation, complex numbers are sometimes required, as in Fourier analysis {{and the application}} of field computation is in quantum computation. Therefore the goal of this chapter is to provide an intuitive understanding of basic complex analysis, especially as it applies in Hilbert spaces; a systematic presentation of complex analysis is beyond its scope. In addition to standard material, this chapter includes a brief discussion of hyperbolic trigonometry and its applications in special relativity theory, which is intended to build intuition by stressing the analogies with ordinary (circular) trigonometry. 4. 1 <b>Argand</b> <b>diagram</b> As everyone knows, complex numbers involve i = p 1. However, it will be better at this point to forget about p 1 and understand complex numbers by means of the <b>Argand</b> <b>diagram</b> (Fig. 4. 1).

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{magnetic}} relaxation of monodispersed 4 nm cubic epsilon-cobalt nanocrystals in both randomly oriented and pre-aligned assemblies. The blocking temperature T-B, for the closely packed Co nanocrystal assemblies, is 30 % {{higher than that of}} the highly diluted and well-dispersed Co nanocrystal-organic composites. This increase is attributed to the strong magnetic dipole interaction induced from the close packing of the nanocrystals. It is found that the frequency-dependent susceptibility data, obtained from the diluted samples, can be fitted to the half-circle <b>Argand</b> <b>Diagrams,</b> indicating a single barrier (or very narrow energy distribution) of the nanocrystals. This agrees well with the physical observation from TEM that the nanocrystals are monodispersed.
