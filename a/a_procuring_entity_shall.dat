40|$|When {{government}} <b>entities</b> <b>procure</b> {{goods or}} services, they generally consider and award contracts only to bidders who {{complied with the}} specifications and conditions of tender as laid down in the tender invitation. Tenders received must in other words be conforming, compliant or responsive. This enables <b>procuring</b> <b>entities</b> to compare tenders {{on an equal footing}} and ensures equal treatment amongst bidders. In South Africa the extent to which bidders must comply with tender specifications and conditions is a thorny issue in practice. In 2008 the Supreme Court of Appeal in Millennium Waste Management (Pty) Ltd v Chairperson, Tender Board: Limpopo Province confirmed the views of the courts in South Africa regarding compliance with tender conditions and the amendment of tenders before award. The recent 2013 decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal in Dr JS Moroka Municipality v The Chairperson of the Tender Evaluation Committee of the Dr JS Moroka Municipality, however, has moved public procurement regulation in South Africa to <b>a</b> point where <b>procuring</b> <b>entities</b> have very limited discretionary powers when evaluating compliance with tender specifications and conditions. This paper argues for an approach that allows <b>procuring</b> <b>entities</b> in South Africa more discretion when evaluating compliance with tender specifications and conditions. In doing so, reliance is placed on the treatment of "responsiveness" in international instruments as well as the views of the South African courts since first they were confronted with the issue. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The paper aims {{to improve}} upon the highly unconcretised works {{contract}} performance research, {{by examining the}} relationships between contract management, inter-functional coordination, trust and works contract performance and whether these variables {{have an effect on}} the contract performance. Design/methodology/approach – This study is cross-sectional and correlational. It also takes the descriptive and analytical design. Data were collected from a representative sample of 108 completed and fully documented works contracts in the central government <b>procuring</b> and disposing <b>entities</b> in Uganda, in the financial year 2013 / 2014. Out of these, responses from 64 were used for analysis, using the Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS). Findings – The results suggest that delivery management is relatively more important than relation management and contract management and that in a rules based system, the importance of inter-functional coordination to contract performance is minimal, further expounding on the critical difference between private and public procurement systems. Originality/value – This study, unlike other studies in developing countries, considers individual issues of contract performance rather than holistic performance of <b>a</b> <b>procuring</b> and disposing <b>entity.</b> Works contract...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{triggered}} {{by the fact that}} the government has made number of efforts in addressing weaknesses in the public procurement process. However there still complaints that public procurement processes are characterized by delays, poor quality and non cost effective delivery. This study sought to analyze procurement processes in achieving effectiveness of the public procurement system. The study focused on <b>procuring</b> <b>entities</b> based in Dar es Salaam due to budget constraints and existence of major <b>procuring</b> <b>entities</b> in terms of procurement volume. Explanatory research design was used to analyse the procurement proceses. The study used structured questionnaires and interviews as primary tools for data collection. A total of 119 respondents out of the expected 155 respondents returned the survey instruments. The study revealed that <b>procuring</b> <b>entities</b> do not conduct market survey for establishing cost estimates, inadequate users cooperation with PMU staff and poor solicitation documents due to inadequate technical specifications, schedule of requirements, and drawings and poor terms and conditions of contract. The weak evaluation critieria and inadequate tender evaluations, and delays in contract awards are hampering efficient procurement process which results to ineffective procurement system. Furthermore weak controls in procurement contracts for payments to delivery of substandard goods or services and delays of due payments to suppliers or contractors and generally poor contract management were noted. The study recommends that <b>procuring</b> <b>entities</b> should conduct market survey for cost estimates of major procurements and enhance cooperation between User Departmemnts and PMU staff...|$|R

40|$|Combinatorial {{procurement}} auctions are desirable as they enable bidding {{firms to}} pass their potential cost synergies {{on to the}} <b>procuring</b> <b>entity</b> and {{may lead to a}} reduction in cost for the <b>procuring</b> <b>entity</b> and enhancing efficiency. However, an assessment of the benefits of the combinatorial mechanism, based on the observed package discounts, is likely to overstate the true cost savings generated by the mechanism. The option for a firm to submit bids on bundles of contracts gives rise to a strategic effect because a firm’s stand-alone bids compete with its package bids. Therefore, bidders might find it profitable to inflate their stand-alone bids in order to favour their package bids. Using data from first-price procurement auctions of single and multiple contracts, with and without the option to submit package bids, we find that firms inflate their stand alone bids in the combinatorial auctions compared to their corresponding bids in standard first-price procurement auctions. Further, the analysis does not show significant differences in the procurer’s cost by type of auction. Combinatorial procurement auctions; Contract bidding...|$|R
40|$|Summary Europe’s public {{authorities}} are influential consumers. If {{they spend their}} money on greener products and services they can make {{an important contribution to}} the work towards a sustainable development. Green public procurement can thereby significantly improve the take-up of new environmental technologies. Through the effects of economies of scale, production costs be lowered and better equip us to fight environmental problems. The EU’s new Public Procurement Directives of 2004 was implemented in the Swedish legislation in January 2008. The new legislation makes clear that public purchasers can include environmental criteria in their tender documents. The legislation mainly consists of a codification of case law and has not significantly increased the allowance of environmental award criteria. According to practicing procurers the changes in the legal framework however contribute to transparency legality when using environmental criterions. However, major barriers to green public procurement still exist. Because of legal uncertainty and the <b>procuring</b> <b>entities</b> lack of knowledge, environmental criterions are often poorly formulated. The main task of this essay is to describe and analyze to what extent <b>procuring</b> <b>entities</b> may use environmental award criteria. One of the main problems with environmental standards in public procurement is the inconsistency that may rise with fundamental European community principles such as non-discrimination and free movement. The public procurement legal framework is written with a strictly economical approach with aiming to maximize the utility for the <b>procuring</b> <b>entity,</b> and thereby the tax payers. At the same time the legislation aims to increase the competition between potential dealers in the market. Since public funds finances the procurement the idea is that the bid which is that the economically most advantageous bid shall be awarded. However, the doctrine and the legal framework has developed in order to adapt to the increased environmental awareness in society and enable for <b>procuring</b> <b>entities</b> to show environmental considerations. Even though economical liberalism is the foundation of the European Union, environmental protection and consideration must be respected. The ECJ has made clear that {{public authorities}} can use environmental criterions in their public procurement. As long as the criterions are well formulated the procuring great room exists to use environmental award criteria. Especially when the purpose of the award criteria is to reach an environmental goal set up by the union. Because of the lack of a precise procurement framework the courts have the power to decide upon the final limits and allowance of environmental award criteria...|$|R
