5|$|The {{conversation}} {{poems are}} {{a group of}} eight poems composed by Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834) between 1795 and 1807. Each details a particular life experience {{which led to the}} poet's examination of nature and the role of poetry. They describe virtuous conduct and man's obligation to God, nature and society, and ask <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a place for simple appreciation of nature without having to actively dedicate one's life to altruism.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the caps}} {{are covered by}} a peridium—an outer {{covering}} layer of tissue. After the fruit body matures and begins to dry out, {{the lower part of}} the peridium starts to rip, usually starting from small longitudinal slits near where the peridium attaches to the top of the stem. However, the pattern of tearing is variable; in some instances, the slits may appear higher up on the peridium, in others, the peridium rips more irregularly. The peridium may also rip in such a way that it appears <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a ring at the top of the stem. The torn peridium exposes the internal gleba. The gleba is divided into wavy plates or lamellae, some of which are fused together to form irregular chambers. The gleba is a drab brown to blackish-brown color, and it becomes tough and brittle as it dries out. The flesh is firm when young, white, and will stain light to bright yellow when it is bruised.|$|E

This ultrasound-based scan of the heart may help identify valvular heart disease (which may greatly increase the risk of stroke), left and right atrial size (which indicates likelihood that AF may become permanent), left ventricular size and function, peak right ventricular pressure (pulmonary hypertension), presence of left atrial thrombus (low sensitivity), presence of left ventricular hypertrophy and pericardial disease.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1993, a {{commentator}} {{reflected on the}} situation as follows: [...] "The President issues decrees <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no Supreme Soviet, and the Supreme Soviet suspends decrees <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no President." [...] (Izvestiya, August 13, 1993).|$|R

500|$|The film {{presents}} a legal system where the PreCrime office gathers the {{images from the}} minds of the precogs then organizes them into a coherent order for display in front of a set of judges. The judges appear via video feeds, analyze the images, and according to Cooper, they view the images, listen to Anderton rattle off [...] "a string of legalistic verbiage", then give it a [...] "pro forma ratification." [...] Thus the accused is never present, is not allowed a defense, and is convicted before he is aware he is on trial. The program is marketed in a similar basic fashion, as in its tag line: [...] "It works." [...] Cooper says that in a typical American courtroom drama, the audience is treated {{as if it were the}} jury, but in this system, instead of desiring the hero be proven innocent, the audience seeks instead to have the guilt transferred from Anderton to Burgess. But to do so, Anderton has to disprove the system, which he does by proving the existence of the minority report. This renders the PreCrime justice system inoperable, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> doubt related not merely to the gathering of the images, or their ability to be interpreted, but their ability to be correct even in perfect circumstances, then the system of infallible guilt can not exist.|$|E
2500|$|However, in the White Paper of 1939, the British {{government}} under Neville Chamberlain abandoned {{the idea of}} establishing a Jewish Commonwealth. When the Second World War began in September 1939, David Ben-Gurion, {{the head of the}} Jewish Agency, famously declared: [...] "We will fight the White Paper <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no war, and fight the war <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no White Paper." ...|$|E
2500|$|Slide {{dampening}} {{can be used}} {{to dampen}} a note that is physically adjacent to the new note being struck. [...] The player strikes the new note and then controls the rebound of the mallet so that it slides over and onto the note to be dampened. [...] Sometimes slide dampening can make the new note sound [...] "bent" [...] or <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a glissando from the dampened note to the ringing one, as the two notes normally ring together for some short period of time.|$|E

The proposal has been made in bad faith, ... as Fitna, meaning [...] "mischief-making" [...] that is clearly forbidden in the Koran.... As Muslims we are dismayed that our co-religionists have such little consideration for their fellow citizens, and wish to rub salt in their wounds and pretend they are applying a balm to soothe the pain.|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{look upon}} {{authority}} too often and focus {{over and over}} again, for 30 or 40 or 50 years, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> something wrong with authority. We see only the oppressive side of authority. Maybe {{it comes out of}} our history and our background. What we don't see is that freedom is not a concept in which people can do anything they want, be anything they can be. Freedom is about authority. Freedom is about the willingness of every single human being to cede to lawful authority a great deal of discretion about what you do. [...] You have free speech so I can be heard." [...] Giuliani in a March 1994 speech on crime at a forum in New York City sponsored by the New York Post as quoted by The New York Times ...|$|E
2500|$|He also {{denied the}} {{existence}} of absolute space and time by saying in 1901: [...] "1. There is no absolute space, and we only conceive of relative motion and yet in most cases mechanical facts are enunciated <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an absolute space to which they can be referred. 2. There is no absolute time. When we say that two periods are equal, the statement has no meaning, and can only acquire a meaning by a convention. 3. Not only have we no direct intuition of the equality of two periods, {{but we have not}} even direct intuition of the simultaneity of two events occurring in two different places. I have explained this in an article entitled [...] "Mesure du Temps" [...] 4. Finally, is not our Euclidean geometry in itself only a kind of convention of language?" ...|$|E

50|$|By 1939, the British {{had issued}} the White Paper, which {{severely}} restricted Jewish immigration to Palestine, deeply angering the Zionist leadership. David Ben-Gurion, then {{chairman of the}} Jewish Agency, set the policy for the Zionist relationship with the British: We shall fight the war against Hitler <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no White Paper, and we shall fight the White Paper <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no war.|$|R

2500|$|Ethologists {{and others}} {{writing in the}} 1960s and 1970s {{questioned}} the types of behaviour used as indications of attachment, and offered alternative approaches. For example, crying on separation from a familiar person was suggested as an index of attachment. Observational studies of young children in natural settings also provided behaviours that might be considered to indicate attachment; for example, staying within a predictable distance of the mother without effort on her part and picking up small objects and bringing them to the mother, but usually not other adults. Although ethological work tended to be in agreement with Bowlby, work like that just described led {{to the conclusion that}} [...] "e appear to disagree with Bowlby and Ainsworth on some of the details of the child's interactions with its mother and other people". Some ethologists pressed for further observational data, arguing that psychologists [...] "are still writing <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a real entity which is 'attachment', existing over and above the observable measures." ...|$|E
2500|$|AMD changed cache design {{significantly}} with the Thunderbird core. With the older Athlon CPUs, the CPU caching was of an inclusive design where {{data from the}} L1 is duplicated in the L2 cache. Thunderbird moved to an exclusive design where the L1 cache's contents are not duplicated in the L2. This increases total cache size of the processor and effectively makes caching behave <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a very large L1 cache with a slower region (the L2) and a very fast region (the L1). Because of Athlon's very large L1 cache and the exclusive design, which turns the L2 cache into basically a [...] "victim cache", the need for high L2 performance and size was lessened. AMD kept the 64-bit L2 cache data bus from the older Athlons, as a result, and allowed it to have a relatively high latency. A simpler L2 cache reduced {{the possibility of the}} L2 cache causing clock scaling and yield issues. Still, instead of the 2-way associative scheme used in older Athlons, Thunderbird did move to a more efficient 16-way associative layout.|$|E
2500|$|Gabbard {{previously}} opposed both {{civil unions}} and same-sex marriage. As a Hawaii state legislator in 2004, she argued against civil unions, saying, [...] "To try to act <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{a difference between}} 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful {{to the people of}} Hawaii who have already made overwhelmingly clear our position on this issue... As Democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists." [...] Gabbard opposed Hawaii House Bill 1024, which would have established legal parity between same-sex couples in civil unions and married straight couples, and led a protest against the bill outside the room where the House Judiciary Committee held the hearing. In the same year, Gabbard expressed her opposition to Hawaii undertaking research on LGBT students, arguing {{that it would be a}} violation of their privacy and that [...] "many parents would see the study as an indirect attempt by government to encourage young people to question their sexual orientation". At the time, she disputed that Hawaii schools were rampant with anti-gay discrimination.|$|E

5000|$|When the Second World War broke out, the Jewish {{population}} {{sided with}} Britain.
