Cui continued to write negative reviews of Tchaikovsky's music but was seen by the composer <b>as</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> critical irritant. Balakirev lived in isolation and was confined to the musical sidelines. Only Rimsky-Korsakov remained fully active as a composer.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the series, Jackson {{had thought}} of her singing <b>as</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> private hobby. The Jacksons {{as well as an}} early love of musicals—motivated her to become a {{professional}} recording artist, and the show's producer encouraged her to sing. Jackson served as a backing vocalist for several musicians around this time, as well as a cabaret singer. She contributed her voice for songs by artists such as The Emotions, Sonny Bono, and Betty Wright before Jackson's second pregnancy stalled her musical career for a short time.|$|E
5|$|Yamhad had a {{distinctive}} Syrian iconography, which is {{clear in the}} seals of the kings that gave prominence to the Syrian gods. Egyptian influence was minimal and limited to the ankh, which cannot be interpreted as an emulation of Egyptian rituals but rather <b>as</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> substitute for the cup held by the deity elsewhere. Yamhad had a special pattern of trim called the Yamhad style, which was favored in Mari {{during the reign of}} king Zimri-Lim, whose queen Shibtu was the daughter of Yarim-Lim I.|$|E

2500|$|The {{objection}} to the objectification of women is not a recent phenomenon. In the French Enlightenment, for example, there was a debate as to whether a woman's breasts were <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> sensual enticement or rather a natural gift. In Alexandre Guillaume Mouslier de Moissy's 1771 play The True Mother (La Vraie Mère), the title character rebukes her husband for treating her <b>as</b> <b>merely</b> <b>an</b> object for his sexual gratification: [...] "Are your senses so gross as to look on these breasts [...] the respectable treasures of nature [...] <b>as</b> <b>merely</b> <b>an</b> embellishment, destined to ornament the chest of women?" ...|$|R

5|$|Alboin first {{distinguished}} {{himself on}} the battlefield in a clash with the Gepids. At the Battle of Asfeld (552), he killed Turismod, son of the Gepid king Thurisind, in a victory {{that resulted in the}} Emperor Justinian's intervention to maintain equilibrium between the rival regional powers. After the battle, according to a tradition reported by Paul the Deacon, to be granted the right to sit at his father's table, Alboin had to ask for the hospitality of a foreign king and have him donate his weapons, as was customary. For this initiation, he went to the court of Thurisind, where the Gepid king gave him Turismod's arms. Walter Goffart believes it is probable that in this narrative Paul was making use of an oral tradition, and is sceptical that it can be dismissed <b>as</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> typical topos of an epic poem.|$|E
5|$|Three {{different}} early {{versions of}} the play are extant: the First Quarto (Q1, 1603); the Second Quarto (Q2, 1604); and the First Folio (F1, 1623). Each version includes lines and entire scenes missing from the others. The play's structure and depth of characterisation have inspired much critical scrutiny. One such example is the centuries-old debate about Hamlet's hesitation to kill his uncle, which some see <b>as</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> plot device to prolong the action, but which others argue is a dramatisation of the complex philosophical and ethical issues that surround cold-blooded murder, calculated revenge, and thwarted desire. More recently, psychoanalytic critics have examined Hamlet's unconscious desires, while feminist critics have re-evaluated and attempted to rehabilitate the often maligned characters of Ophelia and Gertrude.|$|E
5|$|Tin Machine's {{first world}} tour was a {{commercial}} success, {{but there was}} growing reluctance—among fans and critics alike—to accept Bowie's presentation <b>as</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> band member. A series of Tin Machine singles failed to chart, and Bowie, after a disagreement with EMI, left the label. Like his audience and his critics, Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role as just one member of a band. Tin Machine began work on a second album, but Bowie put the venture on hold and made a return to solo work. Performing his early hits during the seven-month Sound+Vision Tour, he found commercial success and acclaim once again.|$|E

50|$|Channing being {{a medical}} {{physician}} looked at electric wires {{and the human}} nervous system as resembling each other. He looked at this first fire-alarm system <b>as</b> <b>merely</b> <b>an</b> application of the fundamentals of self-preservation that is found throughout nature.|$|R
5|$|Arkane were {{influenced}} by some criticisms of the first Dishonored. Although the difficulty was not considered a major problem, a sizeable number of players had complained the first was too easy, and thus the harder difficulty settings were reworked. The chaos system of Dishonored, considered <b>as</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> binary ersatz meter, was intended more depth in the sequel. The altered chaos system, where different individuals grant varying amounts of chaos, was implemented due to how many players used the Heart in the original game. As the Heart would reveal secrets about whomever it was pointed at, players would use it to decide which NPCs to kill and which to leave be or spare. Also intended to yield additional improvements was the upgrade system, which would {{for the first time}} level up based on a skill tree. Bonecharms were made into craftable items, with 400,000 possible combinations available. While taking into account the intricacies of how supernatural abilities would be used, designers faced increased difficulty in relation to the play-style where the game is traversed in their absence, noting the accommodation of the play-style {{in a way that would}} not cancel out the other as a challenge.|$|E

25|$|Satanist {{groups that}} {{appeared}} after the 1960s are widely diverse, but two major trends are theistic Satanism and atheistic Satanism. Theistic Satanists venerate Satan as a supernatural deity, viewing him not as omnipotent {{but rather as}} a patriarch. In contrast, atheistic Satanists regard Satan <b>as</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> symbol of certain human traits.|$|E
5000|$|Families and {{marriage}} have increasingly become areas where gender matters. However, {{it is important}} to note that gender differences in marriage have too often been perceived <b>as</b> <b>merely</b> <b>an</b> [...] "individual struggle and depoliticized by reducing social inequalities to differences".|$|R
5000|$|According to Hesychius [...] and Strabo, Agdistis is {{the same}} as Cybele, who was worshiped at Pessinus under that name. In many ancient inscriptions, Agdistis is clearly {{distinct}} from Cybele, but in many others she is listed <b>as</b> <b>merely</b> <b>an</b> epithet of Cybele.|$|R

25|$|The October Revolution of 1917—in which Bolshevik communists led by Vladimir Lenin {{seized power}} in Russia—greatly {{influenced}} {{the development of}} fascism. In 1917, Mussolini, {{as leader of the}} Fasci of Revolutionary Action, praised the October Revolution, but later he became unimpressed with Lenin, regarding him <b>as</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> new version of Tsar Nicholas. After World War I, fascists have commonly campaigned on anti-Marxist agendas.|$|E
25|$|Teti's {{position}} in Coptos {{has been identified}} variously as a haty-a or <b>as</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> temple official. James H. Breasted argued that the Coptos Decree must be read as ordering the demotion of a count and installing his replacement. Alternatively, Katja Goebs argues that Teti probably had never been the haty-a, since the titles the Coptos Decree stripped him of were purely temple offices.|$|E
25|$|The Second Taranaki War is a {{term used}} by some historians {{for the period of}} {{hostilities}} between Māori and the New Zealand Government in the Taranaki district of New Zealand between 1863 and 1866. The term is avoided by some historians, who either describe the conflicts <b>as</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> series of West Coast campaigns that took place between the Taranaki War (1860–1861) and Titokowaru's War (1868–69), or an extension of the First Taranaki War.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, rugby union went {{professional}}, {{and those}} who had long derided rugby league <b>as</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> professional version of that game were soon predicting the demise of the sport. The Super League war, the financial problems of the 2000 Rugby League World Cup and the signing of several high-profile rugby league stars by the union game gave ammunition to this claim. However, in reality the 13-man game proved far more resilient.|$|E
25|$|In United States {{business}} law, a forward-looking statement or {{safe harbor}} statement {{is a statement}} that cannot sustain itself <b>as</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> historical fact. A forward-looking statement predicts, projects, or uses future events as expectations or possibilities. These statements can often be misleading, {{as they can be}} mistaken for factual statements, while they are actually speculation. According to United States Code 15 Section 78u-5, a forward-looking statement may include future economic performance such as revenues or income, plans for future operations, or use of a report written by an outside reviewer.|$|E
25|$|The auto-da-fé {{involved}} a Catholic Mass, prayer, a public procession of those found guilty, and {{a reading of}} their sentences. They took place in public squares or esplanades and lasted several hours; ecclesiastical and civil authorities attended. Artistic representations of the auto-da-fé usually depict torture and the burning at the stake. However, this type of activity never took place during an auto-da-fé, which was in essence a religious act. Torture was not administered after a trial concluded, and executions were always held after and separate from the auto-da-fé, though in the minds and experiences of observers and those undergoing the confession and execution, {{the separation of the}} two might be experienced <b>as</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> technicality.|$|E

25|$|In 1992, McDonnell Douglas {{unveiled}} {{a study of}} a double deck jumbo-sized aircraft designated MD-12. Despite briefly leaving the market, the study was perceived <b>as</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> public relations exercise to disguise the fact that MDC was struggling under intense pressure from Boeing and Airbus. It was clear to most in the industry that MDC had neither the resources nor the money to develop such a large aircraft, and the study quickly sank without a trace. A similar double deck concept was used in Boeing's later Ultra-Large Aircraft study intended to replace the 747, but ultimately the double deck concept would not {{see the light of}} day until the Airbus A380 in the 2000s.|$|E
25|$|Religions and {{religious}} movements which use magic, such as Wicca, Thelema, Neopaganism, occultism etc., often require their adherents to meditate as a preliminary to the magical work. This is because magic is often thought {{to require a}} particular state of mind {{in order to make}} contact with spirits, or because one has to visualize one's goal or otherwise keep intent focused for a long period during the ritual in order to see the desired outcome. Meditation practice in these religions usually revolves around visualization, absorbing energy from the universe or higher self, directing one's internal energy, and inducing various trance states. Meditation and magic practice often overlap in these religions as meditation is often seen <b>as</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> stepping stone to supernatural power, and the meditation sessions may be peppered with various chants and spells.|$|E
25|$|These {{first three}} (and {{subsequently}} more) Russian language imprints were published and circulated in the Russian Empire during the 1903–6 period {{as a tool}} for scapegoating Jews, blamed by the monarchists for the defeat in the Russo-Japanese War and the Revolution of 1905. Common to all three texts is the idea that Jews aim for world domination. Since The Protocols are presented <b>as</b> <b>merely</b> <b>a</b> document, the front matter and back matter are needed to explain its alleged origin. The diverse imprints, however, are mutually inconsistent. The general claim is that the document was stolen from a secret Jewish organization. Since the alleged original stolen manuscript does not exist, one is forced to restore a purported original edition. This has been done by the Italian scholar, Cesare G. De Michelis in 1998, in a work which was translated into English and published in 2004, where he treats his subject as Apocrypha.|$|E
