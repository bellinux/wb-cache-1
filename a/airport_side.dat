The exact location and rotation of the building seems to vary within this area; indeed, the CGI zoom shots of the building's exterior in the season-two episode, [...] "Montecito Lancers", shows the building in three slightly differing locations for three different shots. Also, a few interior and exterior shots were filmed in Dana Point, California, at the St. Regis Hotel in Monarch Beach.

50|$|The {{airport is}} {{situated}} on the Grand Southern Trunk Road (National Highway 32), a major national highway connecting several cities within the state. The airport is served by Tirusulam railway station on the Suburban railway network. Airport prepaid taxis are available round the clock, with moderate fares fixed by the government. The airport metro station of the Chennai Metro connects the airport {{to other parts of}} the city, making it the second airport in India to be connected to a metro system. Shuttle services between the metro station and the terminals are provided for the passengers. In future, the concourse of the metro station will be linked to the passenger terminals by means of a connector tube connecting the metro station to the flyover at the terminals, so that passengers alighting from the train can go to the departure area of the airport terminals without coming out of the station building. The Tirusulam suburban train station will also be integrated with the metro station and the airport. A flyover at the entrance of the airport helps the traffic on GST road bypass the entrance. The Kathipara grade-separator at Guindy facilitates the traffic flowing from the city centre onto the <b>airport</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E

The first act occurs in Barrio del Carmen, then another act to commemorate the Treaty of Loreto and the Treaty of Guadalupe on Hidalgo and Chihualcan Streets. After this, there is a large shared banquet with food provided by area residents to the mock soldiers. Then there is an inspection of the troops by one playing General Zaragoza, with a tradition of cutting the hair of a new member of the troops for “lice.” The last battle occurs in the evening with the French troops climbing on <b>airport</b> <b>side</b> and the Mexican troops on the Río Consulado side.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to show how the aircraft noise sources can be used as a tool for aircraft detection and for increasing flight safety.

The research has led to new findings, such as determining the aircraft model by measuring the noise level generated by an aircraft during final approach based on its frequency spectrum, as the connectivity from the <b>airport’s</b> <b>side</b> to the radar data was unavailable (only ATC). In addition, it is possible to determine the aircraft altitude and, perhaps most significantly, the increase of flight safety through the detection of potential failures on the aircraft structure and/or engine during the overflight of a noise monitoring terminal...|$|R
