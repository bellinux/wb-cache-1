5|$|Due to the episodic {{nature of}} the Axis attacks and the {{relatively}} small number of ships and submarines committed, Germany and Japan were not successful in disrupting Australian shipping.

5|$|Hippo {{defecation}} creates allochthonous {{deposits of}} organic matter along the river beds. These deposits have an unclear ecological function. A 2015 study suggests that hippo dung provides nutrients from terrestrial material for fish and aquatic invertebrates. Because of their size and their habit of taking the same paths to feed, hippos can have <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> land across which they walk, both by keeping the land clear of vegetation and depressing the ground. Over prolonged periods, hippos can divert the paths of swamps and channels.|$|E

The music journalist, Steve Lamacq broadcast on Q102, which later became XFM.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1808, the Portuguese {{were the}} only European people to settle Brazil in {{significant}} numbers. Although British, Germans, Italians and Spanish had previously immigrated to Brazil, they had only done so as {{a small number of}} individuals or in very small groups. These earliest non-Portuguese settlers did not have <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> culture of Portugal's Brazilian colony. The situation changed after 1808 when King JoãoVI began to encourage immigration from European countries outside Portugal.|$|E

Overall, Deep Blue Sea went on to make $73,648,142 in the United States and Canada, and $164,648,142 worldwide. The film's performance was compared to Stephen Sommers's The Mummy and Jan de Bont's The Haunting, which had a similar budget and made <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> box office {{in the summer of}} 1999.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} the route had <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{character}} {{and culture of the}} Sevier Valley. It has also been a motivating factor for environmentalists to create a new National Park along the path of the highway to protect scenic areas around the route. I-70 from Green River to Grand Junction, Colorado is part of the Dinosaur Diamond Prehistoric Highway, making I-70 one of the few Interstate Highways to be named a National Scenic Byway. Attractions listed by the Federal Highway Administration for the Dinosaur Diamond Prehistoric Highway on or near I-70 include, Arches National Park, Canyonlands National Park, Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, Goblin Valley State Park and Westwater. The designation lists several side roads branching from I-70 that lead to dinosaur bones or footprints.|$|E
5|$|The {{design and}} {{personality}} traits {{of the character}} Rei Ayanami were reused for many anime characters of the late 1990s, such as Ruri Hoshino of Nadesico, Ruriko Tsukushima (The Droplet), Miharu (Gasaraki), Anthy Himemiya (Revolutionary Girl Utena), and Lain Iwakura (Serial Experiments Lain). The character of Asuka was parodied by Excel (Excel Saga), {{and some of her}} traits were used to create the character of Mai in Gunparade March. According to Italian critic Guido Tavassi, Evangelions mecha design, characterized by a greater resemblance to the human figure, and the abstract designs of the Angels, also had <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> designs of future anime productions.|$|E

5|$|The small glaciers in {{the forest}} are less able to resist melting than the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Once a glacier begins retreating, it may fall into disequilibrium and be unable to find mass balance (accumulation versus melting rate) at any size. Without a {{favorable}} climate change, {{it will continue to}} retreat until it disappears. Loss of glacial ice already reduces the summer glacial runoff that supplies water to streams and lakes and provides a cold-water source vital to certain fish and plant species. This, in turn, may have <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forest ecosystem over time.|$|E

The continental Europe and Great Britain synchronous areas were estimated to have about 90 gigawatts of solar power and {{it was estimated that}} production would temporarily decrease by up to 34 GW compared to a clear sky day. The temperature may decrease by 3°C, and wind power potentially decreases as winds are reduced by 0.7m/s.|$|E

5|$|A report {{published}} by the city in 2007 declared the line a success and stated that all goals for the line had been exceeded. A {{survey conducted by the}} city in 2003 and 2007 showed that the Ring Line had <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> use of public transport in the area. Total public transport usage increased from 28 to 45%; use for commuting increased from 35 to 61%. At the Norwegian School of Management (BI), 85% of the students used public transport. The Ring Line reduced the estimated number of daily car trips by 10,000, and generated 11,000 more daily public transport trips. In 2007, daily passenger numbers at the stations were 8420 for Nydalen, 3630 for Storo and 2300 at Sinsen. The line allowed travel time from the Nydalen and Storo to the city centre to be halved, and travel time from Nydalen to the city center is faster by metro than by taxi.|$|E
5|$|A {{supernova}} is a cataclysmic {{explosion of}} a star. Within the Milky Way galaxy, supernova explosions occur on average once every 40 years. During {{the history of}} the Earth, multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with radioisotopes and possibly impact the biosphere. Gamma rays emitted by a supernova react with nitrogen in the atmosphere, producing nitrous oxides. These molecules cause a depletion of the ozone layer that protects the surface from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. An increase in UV-B radiation of only 10–30% is sufficient to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the phytoplankton that form the base of the oceanic food chain. A supernova explosion at a distance of 26light years will reduce the ozone column density by half. On average, a supernova explosion occurs within 32light years once every few hundred million years, resulting in a depletion of the ozone layer lasting several centuries. Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one gamma ray burst that will have <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> planet's biosphere.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Aliya Rama Raya in the Battle of Talikota, Tirumala Deva Raya started the Aravidu dynasty, moved and founded a new capital of Penukonda to replace the {{destroyed}} Hampi, and attempted to reconstitute the remains of Vijayanagara Empire. Tirumala abdicated in 1572, dividing the remains of his kingdom to his three sons, and pursued a religious life {{until his death in}} 1578. The Aravidu dynasty successors ruled the region but the empire collapsed in 1614, and the final remains ended in 1646, from continued wars with the Bijapur sultanate and others. During this period, more kingdoms in South India became independent and separate from Vijayanagara. These include the Mysore Kingdom, Keladi Nayaka, Nayaks of Madurai, Nayaks of Tanjore, Nayakas of Chitradurga and Nayak Kingdom of Gingee– all of which declared independence and went on to have <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> history of South India in the coming centuries.|$|E
