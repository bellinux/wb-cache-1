40|$|Abstract — One of {{the primary}} impediments to {{building}} ensembles of modular robots is the complexity and number of mechanical mechanisms used to construct the individual modules. As part of the Claytronics project—which aims to build very large ensembles of modular robots—we investigate how to simplify each module by eliminating moving parts and {{reducing the number of}} mechanical mechanisms on each robot by using force-at-a-distance actuators. Additionally, we are also investigating the feasibility of using these unary actuators to improve docking performance, implement intermodule <b>adhesion,</b> <b>power</b> transfer, communication, and sensing. In this paper we describe our most recent results in the magnetic domain, including our first design sufficiently robust to operate reliably in groups greater than two modules. Our work should be seen as an extension of systems such as Fracta [9], and a contrasting line of inquiry to several other researchers ’ prior efforts that have used magnetic latching to attach modules to one another but relied upon a powered hinge [10] or telescoping mechanism [12] within each module to facilitate self-reconfiguration.

Basil leaves are air-dried, then distilled by water and steam distillation for ± 6 hours.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{microbial}} {{fuel cells}} (MFCs), the oxidation of organic compounds catalyzed by microorganisms (anode) generates electricity via electron transfer to an external circuit {{that acts as}} an electron acceptor (cathode). Microbial fuel cells differ {{in terms of the}} microorganisms employed {{and the nature of the}} oxidized organic compound. In this study, a consortium of anaerobic microorganisms helped to treat the secondary sludge obtained from a sewage treatment plant. The microorganisms were grown in a 250 mL bioreactor containing a carbon cloth. The reactor was fed with media containing acetate (as the carbon source) for 48 days. Concomitantly, the electrochemical data were measured with the aid of a digital multimeter and data acquisition system. At the beginning of the MFC operation, power density was low, probably due to slow microorganism growth and <b>adhesion.</b> The <b>power</b> density increased from the 15 th day of operation, reaching a value of 13. 5 &# 956;W cm&# 8211; 2 after ca. 24 days of operation, and remained stable until the end of the process. Compared with data in the literature, this power density value is promising; improvements in the MFC design and operation could increase this value even further. The system investigated herein employed excess sludge as a biocatalyst in an MFC. This opens up the possibility of using organic acids and/or carbohydrate-rich effluents to feed MFCs, and thereby provide simultaneous effluent treatment and energy generation...|$|R

Although {{this has been}} recognized for some time, there is no basis for quantitative characterization of this complex process. Here we describe a recently developed assay designed to quantify aspects {{of the process and}} discuss its application in comparing behaviors between cell types. Cells were seeded in nonadhesive micromolded wells, each well with a circular trough at its base formed by the cylindrical sidewalls and by a central peg {{in the form of a}} right circular cone. Cells settled into the trough and coalesced into a toroid, which was then driven up the conical peg by the forces of self-assembly. The mass of the toroid and its rate of upward movement were used to calculate the cell power expended in the process against gravity. The power of the toroid was found to be 0. 31 ± 0. 01 pJ/h and 4. 3 ± 1. 7 pJ/h for hepatocyte cells and fibroblasts, respectively. Blocking Rho kinase by means of Y- 27632 resulted in a 50 % and greater reduction in power expended by each type of toroid, indicating that cytoskeletal-mediated contraction plays a significant role in the self-assembly of both cell types. Whereas the driving force for self-assembly has often been viewed as the binding of surface proteins, these data show that cellular contraction is important for cell–cell <b>adhesion.</b> The <b>power</b> measurement quantifies the contribution of cell contraction, and will be useful for understanding the concerted action of the mechanisms that drive self-assembly...|$|R
5000|$|Most PSAs {{are best}} suited {{to be used in}} {{moderate}} temperatures of around 59-95 °F. Within this temperature range typical adhesives maintain their balance in viscous and elastic behavior where optimal surface wetting can be achieved. At extremely high temperatures the tape may be able to stretch more than it could initially. This could cause problems after application to the surface because if the temperature drops the tape may experience additional stress. This may lead to the tape losing some of its contact area, lowering its shear <b>adhesion</b> or holding <b>power.</b> At lower temperatures the adhesive polymers become harder and stiffer which lowers the overall elasticity of the tape and begins to react like glass. [...] The lower elasticity makes it harder for the adhesives to be in contact with the surface and lowers its wet-ability. An adhesive can be formulated to maintain tack in cooler temperatures or a greater amount of adhesive coating on the tape may be necessary. The backing of the adhesives may also be plasticized in order to lower its glass transition temperature and retain its flexibility.|$|R

Tomato is used in the form of tomato juice made by extraction method. Tomato in their use directly is less effective so that tomato is made in the form of cream.

If the growth species are ionized this can be achieved by the use of a substrate bias or a magnetic field. Ions may be accelerated by an applied potential, whereas neutral particles may not. Thin films grown by ionized physical vapor deposition (I-PVD) have lately shown promising results regarding film structure and <b>adhesion.</b> High <b>power</b> impulse magnetron sputtering (HIPIMS) is a relatively newly developed technique, which relies on the creation of a dense plasma in front of the sputtering target to produce a large fraction of ions of the sputtered material. In HIPIMS, high power pulses with a length of ~ 100 μs are applied to a conventional planar magnetron. The highly energetic nature of the discharge, which involves power densities of several kW/cm 2, creates a dense plasma in front of the target, which allows for a large fraction of the sputtered material to be ionized. The work presented in this thesis involves plasma analysis using electrostatic probes, optical emission spectroscopy (OES), magnetic probes, energy resolved mass spectrometry, and other fundamental observation techniques. These techniques used together are powerful plasma analysis tools, and used together give a good overview of the plasma properties is achieved. from the erosion zone of the magnetron. The peak plasma density during the active cycle of the discharge exceeds 1019 electrons/m 3. The expanding plasma is reflected by the chamber wall back into the center part of the chamber, resulting in a second density peak several hundreds of μs after the pulse is turned off. Optical emission spectroscopy (OES) measurements of the plasma indicate that the degree of ionization of sputtered Ti is very high, over 90 % in the peak of the pulse. Even at relatively low applied target power (~ 200 W/cm 2 peak power) the recorded spectrum is totally dominated by radiation from ions. The recorded HIPIMS spectra were compared to a spectrum taken from a DC magnetron discharge, showing a completely different appearance. Magnetic field measurements performed with a coil type probe show significant deformation in the magnetic field of the magnetrons during the pulse. Spatially resolved measurements show evidence of a dense azimuthally E×B drifting current. Circulating currents mainly flow within 2 away cm from the target surface in an early part of the pulse, to later diffuse axially into the chamber and decrease in intensity. We record peak current densities of the E×B drift to be of the order of 105 A/m 2. A mass spectrometry (MS) study of the plasma reveals that the HIPIMS discharge contains a larger fraction of highly energetic ions as compared to the continuous DC discharge. Especially ions of the target material are more energetic. Time resolved studies show broad distributions of ion energies in the early stage of the discharge, which quickly narrows down after pulse switch-off. Ti ions with energies up to 100 eV are detected. The time average plasma contains mainly low energy Ar ions, but during the active phase of the discharge, the plasma is highly metallic. Shortly after pulse switch-on, the peak value of the Ti 1 +/Ar 1 + ratio is over 2. The HIPIMS discharge also contains a significant amount of doubly charged ions...|$|R
