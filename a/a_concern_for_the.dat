5|$|In 1998, the {{historic}} {{status of the}} barges was <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Port Authority of Bridgeport Harbor, as the sunken ships interfered with a billion-dollar redevelopment project. Over the years, the barges had deteriorated so that a salvage operation would likely result in them breaking apart. No action had been taken by 2003, but a report noted that prior to any activity of the Berkshire No. 7, the Federal Transit Administration and/or the City of Bridgeport should document the barge with photos and a technical description. Specifics regarding the documentation based on the activity would be archived at the State Historic Preservation Office and the Mystic Seaport Museum.|$|E
5|$|With {{forest fires}} {{continuing}} to burn in neighboring Indonesia, heavy smog was <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> event. Unhealthy levels forced {{the cancellation of}} other events in Singapore in the week {{leading up to the}} Grand Prix. Race organisers, however, did not speculate whether the Grand Prix was also under threat of cancellation. It was later reported that the smog had lifted and that the race could go ahead without any restrictions.|$|E
5|$|For another episode for {{the series}} filmed in New York City he {{was asked by the}} NYPD not to pre-announce the performance, as crowd control for some Angel {{performances}} had become <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> police. This trick saw Angel hanging his feet, while bound with two straitjackets and a noose around his neck which were attached to metal weights. While he was successful in the trick, Angel tore his shoulder muscles and this required surgery in January 2014. This resulted in the temporary closing of the Believe stage show between January and April 2014, while he was recovering from the surgery and returning to performance shape. He did however host a new stage show featuring other magicians between February and March 2014 in lieu of performing in his own show. Clips from the show also became the most watched YouTube magic clips {{in the history of the}} site, with more than 15 million views.|$|E

5|$|Chicago's {{top four}} {{receiver}}s, Alshon Jeffery, Eddie Royal, Marquess Wilson and Kevin White, were not active {{for the game}} in Cincinnati. During the game, Perry, Clausen, cornerback Tracy Porter, wide receiver John Chiles and linebacker Jon Bostic also suffered injuries. Penalties were <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Bears, who committed 12 for 117 yards; the offense also struggled on converting third downs, with only two of eleven successful. On defense, the Bears allowed the Bengals to score three unanswered touchdowns: {{in the first quarter}} with Andy Dalton's one-yard run, and in the second with AJ McCarron's touchdown pass to Marvin Jones and Jeremy Hill's one-yard run. It would not be until the final six seconds of the half that the Bears scored, with Gould's 34-yard field goal. The first-team offense left the game during the third quarter, with all but one drive having ended in a punt, and on four of those drives, the unit failed to record a first down. Halfway through the final quarter, the Bears were able to make the score 21–10 after Ify Umodu blocked Kevin Huber's punt and returned it for an eight-yard touchdown.|$|E

25|$|The Texas Towers were a set {{of three}} radar {{facilities}} off the eastern seaboard of the United States which were used for surveillance by the United States Air Force during the Cold War.

25|$|The current known {{populations of}} G. kennedyana {{appear to be}} quite stable {{for the last six}} years that it has been {{monitored}} in the field. At present there is no known evidence to suggest that the species is significantly declining or being threatened. Also because of the species ability to persist given the heavy grazing that occurred in the park, the wild populations of the plant looks likely to remain for at least another 50–100 years. The lack of recruitment is <b>a</b> <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> survival of the plant in the long-term. A possible reason for its rarity is most likely the result of natural evolutionary and ecological processes.|$|E

40|$|Against the {{background}} of the debate over the constitutionality of state-sponsored higher education affirmative action programs, this Essay presents an account of the modern equal protection framework that balances <b>a</b> normative <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> protection of individuals from discrimination and <b>a</b> structural <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> counter-majoritarian difficulty. The author suggests that state-sponsored higher education affirmative action programs may survive strict scrutiny, and that proposals urging the judicial consideration of public opinion about such programs should be rejected. Even if public opinion could be accurately gauged, it should not influence the application of strict scrutiny to such programs, or play any part in equal protection review...|$|R

In Nepal, the governance has struggled to come in the side of democracy and it only showed signs in the recent past, basically in the 21st century, to support the democratic system. The political situation in Sri Lanka has been dominated by an increasingly assertive Sinhalese nationalism, and the emergence of a Tamil separatist movement under LTTE, which was suppressed in May 2009. Myanmar's politics is dominated by a military Junta, which has sidelined the democratic forces led by Aung San Suu Kyi.|$|E

Public and Authorities were unhappy because the Sons Of Freedom did not register their births, deaths or marriages that occurred within their communities; in addition to the fact that they weren't sending their children to public schools. Public alarm was increasing, based on the fears that the unruly incidents of nude protests, burning of homes and buildings and bombings of bridges and railways, were not being attended to by the RCMP.|$|E

The Reserve Bank of Australia places the most weight on minimizing the deviation of output from trend. Joint tests of the posterior distributions of these policy preference parameters suggest that the central banks are very similar in their overall objective. ...|$|R
