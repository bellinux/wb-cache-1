Powders measured were Kanto loam, fused alumina, glass beads, ground feldspar and ground quartz. As a result, {{it was found that}} the average sizes obtained by the methods measuring a number of particles (optical microscopy, Coulter counter and light scattering) were greater than those by the methods based on settling particles in the liquid phase (<b>Andreasen</b> <b>pipette,</b> sedimentation balance and photo extinction). For powders with size range of 1 - 15 μm, the methods of <b>Andreasen</b> <b>pipette</b> and sedimentation balance were more available with respect to the reliability...|$|E

40|$|The {{need to know}} precise {{particle}} size distributions {{for a variety of}} applications has {{led to the development of}} new particle sizing techniques. A particularly useful technique is that of forward light scattering utilised by the Malvern Laser Particle Sizer. This new technique has been used to measure the {{particle size}} distributions of three powders, (silica, latex and minusil) and the results compared with size distributions determined by the more traditional techniques (Coulter counter, Warman cyclosizer and <b>Andreasen</b> <b>pipette).</b> The new instrument showed good agreement with existing techniques for those samples in which the particles were spherical...|$|E
40|$|The {{sorption}} {{behavior of}} Ba 2 +, Co 2 + and Zn 2 + ions on alumina, kaolinite and magnesite {{have been investigated}} using the batch method. 60 Co, 65 Zn and 133 Ba were used as radiotracers. The mineral samples were separated into different particle size fractions using an <b>Andreasen</b> <b>Pipette.</b> The particle sizes used in the sorption experiments were all less than 38 μm. Synthetic groundwaters were used which had compositions similar to those from the regions where the minerals were recovered. The samples were shaken with a lateral shaker at 190 rpm, the phases were separated by centrifuging and adioactivity counted using a NaI(Tl) detector. Kinetic studies indicated that sorption onto the minerals took place in two stages with the slower process dominating. The highest sorption was observed on alumina. Both Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich type isotherms were found to describe the sorption process well. The distribution ratio, Rd {{was found to be}} a function of the liquid volume to solid mass ratio. The Rd's for sorption on binary mixtures of minerals were experimentally determined and compared with those predicted from Rd values of each individual mineral. © 1994 Akadémiai Kiadó...|$|E
40|$|The {{particle}} size distribution and mean {{particle size}} {{are the most important}} characteristics in particulate or powder technology. Various approaches have been used to measure {{particle size distribution}}s. For solid-liquid systems, the particle size distributions have been measured by the Stokes diameter. The <b>Andreasen</b> <b>pipette</b> method, sedimentation balance method, centrifugal sedimentation method, etc. have been used to measure the particle size distribution in suspensions. These methods measure the migration velocities of particles in solution, and then particle size is calculated using Stokes formula. However, all these methods are time consuming and require special skills. On the other hand, a different principle can be used to analyze the particle size distribution through microscopy, laser diffraction/scattering method, and a Coulter counter method. These methods require numerous samples to accurately determine the particle size distribution. Although the laser diffraction/scattering and Coulter counter methods produce highly accurate results within a shorter time, they require extremely expensive equipment. Hence, a simple and cost effective method to determine the particle size distribution is highly demanded. The investigation of particle size distributions by the buoyancy weighing-bar method which is a novel method in particle size distribution measurement have been done for several samples particles of Japan Industrial Standard (Test Powders 1 and Test Powders 2), Sumitomo 3 M (glass beads K 1, K 37, S 60 HS), polystyrene beads (spherical), nylon beads (cylindrical), etc. The influence of solid concentration, influence of shape and size of weighing bar and influence of vessel size also had been investigated in particle size distribution measurement by the buoyancy weighing-bar method. The result data obtained by the buoyancy weighing-bar method were comparable with the others particle size analyzer, such as sedimentation balance method, <b>Andreasen</b> <b>pipette</b> method, Coulter counter method, microscopy and the laser diffraction/scattering method. The buoyancy weighing-bar method is suitable for measuring the settling particle size distribution and the floating particle size distribution. The buoyancy weighing-bar method could be used to measure the particle size distribution in Stokes region and in Allen region. The particle size distribution obtained by the buoyancy weighing-bar method could be used to estimate the smaller particle size by using the Rosin-Rammler distribution. Theory was rediscussed and the new mean particle size was defined. Beside, the buoyancy weighing-bar method could be used to determine the mean particle sizes for a ternary mixture and multi-component particles in a short time. This ability is very useful in the powder industry. Similar to other methods to analyze particle size, the buoyancy weighing-bar method is accurate in an initially homogeneous suspension. Because the buoyancy weighing-bar method apparatus can be made by hand, it is also economical. Additionally, the buoyancy weighing-bar method is easier to be implemented compared to other sedimentation particle analysis methods. 室蘭工業大学 (Muroran Institute of Technology) 博士（工学...|$|E

Characterization was done using SEM-EDX, XRF, ATR-FTIR, XRD, and DT/DTG; <b>Andreasen</b> <b>pipette</b> sedimentation technique was used to determine the grain size distribution of the raw kaolinite. The X-ray diffraction pattern revealed the existence of an FCC Bravais lattice where the intercalation ratios attained were 51. 2 %, 32. 4 %, 7. 0 %, and 38. 4 % for hydroxyaluminum oligomeric intercalated kaolinite, substituted urea intercalated kaolinite, calcined DMSO intercalated kaolinite, and hydroxyaluminum reintercalated kaolinite, respectively, along with their respective crystallite sizes of 33. 51 – 31. 73 [*]nm, 41. 92 – 39. 69 [*]nm, 22. 31 – 21. 13 [*]nm, and 41. 86 – 39. 63 [*]nm. The outcomes demonstrated that the employed intercalation routes require improvements as the intercalation reactions were in average only ≈ 32. 3 %. The observations unveiled {{that it is possible to}} manipulate kaolinite structure into various morphologies including dense-tightly packed overlapping euhedral pseudo hexagonal platelets, stacked vermiform morphologies, postulated forms, and unique patterns exhibiting self-assembled curled glomeruli-like morphologies. Such a diversity of kaolinite morphologies expedites its advanced applications in the controlled release systems (CRS) such as drug delivery systems and controlled release fertilizers (CRFs) ...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{important}} characteristics of cement quality is particle size distribution. There are several simple methods to measure the particle size distribution of cement based on the Stokes diameter, like <b>Andreasen</b> <b>pipette</b> method, sedimentation balance method, centrifugal sedimentation method, etc. A major disadvantages of these methods are they are time consuming process and require special skills. Particle size distribution also can be analyzed by using a different principle through microscopy, laser diffraction/scattering methods and Coulter counter method. Even these methods produce highly accurate results within a shorter time, however, the equipments are expensive. In the present study, it has developed a new method to overcome the problem. The method is the buoyancy weighing-bar method. This method is a simple and cost-effective. The principle of the buoyancy weighing-bar method that the density change in a suspension due to particle migration is measured by weighing buoyancy against a weighing– bar hung in the suspension, and the particle size distribution is calculated using {{the length of the}} weighing-bar and the time–course change in the the apparent mass of the weighing–bar. This apparatus consists of an analytical balance with a hook for underfloor weighing, and a weighing–bar, which is used to detect the density change in suspension. The result obtained show that the buoyancy weighing–bar method is suitable for measuring the particle size distribution of cement, and the result is comparable to that of determined by settling balance method...|$|E
