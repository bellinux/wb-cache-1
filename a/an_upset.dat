40|$|A growing {{literature}} {{shows that}} even the symbolic presence of an attachment figure facilitates the regulation of negative affect triggered by external stressors. Yet, in daily life, pernicious stressors are often internally generated—recalling <b>an</b> <b>upsetting</b> experience reliably increases negative affect, rumination, and susceptibility to physical and psychological health problems. The present research provides the first systematic examination of whether activating the mental representation of an attachment figure enhances the regulation of affect triggered by thinking about upsetting memories. Using 2 different techniques for priming attachment figure representations and 2 types of negative affect measures (explicit and implicit), activating the mental representation of an attachment figure (vs. an acquaintance or stranger) after recalling <b>an</b> <b>upsetting</b> memory enhanced recovery—eliminating {{the negative effects of}} the memory recall (Studies 1 – 3). In contrast, activating the mental representation of an attachment figure before recalling <b>an</b> <b>upsetting</b> memory had no such effect (Studies 1 and 2). Furthermore, activating the mental representation of an attachment figure after thinking about upsetting memories reduced negative thinking in a stream of consciousness task, and the magnitude of the attachment-induced affective recovery effects as assessed with explicit affect measures predicted mental and physical healt...|$|R

40|$|Nanometric CMOS {{is likely}} to {{experience}} the occurrence of a single event causing <b>a</b> multiple-node <b>upset.</b> This paper presents a novel memory cell design as variant of the DICE cell (that is tolerant to only a single event with <b>a</b> single-node <b>upset).</b> The proposed design {{is referred to as}} TDICE and uses transistors to block the paths that connect a node to the next node in the feed- back loop of the memory cell circuit. The use of these transistors hardens the cell to tolerate a single event with <b>a</b> multiple-node <b>upset</b> at <b>a</b> large value of critical charge. Extensive simulation results are provided to assess TDICE with respect to traditional circuit figures of merit such as area, power consumption, and delay as well as PVT variations. The simulation results show that, at the expense of an increased area for the additional transistors, TDICE shows a nearly complete tolerance to a single event with <b>a</b> multiple-node <b>upset...</b>|$|R
