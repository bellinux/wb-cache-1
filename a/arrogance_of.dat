5|$|After John succeeded Richard in 1199, {{he decided}} to restore Geoffrey to the archiepiscopal estates, but {{continued}} to receive the income until the archbishop returned from Rome. Some of Geoffrey's opponents who were officials in his diocese resigned their offices, and {{for a short time}} peace reigned in York. But the perceived <b>arrogance</b> <b>of</b> Geoffrey's officials offended the cathedral chapter at York, and this further conflict was not resolved until March 1200. For most of the remainder of 1199 Geoffrey was frequently with the king, and the two appear to have been on good terms, a state of affairs that continued throughout the first half of 1200.|$|E
5|$|Ancient lore {{states that}} Vana'diel was {{created as a}} {{playground}} for the Gods and their children, who themselves were spawned from an enormous and sentient Crystal. Eventually wishing to be one with the Gods, the children constructed a pathway to paradise. They were smote down for their insolence, however, and their cities cast {{to the bottom of}} the sea. After seeing the destruction of her children and filled with sadness, the Goddess Altana wept five tears that gave life to the five Enlightened Races of Vana'diel. The God of Twilight, Promathia, condemned her weakness, however, and the life that arose from it. Promathia cursed the five races with eternal conflict amongst themselves by bringing forth their darkest attributes: the apathy of the Humes, the <b>arrogance</b> <b>of</b> the Elvaan, the rage of the Galka, the cowardice of the Tarutaru, and the envy of the Mithra. He created the Beastmen, commanding them to forever fight the people of Vana'diel and occupy their minds, so these children would never have time to group together and construct a pathway like the ones before them. The creation lore's sentient Crystal, Gods, Children, and the truths behind them feature as major plot points in several Final Fantasy XI expansion packs, while the Beastmen are some of the game's main antagonists.|$|E

25|$|Fabbrini in 2011 {{identified}} a cycle in anti-Americanism in Europe: modest in the 1990s, it grew explosively between 2003–2008, then declined after 2008.

Following a draw in Cardiff and victory at home to Northern Ireland, Scotland travelled to Wembley needing to beat England, who had won both their matches, to take the title. This was secured with a 3–2 win which has become legendary in Scottish football, not only because it was England's first defeat since becoming world champions the previous year, but due to Scotland's assured performance and the skillful <b>arrogance</b> <b>of</b> Jim Baxter, who at various times juggled the ball by himself.|$|E
25|$|Admirers {{praise the}} force of Trudeau's intellect and salute his {{political}} acumen in preserving national unity against the Quebec sovereignty movement, suppressing a terrorist crisis, fostering a pan-Canadian identity, and in achieving sweeping institutional reform, including the implementation of official bilingualism, patriation of the Constitution, {{and the establishment of}} the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Critics accuse him of <b>arrogance,</b> <b>of</b> economic mismanagement, and of unduly centralizing Canadian decision-making to the detriment of Quebec's culture and the economy of the Prairies.

However, as the Qutb Shah was making plans to invade Madras the {{invasion}} of the Marathas consumed his attention. Madras was spared from an invasion but restrictions were imposed on trade with the colony.

25|$|Some of {{the major}} themes {{explored}} in Wendy Rose’s works are themes relating to the Native American experience (both specifically her own and also more broadly applied to other cultures of marginalization): colonialism, imperialism, dependency, nostalgia for the old ways, reverence for grandparents, resentment for conditions of the present, plight of reservation and urban Indians, sense of hopelessness, {{the power of the}} trickster, feminism as synonymous with heritage, deadly compromise, symbolism of all that has been lost (such as land), tension between the desire to retrieve the past and the inevitability of change, <b>arrogance</b> <b>of</b> white people, problems of half-breeds (or mixed-bloods).|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{officers}} enlisted from the merchant Navy felt insulted by the perceived <b>arrogance</b> <b>of</b> their comrades, and were suspicious {{as to the}} sincerity of their allegiance to the Republic. Captain Coëtnempren would be arrested and eventually sent to the guillotine upon a denunciation by a junior officer who accused him from withholding his advancement {{because he was a}} commoner from the merchant navy. Due to the desertions of high-ranking officers of noble extraction or Royalist convictions, these merchant officers were promoted very quickly to fill the ranks; this both transformed the social composition of naval staff, and promoted officers of little experience to command positions.|$|E
25|$|The strike lasted 172 days, at {{the time}} making it ({{at the time}}) the longest in UAW history and the longest strike in International Harvester history. International Harvester made key errors—including using inexperienced negotiators, going public with {{bargaining}} demands, and attacking key union issues such as seniority {{and the lack of}} mandatory overtime without giving itself room to negotiate—which greatly prolonged the strike. The seeming <b>arrogance</b> <b>of</b> top company officials is {{considered by many to be}} a serious strategic error.

40|$|ARROGANCE IN BUSINESS: A BIBLICAL PERSPECTIVE Arrogance is an {{attribute}} that influences many businesses {{and the people}} working in these businesses. It {{can lead to a}} plethora of problems in businesses in which it is being practiced. Despite this, arrogance appears to be occurring in many organizations. The Bible in both the Old and New Testaments warns of the dangers <b>of</b> <b>arrogance</b> and arrogant behavior. This paper will examine examples <b>of</b> how <b>arrogance</b> is practiced and negatively affects a number of different businesses and different functional areas within business. It then examines Biblical references and principles concerning arrogance. Recommendations are made to help business practitioners avoid arrogance in their business decision making and create business cultures where arrogance is not practiced. <b>ARROGANCE</b> Specific definitions <b>of</b> <b>arrogance</b> are difficult to find in the social sciences literature. When mentioned in the literature references to other concepts such as pride and hubris are also noted. Bible commentaries and concordances also make references to pride when relating to this concept. The only specific definition found <b>of</b> <b>arrogance</b> says it is “feeling or an impression o...|$|R

25|$|In 2004, Sergio Fabbrini {{wrote that}} the {{perceived}} post-9/11 unilateralism of the 2003 invasion of Iraq fed deep rooted anti-American feeling in Europe, bringing it to the surface. In his article, he highlighted European fears surrounding the Americanization of the economy, culture and political process of Europe. Fabbrini in 2011 identified a cycle in anti-Americanism: modest in the 1990s, it grew explosively between 2003 and 2008, then declined after 2008. He sees the current version as related to images of American foreign policy-making as unrestrained by international institutions or world opinion.

25|$|In Vienna, Eugene's {{attitude}} was dismissed as the <b>arrogance</b> <b>of</b> a young upstart, but so impressed was the Emperor by {{his passion for}} the Imperial cause, he promoted him to Field-Marshal in 1693. When Caraffa's replacement, Count Caprara, was himself transferred in 1694, it seemed that Eugene's chance for command and decisive action had finally arrived. But Amadeus, doubtful of victory and now more fearful of Habsburg influence in Italy than he was of French, had begun secret dealings with Louis XIV aimed at extricating himself from the war. By 1696, the deal was done, and Amadeus transferred his troops and his loyalty to the enemy. Eugene was never to fully trust his cousin again; although he continued to pay due reverence to the Duke as head of his family, their relationship would forever after remain strained.|$|E
25|$|The Barid Shahi, {{surrounded}} by more powerful states, had invited {{the intervention of}} Vijayanagara {{in the affairs of}} the Muslim kingdoms. The <b>arrogance</b> <b>of</b> Sadasiva Raya had embarrased and disgusted both his enemies as well as allies, in addition the excesses of his troops had horrified the Muslims. He demanded cessation of extenstive territory from Bijapur for his assistance to Ali as well as from Golconda as punishment for duplicitous actions of Ibrahim. It seemed apparent to them that the end of Muslim rule was at hand if his ambition was not curbed. The Hindu army was defeated at the Battle of Talikota and fled with their loss estimated at 100,000 men. The city was hastily abandoned after its defeat. Both Muslims and Hindus plundered and burnt the Vijayanagara city. The victors occupied the city for six months and had it destroyed while plundering the country.|$|E

25|$|Abbots used to {{be subject}} to episcopal jurisdiction, and {{continued}} generally so, in fact, in the West till the 11th century. The Code of Justinian (lib. i. tit. iii. de Ep. leg. xl.) expressly subordinates the abbot to episcopal oversight. The first case recorded of the partial exemption of an abbot from episcopal control is that of Faustus, abbot of Lerins, at the council of Arles, AD 456; but the exorbitant claims and exactions of bishops, to which this repugnance to episcopal control is to be traced, far more than to the <b>arrogance</b> <b>of</b> abbots, rendered it increasingly frequent, and, in the 6th century, the practice of exempting religious houses partly or altogether from episcopal control, and making them responsible to the pope alone, received an impulse from Pope Gregory the Great. These exceptions, introduced with a good object, had grown into a widespread evil by the 12th century, virtually creating an imperium in imperio, and depriving the bishop of all authority over the chief centres of influence in his diocese.|$|E
25|$|On April 22 Rodezno was {{nominated}} to Secretariado Político {{of the new}} party, Falange Española Tradicionalista, one of 4 Carlists within the 10-member body. He and other Carlists learned of the party program only once its 21 points were announced and immediately demonstrated some unease. His relations with Fal and Don Javier remained extremely tense, though falling short of total breakup; both considered him a fronding rebel. Rodezno’s efforts to elicit authorization from the regent produced no effect. During {{the next few months}} he presided over absorption into Falange rather than a fusion, bombarded with queries and protests from Carlist rank-and-file about total predomination and <b>arrogance</b> <b>of</b> camisas azules. Possibly as a result of complaints about the Falangists’ lack of give and take in October 1937 Franco called up theoretically governing structure of the party, the National Council; within its ranks the Carlists were even worse-off, only 11 of them among its 50 members. Despite Fal’s calls to decline, Rodezno accepted the seat and in December 1937 Don Javier expulsed him from Carlism.|$|E
25|$|It was the {{tendency}} of the philosophy of Cousin to outline things and to fill up the details in an artistic and imaginative interest. He was observational and generalizing rather than analytic and discriminating. His search into principles was not profound, and his power of rigorous consecutive development was limited. He left no distinctive permanent principle of philosophy, but he left very interesting psychological analyses, and several new, just, and true expositions of philosophical systems, especially that of Locke and the philosophers of Scotland. He was {{at the same time}} a man of impressive power, of rare and wide culture, and of lofty aim,--far above priestly conception and Philistine narrowness. He was familiar with the broad lines of most systems of philosophy. His eclecticism was proof of a reverential sympathy with the struggles of human thought to attain to certainty in the highest problems of speculation. It was a doctrine of comprehension and toleration, forming a marked and valuable contrast to the <b>arrogance</b> <b>of</b> absolutism, to the dogmatism of sensationalism, and to the doctrine of church authority, preached by the theological school of his day. His spirit saved the youth of France from these other influences. As an educational reformer and a man of learning, who greatly influenced others, Cousin stands out among the memorable Frenchmen of the 19th century.|$|E
