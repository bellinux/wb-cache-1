40|$|A recent {{revision}} to the European Medical Device Directive (MDD 2007 / 47 /EC) made fourteen {{amendments to}} the original directive (93 / 42 /EEC). A number of these changes directly affect the development of software for use in healthcare. The most significant change in relation to medical device software development is that standalone software {{is now seen as}} an <b>active</b> <b>medical</b> <b>device.</b> Prior to this amendment medical device software was developed in accordance with the IEC 62304 standard.

40|$|The {{viability}} of siloxane-based thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) nanocomposites {{as a new}} insulation material for implantable and electrically <b>active</b> <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> is investigated. We show that manipulating and controlling the specific interactions between the TPU segments and the engineered nanofiller greatly varies the TPU properties. The incorporation of dual modified organofluoromica as the nanofiller successfully enhanced the tensile strength, toughness and tear strength of the TPU. This {{is due to the}} presence of dual surfactants, which form regions of higher and lower surface energy on the layered silicate surface, thus enabling molecular interactions between the organofluoromica and both the hard and the soft TPU segment populations. We show that the addition of a second choline-based modifier with reactive –OH functionality may lead to the formation of positively charged TPU chain end groups as a result of trans-urethanization reactions during high temperature compounding, thus introducing labile ‘‘grip-slip-grip-slip’’ interactions between the TPU and the nanofiller. These molecular interactions assist in achieving a reduced level of stiffening, {{while at the same time}} enhance the toughening mechanism. The increase in the creep resistance and retardation in the stress relaxation of the TPU provides evidence that the dual modified organofluoromica also serves to enhance the dimensional stability of the TPU...|$|R

A parameter laboratory instrument was designed at the University of Minho based on an innovative method of acessing friction coefficient of 2 D surfaces (fabrics, nonwovens, soft papers).

Additionally, ISO 9001:2008 sets precedence because it signifies that a company engages in the creation of new products. It requires that the development of manufactured products have an approval process and a set of rigorous quality standards and development records before the product is distributed. Further standards are IEC 60601-1 which is for electrical devices (mains-powered as well as battery powered), EN 45502-1 which is for <b>Active</b> implantable <b>medical</b> <b>devices,</b> and IEC 62304 for medical software. The US FDA also published a series of guidances for industry regarding this topic against 21 CFR 820 Subchapter H—Medical Devices. Subpart B includes quality system requirements, an important component of which are design controls (21 CFR 820.30).

High linear energy transfer (LET) radiation as, for example, C 12 heavy-ion beam therapy theoretically offers biological advantages compared to high energy x-ray therapy as, for example, higher biological efficiency. Methods/Design: In the present prospective, single-armed, open pilot study performed at the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center (HIT) in Heidelberg, the radiation treatment within the standard trimodal concept will be exchanged against C 12 heavy-ion beam treatment and apply 39 GyE in 13 single fractions in combination with a chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and vinorelbine (local standard). The primary endpoint is feasibility and safety measured by the incidence of NCI-CTCAE grade 3 / 4 toxicity and/or discontinuation due to any reason. Secondary endpoint is the degree of regression in the histological specimen. The main inclusion criteria are histologically confirmed non-small-cell superior sulcus tumor, nodal disease stage ≤ N 2, Karnofsky performance score ≥ 70 %, patient age between 18 and 75 years as well as written informed consent. The main exclusion criteria include medical contraindications against elements of the trimodal treatment concept, PET confirmed nodal disease stage N 3, stage IV disease, prior thoracic irradiation and decompensated diseases of the lung, cardio-vascular system, metabolism, hematopoietic and coagulation system and renal function.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a novel simulator to perform electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) tests for <b>active</b> implantable <b>medical</b> <b>devices</b> (AIMDs) with electromagnetic fields emitted by security systems. The security system simulator {{was developed in}} response to over 100 incident reports over 17 years related to the interference of AIMD’s with security systems {{and the lack of}} a standardized test method. The simulator was evaluated regarding field homogeneity, signal distortion, and maximum magnetic field strength levels. Small three-axis probes and a three-axis scanning system were designed to determine the spatial and temporal characteristics of the fields emitted by 12 different types of walk through metal detectors (WTMDs). Tests were performed on four implanted pacemakers with a saline phantom and correlated to a newly developed test method performed “in air ” (without the phantom). Comparison of the simulator thresholds with tests per-formed in real WTMDs showed that the simulator is able to mimic the pacemaker interference. The interference thresholds found in the simulator indicate that pulsed magnetic fields are more likely to cause interference in pacemakers than sinusoidal fields. The security system simulator will help biomedical engineers, manufacturers of <b>medical</b> <b>devices,</b> and manufacturers of security systems to identify incompatible combinations of WTMDs and AIMDs early in the development stage.
