Much of the original church liturgical services functioned as a means of learning these works. Orthodox Church services today continue to serve this educational function. The issue of collecting the various works of the eastern churches and compiling them into a canon, each being confirmed as <b>authentic</b> <b>text</b> was a long protracted process. Much of this process was motivated by a need to address various heresies. In many instances, heretical groups had themselves begun compiling and disseminating text that they used to validate their positions, positions that were not consistent with the text, history and traditions of the Orthodox faith.|$|E

Before that, the work had suffered more serious damage, coming {{into the hands of}} Buck's great-nephew, George Buck, who used it as he did others of Buck's works: he produced manuscript copies that he dedicated to various patrons from whom he sought advancement, passing them off as his own. Gradually he altered the History, cutting it, making it look like something written in his own time, rather than earlier, by deleting names of Buck’s learned contemporaries who had shared sources and viva voce information with him, and altering or deleting documentation of sources, with the details of which, also, his copyist was careless. Finally in 1646 he published a version of the History that was slightly over half the length of the original. A second issue (usually referred to erroneously as a second edition) appeared the next year, leading to the assumption that Buck invented many of his sources. This damaged Buck's scholarly reputation for centuries. The <b>authentic</b> <b>text</b> of Buck's History was not published until 1979; the editor, Arthur Kincaid, was able to find all but seven of the hundreds of sources that Buck had meticulously documented.|$|E

It has unleashed new scholarly debates about the true theoretical status of Marx’s work on the falling rate of profit. Some (like Dr. Michael Heinrich) argue that the original manuscripts show, that Marx himself was really far less certain and complete in his arguments than Engels later presented him to be.

Furthermore, the paper aims to demonstrate the importance of proper text selection in relation to student motivation. To achieve this, a survey was conducted with second year students in two different schools; on top of this, several interviews were conducted with students as well as an interview with a teacher. This was done to demonstrate the different attitudes towards the textbook and <b>authentic</b> <b>texts</b> and to illustrate the importance of choosing topics that students can relate to. The results show that students preferred to read <b>authentic</b> <b>texts.</b> These texts provided them with interesting topics.

However, {{this does not}} mean that the students display oral proficiency, despite an emphasis on functional and communicative language skills in the current English Syllabus. While a previous literature study by this researcher has shown that <b>authentic</b> <b>texts</b> are a way to increase these skills, most of the results shown are from an international viewpoint. Thus an empirical study was conducted within Sweden with the aim to examine the use of <b>authentic</b> <b>texts</b> in the Swedish EFL upper elementary classroom. Twelve teachers have answered a questionnaire on how they use <b>authentic</b> <b>texts</b> in their language teaching, as well as their opinions about these as a teaching tool. Additionally, 37 students have answered a questionnaire on their attitudes about <b>authentic</b> <b>texts.</b> Results indicate that all of the teachers surveyed see <b>authentic</b> <b>texts</b> as an effective way to increase students’ communicative competence and English language skills; however, only a few use them with any frequency in language teaching. Furthermore, this seems to affect the students’ attitudes, since many say that they read <b>authentic</b> <b>texts</b> in their free time, but prefer to learn English out of a textbook at school. These findings are based on a small area of Sweden. Therefore, further research is needed to learn if these opinions hold true for the entire country or vary dependent upon region or other factors not taken into consideration in this study...|$|R

40|$|My {{hypothesis}} is that authentic materials will be more accessible to language learners with specifically designed language training materials that I will create, integrating reading skills, grammar topics and cultural knowledge, using modern research and theory in language education. Using the materials that I am proposing, students should be better prepared for language use and experience outside of the classroom as well. I intend to create language training materials for high‐intermediate to advanced students using <b>authentic</b> <b>texts</b> such as short stories, newspaper articles, poems, and famous essay. These texts will be supplemented with notes {{to assist with the}} understanding of vocabulary and cultural context. I will be writing original material in the form of explanations and activities that ensure students will focus on cultural and grammatical contexts as well, to help give students a greater understanding both of <b>authentic</b> <b>texts,</b> but also of United States culture, and American English from the past fifteen to twenty years in use. <b>Authentic</b> <b>texts,</b> such as newspaper articles, novels, or short stories, are often used for ESL/EFL learners in the classroom setting for their depictions of languagein‐ use. They are widely thought to give students more realistic linguistic examples as compared with traditional, simplified textbook language that is often presented in language textbooks. These materials are often adapted for the use of English learners in various countries, usually by means of simplification, so their language is closer {{to the level of the}} learners, often sounding stilted and inauthentic to native speakers, in order that the learners can more easily understand them. They are also generally somewhat deculturalized to account for the learner’s lack of knowledge cultural context of the original material. Bacon and Finnemann (1990), however, found that learners often preferred authentic reading material that related to current events, and to themselves. Young (1999) has found, as well, that evidence for the simplification of <b>authentic</b> <b>texts</b> being helpful for students is inconsistent at best, and that the most frequent problems encountered by English language learners are lexical in nature. I will get around the lexical problems Young discusses by providing vocabulary notes in the margins, with information on the difficulty of vocabulary, and thus the necessity of explaining it from English learner dictionaries. In this way, I will be able to get around lexical and cultural difficulties with reading <b>authentic</b> <b>texts,</b> and create a cohesive language training materials for students of English.

40|$|The present {{paper is}} aimed at {{providing}} a ref lection {{on the use of}} <b>authentic</b> <b>texts</b> in French as a foreign language classroom. The author bases herself on an analysis of texts taken from four textbook sets (Le nouveau sans fronti`eres, Panorama, Campus and Rond point), which were or are still used in teaching French as a foreign language. Initially, a definition of authenticity and a survey of authentic material usage through history are provided. In the overview of the texts forming the corpus the texts are divided into authentic, adapted, apparently authentic and those for which no assumption can be made as to their authenticity. The authenticity analysis is also carried out by taking into account the analysis of/categorisation into text types (according to Adam). The author proceeds from two premises, i. e. firstly she foresees that <b>authentic</b> <b>texts</b> will be present in all text books analysed and secondly, considering the greater accessibility of materials, that their presence will be more pronounced in recent textbooks. However, none of the two hypo theses is confirmed, as <b>authentic</b> <b>texts</b> are found in the first three textbook sets, but not in the most recent one, while their presence is most pronounced in the oldest textbook set, i. e. in Le nouveau sans fronti`eres.

This study was research and development. The subjects of the study were the fifth grade students of IES Darul Ulum Batang. The study followed eight steps namely conducting needs analysis, selecting the topics and objectives, writing the course grid, developing the first draft, evaluating and revising the first draft, trying out the second draft, evaluating and revising the second draft, and writing the final draft. The study used the questionnaires and the classroom observation guide as the data collection techniques. Hence, the data were analyzed quantitatively for the questionnaires and qualitatively for the classroom observation. Those data were used for obtaining the students’ needs analysis, for evaluating, and for revising the developed materials. Based on the research questions, four findings are obtained. First, the students need instructional reading materials using <b>authentic</b> <b>texts</b> which are suitable for their characteristics, needs, and interests. Second, the course grid of the developed materials consists of six components, i. e. standard of competence and basic competences, topics, indicators, learning materials, activities, and media.

The units are It’s Time to Watch TV, Where is the Museum?, Have a Nice Holiday, and Let’s Cook. Fourth, the developed materials are evaluated firstly by the respondents. The mean scores of the data range from 2. 05 to 3. 80 and need some revisions. After having been revised, the materials are tried out to the students and then evaluated by the students.
