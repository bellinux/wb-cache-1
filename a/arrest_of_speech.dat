40|$|Note: Manuscript very warped. Professor Wilder Penfield has accumulated, in {{a meticulous}} and {{laborious}} manner, data representing {{the effects of}} stimulation of the human cerebral cortex. Although these stimulations have been carried on for twenty odd years, it has been only during {{the past four years}} that more especial attention has been directed towards speech. In 1946, Dr. Preston Robb summarized the effect on speech of excising various cortical areas. These patients had had previous cerebral injuries with resultant focal cerebral seizures. Dr. Robb also began to assist Dr. Penfield in the operating room during the period of stimulation. The examination of patients before and after operation and the assistance in the operating theater have been and will be continued by this writer. The results of cortical stimulation on speech or, better, electrical arrest of certain speech mechanisms are presented at this time in order to summarize the present data and give suggestions for future study. Electrical arrest of three, or possibly four discrete cortical regions produces disturbances in speech other than simple <b>arrest</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech.</b> Few definite conclusions have been reached by either Dr. Robb or this author, but the groundwork has been laid. It is hoped and expected that a real contribution to the localization of areas producing specific speech defects and to the physiology of speech will be forthcoming at the conclusion of this project on stimulations and excisions of the cortex.

5|$|Morton's moves caused {{considerable}} rage {{among the}} Democrats, who launched a vicious {{attack on the}} governor. He responded by accusing his Democratic opponents of treason. Following {{the suppression of the}} General Assembly in 1862, Morton asked General Henry B. Carrington for assistance in organizing the state's levies for service. He also established an intelligence network under Carrington's leadership to deal with rebel sympathizers affiliated with the Knights of the Golden Circle, and, beginning in 1863, the American Knights, which merged with the Sons of Liberty. Members of these secret groups included Democrats and others who supported states-rights and opposed the Union cause during the war. Carrington succeeded in keeping the state secure, but his operatives also carried out arbitrary <b>arrests,</b> suppressed freedom <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> and freedom <b>of</b> association, and generally maintained repressive control over the southern-sympathetic minority. In an incident that would later be referred to as the Battle of Pogue's Run, Morton had soldiers disrupt a Democratic state convention, where many leaders of the Democratic Party were arrested, detained, or threatened. Morton also urged pro-war Democrats to abandon their party in the name of unity {{for the duration of the}} war, and met with some success. Former governor Joseph A. Wright was among the Democrats who had been expelled from the party in 1854, and in an attempt to show his bipartisanship, Morton appointed him to the U.S. Senate.|$|R

40|$|Following World War I and the Bolshevik Revolutions, America 2 ̆ 7 s Red Scare began, inciting fanatical {{patriotism and}} an alleged threat of anarchy that gripped {{a nation with}} fear. Paranoia about communists, Socialists, and anarchists divided the country and {{resulted}} in many states, including Arkansas, passing criminal anarchy laws. Since a majority of those accused of anti-American activities were involved in labor disputes, Arkansas makes for an interesting case study; {{not only did it}} have a relative lack of labor disputes, it still passed anti-Bolshevik laws. The purpose of this research is to develop an understanding {{of the ways in which}} dissenters have been effectively silenced by the controlling power and the consequences of that hegemonic silence. To illustrate this, I will use a First Amendment framework to examine four incidents: the 1934 <b>arrest</b> <b>of</b> George Cruz in Mississippi County; the 1935 <b>arrest</b> <b>of</b> Ward Rodgers in Poinsett County; the 1935 <b>arrest</b> <b>of</b> Horace Bryan in Sebastian County; and the 1940 <b>arrest</b> <b>of</b> Nathan Oser in Polk County. In analyzing these cases, I argue that limitations on freedom <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> serve the agenda of the establishment. Furthermore, these limitations serve to economically punish dissenters and rhetorical construct dissenters as criminals. This study proposes a new perspective on the negative effect that First Amendment limitations can have on America society. These cases are indicative of the politically charged environment that existed in the South during the Red Scare and illustrate the ways that power is used to silence poor and working class Americans...|$|R
