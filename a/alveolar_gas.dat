They were able to delineate the pathways of change which are con-trolled by the excretion of carbon dioxide, and ob-serve the effects of hyperpnea, hypoxia, hypo-ventilation and CO 2 breathing as well. Pelnar (2), at first independently and later in conjunc-tion with Rahn, observed the changes in expired air composition in normal subjects {{as well as in}} patients with cardiorespiratory impairment in rela-tion to work. By means of a simple diagram re-lating the changes in 02 and CO 2 content of ex-pired air with the respiratory quotient during the stress of exercise, he felt that he could delineate respiratory function better than by any other means in a manner that paralleled the intensity of dyspnea in patients. Between the extremes of a) normal performance with a large circular curve and b) the abnormal performance with no change in these values during exercise, Pelnar found a series of results which were characteristic of the varied stages of dyspnea. Thus he was able to evaluate functional performance largely in terms of changes in the respiratory gases during exercise.

40|$|The human {{pulmonary}} vasculature constricts {{in response to}} hypercapnia and hypoxia, with important consequences for homeostasis and adaptation. One function of these responses is to direct blood flow away from poorly-ventilated regions of the lung. In humans {{it is not known}} whether the stimuli of hypercapnia and hypoxia constrict the pulmonary blood vessels independently of each other or whether they act synergistically, such that the combination of hypercapnia and hypoxia is more effective than the sum of the responses to each stimulus on its own. We independently controlled the alveolar partial pressures of carbon dioxide (Paco 2) and oxygen (Pao 2) to examine their possible interaction on human pulmonary vasoconstriction. Nine volunteers each experienced sixteen possible combinations of four levels of Paco 2 (+ 6, + 1, - 4 and - 9 mmHg, relative to baseline) with four levels of Pao 2 (175, 100, 75 and 50 mmHg). During each of these sixteen protocols Doppler echocardiography was used to evaluate cardiac output and systolic tricuspid pressure gradient, an index of pulmonary vasoconstriction. The degree of constriction varied linearly with both Paco 2 and the calculated haemoglobin oxygen desaturation (1 -So 2). Mixed effects modelling delivered coefficients defining the interdependence of cardiac output, systolic tricuspid pressure gradient, ventilation, Paco 2 and So 2. No interaction was observed in the effects on pulmonary vasoconstriction of carbon dioxide and oxygen (p> 0. 64). Direct effects of the <b>alveolar</b> <b>gases</b> on systolic tricuspid pressure gradient greatly exceeded indirect effects arising from concurrent changes in cardiac output...|$|R

This conclusion matches those of other authors [120, 129 – 131]. Collectively, the wealth of published evidence supports the conclusion that, if the acute stage of pulmonary edema with its attendant anoxic anoxia is survived, circulatory failure may become a more important factor in the ultimate outcome [65]. Likewise, a countermeasure identified to be efficacious for a non-water-soluble gas, such as phosgene, may not necessarily be the best countermeasure for a highly water-soluble airway and <b>alveolar</b> irritant <b>gas,</b> such as chlorine, and vice versa.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects on}} the {{pulmonary}} circulation of breathing 10 % CO 2 for 10 to 20 min were studied in five eucapnic and 11 convalescing hypercapnic patients to recreate the CO 2 tensions which they had experienced during respiratory failure. Right heart catheterization permitted measurements of pulmonary arterial and wedge pressures and obtaining samples of mixed venous blood. Breathing CO 2 increased mean pulmonary arterial pressures from 33 to 50 mm Hg (52 %); pulmonary arterial wedge pressures were unchanged, and cardiac output increased only 22 %. In three hypercapnic and two eucapnic subjects reduction of blood hydrogen ion levels by rapid infusion of 120 to 135 mEq NaHCO 3 during CO 9 breathing did not lower pulmonary arterial pressure significantly, nor raise cardiac output. Neither vascular pressures nor cardiac outputs changed during oxygen breathing. Larger increases in cardiac output, which were produced by exercise, raised pulmonary artery pressure only {{half as much as}} breathing 10 % CO 2 did. Therefore, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) that was elevated to an average of 4. 8 mm Hg/L/min at rest while breathing air was increased to 6. 5 mm Hg/L/min during CO 2 breathing (P< 0. 01). In contrast, PVR was unchanged (4. 6 mm Hg/L/min) during exercise. This difference between PVR while breathing CO 2 and during exercise was statistically significant (P < 0. 02). Restoration of the pH of the blood toward normal by the infusion of bicarbonate during breathing of CO 2 raised the pulmonary arterial pressure. The five eucapnic subjects showed similar changes during CO 2 breathing and exercise, although their base-line values were sig-nificantly different. The differences were due, at least in part, to lower Paco 2. This evidence suggests that CO 2 acts on pulmonary arterioles and capillaries that are exposed to <b>alveolar</b> <b>gases</b> to increase the pulmonary vascular impedance...|$|R

40|$|Our current {{understanding}} of the transport and deposition of aerosols (viruses, bacteria, air pollutants, aerosolized drugs) deep in the lung has been grounded in dispersive theories based on untested assumptions {{about the nature of}} acinar airflow fields.

In this article, we apply the recently discovered fluid mechanical phenomenon of irreversible low-Reynolds number flow to the lung. We demonstrate, through flow visualization studies in rhythmically ventilated rat lungs, that such a foundation is false, and that chaotic mixing may be key to aerosol transport. We found substantial alveolar flow irreversibility with stretched and folded fractal patterns, which lead to a sudden increase in mixing. These findings support our theory that chaotic alveolar flow—characterized by stagnation saddle points associated with <b>alveolar</b> vortices—governs <b>gas</b> kinematics in the lung periphery, and hence the transport, mixing, and ultimately the deposition of fine aerosols.

40|$|RATIONALE: Improved {{ventilation}} {{strategies have}} been the mainstay for reducing mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Their unique clinical effectiveness is, however, unmatched by {{our understanding of the}} underlying mechanobiology, and their impact on <b>alveolar</b> dynamics and <b>gas</b> exchange remains largely speculative. OBJECTIVES: To assess changes in alveolar dynamics and associated effects on local gas exchange in experimental models of acute lung injury (ALI) and their responsiveness to sighs. METHODS: Alveolar dynamics and local gas exchange were studied in vivo by darkfield microscopy and multispectral oximetry in experimental murine models of ALI induced by hydrochloric acid, Tween instillation, or in antibody-mediated transfusion-related ALI. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Independent of injury mode, ALI resulted in asynchronous alveolar ventilation characteristic of alveolar pendelluft, which either spontaneously resolved or progressed to a complete cessation or even inversion of alveolar ventilation. The functional relevance of the latter phenomena was evident as impaired blood oxygenation in juxtaposed lung capillaries. Individual sighs (2 × 10 s at inspiratory plateau pressure of 30 cm H 2 O) largely restored normal <b>alveolar</b> dynamics and <b>gas</b> exchange in acid-induced ALI, yet not in Tween-induced surfactant depletion. CONCLUSIONS: We describe {{for the first time in}} detail the different forms and temporal sequence of impaired alveolar dynamics in the acutely injured lung and report the first direct visualization of alveolar pendelluft. Moreover, we identify individual sighs as an effective strategy to restore intact alveolar ventilation by a mechanism independent of alveolar collapse and reopening...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. The {{purpose of}} these studies was to {{evaluate}} the influence of perfusate oxygen tension on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and to identify the site at which both <b>alveolar</b> and perfusate <b>gas</b> tensions stimulate hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Lungs from adult rats were ventilated and perfused in vitro at constant temperature, Pco 2, and pH, with a perfusion circuit incorporating a membrane oxygenator that allowed independent control of the <b>alveolar</b> and perfusate <b>gas</b> tensions. Blood flow to the lung was constant (0. 06 ml per g body weight per min), and pulmonary vascular resistance was therefore proportional to pulmonary artery pressure. In study 1, the pulmonary artery pressor response to zero or 22 mm Hg alveolar oxygen was measured when the perfusate oxygen tensions were approximately 8, 26, 41, 64, or 128 mm Hg. The pressor response {{as a percent of}} the maximum pressure change was progressively reduced as perfusate oxygen tension increased. For alveolar oxygen tension of zero; the pressor response = 128 — 39 (Log PPO 2) a nd r = 0. 8 (P < 0. 01), the effect of perfusate gas tension on the response to alveloar gas tension of 22 mm Hg was similar. These results demonstrate that the stimulus for hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is a function of both alveolar and perfusate oxygen tension. In study 2, the response to alveolar oxygen tension of 42 mm Hg was measured with mean perfusate oxygen tensions of 130, 52, and 17 mm Hg. In si...|$|R

40|$|The {{volume and}} {{composition}} of fluid {{on the surface of}} the alveoli can affect <b>alveolar</b> ventilation, <b>gas</b> diffusion, and macrophage function. The passive permeability and active processes of the alveolar epithelial lining play a role in regulating surface fluid and are a potential site of damage by airborne chemicals. Like other epithelial barriers, the alveolar lining is permeable to lipophilic substances but restricts the transmural flow of small ions and hydrophilic nonelectrolytes (equivalent pore radius ca. 0. 5 - 1. 5 nm). The mammalian fetal lung and alveolar sacs of the adult bullfrog secrete Cl- and K+ into the airspace. Secretion by the fetal lung ceases at birth. Many environmental agents increase the permeability of the capillary endothelium and/or respiratory epithelium and induce pulmonary edema. Studies with bullfrog alveolar sacs have demonstrated that selective effects may or may not be followed by general derangement of the epithelial barrier. Exposure of the luminal surface to HgCI 2 (10 - 6 to 10 - 4 M) induces a selective increase in Cl- secretion that is followed by a fall in transport and a general increase in ion permeation. CdCl 2 (10 -s to 10 - 3 M) depresses ciliomotion on cells on the trabecula of the alveolus but does not affect Cl- secretion or transepithelial conductance. HNO 3, like other mineral acids, increases conductance and the radii of pores in the barrier, whereas NaNO 3 selectively inhibits Cl- secretion. Amphotericin B (10 - 7 to 10 - 5 M) induces K+ secretion into the lumen of both bullfrog and rat lung. We conclude that environmental agents induce changes in epithelial function that may compromise the lung's ability to regulate respiratory fluid without destroying the characteristic permeability of the epithelial lining...|$|R

Mouse embryos lacking Pbx 1 in the lung mesenchyme show compact terminal saccules and perinatal lethality with failure of postnatal alveolar expansion. Mutant embryos had severely reduced expression of Fgf 10 and surfactant genes (Spa, Spb, Spc, and Spd) that are essential for <b>alveolar</b> expansion for <b>gas</b> exchange at birth.
