25|$|Sulfur mustard {{was used}} as a {{chemical}} weapon in World War I and more recently in the Iran–Iraq War. Sulfur mustard is a vesicant <b>alkylating</b> <b>agent</b> with strong cytotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic properties. After exposure, victims show skin irritations and blisters. This agent also causes respiratory tract lesions, bone marrow depression, and eye damage, the epithelial tissues of these organs being predominately affected. Inhalation of high doses of this gas causes lesions in the larynx, trachea, and large bronchi with inflammatory reactions and necrosis. The <b>alkylating</b> <b>agent</b> affects more the upper parts of the respiratory tract, and only intensely exposed victims showed signs like bronchiolitis obliterans in the distal part. Secondary effects of sulfur mustard exposure lead to chronic lung diseases such as chronic bronchitis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alkylating</b> antineoplastic <b>agents</b> have limitations. Their {{functionality}} {{has been}} found to be limited when in the presence of the DNA-repair enzyme O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Cross-linking of double-stranded DNA by <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> is inhibited by the cellular DNA-repair mechanism, MGMT. If the MGMT promoter region is methylated, the cells no longer produce MGMT, and are therefore more responsive to <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents.</b> Methylation of the MGMT promoter in gliomas is a useful predictor of the responsiveness of tumors to <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents.</b>|$|R
50|$|Halocarbons {{in general}} are {{potentially}} dangerous <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents.</b> Bromides are better <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> than chlorides, thus exposure to EtBr should be minimized. EtBr is classified by the State of California as carcinogenic and a reproductive toxin.|$|R

25|$|Acrolein is a {{pyrolysis}} {{product that is}} abundant in cigarette smoke. It gives smoke an acrid smell and an irritating, lachrymatory effect and is {{a major contributor to}} its carcinogenicity. Like PAH metabolites, acrolein is also an electrophilic <b>alkylating</b> <b>agent</b> and permanently binds to the DNA base guanine, by a conjugate addition followed by cyclization into a hemiaminal. The acrolein-guanine adduct induces mutations during DNA copying and thus causes cancers {{in a manner similar to}} PAHs. However, acrolein is 1000 times more abundant than PAHs in cigarette smoke and is able to react as is, without metabolic activation. Acrolein has been shown to be a mutagen and carcinogen in human cells. The carcinogenicity of acrolein has been difficult to study by animal experimentation, because it has such a toxicity that it tends to kill the animals before they develop cancer. Generally, compounds able to react by conjugate addition as electrophiles (so-called Michael acceptors after Michael reaction) are toxic and carcinogenic, because they can permanently alkylate DNA, similarly to mustard gas or aflatoxin. Acrolein is only one of them present in cigarette smoke; for example, crotonaldehyde has been found in cigarette smoke. Michael acceptors also contribute to the chronic inflammation present in tobacco disease.|$|E

5000|$|Samson {{specializes in}} human DNA repair. Specifically, her lab's {{goal is to}} [...] "understand the biology, the biochemistry, and the {{genetics}} of numerous DNA repair pathways that act upon DNA alkylation damage." [...] This is applicable to human cancer research, because <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> are used extensively in chemotherapy and other cancer treatments. She is researching [...] "how eukaryotic cells respond to alkylating agents." [...] <b>Alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> are drugs which work by replacing a hydrogen with an alkyl group, with the end result being DNA damage. [...] <b>Alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> inhibit protein synthesis and damages rapidly dividing cells, among which cancer cells are primarily affected because they divide so rapidly.

40|$|Improvements in the {{treatment}} of can-cer have led to increased survival rates among adolescent and young adult (AYA) males. Among oncologists, there has been increasing consensus that fertil-ity preserving techniques such as sperm banking should be offered to AYA males before initiating treatment with gonado-toxic <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> such as cyclo-phosphamide (CPO). 1 This wariness concerning the use of <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> without mitigating their toxic effects stems from the physician’s duty to do no harm.

50|$|Since cancer cells, in general, proliferate {{faster and}} with less error-correcting than healthy cells, cancer cells are more {{sensitive}} to DNA damage—such as being alkylated. <b>Alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> are used to treat several cancers. However, they are also toxic to normal cells (cytotoxic), particularly cells that divide frequently, {{such as those in}} the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, testicles and ovaries, which can cause loss of fertility. Most of the <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> are also carcinogenic. Hyperthermia therapy is especially effective at enhancing the effects of <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has {{reviewed}} aziridine {{compounds and}} classified them as possibly carcinogenic to humans (IARC Group 2B).

2500|$|The risks {{involved}} {{seem to be}} related both to the duration and to the dosage used. People who have previously been treated with an <b>alkylating</b> <b>agent</b> may have an excessive risk of cancers if treated with azathioprine.

40|$|Intrinsic or {{acquired}} chemoresistance to <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> is a {{major cause}} of treatment failure in patients with malignant brain tumors. <b>Alkylating</b> <b>agents,</b> the mainstay of treatment for brain tumors, damage the DNA and induce apoptosis, but the cytotoxic activity of these agents is dependent on DNA repair pathways. For example, O 6 -methylguanine DNA adducts can cause double-strand breaks, but this is dependent on a functional mismatch repair pathway. Thus, tumor cell lines deficient in mismatch repair are resistant to <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents.</b> Perhaps the most important mechanism of resistance to <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> is the DNA repair enzyme O 6 -methylguanine methyltransferase, which can eliminate the cytotoxic O 6 -methylguanine DNA adduct before it causes harm. Another mechanism of resistance to <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> is the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Consequently, efforts are ongoing to develop effective inhibitors of BER. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase plays a pivotal role in BER and is an important therapeutic target. Developing effective strategies to overcome chemoresistance requires the identification of reliable preclinical models that recapitulate human disease and which can be used to facilitate drug development. This article describes the diverse mechanisms of chemoresistance operating in malignant glioma and efforts to develop reliable preclinical models and novel pharmacologic approaches to overcome resistance to <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> on histone acetyltransferase (EC 2. 3. 1. 48) {{activity}} and thymidine incorporation {{was investigated in}} benign and malignant proliferating rat liver tissue and compared with the effect in normal non-proliferating rat liver tissue. In both, benign and malignant proliferating tissue, but not in quiescent tissue, the histone acetylation is depressed by <b>alkylating</b> <b>agents</b> and this depression correlates with the inhibition of the thymidine incorporation.

2500|$|The postmeiotic {{phase of}} mouse {{spermatogenesis}} is {{very sensitive to}} environmental genotoxic agents, because as male germ cells form mature spermatozoa they progressively lose the ability to repair DNA damage. [...] Irradiation of male mice during late spermatogenesis can induce damage that persists for at least 7 days in the fertilizing spermatozoa, and disruption of maternal DNA double-strand break repair pathways increases spermatozoa-derived chromosomal aberrations. [...] Treatment of male mice with melphalan, a bifunctional <b>alkylating</b> <b>agent</b> frequently employed in chemotherapy, induces DNA lesions during meiosis that may persist in an unrepaired state as germ cells progress though DNA repair-competent phases of spermatogenic development. [...] Such unrepaired DNA damages in spermatozoa, after fertilization, can lead to offspring with various abnormalities.|$|E
2500|$|Triphenylphosphine is {{commonly}} {{employed as a}} precursor to other organophosphines. [...] Lithium in THF and Na or K in NH3 react with PPh3 to give Ph2PM (M = Li, Na, K).

[...] Treatment of the resulting alkali metal diphenylphosphide with an <b>alkylating</b> <b>agent</b> RX gives PRPh2. [...] This method {{can be used to}} prepare such ligands as PMePh2, methyldiphenylphosphine. [...] The corresponding reaction with dihaloalkanes gives bis(diphenylphosphino)alkanes.
