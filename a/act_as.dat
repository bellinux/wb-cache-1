5|$|Bupropion is {{also known}} to <b>act</b> <b>as</b> a non-competitive {{antagonist}} of the α3β2, α3β4, α4β2, and, very weakly, α7 nACh receptors, and these actions appear to be importantly involved in its beneficial properties not only in smoking cessation, but in depression as well. The metabolites of bupropion also <b>act</b> <b>as</b> non-competitive antagonists of these nACh receptors, and hydroxybupropion is even more potent in comparison. At therapeutically-relevant concentrations bupropion and hydroxybupropion <b>act</b> <b>as</b> negative allosteric modulators of the serotonin 5-HT3A receptor. Pharmacological data on bupropion and its metabolites are shown in the table. Bupropion is known to weakly inhibit the α1 adrenergic receptor, with a 14% potency of its dopamine uptake inhibition, and the H1 receptor, with a 9% potency.|$|E

5|$|In many bacteria, an S-layer of rigidly arrayed protein {{molecules}} {{covers the}} outside of the cell.

5|$|In many organisms, inhibitors may <b>act</b> <b>as</b> {{part of a}} {{feedback}} mechanism. If {{an enzyme}} produces too much of one substance in the organism, that substance may <b>act</b> <b>as</b> an inhibitor for the enzyme {{at the beginning of}} the pathway that produces it, causing production of the substance to slow down or stop when there is sufficient amount. This is a form of negative feedback. Major metabolic pathways such as the citric acid cycle make use of this mechanism.|$|E

5|$|Some {{compounds}} {{have been}} identified to bind cNTnC with low affinity and <b>act</b> <b>as</b> troponin activators: DFBP-O (a structural analog of levosimendan), 4-(4-(2,5-dimethylphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)-3-pyridinamine (NCI147866), and bepridil. The calmodulin antagonist, W7, has also been found to bind to cNTnC to <b>act</b> <b>as</b> a troponin inhibitor. All of these compounds bind to the hydrophobic patch in the open conformation of cNTnC, with troponin activators promoting interaction with the cTnI switch peptide and troponin inhibitors destabilizing the interaction.|$|E
