5|$|After the Ottomans assumed {{power in}} 1517, {{they did not}} {{undertake}} any major renovations or repairs to the mosque itself, but they did to the Noble Sanctuary as a whole. This included {{the building of the}} Fountain of Qasim Pasha (1527), the restoration of the Pool of Raranj, and the building of three free-standing domes—the most notable being the Dome of the Prophet built in 1538. All construction was ordered by the Ottoman governors of Jerusalem <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> sultans themselves. The sultans did make additions to existing minarets, however. In 1816, the mosque was restored by Governor Sulayman Pasha al-Adil after having been in a dilapidated state.|$|E

However, in exchange for local police, fire protection and other services, the United Nations agrees to acknowledge most local, state, and federal laws.|$|E

5|$|An {{incidental}} finding {{associated with}} this condition is a heel spur, a small bony calcification on the calcaneus (heel bone), {{which can be found}} in up to 50% of those with plantar fasciitis. In such cases, it is the underlying plantar fasciitis that produces the heel pain, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> spur itself. The condition is responsible for the creation of the spur though the clinical significance of heel spurs in plantar fasciitis remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|Apart from organising the federation, Welensky won a {{significant}} political battle in Northern Rhodesia against the British South Africa Company (BSAC), which controlled mineral {{rights and the}} associated royalties throughout the territory. The company, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> British crown, had signed the treaties with African kings that surrendered mining rights, but the BSAC had stopped administering Northern Rhodesia in 1924. Welensky argued that the territory {{had a right to}} the royalties, and petitioned the governor to take action. After many talks, the BSAC relented and agreed to surrender mineral rights in 1986, and to pay 20% of its profits from these rights to the government until then.|$|E

Back at her house, Destiny greets her friend Nakeisha Johnson, who tells her Renz was left out of the camp {{yearbook}} and there are no photos of him. From this, Destiny determines that Renz is actually a vampire <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> Restorer.|$|E

5|$|Between September 2008 and December 2010, twenty-two spectra were {{collected}} using the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) instrument at Hawaii's W.M. Keck Observatory. This data {{was used to}} derive HAT-P-33's radial velocity. A far greater number of spectra were gathered for HAT-P-33 than the number usually gathered for planetary candidates {{to compensate for the}} data's jitter effect. It was concluded that the jitter in the data was caused by stellar activity <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> presence of other planets.|$|E

5|$|Errors of law {{committed}} by public authorities when they act or make decisions {{are within the}} jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore to correct by way of judicial review. On the other hand, the Court is generally unwilling to intervene where the alleged error is one that concerns the facts of the matter. The rationale for this rule is that it is the Court's role in judicial review of administrative action to scrutinize the legality <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> merits of the decisions of public authorities.|$|E

5|$|Harrison County was {{originally}} part of Knox County and Clark County but was separated in 1808. It {{was the first}} Indiana county formed by the Indiana territorial legislature <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> Governor. The county originally contained land that is now parts of Crawford, Floyd, Washington, Jackson, Clark, Lawrence, Perry, Scott and Orange Counties. The county was named for William Henry Harrison, the first governor of Indiana Territory, and later a General in War of 1812, hero of Tippecanoe, and the 9th U.S. President. Harrison was the largest land holder in the county {{at the time and}} had a small estate at Harrison Spring.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Rockefeller {{unveiled}} {{plans for}} the Potantico Expressway, a connector from the to-be-constructed Hudson River Expressway (NY9A) to the Taconic State Parkway. Some opposition to the idea arose {{on the grounds that}} the new highway would only benefit the Rockefeller estate <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> residents. Nonetheless, construction began on the Potantico Expressway (now known as Phelps Way) in 1969. When the highway was completed in November1970, it became part of a rerouted NY117. NY117's former alignment along Bedford Road became NY448. The Hudson River Expressway project was cancelled in 1971, and the western stub of the expressway now serves Phelps Hospital.|$|E

5|$|In {{exploring}} {{the similarities between}} Sjair Abdoel Moeloek and Siti Akbari, Zaini-Lajoubert notes that {{the names of the}} individual kingdoms, save Barham (Barbam in Siti Akbari), are taken directly from the earlier work. Names of characters, such as Abdul Muluk (in Siti Akbari, Abdul Moelan) and Siti Rapiah (Siti Akbari), are simply replaced, although some minor characters are present in one story <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> other. The main plot elements in both stories are the same; some elements, such as the birth and childhood of Abdul Muluk and the later adventures of Siti Rapiah's son, are present in one story <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> other– or given more detail. The two differ greatly in their styles, especially Lie's emphasis on description and realism.|$|E
5|$|In {{many social}} insect communities, sex is {{determined}} through haplodiploidy. Haploid male drones develop from unfertilized eggs while diploid females develop from fertilized eggs. Queens of a colony may mate {{with one or}} several drones. On average, a queen shares half of her genes with her sons, but only shares a quarter of her genes with the sons of fertile female workers. Therefore, {{it is in the}} queen's best interests to have her own sons raised, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> sons of workers. Workers can reproduce in many ants, bees, and wasps because male offspring come from unfertilized eggs.|$|E

An American-trained outfit created to fight the Việt Cộng, the Special Forces were better-equipped, better-trained and better-paid than the regular army, but were used by the Ngô family as a private army for repressing dissidents and protecting their rule, rather than fighting for the national interest. As such, they spent {{the majority of their}} time in Saigon warding off coup attempts. Tung brought more Special Forces into Saigon, bringing the total from two to four battalions in the capital.|$|E
