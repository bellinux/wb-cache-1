La Casa Colorada houses the Museum of Santiago, while the Colonial Museum is housed in a wing of the Church of San Francisco and the Museum of Pre-Columbian Art occupies part of the old Palacio de la Aduana. The Museum of Fine Arts, though it is located in the city center, was built in the early twentieth century, especially for housing the museum <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the building was laid in 1947, the Museum of Contemporary Art, under the Faculty of Arts of the University of Chile.|$|E

The video returns to the present where the woman has parked her car in a road near a rice field at night. When Jieun starts {{to sing the}} second chorus, the woman opens her car trunk in a straight-on view, revealing a captive man (Kim Him Chan) who had been blindfolded and tied up with rope. The woman takes a jug of gasoline in the trunk of her car and kisses the man. She then pours gasoline on the prisoner and backs up a distance from the car. The video ends with the woman igniting her lighter and throwing it in the pool of gasoline. [...] The video ends before the car explodes.|$|E

6000|$|No {{doubt the}} thought that was {{uppermost}} in a thousand of those vigilant minds, even as it was uppermost in mine, was the riddle--how much they understood of us. Did they grasp that we in our millions were organized, disciplined, working together? Or did they interpret our spurts of fire, the sudden stinging of our shells, our steady investment of their encampment, as we should the furious unanimity of onslaught in a disturbed hive of bees? Did they dream they might exterminate us? (At that time {{no one knew what}} food they needed.) A hundred such questions struggled together in my mind as I watched that vast sentinel shape. <b>And</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of my mind was the sense of all the huge unknown and hidden forces Londonward.

60|$|Lotta Luxa {{was a sharp}} little woman, {{over forty}} years of age, with quick green eyes and thin red-tipped nose, looking as though Paris {{might have been the}} town of her birth rather than Prague. She wore short petticoats, clean stockings, an old pair of slippers; <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of her hair she still carried that Diana's dart which maidens wear in those parts when they are not only maidens unmarried, but maidens also disengaged. No one had yet succeeded in drawing Lotta Luxa's arrow from her head, though Souchey, {{from the other side of}} the river, had made {{repeated}} attempts to do so. For Lotta Luxa had a little money of her own, and poor Souchey had none. Lotta muttered something about the thoughtless thanklessness of young people, and then took herself down-stairs. Nina opened the door of the back parlour, and found her cousin Ziska sitting alone with his feet propped upon the stove.|$|E
60|$|Mr. George {{then left}} the ship {{and went back to}} the office in Wall Street, to engage the berths and pay the passage money. The office was spacious and handsomely furnished, and there were several clerks in it writing at desks. There were two rooms, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> room was a table, with large plans of the ship upon it, on which all the cabins and state rooms of the several decks were {{represented}} in their proper positions. The names of the various passengers that had engaged passage in the ship were written in the several state rooms which they had chosen. The clerk wrote the names, Master Holiday and Miss Holiday, in the state rooms which Mr. George pointed out to him, and, when he had done so, Mr. George looked over all the other names that had been written in before, to see if there were any persons whom he knew among them. To his great gratification he found that there were several such.|$|E

40|$|A simple {{analytical}} model of water transport <b>in</b> <b>the</b> polymer electrolyte fuel cell is developed. Nonlinear membrane resistance and voltage loss due to incomplete membrane humidification are calculated. Both values depend on parameter r, {{the ratio of}} mass transport coefficients of water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> membrane <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> layer. Simple equation for cell performance curve, which incorporates the effect of cathodic water is constructed. Depending {{of the value of}} r, the cell may operate <b>in</b> one of <b>the</b> two regimes. When r {{greater than or equal to}} 1, incomplete membrane humidification simply reduces cell voltage; the limiting current density is determined by oxygen transport <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> layer (oxygen-limiting regime). If r < 1, limiting current density is determined by membrane drying (water-limiting regime). In that case there exists optimal current density, which provides minimal membrane resistance. It is shown that membrane drying may lead to parasitic "in-plane" proton current. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

60|$|Next {{holidays}} he was {{out with}} Mahbub, and here, by the way, he nearly died of thirst, plodding through the sand on a camel to the mysterious city of Bikanir, where the wells are four hundred feet deep, and lined throughout with camel-bone. It was not an amusing trip from Kim's point of view, because--in defiance of the contract--the Colonel ordered {{him to make a}} map of that wild, walled city; and since Mohammedan horse-boys and pipe-tenders are not expected to drag Survey-chains round the capital of an independent Native State, Kim was forced to pace all his distances by means of a bead rosary. He used the compass for bearings as occasion served--after dark chiefly, when the camels had been fed--and by the help of his little Survey paint-box of six colour-cakes and three brushes, he achieved something not remotely unlike the city of Jeysulmir. Mahbub laughed a great deal, and advised him to make up a written report as well; <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the big account-book that lay under the flap of Mahbub's pet saddle Kim fell to work..|$|E

60|$|I came to {{the city}} of Antung, and lodged with a merchant. He was a grain merchant. Corn he had, {{hundreds}} of bushels, stored in great bins of stout matting; peas and beans in sacks, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> yard his millstones went round and round, grinding out meal. Also, in his back yard, were buildings containing vats sunk into the ground, and here the tanners were at work making leather. I bought a measure of corn from mine host for my horses, and he overcharged me thirty cents. I was in China. Antung was jammed with Japanese troops. It was the thick of war. But it did not matter. The work of Antung went on just the same. The shops were wide open; the streets were lined with pedlars. One could buy anything; get anything made. I dined at a Chinese restaurant, cleansed myself at a public bath in a private tub with a small boy to assist in the scrubbing. I bought condensed milk, bitter, canned vegetables, bread, and cake. I repeat it, cake--good cake. I bought knives, forks, and spoons, granite-ware dishes and mugs. There were horseshoes and horseshoers. A worker in iron realized for me new designs of mine for my tent poles. My shoes were sent out to be repaired. A barber shampooed my hair. A servant returned with corn-beef in tins, a bottle of port, another of cognac, and beer, blessed beer, to wash out from my throat the dust of an army. It was the land of Canaan. I was in China.|$|E
