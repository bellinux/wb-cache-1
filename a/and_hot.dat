5|$|Tantalum is inert against most acids except {{hydrofluoric}} acid <b>and</b> <b>hot</b> sulfuric acid, <b>and</b> <b>hot</b> alkaline solutions also cause tantalum to corrode. This property {{makes it a}} useful metal for chemical reaction vessels and pipes for corrosive liquids. Heat exchanging coils for the steam heating of hydrochloric acid are made from tantalum. Tantalum was extensively used {{in the production of}} ultra high frequency electron tubes for radio transmitters. The tantalum is capable of capturing oxygen and nitrogen by forming nitrides and oxides and therefore helps to sustain the high vacuum needed for the tubes.|$|E

40|$|Physiological {{needs for}} thermal comfort, {{nutritional}} comfort, and healthiness make colder <b>and</b> <b>hotter</b> climates more demanding than more temperate climates. Affluence {{may help to}} meet those thermal demands. Two country-level studies indeed show that thermal demands (colder <b>and</b> <b>hotter</b> climates) <b>and</b> wealth-related resources (higher income per capita) are joint roots of happiness (N = 55) and altruism (N = 71). In colder climates richer societies are more but poorer societies are less happy <b>and</b> altruistic. In <b>hotter</b> climates richer societies are happier but poorer societies are unhappier. In both colder <b>and</b> <b>hotter</b> climates richer societies tend to be happier {{at the expense of}} being more altruistic whereas poorer societies tend to be more altruistic at the expense of being happier. The findings generate a demands-resources theory on self- and other-directed consequences of thermoclimate. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
