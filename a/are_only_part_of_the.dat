500|$|Finally, it {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the remaining papyrus fragments <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complete original papyri. Contemporary accounts refer to [...] "a long roll" [...] or multiple [...] "rolls" [...] of papyrus. In 1968, Walter Whipple estimated that the fragments constituted roughly one-third of Smith's original collection of papyri. Later, in 2000, Mormon Egyptologist John Gee provided a graphical comparison of the relative extent of the known fragments to other complete examples of similar scrolls, which indicated the total at about twenty percent. Others, however, have challenged this notion, contending {{that the majority of}} the papyri have been recovered. Andrew Cook and Christopher Smith, for example, argue that, based on a physical analysis of fragments from the scroll of Hôr, only 56 centimeters could be missing from that scroll. This contrasts with an LDS scholar's earlier estimate for the length of the missing portion. Still others have suggest that fragments may have only been a starting point for reconstruction.|$|E
