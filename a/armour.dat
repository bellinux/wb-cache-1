5|$|Distinguished Maya warriors entered battle wearing <b>armour.</b> The {{upper body}} {{was covered by}} a short jacket that was filled with rock salt, and the forearms and legs were {{protected}} with tight bindings of cloth or leather. The salt-packed cotton <b>armour</b> was tough enough that even arrows could not penetrate it. <b>Armour</b> could be decorated and was often adorned with feathers. Commoners did not wear <b>armour</b> in battle, usually only wearing a loincloth and warpaint. Warriors carried shields made from two right-angled wooden bars with deerskin stretched across them.|$|E

5|$|For {{personal}} protection, most Roman troops wore metal body <b>armour</b> (usually in {{the form}} a chain mail cuirass) and helmets, in addition to shields. In contrast, among the Alamanni, metal <b>armour</b> and helmets were probably owned {{by members of the}} social elite only. Most Alamanni foot soldiers had only shields and no metal <b>armour</b> or helmets.|$|E

5|$|Full-scale <b>armour</b> trials {{revealed}} serious {{weaknesses in}} the proposed protection scheme. The trials employed the obsolete ironclad , modified with <b>armour</b> protection identical to that used by the s then under construction. The deck and turret roof <b>armour</b> proved to be too thin, and the structure supporting the side <b>armour</b> was {{not strong enough to}} withstand the shock of impact from heavy shells.|$|E
5|$|Other common {{applications}} include shipbuilding, pipelines, mining, offshore construction, aerospace, {{white goods}} (e.g. washing machines), heavy {{equipment such as}} bulldozers, office furniture, steel wool, tools, and <b>armour</b> {{in the form of}} personal vests or vehicle <b>armour</b> (better known as rolled homogeneous <b>armour</b> in this role).|$|E
5|$|The battleships of {{the late}} 1880s, for {{instance}} the , were armoured with iron and steel compound <b>armour.</b> This was soon replaced with more effective case-hardened steel <b>armour</b> made using the Harvey process developed in the United States. First tested in 1891, Harvey <b>armour</b> was commonplace in ships laid down from 1893–1895. However, its reign was brief; in 1895, the German Kaiser Friedrich III pioneered the superior Krupp <b>armour.</b> Europe adopted Krupp plate within five years, and only the United States persisted in using Harvey steel into the 20th century. The improving quality of <b>armour</b> plate meant that new ships could have better protection from a thinner and lighter <b>armour</b> belt; 12inches (305mm) of compound <b>armour</b> provided the same protection as just 7.5inches (190mm) of Harvey or 5.75inches (133mm) of Krupp.|$|E

5|$|Australias keel {{was laid}} at John Brown & Company's Clydebank yard on 23 June 1910, and was {{assigned}} the yard number 402. The ship was launched by Lady Reid on 25 October 1911, {{in a ceremony}} which received extensive media coverage. Australias design was altered during construction to incorporate improvements in technology, including the newly developed nickel-steel <b>armour</b> plate. While it was intended that the entire ship be fitted with the new <b>armour,</b> manufacturing problems meant that older <b>armour</b> had {{to be used in}} some sections: the delay in sourcing the older <b>armour</b> plates set construction back half a year. Despite this, John Brown & Company delivered the ship £295,000 under budget.|$|E
5|$|Ballard's {{survey found}} no {{underwater}} penetrations of the ship's fully armoured citadel. Eight holes {{were found in}} the hull, one on the starboard side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from Bismarcks port side and struck the starboard anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole. Six holes are amidships, three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main <b>armour</b> belt. Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side <b>armour</b> here, and {{it is likely that the}} shell penetrated the deck <b>armour</b> only. Huge dents showed that many of the 14inch shells fired by King George V bounced off the German belt <b>armour.</b>|$|E

5|$|HMS Glatton {{was derived}} from the design of the first breastwork monitors, but sacrificed the rear turret for thicker <b>armour</b> and larger guns with which to attack enemy ports. She was given a deep draught to improve her seaworthiness, but her low {{freeboard}} meant that she had very little ability to weather head seas. HMS Hotspur was similar in layout to Glatton, but she was given more freeboard by the addition of an unarmoured structure above her waterline <b>armour</b> belt. Designed as a ram, Hotspur was given a fixed turret with four gun ports as a rotating turret was not thought capable of withstanding the shock of impact. HMS Rupert was an enlarged version of Hotspur, but used a Glatton-type turret instead of the fixed turret and thicker <b>armour</b> than the older ship. The two Conqueror-class ships were enlarged versions of Rupert with heavier guns, thicker <b>armour</b> and a steel hull.|$|E
5|$|His {{antiquarian}} interests {{also included}} <b>armour.</b> In 1834 he published A Catalogue of the Collection of Ancient Arms and <b>Armour,</b> {{the property of}} Bernard Brocas, with a prefatory notice. In 1857 Planché was invited to arrange the collection of <b>armour</b> formerly belonging to his friend Sir Samuel Meyrick for the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester, a task which he repeated in South Kensington in 1868. Concerned {{by the state of}} the <b>armour</b> in the Tower of London, Planché wrote several reports on the subject between 1855 and 1869. In that year, the War Office invited him to rearrange the collection in chronological order, {{which was one of the}} things for which he had been campaigning.|$|E

5|$|Maya warriors entered {{battle against}} the Spanish with flint-tipped spears, bows and arrows and stones. They wore padded cotton <b>armour</b> to protect themselves. Members of the Maya {{aristocracy}} wore quilted cotton <b>armour,</b> and some warriors of lesser rank wore twisted rolls of cotton wrapped around their bodies. Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins.|$|E

5|$|Metal <b>armour</b> was {{of limited}} {{use in the}} hot, wet {{tropical}} climate. It was heavy {{and had to be}} constantly cleaned to prevent rusting; in direct sunlight, metal <b>armour</b> became unbearably hot. Conquistadores often went without metal <b>armour,</b> or only donned it immediately prior to battle. They were quick to adopt quilted cotton <b>armour</b> based upon that used by their native opponents, and commonly combined this {{with the use of a}} simple metal war hat. Shields were considered essential by both infantry and cavalry; generally this was a circular target shield, convex in form and fashioned from iron or wood. Rings secured it to the arm and hand.|$|E
5|$|The Z-8 Geier was not produced. It was {{intended}} as a ground attack aircraft and reached the first planning phase but was given up due to lack of performance and protective <b>armour</b> allocation against anti-aircraft artillery.

The middle <b>armour</b> belt had a maximum thickness of 7inches (178mm) over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline <b>armour</b> and thinned to five inches abreast 'A' barbette. The upper belt was 5inches thick amidships and extended forward to 'A' barbette, with a short 4-inch (102mm) extension aft.|$|E
