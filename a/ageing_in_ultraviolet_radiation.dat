500|$|Two {{changes to}} the global {{atmosphere}} due to anthropogenic activity threaten marine mammals. The first is increases <b>in</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> due to ozone depletion, and this mainly affects the Antarctic and {{other areas of the}} southern hemisphere. An increase <b>in</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> has the capacity to decrease phytoplankton abundance, which forms the basis of the food chain in the ocean. The second effect of global climate change is global warming due to increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. [...] Raised sea levels, sea temperature and changed currents are expected to affect marine mammals by altering the distribution of important prey species, and changing the suitability of breeding sites and migratory routes. The Arctic food chain would be disrupted by the near extinction or migration of polar bears. Arctic sea ice is the polar bear's habitat.

40|$|ContextSkin {{cancer is}} a {{preventable}} and commonly diagnosed cancer in the U. S. Excessive <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure is a known cause of skin cancer. This article presents updated results of two types of interventions evaluated in a previously published Community Guide systematic review: multicomponent community-wide (MCCW) interventions and mass media (MM) interventions when used alone. Evidence acquisitionStudies assessing MCCW and MM interventions to prevent skin cancer by reducing <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure were evaluated using Community Guide systematic review methods. Relevant studies published between 1966 and 2013 were included and analyzed for this review. Evidence synthesisSeven studies evaluating the effectiveness of MCCW interventions showed a median increase in sunscreen use of 10. 8 percentage points (interquartile interval= 7. 3, 23. 2); a small decrease <b>in</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure; a decrease in indoor tanning device use of 4. 0 percentage points (95 % CI= 2. 5, 5. 5); and mixed results for other protective behaviors. Four studies evaluating the effectiveness of MM interventions found that they generally led to improved ultraviolet protection behaviors among children and adults. ConclusionsThe available evidence showed that MCCW interventions are effective <b>in</b> reducing <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure by increasing sunscreen use. There was, however, insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of MM interventions alone <b>in</b> reducing <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure, indicating a continuing need for more {{research in this field}} to improve assessment of effectiveness.

40|$|Metallothionein is a multi-functional {{protein that}} protects the host against toxic heavy metals. Under {{stressful}} situations it can protect against oxidative damage, contribute to tissue repair, modulate immune responses and limit inflammatory processes. Recently, metallothionein's role <b>in</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation</b> (UVR) -induced injury has been investigated. These {{studies have shown that}} when metallothionein is upregulated following exposure to UVR, it can protect against UVR-induced damage and the subsequent development of skin cancer. We propose that this initial protection is achieved through its anti-oxidant role resulting in reduced oxidative stress, reduced apoptosis, reduced NF?B activation and enhanced repair of DNA damage. However, once UVR-induced neoplasia has occurred, the cancer cells can hijack metallothionein's protective functions, resulting in increased tumour progression and malignancy. These two discordant sets of attributes are context-dependent, and represent the two faces of metallothionein. 11 page(s...|$|R

Radiochromic film {{is tested}} for its {{broad-band}} response to ultraviolet (UV) B (290 â 320 nm) and A (320 nmâ 400 nm), visible and infrared radiation {{produced by a}} solar simulator and examined for dosimetry <b>in</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>radiation.</b> Results show that MD- 55 - 2 radiochromic film in solar and fluorescent light sources responds almost exclusively to broad-band UVA radiation with negligible colouration from UVB, visible and low level infrared radiation.
