50|$|Application {{delivery}} uses {{one or more}} layer 4-7 switches, {{also known}} as a web switch, content switch, or multilayer switch to intelligently distribute traffic to a pool, {{also known as a}} cluster or farm, of servers. The <b>application</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>controller</b> (ADC) is assigned a single virtual IP address (VIP) that represents the pool of servers. Traffic arriving at the ADC is then directed to one of the servers in the pool (cluster, farm) based on a number of factors including application specific data values, application transport protocol, availability of servers, current performance metrics, and client-specific parameters. An ADN provides the advantages of load distribution, increase in capacity of servers, improved scalability, security, and increased reliability through application specific health checks.|$|E
50|$|An {{application}} delivery network (ADN) is {{a suite of}} technologies that, when deployed together, provide application availability, security, visibility, and acceleration. Gartner defines {{application delivery}} networking as the combination of WAN optimization controllers (WOCs) and application delivery controllers (ADCs). At the data center end of an ADN is the <b>application</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>controller,</b> an advanced traffic management device that is often {{also referred to as}} a web switch, content switch, or multilayer switch, the purpose of which is to distribute traffic among a number of servers or geographically dislocated sites based on application specific criteria. In the branch office portion of an ADN is the WAN optimization controller, which works {{to reduce the number of}} bits that flow over the network using caching and compression, and shapes TCP traffic using prioritization and other optimization techniques. Some WOC components are installed on PCs or mobile clients, and there is typically a portion of the WOC installed in the data center. Application delivery networks are also offered by some CDN vendors.|$|E
