5|$|The {{behaviour}} of the Crusaders appalled the Greeks and Muslims, {{creating a}} lasting barrier between the Latin world <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> Islamic and Orthodox religions. It was {{an obstacle to}} the reunification of the Christian church and created a perception of Westerners as defeated aggressors.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} {{religious}} alarms of renewed Gunpowder Plots. Suspicions rose to panic and collective paranoia on Monday, <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> Trained Bands and the Coldstream Guards focused less on fire fighting {{and more on}} rounding up foreigners, Catholics, and any odd-looking people, arresting them or rescuing them from mobs, or both together.|$|E
5|$|A bone {{unique to}} pterosaurs, {{known as the}} pteroid, {{connected}} to the wrist and helped to support a forward membrane (the propatagium) between the wrist and shoulder. Evidence of webbing between the three free fingers of the pterosaur forelimb suggests that this forward membrane {{may have been more}} extensive than the simple pteroid-to-shoulder connection traditionally depicted in life restorations. The position of the pteroid bone itself has been controversial. Some scientists, notably Matthew Wilkinson, have argued that the pteroid pointed forward, extending the forward membrane. This view was contradicted in a 2007 paper by Chris Bennett, who showed that the pteroid did not articulate as previously thought and could not have pointed forward, but rather inward toward the body as traditionally thought. Peters (2009) proposed that the pteroid articulated with the ‘saddle' of the radiale (proximal syncarpal) <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> pteroid and preaxial carpal were migrated centralia. This view of the articulation of the pteroid has since been supported by specimens of Changchengopterus pani and Darwinopterus linglongtaensis, both of which show the pteroid in articulation with the proximal syncarpal.|$|E

5|$|Abu Bakar {{was noted}} for his {{diplomatic}} skills, <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> British and Malay rulers had approached him for advice in making important decisions. He {{was also an}} avid traveller, {{and became the first}} Malay ruler to travel to Europe during his first visit to England in 1866. In particular, Abu Bakar became a lifetime friend of Queen Victoria in his later years. Abu Bakar's friendship with Queen Victoria {{played an important role in}} shaping Johor's relationships with Britain, and was the only state by the end of the 19th century in the Peninsular Malaya to maintain autonomy in its internal affairs as the British Colonial Government pushed for greater control over the Malay states by placing a British Resident in the states. He was also an Anglophile, and many of his personal habits and decisions were aligned to European ideas and tastes.|$|E
5|$|Alabama {{head coach}} Nick Saban {{was in his}} sixth year as the Crimson Tide's head coach for the 2012 season. During his {{previous}} five years with Alabama, he led the Crimson Tide to an overall record of 50 wins and 12 losses (50–12) <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> 2009 and 2011 national championships. On January 18, 2012, Alabama officially hired Doug Nussmeier from the Washington Huskies as offensive coordinator and Lance Thompson from the Tennessee Volunteers as outside linebackers coach. Nussmeier took the place of Jim McElwain who left to become the head coach at Colorado State, and Thompson took the place of Sal Sunseri who left to become the defensive coordinator at Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|Although Sidney was the {{architect}} of the cemetery, it was superintendent John Boetcher that gave Oakwood its charm. Boetcher became superintendent in 1871 and continued in the position until 1898. At the beginning of his tenure, Oakwood was said to be quite crude. During Boetcher's tenure Oakwood's most important icons were built: the Earl Chapel and Crematorium, the Warren Chapel Mortuary, the keeper's house, the office lodge, numerous mausolea, <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> 101st Street and 114th Street entrances (including a bridge over the Troy and Boston Railroad on Oakwood's western border to the 101st Street entrance). Boetcher incorporated exceptional landscape design techniques during his tenure; Oakwood developed shifting landscape scenery: some areas are dominated by flowing lawns while others comprise dense foliage. Boetcher brought in rare and foreign plants to help beautify the cemetery, including umbrella pines and Colorado blue spruce.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the first}} season {{received}} generally mixed reviews, the second season was highly praised, with some reviewers declaring {{it one of the}} best comedies of the television season. Nevertheless, Parks and Recreation continued to struggle in the Nielsen ratings and averaged about 4.68 million household viewers per week, lower than Thursday night NBC shows Community, 30 Rock, and The Office. Amy Poehler was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> series and actor Nick Offerman received nominations from the Television Critics Association Awards.|$|E
5|$|Among non-living things, snowflakes have {{striking}} sixfold symmetry: each flake's structure {{forming a}} record of the varying conditions during its crystallisation, with nearly the same pattern of growth on each of its six arms. Crystals in general have a variety of symmetries and crystal habits; they can be cubic or octahedral, but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike quasicrystals). Rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non-living things including the crown-shaped splash pattern formed when a drop falls into a pond, <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> spheroidal shape and rings of a planet like Saturn.|$|E

Red-billed choughs have lost ground in most of Europe, and Alpine choughs have lost many breeding sites in the east of the continent.

Throughout the storm's course, the JTWC's intensity estimates were below that of the BoM. Also, it is reported that the cyclone's presentation on satellite was not representative of its actual intensity.|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{two state}} {{elections}} were held, in 1941 and 1944. In the 1941 election, {{there was a}} significant decrease in the independent vote, <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> Labor Party and the LCL made gains, with Playford forming the LCL's first majority government. This was in large part due to the LCL's shift to the right on social issues to usurp the independents' appeal. In 1942, compulsory voting (but not enrolment) was introduced, and first took effect at the 1944 election, with an increase in voter turnout from 51% to 89%. Again Playford won with a one-seat LCL majority, hanging on {{with the help of the}} malapportioned electoral system.|$|E
5|$|Edward's grandson, {{the young}} Richard II, faced {{political}} and economic problems, many resulting from the Black Death, including the Peasants' Revolt that broke out across the south of England in 1381. Over the coming decades, Richard and groups of nobles vied for power and control of policy towards France until Henry of Bolingbroke seized the throne {{with the support of}} parliament in 1399. Ruling as Henry IV, he exercised power through a royal council and parliament, while attempting to enforce political and religious conformity. His son, Henry V, reinvigorated the war with France and came close to achieving strategic success shortly before his death in 1422. Henry VI became king at the age of only nine months <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> English political system and the military situation in France began to unravel.|$|E

5|$|Evra {{is also a}} France {{international}}. Prior {{to playing}} at senior level, he played at under-21 level. He made his senior international debut in August 2004 in a friendly match against Bosnia and Herzegovina. Evra has participated in five major international tournaments for France: the 2008, 2012 and 2016 editions of the UEFA European Championship, winning a runners-up medal at Euro 2016; <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups. Ahead of the 2010 World Cup, Evra was named captain of the national team by manager Raymond Domenech and bore the armband {{for the first time}} in the team's friendly match against Costa Rica in May 2010. At the tournament, he appeared in two group stage matches, although France endured a disastrous campaign which saw the players go on strike after a first round elimination. The incident resulted in Evra, for his role as captain, being suspended from national team duty for five matches. However, he returned to the squad and enjoyed a successful 2014 World Cup in Brazil under Didier Deschamps as France reached the quarter-finals.|$|E

5|$|Griesbach {{agreed with}} Woide and {{expanded}} on Michaelis' point of view. If this manuscript has been corrupted from a version, {{it is more}} reasonable to suspect the Coptic, the version {{of the country in}} which it was written. Between this manuscript <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>the</b> Coptic and Syriac versions there is a remarkable coincidence. According to Griesbach the manuscript follows three different editions: the Byzantine in the Gospels, the Western in the Acts and General epistles, and the Alexandrian in the Pauline epistles. Griesbach designated the codex by letter A.|$|E
