5|$|As {{part of the}} Plan Beersheba reorganisation, {{the unit}} {{has become one of}} three Armoured Cavalry Regiments (ACRs) {{assigned}} to the Army's multirole combat brigades in Brisbane, Darwin and Townsville.

Under the reforms announced in 2011 and confirmed in the 2013 Defence White Paper, the three Regular Army brigades will be restructured between 2014 and 2017 into three Combat Brigades with a similar structure and capabilities, each consisting of: a Brigade Headquarters, an Armoured Cavalry Regiment, two Standard Infantry Battalions, an Artillery Regiment, <b>a</b> <b>Combat</b> Engineer Regiment, <b>a</b> <b>Combat</b> Service Support Battalion and <b>a</b> <b>Combat</b> Signals Regiment. In 2015 it was reported that the Darwin-based elements of the 1st Armoured Regiment may be transferred to South Australia.
