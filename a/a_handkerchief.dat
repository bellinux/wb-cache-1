5|$|One {{man in the}} crowd, Leon Czolgosz, {{hoped to}} assassinate McKinley. He {{had managed to get}} close to the presidential podium, but did not fire, {{uncertain}} of hitting his target. Czolgosz, since hearing a speech by anarchist Emma Goldman in Cleveland, had decided to do something he believed would advance the cause. After his failure to get close enough on the fifth, Czolgosz waited the next day at the Temple of Music on the Exposition grounds, where the President was to meet the public. Czolgosz concealed his gun in <b>a</b> <b>handkerchief,</b> and, when he reached the head of the line, shot McKinley twice in the abdomen.|$|E
5|$|The dagger {{taken from}} Beauchamp at his arrest {{did not match}} the wound on Sharp's body. (In his Confession, Beauchamp claimed to have buried the murder weapon by {{the bank of the}} river near where the murder took place. That knife was never found). Beauchamp's shoe did not match a track found outside Sharp's house the morning of the murder. The posse lost <b>a</b> <b>handkerchief</b> found {{at the scene of the}} crime and {{believed}} to belong to the murderer. (Beauchamp later claimed to have stolen and burned it after the posse had gone to sleep one night).|$|E
5|$|Though Tucker and Maria {{were warned}} against her having more {{children}} in her vulnerable physical and emotional state, she again conceived, and died in pregnancy in February 1823. In the carriage to Washington after the funeral, Tucker muffled his face with <b>a</b> <b>handkerchief</b> to hide his tears and feigned a toothache in response to inquirers. Maria's death indeed weighed heavily upon him, as he reflected on his plausible neglect {{in the midst of}} her travails. He also was much concerned for his son Daniel's indolence and unbalanced behavior which years later would result in the son's hospitalization and ultimate death in 1838 in Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|Goebel {{played a}} role in a famous Ohio State-Illinois game on November 13, 1943. The game was Paul Brown's last game as coach of the Buckeyes. With the score tied 26–26, Ohio State threw an {{incomplete}} forward pass into the end zone as the gun sounded. The game appeared to have ended in a tie, the teams left the field, and the stands emptied. However, Ohio State assistant coach Ernie Godfrey had noticed Goebel, who was the head linesman, drop <b>a</b> <b>handkerchief</b> to signal a penalty. On hearing the gun sound, Goebel had picked up the handkerchief and put it back in his back pocket. Godfrey confronted Goebel, who conceded that Illinois was offsides. Twenty minutes later, the teams came back onto the field and the Buckeyes kicked a 33-yard field goal to give Coach Brown a 29–26 win in his final game.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Quagmire accidentally knocks over {{a carton}} of Kool-Aid mix {{on the kitchen floor}} of the Griffin's house and leaves Peter to take the blame. Frustrated with having to clean Peter's messes, Lois hires a Hispanic maid named Consuela to clean their house. But Consuela quickly proves to be very stubborn, refusing to leave after her work hours and {{sleeping}} at the Griffins' house overnight, much to Peter and Lois' annoyance. They try to fire her and even bribe her to leave, but she still refuses (though she takes the money they offer her anyway). In a last-ditch attempt, Peter finally gets rid of her by tricking her into inhaling chloroform on <b>a</b> <b>handkerchief,</b> and leaves her in a basket on Joe's front porch.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} hit by a {{marksman}} from the Redoutable, firing at a range of 50feet (15m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches (5cm) below his right shoulder blade in the muscles of his back. Nelson was carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, he asked them to pause while he gave some advice to a midshipman on the handling of the tiller. He then draped <b>a</b> <b>handkerchief</b> over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon William Beatty, telling him You can do nothing for me. I have but a short time to live. My back is shot through. Nelson was made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty to remember him to Emma, his daughter and his friends.|$|E

5|$|Lt. Blue and Parrish {{returned}} to Sugar Hollow where Parsons was awaiting them, and Parsons set about locating pine {{from which to}} make torches to light {{their way out of}} the hollow. Parsons carried with him a small hatchet, and began splitting pine in the darkness to fashion a torch. He accidentally struck himself in the knee with his hatchet, and Blue applied <b>a</b> <b>handkerchief</b> to his wound to stop its bleeding. The three men traveled through the dark and rain to the nearby home of Frank Carter, where they ate and dried their clothes by the fire. The following morning, they mounted their horses and traveled to Rev. Harris' home, where Parsons and Blue parted with Parrish. Parsons and Blue continued east over Town Hill and reached George Thompson's residence on the Little Cacapon River, which had risen due to the previous night's rainfall. They remained with Thompson for two days until the river subsided, then traveled to Blue's Gap, where they set up camp. There, Lt. Blue received orders from Col. Angus William McDonald to carry out an expedition for General Stonewall Jackson to ascertain the number of Union Army infantry, cavalry, and artillery present in and around Romney; he was accompanied on this expedition by Col. Parsons' son, Isaac Parsons, Jr., and by W. V. Parsons.|$|E
5|$|The Malagasy on the ship, {{seeing the}} signal fires, cut the anchor cable, {{allowing}} Meermin to drift shorewards, where she grounded on a sandbank. Crew member Rijk Meyer, who had earlier been thrown overboard and swum around {{the ship to}} the safety of the gunroom, now swam from the ship to the shore and was brought to Le Sueur. He informed Le Sueur that the Malagasy on the ship had told him to find out whether the earlier landing party was there, but that he had secretly arranged with the other crew members that, if help was available on shore, he would signal back to the ship by waving <b>a</b> <b>handkerchief</b> above his head. Six Malagasy and another crew member also left Meermin in a canoe, but a unit of the militia immediately surrounded the party when they landed. One Malagasy was shot dead and three others taken prisoner; the dead Malagasy was later identified by one of the ship's crew as the mutiny's overall ringleader, but his name was not recorded. Of the remaining two, one swam away and the other was believed either to have swum back to the ship or drowned in the attempt. Enraged by the crew's deception, the Malagasy still on Meermin launched an attack on the crew which lasted for three hours, but the crew were able to defend themselves.|$|E

25|$|Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy (1582–1591) {{may also}} {{have served as a}} minor influence.
