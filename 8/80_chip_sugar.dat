40|$|Introduction: Nowadays, {{mushroom}} {{and fungi}} {{are one of}} the most promising organisms which are used in biotechnology research (industry, medicine and agriculture). In the meantime, medicinal mushroom (mostly consumed as edible and medicinal products) have become a valuable biological resourcesin the pharmaceutical industry. Ganoderma the most legendary species of fungi in China with a long history dating back more than two thousand years. Ganodermalucidum (Fr.) Karst isa species belonging to the order of Aphyllophorales and family Basidiomycetes. The mushroom only growth on two or three types of trees among 10, 000 known trees in the world and therefore is very rare. Ganoderma fruiting bodies and spores contain about 400 different bioactive compounds, which mainly includeTriterpenes, polysaccharides, nucleotides, sterols, steroids, fatty acids, proteins andpeptides. The mushroom polysaccharides, in addition to cancer treatment have showed antiviral properties, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-hypertensive and prevent blood clotting. Tavana et al (1) in the evaluation of the use of some agricultural and forest wastes material for production of the mushroom stated that the residue are suitable as a helpful supplements for the activity. Gonzalez-Matute et al (11) used sunflower seed shell after oil extraction as a substrate. They concluded that the sunflower seed shell can be used as the main energy source in the substrate to grow the mushroom. There are different agricultural wastematerials which are good sources for growing mushroom in our country. The use of agricultural residues has attracted much attention in recent years. To the best of our knowledge there are a few published studieson the production of Ganoderma in the field condition. This study was performed on Reishi mushroom (Ganodermalucidum) to investigate the effects of different agricultural wastes on some morphological characteristics (growth rate, fresh weight and dry weight of mycelia, biological yield andcrude polysaccharide content) and polysaccharide contents of fruits. Material and Methods:The main portion of the medium for production of Ganodermalucidum was wood chips as 5 - 10 mm long that supplemented with different agricultural wastes included black seed waste, tea waste, hazelnut waste, coconut waste, almond wasteand sesame waste, with two types of bran (wheat and rice). The statistical design was afactorial experiment on the basis of completely randomized design with threereplications. The treatment were included Wood <b>chips</b> (<b>80</b> percent) + black seed waste (10 percent) + rice bran (10 percent) Wood <b>chips</b> (<b>80</b> percent) + tea waste (10 percent) + rice bran (10 percent) Wood <b>chips</b> (<b>80</b> percent) + sesame waste (10 percent) + rice bran (10 percent) Wood <b>chips</b> (<b>80</b> percent) + hazelnut waste (10 percent) + rice bran (10 percent) Wood <b>chips</b> (<b>80</b> percent) + coconut waste (10 percent) + rice bran (10 percent) Wood <b>chips</b> (<b>80</b> percent) + black seed waste (10 percent) + wheat bran (10 percent) Wood <b>chips</b> (<b>80</b> percent) + almond waste (10 percent) + wheat bran (10 percent) Wood <b>chips</b> (<b>80</b> percent) + sesame waste (10 percent) + wheat bran (10 percent) Wood <b>chips</b> (<b>80</b> percent) + hazelnut waste (10 percent) + wheat bran (10 percent) Wood <b>chips</b> (<b>80</b> percent) + coconut waste (10 percent) + wheat bran (10 percent) At first Wood chips soaked in water for 2 days until the their moisture reached 60 - 65 then the other agricultural waste materials added on the basis of the treatments and the autoclavable propylene bags filledwith the mixture and autoclaved for 2 hours at 121 ºC.

After capturing DENV with the sulfated sugar chain-immobilized gold nanoparticles (SGNPs), the resulting complex is precipitated and viral RNA content is measured using the reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction SYBR Green I (RT-qPCR-Syb) method. Sugar chains that bind to DENVs were identified using the array-type <b>sugar</b> chain immobilized <b>chip</b> (<b>Sugar</b> <b>Chip)</b> and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) imaging.

As a result, the novel method was able to detect low concentrations of DENVs using only 6 μL of serum, with similar sensitivity to that of a Qiagen RNA extraction kit using 140 μL of serum. In addition, this method allows for multiplex-like identification of serotypes of DENVs.

In the 80 ’s, the convergence between information technologies and telecommunications opened the way for the Internet, the Web and the Information Society. In the 90 ’s, another very important, but less visible, revolution started with the dissemination of embedded systems technologies. More than 95 % of the chips produced today are for embedded applications. These are electronic components integrating software and hardware jointly and specifically designed to provide given functionalities, which are often critical.

40|$|Driving {{at night}} is a {{difficult}} task. In an attempt to ease this task, most automotive companies are developing systems that aim to increase {{the safety of the}} driver and his/her passengers at night. Jaguar Cars Ltd have been involved in such project for several years and have developed a Night Vision System (NVS) based upon the Near Infrared (NIR) and Head-Up Display (HUD) technologies. This thesis is concerned with the application of digital image enhancement algorithms to further increase the driver's visual range at night. The purpose of this research work is to provide the driver with a safe and non-disturbing, enhanced view of the road scene ahead, which is presented on a head-up display. In this automotive environment, specific requirements such as real-time processing, robustness and reliability must be kept in mind to design algorithms that will not compromise the safety of the driver, his/her passengers and other road users. To fulfill these requirements, we have developed a novel intelligent image enhancement scheme for night time driving that actively adapts to the road scene. This scheme results in the enhancement of the contrast in a portion of the projected HUD road scene as if extra headlamps were directed to the region of the image that represents where the road is going. Human Factors studies have shown that this region is where the driver is concentrating his attention when driving. The position of the region of interest is defined by the computation of an approximation of the vanishing point of the road, updated for every frame using a novel, reliable and optimised road edge detection algorithm. The enhancement of the contrast within the region of interest is obtained by applying several novel low-level algorithms based upon the grey level segmentation of the image into regions {{and the use of the}} global histogram equalisation and quantised bi-histogram equalisation algorithms. These novel algorithms have all been implemented on the Matrox Genesis board based upon the multitasking, multiprocessor and parallel DSP TMS 320 C <b>80</b> <b>chip</b> from Texas Instruments. All algorithms described in this thesis are able to sustain real-time processing at the NTSC frame rate of 30 frames per second.

40|$|The genetic {{diversity}} of African pigs, whether domestic or wild {{has not been}} widely studied and there is very limited published information available. Available data suggests that African domestic pigs originate from different domestication centers as opposed to international commercial breeds. We evaluated two domestic pig populations in Western Kenya, in order to characterize the {{genetic diversity}}, breed composition and admixture of the pigs in an area known to be endemic for African swine fever (ASF). One {{of the reasons for}} characterizing these specific populations is the fact that a proportion of indigenous pigs have tested ASF virus (ASFv) positive but do not present with clinical symptoms of disease indicating some form of tolerance to infection. Pigs were genotyped using either the porcine SNP 60 or SNP <b>80</b> <b>chip.</b> Village pigs were sourced from Busia and Homabay counties in Kenya. Because bush pigs (Potamochoerus larvatus) and warthogs (Phacochoerus spp.) are known to be tolerant to ASFv infection (exhibiting no clinical symptoms despite infection), they were included in the study to assess whether domestic pigs have similar genomic signatures. Additionally, samples representing European wild boar and international commercial breeds were included as references, given their potential contribution to the genetic make-up of the target domestic populations. The data indicate that village pigs in Busia are a non-homogenous admixed population with significant introgression of genes from international commercial breeds. Pigs from Homabay by contrast, represent a homogenous population with a “local indigenous’ composition that is distinct from the international breeds, and clusters more closely with the European wild boar than African wild pigs. Interestingly, village pigs from Busia that tested negative by PCR for ASFv genotype IX, had significantly higher local ancestry (> 54 %) compared to those testing positive, which contained more commercial breed gene introgression. This may have implication for breed selection and utilization in ASF endemic areas. A genome wide scan detected several regions under preferential selection with signatures for pigs from Busia and Homabay being very distinct. Additionally, there was no similarity in specific genes under selection between the wild pigs and domestic pigs despite having some broad areas under similar selection signatures. These results provide a basis to explore possible genetic determinants underlying tolerance to infection by ASFv genotypes and suggests multiple pathways for genetically mediated ASFv tolerance given the diversity of selection signatures observed among the populations studied.

Among the factors, raw materials compositions, mechanical durability, moisture contents, and particle size distribution were studied. Experimental raw materials of different percent weights were introduced to industrial fuel pellet production, micro-chips in part- 1 experiment and peat in part- 2 experiment. Pellets made from these experimental raw material mixtures were tested for their mechanical strength (also known as durability) according to Swedish standards SS 187180 in Part 1 experiment, and European Technical Specification CEN/TS 15210 - 1 in Part 2 Experiment. Moisture contents of these pellets were also determined. In part- 1 experiment, particle size distributions of raw materials and final micro- chips pellets were analyzed. Mapping of pellet production process, bio-energy combine power and heating plant integrated with pellet production were illustrated along with descriptions on major processes. Selected process parameters (i. e. feed rate, drying temperature, milling temperature, pellet machine temperature) for Part 2 experiment were extracted from an industrial program, PGIM signal explorer, and combine with experiment results, thereafter analyzed with statistical methods and by use of SIMCA-P program. The results show that more fresh chips in raw material mixtures give better mechanical strength for micro-chips pellets. For pellets with <b>80</b> % fresh <b>chips</b> and 20 % mature chips in raw materials composition, high durability came from low drying temperature and low feed rate.
