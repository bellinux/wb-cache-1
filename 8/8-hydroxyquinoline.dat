25|$|Transcription inhibitors {{can be used}} as {{antibiotics}} against, for example, pathogenic bacteria (antibacterials) {{and fungi}} (antifungals). An example of such an antibacterial is rifampicin, which inhibits Bacterial transcription of DNA into mRNA by inhibiting DNA-dependent RNA polymerase by binding its beta-subunit. <b>8-Hydroxyquinoline</b> is an antifungal transcription inhibitor. The effects of histone methylation may also work to inhibit the action of transcription.|$|E

50|$|The {{roots of}} the {{invasive}} plant Centaurea diffusa release <b>8-hydroxyquinoline,</b> which has {{a negative effect on}} plants that have not co-evolved with it.|$|E
50|$|Related ligands {{include the}} Schiff bases derived from {{salicylaldehyde}}, such as salicylaldoxime, salen, and salicylaldehyde isonicotinoylhydrazone (SIH). 8-Mercaptoquinoline is the thiol analogue of <b>8-hydroxyquinoline.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... <b>8-Hydroxyquinoline</b> {{has been}} {{identified}} as a main allelopathic compound produced by diffuse knapweed (C. diffusa); native North American plants are typically sensitive to it, while those of Eastern Europe and Asia Minor usually have coevolved with the knapweed and are little harmed if at all, aided by native microorganisms that break down or even feed on the abundantly secreted compound. Thus, <b>8-hydroxyquinoline</b> is potentially useful to control American plants that have become invasive weeds in the diffuse knapweed's native range.|$|E
50|$|PBT2 is an {{experimental}} drug candidate. It is a second-generation <b>8-hydroxyquinoline</b> analog {{intended to be}} a successor to clioquinol and a potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease and Huntington disease.|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} of <b>8-hydroxyquinoline</b> with aluminium(III) results in Alq3, a common component of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Variations in the substituents on the quinoline rings affect its luminescence properties.|$|E
50|$|Tris(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminium is the {{chemical}} compound with the formula Al(C9H6NO)3. Widely abbreviated Alq3, it is a coordination complex wherein aluminium is bonded in a bidentate manner to the conjugate base of three <b>8-hydroxyquinoline</b> ligands.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>8-Hydroxyquinoline</b> is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula C9H7NO. It is a derivative of the heterocycle quinoline by placement of an OH group on carbon number 8. This light yellow compound {{is widely used}} commercially, although {{under a variety of}} names.|$|E
50|$|Copper sulfate {{mixed with}} lime {{is used as}} a {{fungicide}} and antihelminthic. Copper sulfate is used chiefly to destroy green algae (algicide) that grow in reservoirs, stock ponds, swimming pools, and fish tanks. Copper <b>8-hydroxyquinoline</b> is sometimes included in paint to prevent mildew.|$|E
5000|$|... 8-Mercaptoquinoline is the {{organosulfur}} compound {{with the}} formula C9H7NSH. It is a derivative of the heterocycle quinoline, substituted in the 8-position with a thiol group.

50|$|SDB-005 is an indazole-based {{synthetic}} cannabinoid {{that has}} been sold online as a designer drug. It is presumed to be an agonist of the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors. SDB-005 is the indazole core analogue of PB-22 where the <b>8-hydroxyquinoline</b> has also been replaced with a naphthalene group.|$|E
50|$|Grapevine trunk {{diseases}} (GTD) are {{the most}} destructive diseases of vineyards worldwide. Fungicides (such as sodium arsenite or <b>8-hydroxyquinoline,</b> used to fight esca) {{with the potential to}} control GTD have been banned in Europe and there are no highly effective treatments available. Action to develop new strategies to fight these diseases are needed.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>8-Hydroxyquinoline</b> is a monoprotic bidentate {{chelating}} agent. In neutral solution, the hydroxyl {{is in the}} {{protonated form}} (pKa=9.89) and the nitrogen is not protonated (pKa=5.13). However, transient, photochemically induced excited-state zwitterionic isomer exists in which H+ is transferred from the oxygen (giving an oxygen anion) to the nitrogen (giving a protonated nitrogen cation).|$|E

50|$|Preservation of {{the results}} is done with {{black-and-white}} and color photography. Use of a shortwave ultraviolet filter over the camera flash {{can be used to}} record the results, although a steady source of UV is preferred. In either case a darkened area is needed for screening purposes. Another reagent, 0.5 percent 2-nitroso-1-naphthol in acetone, eliminated the need for a UV light but is limited to a four-hour-window versus the forty-eight for <b>8-hydroxyquinoline.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Quinoline {{is mainly}} {{used as a}} {{feedstock}} {{in the production of}} other specialty chemicals. Approximately 4 tonnes are produced annually according to a report published in 2005. [...] Its principal use is as a precursor to <b>8-hydroxyquinoline,</b> which is a versatile chelating agent and precursor to pesticides. Its 2- and 4-methyl derivatives are precursors to cyanine dyes. Oxidation of quinoline affords quinolinic acid (pyridine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid), a precursor to the herbicide sold under the name [...] "Assert".|$|E
50|$|Another {{examples}} are Centaurea solstitialis (yellow starthistle) and Centaurea diffusa (diffuse knapweed). These Eastern European noxious weeds have {{spread through the}} western and West Coast states. Experiments show that <b>8-hydroxyquinoline,</b> a chemical produced {{at the root of}} C. diffusa, has a negative effect only on plants that have not co-evolved with it. Such co-evolved native plants have also evolved defenses. C. diffusa and C. solstitialis do not appear in their native habitats to be overwhelmingly successful competitors. Success or lack of success in one habitat does not necessarily imply success in others. Conversely, examining habitats in which a species is less successful can reveal novel weapons to defeat invasiveness.|$|E
5000|$|The {{chelating}} {{activities of}} nitroxoline {{have also been}} used in an anticancer setting. Nitroxoline {{has been shown to}} be more cytotoxic to HL60, DHL-4, Panc-1, and A2780 cells lines than clioquinol and other <b>8-hydroxyquinoline</b> derivatives. [...] It also demonstrated an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production over controls, especially when Cu2+ was added. The ROS levels reached over 350% of the controls with addition of CuCl2. Interestingly, the cytotoxicity production was markedly decreased with addition of ZnCl2, indicating, based on this model, that nitroxoline is not a zinc chelator. Because the zinc chelating action of clioquinol has been associated with subacute myelo-optic neuropathy, the use of nitroxoline as a cytotoxic drug in the treatment of cancers should not exhibit neurotoxic effects in humans, and in vivo trials on tumour xenografts in mice have not yielded any negative neurodegenerative effects.|$|E
50|$|The Trace Metal Detection Test (TMDT) or Technique was {{developed}} during the Vietnam War in the 1960s to identify {{people who may have}} been carrying firearms against their skin. A 0.2% solution of <b>8-hydroxyquinoline</b> in isopropanol sprayed on the skin and illuminated with shortwave ultraviolet (UV) light after several minutes reveals a pattern and type of metal based on trace amounts of metal transferred to the skin that are invisible under normal lighting. The technique was later adopted by police in the United States to help determine if a person had carried a firearm. In a California crime an automatic handgun carried in the waistband of a criminal reportedly produced an impression of the weapon's serial number. Presence and persistence of a detectable residue depends primarily on the amount of perspiration, length of contact, and time since exposure. A few minutes of exposure can leave detectable residue and the result can remain for up to forty-eight hours.|$|E
