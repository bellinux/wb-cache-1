40|$|Abstract — The {{earliest}} form of {{a manual}} transmission {{is thought to have}} been invented by Louis-René Panhard and Emile Levassor in the late 19 th century. This type of transmission offered multiple gear ratios and, in most cases, reverses. Almost all automobiles as of today are driven by internal combustion engines because of the high power to weight ratio, relatively good efûciency and compact energy storage associated with it. The major disadvantage with this engine is it’s incapability of producing torque from the rest, which is the characteristic of ideal traction hyperbola. This difference between characteristics curve of the combustion engine and the ideal traction hyperbola can be approximated by the use of a gear box. In this paper a gear box with 7 forward gears and 2 reverse gears has been described. A normal 7 speed MT requires <b>8</b> <b>gear</b> pairs to provide 7 forward and 1 reverse gear but this paper presents a novel 7 speed MT designed with just 6 gear pairs giving 7 forward and 2 reverse gears thereby saving both the material cost as well as meeting the space constraints...|$|E

This meant <b>8</b> forward <b>gears</b> in total. It was also possible to use the 2 speed selector in reverse, meaning that two reverse gears also existed. In the majority of cars, the 2 speed selector was labelled as 'Power' for the lower range, and 'Economy' for the higher range.

These are caused {{by a combination of}} geometric errors and variable elastic mesh deections. The forces are transmitted through the bearings to the gearbox structure, and so either generate airborne noise or lead to excitation of other structures. In this investigation of gear noise, the dynamic forces excited at the bearing at tooth contact frequency (TCF) are considered as the ‘noise parameter’. This has been used to compare gears of differing geometry at varying load and speed conditions.

40|$|Abstract. This paper aims at {{improving}} {{the design of}} torque sensor used in the EPS system. Such design not only integrates the torque and the corner signal, but also saves space. By using Matlab interior point method, the gear system parameters are optimized andthe weight {{and the size of}} the sensor are reduced. Bench test results demonstrate that the measurement accuracy of this self-designed sensor is able to meet the demands of EPS. 1. Design of the torque and angle sensor gear set The structural design of sensor gear is shown in fig 1 [1]. We define gear 1 and gear 2 to have the same number of gear teeth; the duplex gears 3, 4, and 5 to have the same number of gear teeth; gear 6, 7 with the same amount of gear teeth. <b>Gear</b> 1, 6, <b>8</b> and double <b>gear</b> 3 hence become the main concerns in parameter design. The transmission ratio is respectively: Z 1 =Z 2 = 84 ；Z' 3 =Z’ 4 =Z’ 5 = 15 ；Z 3 =Z 4 =Z 5 = 45 ；Z 6 =Z 7 = 35 ；Z 8 = 36 (1) In Eqs. 1, Z’ 3 refers to the teeth number of the medium-small-sized duplex gear. Z 3 refers to the teeth number of the medium-large-sized duplex gear.

If the steering wheel’s rotation angle is, then the angle difference between gear 6 and <b>gear</b> <b>8</b> is, thus the steering wheel’s rotation angle corresponds with the angle difference of the pinions. Therefore, the measurement of the steering wheel’s rotation angle can be converted into the measurement of the angle difference between the two pinions.

The cornering characteristics investigated included side and drag forces and friction coefficients, aligning and overturning torques, friction force moment arm, and the lateral center of pressure shift. Results of this investigation indicate that the cornering characteristics of the space shuttle nose gear tire are insensitive to variations in ground speed over the range tested.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} the duration and annual rate of menopause-related bone loss and to investigate the relationship between bone turnover and bone loss in early healthy postmenopausal women. The rate of change in bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine and in bone turnover was measured twice at the exact interval of 12 months by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and bay the determination of plasma alkaline phosphatase levels (ALP) and fasting urinary hydroxyproline/creatinine ratio (OHPr/Cr), respectively, in 123 healthy premenopausal and postmenopausal women 45 - 60 years of age. The subjects Ir ere divided into nine groups according to their menstrual status and gears since menopause (YSM). Annual bone loss at the lumbar spine of women tr ho were menopausal for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years was - 2. 62 +/- 0. 37 (95 % confidence interval - 3. 66, - 1. 58), - 3. 87 +/- 0. 96 (- 6. 02, - 1. 73), - 2. 50 +/- 0. 37 (- 3. 29, - 1. 70), - 2. 86 +/- 0. 73 (- 4. 44, - 1. 27), and - 1. 54 +/- 0. 41 (- 2. 42, - 0. 66), respectively, and was significantly less than zero.

These results demonstrate that the early hormone-dependent bone loss commences in the first year after menopause and is arrested within 6 years after the onset of menopause. The overall bone loss for this phase is estimated to be approximately 15 %. Annual change in ALP and OHPr/Cr seems to indicate that bone resorption prevails on bone formation in the first 2 YSM, whereas osteoblastic activity relatively prevails from YSM 3 to YSM 5, which explains the progressive repairing of the imbalance between bone resorption and formation.

It may not be feasible to use these distinct ratios in strict low-high sequence anyway due to the complicated shifting patterns involved (e.g. simultaneous double or triple shift on the rear derailleur and a single shift on the front derailleur).
