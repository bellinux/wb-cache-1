We measure the total encoding time of BL and EL to reveal the speed of encoder. The average encoding time saving (ATS, %) is used to measure the reduction on encoding complexity, which is the average of time savings (TS) for various QPs. These parameters are important to compare the proposed fast approach with the reference software and the state-of-the-art fast algorithm. The results are obtained for various sequences.|$|R
30|$|Although {{when the}} {{look-ahead}} step becomes larger, LSH {{is not as}} accurate as SOM, it has great advantage in terms of computation load. All simulation studies are run on a Windows 7 PC with an Inter Core i 7 CPU 3.40 GHz and <b>8</b> <b>GB</b> <b>memory,</b> and the program is coded in MATLAB 2014 a. Take the case of forecasting 4 look-ahead steps using the December data of the Elia data set for example. The computation time of SSA-K-means-SVR, SSA-SOM-SVR and SSA-LSH-SVR is 6.7798, 57.7116 and 1.0396 seconds, respectively. Therefore, LSH is a better choice as it sacrifices little accuracy (the largest difference is 0.46 % for NMAE) with huge savings in time.|$|R
