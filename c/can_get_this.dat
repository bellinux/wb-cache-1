500|$|Most of Gould's {{empirical}} research pertained to land snails. He focused his early {{work on the}} Bermudian genus Poecilozonites, while his later work concentrated on the West Indian genus Cerion. According to Gould [...] "Cerion is the land snail of maximal diversity in form throughout the entire world. There are 600 described species of this single genus. In fact, they're not really species, they all interbreed, but the names exist to express a real phenomenon which is this incredible morphological diversity. Some are shaped like golf balls, some are shaped like pencils. ... Now my main subject is the evolution of form, {{and the problem of}} how it is that you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> diversity amid so little genetic difference, so far as we can tell, is a very interesting one. And if we could solve this we'd learn something general about the evolution of form." ...|$|E

5000|$|Feasibility is “the {{state or}} degree of being easily or {{conveniently}} done”. More plainly, {{one might ask}} “can we <b>get</b> <b>this</b> done?” Feasibility, {{as it pertains to}} the political arena, speaks to the political climate.

"That stream outside," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "must run in here somewhere, {{although}} I cannot see nor hear it, {{and it must}} be stopped off by this valve or another one connected with it, so that if I <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> lever up again, I should shut it off from the stream outside and turn it in here. Then, if that fellow comes back, he will have to swim to the mound, and run a good chance of getting drowned if he does it, and if anybody else comes here, I think it will be as safe as the ancient Peruvians once made it." ...|$|E

What {{do you want}} {{more than anything else}}? What--is needed absolutely? What is indispensable to you? Why, if I may, be allowed to answer the question, it is to retain a hold upon the North, it is to retain support and strength from the free States. If you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> support and strength from the free States, you can succeed.

Now I wish to relieve my passengers from the confinement this will occasion, and I have ordered the boatswain to pitch a tent for them on the largest of these here Tortugas; and what I want of you, is to muster food and water, and other women's knicknacks, and go ashore with them, and make them as comfortable as you can for a few days, or until we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> schooner loaded and off." ...|$|E

30|$|According to the mathematic {{properties}} of the exp-function, we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> that <b>this</b> reward function is a monotone decreasing function.
