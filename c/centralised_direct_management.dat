40|$|Throughout western Europe, {{beginning}} about 1200, leasing of lords' estates {{became more}} common relative to <b>direct</b> <b>management.</b> In England, however, <b>direct</b> <b>management</b> increased beginning {{around the same}} time and until the fourteenth century, and leasing increased thereafter. This article models contract choice as a trade-off between incentives and insurance. Leasing increases as living standards improve. In England, the increase in <b>direct</b> <b>management</b> can be explained by improved security of freehold tenure, and the increase in leasing can be explained not only by living standards but also by improved security of leasehold tenure.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the main}} difficulties and advances within a process of <b>direct</b> <b>management</b> of a public forest. Particularly, the paper examines the <b>direct</b> <b>management</b> of Antimary Public Forest in Acre State. The paper focuses on the factors that contributed to forest management, natural resources conservation and local community development within the conservation unit. Methodologically, the research was based on case study, qualitative analysis and historical-descriptive method for data assessment. For data collection it was used participant observation, semi-structured interviews, documentary analysis and geo-processing tools.

The pattern of forest reserve <b>direct</b> <b>management</b> when applied in small conservation units may increase the possibilities of political intervention of the State and the communities in the unit management, as well as contribute to the reduction of deforestation and conflicts about use of resources...|$|R

40|$|Birds {{and other}} {{wildlife}} are a serious problem at U. S. airports. Wildlife strikes cost U. S. civil aviation over $ 300 million per year, {{based on data from}} 1990 - 1998, and the number of reported bird strikes to civil aircraft has increased over 104 % during that same time period. The increase in aircraft striking wildlife {{is due in part to}} the significant increase of various wildlife populations during the past 30 years. The United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Wildlife Services (WS) program provides Federal assistance to airports in addressing wildlife hazards to aircraft. To comply with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), WS measured the percent risk reduction achieved by their airport/human safety protection programs.

For FY 1999, <b>direct</b> <b>management</b> assistance was performed by WS at 110 airports while technical assistance was provided at 316 airports.
