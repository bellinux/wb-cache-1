5|$|The Annunciation was {{a popular}} theme in European art, {{although}} a difficult scene to paint, because it depicts Mary's union with Christ as she becomes the tabernacle for the Word made flesh. Mary as Theotokos, the God-bearer, was affirmed in 431 at the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> Ephesus; two decades later the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> Chalcedon affirmed the doctrine of Incarnation– that Christ was of two natures (God and Man)– and her perpetual virginity was affirmed at the Lateran <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> 631. In Byzantine art, Annunciation scenes depict the Virgin enthroned and dressed in royal regalia. In later centuries she was shown in enclosed spaces: the temple, the church, the garden.|$|E
