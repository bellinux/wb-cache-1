5|$|Most {{important}} was French {{reaction to the}} attack. Gaddafi had possibly believed that, due to the upcoming French legislative elections, Mitterrand would be reluctant {{to start a new}} risky and costly expedition to save Habré; this evaluation proved wrong, as what the French President could not politically risk was to show weakness towards Libyan aggression. As a result, on 14 February Opération Epervier was started, bringing 1,200 French troops and several squadrons of Jaguars to Chad. On 16 February, to send a <b>clear</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> Gaddafi, the French Air Force bombed Libya's Ouadi Doum airbase. Libya retaliated the next day when a Libyan Tu-22 bombed the N'Djamena Airport, causing minimal damage.|$|E

NATO's goals were to contain Soviet expansion in Europe and to send a <b>clear</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> communist leaders that the world's democracies were willing and able to build new security structures in support of democratic ideals. The U.S., Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Iceland, and Canada were the original treaty signatories.

25|$|Eleven {{environmental}} organizations condemned the logging in March and later identified the withholding of international aid {{due to the}} political crisis {{as one of the}} most significant problems fueling these illegal activities. In particular, frozen funds from World Bank and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) support capacity building for the national parks, the implementation of chain of custody and tracking for logging, and general funding of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MEF). In all 70% of the government's operating budget was funded by foreign aid prior to the political turmoil. Since the funding was cut, the government has been strangled by a severe lack of funds, leaving the MEF, for instance, restricted to 10% of its normal budget. Despite pleas from conservation organizations, aid agencies have stood firm on the withholding of aid, arguing that it is the only way send a <b>clear</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> the current government that their actions are illegal and disruptive to business relations as well as to pressure them into holding new elections.|$|E
25|$|Under {{pressure}} from the Reichswehr (German armed forces) leadership (whose members viewed the enormous {{armed forces of the}} SA as an existential threat) and with the collusion of Göring, Joseph Goebbels, the Gestapo and SD, Hitler was led to believe that Roehm's SA posed a serious conspiratorial threat requiring a drastic and immediate solution. For its part, the SD provided fictitious information that there was an assassination plot on Hitler's life and that an SA putsch to assume power was imminent since the SA were allegedly amassing weapons. Additionally, reports were coming in to the SD and Gestapo that the vulgarity of the SA's behavior was damaging the party and was even making antisemitism less palatable. On 30 June 1934 the SS and Gestapo acted in coordinated mass arrests that continued for two days. The SS took one of its most decisive steps in eliminating its competition for command of security within Germany and established itself firmly in the Nazi hierarchy, making the SS and its intelligence organ, the SD, responsible only to the Führer. The purge became known as the Night of the Long Knives, with up to 200 people killed in the action. Moreover, the brutal crushing of the SA and its leadership sent a <b>clear</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> everyone that opposition to Hitler's regime could be fatal. It struck fear across the Nazi leadership as to the tangible concern of the reach and influence of Himmler's intelligence collection and policing powers.|$|E

A range of social and mental health intervention strategies and principles seem, however, to have the broad support of expert opinion. Despite continuing debate, there is emerging agreement on what entails good public health practice in respect of mental health. In terms of early interventions, this agreement is exemplified by the recent inclusion of a "mental and social aspects of health" standard in the Sphere handbook's revision on minimal standards in disaster response.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to review the {{literature}} related to fathers of people who have an intellectual disability. Electronic databases and citation tracking were used to collate data using key terms such as fathers, adults with an intellectual disability, learning disability, mental handicap and developmental disability. Relevant articles were analysed and compared for commonality and difference. Eight themes emerged from the literature: response to diagnosis; varied response to intellectual disability; concern for the future; work; roles and relationships; impact of fathers upon child development; fathers and service providers; fathers’ needs and coping strategies. This review of the literature presents areas of similarity and divergence, and highlights the lack of information that relates specifically to fathers of adults. There are <b>clear</b> <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> service providers to support the inclusion of fathers and the need for further research in this area is indicated...|$|R
500|$|The Night of the Long Knives {{represented}} a triumph for Hitler, and {{a turning point}} for the German government. It established Hitler as [...] "the supreme leader of the German people", as he put it in his July 13 speech to the Reichstag. Later, in April 1942, Hitler would formally adopt this title, thus placing himself de jure as well as de facto above the reach of the law. Centuries of jurisprudence proscribing extrajudicial killings were swept aside. Despite some initial efforts by local prosecutors to take legal action against those who carried out the murders, which the regime rapidly quashed, it appeared that no law would constrain Hitler in his use of power. The Night of the Long Knives also sent a <b>clear</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> the public that even the most prominent Germans were not immune from arrest or even summary execution should the Nazi regime perceive them as a threat. In this manner, the purge established a pattern of violence that would characterise the Nazi regime.|$|E
500|$|Once the F-111 {{had been}} ordered, Hancock sought a {{suitable}} forward airfield {{from which they}} could operate. In this, he continued a policy initiated by his predecessor as CAS, Air Marshal Scherger, of developing a chain of so-called [...] "bare bases" [...] in Northern Australia. Hancock recommended redeveloping RAAF Base Learmonth {{in the northern part}} of Western Australia, due to its proximity to Indonesia. Flying out of this airfield, the F-111s could destroy [...] "vital centres in Java"; just as importantly for deterrence purposes, Hancock contended, enhancing the base's capability would send a <b>clear</b> <b>message</b> <b>to</b> Indonesia's hierarchy. Though the project was delayed, in part due to thawing in relations between Australia and Indonesia, Learmonth's upgrade was completed in 1973, the same year that the F-111 finally entered RAAF service. The latter part of Hancock's tour as CAS coincided with the beginning of large-scale Australian involvement in the Vietnam War. By mid-1964, the Commonwealth had already sent a small team of military advisors, plus a detachment of newly acquired DHC-4 Caribou cargo planes, to the region at the request of the South Vietnamese government. Under Hancock, the Caribou had itself only been reluctantly ordered by the Air Force following intense pressure from the Army and the Federal government for an STOL transport. Concerned at the potential drain on the RAAF's resources, Hancock tried to resist calls for commitments to Vietnam. His negative views were in contrast to the hawkish attitudes of his deputy, Air Vice Marshal Colin Hannah, and Air Chief Marshal Scherger, now Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee and Australia's senior soldier. In April 1965, as part of American operations in Indochina, United States Air Force strike aircraft took up residence at Ubon Air Force Base, Thailand, which since 1962 had been home to No.79 Squadron Sabres and run by the RAAF under SEATO arrangements. Hancock proposed that Australia continue to command the facility and provide local air defence, though this effectively made the Sabres a support unit in the war effort and therefore potential targets of North Vietnamese attack; in the event, none occurred.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOperational {{real time}} flood {{forecasting}} systems generally require a hydrological model {{to run in}} real {{time as well as}} a series of hydro-informatics tools to transform the flood forecast into relatively simple and <b>clear</b> <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> the decision makers involved in flood defense. The scope {{of this paper is to}} set forth the possibility of providing flood warnings at given river sections based on the direct comparison of the quantitative precipitation forecast with critical rainfall threshold values, without the need of an on-line real time forecasting system. This approach leads to an extremely simplified alert system to be used by non technical stakeholders and could also be used to supplement the traditional flood forecasting systems in case of system failures. The critical rainfall threshold values, incorporating the soil moisture initial conditions, result from statistical analyses using long hydrological time series combined with a Bayesian utility function minimization. In the paper, results of an application of the proposed methodology to the Sieve river, a tributary of the Arno river in Italy, are given to exemplify its practical applicability...|$|R
40|$|Early {{childhood}} contexts often enact “common-sense identities” {{that create}} and sustain {{the notion that}} teachers of young children are expressly female and heterosexual. It has also been argued that touch is a key difference {{between men and women}} in early childhood classrooms. This exploratory study examined 10 early childhood textbooks to determine whether images depicting touch enacted these common-sense notions. To investigate whether implicit gendered messages existed within the texts, images displaying touch between teachers and children were grouped according to three main recurrent themes: teacher touching child, child touching teacher, and mutually negotiated contact. Findings indicated that, although the images of male teachers were positive, troubling patterns did emerge concerning the type and nature of men’s contact with children. These patterns worked to reaffirm larger patriarchal structures at play in schools and society while simultaneously painting women as more suitable to nurture young children. Furthermore, the texts provided <b>clear</b> <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> beginning teachers that acceptable types of touch were delineated by gender. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for early childhood preservice teacher education...|$|R
