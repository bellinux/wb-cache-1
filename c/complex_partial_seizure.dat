50|$|Focal {{seizures}} (previously called partial seizures) {{are divided}} into simple partial or <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizure.</b> Current practice no longer recommends this, and instead prefers to describe what occurs during a seizure.|$|E
50|$|In simple focal {{seizures}} a {{small part}} of one of the lobes may be affected and the person remains conscious. This will often be a precursor to a larger seizure such as a <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizure.</b> When this is the case, the simple partial seizure is usually called an aura.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizures</b> {{might arise}} from any lobe of the brain. [...] <b>Complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizures</b> most {{commonly}} {{arise from the}} mesial temporal lobe, particularly the amygdala, hippocampus, and neocortical regions. [...] A common associated brain abnormality is mesial temporal sclerosis. [...] Mesial temporal sclerosis is a specific pattern of hippocampal neuronal loss accompanied by hippocampal gliosis and atrophy. [...] <b>Complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizures</b> occur when excessive and synchronous electrical brain activity causes impaired awareness and responsiveness. [...] The abnormal electrical activity might spread {{to the rest of}} the brain and cause a secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizure.|$|R
50|$|Because a major {{function}} of the temporal lobe is short-term memory, <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizures</b> and generalised tonic clonic seizures may cause amnesia {{for the period of}} the seizure. As a result, patients with temporal lobe <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizures</b> and generalised tonic clonic seizures may not remember having had a seizure.|$|R
50|$|Partial {{seizures}} may {{be further}} subdivided into both simple and complex seizures. This {{refers to the}} effect of such a seizure on consciousness; simple seizures cause no interruption to consciousness (although they may cause sensory distortions or other sensations), whereas complex seizures interrupt consciousness to varying degrees. This {{does not necessarily mean that}} the person experiencing this sort of seizure will lose consciousness (like fainting). For example, a <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizure</b> may involve the unconscious repetition of simple actions, gestures or verbal utterances, or simply a blank stare and apparent unawareness of the occurrence of the seizure, followed by no memory of the seizure. Other patients may report a feeling of tunnel vision or dissociation, which represents a diminishment of awareness without full loss of consciousness. Still other patients can perform complicated actions, such as travel or shopping, while in the midst of a <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizure.</b>|$|E
50|$|Simple focal {{seizures}} are seizures which affect {{only a small}} {{region of}} the brain, often the temporal lobes or hippocampi. People who have simple partial seizures retain consciousness. Simple partial seizures often precede larger seizures, where the abnormal electrical activity spreads to a larger area of (or all of) the brain, usually resulting in a <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizure</b> or a tonic-clonic seizure.|$|E
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of generalized seizures are idiopathic. However, some generalized seizures start as a smaller seizure such as a simple partial seizure or a <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizure</b> and then spread to both hemispheres of the brain. This is called a secondary generalization. Factors could include chemical and neurotransmitter imbalances and a genetically determined seizure threshold, {{both of which have}} been implicated. The seizure threshold can be altered by fatigue, malnutrition, lack of sleep or rest, hypertension, stress, diabetes, the presence of neon or xenon strobe-flashes, fluorescent lighting, rapid motion or flight,blood sugar imbalances, anxiety, antihistamines and other factors.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT – Postictal {{phenomena}} such as nose-wiping, {{coughing and}} hyper-salivation {{are believed to}} reflect a purposeful reaction to hypersecretion after regaining consciousness following a <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizure,</b> and are very common in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, particularly in mesial tempo-ral lobe epilepsy.

40|$|Elizabeth J Waterhouse, Kimberly N Mims, Soundarya N GowdaDepartment of Neurology, Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, Richmond, VA, USAAbstract: Vigabatrin (VGB) is an {{antiepileptic}} {{drug that}} was designed to inhibit GABA-transaminase, and increase levels of &gamma;-amino-butyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. VGB has demonstrated efficacy as an adjunctive antiepileptic drug for refractory <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizures</b> (CPS) and for infantile spasms (IS). This review focuses on its use for <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizures.</b> Although VGB is well tolerated, there have been significant safety concerns about intramyelinic edema and visual field defects. VGB is associated with a risk of developing bilateral concentric visual field defects. Therefore, the use of VGB for <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizures</b> should be limited to those patients with seizures refractory to other treatments.

40|$|Thirty {{children}} (20 males, 10 females) with intractable epilepsy received vigabatrin (VGB) as an open label {{basis to}} preexisting antiepileptic drugs.
