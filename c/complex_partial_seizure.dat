50|$|Focal {{seizures}} (previously called partial seizures) {{are divided}} into simple partial or <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizure.</b> Current practice no longer recommends this, and instead prefers to describe what occurs during a seizure.|$|E
50|$|In simple focal {{seizures}} a {{small part}} of one of the lobes may be affected and the person remains conscious. This will often be a precursor to a larger seizure such as a <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizure.</b> When this is the case, the simple partial seizure is usually called an aura.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizures</b> {{might arise}} from any lobe of the brain. [...] <b>Complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizures</b> most {{commonly}} {{arise from the}} mesial temporal lobe, particularly the amygdala, hippocampus, and neocortical regions. [...] A common associated brain abnormality is mesial temporal sclerosis. [...] Mesial temporal sclerosis is a specific pattern of hippocampal neuronal loss accompanied by hippocampal gliosis and atrophy. [...] <b>Complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizures</b> occur when excessive and synchronous electrical brain activity causes impaired awareness and responsiveness. [...] The abnormal electrical activity might spread {{to the rest of}} the brain and cause a secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizure.|$|R
50|$|Because a major {{function}} of the temporal lobe is short-term memory, <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizures</b> and generalised tonic clonic seizures may cause amnesia {{for the period of}} the seizure. As a result, patients with temporal lobe <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizures</b> and generalised tonic clonic seizures may not remember having had a seizure.|$|R
50|$|Partial {{seizures}} may {{be further}} subdivided into both simple and complex seizures. This {{refers to the}} effect of such a seizure on consciousness; simple seizures cause no interruption to consciousness (although they may cause sensory distortions or other sensations), whereas complex seizures interrupt consciousness to varying degrees. This {{does not necessarily mean that}} the person experiencing this sort of seizure will lose consciousness (like fainting). For example, a <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizure</b> may involve the unconscious repetition of simple actions, gestures or verbal utterances, or simply a blank stare and apparent unawareness of the occurrence of the seizure, followed by no memory of the seizure. Other patients may report a feeling of tunnel vision or dissociation, which represents a diminishment of awareness without full loss of consciousness. Still other patients can perform complicated actions, such as travel or shopping, while in the midst of a <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizure.</b>|$|E
50|$|Simple focal {{seizures}} are seizures which affect {{only a small}} {{region of}} the brain, often the temporal lobes or hippocampi. People who have simple partial seizures retain consciousness. Simple partial seizures often precede larger seizures, where the abnormal electrical activity spreads to a larger area of (or all of) the brain, usually resulting in a <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizure</b> or a tonic-clonic seizure.|$|E
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of generalized seizures are idiopathic. However, some generalized seizures start as a smaller seizure such as a simple partial seizure or a <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizure</b> and then spread to both hemispheres of the brain. This is called a secondary generalization. Factors could include chemical and neurotransmitter imbalances and a genetically determined seizure threshold, {{both of which have}} been implicated. The seizure threshold can be altered by fatigue, malnutrition, lack of sleep or rest, hypertension, stress, diabetes, the presence of neon or xenon strobe-flashes, fluorescent lighting, rapid motion or flight,blood sugar imbalances, anxiety, antihistamines and other factors.|$|E

VGB has demonstrated efficacy as an adjunctive antiepileptic drug for refractory <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizures</b> (CPS) and for infantile spasms (IS). This review focuses on its use for <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizures.</b> Although VGB is well tolerated, there have been significant safety concerns about intramyelinic edema and visual field defects. VGB is associated with a risk of developing bilateral concentric visual field defects. Therefore, the use of VGB for <b>complex</b> <b>partial</b> <b>seizures</b> should be limited to those patients with seizures refractory to other treatments.

40|$|Thirty {{children}} (20 males, 10 females) with intractable epilepsy received vigabatrin (VGB) as an open label {{basis to}} preexisting antiepileptic drugs.

The {{cause of the}} epilepsy was cryptogenic in 16 and symptomatic in 12. The current dosage regime of anticonvulsants were maintained during the trial period.

The controlled group was defined as the subjects whose seizures were suppressed within one year after the onset and the other subjects were classified into the refractory group.
