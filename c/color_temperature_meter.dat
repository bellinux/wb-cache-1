25|$|Photographers {{sometimes}} use <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>meters.</b> These {{are usually}} designed to read only two regions along the visible spectrum (red and blue); more expensive ones read three regions (red, green, and blue). However, they are ineffective with {{sources such as}} fluorescent or discharge lamps, whose light varies in color and may be harder to correct for. Because this light is often greenish, a magenta filter may correct it. More sophisticated colorimetry tools can be used if such meters are lacking.|$|R
50|$|Photographers and cinematographers use {{information}} provided by these meters to decide what color balancing {{should be done to}} make different light sources appear to have the same <b>color</b> <b>temperature.</b> If the user enters the reference <b>color</b> <b>temperature,</b> the <b>meter</b> can calculate the mired difference between the measurement and the reference, enabling the user to choose a corrective color gel or photographic filter with the closest mired factor.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new method for image {{searches}} and image indexing in databases with a <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> histogram. The <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> histogram {{can be used}} for performance improvement of content–based image retrieval by using a combination of <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> and histogram. The <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> histogram can be represented by a range of 46 colors. That is more than the color histogram and the dominant <b>color</b> <b>temperature.</b> Moreover, with our method the colors that have the same <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> can be separated while the dominant <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> can not. The results showed that the <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> histogram retrieved an accurate image more often than the dominant <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> method or <b>color</b> histogram method. This also took less time so the <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> {{can be used for}} indexing and searching for images.

5000|$|Color temp or <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> is {{a measure}} of the {{frequency}} of light given off by the bulb. 2700 K is equivalent to a standard incandescent light.

2500|$|Black-body {{radiators}} are {{the reference}} {{by which the}} whiteness of light sources is judged. A black body can be described by its <b>color</b> <b>temperature,</b> whose hues are depicted above. By analogy, nearly Planckian light sources such as certain fluorescent or high-intensity discharge lamps can be judged by their correlated <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> (CCT), the <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> of the Planckian radiator that best approximates them. For light source spectra that are not Planckian, <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> is not a well defined attribute; the concept of correlated <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> was developed to map such sources as well as possible onto the one-dimensional scale of <b>color</b> <b>temperature,</b> where [...] "as well as possible" [...] is defined {{in the context of}} an objective color space.|$|R
25|$|<b>Color</b> <b>temperature</b> can be {{indicated}} in kelvins or mireds (1 million {{divided by the}} <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> in kelvins). The <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> of a light source is the temperature of a black body that has the same chromaticity (i.e. color) as the light source. A notional <b>temperature,</b> the correlated <b>color</b> <b>temperature,</b> the temperature of a black body which emits light of a hue which to human color perception most closely matches {{the light from the}} lamp, is assigned.|$|R
50|$|<b>Color</b> <b>{{temperature}}</b> {{for white}} light sources also affects their use for certain applications. The <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> {{of a white}} light source is the temperature in kelvins of a theoretical black body emitter that most closely matches the spectral characteristics of the lamp. An incandescent bulb has a <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> around 2800 to 3000 kelvins; daylight is around 6400 kelvins. Lower <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> lamps have relatively more energy in the yellow and red part of the visible spectrum, while high <b>color</b> <b>temperatures</b> correspond to lamps with more of a blue-white appearance. For critical inspection or color matching tasks, or for retail displays of food and clothing, the <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> of the lamps will be selected for the best overall lighting effect.|$|R
30|$|<b>Color</b> <b>{{temperature}}</b> {{refers to}} the temperature of a black-body radiator that emits light that is similar in color {{to that of the}} light source. A black body is an object that completely absorbs all of the radiant energy incident on the surface. As the black body is heated, its color changes to red, white, and blue. If the <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> of the light source does not exactly match that of the black-body radiator, the <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> with the closest value, i.e., the correlated <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> (CCT), can be used; since the colors of the black-body radiator and light source never exactly match, CCT is used to represent the <b>color</b> <b>temperature.</b> Kelvin (K) is the unit used to express the <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> [11]. In photography, <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> is used to adjust the white balance, which is purposed to correct the color distortions observed as a result of taking pictures in an environment with natural or artificial lighting.|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} LED <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> {{preference and}} effectiveness in a task light setting {{for older adults}} with a comparison to younger adults. Test subjects included visually active adults, male and female, from 19 years to 96 years of age. The researcher tested one hundred participants from several test sites. The researcher ascertained conclusions based on the correlations of age, gender, visual acuity, time of day, and visual medical conditions to LED preference. A tunable lamp with four correlated <b>color</b> <b>temperatures</b> (CCT/K), 2700 K, 3500 K, 4100 K, and 5000 K was analyzed using timed and graded, reading and number comparison tasks.

50|$|The {{illuminance}} of {{a source}} is the dominating factor for deciding {{as to whether}} or not a source is pleasing or comfortable, as viewers participating in this experiment evaluated a range of correlated <b>color</b> <b>temperatures</b> and illuminance levels, yet their impressions remained generally unchanged as correlated <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> changed. Additionally, there is a relationship between correlated <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> and appeared brightness of a source.

25|$|Lighting {{designers}} sometimes select filters by <b>color</b> <b>temperature,</b> commonly {{to match}} light that is theoretically white.

Fixtures with color mixing features or with multiple colors, (if including 3200K) are also capable of producing tungsten-like light. <b>Color</b> <b>temperature</b> {{may also be a}} factor when selecting lamps, since each is likely to have a different <b>color</b> <b>temperature.</b>|$|R
50|$|With HMI bulbs, <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> varies {{significantly}} with lamp age.

As the bulb ages, the <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> reaches its nominal value of around 5600 K or 6000 K. With age, the arc length becomes larger as more of the electrodes burn away. This requires greater voltage to sustain the arc, and as voltage increases, <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> decreases proportionately {{at a rate of}} approximately 0.5-1 kelvin for every hour burnt. For this reason, and other safety reasons, HMI bulbs are not recommended to be used past half their lifetime.|$|R

50|$|For example, natural {{daylight}} has a <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> of 6500 K and an illuminance {{of about}} 104 to 105 lux.

At typical indoor office illuminance levels of about 400 lux, pleasing <b>color</b> <b>temperatures</b> are lower (between 3000 and 6000 K), and at typical home illuminance levels of about 75 lux, pleasing <b>color</b> <b>temperatures</b> are even lower (between 2400 and 2700 K). These color temperature-illuminance pairs are often achieved with fluorescent and incandescent sources, respectively. It is noteworthy that the pleasing region of the curve contains <b>color</b> <b>temperatures</b> and illuminance levels comparable to naturally lit environments.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} gels for color {{correction}}, such as CTB ("Color Temperature Blue") and CTO ("Color <b>Temperature</b> Orange"). <b>Color</b> correction gels alter or [...] "correct" [...] the <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> {{of a light}} to more closely match the <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> of a film negative or the white balance of a digital imager. Specifically CTB, which is blue in appearance, will correct tungsten lights that typically have a <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> {{in the range of}} 3,200 K (kelvins) to 5,700 K to more closely match the <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> of [...] "Daylight" [...] negative, which is usually around 5,400 K (nominal daylight). CTO, which is orange in appearance, will correct a [...] "Daylight" [...] balanced light source (such as many common HMI bulbs) to match the <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> of Tungsten negative, which is typically 3,200 K.

25|$|To {{deal with}} the problem of having to compare light sources of {{different}} correlated <b>color</b> <b>temperatures</b> (CCT), the CIE settled on using a reference black body with the same <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> for lamps with a CCT of under 5000K, or a phase of CIE standard illuminant D (daylight) otherwise. This presented a continuous range of <b>color</b> <b>temperatures</b> to choose a reference from.

40|$|Recently LED (Lighting Emitting Diode) {{lighting}} {{sources are}} applied {{not only for}} displays like LED BLU (back light unit) TV but also for general lighting like LED lamps for home and office. The <b>color</b> <b>temperature,</b> or chromaticity, and brightness of LED lighting can be easily controlled. Preferred combinations between illuminance and <b>color</b> <b>temperature</b> of lighting depend on daily living activities (Oi et al., 2007 Symposium on Design of Artificial Environments 214 – 215). Changes in intensity can be more easily detected than color changes (Almeida et al., 2009 Perception 38 1109 – 1117).
