50|$|The {{bridge was}} closed for {{reinforcement}} works between late 2008 and October 2009 {{as part of the}} Central Connector, a 3 km rapid transit corridor bus priority route connecting the Auckland CBD to Newmarket and other destinations. It received a $7 million <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>strengthening</b> upgrade to bring it up to current earthquake standards and to enable it to serve as a dedicated route for large numbers of buses. It can now accommodate up to 1200 bus trips a day. The bridge now has a load-carrying capacity of 40 tonnes, instead of the previous 13 tonnes. In October 2009 the bridge was reopened by Mayor John Banks. The footpaths are covered with curved transparent screens installed in 2002, to prevent people from falling or jumping off and providing weather cover (the bridge had suicide prevention barriers from as early as 1936, replaced with mesh screens in 1957 that were removed in 1997. After the removal, suicides increased fivefold, leading to a quiet re-installation in 2002). There have been no suicides from the bridge since then until 2015, and the feature has been called an example of best practice of preventing such acts.|$|E

A good example of this is the West Gate Bridge in Melbourne, Australia, the subject of this paper, which has recently been reinforced in the largest applications of <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> bridge <b>strengthening</b> in the world. <b>Carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced polymers (CFRP) were chosen as the preferred means of strengthening the WGB concrete viaducts because of their durability, ease of installation and ability to adhere to irregular geometries.

40|$|Many of the {{existing}} reinforced concrete structures throughout the world are in urgent need of strengthening, repair or reconstruction because of deterioration due to various factors like corrosion, lack of detailing, failure of bonding between beam-column joints, increase in service loads, etc., leading to cracking, spalling, loss of strength, deflection, etc., Direct observation of these damaged structures has shown that damage occurs usually at the beam-column joints, with failure in bending or shear, depending on geometry and reinforcement distribution type. A nonlinear finite element analysis that is a simulation technique is used in this work {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of retrofitting technique called “wrapping technique” for using <b>carbon</b> <b>fibres</b> (FRP) for <b>strengthening</b> of RC beam-column connections damaged due to various reasons. After carrying out a nonlinear finite element analysis of a reinforced concrete frame (Controlled Specimen) and reinforced concrete frame where <b>carbon</b> <b>fibres</b> are attached to the beam column joint portion in different patterns,the measured response histories of the original and strengthened specimens are then subsequently compared.

In this study, we assess the life cycle environmental implications of recovering <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> and producing composite materials as substitutes for conventional and proposed lightweight materials in automotive applications (e. g., steel, aluminium, virgin <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre).</b> Key parameters for the recycled <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> materials, including fibre volume fraction and fibre alignment, are investigated to identify beneficial uses of recycled <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> in the automotive sector. Recycled <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> components can achieve the lowest life cycle environmental impacts of all materials considered, although the actual impact is highly dependent on the design criteria (λ value) of the specific component. Low production impacts associated with recycled <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> components are observed relative to lightweight competitor materials (e. g., aluminium, virgin <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced plastic). In addition, recycled <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> components have low in-use energy use due to mass reductions and associated reduction in mass-induced fuel consumption.

40|$|Abstract: Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) -based <b>carbon</b> <b>fibres</b> were surface {{treated by}} ozone modifica-tion method and air-oxidation treatment. The {{interfacial}} properties of <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced polyamide 6 (CF/PA 6) composites were investigated {{by means of}} the single fibre pull-out tests. The surface characteristics of <b>carbon</b> <b>fibres</b> were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spec-troscopy (XPS). As a result, it was found that interfacial shear strength values of the composites with ozone-treated <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> are greatly increased. XPS results show that ozone treatment increases the amount of carboxyl groups on the <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> surface, thus the interfacial adhe-sion between <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> and PA 6 matrix is effectively promoted. The effect of surface treatment of <b>carbon</b> <b>fibres</b> on the tribological properties of CF/PA 6 composites was comparatively investi-gated.

The treated fibres were stabilised in air at 160 C followed by pyrolysis at 800 C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The resulting <b>carbon</b> <b>fibres</b> were characterised in terms of carbon yield, tensile strength, surface roughness, porosity, crystal structure and surface hydrophobicity. The <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> yield was 16. 7 % for the untreated while the lignin pre-treatment increased the carbon yield up to 25. 8 %.

40|$|In {{this report}} <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> {{in the form}} of braided rope was {{considered}} for the possibility of use in reinforcing concrete. Braided <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> ropes were considered for applications such as tendons for prestressed concrete or grids for slabs and beams. Experimental investigations that were carried out by Cortis, Kaczmarcyzyk, & Pearce, (2013) reported a low bonding strength between concrete and braided <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> rope. This means braided <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> despite having exceptional mechanical properties may not be used for prestressed concrete. However, braided <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> may be used for post-tensioning of concrete.

40|$|This article {{examines}} material economies of <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> as a prosthetic form of masculinity. The paper advances three main arguments. Firstly, <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> {{can be a}} site in which disability is overcome, an act of overcoming that is affected through masculinized technology. Secondly, <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> can be a homosocial surface; that is, <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> becomes both a surface extension {{of the self and}} a third-party mediator in homosocial relationships, a surface that facilitates intimacy between men in ways that devalue femininity in both male and female bodies. <b>Carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> surfaces are material extensions of subjectivity, and <b>carbon</b> <b>fibre</b> surfaces are vectors of the cultural economies of masculine competition.

Previous studies showed that certain ex-PAN <b>carbon</b> <b>fibres</b> exhibit an excellent linear piezoresistive behaviour. Besides the desired strain sensitivity, kl, in the longitudinal direction, <b>carbon</b> <b>fibres</b> show a strain sensitivity, kt, transverse to the fibre direction.

The strain sensitivities kl and kt of the investigated ex-PAN fibre (Torayca T 300 B) were determined by varying the ratio between longitudinal strain, "l, and transverse strain, "t, in uniaxial tensile tests and four-point bending tests. The results show a longitudinal strain sensitivity kl {{in the range of}} 1. 72 – 1. 78 and a transverse strain sensitivity kt in the range of 0. 37 – 0. 41.
