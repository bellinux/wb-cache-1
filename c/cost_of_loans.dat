5000|$|A {{reduction}} in the current account deficit is achieved through a decrease in domestic aggregate demand for tradable goods. Since tradable and non-tradable goods are complements, this also reduces demand for non-tradable goods. The demand for tradable goods reflects in a {{reduction in}} imports; however, the lower demand for non-tradable goods translates into lower output and real depreciation of the currency (lower relative price of non tradable to tradable goods). Firms producing non-tradable goods face {{an increase in the}} real cost of financing, as the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> in terms of the price of non-tradable goods rises. These firms get lower revenues, which reduce their ability to repay their loans. As a result, banks face a higher rate of non-performing loans from this sector. In this situation, banks become more cautious and decrease loans, which worsens the economic recession.|$|E

The results indicate that an innovation to monetary policy has a significant within-the-month e?ect on the money market rate. The innovation is then propagated through the money market to the bond market and from there to the bank loan rate market, with the e?ect peaking one to four months after the initial monetary policy shock and lasting for about eight to nine months.

The evidence offered suggests that, in general terms, the financing received by households over the period analysed is in line with what may be inferred from its determinants; however, the high volume of debt incurred entails greater exposure of the sector to unexpected changes in its income, in its wealth or in the cost of borrowing, especially in a setting in which floating-rate loans are increasingly significant. credit, household, error correction...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of credit supply factors in {{business}} cycle fluctuations using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with financial frictions enriched with an imperfectly competitive banking sector. Banks issue collateralized loans to both households and firms, obtain funding via deposits, and accumulate capital out of retained earnings. Loan margins depend on the banks' capital-to-assets ratio and {{on the degree of}} interest rate stickiness. Balance-sheet constraints establish a link between the business cycle, which affects bank profits and thus capital, and the supply and <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans.</b> The model is estimated with Bayesian techniques using data for the euro area. The analysis delivers the following results. First, the banking sector and, in particular, sticky rates attenuate the effects of monetary policy shocks, while financial intermediation increases the propagation of supply shocks. Second, shocks originating in the banking sector explain the largest share of the contraction of economic activity in 2008, while macroeconomic shocks played a limited role. Third, an unexpected destruction of bank capital may have substantial effects on the economy. Copyright (c) 2010 The Ohio State University. ...|$|E

Firms with lowest takeover defense (democracy) pay a 25 % higher spread on their bank loans as compared with firms with the highest takeover defense (dictatorship), after controlling for various firm and loan characteristics. Further investigations indicate that banks charge a higher loan spread to firms with higher takeover vulnerability mainly because of their concern about {{a substantial increase in}} financial risk after the takeover. Our results have important implications for understanding the link between a firm's governance structure and its cost of capital. Our study suggests that firms that rely too much on corporate control market as a governance device are punished by costlier bank loans. The Author 2008.

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Economics) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Using an econometric {{approach}} on panel {{data collected from}} 53 microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Uganda {{over a period of}} six years (annual), this study has identified the determinants of sustainability and outreach of MFIs. In addition, the study has also used survey data from 31 non-Bank of Uganda (BOU) regulated MFIs or Tier 4 MFIs, four BOU-regulated non-bank MFIs, 12 commercial banks and the BOU itself to assess the effects of financial regulation of MFIs on their sustainability and outreach. The results indicate that sustainability is positively and significantly driven by real effective lending rates and age of an MFI, and negatively by the ratio of gross outstanding loan portfolio to total assets, the ratio of average loan size to the national per capita income, the unit <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> disbursed, and a group-based delivery mechanism compared to an individual-based delivery mechanism. Outreach is positively and significantly driven by an MFI being a savings and credit co-operative (SACCO) compared to being a private company, effectiveness of governance, the age of an MFI, the ratio of gross outstanding loan portfolio to total assets, and the ratio of salary/wage paid to staff to the national per capita income, and negatively by the ratio of average loan size to the national per capita income and the unit <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans</b> disbursed. In the short run, financial regulation negatively influences the outreach of MFIs, but positively affects their sustainability. In the long term, financial regulation positively influences both the sustainability and the outreach of MFIs. The results suggest a number of policy options. First, the MFIs should focus on the real effective lending rate, given its significance in their sustainability. Second, for a real effective lending rate to be relatively low, the rate of inflation should be low. This calls for prudent monetary policy management by the government. Thirdly, {{the cost of doing business}} should be kept low. This calls for prudence in business management by the MFIs and creating a cost-effective business environment by the government. While the results are tentative, in order to expand outreach more SACCOs should be established and the MFIs should commit more funds to lending purposes compared to other investments. Finally, before enacting financial legislation, it is important that its benefits and costs are adequately assessed to ensure that the benefits outweigh the costs both in the short and long term...|$|E
40|$|Inclusive {{financial}} sectors {{are important}} for development in terms of equity and efficiency. Although microfinance has developed rapidly, {{little is known about}} the actual costs for clients to access microfinance services, except for interest rates. The insufficient outreach of microfinance in rural areas remains one of the main challenges for the sector. This paper uses the individual data of 255 clients in India and the data of 48 groups to which they belong to compare the transaction costs (TCs) between urban and rural microfinance clients. The results suggest that the TCs incurred by urban microfinance borrowers are globally higher than those incurred by their rural counterparts (4. 81 % compared with 3. 35 %), mainly because of their opportunity expenses and individual costs that are unrelated to microfinance groups. Yet, when considering a household's total monthly expenditure level, the microfinance TCs constitute a much higher relative expenditure for rural households than for their urban counterparts. Total TCs are still relatively low compared with the main <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>loans,</b> i. e. their interest rates. Â© 2013 Copyright Oxford Department of International Development.
