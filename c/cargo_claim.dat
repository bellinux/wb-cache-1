5000|$|Claims {{for damage}} to cargo shipped by ocean carrier in {{international}} commerce {{into and out}} of the United States are governed by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), which is the U.S. enactment of the Hague Rules. One of its key features is that a carrier is liable for cargo damaged from [...] "hook to hook," [...] meaning from loading to discharge, unless it is exonerated under one of 17 exceptions to liability, such as an [...] "act of God," [...] the inherent nature of the goods, errors in navigation, and management of the ship. A shipowner is generally entitled to limit its liability to $500 per package, unless the value of the contents is disclosed and marked on the container. There is significant litigation as to what constitutes a [...] "package" [...] for purposes of determining liability under COGSA. This practice has resulted in substantial and continuing litigation in the United States. Federal Courts in the United States, however, are reluctant to treat an ocean shipping container as a single COGSA package. The statute of limitations on <b>cargo</b> <b>claims</b> is one year.|$|R

40|$|Trade between Britain and China {{is rapidly}} expanding, and {{shipping}} law {{plays an important}} role in facilitating economic activity. This thesis provides an exemplification on the measure of damages in the carriage of goods by sea in both countries. It will help practitioners as well as scholars from both countries to understand the peculiar features and dynamics of the topic in the other’s shipping laws. The Chinese law of damages and shipping law are not as detailed or as well-structured as its English counterpart. Over the years, some articles in the Chinese Maritime Code (CMC) have been interpreted inconsistently, e. g., art. 55, and there is contradiction among different laws on the said topic, resulting in considerable confusion about the law. Bizarre and arguably unjust applications of legal rules continue to surface in claims for damages. A large number of contradictory decisions have been produced in Chinese shipping cases. Similar heads of damages are accepted or rejected in a process which at times seems alarmingly random. It is time to revisit the CMC and the law of damages and to urge their reform. England is a well-established centre of shipping litigation and arbitration in the world and its shipping laws are more influential on Chinese maritime courts than those of any other country. Several senior Chinese scholars suggest that English law is the model on which the reformed CMC should be based. This thesis is written with a view to encouraging a revision of the defects in the CMC and to changing aspects of the current Chinese law of damages. It expounds on the English law part, provides a principled explanation for legal rules in <b>cargo</b> <b>claims,</b> reviews relevant Chinese law, makes comparisons between English and Chinese law at length, addresses the problems in Chinese shipping law and seeks a solution. It is hoped that this thesis can provide instructive recommendations to Chinese lawmakers and clarify the chaos inherent in interpreting the relevant law. In a few aspects, Chinese law seems fairer than the English position, which English scholars may find refreshing and enlightening. This thesis also proposes to increase the awareness of national decision-makers, especially the Chinese, of the international tenor of existing and proposed international maritime laws, as well as the concomitant duty to interpret and implement them as such.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the nature of}} sea carriers' implied obligations of seaworthiness, care of cargo and non-deviation from the voyage route, at common law and under the Hague and Hague-Visby Rules, and their effect on clauses which seek to exclude or modify them. After {{a consideration of the}} historical evolution and nature of the implied obligations, the standards of performance imposed under them at common law is considered before going on to how the peculiar nature of the obligations lead to modified results under the general contract law rules for the construction of exclusion clauses. The discussion proceeds to the standards of the obligations imposed on the carrier by the Hague and Hague-Visby Rules to exercise due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy and to properly and carefully carry the cargo. There is a consideration of the significance of the overriding, as well as the non-delegable nature of these obligations. In particular, whether or not a carrier whose breach of an implied obligation is a cause of the loss or damage to cargo, can rely on the exceptions provided by the Rules is considered in depth. The final sections of the thesis deal with the principles of causation and onus of proof applied in sea <b>cargo</b> <b>claims</b> and how they impact upon the interface between the implied obligations and exclusion clauses. The analysis of causation examines how liability is determined where the carrier's breach of an implied obligation co-operates with or is intervened upon by an excepted peril to produce the loss or damage to cargo. With respect to onus of proof, the issue considered is which party bears the legal burden on proof or disproof of the breach of an implied obligation: must the cargo owner establish affirmatively that the particular breach asserted caused his loss or is it for the carrier, as part of his defence, and claim for exemption from liability. to negative breach? The thesis advances two principal arguments. First, it is argued that because of the development of the implied obligations of seaworthiness, care of cargo and non-deviation from route as important obligations which underlie the carriage contract, strict and utmost care standards of performance are imposed under them at common law and under the Hague-Visby Rules respectively. Secondly, it is argued that the result of these high standards of performance {{is that there is a}} "risk" approach to liability which explains the peculiar rules of construction, causation and onus of proof which import restriction on the effect of sea carriers' exclusion clauses.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} how {{the absence of}} insurance in the past led to some special maritime liability law principles such as 'general average' (i. e., losses or expenses shared by all the parties to a maritime adventure) and the limitation of shipowners' liability. In the absence of insurance, these principles served the function of insurance mostly for shipowners. As commercial marine insurance is now widely available, these principles have lost their justification and may in fact interfere with the most important goal of liability law i. e., deterrence from negligence. The thesis thus recommends their abolition. The thesis further argues that when insurance is easily available and affordable to the both parties to a liability claim, the main goal of liability law should be deterrence as opposed to compensation. This is exactly {{the case with the}} maritime <b>cargo</b> liability <b>claims</b> where both <b>cargo</b> owners and shipowners are invariably insured. As a result, the sole focus of cargo liability law should be and, to a great extent, is deterrence. On the other hand, in the vessel-source oil pollution liability setting, pollution victims are not usually insured. Therefore, oil pollution liability law has to cater both for compensation and deterrence, the two traditional goals of liability law. The final question the thesis addresses is whether the deterrent effect of liability law is affected by the availability of liability insurance. Contrary the popular belief the thesis attempts to prove that the presence of liability insurance is not necessarily a hindrance but can be a complementary force towards the realization of deterrent goal of liability law...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject matter}} of this thesis is the {{liability}} of the sea carrier in the international carriage of goods by sea. Chapter One: discuses the nature of liability of the sea carrier under the Hague/Visby Rules and Hamburg Rules. The Hague/Visby Rules define the term “Carrier” as including the owner or the charterer who enters into contract of carriage with the shipper, while Hamburg Rules widen the definition to include any person by whom or on whose name contract of carriage of goods by sea has been concluded with a shipper. The Hague/Visby scheme of liability is built on specific obligations by which the carrier is bound, i. e. the obligation to issue a bill of lading, obligation to exercise due diligence, to provide a seaworthy ship and the obligation of care of cargo. The failure of the carrier in the fulfillment of the obligations will expose him to <b>cargo</b> <b>claims</b> by shippers or cargo owners in cases of loss or damage to cargo. He will be held as liable for damages unless he proves that he is exempted form liability by virtue {{of one of the}} seventeen exceptions provided for in Article IV. The most significant of them are: fire; perils of the sea; force majeure, nautical fault; acts and omissions of the shipper. Hamburg Rules introduce a relatively simple scheme of liability based on the “presumed fault” by the carrier his agents or servants. Thus in cases of loss or damage to cargo the carrier is held to be liable unless he proves that he, his servants and agents were not at fault. Chapter Two: considers the scope of liability under the Hague/Visby Rules. They cover bills of lading which are issued in contracting state or which incorporate the Rules by paramount clause. They cover the international outward carriage only. While under Hamburg Rules it is immaterial whether or not a bill of lading has been issued. The Rules cover contract of carriage concluded in a contracting state or if the port of loading or port of discharge is in a contracting state. Moreover if the optional port of discharge is in a contracting state. Similarly, it can be incorporated by paramount clause in the bill of lading. Hamburg Rules cover the inward and outward international carriage. The period of application under the Hague/Visby Rules is limited from the time of loading till the time of discharge, i. e. “tackle to tackle” period, while Hamburg Rules cover the entire voyage until the goods are handed over or put in disposal of the cargo owner. The Hague/Visby Rules do not provide for liability in cases of delay in delivery. They exclude the live animals and deck cargo from the definition of goods. While Hamburg Rules provide for liability of carrier in cases of delay in delivery. They bring all cargoes under their umbrella. Thus they provide for liability of the carrier in cases of live animals and deck cargo. Both conventions provide for liability for shipment of dangerous cargoes. The well known doctrine of deviation under the common law is still in use under the Hague/Visby Rules. It operates to hold the carrier as in a fundamental breach of contract unless he proves that he deviates to save life or property at sea. Hamburg Rules do not recognize the doctrine of deviation. Chapter Three: considers the limits of liability and limits of actions. The same system of calculating the limit of liability is valid under both conventions, i. e. the dual system of per package, per kilo. The former is for goods with high value compared to their weight, while the latter is suitable for bulk cargoes. Although the Hague/Visby Rules introduce a provision for calculating limit of liability in containerized goods, i. e. according to the items enumerated on the bill of lading, the position is still ambiguous. The unit of account is Poincare franc which is replaced by the additional Protocol ١٩٧٩ by the Special Drawing Right (SDR) and so forth under Hamburg Rules. The limits should be broken when the carrier is in default of negligence, recklessness or intentional acts. Moreover, the carrier cannot be benefited by the limits of liability under the Hague/Visby Rules if he is in default i. e. in cases of fundamental breach of contract such as deviations or stowage on deck without shippers consent...|$|R

UNITA then attacked Baia-do-Cuio, followed by an attack on Golungo Alto, a city 200 km east of Luanda, a few days later. The militants advanced on Golungo Alto at 2:00 pm on 21 May, staying until 9:00 pm on 22 May when the Angolan military retook the town. They looted local businesses, taking food and alcoholic beverages before singing drunkenly in the streets. More than 700 villagers trekked 60 km from Golungo Alto to Ndalatando, the provincial capital of Cuanza Norte, without injury. According to an aid official in Ndalatando, the Angolan military prohibited media coverage of the incident, so the details of the attack are unknown. Joffre Justino, UNITA's spokesman in Portugal, said UNITA only attacked Gungo Alto to demonstrate the government's military inferiority and the need to cut a deal. Four days later UNITA released the children to a Catholic mission in Camabatela, a city 200 km from where UNITA kidnapped them. The national organization said the abduction violated their policy towards the treatment of civilians. In a letter to the bishops of Angola, Jonas Savimbi asked the Catholic Church to act as an intermediary between UNITA and the government in negotiations. The attacks took their toll on Angola's economy. At the end of May 2001, De Beers, the international diamond mining company, suspended its operations in Angola, ostensibly on the grounds that negotiations with the national government reached an impasse.|$|R
40|$|The “charterer’s {{liability}} insurance” {{is a type}} {{of marine}} insurance. Most ships are chartered either on a time charter or voyage charter contract. In both cases the charterer assumes liabilities towards the shipowner because of damage caused to the ship in the course of cargo-handling or because of damage resulting from an unsafe port or berth. And also, the charterer becomes liable similarly to the shipowner, with P&I liability to <b>cargo,</b> pollution <b>claims</b> and etc. All charterers require cover for both damage to hull and other P&I liabilities. The so-called “charterer’s liability insurance” provides coverage for such risks. I choose charterer’s liability insurance as the topic mostly because of the fast development of chartering ships in the market and the large number of disputes arising thereof. During my research, I found that there might be disputes arising out of the charter party, most of which is in relation to the damage to ships and general average after the casualties. The disputes become a major problem facing the charterer if he does not have a charterer’s liability insurance policy or he did not rightly enter such a policy. Moreover, the disputes may hinder the development of shipping market. In international P&I associations like Sculd and Gard, quite a number of vessels are enterers on the basis of charterer’s entry. To better understand this particular type of insurance and to discover certain practical problems about it, I will discuss sup-topics in the following chapters: Legal Sources (chapter 2), Charterer’s Risks (chapter 3), Overview of Charterer’s Liability Insurance Policy (chapter 4), Liability Cover (chapter 5), General Average Cover (chapter 6), Legal Expenses Cover (chapter 7) and Exclusions and Limitations of Coverage (chapter 8). For this mission, this thesis will adopt the comparative method by comparing the legislation and P&I Association rules of China, Norway and England, and by referring to different charter parties, different charterer’s liability insurance policies and several cases. The differences in relation to charterer’s liability insurance such as the legal framework, the cover of risks insured and limitation of risk between countries can be found anywhere especially when you are trying to make them clear by comparing eastern laws like China with western systems like Norway and U. K. However the situation is changing with the globalization...|$|R
40|$|Abstract When a ship {{is fixed}} on a voyage charter or time charter, the {{charterer}} may use tonnage {{which has been}} chartered to him to transport goods owned by third-party cargo owners. This thesis will discuss this situation: the charterer entered into the contract of carriage of goods by sea with sender, {{but it is the}} ship-owner who actually performs the carriage of goods as actual carrier. If the cargo is damaged or lost, whether the ship-owner shall be liable to the third party? If it is the case, on what legal basis third-party <b>cargo</b> owners can <b>claim</b> against ship-owners? What is the nature of ship-owner s liability to the third party? How does such ship-owner s liability system apply to business practice? All these questions will be analyzed in this paper. Firstly, I will present the legal relationship between parties involved in the carriage where the charterer uses the chartered vessel to carry third party cargo owner goods. It is known that the ship-owner has no contractual obligations to cargo owners, as the ship-owner is not the contracting party to the head contract of carriage of goods by sea. However Section 286 of NMC imposes statutory liability on ship-owners and Section 285 and 287 of NMC cause ship-owner and charterer jointly and severally liable to third-party cargo claimants. Such mandatory liability system aims to strengthen the economic position of cargo interests, but ship-owners and charterers are still free to insert clauses to allocate risks between them as long as such the clauses do not derogate from mandatory provisions. This paper will discuss two common clauses regarding ship-owner s liability, that is, demise clause and incorporation clause. I will analyze whether these clauses are caught by obligatory provisions and if they are not, how those clauses apply in practical business. Finally I will discuss indemnification claims between ship-owner and charterer. When the ship-owner is found liable under a bill of lading, and if such claim under the charter party would have allowed him to avoid of at least limit liability, the ship-owner has rights to seek indemnity from charterer according to Section 338 of NMC. However Section 338 does not provide cargo claimants with an absolute right to redress and certain requirements must be satisfied, that is, the greater obligations assumed by the ship-owner must result from different terms contained in the bill of lading and there must be contractual basis for indemnity in the charter party. All these issues mentioned above will be discussed mainly under Norwegian maritime law, but some comparison will be made between Norwegian maritime law and Chinese maritime law. Besides that, I will also take relevant international conventions into consideration including the Hague/Visby Rules and the Hamburg Rules...|$|R
