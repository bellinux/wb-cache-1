40|$|Due to the {{occurrence}} of ponding {{during the period of}} rice growth, the analyses of rainfall-runoff in paddy fields are different from those in general lands. The diffusive tank model has been successfully applied in rainfall-runoff simulations in paddy fields because it can well describe the features of the local water flow. In most of the applications of this model, although the determination of the related model parameters is important, detailed investigations on each individual parameter are definitely needed to improve the accuracy of the results. In the study, an improved procedure is proposed to determine certain variables involved in the diffusive tank model and the application is conducted in a field area in Taiwan. In the application, the roughness of the river channel was assessed according to the actual field conditions. Instead of using the observed water levels in each rainfall event, the notch width of the rectangular <b>contracted</b> <b>weir</b> per unit area was evaluated by direct field measurements to calibrate the discharge coefficient. Test results from the selected field in six rainfall events showed that the local average value of the notch width of the rectangular <b>contracted</b> <b>weir</b> per unit area was 1. 025 m/ha. Compared to the results of field measurements, the relative errors of the predictions were within 3 % in all tests of rainfall events. In addition, for different types of catchment partitions, {{it was found that the}} corresponding weir discharge coefficients remained roughly unchanged.

40|$|A {{combined}} weir {{consisting of}} a sharp crested rectangular <b>contracted</b> <b>weir</b> and an inverted triangular weir below is a flow regulation device used in irrigation works lot diverting the flow from a main channel to a secondary channel. The present practice for computing the discharge for classical rectangular find triangular weirs is from curves or equations relating the discharge coefficient and the upstream depth/gate opening ratio parameter including weir geometry, and tailwater depth/gate opening ratio being the fourth parameter which is needed to be updated. The discharge for simultaneous flow still in addition involves few more parameters: {{the distance between the}} weirs, the slope of the apron, the opening depth and weir angle. In this paper one generalized equation including all the important variables is obtained from the experimental investigations. This equation is suitable for both horizontal and sloping channel bed under submerged flow and for the free flow, the tailwater depth/weir opening ratio term being neglected. The predictions of the equation agreed well with the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Submerged flow {{exists for}} any given {{structure}} when a change in flow depth downstream from the structure causes a change in flow depth upstream from the structure {{for any given}} constant value of discharge. The two flow depths, normally measured when submerged flow exists, consist of a depth upstream from the structure, which is used also for free flow conditions, and a depth of flow located any place downstream from the structure. The initial studies in which the submerged flow analysis was developed were made on flat-bottomed flumes (Hyatt, 1965; and Skogerboe, Walker, and Robinson, 1965). Later studies verified the method of analysis for Parshall flumes (Skogerboe, Hyatt, England, and John son, 1965; and Hyatt, Skogerboe, and Eggleston, 1966). Because of previous findings, it was felt this method of analyzing submerged flow {{could be applied to}} various types and kinds of weirs. Original development of the parameters and relationships which describe submerged flow came from a combination of dimensional analysis and empiricism. Further verification of the parameters developed in this manner are obtained by employing momentum relationships. Both approaches to the submerged flow problem are discussed in this report. Considerable effort and study has been expended on free and submerged flow weirs by other authors in previous years. For this reason the authors of this report went to the literature as a source of data. Various studies typifying a particular type of weir structure were investigated and the data selected from these studies were subjected to the submerged flow analysis developed by the authors. The data from these studies provide further verification of validity of the approach to the submerged flow problem made by the authors. Acknowledgement is given and appreciation expressed to those authors whose studies provided the data used in the analysis presented in this report. Although no investigation was made of a <b>contracted</b> <b>weir,</b> the authors feel that the submerged flow analysis as explained in this report would be just as valid for this type of structure...|$|E
40|$|Real-time flow {{measurement}} and monitoring are important components of modern irrigation SCADA systems. Many projects have existing sharp-crested weir structures {{that have not}} been incorporated into SCADA systems because they are partially contracted, and thus do not have a simple rating equation relationship. The Kindsvater-Carter procedure for calibrating partially <b>contracted</b> sharp-crested <b>weirs</b> is accurate and straightforward, but also somewhat tedious.

Furthermore, through regression analysis, the spreadsheet determines a simplified rating equation that can easily be incorporated into remote terminal units (RTUs) and SCADA systems.

From the practical point of view the availability of a unique stage-discharge formula that can be applied for the different types of the rectangular weirs would be of great practical importance. At first, in this paper the Buckingham’s Theorem of the dimensional analysis and the self-similarity theory are used to deduce the stage-discharge curve of different kinds of rectangular weirs such as slit and partially contracted ones. Then the proposed formula is calibrated using both the experimental data available in the literature and the measurements carried out in this investigation.

40|$|Introduction: The {{compound}} sharp-crested weirs {{are composed}} from several notches {{and those are}} designedin different shapes. One of the hydraulic advantagesof compound weirs is that atlowflow rate, the bottomnotchacts assimpleweir andwith the creation of morehydraulicheadonits upstream, due to theshape of thenotch, make dischargemeasurement withappropriatesensitivity. In high flow rates, the upper notch prevents of increasing upstream water level and backwater and discharge measurement is possible with acceptable accuracy. The compound sharp-crested weirs {{can be used as}} an appropriate solution for discharge measurement with reasonable accuracy and sensitivity of the extensive range of flows. Relations are derived from this kind of weirs hassufficientaccuracy withobservation of design criteriaandconstructionstandards. The purposeofthisresearch was a laboratory investigation of geometricandhydraulic effective parameterson discharge coefficient of compound arched circular- rectangular sharp-crested weirs in two cases of full width of channel and partially <b>contracted</b> <b>weirs</b> and compare the values of the discharge coefficient of compound and simple rectangular weirs. Materials and Methods:Considering the geometric, kinematic and dynamic variables affecting the free flow of sharp-crested weirs, there are 11 independent variableswiththree main quantities (length, massandtime). Usingdimensional analysis with π-Buckinghammethod,it can bederived thedimansionlessrelationship. In order to assess theeffect of various parametersonthe coefficient ofCd,thedimansionlessdiagramsare used. Inthe state of(h≤h 0), discharge relationship usedinsimplecircular weir. In thestate of(h>h 0), discharge of compound weir is computeted from the linear combination of discharge relationships in circular and rectangular weirs. Experimentsare conducted inthe hydraulic engineering models laboratory, Department of Water Engineering, University of Tabriz, in a rectangular glass-metal flume of 9 m length, 25 cm width and 50 cm height. Aftersetting up the weirs in a relevant place of flume andestablish thesteady flow,experiments were performedinthefree flowon 36 models of weirs. Results and Discussion:In this research, theeffects ofrectangularnotch width, the height of weir crest, the height ofcirculararch notch were investigated forchanges of headwithdimensionless ratios of h/P,h/R,h/h_ 0,h/Bon discharge coefficient. The results showthat fora known headover the weir, discharge coefficient increase about 2 to 10 percent with the development of the rectangular notch width of compound and simple rectangular sharp-crested weirs. For a given head over the weir, discharge coefficient decrease approximately 1 to 5 percent by increasing the height of the weir crest of compound and simple sharp-crested weirs. Fora given head over weir in low head values, discharge coefficient increase approximately 35 percent by reducing the height of circulararch notch in the compound weirs than simple rectangular weirs. Based on statistical indicators, computational and observation discharge coefficient values in most compound and simple weirs, acceptable coincidence with each other. The meanvalues of thecoefficient of determination (R 2) androot mean square error(RMSE) are 0. 630 and 0. 061,respectively. Among the effective factors that indicate the difference, it can be referred to the theoretical equation in the compound state that is obtained by assuming a linear combination of simple weirs. The effect of the lateral walls of the flume, the measurement accuracy of hydraulic head and discharge, the conditions of flow entrance, the extension of the range of empirical equations proposed in literature for discharge coefficient of simple weirs, Other factors contributing to the difference between the estimated and observed values of discharge coefficient. Inthistypeofweirs,the least amount ofdiscontinuityin thetransition region of simple to compound state in head-discharge relationship can be seenin thewide rangeofdischargescomparedwithother kinds ofcompound weirswithhorizontalorslopingcrests. Conclusion:In this research, a seri of experiments conducted to investigate Cd of the compound arched circular-rectangular sharp-crested weirs in both full width of the channel and partially contracted. The advantage of these weirsisdischarge measurement ina wide range. According to the parametersaffecting theweir, Cd has changed from 0. 54 to 0. 89 range in the compound weirs and 0. 55 to 0. 66 range in the simple rectangular weirs.

40|$|Abstract Enabling {{diadromous}} fishes to enter, {{pass through}} and exit fish diversion structures, such as fishways, with minimal delay remains a challenge. The Conte Laboratory’s Air Directed Passage (ADP) technology acts to supplement volitional behavioral cues by exploiting fish sensitivity/aversion to high energy flow fields established with a sequentially activated series of parallel air diffusers (medium bubble flexible membrane type) positioned at strategic locations {{along the floor}} of test fishways. Compressed air flow is controlled by a PLC/solenoid valve system that acts to pulse air introductions at high frequency so as to actively herd fish toward upstream water inlet structures. ADP allows for control of progression (sweep) speed, direction, energy level and frequency of repeat sweeps. Tests of ADP were conducted using actively migrating wild adult Connecticut River American shad (Alosa sapidissima) collected mid-May through early June 2014 (N= 408). Collected fish were measured for length, sexed, and tagged externally with 23 mm half-duplex PIT tags and held overnight. Trials were performed in a laboratory flume measuring 3 m X 18 m that received Connecticut River water {{at a rate of}} 368 l/s which provided a working depth of 137 cm. Water entered the flume via a <b>contracted</b> rectangular <b>weir</b> 91 cm in width with a delta H of 35. 6 cm. The flume bulkhead supporting the weir incorporated aprons and a ramped floor to streamline flow. The floor of the flume incorporated 14 recessed rows of diffusers positioned at 1. 2 m centers along its longitudinal axis. Each row relied on 17 diffusers for air release. Air flow was applied at 5 m^ 3 /min with rest periods of 1 min between the 10 successive ADP sweeps used per trial. Fish passage rates were monitored by PIT antennas interfaced to a multi-reader PIT tag recorder. ADP increased passage rate 7. 7 fold over selected test periods when compared to controls, i. e., 3. 83 % vs 0. 44 % per min...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Pivot weirs (sharp crested {{inclined}} weirs, Fig. 1 -a) {{is frequently}} used for discharge measurement, controlling water surface and flow diversion. Some typical features of pivot weirs are: (a) overshot design for better water level control, (b) Their application as head gates, turnout or check structure which requiring low head loss and high accuracy, (c) ease of removing sediment deposit behind the weir, and (d) {{ability to manage}} and monitor on-site or operating remotely when connected to a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) network. Kindsvater and Carter (8) derived a weir discharge equation based on energy and continuity equations. Hulsing (4) determined head-discharge relationship of inclined suppressed sharp crested weir with the slope of 3 : 3, 2 : 3 and 1 : 3 toward downstream and compared them with the equivalent normal sharp crested weir. In the USBR report on pivot weirs (regarding The Boulder Canyon Project, 1948) the head discharge data of the suppressed pivot weir were presented in a channel with 5. 5 m length, 2. 9 m depth and 0. 61 m width. Some field experiments were also {{carried out in the}} IID (Imperial Irrigation District) on a trapezoidal cross-section (0. 61 m bottom width) channel with pivot weir of 1. 7 m length, and two different widths of 1. 63 m. The flow rate (350 - 880 lit/s) was held constant and different angles (15 - 50 °) calibrated instead of holding the angle constant and varying the flow rate. Some other laboratory tests were performed with Wahlin and Replogle (1994) on two pivot weirs with 1. 2 m and 1. 14 m width for the 0. 61 m and 0. 46 m length of blade and contraction factor of 0. 925. RUBICON Company established an extensive operation on the application and automation of pivot weirs in irrigation channels in Australia (Www. rubicon. com). All previous studies concentrated on modifying the normal rectangular weir head-discharge equation {{so that it can be}} used for the pivot weirs. In this study, it is trying to derive a unique head-discharge equation for pivot weirs based on dimension analysis and critical discharge equation (implementing Ferro rule). This equation can be used for different inclined angles and side contractions. The obtained unique and simple discharge equation can be used in automation of this structure. Material and Method: In this research, experimental data consist of experiments carried out in hydraulic research institute of Tehran, Iran and experiments of USBR on Pivot weir with side contraction in 0. 925 in the canal with 1. 14 m width and 0. 46 m blade length (Wahlin and Replogle, 1994). Experiments of the water institute of Tehran were carried out in the concrete rectangular weir with 10. 30 m long, 1 m wide and 1 m depth (Fig. 2). Experimental model was consisted of canals, water supply system, dampers (avoided of turbulent flow upstream of pivot weir), pivot weirs, sluice gate at the end of the channel (make different tail waters). With respect to laboratory equipment’s, three pivot weirs with of 80 × 65, 60 × 55 and 40 × 40 (cm×cm) respectively length of the blade and the width was built and set 5. 5 m far from the first of the canal. Discharge was determined from the calibrated weir located at the upstream of pivot weir. A manual point gauge with ± 0. 01 mm sensitivity was used to measure water surface levels. Extraction of discharge equation: Dimensional Analysis based on Ferro rule (2000 and 2001) is used to determine the discharge formula of pivot weirs. Since the h-Q function is usually exponential, the relation between dimensionless parameters could be defined as Ferro rule. Results and Discussion: The rating curve of the pivot weirs with different side contractions is compared with the normal suppressed rectangular weir (equal weir height) in Fig. 3. The discharge of normal suppressed rectangular weir was calculated from the discharge equation of Kindsvater-Carter and discharge coefficient of Rehbock (1) for the equal weir height and head of pivot weirs. For a constant water head, the discharge of pivot weir with a side contraction of 0. 925 is more than the normal suppressed weir. When the weir plate is inclined to the bottom of the canal, because of the stagnation area behind the weir plate, the streamlines approach the weir blade smoothly and the energy dissipation is lower than for the normal weirs. The vortex behind the weir plate increases as the inclined angle increases and subsequently the discharge coefficient decreases. Reduction of discharge for a constant water head in <b>contract</b> <b>weirs</b> is simply justified by decreasing of the weir width. The α and β coefficients were obtained based on all experimental data. Discharge equation obtained based on critical depth-discharge equation. Conclusion: In this study, based on dimension analysis a unique head-discharge relation was obtained which could be used for different inclined angels and side contractions. This equation is more appropriate than previous formulas which are modifications to the normal weir head-discharge equation. The accuracy of this equation was evaluated by different data sets including different inclined angle, side contractions, weir heights and also a wide discharge range. This equation could be used in the automated irrigation network easily...|$|R
