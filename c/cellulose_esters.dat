Cellulose from Oil Palm Empty Fruit Bunch (OPEFB) has a {{possibility}} {{to be converted}} into biodegradable plastic <b>cellulose</b> <b>ester</b> due to its huge availability. <b>Cellulose</b> <b>ester</b> has thermoplastic properties and is widely used in many polymer applications. This paper describes about esterification OPEFB cellulose with long chain fatty acid chloride in homogeneous system. Some different molar ratios of anhydroglucose unit (AGU) to fatty acid chloride were applied to observe <b>cellulose</b> <b>ester</b> with regards to weight increase percentage (%WIP), recovery yield (%RY) and degree of substitution (DS). Others characteristics were also determined, such as solubility and tensile strength of film casting (MPa). Cellulose palmitate, cellulose laurate and cellulose oleate were successfully produced from OPEFB cellulose. The study found {{that there is a}} correlation between type and molar ratio of fatty acid chloride. In an identical reaction condition, a longer fatty acid chlorides and a higher ratio molar AGU to fatty acid chloride produce <b>cellulose</b> <b>ester</b> with high WPI except <b>cellulose</b> oleate <b>ester...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. X-ray {{photoelectron}} spectroscopy (XPS) is {{a promising}} technique employed {{for the study}} of conducting polymers and their composites. XPS was used to study the surface chemistry of polyaniline-mixed <b>cellulose</b> <b>ester</b> (PANI-ME) composite membranes prepared by various chemical oxidative polymerization techniques such as insitu solution, vapour phase polymerizations and aniline polymerization using a two-compartment permeation cell. Hydrolytic degradation of surface deposited PANI and scission of cellulosic chains due to x-ray irradiation inside the XPS chamber influenced the quantification of polyaniline deposition levels as well as oxidation and doping states in PANI-ME membranes. N 1 s core level spectra allowed characterization of the PANI deposition level, its oxidation state and x-ray induced cellulosic ring cleavage. C 1 s and O 1 s core level spectra revealed PANI hydrolysis at the membrane surface. These degradation phenomena influence the performance of PANI composite membranes used specifically in electrodiffusion applications. It was shown that successful quantification of PANI deposition levels and its oxidation state on microporous mixed <b>cellulose</b> <b>ester</b> membranes using XPS could be realized by incorporating the degradation effects in the characterization results...|$|R

First, in five patients successively treated with cellulose acetate membranes of different areas, we found that increase of the area results in an increase in complement activation determined by C 3 a levels before and at 15 min of dialysis. The levels of leucopenia were similarly affected, and a significant correlation was found between complement activation and leucopenia (r = 0. 89, P less than 0. 05). When we compared the biocompatibility characteristics of a dialyser made of saponified <b>cellulose</b> <b>ester</b> with those of two dialysers made of cellulose acetate, we found that index of complement activation (18. 1 +/- 2 vs 9. 9 +/- 1. 1 and 11. 5 +/- 1. 1, P less than 0. 01) as well as index of leucopenia (69 +/- 4 vs 40 +/- 2 and 37 +/- 3, P less than 0. 001) were significantly higher on the saponified <b>cellulose</b> <b>ester</b> dialysers suggesting that hydroxyl groups of cellulosic membranes {{play an important role in}} the pathophysiology of dialysis-induced changes.

5000|$|Polymeric {{membranes}} {{lead the}} membrane separation industry market {{because they are}} very competitive in performance and economics. Many polymers are available, but the choice of membrane polymer is not a trivial task. A polymer has to have appropriate characteristics for the intended application. The polymer sometimes has to offer a low binding affinity for separated molecules (as {{in the case of}} biotechnology applications), and has to withstand the harsh cleaning conditions. It has to be compatible with chosen membrane fabrication technology. The polymer has to be a suitable membrane former in terms of its chains rigidity, chain interactions, stereoregularity, and polarity of its functional groups. The polymers can form amorphous and semicrystalline structures (can also have different glass transition temperatures), affecting the membrane performance characteristics. The polymer has to be obtainable and reasonably priced to comply with the low cost criteria of membrane separation process. Many membrane polymers are grafted, custom-modified, or produced as copolymers to improve their properties. The most common polymers in membrane synthesis are cellulose acetate, Nitrocellulose, and <b>cellulose</b> <b>esters</b> (CA, CN, and CE), polysulfone (PS), polyether sulfone(PES), polyacrilonitrile(PAN), polyamide, polyimide, polyethylene and polypropylene (PE and PP), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polyvinylchloride (PVC).|$|E

40|$|Water {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{fundamental}} natural resources in earth. The availability of clean water becomes a global interest. Many human activities result in water pollution. One from many pollution substances in water is phenol. Phenol is a very common residual compound in industrial activity. Extensive use of phenol in industry degrades water quality. Regulation has been set in many countries to prevent further damage to the water resource caused by phenol and limiting phenol concentration in water before released into the environment. Therefor it is importance to develop a sensor which can detect phenol concentration in water to be used as a wastewater quality control system. This paper presents a development of bacterial biosensor using Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas fluorescens as a biological sensitive material.

Porous membranes find use in the microfiltration, ultrafiltration, and dialysis applications. There is some controversy in defining a “membrane pore”. The most commonly used theory assumes a cylindrical pore for simplicity. This model assumes that pores have the shape of parallel, nonintersecting cylindrical capillaries. But in reality a typical pore is a random network of the unevenly shaped structures of different sizes. The formation of a pore can be induced by the dissolution of a [...] "better" [...] solvent into a [...] "poorer" [...] solvent in a polymer solution.

[...] The thicker porous membranes sometimes provide support for the thin dense membrane layers, forming the asymmetric membrane structures.

Hot-drawn CTA films show negative birefringence that decreases with increasing wavelength.
