5|$|Silicon nitride {{is often}} used as an {{insulator}} and <b>chemical</b> <b>barrier</b> in manufacturing integrated circuits, to electrically isolate different structures or as an etch mask in bulk micromachining. As a passivation layer for microchips, it is superior to silicon dioxide, {{as it is a}} significantly better diffusion barrier against water molecules and sodium ions, two major sources of corrosion and instability in microelectronics. It is also used as a dielectric between polysilicon layers in capacitors in analog chips.|$|E
5|$|Termites with {{colonies in}} close {{proximity}} to houses can extend their galleries underground and make mud tubes to enter homes. The insects keep out of sight and chew their way through structural and decorative timbers, leaving the surface layers intact, as well as through cardboard, plastic and insulation materials. Their presence may become apparent when winged insects appear and swarm in the home in spring. Control and extermination is a professional job involving trying to exclude the insects from the building and trying to kill those already present. Soil-applied liquid termiticides provide a <b>chemical</b> <b>barrier</b> that prevents termites from entering buildings, and lethal baits can be used; these are eaten by foraging insects, and carried back to the nest and shared {{with other members of the}} colony, which goes into slow decline.|$|E

25|$|The {{glial scar}} also {{prevents}} neuronal regrowth. Following {{trauma to the}} CNS, axons begin to sprout and attempt to extend across the injury site in order to repair the damaged regions. However, the scar prevents axonal extensions via physical and chemical means. Astrocytes form a dense network of gap junctions that generates a physical barrier to axonal regrowth. Further, the astrocytes secrete several growth-inhibitory molecules that chemically prevent axonal extensions. Moreover, the basal membrane component is expected to generate an additional physical and <b>chemical</b> <b>barrier</b> to axonal extensions.|$|E
25|$|The inner {{membrane}} is freely permeable only to oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water. It is {{much less}} permeable to ions and small molecules than the outer membrane, creating compartments by separating the matrix from the cytosolic environment. This compartmentalization is a necessary feature for metabolism. The inner mitochondrial membrane is both an electrical insulator and <b>chemical</b> <b>barrier.</b> Sophisticated ion transporters exist to allow speciﬁc molecules to cross this barrier. There are several antiport systems embedded in the inner membrane, allowing exchange of anions between the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix.|$|E
25|$|Thin-film {{deposition}} is {{a process}} applied in the semiconductor industry to grow electronic materials, in the aerospace industry to form thermal and <b>chemical</b> <b>barrier</b> coatings to protect surfaces against corrosive environments, in optics to impart the desired reflective and transmissive properties to a substrate and elsewhere in industry to modify surfaces to {{have a variety of}} desired properties. The deposition process can be broadly classified into physical vapor deposition (PVD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In CVD, the film growth takes place at high temperatures, leading to the formation of corrosive gaseous products, and it may leave impurities in the film. The PVD process can be carried out at lower deposition temperatures and without corrosive products, but deposition rates are typically lower. Electron-beam physical vapor deposition, however, yields a high deposition rate from 0.1 to 100 μm/min at relatively low substrate temperatures, with very high material utilization efficiency. The schematic of an EBPVD system is shown in Fig 1.|$|E

40|$|When {{cementitious}} {{materials are}} used for the containment of waste they act in two different, and sometimes conflicting, ways. The first is physical {{and the second is}} chemical containment in which the water passing through the barrier is buffered to high pH thereby substantially reducing the solubility of many harmful species and promoting sorption onto the matrix. <b>Chemical</b> <b>barriers</b> have been extensively researched for nuclear waste containment and this paper reports on the development of <b>chemical</b> <b>barriers</b> for the non-nuclear waste management. It focuses on the ability of a cementitious barrier to chemically condition liquid leachates, neutralising organic acids and reducing the solubility of priority pollutants. This is similar {{to the way in which}} cement suppresses actinide leaching in the disposal of nuclear wastes. In this paper, the results of an extensive preliminary investigation into potential mixes using various mineral wastes are presented and some of the measured properties are compared with those, which are required for a multi-layer barrier. The results indicate that many of these mixes are well suited to this application...|$|R

50|$|Although {{lignocellulose}} is {{the most}} abundant plant material resource, its usability is curtailed by its rigid structure. As a result, an effective pretreatment is needed to liberate the cellulose from the lignin seal and its crystalline structure so as to render it accessible for a subsequent hydrolysis step. By far, most pretreatments are done through physical or chemical means. To achieve higher efficiency, both physical and chemical pretreatments are required. Physical pretreatment is often called size reduction to reduce biomass physical size. Chemical pretreatment is to remove <b>chemical</b> <b>barriers</b> so the enzymes can have access to cellulose for microbial reactions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: To protect themselves, plants {{accumulate}} an armoury of antimicrobial secondary metabolites. Some metabolites represent constitutive <b>chemical</b> <b>barriers</b> to microbial attack (phytoanticipins) {{and others}} inducible antimicrobials (phytoalexins). They are extensively studied as promising plant and human disease-controlling agents. This review discusses the bioactivity of several phytoalexins and phytoanticipins defending plants against {{fungal and bacterial}} aggressors and those with antibacterial activities against pathogens affecting humans such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus involved in respiratory infections of cystic fibrosis patients. The utility of plant products as “antibiotic potentiators ” and “virulence attenuators ” is also described {{as well as some}} biotechnological applications in phytoprotection...|$|R

50|$|Ziram or zinc dimethyldithiocarbamate is {{primarily}} {{used as an}} agricultural fungicide to control and {{prevent the spread of}} fungal infections. It functions as a protectant fungicide, which means it remains active on the plant’s surface where it forms a <b>chemical</b> <b>barrier</b> between the plant and a fungus. A protectant fungicide is not absorbed into the plant and must be applied prior to infection. Ziram can either be directly sprayed on to a plant’s leaf or it {{can be used as a}} soil and seed treatment. The top five crops ziram is used on are: almonds, peaches, nectarines, pears, and table and raisin grapes.|$|E
50|$|The {{central nervous}} system is {{protected}} by major physical and <b>chemical</b> <b>barriers.</b> Physically, the brain and spinal cord are surrounded by tough meningeal membranes, and enclosed in {{the bones of the}} skull and spinal vertebrae, which combine to form a strong physical shield. Chemically, the brain and spinal cord are isolated by the so-called blood-brain barrier, which prevents most types of chemicals from moving from the bloodstream into the interior of the CNS. These protections make the CNS less susceptible in many ways than the PNS; the flip side, however, is that damage to the CNS tends to have more serious consequences.|$|R
50|$|Some {{flowers with}} both stamens and a pistil {{are capable of}} self-fertilization, which does {{increase}} the chance of producing seeds but limits genetic variation. The extreme case of self-fertilization occurs in flowers that always self-fertilize, such as many dandelions. Conversely, many species of plants have ways of preventing self-fertilization. Unisexual male and female flowers on the same plant may not appear or mature at the same time, or pollen from the same plant may be incapable of fertilizing its ovules. The latter flower types, which have <b>chemical</b> <b>barriers</b> to their own pollen, {{are referred to as}} self-sterile or self-incompatible.|$|R

Some mucins are associated with controlling mineralization, including nacre formation in mollusks, calcification in echinoderms and bone formation in vertebrates. They bind to pathogens {{as part of the}} immune system. Overexpression of the mucin proteins, especially MUC1, is associated with many types of cancer.|$|R
