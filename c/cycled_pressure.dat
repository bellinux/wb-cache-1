40|$|A {{new concept}} of a "fiber sorbent" has been investigated. The fiber sorbent is {{produced}} as a pseudo-monolithic material comprising polymer (cellulose acetate, CA) and zeolite (NaY) by applying hollow fiber spinning technology. Phase separation of the polymer solution provides an appropriately porous structure throughout the fiber matrix. In addition, the zeolite crystals are homogeneously dispersed in the polymer matrix with high loading. The zeolite is the main contributor to sorption capacity of the fiber sorbent. Mass transfer processes in the fiber sorbent module are analyzed for hydrogen recovery and compared with results for an equivalent size packed bed with identical diameter and length. The model indicates advantageous cases for application of fiber sorbent module over packed bed technology that allows system downsizing and energy saving by changing the outer and bore diameters to maintain or even reduce the pressure drop. The CA-NaY fiber sorbent was spun successfully with highly porous structure and high CO 2 sorption capacity. The fiber sorbent enables the shell-side void space for thermal moderation to heat of adsorption, while this {{cannot be applied to}} the packed bed. The poly(vinyl alcohol) coated CA-NaY demonstrated the thermal moderation with paraffin wax, which was carefully selected and melt at slightly above operating temperature, in the shell-side in a rapidly <b>cycled</b> <b>pressure</b> swing adsorption. So this new approach is attractive for some hydrogen recovery applications as an alternative to traditional zeolite pellets.

Dual-layer hollow fibers are created via dry-jet, wet-quench spinning with an inner "active" core of cellulose acetate (porous binder) and zeolite NaY (69 wt% zeolite NaY) and an external sheath layer of pure cellulose acetate. The co-spun sheath layer reduces the surface porosity of the fiber and {{was used as a}} smooth coating surface for a poly(vinyl-alcohol) post-treatment, which reduced the gas permeance through the fiber sorbent by at least 7 orders of magnitude, essentially creating an impermeable sheath layer. The interstitial volume between the individual fibers was filled with a thermally-moderating paraffin wax. CO 2 breakthrough experiments on the hollow fiber sorbent modules with and without paraffin wax revealed that the "passively" cooled paraffin wax module had 12. 5 % longer breakthrough times than the "non-isothermal" module. The latent heat of fusion/melting of the wax offsets the released latent heat of sorption/desorption of the zeolites. One-hundred rapidly <b>cycled</b> <b>pressure</b> swing adsorption cycles were performed on the "passively" cooled hollow fiber sorbents using 25 vol% CO 2 / 75 vol% He (H 2 surrogate) at 60 °C and 113 psia, resulting in a product purity of 99. 2 % and a product recovery of 88. 1 % thus achieving process conditions and product quality comparable to conventional pellet processes. Isothermal and non-isothermal dynamic modeling of the hollow fiber sorbent module and a traditional packed bed using gPROMS® indicated that the fiber sorbents have sharper fronts (232 % sharper) and longer adsorbate breakthrough times (66 % longer), further confirming the applicability of the new fiber sorbent approach for H 2 purification. © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

40|$|A Stirling cycle {{cryogenerator}} {{operates on}} a closed regenerative thermodynamic cycle with compression {{and expansion of}} the working fluid occurring at different temperature levels. Generally, hydrogen or helium {{is used as a}} single-component working fluid in the cryogenerators used for liquefaction of nitrogen. The use of a two-component working fluid, one condensing at the required refrigerating temperature, can improve the performance of the cryogenerator. If maximum <b>cycle</b> <b>pressure</b> in the cryogenerator is kept the same as when using a single-component working fluid, the pressure varies over a larger range. This provides an increase in the available refrigerating effect, but at a correspondingly higher input power. Thus, a particular cryogenerator can provide a larger liquefaction capacity when working with a two-component two-phase working fluid. Alternately, for a fixed liquefaction capacity, the maximum <b>cycle</b> <b>pressure</b> can be kept lower than the maximum <b>cycle</b> <b>pressure</b> with a single-component working fluid.

40|$|Thermo-acoustic {{analysis}} {{is crucial for}} a successful development of new gas turbine combustion systems. In this context, it {{becomes more and more}} necessary to predict the limit <b>cycle</b> <b>pressure</b> amplitude of thermo-acoustic combustion instabilities to figure out if they are within the critical design limit or will cause damage to the engine. For the prediction of limit <b>cycle</b> <b>pressure</b> amplitudes, the nonlinear flame response of the combustion system is needed, which is represented in this work by the Flame Describing Function (FDF). It is investigated if the limit cycle can be predicted using a combination of the FDF, which is calculated from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, and a low order thermoacoustic stability code. Two test cases are investigated. The first test case is a generic atmospheric swirl flame. The nonlinear saturation of the heat release response of the flame which was observed during measurements, was correctly captured by the CFD, meaning that the calculated and measured FDF showed good comparison. Next the FDF from CFD was used together with the low order thermo-acoustic stability code GIM to predict the limit <b>cycle</b> <b>pressure</b> amplitude. The frequency of the instability was predicted within 5 %, the pressure amplitude within 3. 3 dB. A sensitivity study, however, showed that small deviations between the measured and simulated FDF’s can lead to significant differences in the predicted limit <b>cycle</b> <b>pressure</b> amplitude. This shows that high fidelity CFD simulations are a must for these kinds of limit cycle predictions. Most limit cycle predictions presented in this work correspond well to the experimental data, indicating a good quality of the simulated FDF. The second test case corresponds to an industrial combustion system. The pressure amplitude is predicted within 4. 8 dB and the frequency within 6 %, compared to the measurements. An important design change was identified: {{it was found that the}} stability of the burner could be improved by shifting the location of the fuel injection downstream, towards the flame.

40|$|The {{supercritical}} {{carbon dioxide}} (S-CO₂) cycle is a promising advanced power conversion cycle which couples nicely to many Generation IV nuclear reactors. This work investigates the power conversion system design and proposes several "Third Generation" plant layouts for power ratings ranging between 20 and 1200 MWe for the recompression cycle. A 20 MWe simple cycle layout was also developed. The cycle designs are characterized by a dispersed component layout in which a single shaft turbomachinery train is coupled to parallel arrays of multiple printed circuit heat exchanger modules. This configuration has arrangement benefits in terms of modularity, inspectability, repairability and replaceability. Compared to the prior second generation dispersed layouts, its lower ductwork pressure drop confers approximately 2 % higher thermal efficiency. Two alternative S-CO₂ cycle designs for medium power applications were developed using an in-house optimization computer code and Solid Edge software. The first design is a recompression cycle derived from the 300 MWe design developed at MIT for Generation IV reactors. The design employs one turbine, two compressors (main and recompression) working in parallel and two recuperators (high and low temperature) and maximizes cycle efficiency while striving for a small plant footprint. The second design is a simple S-CO₂ power cycle, which has only one turbine, one compressor, and one recuperator. The main focus of the simple S-CO₂ design is cycle compactness and simplicity while achieving still attractive efficiency. Extensive sensitivity studies were performed for both the medium power recompression and simple S-CO₂ cycles to reveal areas for performance improvement, or performance degradation. Cycle efficiency is most sensitive to turbine inlet temperature. (cont.) Peak <b>cycle</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is also an important}} parameter affecting cycle efficiency, although to a smaller extent than turbine inlet temperature.
