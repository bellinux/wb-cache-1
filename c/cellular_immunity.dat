25|$|The {{immunochemistry}} of Triticeae glutens {{is important}} in several inflammatory diseases. It can be subdivided into innate responses (direct stimulation of immune system), class II mediated presentation (HLA DQ), class I meditiated stimulation of killer cells, and antibody recognition. The responses to gluten proteins and polypeptide regions differs according {{to the type of}} gluten sensitivity. The response is also dependent on the genetic makeup of the human leukocyte antigen genes. In gluten sensitive enteropathy, there are 4 types of recognition, innate immunity (a form of <b>cellular</b> <b>immunity</b> priming), HLA-DQ, and antibody recognition of gliadin and transglutaminase. With idiopathic gluten sensitivity only antibody recognition to gliadin has been resolved. In wheat allergy, the response pathways are mediated through IgE against other wheat proteins and other forms of gliadin.|$|E
40|$|Enterovirus 71 (EV 71) {{is one of}} the 69 enteroviruses {{belonging}} to the picornavirus family. We have previously generated a recombinant baculovirus encoding P 1 and 3 CD genes for co-expressing P 1 and 3 CD proteins for VLP assembly in insect cells. In this study, we further characterized the VLP after ultracentrifugation purification, and evaluated the immunological properties of VLPs in Balb/c mice. The immunization experiments show that the VLP induced stronger anti-VP 1 antibody titer and neutralization titers compared to the inactivated EV 71 virus and lysed VLP. The antibodies induced by EV 71 VLP were also capable of neutralizing live EV 71 of different strains. Moreover, the VLP was able to induce <b>cellular</b> <b>immunities</b> as judged by helper T cell proliferation assay and cytokine assay. These data collectively confirmed that EV 71 VLP produced from baculovirus/insect cells is able to elicit humoral and <b>cellular</b> <b>immunities</b> in mice, implicating its potentials as a vaccine against EV 71 infection...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{vaccines}} induce humoral {{and cellular}} immune responses in animal models and humans. To analyze the immunogenicity of the {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV, spike DNA vaccine and the immunoregulatory activity of interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), DNA vaccine plasmids pcDNA-S and pcDNA-IL- 2 were constructed and inoculated into BALB/c mice {{with or without}} pcDNA-IL- 2 by using three different immunization routes (the intramuscular route, electroporation, or the oral route with live attenuated Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium). The cellular and humoral immune responses were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, lymphocyte proliferation assays, enzyme-linked immunospot assays, and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses. The results showed that specific humoral and <b>cellular</b> <b>immunities</b> could be induced in mice by inoculating them with SARS-CoV spike DNA vaccine alone or by coinoculation with IL- 2 -expressing plasmids. In addition, the immune response levels in the coinoculation groups were significantly higher than those in groups receiving the spike DNA vaccine alone. The comparison between the three vaccination routes indicated that oral vaccination evoked a vigorous T-cell response and a weak response predominantly with subclass immunoglobulin G 2 a (IgG 2 a) antibody. However, intramuscular immunization evoked a vigorous antibody response and a weak T-cell response, and vaccination by electroporation evoked a vigorous response with a predominant subclass IgG 1 antibody response and a moderate T-cell response. Our findings show that the spike DNA vaccine has good immunogenicity and can induce specific humoral and <b>cellular</b> <b>immunities</b> in BALB/c mice, while IL- 2 plays an immunoadjuvant role and enhances the humoral and cellular immune responses. Different vaccination routes also evoke distinct immune responses. This study provides basic information for the design of DNA vaccines against SARS-CoV...|$|R

2500|$|Interference by nontuberculous mycobacteria: Exposure to {{environmental}} mycobacteria (especially M. avium, M. marinum and M. intracellulare) {{results in a}} nonspecific immune response against mycobacteria. [...] Administering BCG to someone who already has a nonspecific immune response against mycobacteria does not augment the response already there. [...] BCG will therefore appear not to be efficacious, because that person already has a level of immunity and BCG is not adding to that immunity. [...] This effect is called masking, because the effect of BCG is masked by environmental mycobacteria. [...] Clinical evidence for this effect {{was found in a}} series of studies performed in parallel in adolescent school children in the UK and Malawi. [...] In this study, the UK school children had a low baseline <b>cellular</b> <b>immunity</b> to mycobacteria which was increased by BCG; in contrast, the Malawi school children had a high baseline <b>cellular</b> <b>immunity</b> to mycobacteria and this was not significantly increased by BCG. [...] Whether this natural immune response is protective is not known. [...] An alternative explanation is suggested by mouse studies; immunity against mycobacteria stops BCG from replicating and so stops it from producing an immune response. [...] This is called the block hypothesis.|$|E

40|$|Parasites vary {{geographically}} and dispersing host {{individuals may}} encounter different strains and wider varieties than their philopatric counterparts. Previously observed lower parasite counts in philopatric than dispersing birds {{have been suggested}} {{to be the result}} of local adaptation to parasites, but I suggest an alternative: these patterns may result from differing immune function. I used genetic assignment tests to infer natal philopatry of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia), and tested whether this predicted parasitism and innate and adaptive immune function. I found no relationship between parasitism and philopatry, in contrast to previous findings. In females, philopatry was associated with higher <b>cellular</b> innate <b>immunity</b> and lower humoral innate immunity. I also detected a negative relationship between measures of <b>cellular</b> adaptive <b>immunity</b> and humoral innate immunity. These results suggest a sex-specific, philopatry-mediated immune tradeoff that occurs along the cellular-humoral axis, rather than the innate-adaptive axis traditionally focused on in ecophysiological life history...|$|R
40|$|Toxoplasmosis {{is known}} as {{zoonotic}} disease caused by Toxoplasma gondii infection. This microorganism has ability to evade immune system by forming parasitophorus vacuole (PV) formed through the phagosome vacuole modification by secreting dense granule protein (GRA). Among GRAs protein, GRA 1 was selected as candidate for vaccine development. However, it remains controvercial whether the protein has adequate antigenicity and strong immunogenicity which are suitable for vaccine candidate. Some researcher reported that DNA vaccine of GRA 1 was able to induce <b>cellular</b> mediated <b>immunity</b> and proinflamatoric humoral immunity. In fact, another study demonstrated that GRA 1 protein was only antigenic based on their molecular weight and bioinformatic analysis. The other studies also showed that GRA 1 was considered as weak immunogen based on bioinformatic studies.

2500|$|MHC class I {{occurs on}} all {{nucleated}} cells {{and also in}} platelets—in essence all cells but red blood cells. It presents epitopes to killer T cells, also called cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). [...] A CTL expresses CD8 receptors, in addition to TCRs. When a CTL's CD8 receptor docks to a MHC class I molecule, if the CTL's TCR fits the epitope within the MHC class I molecule, the CTL triggers the cell to undergo programmed cell death by apoptosis. [...] Thus, MHC class I helps mediate <b>cellular</b> <b>immunity,</b> a primary means to address intracellular pathogens, such as viruses and some bacteria, including bacterial L forms, bacterial genus Mycoplasma, and bacterial genus Rickettsia. In humans, MHC class I comprises HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C molecules.|$|E

40|$|For {{protection}} from HIV- 1 infection, a vaccine should elicit both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. A novel vaccine regimen and adjuvant that induce {{high levels of}} HIV- 1 Env-specific T cell and antibody (Ab) responses was developed in this study. The prime-boost regimen that used combinations of replication-competent vaccinia LC 16 m 8 D (m 8 D) and Sendai virus (SeV) vectors expressing HIV- 1 Env efficiently produced both Env-specific CD 8 + T cells and anti-Env antibodies, including neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). These results sharply contrast with vaccine regimens that prime with an Env expressing plasmid and boost with the m 8 D or SeV vector that mainly elicited <b>cellular</b> <b>immunities.</b> Moreover, co-priming with combinations of m 8 Ds expressing Env or a membrane-bound human CD 40 ligand mutant (CD 40 Lm) enhanced Env-specific CD 8 + T cell production, but not anti-Env antibody production.

Our previous {{study found that}} THL can modulate the antigen-stimulated proliferative response of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} and T-cells isolated from RAU patients. In this study, we further tested whether THL can modulate the antigen-stimulated cytokine production by T-cells isolated from RAU patients.

40|$|The surface {{envelope}} protein of hepatitis B virus (HBsAg) stimulates {{the immune system}} to produce anti-HBs antibodies and to generate cell-mediated immunity. These two arms of immunity {{were found to be}} regulated differently in bm 12 (H- 2 bm 12) or CBA and C 3 H (H- 2 k) mice. In bm 12 mutant (I-A beta mutant of B 6 mice) mice, the anti-HBs production, early-type, and immune complex-type hypersensitivity were impaired, but the delayed-type hypersensitivity and the T-cell proliferation in vitro were normal compared to the parental B 6 (H- 2 b) mice. The mutation of the A beta molecule seems to affect the immune responses differentially. On the other hand, C 3 H or CBA mice produced anti-HBs antibodies after major S protein (pre-S-depleted HBsAg) stimulation, but could not generate the hypersensitivity responses. The pre-S region could circumvent the non-responsiveness of the hypersensitivity response in C 3 H and CBA mice.
