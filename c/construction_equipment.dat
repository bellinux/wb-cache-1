40|$|Abstract. Design {{methods of}} {{electric}} motors and reasonable parametric design principles for hybrid electric <b>construction</b> <b>equipments</b> are proposed. In {{accordance with the}} power performance, economical efficiency and electric transmission features of <b>construction</b> <b>equipments,</b> the new design method of electric motors which is an advanced application-centric design process are analyzed, and the design theory and calculation method of main parameters are discussed, so that theoretical basis is provided for the research and design of new electric drive <b>construction</b> <b>equipments.</b> Parametric design of a typical dozer drive train is conducted applied the proposed new design method and calculation method. Major components of the power train are modeled using the simulation software Simulink. Based on power track control strategy, the simulation {{results show that the}} proposed new design method and parameter design theory of electric motors for hybrid <b>construction</b> <b>equipments</b> are reasonable. It has significance in both theory and practice for the research and development of hybrid electric drive <b>construction</b> <b>equipments...</b>|$|R

5|$|In March 1989, {{the first}} buses {{were tested in}} the tunnel; University Street station was only 75 percent complete, and buses had to drive under {{scaffolding}} and <b>construction</b> <b>equipment</b> while passing through the station. Tunnel construction was completed in June 1990, and a soft opening for University Street station was held on August 9, 1990. Bus service in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel began on September 15, 1990, with several Metro bus routes moved into the tunnel from surface streets. All service on routes using the tunnel was operated by dual-mode buses, which operated as diesel buses outside the tunnel and electrically, as trolleybuses, when inside the tunnel. During its early months, University Street and other stations were affected by serious water leaks, which splashed water onto walkways during the tunnel's first winter in operation. The leaks were later fixed by Metro contractors.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941, General Douglas MacArthur {{requested}} Casey's {{services as}} his chief engineer. Casey arrived in Manila in October, {{shortly before the}} outbreak of war between the United States and Japan. He acquired <b>construction</b> <b>equipment</b> from the National Power Corporation that was being used on the Caliraya project. Casey supervised demolitions as MacArthur's troops retreated to Bataan, {{for which he was}} awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Unlike the rest of MacArthur's headquarters, Casey, who was promoted to colonel on 19 December 1941 and brigadier general on 25 January 1942, did not relocate to Corregidor but remained on Bataan with a small staff of five officers. However, he joined MacArthur and sixteen other members of his staff in their escape from Corregidor by PT boat in March 1942. For his service in the 1942 campaign in the Philippines, he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} months in New Guinea, Whitehead {{concentrated}} on {{building up the}} infrastructure there. He obtained additional engineer units and <b>construction</b> <b>equipment.</b> New airfields were developed, along with roads, housing, taxiways and revetments to protect his aircraft from the frequent Japanese air raids. He also attempted {{to build up the}} morale and leadership of his units. These months coincided with the Kokoda Track campaign. For a time, despite the efforts of his airmen and the ground troops, the Japanese advanced steadily on Port Moresby, but they ultimately turned back short of it. For his part in the Papuan campaign, Whitehead was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. The Australian government made him an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Selecting {{the correct}} {{equipment}} is a multifaceted cost and benefit evaluation process {{due to the}} complexity of todayâ€™s construction projects and lack of considerations of all factors. Based on the analysis of traditional influence factors on the selection of <b>construction</b> <b>equipments,</b> carbon emission constraints were introduced to facilitate green construction. These factors were divided into three categories, which are certain factors, soft factors and carbon emission constraints, based on their own characteristics. By the classification of the factors, their impact on the selection of the <b>construction</b> <b>equipments</b> was studied in detail, especially the carbon emission constraints was investigated from three aspects: relationship between the emissions of CO 2 and fuel consumption, standard and regulations of CO 2 and carbon tax. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to find the main influence factors and provide a basic theoretical reference to the selection of <b>construction</b> <b>equipments</b> for decision-makers...|$|R

5|$|It was a {{daunting}} challenge. The Ho Chi Minh Trail (controlled by the 259th PAVN Logistical Group) {{consisted of a}} labyrinth of dirt roads, bicycle and foot paths, bypasses, storage areas, workshops, and truck parks that stretched from the mountain passes of North Vietnam, through the panhandle of Laos, and into east central Cambodia. The entire system was elaborately camouflaged from aerial observation and was constantly being maintained, expanded, and improved. By 1968 PAVN was relying less on manual labor and increasingly utilizing modern <b>construction</b> <b>equipment.</b> The CIA estimated during the year the 259th Group was using 20 bulldozers, eleven road graders, three rock crushers and two steamrollers on the network. Manual labor was still provided by an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 Laotians (mostly pressed into service) and North Vietnamese volunteers.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Johns became commandant of the Engineer School at Fort Belvoir. The wartime Engineer School was {{responsible}} for the training of officers. Some were engineers in civilian life who were trained as officers; other were officers transferred from other arms who were given training in engineering subjects. The Officer Candidate School (OCS) prepared enlisted men for commissioning as officers. There had been strong criticism of the content of training courses from SWPA, where it was the norm for machinery to be operated around the clock and for engineer officers to supervise all manner of construction tasks. The commanders there felt that the training courses taught by the Engineer School were concentrating too much on leadership in combat, and not enough on technical matters, such the operation and maintenance of <b>construction</b> <b>equipment.</b> Johns reformed the curriculum, but by this time {{it was too late for}} the changes to have much effect in the overseas theaters of operations. For his work at Fort Belvoir, Johns was awarded the Legion of Merit.|$|E
5|$|The ten {{pre-production}} gliders {{were eventually}} {{delivered by the}} end of 1942, and the first production glider was put together between March and April 1943. Production of parts and the building of complete gliders continued throughout 1943, but production schedules continued to fall behind, particularly when the United States Army Air Forces became interested in the glider, requiring a significant number to be completed for Operation Overlord, the airborne landings in Normandy, and a number of others {{to be used in the}} Far East. This placed further pressure on GAL and the Hamilcar Production Group, as the USAAF demands would require further production and new flight trials to see if the glider would operate effectively in a tropical climate. In late 1943 the USAAF required 140 Hamilcars, which would be used to transport bulldozers and other <b>construction</b> <b>equipment</b> for airfield building, and in November it was agreed that 50 would be supplied to them by June 1944. However, the continued slow production of the gliders so concerned the USAAF that it cancelled its requirement in February 1944; this meant that American personnel who had been helping with the production of the gliders were withdrawn and production times were further delayed. It also meant that only British airborne forces would use the Hamilcar. By January 1944 only 27 Hamilcars had been erected and were ready for use; a total of 53 had been produced, but the rest were in storage awaiting parts to complete them or to be erected. Finding personnel to erect the gliders, and airfields to store them, continued to be a problem. By June, however, eighty of the gliders had been manufactured and erected and were ready for use in airborne operations, in time for a small number to be used during Operation Tonga, the British airborne landings in Normandy. Production continued throughout the conflict and finally ended in 1946, with a total of 344 being produced.|$|E
