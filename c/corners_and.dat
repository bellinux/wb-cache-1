5|$|A roadway {{was present}} along parts of today's H-58 {{by the late}} 1920s; initially, this county road was gravel or earth between Munising and Kingston <b>Corners</b> <b>and</b> {{connected}} with other roads to Grand Marais. In the 1930s, another segment was built to connect to Deer Park and {{to fill in the}} gap between Kingston <b>Corners</b> <b>and</b> Grand Marais. The southwestern segment between Munising and Van Meer formed part of M-94 from 1929 until it was transferred back to county control in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|NY12D was {{originally}} assigned {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to most of what is now NY12 between Boonville and Lowville. The alignments of both routes between the two locations were swapped , placing NY12D on its current alignment from Boonville to Potters Corners (in the Town of West Turin) and on NY26 between Potters <b>Corners</b> <b>and</b> Lowville. The overlap between NY12D and NY26 remained in place until the 1970s when NY12D was realigned onto its current routing between Potters <b>Corners</b> <b>and</b> Lyons Falls, replacing then-New York State Route337.|$|E

5|$|During the Late Preclassic {{structures}} were built using volcanic stone {{held together with}} clay, as in the Middle Preclassic. However, they evolved to include stepped structures with indented <b>corners</b> <b>and</b> stairways dressed with rounded pebbles. At the same time, old Olmec-style sculptures were moved from their original positions and {{placed in front of}} the new-style buildings, sometimes reusing sculpture fragments in the stone facing.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Holden won {{the design}} {{competition}} for an extension to the Bristol Royal Infirmary. Subsequently {{dedicated to the}} memory of King Edward VII (died 1910), the extension (1911–12) was built on steeply sloping ground for which Holden designed a linked pair of Portland stone-faced blocks around a courtyard. The plain, abstract blocks have towers on the <b>corners</b> <b>and</b> two-storey loggias, and are a further simplification of Holden's style.|$|E

5|$|New York State Route83 (NY83) {{is a state}} route located {{entirely in}} Chautauqua County, New York in the United States. It extends from an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route62 (US62) in the hamlet of Conewango Valley (at the Cattaraugus County border) to NY60 in the hamlet of Laona, near Fredonia. Along the way, NY83 intersects with NY322 at Balcom <b>Corners</b> <b>and</b> serves the village of Cherry Creek.|$|E
5|$|Samaras {{has been}} {{described}} as having all the skills necessary for forward play. His height, , makes him difficult to handle in the air – and he is also a good header of the ball. This means he can be used as an effective target man and his team can hit long balls up to him. He can also score from <b>corners</b> <b>and</b> crosses. Samaras is also strong which further adds to his physical presence and makes him harder for defenders to play against.|$|E

In Vassar, M-15 intersects and turns northwest along Huron Avenue, a historical routing of M-24, crossing the Cass River in town. Outside Vassar, Huron Avenue becomes Saginaw Road. In western Tuscola County, M-15 intersects M-46 {{in the community}} of Richville.

5|$|The most similar European thrush {{species is}} the redwing (T. iliacus), but that bird {{has a strong}} white supercilium, red flanks, and shows a red underwing in flight. The mistle thrush (T. viscivorus) is much larger and has white tail <b>corners,</b> <b>and</b> the Chinese thrush (T. mupinensis), {{although}} much more similar in plumage, has black face markings and does not overlap in range.|$|E
5|$|The nervous shark has {{a rather}} stout, {{spindle-shaped}} {{body and a}} short, broadly rounded snout. The anterior margin of each nostril is extended into a slender nipple-shaped lobe. The moderately large eyes are horizontally oval in shape and equipped with nictitating membranes. The mouth lacks conspicuous furrows at the <b>corners</b> <b>and</b> contains 25–30 upper and 23–28 lower tooth rows. The upper teeth are narrow and angled, with coarsely serrated edges. The lower teeth are more slender and upright in shape, and have finer serrations. The five pairs of gill slits are medium in length.|$|E
5|$|The pelagic {{stingray}} {{has a very}} thick, distinctively wedge-shaped pectoral fin disc one-third wider than long, with broadly curved leading margins, rather angular outer <b>corners,</b> <b>and</b> nearly straight trailing margins. The snout is short with a rounded tip. The eyes are minute and, unlike in other stingrays, do not protrude above the body; the spiracles (paired respiratory openings) follow immediate behind. There is a short but broad curtain of skin between the nostrils, with a weakly fringed rear margin. The mouth is small and gently arched, with deep furrows at the <b>corners</b> <b>and</b> a tiny projection {{at the center of}} the upper jaw that fits into an indentation on the lower jaw. There are anywhere from 0 to 15 forked papillae (nipple-like structures) in a row across the floor of the mouth. There are 2534 upper tooth rows and 2531 lower tooth rows; the teeth of both sexes have single, pointed cusps, but those of adult males are longer and sharper than those of adult females. The margins of the pelvic fins are nearly straight in front and become rounded at the tips and in back.|$|E

5|$|Traffic {{patterns}} quickly {{shifted to}} take advantage of the new crossing and the bypass of Niagara Falls that it provided. In foresight of this, the Department of Public Highways took control of a Welland County road between Chambers <b>Corners</b> <b>and</b> Fort Erie on May11, 1927. This roadway, which followed a significant portion of Sherk's Road and the Garrison Road, in addition to a concession road built west from Port Colborne and north through Wainfleet village, was designated as Highway3A.|$|E
5|$|Yet another Thayer printrun {{was needed}} in early 1853. Thayer {{was about to}} leave his Boston {{business}} for the final time, but finished the job for the Ives firm.

5|$|Damage was {{confined}} to Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and south-central Iowa, and largely consisted of fallen chimneys, foundation cracks, collapsed parapets, and overturned tombstones. In one home in Dale, Illinois, near Tuckers <b>Corners</b> <b>and</b> southwest of McLeansboro, the quake cracked interior walls, plaster, and chimneys. Using a type of victim study, the local post office surveyed residents and implemented a field inspection which indicated the strongest shaking (MM VII) {{took place in the}} Wabash Valley, Ohio Valley, and other nearby south-central Illinois lowlands. Outside this four-state zone, oscillating objects including cars, chimneys, and the Gateway Arch were reported to authorities.|$|E
5|$|Following on {{from the}} success of their debut album, they {{released}} Talk on <b>Corners</b> <b>and</b> In Blue in 1997 and 2000 respectively.

In Blue moved towards mainstream pop, placing heavy emphasis on electronic synthesisers. It was successful, and was No. 1 in its first sales week in the UK, Ireland, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria and debuted at No. 2 in France and Norway. It climbed to the top position during its second week in Sweden and Spain.|$|E
5|$|Further {{north in}} Lysander, NY48 crosses the CSX Transportation-owned Baldwinsville Subdivision {{before turning to}} the {{northeast}} as it passes through the hamlet of Wrights <b>Corners</b> <b>and</b> entering Oswego County. Just past the county line in Granby, the route turns northwest, following the western bank the Oswego River (and paralleling County Route57 or CR57 on the opposite side) as it intersects CR46 near the hamlet of Hinmansville. NY48 continues along the riverbank {{to the city of}} Fulton, where it gains the name West First Street south of an intersection with NY176. Like NY31 in Baldwinsville, NY48 originally overlapped NY176 north to NY3 (Broadway), where NY176 continued east. Now, however, NY176 ends here and NY48 continues solo to NY3. Past Broadway, NY48 proceeds north through the remainder of Fulton, now paralleling NY481 extremely close with just Oswego River separating the two.|$|E
