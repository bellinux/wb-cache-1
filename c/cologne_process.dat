The aim of this procedure is that identical sounding words have the same code assigned to them. The algorithm {{can be used to}} perform a similarity search between words. For example, it is possible in a name list to find entries like [...] "Meier" [...] under different spellings such as [...] "Maier", [...] "Mayer", or [...] "Mayr". The Cologne phonetics is related to the well known Soundex phonetic algorithm but is optimized to match the German language. The algorithm was published in 1969 by Hans Joachim Postel.|$|E
40|$|The {{coordination}} {{of the economic}} policies of the EU Member countries started in the early 90 ´ s has become a permanent feature of the European integration process. Gradually a rather complicated mechanism has evolved aiming to combine and complement policies pursued at EU level with policies conducted at Member countries level. In the paper the legal framework of the economic policy coordination is presented, main instruments and methods described and assessed. Among the instruments discussed {{attention is paid to}} the Main Economic Policy Guidelines, Employment Guidelines, Cardiff process, <b>Cologne</b> <b>process,</b> Lisbon process and the Stability and Growth Pact. All these instruments have something in common : they are based on consensus and include recommendations to the Member states, which, however, cannot be enforced, except for the fiscal policy framework. The Stability and Growth Pact is the only instrument making it legally possible putting sanctions against a non-complying country, non-respecting the rules of the Pact. As yet the Community does not possess any mechanism securing that the Member countries follow the recommended reforms. The main contribution of the economic policy coordination can be found in that it supports the mutual learning process. monetary policy; fiscal policy; {{coordination of}} economic policies...|$|E
40|$|Introduction by Mark A. Pollack, series editor]. THE PORTUGUESE PRESIDENCY, WHICH {{organized}} {{the work of}} the Council during {{the first six months of}} the year, was tasked with the heavy responsibility of organizing the opening months of the 2000 IGC (see Dinan and Vanhoonacker, this issue), yet the Portuguese also embarked on a major campaign to sponsor an academic and political debate on economic reform, and on the future of European economic governance. Throughout their presidency, the Portuguese sought to stimulate a debate on both the substance and process of European economic policymaking, proposing a "new strategic goal for the Union in order to strengthen employment, economic reform and social cohesion as part of a knowledge-based economy. " Toward this end, the presidency commissioned a series of papers from both distinguished academics and EU institutions on subjects ranging from employment policy to the reform of the welfare state, modernization of public services, social inclusion, and the information society and e-commerce (for an on-line listing and texts of these reports, see Portuguese Presidency 2000). In March, the presidency organized a special European Council, which largely endorsed the Portuguese program of economic reform, with particularly detailed statements on the information society and the promotion of e-commerce. As important as the substance of the proposed reforms, however, is the process proposed by the Portuguese presidency, and endorsed by the Lisbon European Council, dubbed "open coordination. " As Jim Mosher explains below, open coordination involves the establishment of common social policy guidelines, indicators and "benchmarks," which are intended to guide national policies through a process of policy coordination and peer evaluation. Although the practice of open coordination is not itself new, having been pioneered in recent years in a trio of joint policy processes (namely the Luxembourg Process on employment, the Cardiff process on structural reforms, and the <b>Cologne</b> <b>process</b> on macroeconomic policy coordination), the explicit endorsement of open coordination in Lisbon raises a number of important questions about the future of European economic governance, which are addressed by three ECSA members in this Forum. In the first essay, Martin Rhodes analyzes the outcome of the Lisbon European Council as a pragmatic effort by the EU to find a "Third Way" between the traditionally conflicting imperatives of economic efficiency and equality, and between the extremes of European harmonization and national autonomy. In the process, he suggests, the presidency has created a "new European architecture for social policy" which will rationalize existing processes under the umbrella of a broader economic strategy and an annual Spring meeting of the European Council. In the second essay, Janine Goetschy looks back at the record of open coordination in the most developed of the three current processes, the European Employment Strategy, noting both the strengths and the weaknesses of the process during its formative years. In the third and final essay, Jim Mosher places the emerging process of open coordination in the context of a broader move to "post-regulatory governance," which promises both functional and political advantages to member governments eager to cooperate in a flexible fashion, but also the familiar dangers of "voluntarism" and weak or uneven national implementation of common EU goals. Despite differences in emphasis and in levels of optimism about the future, all three essays echo Rhodes' conclusion that the Lisbon European Council is likely to emerge as a watershed in EU social policy, in terms of both the articulation of a new set of common policy goals for the member states, and the endorsement of new policy processes which may-or may not-serve to facilitate the achievement of those goals in the coming years...|$|E

In EMU, the method arose out of a specific policy framework with a common monetary policy complemented by the coordination of national economic policies. The recent recommendation issued against Ireland is the first example of the operation of the method in EMU and shows how debate can be stimulated and how different and arguably equally valid perspectives defended. The particular experience of EMU with a sound money, sound finance paradigm, a long history of project-building by key elites and the central role of the European Council suggest similar conditions are required for the effective application of the method in other policy spheres. The context within which the method has operated to date is contingent and could change either over time or between policy fields. If so, the very openness of the method may serve to reconfigure the boundaries of competence between the Member States and the Union, after all...|$|R

40|$|The Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) is an {{economic}} and monetary policy system based on a fundamental asymmetry and consisting of three elements: 1. an independent central bank (ECB) which is exclusively charged with monetary policy in the euro zone; 2. economic policies (fiscal and budgetary policies) which continue to be pursued individually at member state level but which are subject to specified common rules (specifically the stability and growth pact (SGP), the procedure {{in the case of}} an excessive deficit and the acquis communautaire of the single market); and, finally, 3. recognition that economic policies by the member states are a matter of "common concern" which consequently need some amount of co-ordination at Council level. The ECB pursues its monetary policy at central level for all members of the euro zone. Its primary objective is to achieve price stability in the euro zone. In its monetary policy strategy, the ECB concentrates on three key elements: a quantitative definition of price stability as the chief goal of the euro system (defined by the ECB as an inflation rate of not more than 2 percent), and a "two-pillar concept". For the "first pillar", a reference value of 4. 5 percent was specified for the growth of the money supply (M 3). The "second pillar" includes a whole bundle of business indicators in order to obtain adequate forecasts of inflation. In spite of an unfavourable international situation (oil price shock of 2000 - 01, global recession in 2001 - 02), the ECB was successful in shaping its monetary policy. EMU has not only revolutionised monetary policy but has also left a marked impression on the fiscal stability culture in the EU. The obligation to meet the convergence criteria alone has already reduced budget deficits in the EU markedly below 3 percent of GDP. With the entry into the third stage of EMU, the trend was further enhanced, not least due to the dictates of the stability and growth pact. Whereas in 1997 (prior to EMU entry) only three of the 15 EU member states (Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg) boasted of a budget surplus, their number had grown to nine countries in 2001. This not only interrupted the dynamic growth of the national debt but also contributed to making state finances more sustainable. But although the stability and growth pact fostered greater fiscal policy discipline, it still shows its inherent weaknesses in times of weak growth or recession. With competences clearly allocated (ECB exclusively in charge of monetary policy and EU member states in charge of economic policy), economic policy needs to be co-ordinated. Over time, complex mechanisms and a number of processes have been established (Luxembourg process for employment, Cardiff process for structural policy and functioning of the single market, <b>Cologne</b> <b>process</b> for macroeconomic dialogue, Lisbon process for an open method of co-ordination). An annual rhythm of multilateral monitoring has been formed within the scope of the pact, accompanied by the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines (BEPG). It is an open issue whether this elaborate (administrative, political) process does not already cancel out possible gains of co-ordination. In view of such findings, any demand for further and stronger co-ordination made (e. g. by the Commission) to the European Convention currently discussing the future Europe would thus be rather contra productive. It is especially in comparing the USA and EU in terms of their economic performance over the past decade that an analysis of the complex economic policy interactions within EMU may well lead to the conclusion that not only are labour and capital markets in the EU still too rigid but that its economic policy is still too inflexible.
