5|$|Living Hydrogenophilus thermoluteolus {{micro-organisms}} {{have been}} found in Lake Vostok's deep ice core drillings; they are an extant surface-dwelling species. This suggests the presence of a deep biosphere utilizing a geothermal system of the bedrock encircling the subglacial lake. There is optimism that microbial life in the lake may be possible despite high pressure, constant <b>cold,</b> <b>low</b> nutrient input, potentially high oxygen concentration and an absence of sunlight. Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus may also harbor lakes or oceans below a thick crust of ice.

5|$|Tropical Storm Debra was {{the second}} of two {{tropical}} storms to hit the United States in the 1978 Atlantic hurricane season. The fourth named storm of the season, Debra developed from the interaction between a high-altitude <b>cold</b> <b>low</b> and a lower tropical wave in the Gulf of Mexico. Forming on August 25, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Debra {{based on data from}} a Hurricane Hunter aircraft. As Debra approached the coast, it attained peak winds of 60mph (95km/h). The storm made landfall on the coast of Louisiana, east of the Texas border. Two deaths were caused by the storm. Debra weakened as it moved inland and ultimately dissipated on August29 over Arkansas.|$|E

Marco headed towards Florida, and remained just offshore of the western coast and nearly made landfall near St. Petersburg, Florida on October 12. However, Marco continued to interact with land, and weakened to a tropical depression before actually making landfall near Cedar Key, Florida with winds of 35mph (55km/h). It rapidly weakened over land, and dissipated in Georgia later that day. Although it had dissipated, Marco added to the heavy rainfall already brought to the southeastern states by the remnants Hurricane Klaus.|$|E

5|$|The system {{originated}} {{out of a}} non-tropical cold-core {{upper level}} low that drifted southward into the subtropics. The low interacted with a cold front, {{which resulted in the}} development of a stationary front over the Bahamas on October10. As the <b>cold</b> <b>low</b> drifted southward, a surface low developed on October12. The surface low remained mostly stationary until early on October15 as it merged with the upper-level low and deepened while north of the Bahamas and east of the coast of Florida. Later that day, the system gained enough tropical characteristics and became organized enough to be classified as a subtropical depression. The storm remained stationary over warm water, with sea surface temperatures around , while it continued to gain additional tropical characteristics. Around 0000 UTC on October16, it strengthened into a subtropical storm after satellite classifications showed a stronger storm. Later that day, the cyclone continued to develop as more thunderstorms formed and persisted near the low-level circulation.|$|E

50|$|A {{tropical}} upper tropospheric trough (TUTT), {{also known}} as the mid-oceanic trough, is a trough situated in upper-level (at about 200 hPa) tropics. Its formation is usually caused by the intrusion of energy and wind from the mid-latitudes into the tropics. It can also develop from the inverted trough adjacent to an upper level anticyclone. TUTTs are different from mid-latitude troughs {{in the sense that they}} are maintained by subsidence warming near the tropopause which balances radiational cooling. When strong, they can present a significant vertical wind shear to the tropics and subdue tropical cyclogenesis. When upper <b>cold</b> <b>lows</b> break off from their base, they tend to retrograde and force the development, or enhance, surface troughs and tropical waves to their east. Under special circumstances, they can induce thunderstorm activity and lead to the formation of tropical cyclones.|$|R
50|$|Under {{specific}} circumstances, upper <b>cold</b> <b>lows</b> {{can break}} {{off from the}} base of the TUTT. These upper tropospheric cyclonic vortices usually move slowly from east-northeast to west-southwest, and generally do not extend below 20,000 feet in altitude. A weak inverted wave in the easterlies is generally found underneath them, and they may also be associated with broad areas of high-level clouds. Downward development results in an increase of cumulus clouds and the appearance of a surface vortex. In rare cases, they become warm-core, resulting in the vortex becoming a tropical cyclone. Upper cyclones and upper troughs which trail tropical cyclones can cause additional outflow channels and aid in their intensification process. Developing tropical disturbances can help create or deepen upper troughs or upper lows in their wake due to the outflow jet emanating from the developing tropical disturbance/cyclone.|$|R
