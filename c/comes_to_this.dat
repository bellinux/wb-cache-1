It first stated that “Any system of prior restraints of expression <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> Court bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity”. The purpose of this statement was to make the presence of the inherent conflict between the Government’s efforts and the First Amendment clear. The decision then stated that the government “thus carries a heavy burden of showing justification for the imposition of such a restraint”. This reinforced the idea that it was the Nixon Administration's responsibility to show sufficient evidence that the newspapers’ actions would cause a “grave and irreparable” danger.|$|E

Altman described Dotty as [...] "a chip off the old block", as did Nancy Banks-Smith from The Guardian though the Daily Record described Dotty as [...] "a chip off her grandma's block". Charlie Clements, who played Bradley Branning, said that Dotty, being Nick's daughter, was [...] "bound {{to be a bit}} iffy." [...] He also called her [...] "evil", as did several critics.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the next}} month, {{controversy}} against the band grew. Vice President Dan Quayle branded [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as being [...] "obscene," [...] and President George H.W. Bush publicly denounced any record company that would release such a product. Body Count {{was removed from}} the shelves of a retail store in Greensboro, North Carolina after local police had told the management that they would no longer respond to any emergency calls at the store if they continued to sell the album. In July 1992, the New Zealand Police Commissioner unsuccessfully attempted to prevent an Ice-T concert in Auckland, arguing that [...] "Anyone who <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> country preaching in obscene terms the killing of police, should not be welcome here," [...] before taking Body Count and Warner Bros. Records to the Indecent Publications Tribunal, {{in an effort to get}} it banned under New Zealand's Indecent Publications Act. This was the first time in 20 years that a sound recording had come before the censorship body, and the first ever case involving popular music. After reviewing the various submissions, and listening carefully to the album, the Tribunal found the song [...] "Cop Killer" [...] to be [...] "not exhortatory," [...] saw the album as displaying [...] "an honest purpose," [...] and found Body Count not indecent.|$|E
500|$|The season {{received}} average {{reviews from}} critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN wrote mixed {{comments about the}} season, saying, [...] "The ratio of bad to good episodes was not too favorable in this season of Family Guy. Far too many episodes were either seriously lacking in humor or were just plain poorly written", but added, [...] "While much of the original appeal seems to have washed-off, {{there are still a}} few moments from this season that really stand out", listing [...] "Chick Cancer", [...] "Road to Rupert", [...] "Saving Private Brian", and [...] "No Meals on Wheels" [...] as the best episodes of the season. Haque also gave praise to [...] "Blind Ambition", [...] "No Chris Left Behind", [...] "Bill and Peter's Bogus Journey", and [...] "Meet the Quagmires". Manisha Kanetkar of Smart House, however, felt that the series saw [...] "no sign of tiring" [...] and had [...] "as many funny moments as ever." [...] Nancy Basile of About.com regarded [...] "Airport '07", [...] "Prick Up Your Ears", and [...] "Barely Legal" [...] as [...] "gem episodes." [...] In his review for the Family Guy volume five DVD, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk said [...] "There are several points to criticize when it <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> set, including a series that's losing some of its steam and relying on comedic crutches and an oddly constructed episode structure, but in the end, the series is fun to watch, which is all you really ask for from a cartoon sitcom." [...] In a later review, Rizzo added [...] "Is Family Guy coasting on it's [...] past successes? It could be argued, as the series doesn't surprise or shock the way it once did, instead doing the things that have worked before and doing them more and larger. The DVD releases are predictable and consistent, with high quality and impressive rafts of bonus material, but if the show doesn't do it for you, that doesn't make much of a difference." ...|$|E

2500|$|Education theorist Bill Ayers has {{commented on}} the {{limitations}} of the standardized test, writing that [...] "Standardized tests can't measure initiative, creativity, imagination, conceptual thinking, curiosity, effort, irony, judgment, commitment, nuance, good will, ethical reflection, or a host of other valuable dispositions and attributes. What they can measure and count are isolated skills, specific facts and function, content knowledge, the least interesting and least significant aspects of learning." [...] In his book, The Shame of the Nation, Jonathan Kozol argues that students submitted to standardized testing are victims of [...] "cognitive decapitation." [...] Kozol <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> realization after speaking to many children in inner city schools who have no spatial recollection of time, time periods, and historical events. This is especially the case in schools where due to shortages in funding and strict accountability policies, schools have done away with subjects like the arts, history and geography; in order to focus on the contest of the mandated tests.|$|E
2500|$|The Catholic Church {{has been}} opposed to {{contraception}} {{since at least}} the second century. Many early Church Fathers made statements condemning the use of contraception including John Chrysostom, Jerome, Clement of Alexandria, Hippolytus of Rome, Augustine of Hippo and various others. Among the condemnations is one by Jerome which refers to an apparent oral form of contraception: [...] "Some {{go so far as to}} take potions, that they may insure barrenness, and thus murder human beings almost before their conception." [...] Augustine, in On Marriage and Concupiscence, states that whoever merely involving lust in intercourse without intending procreation, [...] "although they be called husband and wife, are not; nor do they retain any reality of marriage, but use the respectable name [...] to cover a shame. ... Sometimes this lustful cruelty, or cruel lust, <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>this,</b> that they even use sterilizing drugs." [...] The phrase [...] "sterilizing drugs" [...] (sterilitatis venena) was widely used in theological and ecclesiastical literatures to condemn any contraceptive acts and birth control. Augustine utilized the biblical story of Onan as a supporting text to denounce contraception.|$|E

It's the same power that helped {{a little boy with}} two fish and five loaves feed a crowd of 5,000 people." [...] When the close proximity of the first contests to the holidays led to many candidates putting out Christmas ads and videos — allowing them to keep presenting their message but in a more appropriate setting — Huckabee chose one acknowledging that viewers were tired of political messages in the holiday season and that what [...] "really matters is the celebration of the birth of Christ," [...] avoiding other candidates' [...] "Happy holidays" [...] formulation. The ad generated considerable media discussion about whether a white bookshelf in the background was a subliminal Christian cross; [...] Huckabee mocked the suggestion and said it was just a bookshelf. [...] When asked about the ad and the thought of it being a cross, Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul stated that he had not seen the ad, but replied with the assumption that it was a cross, quoting Sinclair Lewis' warning that [...] "when fascism <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> country, it will be wrapped in the flag, carrying a cross." ...|$|E

2500|$|Due to a {{wide range}} of media {{coverage}} and large scale steroid scandals fans and experts have continued to bring the games integrity into question. Major League Baseball is a game of statistics. The entirety of a player's career is based upon the consistency and credibility of the numbers and accolades acquired during the period in which they played. [...] "Their real impact has been at the margins: There are certainly some scrubs who wouldn't be in the majors without the juice, and we have ample evidence that at the other end of the scale, drugs can take Hall of Famers and all-time greats and help them perform at historically unprecedented levels" [...] (La-Times). When it <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> topic generally there are two trains of thought. Many do not see the harm with this type of substance use because it makes the game more exciting and allows athletes to reach untested potentials. On the other side of the argument many fans and experts believe the game has lost its purity because of this drug use. More recently an issue has arose with high-caliber players who have tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs are not being voted for on a hall of fame ballot. This fact has brought many to question the game's integrity. No matter the statistics and achievements produced by the certain player prior to drug use, a positive test for steroids has shown to discredit the athletes integrity and career entirely.|$|E
