50|$|The term cistron {{was coined}} by Seymour Benzer {{in an article}} {{entitled}} The elementary units of heredity. The cistron was defined by an operational test applicable to most organisms that is {{sometimes referred to as}} a <b>cis-trans</b> <b>test,</b> but more often as a complementation test.|$|E
40|$|Experiments are {{described}} that {{provide an opportunity}} to estimate the genetic limits of the structural (amino acid coding) portion of the rosy locus (3 : 52. 0) in Drosophila melanogaster, which controls the enzyme, xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH). This is accomplished by mapping experiments which localize sites responsible for electrophoretic variation in the enzyme on the known genetic map of null-XDH rosy mutants. Electrophoretic sites are distributed along {{a large portion of the}} null mutant map. A <b>cis-trans</b> <b>test</b> involving electrophoretic variants in the left- and right-hand portions of the map leads to the conclusion that the entire region between these variants is also structural. Hence most, if not all, of the null mutant map of the rosy locus contains structural information for the amino acid sequence of the XDH polypeptide. Consideration is given to the significance of the present results for the general problem of gene organization in higher eukaryotes...|$|E
40|$|Changes in gene {{expression}} {{are known to}} occur between closely related species, {{but it is not}} yet clear how many of these are due to random fixation of allelic variants or due to adaptive events. In a microarray survey between subspecies of the Mus musculus complex, we identified the mitogen-activated protein-kinase-kinase MKK 7 as a candidate for change in {{gene expression}}. Quantitative PCR experiments with multiple individuals from each subspecies confirmed a specific and significant up-regulation in the testis of M. m. domesticus. Northern blot analysis shows that this is due to a new transcript that is not found in other tissues, nor in M. m. musculus. A <b>cis-trans</b> <b>test</b> via allele specific expression analysis of the MKK 7 gene in F 1 hybrids between domesticus and musculus shows that the expression change is mainly caused by a mutation located in cis. Nucleotide diversity was found to be significantly reduced in a window of at least 20 kb around the MKK 7 locus in domesticus, indicative of a selective sweep. Because the MKK 7 gene is involved in modulating a kinase signalling cascade in a stress response pathway, it seems a plausible target for adaptive differences between subspecies, although the functional role of the new testis-specific transcripts will need to be further studied...|$|E
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{sequence of the}} C-terminal region of the recE gene of the Rac prophage of Escherichia coli K- 12 reveals {{the presence of a}} partially overlapping reading frame we call recT. Deletion mutations show that recT is required for the RecE pathway of conjugational recombination. By cloning recT with a plasmid vector compatible with pBR 322, we showed by <b>cis-trans</b> <b>tests</b> that the portion of the recE gene encoding ExoVIII DNA nuclease activity is also required for RecE pathway conjugational recombination. The recT gene can replace the redB gene of lambda for recA-independent plasmid recombination. A Tn 10 insertion mutation previously thought to be in recE is located in recT and is renamed recT 101 ::Tn 10. Discrepancies between the molecular mass estimates of wild-type ExoVIII protein determined from mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and calculated from the predicted amino acid sequence are discussed. The hypothesis that wild-type ExoVIII protein results from fusion of RecE and RecT proteins is disproved genetically, thus supporting a previous hypothesis that the discrepancies are due to abnormal protein mobility in SDS-PAGE. A computer-performed scan of the bacteriophage {{nucleotide sequence}} data base of GenBank revealed substantial similarity between most of recE and a 2. 5 -kb portion of the b 2 region of lambda. This suggests interesting speculations concerning the evolutionary relationship of lambda and Rac prophages...|$|R
40|$|The {{first three}} {{reactions}} in the catabolism of qainic acid in Neurospora crassa {{are under the}} genetic control of the qa gene cluster. This cluster consists of three structural genes encoding three inducible enzymes plus a regulatory gene (qa- 1 +) whose diffusible product apparently acts in a positive fashion to initiate coordinate synthesis of the three enzymes when an appropriate inducer is present. Genetic and biochemical evidence for both complementing and temperature-sensitive qa- 1 alleles indicates that {{the product of the}} qa- 1 + gene is an oligomeric (multimeric) protein. On the basis of <b>cis-trans</b> <b>tests</b> of appropriate double mutants (plus genetic mapping data for temperature-sensitive mutants), at least certain constitutive mutants (which produce all three qa enzymes {{in the absence of an}} inducer) are mutants in the regulatory gene and not in controlling elements such as initiators. The detection of stable (non-revertible) qa- 1 intralocus deletion (multisite) mutants provides additional evidence for positive regulation in the qa system. Extensive genetic recombination data provide evidence that the two types of qa- 1 mutants [...] slow-complementing (qa- 1 -s) and fast-complementing (qa- 1 -f) [...] map in discrete, non-overlapping segments of the qa- 1 locus. These two distinct types of mutants are hypothesized to produce altered regulatory protein molecules that fail to interact either with a DNA initiator site (qa- 1 -s types) or with an inducer (qa- 1 -f types). The striking similarities between the qa system in this lower eukaryote and certain prokaryote operon systems are discussed...|$|R

This usage {{can be seen in}} the cis-trans distinction in chemistry, the <b>cis-trans</b> or complementation <b>test</b> in genetics, in Ciscaucasia (from the Russian perspective), in the ancient Roman term Cisalpine Gaul (i.e., [...] "Gaul on this side of the Alps"), and more recently, Cisjordan, as distinguished from Transjordan. In the case of gender, cis- describes the alignment of gender identity with assigned sex.|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} reported {{the analysis of}} genome-wide expression profiles and various diabetes-related traits in a segregating cross between inbred mouse strains C 57 BL/ 6 J (B 6) and DBA/ 2 J (DBA). By considering transcript levels as quantitative traits, we identified several thousand expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) with LOD score > 4. 3. We now experimentally {{address the problem of}} multiple comparisons by estimating the fraction of false-positive eQTL that are under cis-acting regulation. For this, we have utilized a classic <b>cis–trans</b> <b>test</b> with (B 6 × DBA) F 1 mice to determine the relative levels of transcripts from the B 6 and DBA alleles. The results suggest that at least 64 % of cis-acting eQTL with LOD > 4. 3 are true positives, while the remaining 36 % could not be confirmed as truly cis-acting. Moreover, we find that > 96 % of apparent cis-acting eQTL occur in regions that do not share SNP haplotypes. Cis-acting eQTL serve as an important new resource for the identification of positional candidates in QTL studies in mice. Also, we use the analysis of the correlation structures between genotypes, gene expression traits, and phenotypic traits to further characterize genes expressed in liver that are under cis-acting control, and highlight {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} integrating genetics and gene expression data in segregating populations...|$|E
40|$|In Escherichia coli K- 12, {{the major}} glucose {{transporter}} {{with a central}} role in carbon catabolite repression and in inducer exclusion is the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent glucose:phosphotransferase system (PTS). Its membrane-bound subunit, IICB Glc, is encoded by the gene ptsG; its soluble domain, IIA Glc, is encoded by crr, which {{is a member of the}} pts operon. The system is inducible by D-glucose and, to a lesser degree, by L-sorbose. The regulation of ptsG transcription was analyzed by testing the induction of IICB Glc transporter activity and of a single-copy �(ptsGop-lacZ) fusion. Among mutations found to affect directly ptsG expression were those altering the activity of adenylate cyclase (cyaA), the repressor DgsA (dgsA; also called Mlc), the general PTS proteins enzyme I (ptsI) and histidine carrier protein HPr (ptsH), and the IIA Glc and IIB Glc domains, as well as several authentic and newly isolated UmgC mutations. The latter, originally thought to map in the repressor gene umgC outside the ptsG locus, were found to represent ptsG alleles. These affected invariably the substrate specificity of the IICB Glc domain, thus allowing efficient transport and phosphorylation of substrates normally transported very poorly or not at all by this PTS. Simultaneously, all of these substrates became inducers for ptsG. From the analysis of the mutants, from <b>cis-trans</b> dominance <b>tests,</b> and from the identification of the amino acid residues mutated in the UmgC mutants, a new regulatory mechanism involved in ptsG induction is postulated. According to this model, the phosphorylation state of IIB Glc modulates IIC Glc which, directly o...|$|R
40|$|Heterosis or {{hybrid vigor}} is a {{phenomenon}} in which the F 1 progeny is superior in characteristics than its inbred parents. Inbreeding depression refers to the reduced vigor in the offspring from matings involving related parents. The world 2 ̆ 7 s most important grain crop, Zea mays exhibits significant heterosis and inbreeding depression, and despite {{billions of dollars of}} sales and investments in hybrid maize, the underlying molecular and genetic mechanisms responsible for inbreeding depression and heterosis still remain unknown. We used next generation sequencing technologies and a sample of the most elite publicly available germplasm to explore the role of gene expression in hybrids vs. inbreds. A comparison of transcript counts from inbred parents and their hybrids revealed additive gene action to be the most prevalent among differentially expressed genes. Gene expression that deviated from additivity showed high parent dominance, suggesting that the alleles from the high parent affected the expression in the hybrid more than the alleles from the low parent. Most differentially expressed genes were inconsistent among families, however at a higher level of organization these sets of genes belonged to the same metabolic pathways and were up-regulated in different parents and hybrids, indicating that organisms often utilize compensatory/complementary genetic networks to perform the same task. Allele-specific expression analysis for all inbred-hybrid combinations showed that a majority of alleles that were preferentially expressed in the hybrids also were expressed differentially between its inbred parents. <b>Cis-trans</b> statistical <b>tests</b> revealed that although most alleles exhibit conserved expression, cis-regulation was found to affect alleles more than trans-regulation. Cis regulation was found to be strongly correlated with additive gene action identified from the transcript expression study. In order to explain lowered protein metabolism seen in hybrids, we developed novel software pipelines to investigate alternative splicing patterns in inbreds and hybrids. Results showed that the hybrid preferentially produces parental splice forms, but for a small fraction of genes, the hybrids produce splice forms that are not observed in the parental set. We also found 88...|$|R
