However, this may also be disadvantageous to the Javan rhino population, because any catastrophic diseases or tsunamis could wipe them all out at once. Poaching for their horns is no longer as serious a threat as in the past, due to stricter international regulations on rhino horn, active protection efforts by local authorities, the rhinos' elusiveness and Ujung Kulon's remoteness. However, there are still obstacles to the species recovery. In 2012, the Asian Rhino Project was working out the best eradication programme for the arenga palm, which was blanketing the park and <b>crowding</b> <b>out</b> the rhinos' food sources. The banteng cattle also compete with the rhinos for food, so the authorities were considering plans to fence off {{the western part of}} the park to keep the livestock out.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} fiscal policy can {{be limited by}} <b>crowding</b> <b>out.</b> When there is no output gap, the economy is {{producing}} at full capacity {{and there are no}} excess productive resources. If the government increases spending in this situation, the government use resources that otherwise would have been used by the private sector, so there is no increase in overall output. Some economists think that <b>crowding</b> <b>out</b> is always an issue while others do not think it is a major issue when output is depressed.|$|E

40|$|The <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> {{effects of}} {{government}} deficits are tested by adding deficit variables to consumption and investment models which extensively control for other factors. Separate variables are added for deficits resulting from {{tax cuts and}} spending increases. Effects are calculated for recession and non-recession periods, and compared to models with average <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> effects for the whole business cycle, and models without <b>crowd</b> <b>out.</b> Test results indicate 1) deficits <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> private consumption and investment, are statistically significant, and explain substantial variance. They predict “IS” curve coefficients better than no <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> models. In both recessions and non-recessions, government spending deficits were associated with complete <b>crowd</b> <b>out,</b> leaving no observable net stimulus effect. Tax cut deficits resulted in more than complete <b>crowd</b> <b>out,</b> resulting in net negative economic effects. Both {{findings are consistent with}} <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> theory. <b>Crowd</b> <b>out</b> was found to have roughly equal effects in recessions and non-recession periods. Results are corroborated by independent testing of borrowing data; total declines in private spending were about equal to total declines in borrowing associated with deficits. Financing deficits by monetary expansion may avoid some <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> problems, but only if the expansion is in the savings components of M 2, and occurs in years immediately before the deficit is incurred, limiting its practicality.

25|$|Another {{influential}} {{factor is}} oil revenues. Historically, in periods of {{high oil prices}} and the consequent petrodollar windfall, imports accelerate rapidly in virtually all consumption categories including agricultural products. This, in turn, results in <b>crowding</b> <b>out</b> domestic production and damage to the agriculture sector. After the oil price spikes following 1973, agricultural imports also increased dramatically and caused significant damage to domestic production. Between 1970 and 1976, agricultural imports grew at the staggering annual rate of 35%. This experience was repeated {{in the past couple}} of years when oil prices were at or over $100 per barrel; the result is that agricultural imports have increased at a rapid pace and foreign products now form a sizeable chunk of the household consumption basket. Over the past few years, there have been significant price increases in agricultural products in Iran. This is due both to rising domestic demand and to rising global commodity prices.|$|E
40|$|The {{dramatic}} government {{takeover of}} Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in September, 2008 was motivated {{in part by}} a desire to ensure a continued flow of credit to the mortgage market. This study examines a closely related issue: the extent to which GSE activity <b>crowds</b> <b>out</b> mortgage purchases by private secondary market intermediaries. Evidence of substantial <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> suggests that government support for the GSEs may be less warranted, whereas the absence of <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> implies that GSE loan purchases enhance liquidity. Using 1994 - 2008 HMDA data for conventional, conforming sized loans, three distinct periods with regard to GSE <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> are apparent. From 1994 to 2003, the share of loans sold to the secondary market increased from 60 to over 90 %, private sector and GSE market shares of loan purchases were roughly similar for most market segments, and IV estimates indicate relatively little GSE <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> of private secondary market purchases. From 2004 to 2006, private loan purchases boomed and dominated those of the GSEs, while IV estimates indicate <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> jumped to 50 % {{at the peak of the}} boom. This is especially true in the market for home purchase as opposed to refinance loans. With the crash in housing and mortgage markets in 2007, private sector intermediaries pulled back, the GSEs regained market share, and evidence of GSE <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> disappeared in both the home purchase loan and refinance markets. These patterns suggest that the degree of GSE <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> varies with market conditions and that the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac likely served to enhance liquidity to the mortgage market during the 2007 - 2009 financial crisis.

The magnitude of <b>crowd</b> <b>out</b> is sensitive to model specification, with more restrictive versions of the model (e. g., no employment decision, no bequest motive, no uncertainty) generally resulting in larger simulated <b>crowd</b> <b>out.</b> A welfare analysis implies that DB pensions and Social Security are not valued by households.

They randomly lynched 19 Chinese men and boys, only one of whom may have been involved in the original killing. Homes and businesses were looted. Only ten rioters were tried.
