During the negative phase of the business cycle, credit contracts more in countries with poor creditor protection. For similar shocks to business conditions, credit is more volatile in countries where creditors are de facto weakly protected. We test this idea using a dataset on legal determinants of finance in a panel of data of aggregate credit growth for a sample of 139 countries during the period 1990 - 2003.

However, funding a start-up company may pose a significant problem as they hold only limited historical economic data and often conduct business on strict capital budgets.

The purpose of this report is to describe, elaborate <b>and</b> analyse the <b>credit</b> assessment process of Swedbank and SEB and the impending challenges that may surface when dealing with different industries. The report is limited to start-up business entities in the Gothenburg Area. The report has been executed using a qualitative method and an abductive approach. The empirical data has been collected through semi-structured interviews with four respondents from the banks. The report showed that factors essential to the assessment are; the company management, the relationship between the <b>creditor</b> <b>and</b> the <b>credit</b> applicant, corporate <b>and</b> personal financial data, the business plan, past experience and securities available. When dealing with different industries, advisors are expected to have general knowledge in different industries, but there are no industry-specific advisors.

40|$|Creditor-friendly {{laws are}} {{generally}} {{associated with more}} credit {{to the private sector}} and deeper financial markets. But laws mean little if they are not upheld in the courts. The authors hypothesize that the effectiveness of creditor rights is strongly linked to the efficiency of contract enforcement. This hypothesis is tested using firm level data on 27 European countries in 2002 and 2005. The analysis finds that firms have more access to bank credit in countries with better creditor rights, but the association between <b>creditor</b> rights <b>and</b> bank <b>credit</b> is much weaker in countries with inefficient courts. Exploiting the panel dimension of the data and the fact that creditor rights change over time, the authors show that the effect of a change in creditor rights on change in bank credit increases with court enforcement. In particular, a unit increase in the creditor rights index will increase the share of bank loans in firm investment by 27 percent in a country at the 10 th percentile of the enforcement time distribution (Lithuania). However, the increase will be only 7 percent in a country at the 80 th percentile of this distribution (Kyrgyzstan).

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between <b>creditor</b> protection <b>and</b> <b>credit</b> cycle, testing the idea that weak creditor protection increases the volatility of credit.

We test the basic implications of the model using an updated data set on legal determinants of finance in a panel of data of aggregate credit growth for a sample of 139 countries during the period 1990 - 2003. We find support for the claim that better legal protections significantly reduce impact of exogenous shocks on credit.

[...] Furthermore, The Mortgage Credit Directive was designed as a preventive measure to avoid irresponsible lending and borrowing behavior by market participants in the EU and to avoid a situation similar to what happened in the United States in 2006-2008, where a real estate bubble affected over half of the United States and left many American citizens either homeless or in huge debts.|$|R

40|$|Those that {{backed the}} 2005 {{bankruptcy}} reform law {{argued that it}} would protect creditors from consumer abuse and lack of financial responsibility. The substantial {{increase in the number}} of bankruptcies over the last decade combined with the perception of systemwide abuse apparently convinced legislators from both political parties that the backers had a point. Thus, Congress enacted amendments to the Bankruptcy Code that [...] if effective [...] would fundamentally change the core policies underlying the consumer bankruptcy system in this country. The rhetoric surrounding the reform debates pressed the idea that if borrowers had to repay more of their debts, creditors would achieve savings that [...] through pressures of competition [...] would be passed on to consumers in the form of lower interest rates and improved access to credit. This essay addresses some of the problems with this justification and considers what else <b>creditors</b> (<b>and</b> particularly <b>credit</b> card issuers) could have expected to achieve with the new law. Professor Mann argues that the new law will benefit issuers substantially, though not for reasons commonly discussed in the negotiation and drafting of the statute. Means testing alone will not return enough in increased bankruptcy payouts to justify the lobbying expenditures and campaign contributions that led to the statute's enactment. Rather, the most important effect will be to facilitate the credit card lending business model, by slowing the time of inevitable filings by the deeply distressed and allowing issuers to earn greater revenues from those individuals. In a nutshell, the new law does little for creditors once they reach the courthouse. Its foremost effect will be to enable issuers to profit from debt servicing revenues paid by distressed borrowers who are not yet in bankruptcy. For issuers that depend on debt revenues, the benefits of the law could be dramatic...|$|R
