This shows the dependency of city dwellers on water resources from other river basins. In addition, the WFcons for a healthy diet (based on Mediterranean Food-Based Dietary Guidelines) and a vegetarian diet are analysed. The current Milanese diet consists of too much sugar, crop oils, meat, animal fats, milk and milk products and not enough cereals, rice, potatoes, vegetables and fruit. The latter two diets result in substantial WFcons reductions: − 29 % (to 4, 339 l/cap/d) for a healthy diet and − 41 % (to 3, 631 l/cap/d) for a vegetarian diet.

40|$|One {{challenge}} for the environmental assessment of agricultural systems is to progress from estimating whether one farming system has fewer impacts than another to estimating {{whether or not it}} can be considered environmentally sustainable. To this end, we developed reference values (RVs) of farm emissions or energy use per hectare that defined hypothetical sustainability thresholds in each of three impact categories: climate change, water-quality degradation and non-renewable energy use. We applied one RV per category to the potential impacts (estimated by life-cycle assessment) of 45 French dairy farms to identify farms below RVs in each impact category and then evaluated their management and production characteristics. Seventeen of the 45 farms lie below {{at least one of the}} three RVs. Groups of farms below RVs had a higher percentage of organic farms, larger mean usable agricultural area, longer mean pasture residence time and lower mean inputs of concentrate feed and nitrogen than those above the same RVs. In consequence, the groups below RVs also tended to have lower mean milk production per cow and per hectare. All milk production systems can move toward environmental sustainability even though, according to production mode and intensity, some potential impacts are easier to reduce than others. Most farms were unable to attain the lowest RVs, suggesting that policy-makers may need to consider less ambitious RVs for existing agricultural systems. Otherwise, the distance between normative RVs and indicator values of dairy farms suggest that production and <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> will need to change if sustainability goals do not...|$|E

These people sometimes lack agricultural experiences to yieldsufficient production for livelihoods and it {{lead them to}} abandon the land and repeating forest clearance. Sufficient and sustainable agricultural production for subsistence and crop sale is important, especially during the early stage of immigration, in order to settlers to remain the land they had occupied. To elucidate the difference in crop selection tendencies between households with production sales and those without sales, we categorised the households within a single study area in Brazil into three types: (1) households with sales income from agricultural products (SA), and households without sales income in which the variety among cultivated crops was (2) low (NL) or (3) high (NH). The crops were divided into six types: (1) tubers and herbaceous crops that can be harvested within or around a year; tree crops that can be harvested within 3 years either (2) seasonally or (3) year-round; tree crops that can be harvested only after 4 years either (4) seasonally or (5) year-round; and (6) tree crops for timber, colouring, and oil use. Our survey {{results indicate that the}} SA households had a well-designed combination of crop species, including both commercial and subsistence crops, whereas the NH and NL households were lacking in short- and long-term sales.

These differences {{are the result of}} different consumption behaviours as well as different agricultural production methods and conditions. From the perspective of a healthy diet based on regional dietary guidelines, the intake of several product groups (sugar, crop oils, animal fats and meat) should be decreased and increased for others (vegetables, fruit).

The WFP of an agricultural product {{is defined as}} the sum of the blue, green, and grey WFP (Mekonnen and Hoekstra 2011). The blue WFP refers to water consumption from surface and groundwater sources, and green WFP refers to consumption of green water resources (e.g., rainwater in so far as it does not become run-off). The grey WFP refers to pollution and {{is defined as the}} volume of freshwater required to assimilate the load of pollutants given natural background concentrations and existing ambient water quality standards. Worldwide, green water contributes about 80 % of the consumptive water use (CWU) in agricultural production (Molden et al. 2010; Rockström et al. 2014). In livestock production, green water accounts for 90 % of total CWU (Mekonnen and Hoekstra 2012), while only 2 – 8 % of CWU is blue water used for drinking water, servicing, and feed mixing purposes (Steinfeld et al. 2006; Mekonnen and Hoekstra 2012; de Boer et al. 2013; Ran et al. 2016). In Saudi Arabia, there is no natural surface water flow system and the countrywide average annual rainfall is very low (<  70  mm/year) (Chowdhury and Al-Zahrani 2013; Al-Zahrani et al. 2015). The soil moisture content is low and evaporation rate is extremely high (Missimer et al. 2014). As a result, the contribution of green water to agricultural crop production is minimal (MOWE 2013; Chowdhury et al. 2016). The only dependable source of water for crop production is groundwater pumped from the non-renewable aquifers, which represented the blue water (MOWE 2013; USDA 2016). The agricultural farms typically pump the groundwater for irrigation (Chowdhury et al. 2016).|$|E

Although the European Union has expanded its membership in the past, this enlargement is unique {{in terms of its}} scope and diversity of the countries, area, and population involved. Thus, the effects of the EU enlargement on current and future member countries and on world commodity markets require careful consideration as the European Union is a major player in these markets. We analyze the effects <b>of</b> the Common <b>Agricultural</b> Policy (CAP) reform and enlargement on the EU- 15, the NMS, and world agricultural markets. We compare three 10 -year comprehensive agricultural outlook scenarios. In a "pre-enlargement" scenario, all pre-enlargement policies of the EU- 15 are held in place and the 10 NMS maintain their independent economic policies and older technologies as if nothing happens. The second scenario considers the CAP reform in the EU- 15. The third scenario is the 2004 Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) baseline projection, which incorporates both the CAP reforms and accession of the 10 NMS with the associated domestic and trade policy reforms and some convergence in technology within the EU- 25. With prices in most commodities in the acceding countries historically below EU- 15 prices, accession leads to a moderate decrease in the EU- 15 prices, whereas for the 10 NMS, domestic prices of many commodities increase substantially. Holding income levels constant, <b>consumption</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> in these countries decrease in most instances because of higher food prices, while production levels rise.

Static analysis indicates that potential gains to the agricultural sector of the Philippines are limited, primarily owing to the low size of initial agricultural trade with EU (compared to other trading partners), as well as moderate to low tariff and other trade barriers to EU products entering the country. CGE analysis confirms that the overall impact of bilateral tariff elimination leads to an overall increase in agricultural output, accompanied by a decline in price; hence, there is an increase in <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products.</b> Impact on poverty is likewise positive, with improvements biased to the poorer households. By subsector, the largest output gains are projected for seaweeds and sugarcane, with 0. 80 percent and 0. 50 percent, respectively; increased access on EU markets are favorable for Filipino exporters of seaweeds, other fiber crops, tobacco leaf, forestry, ornamental plants, raw coffee, abaca, and cocoa. Meanwhile, the subsectors that are on the losing side (as shown by declining output) are cattle, raw rubber, chicken, and hogs. Fears about the negative repercussions of a Philippines-EU FTA on the poor turn out to be unfounded. Poverty incidence declines, and more so in rural than in urban areas. The greater decrease in poverty gap and squared poverty gap, compared with poverty incidence, implies that those who belong to households below the poverty threshold get the most benefits. It would seem that expectations of large benefits from a Philippines-EU FTA will not be found in agriculture, but elsewhere. Conversely, the agricultural sector does not face significant harm from a Philippines-EU FTA, even one involving sensitive products. Relaxation of trade barriers to EU even for sensitive products is warranted; not only would consumers gain (though minimally), but such a negotiation stance may serve as a powerful bargaining chip for gaining concessions on other areas...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{analyses}} {{have been}} performed to quantitatively link carbon stock change caused by land-use change (CSC-LUC) to <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products,</b> but results differ significantly, even for studies focussing on the same region or product. This {{is due to the}} different focuses and interpretations of the links between direct drivers and underlying causes of CSC-LUC, which can be translated into differences in key functions, i. e. specific methods, algorithms and parameters embedded in the analysis. Using the example of Indonesian palm oil production (often associated with CSC-LUC), this paper carries out a meta-analysis of 12 existing studies, determines the different settings for the key functions embedded in consumption-based CSC-LUC studies and discussed their implications for policymaking. It identifies the underlying reasons of adopting different settings within the eight key functions and their advantages and trade-offs. Examples are the way of determining how deforestation is linked to oil palm, and the inclusion of non-agriculture and non-productive drivers in the accounting to weight their roles in CSC-LUC in comparison to palm oil consumption. Following that, the quantitative results from the selected studies were processed and harmonised in terms of unit, allocation mechanism, allocation key and amortisation period. This resulting in ranges of 0. 1 - 3. 8 and - 0. 1 - 15. 7 tCO 2 /t crude palm oil for historical and projection studies, respectively. It was observed that CSC-LUC allocated to palm oil is typically lower when propagating effects and non-agricultural or non-productive drivers were accounted for. Values also greatly differ when marginal and average allocation mechanisms were employed. Conclusively, individual analyses only answer part of the question about CSC-LUC drivers and have their own strengths and weaknesses. Since the context can be very different, using quantitative results from a single study for accounting purposes in policymaking is not recommended. Instead, insights from different studies should be combined, e. g. the relative role of logging and oil palm or the contribution to CSC-LUC in regional and global perspectives...|$|E
40|$|The canned {{kidney bean}} (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is one <b>of</b> the major <b>consumption</b> forms <b>of</b> this <b>agricultural</b> <b>product.</b> In the canning industry, seed coat {{splitting}} {{is considered one}} factor affecting {{the integrity of the}} appearance in the final product. Three different dark red kidney bean cultivars (85, 453 and Nickols) grown in the Wisconsin area were studied in this research. The physiochemical properties in this study included moisture content, theIII seed coat to whole seed weight ratio, the weight per seed, ash, mineral (sodium, calcium, iron, potassium and magnesium) and total crude protein content in the seed coat. The correlations of these properties with the seed coat splits were investigated. In the canned product, highly significant differences (P< 0. 01) in percentage of split seed coat were found among the three cultivars studied. Canned cv. 85 had significantly fewer seed coat splits than the other two cultivars. Cv. 85 was significantly higher in moisture content, as well as ash, sodium, calcium and iron content in the seed coat. The seed coat of cv. 453 was significantly higher in magnesium, and total crude protein. Cv. Nickols was found to be significantly higher in the weight per bean and seed coat splits after the canning process. Significant negative correlations were found between the percentage of seed coat splits...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of the U. S. consumptionstructure in the framework of the neoclassical consumer preferencetheory [...] We have been analyzing, with a complete system of demand equations,the Japanese consumer demand based on the Family Income andExpenditure Survey and the National Income Statistics (Tsujimura (1964),Tsujimura-Sato (1964), Tsujimura (1968), Maki (1978 a), Maki (1978 b),and Maki (1979)). Under a series of research, the following observations have beenmade: (a) The household is the empirical counterpart for the behavioralunit of the theory. (b) Changes in family size in the householdinfluence the pattern of consumer expenditure. (c) The habit formationhypothesis is appropriate to describe both cross section and timeseries data consistently. (d) The linear expenditure system (LES),derived from the Klein-Rubin preference function wl. th family size andhabit potentials, fairly well explains observational data of householdconsumption expenditures, classified into five, twenty five and sixtyitems. (e) For the data classified into sixty items, demand functionsof the LES type, including family size and habit potentials, does notalways uniformly account for observational data of household consumptionexpenditures, and the tendency for the goodness of fit to be unsatisfactoryappears systematically for durable goods such as automobiles andmany kinds of electric appliances. (f) On the other hand, classifyinghousehold <b>consumption</b> into groups <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products,</b> manufacturedproducts and twenty-three service items, we get better estimatesof LES demand equations. (e) and (f) above imply that for perishablegoods and a broader classification of items our model is more suitableto the data and that our model has to be modified to explicitly includethe stock adjustment effect as the next step. These are summaries of what we learned in our past studies. Thepresent analysis, using U. S. data, will test the validity of the LEStype preference function with family size and habit potentials, whichhas proven its applicability to Japanese data. It may be best for thegenerality and validity of a model to analyze the two sets of data bydescribing the different stages of economic growth through the sameexperimental design...|$|R
40|$|Background: Human {{antibacterial}} exposure {{occur in}} different ways including <b>consumption</b> <b>of</b> animal and <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> as well as use of prescribed and non-prescribed agents. We estimated the prevalence and explored the predictors of antibacterial use among patients presenting to hospitals in northern Uganda. Methods: Four hundred fifty (450) patients were randomly selected and antibacterial use prior to hospital visit measured using a questionnaire and urine antibacterial activity assay. Urine antibacterial bioassays were performed using American type culture collections of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus pyogenes. Data were analysed using STATA 12. 0 at 95 % confidence level. Results: Of 450 patients interviewed, 62. 2 % had used antibacterial agents. Urine antibacterial activity was detected in 30. 4 % of the samples tested. Of the 85 patients who reported not taking any antibacterial at home, 16 (18. 8 %) had urine with antibacterial activity. Most test bacteria, E. coli (74. 5 %), B. subtilis (72. 6 %) and S. pyogens (86. 7 %) were sensitive to urine of patients who reported using antibacterial drugs before hospital visit. From the interview, metronidazole 15. 6 % (70 / 450), amoxicillin 12 % (54 / 450), and ciprofloxacin 10. 4 % (47 / 450) were the most used antibacterial agents. Patient age (OR, 2. 45 : 95 % CI: 1. 02 – 5. 91 : P = 0. 024), time-lag between last drug intake and hospital visit (OR: 3. 18 : 95 % CI: 1. 44 – 7. 0 : P < 0. 0001), and time-lag between illness onset and hospital visit (OR: 1. 89 : 95 % CI: 0. 38 – 5. 1 : P = 0. 027) predicted the use of antibacterial agents before hospital visit. Discussion: Community antibacterial use continues {{to take place in}} an unregulated manner. In addition, physiciansrarely seek to ascertain prior use of antibacterial agents among patients presenting to hospitals. This couldhave a bearing on patient treatment outcomes. Conclusion: Knowledge of prior antibacterial use among patients presenting to hospitals is useful to physicians in ensuring antibacterial stewardship...|$|R
