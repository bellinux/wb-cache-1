5|$|The {{performance}} of binary search {{can be analyzed}} by reducing the procedure to a binary comparison tree, where the root node is the middle element of the array. The middle element of the lower half is the left <b>child</b> <b>node</b> of the root and the middle element of the upper half is the right <b>child</b> <b>node</b> of the root. The rest of the tree is built in a similar fashion. This model represents binary search; starting from the root node, {{the left or right}} subtrees are traversed depending on whether the target value is less or more than the node under consideration, representing the successive elimination of elements.|$|E
25|$|A {{degenerate}} (or pathological) tree {{is where}} each parent node {{has only one}} associated <b>child</b> <b>node.</b> This means that performance-wise, the tree will behave like a linked list data structure.|$|E
25|$|B-trees have {{substantial}} advantages over alternative implementations {{when the time}} to access the data of a node greatly exceeds the time spent processing that data, because then the cost of accessing the node may be amortized over multiple operations within the node. This usually occurs when the node data are in secondary storage such as disk drives. By maximizing the number of keys within each internal node, {{the height of the}} tree decreases and the number of expensive node accesses is reduced. In addition, rebalancing of the tree occurs less often. The maximum number of child nodes depends on the information that must be stored for each <b>child</b> <b>node</b> and the size of a full disk block or an analogous size in secondary storage. While 2-3 B-trees are easier to explain, practical B-trees using secondary storage need a large number of child nodes to improve performance.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{efficiency}} often improves if the recursion is stopped at relatively large base cases, {{and these are}} solved non-recursively, resulting in a hybrid algorithm. This strategy avoids the overhead of recursive calls that do little or no work, and may also allow the use of specialized non-recursive algorithms that, for those base cases, are more efficient than explicit recursion. A general procedure for a simple hybrid recursive algorithm is short-circuiting the base case, also known as arm's-length recursion. In this case whether the next step {{will result in the}} base case is checked before the function call, avoiding an unnecessary function call. For example, in a tree, rather than recursing to a <b>child</b> <b>node</b> and then checking if it is null, checking null before recursing; this avoids half the function calls in some algorithms on binary trees. Since a D algorithm eventually reduces each problem or sub-problem instance to a large number of base instances, these often dominate the overall cost of the algorithm, especially when the splitting/joining overhead is low. Note that these considerations do not depend on whether recursion is implemented by the compiler or by an explicit stack.|$|E

[...] If a node is labeled with a code of the form (0,e) then it has no children. [...] This tree describes how A [...] is built from sets of smaller rank.

50|$|In {{the case}} where the <b>child</b> <b>nodes</b> of the {{collapsed}} <b>nodes</b> themselves have <b>children,</b> the conditional distribution {{of one of these}} <b>child</b> <b>nodes</b> given all other nodes in the graph will {{have to take into account}} the distribution of these second-level children. In particular, the resulting conditional distribution will be proportional to a product of the compound distribution as defined above, and the conditional distributions of all of the <b>child</b> <b>nodes</b> given their parents (but not given their own children). This follows from the fact that the full conditional distribution is proportional to the joint distribution. If the <b>child</b> <b>nodes</b> of the collapsed nodes are continuous, this distribution will generally not be of a known form, and may well be difficult to sample from despite the fact that a closed form can be written, for the same reasons as described above for non-well-known compound distributions.
