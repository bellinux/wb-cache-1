Quantifying a network's topological structure facilitates network exploration and analysis, and network comparison, clustering and classification. A number of Wiener <b>type</b> <b>indices</b> {{have recently been}} incorporated as distance-based descriptors of complex networks, such as the R package QuACN. Wiener <b>type</b> <b>indices</b> are known to depend both on the network's number of nodes and topology. To apply these indices to measure similarity of networks of different numbers of nodes, normalization of these indices is needed to correct {{the effect of the}} number of nodes in a network. This paper aims to fill this gap. Moreover, we introduce an f-Wiener index of network G, denoted by Wf(G). This notion generalizes the Wiener index to a very wide class of Wiener <b>type</b> <b>indices</b> including all known Wiener <b>type</b> <b>indices.</b> We identify the maximum and minimum of Wf(G) over a set of networks with n nodes. We then introduce our normalized-version of f-Wiener index. The normalized f-Wiener indices were demonstrated, in a number of experiments, to improve significantly the hierarchical clustering over the non-normalized counterparts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. With {{respect to}} the {{specific}} requirements of advanced OODB applications, index data structures for type hierarchies in OODBMS have to provide efficient support for multiattribute queries and have to allow index optimization for a particular query profile. We describe the multikey <b>type</b> <b>index</b> and an efficient implementation of this indexing scheme. It meets both requirements: {{in addition to its}} multiattribute query capabilities it is designed as a mediator between two standard design alternatives, key-grouping and type-grouping. A prerequisite for the multikey <b>type</b> <b>index</b> is a linearization algorithm which maps type hierarchies to linearly ordered attribute domains {{in such a way that}} each subhierarchy is represented by an interval of this domain. The algorithm extends previous results with respect to multiple inheritance. The subsequent evaluation of our proposal focuses on storage space overhead as well as on the number of disk I/O operations needed for query execution. The analytical results for the multikey <b>type</b> <b>index</b> are compared to previously published figures for well-known single-key search structures. The comparison clearly shows the superiority of the multikey <b>type</b> <b>index</b> for a large class of query profiles...|$|R

40|$|IN [6], {{the author}} {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} a sign <b>type</b> <b>indexed</b> by the set {(/, j) | 1 =£i, j * = n, i ¥=j} for the description of the cells in the affine Weyl group of type A, (in the sense of Kazhdan and Lusztig [3]). Later, the author generalized it by defining a sign <b>type</b> <b>indexed</b> by any root system [8]. Since then, sign type has played a more and more important role {{in the study of the}} cells of any irreducible affine Weyl group [1], [2], [5], [8], [9], [10], [12]. Thus it is worth studying sign type itself. One task is to enumerate various kinds of sign types. In [8], the author verified Carter's conjecture on the number of all sign <b>types</b> <b>indexed</b> by any irreducible root system. In the present paper, we consider some special kind of sign types, called ffi-sign types. We show that these sign types are in one-to-one correspondence with the increasing subsets of the related positive root system as a partially ordered set. Thus we get the number of all the ©-sign <b>types</b> <b>indexed</b> by any irreducible positive root system * + by enumerating all the increasing subsets of +. Such a number has...|$|R

The specific directions where the maximum response of the structure is expected were experimentally identified for x- and y-directions {{as well as for}} rotational direction. The power spectral density (PSD) was computed for the response of the structure based on the frequency of the first three modes and also water level changes in the device container by using fast Fourier transform (FFT). The performances of these two controllers regarding suppressing the structural vibration were compared for the seismic loads applied in an experimentally identified critical direction. The results show that these systems are effective in terms of mitigating the coupled lateral and torsional vibrations of a scaled three-story irregular model...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{develops}} the pedestrian evaluation system from two aspects which are implementation effect evaluation index system and evaluation method. Firstly, it analyzes {{the requirements of}} the evaluation index system of pedestrian reconstructing plans. On the basis, it establishes the implementation effect evaluation index system considering three aspects which are pedestrian facilities, transportation and safety. Then, it proposes the evaluation stages which are to make negative <b>type</b> <b>indexes</b> convert to positive <b>type</b> <b>indexes,</b> to make indexes being dimensionless, to calculate the weight for every index, and to calculate the comprehensive index value. In this paper, it studies the applicability of the different converted methods from negative <b>type</b> <b>indexes</b> to positive <b>type</b> <b>indexes</b> and non-dimensional methods considering the characteristic of the pedestrian evaluation indexes. And it proposes the two-level combined method for calculating weights on the basis of comparative analysis about three methods, which are the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, entropy method and information weight method. Finally, the paper applies the proposed evaluation system to calculate the comprehensive index values before and after pedestrian reconstructing plans along 3 rd Round-the-Corridor in Danling Street in Zhongguancun West Area. The comprehensive value after reconstruction is 0. 739 based on the two-level combined evaluation method, which is higher than the value before reconstruction. The result shows that it is useful of pedestrian reconstructing plans to improve the service level of the sidewalk...|$|R
