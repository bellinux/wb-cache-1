Following this, Range sits on a couch and uses the nail polish to colour her nails. The group is again seen in the <b>cubicles,</b> where they repeatedly open and close the doors. Later, Buchanan, Range and Berrabah are featured in front of red curtains with traditional silver, gold and black outfits, respectively.

5|$|Dairying is only {{economic}} in Wales with {{a sufficiently}} large herd in a productive lowland area. Hand-milking a few cows in a byre {{is a thing}} of the past and nowadays herds are milked by machine in modern parlours, two or three times a day. The milk passes by pipeline to the cooler and is stored in a refrigerated bulk tank and collected by milk tanker daily. In general, the cows graze outdoors in summer and spend their winter under cover, often in <b>cubicles,</b> the bulk of their feed being silage. Milk prices barely cover the costs of production, margins are tight, and there are fewer family-run dairy farms each year. In 2014, there were 1855 milk-producers in Wales, an annual decline of 1.23% since 2011, but the number of cows milked was nearly static at 223,000.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Cubicle</b> is a {{new model}} checker for verifying safety {{properties}} of parameterized systems. It implements a parallel symbolic backward reachability procedure using Satisfiabilty Modulo Theories. Experiments done on classic and challenging mutual exclusion algorithms and cache coherence protocols show that <b>Cubicle</b> is effective and competitive with state-of-the-art model checkers. 1 Tool Overview <b>Cubicle</b> is used to verify safety properties of array-based systems. This is a syntactically restricted class of parametrized transition systems with states represented as arrays indexed by an arbitrary number of processes [10]. Cache coherence protocols and mutual exclusion algorithms are typical examples of such systems. <b>Cubicle</b> model-checks by a symbolic backward reachability analysis on infinite sets of states represented by specific simple formulas, called cubes. <b>Cubicle</b> is an open source software based on theoretical work in [1] and [11]. It is inspired by and {{closely related to the}} model checker MCMT [12], from which, in addition to revealing the implementation details, it mainly differs in a more friendly input language and concurrent architecture. <b>Cubicle</b> is written in OCaml. Its SMT solver is a tightly integrated, lightweight and enhanced version of Alt-Ergo [7]; and its parallel implementation relies on the Functory library [9]. <b>Cubicle</b> is available a...|$|R

Once Endurance became trapped, and the crew were spending the days on the ice, McNish erected goalposts and football became a daily fixture for the men. To pass the time in the evening, McNish joined Frank Wild, Tom Crean, James McIlroy, Worsley and Shackleton playing poker in the wardroom.|$|E

40|$|Fifty-nine of the 65 {{dairy farms}} with <b>cubicle</b> sheds in the Norwegian county of Oppland in 1990 were {{included}} {{in a study of}} rearing accommodation, <b>cubicle</b> refusal and mastitis incidence. The farmers recorded the favoured resting location of the individual cows and heifers throughout the final week of pregnancy as well as during calving. The observations were matched with individual records of mastitis cases during the first 30 days after calving. Mastitis incidence in the heifers was analysed by logistic regression using rearing accommodation and <b>cubicle</b> refusal as independent variables, controlling for herd as a clustering factor. <b>Cubicle</b> refusal was found in 29 % of the heifers, but in only 3 % of older cows. The results of the analysis indicated a tendency for <b>cubicle</b> refusal to be associated with an increased mastitis incidence among the heifers (OR = 2. 2, c. i. 95 %OR = 0. 9 – 5. 4, P = 0. 08). <b>Cubicle</b> refusal accounted for 21 % (0 – 32 %) of the mastitis cases in the study population (PAF = 0. 21) ...|$|R

25|$|Creation of a small, (15–30 mL/1–2 tbsp) thumb-sized pouch {{from the}} upper stomach, {{accompanied}} by bypass of the remaining stomach (about 400 mL and variable). This restricts the volume of food which can be eaten. The stomach may simply be partitioned (like a wall between two rooms in a house or two office <b>cubicles</b> {{next to each other}} with a partition wall in between them - and typically by the use of surgical staples), or it may be totally divided into two separate/separated parts (also with staples). Total division (separate/separated parts) is usually advocated to reduce the possibility that the two parts of the stomach will heal back together ("fistulize") and negate the operation.|$|E

The recently demolished Bijou Theatre (in Bourke Street) proved a rich resource which provided the beautiful cast iron circular staircase, architrave mouldings {{and some of the}} doors and windows. Helen Lempriere's family donated materials and money to build the ornamental pond. The many doors that open onto the pond area are from the <b>cubicles</b> that were the students' bedrooms, which have now been combined into one long studio.

Afterward, the former infirmary became the main torture room and a new infirmary was set up in a walled-off section of room two. Of the prisoner housing, room one was considered the worst because there was an increased likelihood of attracting the attention of a passing SA man, an occurrence that could lead to immediate abuse. Most feared by the prisoners, however, were the torture rooms; the bunker, the freight elevator and the <b>cubicles,</b> where inmates were denied even the normal camp standards of meals, washing, toilets and the infirmary.|$|E

The northern room is utilised by the St John's Ambulance Service and has been divided by sheeted partitions into <b>cubicles.</b> Facilities include an early iron-framed, wheeled ambulance stretcher. The southern room has been converted into an English-style pub, complete with appropriately decorated entry. There are toilets located at each end of the subfloor, accessed from the front – the men's toilet at the southern end and the women's at the northern end. The men's toilet retains an early lead-light fanlight above the entrance door, but both facilities have been remodelled internally.|$|E

The floors are carpeted and the walls and ceiling are lined with fibrous cement sheeting. The windows are double-hung sashes with interior sills made with a terrazzo different from that {{on the floor in the}} ticket hall. Adjacent to these rooms to the north is the semi-enclosed waiting area. Its floor has a terrazzo tile pattern to match that in the ticket hall. Its southern wall is face brick, while the remainder are plastered. On each side wall, there are two banks of the same double-hung sashes as in the office, with interior terrazzo sills. There is also some solid timber shelving here. The seating, which lines three walls, is made with timber slats and framing on shaped concrete legs. Two timber-framed and screen-infill doors, with matching surrounds provide entry from each side of the platform. At the northernmost end of the building are the toilets, which consist of two toilet <b>cubicles</b> and wash areas accessed by timber doors on the south-western and north-eastern sides. Metal framed louvres open off all three exterior walls at two metre sill height. Approximately one and a half metres from the north- eastern face of the building stands a cast iron drinking fountain. A number of timber and concrete seats, the same as those used in the northern waiting room, sit against the building on its long facades.|$|E

500|$|Early skyscrapers {{were mainly}} {{made up of}} small office <b>cubicles,</b> {{commonly}} only [...] across, which were placed adjacent to one another along long corridors, following a pattern first invented in the Oriel Chambers building in England in 1864. This allowed the average small company to rent {{a small amount of}} space using one or two offices, but held out the option for future expansion by renting additional office <b>cubicles</b> if required at a later date. A skyscraper office relied on natural sunlight from the windows but if necessary was dimly lit from electric desk-top lamps. By the standards of the day, these offices were very modern, with radiators, air vents, and the latest fixtures and fittings, and modern communication systems, including telephone and pneumatic tubes were often installed. As a result, many businesses chose to move out of their older, low-rise offices in Chicago to take up tenancy in the new skyscrapers, which were felt to be more convenient and healthier.|$|E
