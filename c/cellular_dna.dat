5|$|HIV is {{a member}} of the genus Lentivirus, part of the family Retroviridae. Lentiviruses have many morphologies and {{biological}} properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period. Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the <b>cellular</b> <b>DNA</b> by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors. Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system. Alternatively, the virus may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew.|$|E

25|$|Chromosomes {{vary widely}} between {{different}} organisms. Some {{species such as}} certain bacteria, which lack histones, also contain plasmids or other extrachromosomal DNA. These are circular structures in the cytoplasm that contain <b>cellular</b> <b>DNA</b> and {{play a role in}} horizontal gene transfer.

25|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} replication systems {{during the life}} cycle of a retrovirus. First of all, the reverse transcriptase synthesizes viral DNA from viral RNA, and then from newly made complementary DNA strand. The second replication process occurs when host <b>cellular</b> <b>DNA</b> polymerase replicates the integrated viral DNA. Lastly, RNA polymerase II transcribes the proviral DNA into RNA, which will be packed into virions. Therefore, mutation can occur during one or all of these replication steps.|$|E

In contrast, the level of killing by low concentrations of bleomycin was higher among cells which had grown for three generations in defined synthetic complete medium supplemented with ferrous sulfate than among cells grown without iron supplementation. In S. cerevisiae, the uptake of iron is facilitated by a plasma membrane ferric reductase activity and a high-affinity (Km = 5 x 10 (- 6) M) ferrous uptake system. Lethal effects of 1. 3 x 10 (- 6) M bleomycin increased approximately 50 % with 10 (- 5) M Fe(II), nearly twofold with 10 (- 4) M Fe(II), and 2. 8 times with 10 (- 3) M Fe(II). Thus, iron preloading is a new experimental approach to increasing and studying the effects of the glycopeptides on <b>cellular</b> <b>DNAs</b> and other <b>cellular</b> targets.

25|$|Maintenance {{methylation}} {{activity is}} necessary to preserve DNA methylation after every <b>cellular</b> <b>DNA</b> replication cycle. Without the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), the replication machinery itself would produce daughter strands that are unmethylated and, over time, would lead to passive demethylation. DNMT1 is the proposed maintenance methyltransferase {{that is responsible for}} copying DNA methylation patterns to the daughter strands during DNA replication. Mouse models with both copies of DNMT1 deleted are embryonic lethal at approximately day 9, due to the requirement of DNMT1 activity for development in mammalian cells.|$|E

In this case, a gene cassette with a dual selectable marker {{can be incorporated into}} the DNA at the specific location of mutagenesis. After selection of recombinants, a subsequent transformation to transfect linear DNA with the desired mutation is performed, which will then be homologously recombined into the <b>cellular</b> <b>DNA</b> in place of the marker. Therefore, counterselection against the cells containing the marker needs to be performed in order to identify the cells that have successfully incorporated the linear DNA into the target sequence. This can be verified using PCR screening.|$|E

25|$|At {{very high}} doses, AZT's {{triphosphate}} form may also inhibit DNA polymerase used by human cells to undergo cell division, {{but regardless of}} dosage AZT has an approximately 100-fold greater affinity for HIV's reverse transcriptase. The selectivity has been proven {{to be due to}} the cell's ability to quickly repair its own DNA chain if it is broken by AZT during its formation, whereas the HIV virus lacks that ability. Thus AZT inhibits HIV replication without affecting the function of uninfected cells. At sufficiently high dosages, AZT begins to inhibit the <b>cellular</b> <b>DNA</b> polymerase used by mitochondria to replicate, accounting for its potentially toxic but reversible effects on cardiac and skeletal muscles, causing myositis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cellular</b> <b>DNA</b> {{integrity}} is often compromised in cancer. Genome instability {{can refer to}} the accumulation of extra copies of DNA/chromosomes, chromosomal translocations, chromosomal inversion, chromosome deletions, single stranded breaks in DNA, double stranded breaks in DNA, the intercalation of foreign substances into the DNA double helix, or any abnormal changes in DNA tertiary structure that can cause either the loss of DNA, or the misexpression of genes. It appears that H19 expression is tightly linked to the ploidy of the cell. Diploid liver cells express high levels of H19, whereas the polyploid cell fraction do not express H19. Also, diploid mesenchymal stem cells express high levels of H19 compared to polyploid mesenchymal stem cells. Knock-down of H19 lead to increased polyploidization of mesenchymal stem cells, and induced polyploidy resulted in reduced expression of H19, providing a direct link between H19 expression {{and the amount of}} DNA within the cell.|$|E

We report here that human KB cells infected with cyt mutants synthesized a reduced amount of viral DNA as compared with cells infected with the parental virus. Furthermore, the newly synthesized viral and <b>cellular</b> <b>DNAs</b> were extensively degraded in mutant-infected cells.
