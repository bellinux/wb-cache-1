25|$|Together with cysteine, {{methionine}} {{is one of}} two sulfur-containing proteinogenic amino acids. Excluding the {{few exceptions}} where methionine may act as a redox sensor (e.g.,), methionine residues do not have a <b>catalytic</b> <b>role.</b> This is in contrast to cysteine residues, where the thiol group has a <b>catalytic</b> <b>role</b> in many proteins. The thioether does however have a minor structural role due to the stability effect of S/π interactions between the side chain sulfur atom and aromatic amino acids in one-third of all known protein structures. This lack of a strong role is reflected in experiments where little effect is seen in proteins where methionine is replaced by norleucine, a straight hydrocarbon sidechain amino acid which lacks the thioether.|$|E

500|$|The {{discovery}} of the Dormition of the Virgin on Syros, an authentic and signed work from the painter's Cretan period, and the extensive archival research in the early 1960s, contributed to the rekindling and reassessment of these theories. Although following many conventions of the Byzantine icon, aspects of the style certainly show Venetian influence, and the composition, showing the death of Mary, combines the different doctrines of the Orthodox Dormition of the Virgin and the Catholic Assumption of the Virgin. Significant scholarly works {{of the second half}} of the 20th century devoted to El Greco reappraise many of the interpretations of his work, including his supposed Byzantinism. Based on the notes written in El Greco's own hand, on his unique style, and on the fact that El Greco signed his name in Greek characters, they see an organic continuity between Byzantine painting and his art. According to Marina Lambraki-Plaka [...] "far from the influence of Italy, in a neutral place which was intellectually similar to his birthplace, Candia, the Byzantine elements of his education emerged and played a <b>catalytic</b> <b>role</b> in the new conception of the image which is presented to us in his mature work". In making this judgement, Lambraki-Plaka disagrees with Oxford University professors Cyril Mango and Elizabeth Jeffreys, who assert that [...] "despite claims to the contrary, the only Byzantine element of his famous paintings was his signature in Greek lettering". Nikos Hadjinikolaou states that from 1570 El Greco's painting is [...] "neither Byzantine nor post-Byzantine but Western European. The works he produced in Italy belong to the history of the Italian art, and those he produced in Spain to the history of Spanish art".|$|E

Although there was an increase in the labour force, a variety of social problems also emerged with the concentration of new populations in the suburbs of the old city, such as Nikaia, Keratsini, Drapetsona and Korydallos.|$|E

30|$|During the {{dechlorination}} of p-CP by Fe-Pd@PGA NPs, the Pd loading is also {{an important}} factor for the dechlorination activity. As shown in Fig.  3 b, c, the Fe-Pd@PGA NPs with higher Pd content displayed higher dechlorination activity. This phenomenon is consistent with that reported in many previous studies. An explanation is that Fe and Pd can form galvanic cells, and Pd could accept electrons from Fe, which played <b>catalytic</b> <b>roles</b> not only accelerating Fe corrosion but also improving dechlorination activity [45]. It is worth noting that, without PGA modification, it is difficult to achieve high dechlorination efficiency even with high Pd loading. Therefore, the modification of PGA is crucial to the high dechlorination activity of Fe-Pd@PGA NPs.|$|R

Furthermore, the reactive oxygen species generated as byproducts of aerobic respiration are highly damaging to FeS clusters, and free iron and sulfide released by FeS clusters are, in turn, toxic to cells.
