40|$|Sea {{and coastal}} areas of Badung Regency, {{especially}} Kuta Political District is growing rapidly as a tourism area. Increasing community activities created pollution and affected conservation areas, include Kuta Beach. This research aimed {{to know the}} positive and negative impacts of community activities of hotels, restaurants, settlement/housing, tradings and services, industries and fisherman. Besides, identification seawater quality of Kuta Beach on their physical, chemical and microbiological parameters during rainy seasons as well as to find out effort on environment conservation done by government and local communities in Kuta Political District. Samples were determined using purposive sampling method collected from three locations at Kuta Beach, which then analysed insite and at analytical laboratory. Seawater quality on their physical, chemical and microbiological parameters ratio was compared with based on standard of seawater quality for marine recreation according to Decree of the State’s Minister Environment Act Number 51 years 2004. The index of the population was then calculated to gain the population index. Samples of community activities were collected using questioner, interview and observation and then analysed by qualitative description method. The result showed that activities at the sea and coastal areas of Kuta Political District had an impact such as increase population and job availability, provision of income to Badung Regency and Tradition Village, environment aesthetics, perception of community, culture and region perform, waste and environment sanitation, land use degradation of coastal border, mobility of motorized vehicle and seawater intrusion. The water quality of Kuta Beach during rainy seasons in February year 2006 exceeded the threshold level or quality standard such as rubbish, NH 3, NO 2, NO 3, PO 4, Cu, Cd, Pb, E. coli and coliform. DO exceeded the minimum limits of seawater quality standard. Whereas, parameters which did not yet exceed the maximum limits namely: temperature, colour, smell, turbidity, TDS, salinity, pH, BOD, <b>COD,</b> <b>fat</b> and oil, fenol, Hg and Fe. The result showed that score of calculation pollution index of Kuta Beach seawater in three research zone, were between 6, 46 and 6, 77. The effort on environment conservation in Kuta Political District had been conducted by local community and government, but long term effort in environment conservation is still needed better strategy and actions in an integrated and sustainable manners...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the experiment was to study the body factors related to the variation of dressing percentage in castrated males or non-pregnant females, slaughtered at fourteen months of age. The animals were finished with energetic supplementation on cultivated pasture. Twelve contemporary animals of each sex were used, all crossbred Nellore (3 / 8) x Hereford (5 / 8) from the same herd. Farm live weight, slaughterhouse live weight and hot carcass weight were superior in males, being 365. 8; 350. 4 and 203. 4 kg, respectively, while the females showed 310. 3; 294. 5; and 168. 6 kg, in the same order. Males also showed higher hot carcass dressing percentage in relation to farm live weight (55. 6 vs 54. 4 %) and in relation to slaughterhouse weight (58. 1 vs 57. 2 %) than females. The lower female dressing percentage {{was a result of}} the higher hide (9. 03 vs 7. 96 %), inguinal fat in the udder of heifers or <b>cod</b> <b>fat</b> of steers (1. 02 vs. 67 %), full digestive tract (19. 35 vs 16. 84 %), empty rumen plus reticulum (2. 34 vs 1. 91 %) and empty intestine (2. 54 vs 2. 11 %) percentages. There {{was no significant difference between}} sexes in heart, liver, lungs, kidneys and spleen percentages, being, respectively, 0. 40, 0. 93, 1. 01, 0. 22 and 0. 35 % in males and 0. 41, 0. 98, 1. 02, 0. 22 and 0. 30 % in females, cited in the same order. KEY WORDS: braford, hide, organs, rumen, sex. Este trabalho teve como objetivo estudar os fatores corporais envolvidos na variação do rendimento de carcaça em machos castrados ou fêmeas não prenhes, abatidos aos quatorze meses de idade. Os animais foram terminados com suplementação energética sobre pastagem cultivada. Utilizaram-se doze animais de cada sexo, mestiços Nelore (3 / 8) x Hereford (5 / 8), contemporâneos do mesmo rebanho. Os pesos de fazenda, de frigorífico e de carcaça quente foram superiores nos machos, sendo de 365, 8; 350, 4 e 203, 4 kg, respectivamente, enquanto as fêmeas apresentaram 310, 3; 294, 5; e 168, 6 kg, citados na mesma ordem. Bovinos machos também apresentaram maiores rendimentos de carcaça quente em relação ao peso de fazenda (55, 6 vs 54, 4 %) e em relação ao peso de frigorífico (58, 1 vs 57, 2 %) do que as fêmeas. O menor rendimento de carcaça das fêmeas deveu-se ao maior percentual de couro (9, 03 vs 7, 96 %), gordura inguinal, junto ao úbere das fêmeas ou à capadura dos machos (1, 02 vs 0, 67 %), trato digestivo cheio (19, 35 % vs 16, 84 %), rúmen mais retículo vazios (2, 34 vs 1, 91 %) e intestino vazio (2, 54 % vs 2, 11 %). Não houve diferença significativa entre sexos nos percentuais de coração, fígado, pulmões, rins e baço, sendo, respectivamente, 0, 40 %, 0, 93 %, 1, 01 %, 0, 22 % e 0, 35 % nos machos e 0, 41 %, 0, 98 %, 1, 02 %, 0, 22 % e 0, 30 % nas fêmeas, citados na mesma ordem.

40|$|Proyecto de Graduación (Licenciatura en Ingeniería Ambiental) Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica, Escuela de Química, 2015. The cheese {{industry}} {{in the country is}} an activity in constant growth, however there are no regulations for the related activities, facilities, waste management, water management, among others. The lack of implementation tools in clean production and poor liquid waste disposal, generate environmental problems. The whey is the main component of pollution associated with these waters, generating inhibition in the treatment of waste water by high levels of <b>COD,</b> <b>fats,</b> solids and early tendency to acidification. The present investigation provides a diagnostic in environmental issues to some non-industrial cheesemakers, and proposes management strategies by implementing clean production in their processes and an assessment of hybrid RAFA-FAFA anaerobic treatment for decontaminating their wastewaters. Environmental audits were conducted in five dairies in the area of Santa Cruz de Turrialba, where their processes, activities, facilities, and wastewater management were characterized as well as the conduction of physical and chemical analysis for the wastewater in each dairy. Using the tool EcoInspector 2. 1, areas with potential for improvement were identified. A dairy farm was chosen for feeding two pilot hybrid anaerobic reactors. The reactors treatability were evaluated without adding alkalinity, with a COD: 2 (g / L), HTR: 3. 5 d, VOC: 0. 5714 (kg COD / m 3 d *) and then with a dose of 2 g / L NaHCO 3 / L for the substrate, approximately 3 g / L COD, HTR: 2. 3 d, VOC 1. 2857 (kg COD / d * m 3). It was found that while the dairies produce the same type of cheese, there are differences between them and the areas where they present greater opportunities for improvement in the standardizing of their processes, water recycling, wastewater treatment management, curd production for cheese and the reuse of whey. The wastewater generated is difficult to treat and will have variable characteristics; {{it is not possible to}} implement hybrid reactors without adding alkalizing, because the rapid acidification; whereas with values between (3 - 6) g COD/L, the addition of 30 g NaHCO 3 /L of alkalizer for the conditioning of inoculum, 2 g NaHCO 3 /L and 1 mL/L of nutrient solution for the substrate, it is feasible to use hybrid anaerobic systems, reaching COD removal efficiencies between (65 - 90) %, but should expand the study of this type of treatment.

40|$|An {{unconventional}} {{system for}} separate collection of food waste was investigated through evaluation of three full-scale {{systems in the}} city of Malmö, Sweden. Ground food waste is led to a separate settling tank where food waste sludge is collected regularly with a tank-vehicle. These tank-connected systems {{can be seen as a}} promising method for separate collection of food waste from both households and restaurants. Ground food waste collected from these systems is rich in fat and has a high methane potential when compared to food waste collected in conventional bag systems. The content of heavy metals is low. The concentrations of N-tot and P-tot in sludge collected from sedimentation tanks were on average 46. 2 and 3. 9 g/kg TS, equalling an estimated 0. 48 and 0. 05 kgN-tot and P-tot respectively per year and household connected to the food waste disposer system. Detergents in low concentrations can result in increased degradation rates and biogas production, while higher concentrations can result in temporary inhibition of methane production. Concentrations of <b>COD</b> and <b>fat</b> in effluent from full-scale tanks reached an average of 1068 mg/l and 149 mg/l respectively over the five month long evaluation period. Hydrolysis of the ground material is initiated between sludge collection occasions (30 days). Older food waste sludge increases the degradation rate and the risks of fugitive emissions of methane from tanks between collection occasions. Increased particle size decreases hydrolysis rate and could thus decrease losses of carbon and nutrients in the sewerage system, but further studies in full-scale systems are needed to confirm this...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparative}} study between traditional patés elaborated with pork liver and fish patés (salmon, anchovy and cod) was carried out. The nutritional value and their security related to cholesterol oxidation products (COP) content were evaluated. Salmon paté showed similar fat content (24 - 28 %) and energetic value (300 Kcal/ 100 g) to pork liver patés, whereas patés made with anchovy and <b>cod</b> showed less <b>fat</b> (13 - 16 %) and calories (200 - 236 Kcal/ 100 g). PUFA/SFA ratios were much higher in all fish patés (1. 55 - 4. 95) than in liver pork patés (0. 36 - 0. 44). No great {{differences were found}} in ω- 6 /ω- 3 ratio between salmon and pork liver patés (11. 34 - 18. 4), being even much higher this ratio in anchovy (32. 32) and cod patés (62. 77). EPA and DHA supply was around 0. 63 for salmon, 0. 21 for anchovy and 0. 07 for cod patés. Cholesterol amounts were lower in fish patés (31 - 37 mg/ 100 g) than in pork liver patés (77 - 102 mg/ 100 g). Total COP ranged 0. 38 - 2. 83 ppm, without clear differences between pork liver and fish patés...|$|R
40|$|Cod liver {{is deemed}} to be a rarely eaten food that is mainly {{available}} on the market as a tinned product in its own oil. In some regions, however, it may sometimes be prepared fresh or freshly smoked. Cod liver may contain high levels of dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as these fat-soluble contaminants accumulate in particular in lean fish, like in the liver of cod. In recent years there was unclarity about {{whether there is a}} maximum level for fish liver in the European Union. In the meantime the European Commission is of the opinion that the assessment of the marketability of cod liver tins can be undertaken using the maximum level for dioxins and PCBs in seafood oils. This maximum level is 10 pictograms WHOPCDD/F-PCB-TEQ 1 per gram <b>fat.</b> <b>Cod</b> liver tins are {{deemed to be}} compound foods containing cod liver and cod liver oil. Freshly smoked cod liver, which is sold on the market, should also be examined for its content of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs as cod liver oil is also released during preparation that can be eaten with the liver, too. Consumers such as fishermen and anglers who process or eat cod liver themselves, may not be protected by this maximum level. In areas in which cod is caught and processed for personal use, BfR, therefore, recommends the issuing of regional consumption warnings about the liver of this fish by the federal Laender concerned...|$|R
40|$|The diet {{originally}} (1) {{and still}} commonly {{used for the}} production of "rat acrodynia, " the specific vitamin Be deficiency disease in this animal, consists of casein, cane sugar (or rice starch), melted butter <b>fat,</b> <b>cod</b> liver oil and salt mixture and is supplemented with vitamin BI and riboflavin. During the last few years it has become evident that this ration lacks at least two (2) and probably more factors (3), one of which is vitamin Bs. Under the conditions chosen, vitamin Be deficiency is the primary disturbance and prevails over the other deficiencies. This is an illustration of the phenomenon of "concurrence " or "competition " of vitamin deficiency diseases. In a previous paper (3) observations were reported to the effect that this rule might have its exception even under identical conditions. For example, in several instances of acrodynia which had developed in rats kept on the diet deficient in vitamin Be, spontaneous improvement of the skin lesion occurred but the rats became, at the same time, progressively anemic, exhibiting the typical picture of panmyelophthisis with all its manifestations [...] agranulocytosis and hemorrhagic diathesis in addition to the anemia. In these rats the concurrence of deficiency diseases ended in favor of a disease which usually is relegated to a latent position. In view of this conception it was logical to expect to find, as was actually the case, panmyelophthisis present in the majority of the animals after the specific Be deficiency disease had been successfully treated with purified Be preparations. Panmyelophthisis is not the only disease that might complicate experimental work on vitamin Be deficiency, owing {{to the fact that the}} ration used is deficient in several respects. During the past 2 years deaths have occurred in our stock of experimental rats kept on the diet devoid of Be. At first no explanation could be found...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of obesity {{is on the rise}} {{in many parts of the}} world and so obesity-related disorders such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. These diseases are the leading causes of chronic kidney and end-stage renal diseases. The metabolic changes in obesity are associated with an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can damage DNA, cell components and disturb cell function. This study investigates the effects of high-fat diets on the expression of genes coding for prooxidant and antioxidant enzymes in the renal cortex of male C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Furthermore, it distinguishes between a diet high in animal fat (MFD, milk fat diet) and a diet high in plant <b>fat</b> (<b>COD,</b> coconut oil diet) and investigates if the effects of the animal-fat diet are reversible by normalizing the diet. The mice were fed for 30 weeks according to the specific dietary protocol. At the end of the treatment period, mRNA expression levels of the genes of interest were measured using real-time PCR. This work shows that the intake of high-fat diet (high in animal fat or plant fat) is associated with increased mRNA expression levels of genes coding for prooxidant and inflammatory enzymes. Specifically, the NAD(P) H-oxidase subunit Nox 4 and the intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) showed markedly increased expression levels. Additionally, an upregulation of the antioxidant system, particularly of the glutathione peroxidase- 1 (Gpx 1), in all mice with a higher fat intake was detected. No significant difference between the diet high in animal fat and the diet high in plant fat on the mRNA expression levels of the investigated genes was seen. The effects of the animal fat diet are not reversible by diet normalization protocol used in this work. This study provides a possible molecular explanation for the increased oxidative stress and the increased inflammation in murine renal cortex observed after high-fat diet intake...|$|R
