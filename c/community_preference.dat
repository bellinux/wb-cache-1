40|$|Background. Organs for {{transplantation}} are a scarce {{community resource}} but <b>community</b> <b>preferences</b> {{and how they}} are incorporated into allocation policies are unclear. This systematic review aimed to ascertain <b>community</b> <b>preferences</b> for organ allocation and the principles underpinning these preferences. Methods. Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, EconLit, and gray literature databases were searched. Quantitative data were extracted, and a qualitative textual synthesis of the results and conclusions reported in each included study was performed. Results. Fifteen studies involving more than 5563 respondents were included. Seven themes describing <b>community</b> <b>preferences</b> for organ allocation were identified: (1) maximum benefit, to achieve maximum health gain in recipient survival and quality of life; (2) social valuation, to base preferences on societal gain; (3) moral deservingness, to consider the "worthiness" of recipients based on their social standing and lifestyle decisions; (4) prejudice, to make a judgement based on personal ideologic viewpoints; (5) "fair innings," to provide an organ preferentially to the younger recipient giving opportunity for a "normal" life span and to those waiting for a first organ rather than a retransplant; (6) "first come, first served," to allocate the organ to recipients wait-listed the longest; and (7) medical urgency, to allocate based on illness severity and saving life. Conclusions. <b>Community</b> <b>preferences</b> for organ allocation hinge on a complex balance of efficiency, social valuation, morality, fairness, and equity principles.

40|$|Abstract Background Transplantation is the {{treatment}} of choice for people with severe organ failure. However, demand substantially exceeds supply of suitable organs; consequently many people wait months, or years to receive an organ. Reasons for the chronic shortage of deceased organ donations are unclear; {{there appears to be}} no lack of 'in principle' public support for organ donation. Methods/Design The PAraDOx Study examines <b>community</b> <b>preferences</b> for organ donation policy in Australia. The aims are to 1) determine which factors influence decisions by individuals to offer their organs for donation and 2) determine the criteria by which the community deems the allocation of donor organs to be fair and equitable. Qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to assess <b>community</b> <b>preferences</b> for organ donation and allocation. Focus group participants from the general community, aged between 18 - 80, will be purposively sampled to ensure a variety of cultural backgrounds and views on organ donation. Each focus group will include a ranking exercise using a modified nominal group technique. Focus groups of organ recipients, their families, and individuals on a transplant waiting list will also be conducted. Using the qualitative work, a discrete choice study will be designed to quantitatively assess <b>community</b> <b>preferences.</b> Discrete choice methods are based on the premise that goods and services can be described in terms of a number of separate attributes. Respondents are presented with a series of choices where levels of attributes are varied, and a mathematical function is estimated to describe numerically the value respondents attach to different options. Two community surveys will be conducted in approximately 1000 respondents each to assess <b>community</b> <b>preferences</b> for organ donation and allocation. A mixed logit model will be used; model results will be expressed as parameter estimates (β) and the odds of choosing one option over an alternative. Trade-offs between attributes will also be calculated. Discussion By providing a better understanding of current <b>community</b> <b>preferences</b> in relation to organ donation and allocation, the PAraDOx study will highlight options for firstly, increasing the rate of organ donation and secondly, allow for more transparent and equitable policies in relation to organ allocation. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Demand for organs for {{transplant}} exceeds supply. There is {{an ongoing}} debate about the relative weighting that {{should be given to}} different allocation criteria. Little is known about the relative weight the community places on various allocation criteria. This study aims to determine <b>community</b> <b>preferences</b> for organ allocation. Methods: Community respondents recruited from a web-based panel chose which patient received a transplant in 30 scenarios presenting two hypothetical patients. Patients were described in age, sex, previous transplants, whether they or family were registered donors, had caring responsibilities, adherence, time on waiting list, estimated survival and quality of life (QOL) with and without transplant, comorbidities, and lifestyle factors, such as smoking. Analyses were conducted in NLOGIT 5. 0, using a mixed-logit model. Results: Two thousand fifty-one respondents aged 18 to 83 years completed the survey. All attributes significantly influenced recipient choice except sex and having diabetes. Younger patients were preferred over older patients. Family member donor registration, having caring responsibilities, and longer time on waiting list increased priority. Pretransplant life expectancy was valued more highly than posttransplant life expectancy; 1 year less of pretransplant life expectancy required an increase of 1. 49 years in posttransplant life expectancy to compensate. Posttransplant QOL was valued more highly than pretransplant QOL. Conclusion: Lower pretransplant life expectancy (need) was more important than higher posttransplant life expectancy (utility). Although current allocation algorithms are consistent with <b>community</b> <b>preferences</b> for prioritizing children and time on the waiting list, favoring patients with high predicted posttransplant survival as potential recipients may not be aligned with <b>community</b> <b>preferences...</b>|$|R
