5|$|Although little {{evidence}} of settlements {{has been found in}} the Rhondda that date between the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods, several cairns and cists have been discovered throughout the length of both valleys. The best example of a round-cairn was found at Crug yr Afan, near the summit of Graig Fawr, west of Cwmparc. The <b>cairn</b> consisted of an earthen mound with a surrounding ditch 28 metres in circumference and over 2 metres tall. Although most cairns discovered in the area are round, a ring <b>cairn</b> or <b>cairn</b> circle exists on Gelli Mountain. Known as the 'Rhondda Stonehenge' the <b>cairn</b> consists of 10 upright stones no more than 60cm in height encircling a central cist. All the cairns found within the Rhondda are located on high ground, many on ridgeways, and may have been used as waypoints.|$|E

While in Kansas as early as 2006, residents have suggested the <b>Cairn</b> Terrier as the state dog due to the breed's appearance as Toto in the film The Wizard of Oz.
