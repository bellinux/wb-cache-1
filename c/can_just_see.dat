O'Connor of The New York Times {{wrote that}} [...] "With only the premiere to go on, The Cosby Show {{is by far}} the classiest and most {{entertaining}} new situation comedy of the season." [...] After the pilot aired, David Bianculli wrote in the Sunday Philadelphia Inquirer that [...] "This sitcom will lose to CBS's Magnum, P.I., but it's too funny, and Cosby is too good, for NBC to dump it." [...] In a separate article in the same edition, he spoke more glowingly describing it as [...] "the best TV sitcom since Cheers, and a good bet to become an instant classic. Cosby is delightful, and his series is both funny and intelligent." [...] He also described the family as [...] "amazingly real". According to Associated Press syndicated writer Jerry Buck, in the episode, [...] "Cosby handles his son {{in a manner that is}} not only funny but intelligent." [...] Mike Boone of The Gazette described Cosby and Ayers-Allen as [...] "credible parents" [...] and Cosby's fatherly advice as a [...] "delightful confrontation". Boone also noted that [...] "understanding the special world of children" [...] has always been a part of Cosby's comedy, and that this was present in the comical scene where Cliff and Theo discuss serious matters using play money. Star-Banner said [...] "The dialogue is typically Cosby [...] easy and funny [...] and you <b>can</b> <b>just</b> <b>see</b> yourself getting to like these people very much." [...] According to Associated Press writer Fred Rothenberg, the response to the opening episode was glowing with the Los Angeles Times praising the show as [...] "the best comedy of the fall season by a long, long, lonnnnnnng shot."; The New York Times saying [...] "by far the classiest and most entertaining situation comedy."; and The Washington Post calling it [...] "the best, funniest, most humane new show of the season." [...] He also noted that marketing executives were not surprised at the reaction to the show.|$|E
