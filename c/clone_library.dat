50|$|Because T-RFLP {{relies on}} DNA {{extraction}} methods and PCR, the biases inherent to both {{will affect the}} results of the analysis. Also, the fact that only the terminal fragments are being read means that any two distinct sequences which share a terminal restriction site will result in one peak only on the electropherogram and will be indistinguishable. Indeed, when T-RFLP is applied on a complex microbial community the result is often a compression of the total diversity to normally 20-50 distinct peaks only representing each an unknown number of distinct sequences. Although this phenomenon makes the T-RFLP results easier to handle, it naturally introduces biases and oversimplification of the real diversity. Attempts to minimize (but not overcome) this problem are often done by applying several restriction enzymes and/ or labeling both primers with a different fluorescent dye. The inability to retrieve sequences from T-RFLP often leads to the need to construct and analyze one or more clone libraries in parallel to the T-RFLP analysis which adds to the effort and complicates analysis. The possible appearance of false (pseudo) T-RFs, as discussed above, is yet another drawback. To handle this researchers often only consider peaks which can be affiliated to sequences in a <b>clone</b> <b>library.</b>|$|E

Infection by “Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus” restructured the native microbial community associated with citrus roots and led to the loss of detection of most phylotypes while promoting the growth of bacteria such as Methylobacterium and Sphingobacterium. In pairwise comparisons, the <b>clone</b> <b>library</b> from uninfected roots contained significantly higher 16 S rRNA gene diversity, as reflected in the higher Chao 1 richness estimation (P ≤ 0. 01) of 237. 13 versus 42. 14 for the uninfected and infected clone libraries, respectively. Similarly, the Shannon index of the uninfected <b>clone</b> <b>library</b> (4. 46) was significantly higher than that of the infected <b>clone</b> <b>library</b> (2. 61).

To reveal the denitrification ability of this organism, we first concentrated this organism by flow cytometric sorting following fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using specific probes for this organism. The purity of the target cells was about 97 % of total cell count in the sorted sample. The PCR amplification of the nitrite reductase genes (nirK and nirS) from unsorted and sorted cells was performed. Although nirK and nirS were amplified from unsorted cells, only nirS was detected from sorted cells, indicating that “Ca. Accumulibacter phosphatis” has nirS. Furthermore, nirS fragments were cloned from unsorted (Ba <b>clone</b> <b>library)</b> and sorted (Bd <b>clone</b> <b>library)</b> cells and classified by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The most dominant clone in <b>clone</b> <b>library</b> Ba, which represented 62 % {{of the total number of}} clones, was not found in <b>clone</b> <b>library</b> Bd.

The objectives {{of this study were}} to create phyla-selective 16 S rDNA PCR primer pairs, create selective 16 S rDNA <b>clone</b> <b>libraries,</b> identify novel oral taxa, and update canine and human oral microbiome databases. Design: 16 S rRNA gene sequences for members of the lesser-known phyla were downloaded from GenBank and Greengenes databases and aligned with sequences in our RNA databases. Primers with potential phylum level selectivity were designed heuristically with the goal of producing nearly full-length 16 S rDNA amplicons. The specificity of primer pairs was examined by making <b>clone</b> <b>libraries</b> from PCR amplicons and determining phyla identity by BLASTN analysis. Results: Phylum-selective primer pairs were identified that allowed construction of <b>clone</b> <b>libraries</b> with 96 – 100 % specificity for each of the lesser-known phyla. From these <b>clone</b> <b>libraries,</b> seven human and two canine novel oral taxa were identified and added to their respective taxonomic databases.

40|$|Alkane monooxygenases (encoded by the alkB gene) are a {{group of}} {{microbial}} enzymes that catalyze the first reaction of alkane degradation. Studies to determine the diversity and prevalence of alkB genotypes in the environment have focused on culturable organisms. The goal {{of this research was}} to use culture-independent methods (DGGE, <b>clone</b> <b>library)</b> to identify and characterize alkB genes, and to determine their prevalence in Arctic contaminated soils. General alkB PCR degenerate primers (alkB-Mc) were designed using the conserved nucleotide sequences of the Histidine I Box and Histidine III Box. General alkB-Mc and alkM (Acinetobacter spp. alkane monooxygenase genes) primers were used to screen the soils for the presence of alkane monooxygenase genotypes. A predominance of the Rhodococcus spp. alkB genotypes and the absence of alkM genotypes in these soils was found. alkB PCR fragments amplified from the soils were analyzed by DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis). BlastN and blastX results of the DGGE bands sequences showed that they were similar to Rhodococcus spp. alkB genotypes (~ 80 - 90 % DNA identity and ~ 80 - 90 % amino acid homology). An alkB <b>clone</b> <b>library</b> was built using the general alkB-Mc primer set, screened by RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) and characterized by sequencing of alkB clones. BlastN and blastX results of the alkB clone sequences showed the presence of divergent alkB genotypes (≤ 70 % DNA identity and ≤ 67 % of amino acid homology to data base sequences). The alignment of the clone-derived amino acid sequences to confirm functional alkane monooxygenase sequences revealed the presence of Histidine Box II and the HYG motif in all of the deduced amino acid clone sequences. These results indicate that the alkB sequences from the <b>clone</b> <b>library</b> represent novel alkB sequences.

However, {{it is unclear how}} quantitative this approach is and to what extent results from environmental DNA studies can be used for ecological studies requiring quantitative data. Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (COI) is used for species-level taxonomic studies of testate amoebae and should allow assessing the community composition from environmental samples, thus bypassing biases due to morphological identification. We tested this using a COI <b>clone</b> <b>library</b> approach and focusing on the Nebela collaris complex. Comparisons with direct microscopy counts showed that the COI <b>clone</b> <b>library</b> diversity data matched the morphologically identified taxa, and that community com-position estimates using the two approaches were similar.

Catalysed reporter depositionfluorescence in situ hybridization combined with microautoradiography (MICROCARDFISH) was used to determine the abundance and activity of different bacterial groups.

The <b>clone</b> <b>libraries</b> of 16 S rRNA genes (16 S rDNA) and 16 S rRNA from two different depths were used to decipher the bacterial community structure. Independently of the type of <b>clone</b> <b>libraries</b> analysed (16 S rDNA- or 16 S rRNA-based), four major and four minor taxonomic groups were detected.

40|$|Management of airway infections {{caused by}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{is a serious}} {{clinical}} challenge, but {{little is known about}} the microbial ecology of airway infections in intubated patients. We analyzed bacterial diversity in endotracheal aspirates obtained from intubated patients colonized by P. aeruginosa by using 16 S rRNA <b>clone</b> <b>libraries</b> and microarrays (PhyloChip) to determine changes in bacterial community compositions during antibiotic treatment. Bacterial 16 S rRNA genes were absent from aspirates obtained from patients briefly intubated for elective surgery but were detected by PCR in samples from all patients intubated for longer periods. Sequencing of 16 S rRNA <b>clone</b> <b>libraries</b> demonstrated the presence of many orally, nasally, and gastrointestinally associated bacteria, including known pathogens, in the lungs of patients colonized with P. aeruginosa. PhyloChip analysis detected the same organisms and many additional bacterial groups present at low abundance that were not detected in <b>clone</b> <b>libraries.</b> For each patient, both culture-independent methods showed that bacterial diversity decreased following the administration of antibiotics, and communities became dominated by a pulmonary pathogen. P. aeruginosa became the dominant species in six of seven patients studied, despite treatment of five of these six with antibiotics to which it was sensitive in vitro. Our data demonstrate that the loss of bacterial diversity under antibiotic selection is highly associated with th...|$|R
40|$|Expression of nifH in 28 {{surface water}} samples {{collected}} during fall 2007 from six {{stations in the}} vicinity of the Cape Verde Islands (north-east Atlantic) was examined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) -based <b>clone</b> <b>libraries</b> and quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis of seven diazotrophic phylotypes. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) rates and nutrient concentrations were determined for these stations, which were selected based on a range in surface chlorophyll concentrations to target a gradient of primary productivity. BNF rates greater than 6 [*]nmolN[*]l− 1 [*]h− 1 were measured at two of the near-shore stations where high concentrations of Fe and PO 43 − were also measured. Six hundred and five nifH transcripts were amplified by RT-PCR, of which 76 % are described by six operational taxonomic units, including Trichodesmium and the uncultivated UCYN-A, and four non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs that clustered with uncultivated Proteobacteria. Although all five cyanobacterial phylotypes quantified in RT-qPCR assays were detected at different stations in this study, UCYN-A contributed most significantly to the pool of nifH transcripts in both coastal and oligotrophic waters. A comparison of results from RT-PCR <b>clone</b> <b>libraries</b> and RT-qPCR indicated that a γ-proteobacterial phylotype was preferentially amplified in <b>clone</b> <b>libraries,</b> which underscores the need to use caution interpreting clone-library-based nifH studies, especially when considering the importance of uncultivated proteobacterial diazotrophs...|$|R
