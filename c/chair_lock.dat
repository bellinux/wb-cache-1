5000|$|Invented in {{the early}} 19th century, the tramp chair was a cage made of bent and riveted metal {{strapping}} {{into the shape of}} a chair. An individual could be placed inside the <b>chair</b> and <b>locked</b> up securely, the chair thus acting as a jail cell, particularly in towns too small to build a jail. It was sometimes placed on a wheeled platform so it could be moved around easily.|$|R
50|$|My Long-Haired Life was {{a return}} to her {{previous}} method of blending original songs and covers. Having cut her characteristically long hair when she became a mother, the album title alludes to her life of singing back when her hair was long.

50|$|The first prerelease {{version of}} the game was the Pre-Alpha. The player starts in his own house and has {{a list of things}} to do before going into the neighbor's house. A glow can be seen from your neighbor's {{basement}} door. Before the player can enter the basement, the neighbor catches him trespassing. He then bars the door to the basement and locks it.In this build, the neighbor's house is blue and quite big. However, only the first floor is accessible. The player must find a tool to get the boards off the basement door, a key to unlock it and a code to the keypad.Though every time you get caught, you get sent to your house and the neighbor will block the entry by using a <b>chair</b> or <b>locking</b> the door.|$|R
5000|$|After {{being shot}} by Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) in the episode [...] "Dead Is Dead", Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) awakens to {{discover}} that Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) has {{brought him back to}} the Island. Desmond attacks Charles, who tells him the Island is not done with him, and that unless Desmond helps him, everyone he loves will be gone forever. He has his team prepare an electro-magnetic test, which kills a team member {{in the path of the}} toroids as they set up. Desmond is bound to a <b>chair</b> and <b>locked</b> in with the toroids as the test is run. After the test has finished, Desmond agrees to help Charles. As Charles' team lead him away, they are ambushed by Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), who takes a willing Desmond away with him.|$|R

Simulating the periscope-like manual control system seen on Klingon Birds of Prey throughout the Star Trek feature films, this system changes the interface to allow direct control of weapons throughout all of the vessel's firing arcs. Flight control can be delegated to an AI helmsman or retained by the player, and the Gunnery <b>Chair</b> may stay <b>locked</b> onto a single enemy vessel or remain free to move through any firing arc.|$|R
5|$|Gibson {{eventually}} {{discovers the}} game's location and sends a SWAT team, who are sealed {{in another room}} and killed by toxic gas. Simultaneously, he and two officers infiltrate Hoffman's command center in the junkyard, where they find Dan's corpse {{sitting in front of}} several monitors connected to the police headquarter's security cameras. He sees Hoffman brought into the morgue in a body bag and tries to warn Palmer, but an automatic turret gun rises up and kills him along with his men. Hoffman kills Dr. Heffner, Palmer, and everyone else in his path to Jill, who briefly escapes before she is caught and knocked unconscious. He straps her to a <b>chair</b> and <b>locks</b> a reverse bear trap to her head; she awakens as the timer starts and is killed when the trap activates, tearing her face apart and bleeding profusely.|$|R
6000|$|Fasten the door-windows of {{the lower}} veranda. One won't fasten at all. The summer heat warped it one way, the masses of autumn rain warped it another. Put a <b>chair</b> against it. <b>Lock</b> the last door and hide the key. Sling the {{knapsack}} on one's back, take the kitchenino in one's hand and look round. The dawn-red widening, between the purpling sea and the troubled sky. A light in the capucin convent across there. Cocks crowing and the long, howling, hiccuping, melancholy bray of an ass. [...] "All females are dead, all females--och! och! och!--hoooo! Ahaa!--there's one left." [...] So he ends on a moaning grunt of consolation. This is what the Arabs tell us an ass is howling when he brays.|$|R
50|$|Benjamin Franklin Fitch was {{the founder}} of the Taylor Chair Company, {{which is one of the}} longest running, single family owned {{companies}} in the US. He originally started a furniture workshop in Bedford, Ohio that developed a unique technique for building chairs that involved using both dried and green wood. The combination of the two types of wood resulted in a <b>chair</b> that would <b>lock</b> together as it cured without any glue or fasteners. As word of his technique spread, demand for his chairs increased and he hired apprentices to help him build his unique and sturdy chairs. One of these apprentices then courted and won the heart of his daughter and they eventually married. He then founded Taylor Chair Company with his son-in-law, William O. Taylor.|$|R
40|$|Background: The use of {{physical}} restraints still is {{common practice in}} the nursing home care. Since physical restraints {{have been shown to be}} an ineffective and sometimes even hazardous measure, interventions are needed to reduce their usage. Several attempts have been made to reduce the use {{of physical}} restraints. Most studies used educational approaches and introduced a nurse specialist as a consultant. However, the success rate of these interventions has been inconsistent. We developed a new multi-component intervention (EXBELT) comprising an educational intervention for nursing home staff in combination with a policy change (belt use is prohibited by the nursing home management), availability of a nurse specialist and nursing home manager as consultants, and availability of alternative interventions. The first aim of this study is to further develop and test the effectiveness of EXBELT on belt restraint reduction in Dutch psychogeriatric nursing homes. However, the reduction of belts should not result in an increase of other restrictive restraints (such as a <b>chair</b> with <b>locked</b> tray table) or psychoactive drug use. The overall aim is an effective and feasible intervention that can be employed on a large scale in Dutch nursing homes.

50|$|Mikey convinces Brandon {{to return}} to the {{restaurant}} to explore after the Fratellis leave, discovering that the criminals are running a counterfeiting operation. As the Fratellis return, the group finds a tunnel beneath the restaurant and hides in there, sending Chunk to notify the authorities. They explore the tunnel and find the remains of a previous explorer, who also searched for the treasure, and Mikey is sure they are on the right trail. Evading various booby traps, set up by Willy, they find themselves under an old wishing well. The kids have a chance to be pulled out of the tunnel by Andy's obnoxious boyfriend Troy, whose family owns the country club, but Mikey convinces the group to continue on their journey. Meanwhile, Chunk, who has escaped the restaurant, tries to flag down several passing cars, but is intercepted and kidnapped by Jake and Francis Fratelli. When the Fratellis threaten to shred his hands with an electric blender, a terrified Chunk reveals not only where his friends are, but also the existence of the treasure. The Fratellis tie Chunk to a <b>chair</b> and <b>lock</b> him in the basement next to Sloth, their deformed younger brother kept chained to the wall. While the Fratellis pursue both the Goonies and the treasure, Chunk befriends Sloth, and Sloth is able to break their bonds; they form a third party headed into the tunnel.|$|R

She turns the page; she starts; the colour deserts her countenance; a mist glides over her vision; she clasps her hands with convulsive energy; she sinks back in her chair. In a few moments she extends one hand, as if fearful again to touch the book that had excited so much emotion, raises herself in her seat, looks around her with a vacant and perplexed gaze, {{apparently}} succeeds in collecting herself, and then seizes, with an eager grasp, the volume, and throwing herself on her, knees before the <b>chair,</b> her long <b>locks</b> hanging on each side over a cheek crimson as the sunset, loses her whole soul in the lines which the next page reveals.|$|R
5000|$|The {{library is}} named after its {{financial}} benefactor, Runme Shaw. It contains over 100,000 books, reference materials and IB syllabus-based course books. The library was extended in 2007. The library has two storeys, with 15 computers on the main floor, 2 of which are used by students to print documents. On the lower level of the library, there are 6 study rooms, each named after famous writers like George Elliot and CharlesDickens. The rooms vary in size, each containing a whiteboard, tables and <b>chairs.</b> Rooms are <b>locked</b> and must be booked beforehand. Presentations are often held in these rooms. These rooms are useful for students who need to hold meetings for their projects. The lower level also contains reference materials such as encyclopaedias which cannot be borrowed but viewed in the library. Library facilities include a heritage walk, and a permanent exhibition {{on the history of}} ACS.|$|R
50|$|Triple H and Chris Jericho {{continued}} their feud on the April 25 episode of SmackDown!, where Jericho defeated Triple H {{in a number}} one contenders match due to interference by The Undertaker, who also cost Triple H the Undisputed WWF Championship at Backlash. The following week, Jericho challenged Hollywood Hulk Hogan for the title in a no disqualification match with a stipulation added that if The Undertaker or any Raw Superstar interferes in the title match, would be suspended. During the title match, Triple H interfered and distracted Jericho, enabling Hogan to pin Jericho to retain the title. On the May 9 episode of SmackDown!, Mr. McMahon ordered that if Triple H had laid his hands on McMahon, there would be consequences. Triple H then challenged McMahon to fight him in the ring until Hardcore Holly, Test, Lance Storm, Christian and Reverend D-Von came to the ring and beat Triple H down. Jericho then came down and nailed Triple H with the steel <b>chair</b> then <b>locked</b> him in the Walls of Jericho, ending with McMahon to announce a Hell in a Cell match at Judgment Day, {{which would be a}} WrestleMania X8 rematch between the two. Later that night, Jericho and Triple H interfered in each other's matches. First, Reverend D-Von defeated Triple H after Jericho nailed Triple H with the donation box. Then during Jericho's tag team match along with Angle against Edge and Hogan, Triple H interfered and nailed all four of them and the referee with a sledgehammer. Mr. McMahon distracted and dared Triple H to nail him with a sledgehammer, enabling Jericho to nail Triple H with the steel chair. They concluded their feud at Judgment Day, when Triple H defeated Jericho in a Hell in a Cell match.|$|R
50|$|A {{music video}} was also {{made for the}} song and was {{directed}} by Storm Thorgerson. The video opens with a woman being gagged, strapped to a <b>chair</b> and being <b>locked</b> in a closet by a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist closes the closet door, before he takes the woman's boyfriend, named Mark, in as patient. Mark tells the psychiatrist about a dream he's been having. In the dream there's a street full of beds, and a rock n' roll band plays a song in a basement, while Mark is by a lake, seeing his girlfriend being kidnapped — and his girlfriend has disappeared in real life. The evil psychiatrist suggests that he hypnotise Mark. Mark agrees and he soon falls asleep and the song starts playing, while we see everything that Mark described. Soon Mark starts waking up upon hearing {{the sound of his}} girlfriend kicking the closet door. Mark pushes the psychiatrist aside and frees his girlfriend. As the two flee, the psychiatrist tries to stop them, but Mark knocks him out, and in the last scene we see the psychiatrist falling into the same lake as in Mark's dream.|$|R

Methods and design Effects of EXBELT will be studied in a quasi-experimental longitudinal study design. Alongside the effect evaluation, a process evaluation will be carried out in order to further develop EXBELT. Data regarding age, gender, use of physical restraints, the number of falls and fall related injuries, psychoactive drug use, and the use of alternative interventions will be collected at baseline and after four and eight months of follow-up. Data regarding the process evaluation will be gathered in a period of eight months between baseline and the last measurement. Furthermore, changing attitudes will become an important addition to the educational part of EXBELT. Discussion A quasi-experimental study is presented to investigate the effects of EXBELT on the use of belts on wards in psychogeriatric nursing homes. The study will be conducted in 26 wards in 13 psychogeriatric nursing homes. We selected the wards in a manner that contamination between control- and intervention group is prevented.

6000|$|They {{found the}} doors of the house {{standing}} open, the bar in some disorder--several bottles of whisky were afterwards found to be missing--and Blake, the village policeman, rapping patiently at the open door. He entered with them. The glass in the bar had suffered severely, and one of the mirrors was starred from a blow from a pewter pot. The till had been forced and ransacked, and so had the bureau in the minute room behind the bar. An upper window was opened and the voice of the landlady became audible making enquiries. They went out and parleyed with her. She had locked herself upstairs with the little girl, she said, and refused to descend until she was assured that neither Uncle Jim nor Mr. Polly's gun were anywhere on the premises. Mr. Blake and Mr. Warspite proceeded to satisfy themselves with regard to the former condition, and Mr. Polly went to his room in search of garments more suited to the brightening dawn. He returned immediately with a request that Mr. Blake and Mr. Warspite would [...] "just come and look." [...] They found the apartment in a state of extraordinary confusion, the bedclothes in a ball in the corner, the drawers all open and ransacked, the <b>chair</b> broken, the <b>lock</b> of the door forced and broken, one door panel slightly scorched and perforated by shot, and the window wide open. None of Mr. Polly's clothes were to be seen, but some garments which had apparently once formed part of a stoker's workaday outfit, two brownish yellow halves of a shirt, and an unsound pair of boots were scattered on the floor. A faint smell of gunpowder still hung in the air, and two or three books Mr. Polly had recently acquired had been shied with some violence under the bed. Mr. Warspite looked at Mr. Blake, and then both men looked at Mr. Polly. [...] "That's his boots," [...] said Mr. Polly.|$|R
