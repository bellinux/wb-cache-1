Caparo is also noted for the comments made {{as to the}} analysis of Brennan J of the Australian High Court in Council of the Shire of Sutherland v Heyman espousing the proposition that the law should develop novel <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> 'incrementally and by analogy with established categories'.

5000|$|The {{common law}} {{position}} regarding negligence recognised strict <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence.</b> In 1932, {{the duty of}} a care applied despite no prior relationship or interaction and was not constrained by privity of contract. Here, a duty of care {{was found to be}} owed by a manufacturer to an end consumer, for negligence in the production of his goods. Mrs Donoghue's claim for damages for gastroenteritis and nervous shock were allowed, where a ginger beer manufacturer had negligently allowed a snail into a bottle, which she had consumed. Lord Atkin established liability on the basis that a neighbour principle existed between the two parties, to ensure reasonable care was taken in the production of the ginger beer, so as not to cause Mrs Donoghue any unreasonable harm: ...|$|E
5000|$|Lord Macmillan {{examined}} previous {{cases and}} held that [...] "the law takes no cognizance of carelessness in the abstract. It concerns itself with carelessness only {{where there is}} a duty to take care and where failure in that duty has caused damage". Whether there was a duty and breach would be examined by the standard of the reasonable person. These circumstances [...] "must adjust and adapt itself to the changing circumstances of life. The <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> are never closed". Lord Macmillan held that, according to this standard, Stevenson had demonstrated carelessness by leaving bottles where snails could access them; that he owed Donoghue a duty of care as commercial manufacturer of food and drink; and that Donoghue's injury was reasonably foreseeable. He therefore found that Donoghue had a cause of action and commented that he was [...] "happy to think that in ... relation to the practical problem of everyday life which this appeal presents ... the principles of and Scots law are sufficiently consonant with justice and common sense to admit of the claim which the appellant seeks to establish." ...|$|E

The definitive publisher-authenticated version Med Law Rev (2009) 17 (1) : 140 - 147 is available online at: [URL] decision in the Bailey v. Ministry of Defence case raises some interesting issues {{in relation to the}} causal concept of ‘material contribution to harm’ and its applicability in the context <b>of</b> medical <b>negligence.</b> The Court <b>of</b> Appeal considered that the ‘material contribution to harm’ test of causation is a departure from the ‘but for’ test but that it is a departure the court is entitled to make in medical negligence cases {{in the same way as}} in cases involving any other type <b>of</b> <b>negligence.</b> The Court appears to have achieved the correct result in concluding that causation in this case was established on the basis that the negligence made a material contribution to the harm, but while the outcome seems to be correct, the Court's conclusion that material contribution to harm is a departure from ‘but for’ causation is not convincing. Moreover, the case highlights the need for greater clarity and analysis in courts' approaches to causal problems. In particular, in light of the recent focus on the development of risk-based conceptions of causation, this case is a welcome reminder that less complex causal chains do in fact exist. In addition to this, Waller L. J. 's remark that ‘one cannot draw a distinction between medical negligence cases and others’ is deserving of particular attention. It will be argued that this statement is too broad and, while it is applicable to the facts of Bailey, there exists an exceptional <b>category</b> <b>of</b> medical <b>negligence</b> cases, such as Hotson and Gregg, that do require a distinct approach to causation.

50|$|The High Court {{held that}} Rylands {{involved}} ‘quite unacceptable uncertainty’ (540). It said that Blackburn J’s formulation had been ‘all but obliterated by subsequent judicial explanations and qualifications’ (536). And {{at the time}} <b>of</b> Rylands, <b>negligence</b> liability was limited to ‘a miscellany <b>of</b> disparate <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> cases’ and only with Heaven v. Pender (1883) 11 QBD 503 and Donoghue v. Stevenson 1932 AC 562, 580 was liability grounded on general foreseeability (543). The justices therefore felt that the rule should be done away with and so the independent contractor was not liable under that, but could only be culpable in the law <b>of</b> <b>negligence.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the firm}} {{establishment}} of the neighbour principle in negligence, it became clear in subsequent years {{that it did not}} represent an easily applicable approach to new forms of duty, or to unprecedented situations of negligence. As such, new <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> evolved, as in Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd, to cover different types of negligent acts, rather than a coherent doctrine or ratio being taken from Donoghue v Stevenson. Some thirty years after Donoghue was decided, in Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co Ltd, Lord Reid stated judicially that: [...] "the time has come when we can and should say that it ought to apply unless there is some justification or valid explanation for its exclusion." [...] It was not until the case of Anns v Merton London Borough Council however, that the neighbour principle was adopted in a formal test for negligence. The case involved the negligent construction of a block of maisonettes, commissioned by the Merton London Borough Council. The flats, finished in 1972, had poorly constructed foundations, resulting in sloping of floors, and cracks in the walls. The lessees of the maisonettes sued the council in negligence, alleging a duty of care existed for the building to be properly constructed and in a usable state.|$|E
5000|$|In Donoghue v Stevenson, Lord Atkin {{declared}} that [...] "the <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> are never closed"; and in Dorset Yacht v Home Office {{it was held}} {{that the government had}} no immunity from suit when they negligently failed to prevent the escape of juvenile offenders who subsequently vandalise a boatyard. In other words, all members of society have a duty to exercise reasonable care toward others and their property. In Bolton v. Stone (1951), [...] the House of Lords held that a defendant was not negligent if the damage to the plaintiff were not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of his conduct. In the case, a Miss Stone was struck on the head by a cricket ball while standing outside a cricket ground. Finding that no batsman would normally be able hit a cricket ball far enough to reach a person standing as far away as was Miss Stone, the court held her claim would fail because the danger was not sufficiently foreseeable. As stated in the opinion, 'reasonable risk' cannot be judged with the benefit of hindsight. In Roe v. Minister of Health, Lord Denning said the past should not be viewed through rose coloured spectacles, finding no negligence on the part of medical professionals accused of using contaminated medical jars, since contemporary standards would have indicated only a low possibility of medical jar contamination.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the incidence and risk of injuries to umpires in modern cricket and the potential liability in negligence of the governing bodies and competition organisers. The development of Twenty 20 cricket has revolutionised cricket both nationally and internationally providing an exciting, glamorous and financially lucrative new format. The requirement for fast scoring has led to innovative shot making and hard hitting promoted by changes to bat design. This increasingly places umpires in a vulnerable position at risk of injury from a fiercely struck straight shot and there have been examples of umpires suffering head injuries. County batsmen are required to wear designated protective helmets and the policy was reviewed after the tragic death of Australian test batsman Phil Hughes in 2014. Some umpires have personally trialed both helmets and armguards and head guards were made available by the organisers to umpires at the ICC international Twenty 20 tournament but were optional. The legal framework is the negligence liability of Sports Governing Bodies and the duty of care, through the tort of negligence, owed to officials within the context of increasing awareness of the dangers of head injury within sport. The relevant jurisprudence of cases in tort demonstrates imposition of liability for sports related injuries across a range of novel situations. There has been a judicial reluctance to develop a general principle that could impact upon the operation of sport so liability has proceeded on a case by case basis. As Lord McMillan noted in Donogue v Stevenson: ‘The grounds of action may be as various and manifold as human errancy; and the conception of legal responsibility may develop in adaptation to altering social conditions and standards. The criterion of judgment must adjust and adapt itself to the changing circumstances of life. The <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> are never closed. ’ There is no general immunity for sport and knowledge of the risk of harm coupled with an increased medical understanding of the serious consequences of concussive injury could lead to liability. It is argued that developments within the game are creating new hazards and the relevant Governing Bodies need to carefully monitor the situation and carry out relevant risk assessments and consider the need for mandatory protective equipment...|$|E
5000|$|The US Supreme Court {{found in}} favor of Mr. Stanley by arguing that {{as a matter of}} due process, unwed fathers are {{guaranteed}} the same rights as married or divorced fathers. The state assumes custody of children involving other <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> parents only after a hearing is held to determine their parental fitness, and it requires proof <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> to deem them unable to provide primary care. Thus, the same process must be applied for children born to parents outside of wedlock.|$|R
40|$|In the {{mainstream}} of law and economics the notion <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> {{is defined as the}} failure to take at least the legally specified due care level. In the standard tort model, with this notion <b>of</b> <b>negligence,</b> the efficient liability rules are characterized by the condition <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> liability, which requires that if one party is negligent and the other non-negligent then the entire accident loss must be borne by the negligent party. This paper is concerned with the question of efficiency of liability rules when the notion <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> is defined as failure to take some cost-justified precaution. The main result of the paper shows that there does not exist any liability rule which is efficient when negligence is identified by the existence of some cost-justified untaken precaution.

This approach also provides insights concerning not only the notions of care and activity level and their respective boundaries, but also the choice between strict liability and negligence. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} two claims are widely accepted: first, the ordinary {{principles of the}} law <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> imply recovery for economic loss limited only by foreseeability and, second, such recovery is unacceptable. Hence, the task of legal scholarship has been to discover appropriate policy justifications for restricting the ordinary principles of the law. This, perhaps, {{has been the most}} pressing problem facing analysis of the law <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> in recent times. This article accepts the second claim but rejects the first. That is, it argues that recovery for many kinds of economic loss is inconsistent with the ordinary principles of the law <b>of</b> <b>negligence.</b> This has been obscured, because it has largely been forgotten that the law <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> is not an area of the law sui generis. <b>Negligence</b> is part <b>of</b> tort which is in turn part of the private law. The principles <b>of</b> <b>negligence,</b> then, are meant to operate in conjunction with principles from other areas of law. When the place of tort law within the private law as a whole is remembered, the problem of economic loss evaporates...|$|R
40|$|The law <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in environmental management towards human habitat and ecology in order to tackle the problem of environmental pollution that occurs nowadays. The law <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> is used to protect an individual that is suffering from injury, damage and loses due to the pollution of environment caused by other individual. Every individual that faces this problem will make a reasonable claim in court using with the proof of important element under the law <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> that is a duty of care owed to the claimant by the defendant; a breach of this duty; damages resulting from this breach of duty; and reasonably proximate connection between the breach and the injury. Thus the uses of this law <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> are one <b>of</b> the mechanisms for solving the problem of environmental pollution that is becoming serious to the human habitat and ecology surroundings. Therefore, this paper will reveal the suitability and relevancy of the use law <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> to solve the problem of environmental pollution in Malacc...|$|R
40|$|Rediscovering the Law <b>of</b> <b>Negligence</b> {{offers a}} {{systematic}} and theoretical {{exploration of the}} law <b>of</b> <b>negligence.</b> Its aim is to re-establish the notion that thinking about the law ought to and can proceed {{on the basis of}} principle. As such, it is opposed to the prevalent modern view that the various aspects of the law are and must be based on individual policy decisions and that the task of the judge or commentator is to shape the law in terms of the relevant policies as she sees them. The book, then, is an attempt to re-establish the law <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> as a body of law rather than as a branch of politics. The book argues that the law <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> is best understood in terms of a relatively small set of principles enunciated in a small number of leading cases. It further argues that these principles are themselves best seen in terms of an aspect of morality called corrective justice which, when applied to the most important aspects of the law <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> reveals that the law - even as it now exists - possesses a far greater degree of conceptual unity than is commonly thought. Using this method the author is able to examine familiar aspects of the law <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> such as the standard of care; the duty of care; remoteness; misfeasance; economic loss; negligent misrepresentation; the liability of public bodies; wrongful conception; nervous shock; the defences <b>of</b> contributory <b>negligence,</b> voluntary assumption <b>of</b> risk, and illegality; causation; and issues concerning proof, to show that when the principles are applied and the idea of corrective justice is properly understood then the law appears both systematic and conceptually satisfactory. The upshot is a rediscovery of the law <b>of</b> <b>negligence...</b>|$|R
