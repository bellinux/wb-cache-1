500|$|Although Diodorus {{says that}} Philip {{defeated}} the new tyrants, Buckler considers {{it more likely}} that Philip's appearance on the scene allowed the Aleuadae to negotiate a peace settlement with Pherae from a position of greater strength. Philip seems to have <b>come</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the expedition with new wives from both Larissa (Philinna) and Pherae (Nicesipolis, Jason's niece), which is suggestive of a negotiated settlement; certainly, as Buckler says, [...] "Philip came away from Thessaly with a foot in both camps".|$|E

In the final, he again did not start well, but at 70 meters he pulled away to win in a World Leading time, and his 3rd fastest ever, of 9.75 seconds with a tail wind of 1.1 meters per second. He was [...]14 seconds ahead of the second place Gatlin, who ran a season best of 9.89 seconds.|$|E
500|$|The present Cathedral was {{designed}} by SirFrederick Gibberd (1908–84). Construction began in October 1962 and {{less than five years}} later, on the Feast of Pentecost 14 May 1967, the completed cathedral was consecrated. Soon after its opening, it began to exhibit architectural flaws. This led to the cathedral authorities suing Frederick Gibberd for £1.3million on five counts, the two most serious being leaks in the aluminium roof and defects in the mosaic tiles, which had begun to <b>come</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the concrete ribs. The design has been described by Stephen Bayley as [...] "a thin and brittle take on an Oscar Niemeyer original in Brasilia," [...] though Pevsner notes that the resemblance is only superficial.|$|E

500|$|Writing for The Daily Telegraph, pundit Alan Hansen {{felt the}} ease in which Manchester United {{dominated}} the final and Arsenal's inability to vary tactics highlighted why Wenger {{needed to make}} changes in the close season. Hansen agreed with Ferguson that United's lack of goal threat cost them on the day, but felt their future was rosier than Arsenal's. Nonetheless, he was of the opinion that Chelsea manager José Mourinho had little to be concerned about, concluding his piece with the sentence: [...] "A London club did <b>come</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Cardiff as big winners but it was not Arsenal, it was Chelsea." [...] In the same newspaper, Paul Hayward praised the performances of Rooney and Ronaldo – [...] "surely the best one-club pairing of under-21s in world football," [...] while ex-Arsenal player Alan Smith noted his former club's win demonstrated how Wenger [...] "for the first time, practically, in his nine-year Highbury tenure, had set up his side with the opposition in mind." [...] Capturing United's sombre mood, The Times football correspondent Matt Dickinson wrote: [...] "The black shirts {{turned out not to be}} in protest at Glazer but a reflection of their mood after the first FA Cup Final to be decided by a penalty shoot-out." ...|$|E
500|$|The review {{aggregation}} website Rotten Tomatoes sampled 29 reviews, {{and gave}} Fame {{a score of}} 83%, with an average score of 7.2 out of 10. The website's consensus reads, [...] "Just because Fame is a well-acted musical doesn't mean it flinches against its surprisingly heavy topics." [...] Initial reactions among film critics were mixed. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune awarded the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing, [...] "When the kids perform, the movie sings, but their fictionalized personal stories are melodramatic drivel." [...] Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader wrote, [...] "The film is cut at such a frenzied pitch that it's often possible to believe (mistakenly) that something significant is going on." [...] Variety magazine wrote, [...] "The great strength {{of the film is}} in the school scenes – when it wanders away from the scholastic side as it does with increasing frequency as the overlong feature moves along, it loses dramatic intensity and slows the pace." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film three-and-a-half stars out of four writing, [...] "Fame is a genuine treasure, moving and entertaining, a movie that understands being a teen-ager as well as Breaking Away did, but studies its characters in a completely different milieu." [...] William Gallagher, in his review for the BBC, wrote, [...] "Alan Parker manages to make this a fairly horrible story even while it remains entertaining. You <b>come</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> it with all your preconceptions about the glamour of showbusiness wiped away and you can't help but admire the characters who get through." ...|$|E
500|$|Australian riders won each of {{the lesser}} jersey awards. Evans won the points classification, {{represented}} in 2010 with a red jersey in {{a return to the}} original colour scheme for the three minor classifications that reflected the colours of the Italian flag. Evans's victory came about by way of nine top-ten finishes, including a stage win, {{over the course of the}} race. This classification was tightly contested throughout the race; six different riders held the jersey, and it changed hands nine times. Matthew Lloyd of [...] won the green jersey for the mountains classification, taking maximum mountains points during his stage-winning breakaway in stage 6. He made morning breakaways later on in mountain stages to take points on other climbs and consolidate his lead. Porte won the white jersey as best young rider, holding it for all but three stages. Success was widespread among the 22 teams in the race. In sharp contrast to the 2009 Giro, the only rider to win multiple stages in this year's race was Farrar, who took the sprint finishes to stages 2 and 10. , , , , , , , and [...] each won one stage. [...] had two stage wins, first with Wouter Weylandt in a depleted sprint finish to stage 3 in the Netherlands, and two stages later Jérôme Pineau led a winning breakaway across the finish line. 's Chris Anker Sørensen won stage 8 on Monte Terminillo after figuring into a morning breakaway, and their time trial specialist Gustav Larsson won the final race against the clock in Verona. [...] won multiple sprint stages, first with leadout man Matthew Goss when ace sprinter André Greipel missed out on the opportunity, and later Greipel himself took a win. [...] took back-to-back stage wins, first with Petrov in L'Aquila and then with Filippo Pozzato, who won a 10-man sprint after a late breakaway in stage 12. After there had been no Italian stage winners for the first 11 days of racing, Pozzato's stage win was the first of five in a row and six overall for Italian riders. Nibali and Basso were among those stage winners; as they also won the stage 4 team time trial, theirs was the only squad with more than two stage wins. They also won both teams classifications, the time-based Trofeo Fast Team and the points-based Trofeo Super Team. , , and [...] did not win any stages, but Vinokourov's and Arroyo's stints in the pink jersey and Tom Stamsnijder's win in the Traguardo Volante classification meant that they did not <b>come</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Giro empty-handed. Only , , , , and [...] came away from the Giro with nothing, even though Milram had one of their riders (Paul Voss) wearing the Mountains jersey at some point.|$|E

2500|$|Critics reacted {{favorably to}} Dream Theater's attempt at writing more concise songs. In their review, Loudwire commented, [...] "The band {{also seems to}} be {{expanding}} their appeal beyond the faithful with some punchy, stylish and tuneful songs that seduce immediately. Good thing, too. Because the more people that can hear an album like this, the more faithful there will be." [...] RTÉ.ie had a similar reaction, writing, [...] "Sure, the did-they-really-just-play-that? double takes arrive by the half-minute on their latest magnum opus (self-titled for extra definitiveness), but chances are you will <b>come</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Dream Theater singing a chorus rather than throwing air guitar/bass/drums/keyboards/violin/conductor's baton shapes." ...|$|E

2500|$|A strong, {{noxious odour}} {{coming from the}} rear of the plane was first {{reported}} to the cabin crew around 19:00. Flight attendant Judi Davidson, 33, traced the odour to the lavatory. She attempted to look into the lavatory but was forced back by thick grey smoke rapidly filling the small room; she then ordered the third ranking crew member to find Sergio Benetti, 37, the chief cabin crew officer, and ask him to investigate. As Benetti sprayed the interior of the affected lavatory with a CO2 extinguisher, Davidson reported the fire to the captain while 28-year-old flight attendant Laura Kayama began urging the passengers on the sparsely-populated flight to <b>come</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the front and rear of the plane and sit close together near the over-wing exits. At no time did any of the cabin crew mention to either Cameron or Ouimet that they had not yet seen flames. [...] Benetti, the one person who had managed to get a good look at the scene, had not reported seeing anything resembling the traditional causes of airline fires in pre-smoking-ban days: flames from a trash bin fire or the paper towel dispenser, both of which were commonly set ablaze by passengers smoking in the lavatories on long flights. First officer Ouimet went to investigate personally at 19:03, but was driven back by the thick smoke. At 19:04, Benetti reported that he thought the fire was probably out because he had completely doused the lavatory with fire retardant.|$|E
