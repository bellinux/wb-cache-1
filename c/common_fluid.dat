25|$|Water {{and steam}} are a <b>common</b> <b>fluid</b> used for heat exchange, {{due to its}} {{availability}} and high heat capacity, both for cooling and heating. Cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea. It's especially effective to transport heat through vaporization and condensation of water because of its large latent heat of vaporization. A disadvantage is that metals commonly found in industries such as steel and copper are oxidized faster by untreated water and steam. In almost all thermal power stations, water is used as the working fluid (used in a closed loop between boiler, steam turbine and condenser), and the coolant (used to exchange the waste heat to a water body or carry it away by evaporation in a cooling tower). In the United States, cooling power plants is the largest use of water.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his final}} {{work with the}} Tesla turbine and {{published}} just prior to his retirement, Rice conducted a bulk-parameter analysis of model laminar flow in multiple disk turbines. A very high claim for rotor efficiency (as opposed to overall device efficiency) for this design was published in 1991 titled [...] "Tesla Turbomachinery". This paper states: [...] With proper use of the analytical results, the rotor efficiency using laminar flow can be very high, even above 95%. However, in order to attain high rotor efficiency, the flowrate number must be made small which means high rotor efficiency is achieved {{at the expense of}} using a large number of disks and hence a physically larger rotor. For each value of flow rate number there is an optimum value of Reynolds number for maximum efficiency. With <b>common</b> <b>fluids,</b> the required disk spacing is dismally small causing using laminar flow to tend to be large and heavy for a prescribed throughflow rate.Extensive investigations have been made of Tesla-type liquid pumps using laminar-flow rotors. It was found that overall pump efficiency was low even when rotor efficiency was high because of the losses occurring at the rotor entrance and exit earlier mentioned. Modern multiple stage bladed turbines typically reach 60-70% efficiency, while large steam turbines often show turbine efficiency of over 90% in practice. Volute rotor matched Tesla-type machines of reasonable size with <b>common</b> <b>fluids</b> (steam, gas, and water) would also be expected to show efficiencies in the vicinity of 60-70% and possibly higher.|$|R
