30|$|In the {{intervention}} group, ED and intensive care physicians {{were asked to}} recommend a systematic ICU admission for all included patients. In case of unavailability of an ICU bed, another ICU bed had {{to be found in}} another or other hospital. In that case, patient’s transfer was done in priority in wards or centres participating in the study. If no ICU bed was available in participating wards/centres, patients could be transferred in a ward/centre not participating in the study. In these patients, the case report forms were <b>completed</b> <b>as</b> <b>appropriate.</b> All patients had to undergo a bedside evaluation by the intensive care attending physicians. The clinical case of all patients had to be systematically discussed between the ED and intensive care attending physicians. At the beginning of the trial, in-hospital meetings were organized with members of the scientific committee, ED and ICU staff to introduce and explain the trial. During the study period, there were monthly visits by clinical research nurses and ICU admission rates were presented during a twice-yearly investigators’ meetings and through newsletters.|$|R

30|$|The IMPA {{scale was}} {{developed}} {{in accordance with the}} FDA PROs guidance to measure the impact on ADLs attributable to physical impairments in individuals with juvenile MLD. It is a brief, content-valid scale designed to be <b>completed</b> by caregivers <b>as</b> <b>appropriate</b> patient surrogate responders based on their direct observations. Once comprehensive psychometric evaluation of the IMPA scale addresses the remaining requirements, the IMPA scale is expected to facilitate the evaluation of meaningful treatment benefit in clinical trials of new treatments for patients with juvenile MLD.|$|R
40|$|Existing {{models of}} privacy {{assume that the}} set of data to be held {{confidential}} is immutable. Unfortunately, that is often not the case. The need for privacy is balanced against the {{need to use the}} data, and the benefits that will accrue from the use of the data. We propose a model to balance privacy and utility of data. This model allows both the data provider and the data user to negotiate both requirements until a satisfactory balance is reached, or one (or both) determine such a balance cannot be reached. Thus, this model enables less than perfect privacy, or less than <b>complete</b> utility, <b>as</b> is <b>appropriate</b> for the particular circumstances under which the dat a was gathered and is being held, and the specific use to which it is to be put...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} early {{data from}} a qualitative longitudinal study of the first cohort of five students {{making the transition from}} teaching assistant in secondary school to specialist teacher of secondary mathematics. Data from a second cohort of four women and one man starting in 2003 is less <b>complete,</b> but used <b>as</b> <b>appropriate.</b> Bernstein's work on subject classification frames an argument that this student group navigates simultaneously two mathematics discourses: hard university mathematics, and everyday mathematics as experienced by the lower ability school pupils that the students support. This raises questions about the purpose and scope of the students work in school with respect to their mathematics learning, and vice versa. The study of conventional mathematics undergraduates for the ESRC (Macrae, Brown, and Rodd, 2003) provides a foil against which to compare approaches to learning mathematics, raising the possibility of a rethink of pre-requisite pre-qualification, and potential relations between university mathematics and work-place learning in secondary schools...|$|R
