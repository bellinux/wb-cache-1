30|$|In this section, we {{investigate}} a quantitative comparison of two VoIP scheduling schemes from the <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> <b>signaling</b> overhead point of view. However, {{in the proposed}} resource sharing scheme each paired user must know {{the authority of the}} shared resources to perform according to the proposed scenario. Therefore, one concern for the proposed scheme is the additional <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> <b>signals.</b> The paired user's control channel information for ACK/NACK channel needs to be once transmitted in the first time when the voice radio bearer is established. Therefore, the achievable capacity gains using the proposed scheduling are enough even if the additional <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> <b>signaling</b> overhead is taken into account, since the additional <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> <b>signals</b> are a very small quantity.|$|R
30|$|Since the eNB handles a {{large portion}} of VoIP users, the amount of the {{required}} <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> <b>signals</b> for voice services increases significantly. It is critical that the <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> <b>signaling</b> overhead is minimized as much as possible. Therefore, for voice services, this paper focuses on the persistent resource assignment with the static <b>control</b> <b>signaling.</b> The persistent scheduling is mainly aimed for the voice services. It has been discussed for E-UTRA as a solution to overcome the limitation of layer 1 /layer 2 (L 1 /L 2) control channels.|$|R

30|$|However, {{downlink}} <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> <b>signaling</b> {{is classified}} {{into two groups}} to support uplink services. The first group is used to indicate the assigned RB's information. It contains some user specific signals such as user identification (UEID), cyclic redundancy check (CRC), RB assigned frequency-domain location, assignment time-domain duration, modulation, coding, and payload size [2]. Also, this <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> <b>signaling</b> is required {{at the beginning of}} each first transmission TTI because of the synchronous HARQ in E-UTRA uplink. The second is used to assign RBs in order to apply ACK/NACK information for uplink data.|$|R

40|$|High-speed railway private {{cellular}} network provides voice and data services for passengers. It brings much signaling cost {{as a great}} many of mobile subscribers ask for location updating simultaneously. Moreover, it leads to plenty of <b>control</b> <b>signaling</b> <b>channel</b> requests. This paper presents two novel location updating schemes, that is, “clustering location management” and “mobile group location management” to solve the problems caused by the existing location updating scheme in high speed railway cellular private network. These two schemes can realize location updating without occupying more frequency resources. In addition, it does not impact the mobile subscribers’ paging. Then it analyses the performance of two improved schemes, such as channel request number of stand-alone dedicated control channel (SDCCH), average waiting time of location updating, cost of location updating, and paging. The result indicates that both schemes can utilize the SDCCH channel resource effectively...|$|R
40|$|A radiometer, {{practically}} {{insensitive to}} great {{fluctuations in the}} equipment amplification coefficient, was developed by dividing the useful signal by a reference signal and modulating the two signals at different frequencies. The signals are simultaneously separated by corresponding synchronous detectors and recorded over two channels. The operation is simplified by replacing the continuous signals by a sampling of discrete values, and using a digital computer. The four steps {{involved in the process}} are described and a block diagram is included. This technique not only directly connects the radiometer with the computer, but also records all data provided by the <b>control</b> and <b>signal</b> <b>channels...</b>|$|R
30|$|The PRB {{allocation}} of the Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH) is known a priori {{as defined by}} the standards. The UL <b>control</b> <b>signaling</b> on this <b>channel</b> is transmitted in a frequency region on the edges of the system BW. In parallel, the PRB {{allocation of}} other essential UL control channels, such as the RACH, can be extracted from the SIB messages.|$|R
30|$|By definition, the {{persistent}} assignment {{means that the}} resources are assigned by the eNB's persistent grant for a relatively {{long period of time}} (i.e., talk-spurt period). Once an allocation it is not changed regardless of channel quality and queue status except when entering silent period. It is not required to inform the scheduling L 1 /L 2 <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> <b>signals</b> except for the first establishing time [5, 6]. So it is very efficient for the <b>control</b> <b>signaling</b> overhead reduction. The eNB's scheduler can simply use the predefined persistent RBs in the allocated every TTI. The assigned resources are released only when the VoIP user at the talk-spurt state enters the silent state. During the silent period, the silent payloads are transmitted by using the conventional dynamic scheduling method. This is because the L 1 /L 2 <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> <b>signaling</b> overheads are not burden since the period of the silent frame is more than talk-spurt frame (i.e., 160 milliseconds).|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of MPT 1327 over TETRA is the increased availability, lower cost of equipment, {{the ease of}} installation, the familiarity with the equipment, and many believe that MPT 1327 is superior to TETRA, due to its uncompressed FM audio, and greater receiver sensitivity. MPT1327 <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> <b>signalling</b> is more resilient, since the TETRA protocol uses a complex modulation scheme that requires a far higher Signal to Noise ratio to function than 1,200 bit/s FFSK signalling.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Following {{the launch}} of the Pan-European digital mobile radio (GSM) system its salient {{features}} are surnrnarised in this tutorial review [I, 81. Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) with eight users per carrier is used at a multi-user rate of 27 1 kbit/s, demanding a channel equaliser to combat dispersion. The error protected chip-rate of the full-rate traffic channels is 22. 8 kbitls, while in half-rate channels is 11. 4 kbitls. There are two speech traffic channels, five different-rate data traffic channels and 14 various <b>control</b> and <b>signalling</b> <b>channels</b> to support the system's operation. A moderately complex, 13 kbitls Regular Pulse Excited speech codec with long term predictor (LTP) is used, combined with an embedded three-class error correction codec and multi-layer interleaving to provide sensitivity-matched unequal error protection for the speech bits. An overall speech delay of 57. 5 ms is maintained. Slow frequency hopping at 217 hopsls yields substantial performance gains for slowly moving pedestrians. 1...|$|R

We focus on the uplink, i. e., on communication from the mobile- to the base-station, and show how to minimise the variance of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) tracking error through incorporation of recursive filters. These filters complement existing power controllers and are designed by using a linear model which takes into account quantisation of the power <b>control</b> <b>signal,</b> dynamics of <b>channel</b> gains, interference from other users, target SIR, and SIR estimation errors.

40|$|Abstract—The {{advances}} in wireless communication have opened unlimited horizons {{but there are}} some challenges as well. The Nature derived air medium between MS (Mobile Station) and BS (Base Station) is beyond human control and produces channel impairment. The impact of the natural conditions at the air medium is the biggest issue in wireless communication. Natural conditions make reliability more cumbersome; here reliability refers to the efficient recovery of the lost or erroneous data. The SR-ARQ (Selective Repeat-Automatic Repeat Request) protocol is a de facto standard for any wireless technology at the air interface with its standard reliability features. Our focus in this research is on the reliability of the <b>control</b> or feedback <b>signal</b> of the SR-ARQ protocol. The proposed mechanism, RSR-ARQ (Reliable SR-ARQ) is an enhancement of the SR-ARQ protocol that has ensured the reliability of the <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> through <b>channel</b> impairment sensitive mechanism. We have modeled the system under two-state discrete time Markov Channel.

30|$|In {{order to}} perform the above process, one paired VoIP user in each pairing group only {{monitors}} the other paired user's ACK/NACK channel information. So, there is no burden for <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> <b>signaling</b> to change the transmitting authority adaptively. However, the rest resources, except for the shared resources for pairing groups, are used according to the original persistent scheduling rule. Moreover, if the only one user in a pairing group is staying alone because the other paired user's assigned resources are released, the remaining user can be operated according to the original persistent configurations.|$|R
5000|$|When all {{channels}} at a VOC enabled site are in use, or {{a single}} channel site gets a call request, there is specific data sent out over the control channel to notify all radios at the site that the control channel will be momentarily switching to voice channel mode. Once this happens radios resort to their programmed information which contains timing values that determine what to do once the timer runs out {{and there is still}} no <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> (<b>Signal</b> [...] "Out of Range," [...] switch sites, etc.) available.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} control channels are used so that adjacent base stations do not interfere with one another, and the mobile stations scan the different channels to locate the strongest <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> <b>signal.</b> In addition to this there are the traffic channels. The specification supports up to 1,024 different traffic channels to be used. In this way a base station can support a large {{number of different}} mobile stations that are communicating at the same time. However, for small systems with only a few channels, the control channel may also act as a non-dedicated traffic channel.|$|R
30|$|As {{a method}} to reduce such <b>control</b> <b>signaling</b> overhead, {{persistent}} scheduling scheme has been investigated in [5, 6]. By use of the inherent characteristics of voice traffic such as frame size and period, the scheme efficiently reduced <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> <b>signaling</b> overhead. With the aid of such overhead reduction, the persistent scheduling scheme has been discussed as an option for VoIP services in E-UTRA uplink. However, such persistent resource allocation makes lack of early-termination gain, bringing about the waste of frequency resources with the reduced fairness of users. This is because the allocated resources through this persistent scheduling scheme (i.e., the TTI and frequency resource block (RB)-index) are assigned to each VoIP user for a relatively {{long period of time}} without changes. Accordingly, the persistent scheduling scheme could limit the capacity of VoIP service using LTE system, and thus more efficient scheduling should be required.|$|R
40|$|Form factor {{constraints}} often limit mobile {{clients to}} a single antenna, resulting in mobile devices having fewer antennas than Access Points (APs). This antenna asymmetry restricts uplink throughput to the client antenna array size rather than the AP’s. Antenna asymmetry can subsequently limit spatial multiplexing gains for transmissions between the client and AP. In this thesis, I design, implement and experimentally evaluate two standard compliant solutions that enable multiplexing gains in uplink transmissions for both single-user and multi-user paradigms. I first introduce MUSE, the first distributed and scalable system to achieve full-rank uplink multi-user capacity without <b>control</b> <b>signaling</b> for <b>channel</b> estimation, channel reporting, or user selection. Second, I design, implement, and experimentally evaluate Chameleon, the first system to enable uplink spatial multiplexing for a single-user with a single antenna. In Chameleon, clients spoof an unmodified AP to infer that the single-antenna client has an array and spatial multiplexing capabilities. My experiments demonstrate full-rank multiplexing gains are achieved in both single-user and multi-user paradigms. The results show performance scaling, as the system gains increase with the number spatial streams, while I still maintain standard compatibility...|$|R
30|$|Although the {{persistent}} scheduling is very efficient {{to reduce the}} overheads of L 1 /L 2 <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> <b>signals,</b> it is very inefficient to achieve some dynamic scheduling benefits such as early-termination gain and channel-dependent scheduling. The early-termination gain means that the allocated resources, which are assigned to a scheduled user, can be potentially available to other user {{when they are not}} used by the allocated user. It may be efficient in resource utilization. But, in the original persistent scheduling scheme, the allocated resources are not changed during the talk-spurt period. In other words, since the original persistent scheduling does not provide the early-termination gain, the available capacity of VoIP is limited. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} a solution to improve the available VoIP capacity.|$|R

30|$|This {{category}} either use {{of one of}} {{the white}} spaces as the control channel or use a different band other than ISM to exchange control information before actually starting the communication. The synchronized MAC protocol for multi-hop cognitive radio networks (SYNC-MAC) (Kondareddy and Agrawal 2008) chooses one of the common channels with neighbours to exchange <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> while other <b>channels</b> are selected to send data. In the opportunistic-cognitive MAC (OC-MAC) (Hung et al. 2008), initially all nodes reside on a non-GCCC and to select a data channel from the FCL three-way handshake is performed followed by the acknowledgement of data transmission. In OC-MAC length of the spectrum hole is predicted by the CR nodes. We strongly criticize this because in order to calculate the length of available spectrum hole, first the exact time interval during which the PU is not utilizing the spectrum needs to be found, which is very difficult in case of an opportunistic network. The cognitive MAC protocol for multi-channel wireless networks (Cordeiro and Challapali 2007) selects the so-called R channel within the white spaces for a control channel and manages the communication on the R channel. However, the selection criteria for the control channel have not been clearly described. The paper also lacks the clarification about which node will set the control channel and how the other nodes will be synchronized.|$|R

30|$|We {{design the}} MDs by {{explicitly}} exploiting the layered {{construction of the}} <b>control</b> <b>signals.</b> In particular, we first generate a quantized control vector based {{on the principles of}} PPC.

The descriptions are constructed so that the current <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> and J− 1 future <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> can be obtained by combining any subset of J∈{ 1,, M} descriptions. Thus, the more packets that are received at the plant, the more future plant predictions become available.
