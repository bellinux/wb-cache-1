In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence advises that the diet should not be recommended for adults with epilepsy. About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the ketogenic diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults. Some clinicians consider the two less restrictive dietary variants—the low glycaemic index treatment and the modified Atkins diet—to be more appropriate for adolescents and adults. A liquid form of the ketogenic diet is particularly easy to prepare for, and well tolerated by, infants on formula and children who are tube-fed.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A good <b>clinical</b> <b>guideline</b> for {{integrated}} traditional Chinese and Western medicine (ITCWM) {{should be}} established by multi-subject specialists, including clinical expert of ITCWM, traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and medical staff from different levels of health care organization, clinical and preclinical medicine researcher, statistician, clinical epidemiologist and economist, medical decision-maker and administrative expert. Establishment of guideline should be abided by the following scientific procedure: association of ITCWM (AITCWM) or the branch of AITCWM decides the subject of <b>clinical</b> <b>guideline,</b> set up a team of special subject of <b>clinical</b> <b>guideline</b> (or decided by research project), evaluate literature systematically, prepare a draft manuscript, consult and appraise {{it in the same}} occupation, announce the content in the academic circle, collect feedback opinions and proposals and then make analysis, modify the <b>clinical</b> <b>guideline,</b> publish the <b>clinical</b> <b>guideline,</b> apply the <b>clinical</b> <b>guideline,</b> collect and appraise feedback opinions and proposals, modify and consummate the <b>clinical</b> <b>guideline.</b> In order to supply and consummate original guideline, scientific and renewed evidence should be emphasized on the basis of evidence-based medicine. The author also suggested insistence on the combination of disease and syndrome, syndrome being governed by disease, standardization of syndrome type, establishment of reasonable amount of syndrome types, standard and method of modifying the treatment. The user of guideline should pay attention to both the principle and flexibility, and the author stressed that guideline was just a diagnosis and treatment reference to clinician, which should be used flexibly and not be imitated mechanically in practical application. The practicability of guideline should be pay attention to so that the clinician can apply and manipulate the guideline easily. Meanwhile, the group of guideline establishment has an obligation to train medical staff and to promote the practice of <b>clinical</b> <b>guideline.</b> Only in this way, the authority, standardization and applicability of <b>clinical</b> <b>guideline</b> on ITCWM can be ensured, and then the expected purpose of <b>clinical</b> <b>guideline</b> establishment can be attained...|$|R
5|$|Guidelines {{issued by}} the UK-based National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), carried out a {{systematic}} review using different methodology {{and came to a}} different conclusion. They questioned the accuracy of studies that were not placebo-controlled. And, based on the findings of placebo-controlled studies, they do not recommend use of benzodiazepines beyond two to four weeks, as tolerance and physical dependence develop rapidly, with withdrawal symptoms including rebound anxiety occurring after six weeks or more of use. Nevertheless, benzodiazepines are still prescribed for long-term treatment of anxiety disorders, although specific antidepressants and psychological therapies are recommended as the first-line treatment options with the anticonvulsant drug pregabalin indicated as a second- or third-line treatment and suitable for long-term use. NICE stated that long-term use of benzodiazepines for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia is an unlicensed indication, does not have long-term efficacy, and is, therefore, not recommended by <b>clinical</b> <b>guidelines.</b> Psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy are recommended as a first-line therapy for panic disorder; benzodiazepine use has been found to interfere with therapeutic gains from these therapies.|$|E

40|$|Background: Effective <b>clinical</b> {{practice}} <b>guidelines</b> {{should improve}} <b>clinical</b> outcomes, {{and measures of}} physician use of <b>clinical</b> practice <b>guidelines</b> should correlate with improved outcomes. This study translates a <b>clinical</b> practice <b>guideline</b> on heart failure into review criteria to measure physician performance {{and the effectiveness of}} the <b>clinical</b> practice <b>guideline.</b> Methods: A panel of 11 family physicians and 1 cardiologist systematically reviewed the <b>clinical</b> practice <b>guideline</b> for its <b>clinical</b> importance, educational relevance, and evaluative appropriateness. Then a subset of 4 family physicians rigorously applied each recommendation to established criteria for measurability and developed an evaluation tool useful in medical record review. Results: The heart failure <b>clinical</b> practice <b>guideline</b> was found to be an excellent educational tool. Using it to measure physician performance, however, was limited to diagnostic tests and drug prescribing. Of 45 recommendations, 5 fulfilled criteria for measurability; 1 recommendation had A-level evidence, whereas 2 recommendations had B-level and 2 had C-level evidence.

25|$|Serious {{research}} to test chiropractic theories {{did not begin}} until the 1970s, and is continuing to be hampered by antiscientific and pseudoscientific ideas that sustained the profession in its long battle with organized medicine. By the mid 1990s there was a growing scholarly interest in chiropractic, which helped efforts to improve service quality and establish <b>clinical</b> <b>guidelines</b> that recommended manual therapies for acute low back pain. In recent decades chiropractic gained legitimacy and greater acceptance by medical physicians and health plans, and enjoyed a strong political base and sustained demand for services. However, its future seemed uncertain: {{as the number of}} practitioners grew, evidence-based medicine insisted on treatments with demonstrated value, managed care restricted payment, and competition grew from massage therapists and other health professions. The profession responded by marketing natural products and devices more aggressively, and by reaching deeper into alternative medicine and primary care.|$|E
25|$|Antianxiety agents (benzodiazepines): Use of benzodiazepines for panic {{disorder}} is controversial with opinion differing {{in the medical}} literature. The American Psychiatric Association states that benzodiazepines can be effective {{for the treatment of}} {{panic disorder}} and recommends that the choice of whether to use benzodiazepines, antidepressants with anti-panic properties or psychotherapy should be based on the individual patient's history and characteristics. Other experts believe that benzodiazepines are best avoided due to the risks of the development of tolerance and physical dependence. The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry, say that benzodiazepines should not be used as a first-line treatment option but are an option for treatment-resistant cases of panic disorder. Despite increasing focus on the use of antidepressants and other agents for the treatment of anxiety as recommended best practice, benzodiazepines have remained a commonly used medication for panic disorder. They reported that in their view there is insufficient evidence to recommend one treatment over another for panic disorder. The APA noted that while benzodiazepines have the advantage of a rapid onset of action, that this is offset by the risk of developing a benzodiazepine dependence. The National Institute of Clinical Excellence came to a different conclusion, they pointed out the problems of using uncontrolled clinical trials to assess the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy and based on placebo-controlled research they concluded that benzodiazepines were not effective in the long-term for panic disorder and recommended that benzodiazepines not be used for longer than 4 weeks for panic disorder. Instead NICE <b>clinical</b> <b>guidelines</b> recommend alternative pharmacotherapeutic or psychotherapeutic interventions.|$|E
