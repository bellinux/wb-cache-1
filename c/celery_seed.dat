40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: A facile {{route to}} perillyl alcohol (POH) {{differential}} glycosylation {{and the corresponding}} synthesis {{of a set of}} 34 POH glycosides is reported. Subsequent in vitro studies revealed a sugar dependent antiproliferative activity and the inhibition of S 6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation as a putative mechanism of representative POH glycosides. The most active glycoside from this cumulative study (4 ′-azido-D-glucoside, PG 9) represents one of the most cytotoxic POH analogues reported to date. (S) -Perillyl alcohol (POH, also known as p-metha- 1, 8 -diene- 7 -ol or 4 -isopropenyl cyclohexene carbinol) is a monoterpene produced by a number of plants, including cherries, lavendin, mints, and <b>celery</b> <b>seeds</b> via oxidative modification of D...|$|R

Bengali cooking includes the phoron of a combination of whole spices, fried and added at the start or finish of cooking as a flavouring special to each dish. Bengalis share their use of whole black mustard seeds with South Indians, but unique to Bengal is the extensive use of freshly ground mustard paste. A pungent mustard paste called Kashundi is a dipping sauce popular in Bengal.|$|R

Vegetable ingredients (not including the potatoes) are diced or chopped and incorporated raw. The salad is often topped with paprika and chives, and generally served cold or at room temperature.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim was {{to purify}} and characterise an {{antimicrobial}} component from <b>celery</b> (Apium graveolens) <b>seeds,</b> which {{have been used for}} centuries as a herbal medicine with reported antibacterial effects. Methods: A crude alcoholic extract of <b>celery</b> <b>seeds</b> was fractionated by organic solvent extractions, column chromatography and HPLC. Fractions were assayed for antimicrobial activity against the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori and other bacteria. The purified antibacterial component was characterised via MS and NMR. Preliminary investigation of its mechanism of action included morphological studies, incorporation of macromolecular precursors, membrane integrity and two-dimensional protein electrophoresis. Key findings: The purified component, termed `compound with anti-Helicobacter activity' (CAH), had potent bactericidal effects against H. pylori; the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration were 3. 15 [*]μg/ml and 6. 25 - 12. 5 [*]μg/ml, respectively. CAH (Mr = 384. 23; empirical formula C 24 H 32 O 4) had specific inhibitory effects on H. pylori and was not active against Campylobacter jejuni or Escherichia coli. MS and NMR data were consistent with a dimeric phthalide structure. The results appeared to rule out mechanisms that operated solely by loss of membrane integrity or inhibition of protein or nucleic acid synthesis. Conclusions: CAH may be suitable for further investigation as a potent agent for treating H. pylori infections...|$|R
50|$|Shijiazhuang Pharma Group: Based in Shijiazhuang, {{the capital}} city of Hebei Province in {{northeast}} China, the pharma group {{is one of the largest}} pharma industries of China. In November 2004, the group announced the official launch of its investigative drug butylphthalide (NBP).

40|$|Plants {{have been}} widely used as {{protective}} agents against a wide variety of processes and compounds that damage tissues via free radical mechanisms. Perillyl alcohol (PA) is a naturally occurring monoterpene found in the essential oils of numerous species of plants including mints, cherries and <b>celery</b> <b>seeds.</b> This monocyclic monoterpene has shown antioxidant and therapeutic activity in various studies against various xenobiotics. In this study, we have analyzed the effects of PA against single intraperitoneal dose of ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA) (9 mg iron per kg body weight) -induced nephrotoxicity and early tumor promotional events. The pretreatment of Fe-NTA-treated rats with 0. 5 % per kg body weight dose and 1 % per kg body weight dose of PA for seven consecutive days significantly reversed the Fe-NTA-induced malondialdehyde formation, xanthine oxidase activity (P < 0. 001), ornithine decarboxylase activity (P < 0. 001) and 3 [H]thymidine incorporation in renal DNA (P < 0. 001) with simultaneous significant depletion in serum toxicity markers blood urea nitrogen and creatinine (P < 0. 001). Significant restoration at both the doses was recorded in depleted renal glutathione content, and its dependent enzymes with prophylactic treatment of PA. Present results suggest that PA potentially attenuates against Fe-NTA-induced oxidative damage and tumor promotional events that preclude its development as a future drug to avert the free radical-induced toxicity...|$|R

40|$|Rate of {{development}} and biological features of Graphosoma lineatum was studied under laboratory conditions of 28 ± 2 °C, 60 ± 5 % R. H. and a photoperiod of 16 : 8 (L:D) feeding the individual insects upon seeds of 5 umbelliferous species namely parsley, fennel, dill, celery and carrot. The results indicated no significant differences regarding the duration of embryonic development in rearings on 5 already mentioned food regimes. The lowest mean larval developmental time, from egg to egg and from egg to adult stages in rearings on dill seeds was estimated as 19. 73, 36. 30 and 25. 47 days, respectively with the highest mean records being as 26. 89, 45. 3 and 32. 39 days in rearings on <b>celery</b> <b>seeds.</b> Regarding the percentage egg hatches, {{there was no significant}} differences between 5 treatments. The mean survival rate from first instars larval stage into adult varied from 67. 53 - 46. 66 % between 5 treatments. The mean number of eggs laid in the rearings on carrot was 99. 1 with 79 being in rearings on celery. It was indicated that feeding on carrot seeds resulted in highest survival rate, lowest larval developmental stages and lowest total life cycle. The number of eggs laid by adult females reared on carrot seeds appeared to be higher than on other seeds, lowering in rearing on dill, fennel, parsley and celery, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Intercropping leek (Allium porrum L.) {{and celery}} (Apium graveolens L.) was {{recognized}} as an option to reduce growth and reproductive potential of weeds while maintaining yield and product quality of both crops on a high level. To optimise the intercropping system for yield, quality and weed suppression a combined use of mechanistic and descriptive models, together with experimental work, was applied. An eco-physiological model was used to improve understanding of interplant competition based on physiological, morphological and phenological processes. The model was parameterised based on characteristics of the plants in monocultures and its performance was evaluated for the crop mixtures using experimental data from different growing seasons. After validation the model was used to simulate biomass production and quality of leek, <b>celery</b> and <b>seed</b> production of Common Groundsel (Senecio vulgaris L.) {{for a wide range}} of crop densities and times of weed emergence. In a second step, the results of the simulations where summarized using a descriptive hyperbolic yield-density model, which then allowed evaluation of the intercropping system in terms of productivity, product quality, and the ability to suppress weeds. The paper will explain this combined modelling approach and how it was used to design and optimise the leek-celery intercropping system. Moreover, this study shows that functional biodiversity, as represented by the intercropping system, can contribute to the improvement of the economical potential while increasing the sustainability of highly developed agricultural production systems...|$|R
40|$|Submerged aquatic {{vegetation}} (SAV) {{has declined}} recipitously throughout coastal areas and its reestablishment {{has long been}} an important objective of coastal management. We investigated restoration success of Vallisneria americana (wild <b>celery)</b> using <b>seeds,</b> seed pods, and whole shoot transplants at sites in the Chesapeake Bay in the United States where historical aerial photography has indicated that the species once grew. In addition, we evaluated habitat conditions and established herbivore exclosures to assess the impacts of water quality, sediment conditions, and grazers on planting success. Whole shoot transplants resulted in the most rapid cover of the bottom, but required greater planting effort. Direct dispersal of individual seeds was generally more successful than dispersal of intact seed pods, resulting in more rapid initial seedling growth. Overall, 100 % bottom cover of whole shoot transplant plots could be reached in approximately 3 years, despite light attenuation coefficients (Kd) of 3. 0 to 4. 0. Transplants at shallow depths (< 0. 5 m) were able to rapidly grow and elongate to the surface at mid-to-low tidal heights. Transplants were successful in both muddy (8 % organic) and sandy (< 2 %) substrates. Using mesh exclosures to protect the plants from herbivory was critical to restoration success. Although water quality and other habitat conditions are important for SAV growth and survival, restoration in the unvegetated areas studied here was limited by grazing of initial recruits. The establishment of protected founder colonies of sufficient size to withstand initial grazing pressures may be required to reestablish SAV in similar areas...|$|R
