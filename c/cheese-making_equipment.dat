Frailing and quickly outgrew the original building. Frailing built this new, larger creamery building in 1920. A rear wing housing <b>cheese-making</b> <b>equipment</b> was added in 1941. The Iron River Creamery was sold to the Fairmont Food Company in 1957, and the building was eventually occupied by the Bigari Electric and Refrigeration Company.|$|E

5000|$|These {{products}} are {{sometimes referred to}} as [...] "analogue pizza cheese". They are used on some commercially produced pizzas. They may be formulated for processing with basic <b>cheese-making</b> <b>equipment,</b> but without the additional equipment and processing that mozzarella cheese requires, such as the processes of mixing and molding. They tend to have a soft texture and once melted, may have a slightly [...] "stringy" [...] quality when pulled or bitten into. They may lack in a fusion, or melt together when cooked.It has been stated that pizza cheese appears to be the leading type of cheese analogue produced globally. In 1987 it was asserted that—at that time—each year in the United States over 700 million frozen pizzas were sold, three quarters of which contain cheese substitutes.|$|E
