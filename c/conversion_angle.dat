40|$|Authors {{are almost}} {{unanimous}} regarding the ratios between reflected and {{incident plane wave}} amplitudes obtained through the condition of zero traction at a free surface, except for grazing waves. Goodier and Bishop showed that the traditional approach fails in cases of wave travels grazing the surface. The writer argues that the traditional theory fails also for incidence angles beyond that where the total mode conversion from P-wave to S-wave occurs, and also shows that after this angle, phase inversion no longer occurs. The reason for this behavior is that plane waves are characterized by some constraints between their fundamental modes of strain. These constraints are {{set up by the}} waveguide equations presented by the writer. It then happens that it does not exist a set of incident and reflected plane waves that can fulfils the condition of zero traction at the reflecting surface. Therefore some scattering of the incident wave is supposed to occur near the free boundary. The equation of conservation of flux of energy together with the equations of zero traction at surface, are not sufficient for determining the nature of this scattering. The writer hence appeals also to the strain compatibility equation at the free surface and obtains an expression for the reflecting P-wave that agrees with the results of Goodier and Bishop. It is remarkable that the angle of total mode conversion is preserved. New curves of reflections are proposed. The P-wave reflection curve little differs from the traditional up to the total mode <b>conversion</b> <b>angle</b> but completely differs between this up to the grazing angle. The S-wave to P-wave reflection ratio almost follows the traditional. Waves are represented through the superposition of the four fundamental modes of the plane areolar strain theory of elasticity.

40|$|The {{physical}} model test of landslides {{is important for}} studying landslide structural damage, and parameter measurement is key in this process. To meet the measurement requirements for deep displacement in landslide {{physical model}}s, an automatic flexible inclinometer probe with good coupling and large deformation capacity was designed. The flexible inclinometer probe consists of several gravity acceleration sensing units that are protected and positioned by silicon encapsulation, all the units are connected to a 485 -comunication bus. By sensing the two-axis tilt angle, the direction and magnitude of the displacement for a measurement unit can be calculated, then the overall displacement is accumulated according to all units, integrated from bottom to top in turn. In the <b>conversion</b> from <b>angle</b> to displacement, two spline interpolation methods are introduced to correct and resample the data; one is to interpolate the displacement after conversion, {{and the other is}} to interpolate the angle before conversion; compared with the result read from checkered paper, the latter is proved to have a better effect, with an additional condition that the displacement curve move up half the length of the unit. The flexible inclinometer is verified with respect to its principle and arrangement by a laboratory physical model test, and the test results are highly consistent with the actual deformation of the landslide model...|$|R

The system is based on a capacitance to phase <b>angle</b> <b>conversion</b> method. Water content is measured with a capacitance sensor comprising two semi-cylindrical electrodes mounted on the outer side of a glass tube. The presence of water induces a capacitance change that in turn converts into a phase angle, with respect to a main oscillator. A differential sensing technique is adopted not only to ensure high immunity against temperature variation and background noise, but also to eliminate phase jitter and amplitude variation of the main oscillator that could destabilize the output. The complete capacitive sensing system was implemented in hardware and experiment results using crude oil samples demonstrated that a resolution of ± 50 ppm of water content in crude oil was achieved by the proposed design...|$|R
40|$|Weak lensing (WL) {{clustering}} is studied using 2 D (angular) coordinates, while redshift space distortions (RSD) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) use 3 D coordinates, {{which requires}} a model dependent <b>conversion</b> of <b>angles</b> and redshifts into comoving distances. This is the first paper of a series, which explore modelling multi-tracer galaxy clustering (of WL, BAO and RSD), using only angular (2 D) cross-correlations in thin redshift bins. This involves evaluating many thousands cross-correlations, each a multidimensional integral, which is computationally demanding. We present a new algorithm that performs these calculations as matrix operations. Nearby narrow redshift bins are intrinsically correlated, {{which can be used}} to recover the full (radial) 3 D information. We show that the Limber approximation does not work well for this task. In the exact calculation, both the clustering amplitude and the RSD effect increase when decreasing the redshift bin width. For narrow bins, the cross-correlations has a larger BAO peak than the auto-correlation because smaller scales are filtered out by the radial redshift separation. Moreover, the BAO peak shows a second (ghost) peak, shifted to smaller angles. We explore how WL, RSD and BAO contribute to the cross-correlations {{as a function of the}} redshift bin width and present a first exploration of non-linear effects and signal-to-noise ratio on these quantities. This illustrates that the new approach to clustering analysis provides new insights and is potentially viable in practice...|$|R
50|$|<b>Conversion</b> to the <b>angle</b> of {{disparity}} dγ {{is performed}} by inserting the position difference dz in the formulawhere a is the interocular {{separation of the}} observer and z {{the distance of the}} fixed peg from the eye. To transfer dγ into the usual unit of minutes of arc, a multiplicative constant c is inserted whose value is 3437.75 (1 radian in arcminutes). In the calculation a, dz and z must be in the same units, say, feet, inches, cm or meters. For the average interocular distance of 6.5 cm, a target distance of 6m and a typical stereoacuity of 0.5 minute of arc, the just detectable depth interval is 8 cm. As targets come closer, this interval gets smaller by the inverse square of the distance, so that an equivalent detectable depth interval at ¼ meter is 0.01 cm or the depth of impression of the head on a coin. These very small values of normal stereoacuity, expressed in differences of either object distances, or angle of disparity, makes it a hyperacuity.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of grain formation during equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE) in a 2219 Al alloy {{has been studied}} at intermediate and high temperatures. It was shown that continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) occurred during intense plastic straining and resulted {{in the formation of}} submicrometer grains at temperatures ranging from 250 C to 300 C. Higher temperatures (< 300 C) hindered CDRX. This is caused by the fact that nucleation controls CDRX in the aluminum alloy. Dislocation rearrangements result in the formation of low angle boundary networks at moderate strain. The density of lattice dislocations determines the rate of subgrain formation. In addition, at lower temperatures a low energy dislocation structure (LEDS) forms concurrently with the subgrain structure and stabilizes it. The stability of the subgrain structure is very important for the resulting <b>conversion</b> of low <b>angle</b> boundaries into high angle ones with strain by extensive accumulation of mobile lattice dislocations. Increasing temperature in the range of intermediate temperatures suppresses LEDS formation and decreases the lattice dislocation density. This reduces the rate of the subgrain formation process and CDRX. As a result, at T = 400 C no recrystallized grains were found. At T = 475 C, the new grains form due to geometric dynamic recrystallization (GRX) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews {{advanced}} radar architectures {{that employ}} multiple transmit and multiple receive antennas {{to improve the}} performance of future synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems. These advanced architectures have been dubbed multiple-input multiple-output SAR (MIMO-SAR) in analogy to MIMO communication systems. Considerable confusion arose, however, {{with regard to the}} selection of suitable waveforms for the simultaneous transmission via multiple channels. It is shown that the mere use of orthogonal waveforms is insufficient for the desired performance improvement in view of most SAR applications. As a solution to this fundamental MIMO-SAR challenge, a new class of short-term shift-orthogonal waveforms is introduced. The short-term shift orthogonality avoids mutual interferences from the radar echoes of closely spaced scatterers, while interferences from more distant scatterers are suppressed by digital beamforming on receive in elevation. Further insights can be gained by considering the data acquisition of a side-looking imaging radar in a three-dimensional information cube. It becomes evident that the suggested waveforms fill different subspaces that can be individually accessed by a multi-channel receiver. For completeness, the new class of short-term shift-orthogonal waveforms is also compared to a recently proposed pair of OFDM waveforms. It is shown that both sets of waveforms require essentially the same principle of range time to elevation <b>angle</b> <b>conversion</b> via a multi-channel receiver in order to be applicable for MIMO-SAR imaging without interference...|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the results from}} a wind tunnel test of a 1 / 6 th scale Variable Diameter Tiltrotor (VDTR). This test was a joint effort of NASA Ames and Sikorsky Aircraft. The objective was to evaluate the aeroelastic and performance characteristics of the VDTR in conversion, hover, and cruise. The rotor diameter and nacelle angle of the model were remotely changed to represent tiltrotor operating conditions. Data is presented showing the propulsive force required in <b>conversion,</b> blade loads, <b>angle</b> of attack stability and simulated gust response, and hover and cruise performance. This test represents the first wind tunnel test of a variable diameter rotor applied to a tiltrotor concept. The results confirm some of the potential advantages of the VDTR and establish the variable diameter rotor a viable candidate for an advanced tiltrotor. This wind tunnel test successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the Variable Diameter rotor for tilt rotor aircraft. A wide range of test points were taken in hover, conversion, and cruise modes. The concept was shown to {{have a number of}} advantages over conventional tiltrotors such as reduced hover downwash with lower disk loading and significantly reduced longitudinal gust response in cruise.

40|$|This thesis {{outlines}} the implementation and commissioning of a LabVIEW based, dual axis solar tracking system located within Murdoch University’s Renewable Energy Outdoor Test Area. An electrical {{system that is}} capable of supplying power to the solar tracking hardware and protecting it from the effects of overcurrent has been designed, installed and tested according to several Australian Standards including the AS 3000 Wiring Rules. The testing of the electrical system proved that the installation was both safe and reliable and as such it was connected to the existing Murdoch University electricity grid. The commissioning of the solar tracking hardware proved to be problematic with various issues delaying the progression of the project including damage to one of the main servomotors resulting in the need for a replacement motor, corruption of VSD parameter files and the transposition of phases during the connection of one of the motors. A plan for testing the accuracy of the solar tracking LabVIEW program was developed using a pyrheliometer. Extensive testing was carried out on the tracker which ultimately confirmed the accuracy of the solar positioning algorithm. However, it was discovered that further <b>angle</b> <b>conversions</b> will need to take place {{in order to make the}} software useable on a fixed east-west primary axis solar array.

40|$|Acoustic {{waves are}} {{generated}} by the convective motions in the solar convection zone. When propagating upwards into the chromosphere they reach the height where the sound speed equals the Alfvén speed and they undergo mode conversion, refraction and reflection. We use numerical simulations to study these processes in realistic configurations where the wavelength of the waves {{is similar to the}} length scales of the magnetic field. Even though this regime is outside the validity of previous analytic studies or studies using ray-tracing theory, we show that some of their basic results remain valid: the critical quantity for mode <b>conversion</b> is the <b>angle</b> between the magnetic field and the k-vector: the attack angle. At angles smaller than 308 much of the acoustic, fast mode from the photosphere is transmitted as an acoustic, slow mode propagating along the field lines. At larger angles, most of the energy is refracted/reflected and returns as a fast mode creating an interference pattern between the upward and downward propagating waves. In three-dimensions, this interference between waves at small angles creates patterns with large horizontal phase speeds, especially close to magnetic field concentrations. When damping from shock dissipation and radiation is taken into account, the waves in the low–mid chromosphere have mostly the character of upward propagating acoustic waves and it is only close to the reflecting layer we get similar amplitudes for the upward propagating and refracted/reflected waves. The oscillatory power is suppressed in magnetic field concentrations and enhanced in ring-formed patterns around them. The complex interference patterns caused by mode-conversion, refraction and reflection, even with simple incident waves and in simple magnetic field geometries, make direct inversion of observables exceedingly difficult. In a dynamic chromosphere it is doubtful if the determination of mean quantities is even meaningful...|$|R
