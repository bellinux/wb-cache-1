40|$|Driving {{and timing}} chains {{are widely used}} machine {{elements}} which are continuously improved regarding wear and energy efficiency. Especially for timing chains, reducing wear is of high importance as the chain is critical for {{the function of the}} combustion engine. To achieve this goal, the wear within the <b>chain</b> <b>joint</b> has to be measured precisely which is usually done by measuring the length of the entire chain. With this measurement, no information about the distribution of wear between the contacting bodies, pin and bush, is available. An additional measuring and analyzing technique using a standard roundness instrument is developed with which more detailed information about the wear within the <b>chain</b> <b>joint</b> is obtained. With this new method, unworn <b>chain</b> <b>joint</b> components are characterized and the wear on worn components is measured and compared for pins with different surface treatments.

40|$|Abstract — Considerable {{attention}} {{to coordinate the}} system between buyer and vendor has become an interesting issue to efficiently increase the performance of supply chain activities. Joint economic lot size model (JELS) has been introduced by many researchers as the spirit of coordinating the flow of material from the vendor to its downstream. As an inventory replenishment technique, JELS model is centered on reducing joint total cost of vendor and buyer by simultaneously deciding optimal delivery lot size, number of deliveries, and batch production lot. It is appropriate {{to take into account}} transportation costs as the function shipping weight and distance since delivery lot size has interrelated with shipping weight. Hence, this study constitutes an effort to develop the model of JELS by incorporating transportation cost. The solution procedure of the model is developed for solving two problems which are incapacitated and capacitated model. In addition, numerical examples were provided to illustrate the feasibility of the solution procedure in deriving optimal solution. The result presents central decision making which is useful for coordination and collaboration between vendor and buyer. Index Terms—Supply <b>chain,</b> <b>Joint</b> economic lot size...|$|E
40|$|Animal manures {{are major}} sources of {{nutrients}} and organic matter, {{to be used to}} fertilize crops and improve soil quality. However, when not properly managed, these manures release considerable amounts of ammonia (NH 3), nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4) into the air, and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to water bodies, which create a range of unwanted environment impacts. Nutrient losses from manure depend on the management activities and techniques used at different stages of the whole manure management chain, from animal feeding up to manure application to land. The trade-offs and co-benefits of emission mitigation measures and manure treatment technologies are as yet poorly understood, especially when taking the whole manure management chain into account. Moreover, the effects of combinations of measures and technologies have not been well analyzed, and analyses at national scales are lacking. The overall objective of this PhD thesis research is (i) to enhance the quantitative insight into the effects of emission mitigation measures and treatment technologies on emissions of NH 3, N 2 O and CH 4, and the recovery of N and P from animal manure in the whole management chain, and (ii) to explore the effects of combinations of measures and technologies to mitigate these emissions and to increase the N and P recovery. In Chapter 2, methodologies for estimating N excretion factors for the main animal categories in member states of the European Union (EU) were reviewed. In Chapter 3, a transparent and uniform methodology for estimating annual feed use and N excretion per animal category for all countries of the EU- 27 was developed, based on the energy and protein requirements of the animals and statistics of feed use and composition, animal number and productivity. In Chapter 4, firstly the impacts of a suite of NH 3 mitigation measures on emissions of NH 3, N 2 O and CH 4 at individual stages of the manure management chain were analyzed by means of a meta-analysis of published data. Secondly, the overall impacts of alternative combinations of mitigation measures on emissions from the whole chain were evaluated through scenario analysis. Chapter 5 reports on an integrated assessment of the effects of manure treatment on NH 3, N 2 O and CH 4 emissions from manure management chains in EU- 27 at the national level for 2010, using the model MITERRA-Europe. Whole-chain effects of implementing twelve treatment technologies in EU- 27 on emissions and N and P recovery were further explored through scenario analyses. Chapter 6 reports on a survey conducted under various stakeholder groups with expertise in the domain of manure treatment in four European countries that have regions of high animal density. The survey addressed questions related to i) which factors facilitate and hinder the implementation of treatment technologies in practice, ii) which technologies have the most potential for successful adoption, and iii) how farm characteristics and the scale of the treatment operation affect priorities for adoption. The main conclusions of this PhD thesis are as follows: In EU- 27, the amounts of N and P in manure are as large as or larger than the total amounts of fertilizer N and P used annually. However, there is a huge spatial variation in manure production. Nutrient excretion factors per animal category also vary between countries, as a result of variations in feed use and animal productivity. Clearly, for accurate inventories of national emission {{there is a need for}} estimating nutrient excretion using country-specific feed use data. Increasing the effectiveness of measures to mitigate NH 3 and GHG emissions from animal manure requires proper combination of measures in the manure management chain. Lowering the dietary protein content in animal feed is an effective measure to reduce NH 3 emissions and other N emissions at all stages of the manure management chain. Other measures may reduce emissions of a specific gas or emissions source, by which there is a risk of unwanted trade-offs in the manure management <b>chain.</b> <b>Joint</b> adoption of these measures with low-N feeding strategies and slurry acidification can greatly decrease the risk of pollution swapping. Implementation of manure treatment is on average still limited in EU- 27. Effects of manure treatment on NH 3 and GHG emissions are therefore relatively small at EU level. Increasing the implementation of treatment technologies, including acidification, incineration and thermal drying, or optimized combinations of treatment technologies, can significantly contribute to achieving NH 3 and GHG emission targets of EU environmental policies. Implementation of manure treatment technologies provides opportunities to improve the use of plant nutrients in manures, because of the release of manure products with different N/P ratios. Applying acidification technology and optimized combination of NH 3 emission mitigation measures increase the N recovery from animal manure, and can decrease the demand of mineral fertilizers. However, some technologies decrease the N and P recovery and/or decrease the availability of the N and P in manure products to plants. Implementation of manure treatment in practice is forced by the pressure from EU environmental regulations, and is hindered by financial barriers. To encourage the adoption of manure treatment, policies must be economically appealing to attract new adopters (farmers and industries). Long-term financial support schemes (e. g. subsidies) seem to be necessary, especially with the current low prices for fossil fuels. Outreach strategies are required to convey the knowledge to stakeholders from both the supply and the demand side, with respect to the economic, technical and environmental aspects of manure treatment technologies...|$|E

Using flow cytometry, gene expression profiling, and Ig VH-D-JH sequencing, we monitor the initial 10 generations of development of sorted cord blood CD 34 highLineage− pluripotential progenitors growing in bone marrow S 17 stroma cocultures. We show that (i) multipotent progenitors (CD 34 +CD 45 RA+CD 10 −CD 19 −) directly generate an initial wave of Pax 5 +TdT− “unilineage” pre/pro-B cells and a later wave of “multilineage” CLP/early-B cells and (ii) the cells generated in these successive stages act as precursors for distinct pro-B cells through two independent layered pathways.

40|$|Antibody {{diversity}} {{is created by}} imprecise joining of the variability (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) gene segments of the heavy and light chain loci. Analysis of rearrangements is complicated by somatic hypermutations and uncertainty concerning the sources of gene segments and the precise {{way in which they}} recombine. It has been suggested that D genes with irregular recombination signal sequences (DIR) and chromosome 15 open reading frames (OR 15) can replace conventional D genes, that two D genes or inverted D genes may be used and that the repertoire can be further diversified by heavy chain V gene (VH) replacement. Safe conclusions require large, well-defined sequence samples and algorithms minimizing stochastic assignment of segments. Two computer programs were developed for analysis of heavy <b>chain</b> <b>joints.</b> JointHMM is a profile hidden Markow model, while JointML is a maximum-likelihood-based method taking the lengths of the joint and the mutational status of the VH gene into account. The programs were applied to a set of 6329 clonally unrelated rearrangements. A conventional D gene was found in 80 % of unmutated sequences and 64 % of mutated sequences, while D-gene assignment was kept below 5 % in artificial (randomly permutated) rearrangements. No evidence for the use of DIR, OR 15, multiple D genes or VH replacements was found, while inverted D genes were used in less than 1 ‰ of the sequences.
