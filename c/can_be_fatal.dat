5|$|The poppy and opium are mentioned; Pliny {{notes that}} opium induces sleep and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fatal.</b> Diseases and their {{treatment}} {{are covered in}} book XXVI.|$|E
5|$|The {{sting of}} jack jumper ants <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fatal,</b> and an {{antivenom}} {{has been developed}} for it.|$|E
5|$|Chloroacetone turns brown-orange {{when exposed}} to light, while ethyl bromoacetate is a yellow liquid at {{tropical}} outdoor temperatures. Both have similar colors to the liquid used on the demonstrators. Some varieties of French tear gas contained phosgene oxime or hydrogen cyanide. These two chemicals <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fatal,</b> {{but none of the}} protestors in this incident died.|$|E
50|$|This {{syndrome}} <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>fatal.</b> In some cases, it {{has been}} known to cause permanent renal failure.|$|R
25|$|With proper treatment, {{people usually}} recover {{in two to}} three weeks. The {{condition}} <b>can,</b> however, <b>be</b> <b>fatal</b> within hours.|$|R
25|$|Incorrect {{application}} (e.g. {{into the}} lungs) results in pulmonary aspiration, which <b>can</b> sometimes <b>be</b> <b>fatal</b> if immediate medical treatment is not initiated.|$|R
5|$|Contaminated {{breathing}} gas {{at depth}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fatal.</b> Concentrations which are acceptable {{at the surface}} ambient pressure will be increased by the pressure of depth and may then exceed acceptable or tolerable limits. Common contaminants are: carbon monoxide - a by-product of combustion, carbon dioxide - a product of metabolism, and oil and lubricants from the compressor.|$|E
5|$|Hypokalemia, a {{deficiency}} of potassium in the plasma, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fatal</b> if severe. Common causes are increased gastrintestinal loss (vomiting, diarrhea), and increased renal loss (diuresis). Deficiency symptoms include muscle weakness, paralytic ileus, ECG abnormalities, decreased reflex response; and in severe cases, respiratory paralysis, alkalosis, and cardiac arrhythmia.|$|E
5|$|The {{most serious}} {{potential}} adverse effect of biguanide use is metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA). Though the incidence for MALA about nine per 100,000 person-years, {{this is not}} different from the background incidence of lactic acidosis in the general population. A systematic review concluded no data exists to definitively link metformin to lactic acidosis. Lactic acidosis <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fatal.</b>|$|E

50|$|Police Captain Pronzini {{who often}} takes his pets {{to the office}} only for them to fall prey to his officers' humour, which <b>can</b> {{sometime}} <b>be</b> <b>fatal</b> (and not for the officers).|$|R
50|$|By {{the time}} a {{disorder}} reaches the point of causing dropsy, it <b>can</b> often <b>be</b> <b>fatal</b> {{and at the very}} least the fish is very ill and requires immediate quarantine and treatment.|$|R
5|$|Foreign bodies, {{especially}} {{small pieces}} of hay or straw, can become lodged {{in the eyes of}} guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and in some cases an opaque film over the eye due to corneal ulcer. Hay or straw dust can also cause sneezing. While it is normal for guinea pigs to sneeze periodically, frequent sneezing may be a symptom of pneumonia, especially in response to atmospheric changes. Pneumonia may also be accompanied by torticollis and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fatal.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the US Mint began minting pennies {{coated in}} copper but {{containing}} primarily zinc. The new zinc pennies pose {{a risk of}} zinc toxicosis, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fatal.</b> One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal sepsis. Another patient who ingested 12grams of zinc showed only lethargy and ataxia (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements). Several other cases have been reported of humans suffering zinc intoxication by the ingestion of zinc coins.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the tight}} control of enzyme {{activity}} {{is essential for}} homeostasis, any malfunction (mutation, overproduction, underproduction or deletion) of a single critical enzyme {{can lead to a}} genetic disease. The malfunction of just one type of enzyme out of the thousands of types present in the human body <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fatal.</b> An example of a fatal genetic disease due to enzyme insufficiency is Tay-Sachs disease, in which patients lack the enzyme hexosaminidase.|$|E
50|$|Wild boar {{roam the}} {{mountain}} sides, {{but have been}} coming down to the city centers in search of food. These animals are big, strong, and fast and <b>can</b> potentially <b>be</b> <b>fatal</b> to humans.|$|R
25|$|Ingestion of {{kerosene}} <b>is</b> harmful or <b>fatal.</b> Kerosene <b>is</b> sometimes recommended as a folk {{remedy for}} killing head lice, but health agencies warn against this {{as it can}} cause burns and serious illness. A kerosene shampoo <b>can</b> even <b>be</b> <b>fatal</b> if fumes <b>are</b> inhaled.|$|R
50|$|Incorrect {{application}} (e.g. {{into the}} lungs) results in pulmonary aspiration which <b>can</b> sometimes <b>be</b> <b>fatal</b> if immediate medical treatment is not initiated. The use of activated carbon is contraindicated when the ingested substance is an acid, an alkali, or a petroleum product.|$|R
5|$|Spilled hot {{cooking oil}} {{can also cause}} severe third degree burns, In the {{worst-case}} scenario, severe burns <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fatal.</b> The higher temperatures and tendency of oil {{to stick to the}} skin make spilled hot cooking oil far more dangerous than spilled hot water. Children can accidentally place their hands on top of the stove, playing with the materials while being cooked, or accidentally pull the pot down, which can cause significant injury. The utmost care should be used when deep frying when children are present, to protect their safety at all times.|$|E
5|$|The {{clinical}} {{manifestations of}} Chagas disease {{are due to}} cell death in the target tissues that occurs during the infective cycle, by sequentially inducing an inflammatory response, cellular lesions, and fibrosis. For example, intracellular amastigotes destroy the intramural neurons of the autonomic nervous system in the intestine and heart, leading to megaintestine and heart aneurysms, respectively. If left untreated, Chagas disease <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fatal,</b> in most cases due to heart muscle damage.|$|E
5|$|Viral {{epidemiology}} is {{the branch}} of medical science that deals with the transmission and control of virus infections in humans. Transmission of viruses can be vertical, which means from mother to child, or horizontal, which means from person to person. Examples of vertical transmission include hepatitis B virus and HIV, where the baby is born already infected with the virus. Another, more rare, example is the varicella zoster virus, which, although causing relatively mild infections in humans, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fatal</b> to the foetus and newborn baby.|$|E
50|$|After ingestion, {{the powder}} {{combines}} with gastric juices to develop cathartic intestinal gases which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> somewhat helpful in evacuating the users's bowels. However their use {{can also lead}} to unpleasant side effects, and <b>can</b> even <b>be</b> <b>fatal</b> in subjects with conditions such as hernia, bowel obstruction or other ailments.|$|R
50|$|A type of enzyme {{deficiency}} (enzyme G6PD) {{found most}} frequently in those of African descent can develop into severe anemia and requires monitoring. Children {{are more sensitive}} to hydroxychloroquine: small doses <b>can</b> <b>be</b> potentially <b>fatal.</b>|$|R
50|$|Discontinuing {{consumption}} of alcohol {{after several years of}} heavy drinking <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>fatal.</b> Alcohol withdrawal <b>can</b> cause anxiety, autonomic dysfunction, seizures, and hallucinations. Delirium tremens is a condition that requires people with a long history of heavy drinking to undertake an alcohol detoxification regimen.|$|R
5|$|A.phalloides {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{poisonous}} of all known toadstools. It is estimated that as little as half a mushroom contains enough toxin to kill an adult human. It has been involved in the majority of human deaths from mushroom poisoning, possibly including the deaths of Roman Emperor Claudius in AD 54 and Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740. It has been the subject of much research, and many of its biologically active agents have been isolated. The principal toxic constituent is Î±-amanitin, which damages the liver and kidneys, causing hepatic and renal failure that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fatal.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{with similar}} {{substances}} with a sedative-hypnotic mechanism, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, withdrawal from alcohol dependence <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fatal</b> {{if it is}} not properly managed. Alcohol's primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the GABAA receptor, promoting central nervous system depression. With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in tolerance and physical dependence. When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person's nervous system suffers from uncontrolled synapse firing. This can result in symptoms that include anxiety, life-threatening seizures, delirium tremens, hallucinations, shakes and possible heart failure. Other neurotransmitter systems are also involved, especially dopamine, NMDA and glutamate.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is {{detectable}} with {{measuring devices}} in concentrations {{as low as}} 0.2 parts per million (ppm), and by smell at 3 ppm. Coughing and vomiting may occur at 30 ppm and lung damage at 60ppm. About 1000ppm <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fatal</b> after a few deep breaths of the gas. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) concentration is 10 ppm. Breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system and exposure to the gas can irritate the eyes. The toxicity of chlorine comes from its oxidizing power. When chlorine is inhaled at concentrations greater than 30ppm, it reacts with water and cellular fluid, producing hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hypochlorous acid (HClO).|$|E
50|$|Typical {{envenomation}} {{symptoms include}} local swelling, petechiae, bruising and blistering {{of the affected}} limb, spontaneous systemic bleeding of the gums and into the skin, subconjunctival hemorrhage and incoagulable blood. The systemic symptoms <b>can</b> potentially <b>be</b> <b>fatal</b> and may involve hemostatic disorders, intracranial hemorrhage, shock and renal failure.|$|R
50|$|Earth's {{atmosphere}} and magnetosphere allow adequate protection at ground level, but astronauts {{are subject to}} potentially lethal doses of radiation. The penetration of high-energy particles into living cells can cause chromosome damage, cancer and other health problems. Large doses <b>can</b> <b>be</b> immediately <b>fatal.</b>|$|R
40|$|Cockroach antigens (proteins {{found in}} the insects' feces, saliva, eggs, and shed cuticles) have been implicated {{as one of the}} leading causes of asthma among inner-city children. These antigens can trigger severe {{allergic}} reactions, and even tiny amounts <b>can</b> <b>be</b> potentially <b>fatal</b> to sensitive asthmatics...|$|R
5|$|Fairley {{travelled}} to New Guinea {{at the end}} of June 1943 {{and arranged}} for Plasmodium falciparum cases to be evacuated to Cairns for treatment. As the flight time from Port Moresby to Cairns was only a few hours, this was considered safe, but since the disease <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fatal</b> if not treated promptly, Fairley was concerned lest the cases be delayed for some reason. Movement Control suggested that a special priority be allocated to such cases, and Major General Frank Berryman suggested calling it priority Neil after Fairley himself. Because movement priorities had to have five letters, an extra L was added on the end. Priority Neill soon came to be applied to the entire Cairns project.|$|E
5|$|Good {{conformation}} in {{the limbs}} leads to improved movement and decreased likelihood of injuries. Large differences in bone structure and size {{can be found}} in horses used for different activities, but correct conformation remains relatively similar across the spectrum. Structural defects, as well as other problems such as injuries and infections, can cause lameness, or movement at an abnormal gait. Injuries to and problems with horse legs can be relatively minor, such as stocking up, which causes swelling without lameness, or quite serious. Even non-fatal leg injuries <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fatal</b> to horses, as their bodies are designed to bear weight on all four legs and serious problems can result if this is not possible.|$|E
5|$|Ingestion of {{metallic}} lead, such {{as small}} lead fishing lures, increases blood lead levels and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>fatal.</b> Ingestion of lead-contaminated food {{is also a}} threat. Ceramic glaze often contains lead, and dishes that have been improperly fired can leach the metal into food, potentially causing severe poisoning. In some places, the solder in cans used for food contains lead. When manufacturing medical instruments and hardware, solder containing lead may be present. People who eat animals hunted with lead bullets {{may be at risk}} for lead exposure. Bullets lodged in the body rarely cause significant levels of lead, but bullets lodged in the joints are the exception, as they deteriorate and release lead into the body over time.|$|E
50|$|Beaver attacks <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>fatal</b> for {{domestic}} animals. A dog died during surgery after being {{bitten by a}} beaver in 2010 at University Lake in Alaska, where a number of unprovoked attacks against pets were recorded. A husky {{was killed by a}} beaver attack in Alberta, which has also had several non-fatal attacks.|$|R
50|$|European {{brown hare}} {{syndrome}} (EBHS) {{is a disease}} caused by a calicivirus similar to that causing rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHS) and <b>can</b> similarly <b>be</b> <b>fatal,</b> but cross infection between the two mammal species does not occur. Other threats to the hare are pasteurellosis, yersiniosis (pseudo-tuberculosis), coccidiosis and tularaemia, which are the principal sources of mortality.|$|R
40|$|Hydropneumothorax denotes {{concurrent}} {{presence of}} pneumothorax and hydrothorax in the pleural space, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> a <b>fatal</b> situation.
