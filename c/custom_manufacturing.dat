50|$|The {{products}} and services offered by the fine chemical industry fall into two broad categories: (1) “Exclusives”, a.k.a. <b>custom</b> <b>manufacturing</b> (CM) and (2) “standard” or “catalogue” products. “Exclusives”, provided mostly under contract research or <b>custom</b> <b>manufacturing</b> arrangements, prevail in business with life science companies; “standards” prevail in other target markets. Service-intense <b>custom</b> <b>manufacturing</b> (CM) constitutes the most prominent activity of the fine chemical industry. CM is the antonym of outsourcing. In <b>custom</b> <b>manufacturing,</b> a specialty-chemicals company outsources the process development, pilot plant, and, finally, industrial-scale production of an active ingredient, or a predecessor thereof, to one, or a few, fine chemical companies. The intellectual property of the product, and generally also the manufacturing process, stay with the customer. The customer-supplier relationship is governed by an exclusive supply agreement. At the beginning of cooperation, the customer provides a “tech package,” which in its simplest version, includes a laboratory synthesis description and SHE recommendations. In this case, the whole scale up, which comprises a factor of about one million (10 gram → 10 ton quantities), {{is done by the}} fine chemical company.|$|E

50|$|Fine {{chemical}} / <b>Custom</b> <b>Manufacturing</b> {{companies in}} the narrower sense are active in process scale up, pilot plant (trial) production, industrial-scale exclusive and non-exclusive manufacture and marketing.
