5|$|Karl von Frisch (1886–1982) {{studied the}} European honey bee, demonstrating that bees <b>can</b> <b>recognize</b> a desired compass {{direction}} {{in three different}} ways: by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth’s magnetic field. He showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass; the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark beehive.|$|E
5|$|Days later, Lebowski {{contacts}} the Dude {{stating that}} Bunny has been kidnapped. Lebowski wants the Dude {{to deliver a}} briefcase containing a million-dollar ransom {{and see if he}} <b>can</b> <b>recognize</b> the culprits. Later, a different pair of thugs appear in the Dude's apartment, knock him unconscious, and take Lebowski's rug. When Bunny's kidnappers call to arrange delivery of the ransom, Walter instead gives the kidnappers a fake ransom, namely, a briefcase filled with dirty underwear. The kidnappers grab the fake ransom and leave. Later that night, the Dude's car is stolen, with the real ransom money briefcase still inside.|$|E
5|$|Sheep <b>can</b> <b>recognize</b> {{individual}} human and ovine faces, and remember them for years. In addition to long-term facial recognition of individuals, sheep can also differentiate emotional states through facial characteristics. If worked with patiently, sheep may learn {{their names and}} many sheep are trained to be led by halter for showing and other purposes. Sheep have also responded well to clicker training. Sheep {{have been used as}} pack animals; Tibetan nomads distribute baggage equally throughout a flock as it is herded between living sites.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{complexity}} {{is usually}} {{measured in terms}} of the length of the input string, the unary version of a language can be [...] "easier" [...] than the original language. For example, if a language <b>can</b> be <b>recognized</b> in O(2n) time, its unary version <b>can</b> be <b>recognized</b> in O(n) time, because n has become exponentially larger. More generally, if a language <b>can</b> be <b>recognized</b> in O(f(n)) time and O(g(n)) space, its unary version <b>can</b> be <b>recognized</b> in O(n + f(log n)) time and O(g(log n)) space (we require O(n) time just to read the input string). However, if membership in a language is undecidable, then membership in its unary version is also undecidable.|$|R
50|$|The chest must be {{examined}} by inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation. Subcutaneous emphysema and tracheal deviation must be identified if present. The {{aim is to}} identify and manage six life-threatening thoracic conditions as Airway Obstruction, Tension Pneumothorax, Massive Haemothorax, Open Pneumothorax, Flail chest segment with Pulmonary Contusion and Cardiac Tamponade. Flail chest, tracheal deviation, penetrating injuries and bruising <b>can</b> be <b>recognized</b> by inspection. Subcutaneous emphysema <b>can</b> be <b>recognized</b> by palpation. Tension Pneumothorax and Haemothorax <b>can</b> be <b>recognized</b> by percussion and auscultation.|$|R
5|$|Although {{there are}} many diverse pathogens, {{many of which are}} {{constantly}} mutating, it is a surprise that a majority of individuals remain free of infections. Thus, maintenance of health requires the body to recognize all pathogens (antigens they present or produce) likely to exist. This is achieved by maintaining a pool of immensely large (about 109) clones of B cells, each of which reacts against a specific epitope by recognizing and producing antibodies against it. However, at any given time very few clones actually remain receptive to their specific epitope. Thus, approximately 107 different epitopes can be recognized by all the B cell clones combined. Moreover, in a lifetime, an individual usually requires the generation of antibodies against very few antigens in comparison with the number that the body <b>can</b> <b>recognize</b> and respond against.|$|E
5|$|The School of Music {{presents}} an annual series of concerts that showcase talent {{in a variety}} of genres. School of Music at FIU offers a dynamic learning environment for informed, creative musicians. Students are fully involved in their chosen fields, where they <b>can</b> <b>recognize</b> clearly what they need to learn in order to become contributors to those fields. FIU's School of Music embraces an evolving world for its possibilities and the new opportunities and challenges that it affords, while providing the tools necessary to empower young musicians in their quest to carve out careers. FIU School of Music's concert season incorporates music of all styles including jazz, early music, chamber music, choral/vocal, contemporary music, wind, and opera theater performed by world class musicians and ensembles. Many masterclasses and lectures are also open to the public and offered at no charge. The season runs from August through April each year.|$|E

25|$|A Deterministic finite {{automaton}} (DFA) {{can be seen}} as a special kind of NFA, in which for each state and alphabet, the transition function has exactly one state.
