Its accuracy and effectiveness are demonstrated through a flutter {{analysis of a}} cable-stayed bridge. This framework is utilized to emphasize significance of {{the role played by}} both structural dynamics and aerodynamics on bridge flutter, which helps in better tailoring of the bridge structural systems and deck sections for superior bridge flutter performance. Based on this framework, guidance on the selection of modes and the role of different aerodynamic force components in multimode <b>coupled</b> <b>flutter</b> are offered. The potential importance of the consideration of inter-modal coupling in predicting bridge flutter dominated by the action of torsional mode is highlighted. Finally, a clear insight to the contribution of drag force to bridge flutter is provided...|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{aerodynamic}} {{interaction between}} the heaving vortex-induced vibration and the torsional flutter, another explanation of the drastic change of the vibrational mode from the 5 th symmetrical heaving mode to the 1 st asymmetrical torsional mode is introduced. Some fundamental characteristics of the <b>coupled</b> <b>flutter</b> of a thin plate and a plate like structure, such as the flutter modes, the flutter branches, are explained by use of the “Step-by-Step flutter analysis”. The flutter properties obtained by the 3 DOF multi-modes-flutter analysis are compared with the ones by the 2 DOF 2 modes- flutter analysis t. 3 DOF multi-modes flutter analysis is recommended to use for more accurate verification of the flutter property as the lessons from the aerodynamic behavior of the full-scale elastic model of Akashi Kaikyo Bridge. The reduction of the key equivalent aerodynamic derivatives, by suitable span-wise arrangement of the girders with different girder-shapes, is significantly effective to stabilize the flutter instability of a long spanned suspension bridge. Furthermore, the significantly similar formula with the Selberg formula can be derived under the simple assumptions. As an application of the <b>coupled</b> <b>flutter,</b> the generation mechanism of the propulsion force by use of <b>coupled</b> <b>flutter</b> motion is introduced.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{two possible}} ways of modeling wakes within an unstructured two-field potential flow formulation. It aims at avoiding {{the use of}} specialized mesh generators featuring the a priori imposition of wake cuts. Thus, by making possible the adoption of widely available general-purpose mesh generators, it gives way to an easier application of a potential formulation to complex configurations. A first approach generates a posteriori wake cuts within generic unstructured meshes, while an alternative method translates the potential discontinuity across the wake into a proper weak constraint on the flow velocity within the grid elements intersected, leaving them unchanged.

40|$|General-purpose {{parallel}} processing for solving day-to-day industrial problems {{has been slow}} to develop, partly {{because of the lack of}} suitable hardware from well-established, mainstream computer manufacturers and suitably parallelized application software. The parallelization of a CFD-(computational fluid dynamics) flow solution code is known as ESAUNA. This code is part of SAUNA, a large CFD suite aimed at computing the flow around very complex aircraft configurations including complete aircraft. A novel feature of the SAUNA suite is that it is designed to use either block-structured hexahedral grids, unstructured tetrahedral grids, or a hybrid combination of both grid types. ESAUNA is designed to solve the Euler equations or the Navier-Stokes equations, the latter in conjunction with various turbulence models. Two fundamental parallelization concepts are used—namely, grid partitioning and encapsulation of communications. Grid partitioning is applied to both block-structured grid modules and unstructured grid modules. ESAUNA can also be coupled with other simulation codes for multidisciplinary computations such as flow simulations around an aircraft <b>coupled</b> with <b>flutter</b> prediction for transient flight simulations...|$|R

40|$|Computational {{modelling}} {{of dynamic}} fluid-structure interaction (DFSI) is problematical since conventionally {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) is solved using finite volume (FV) methods and computational structural mechanics (CSM) is based entirely on finite element (FE) methods.

40|$|A MATLAB {{script for}} making {{customized}} {{finite element models}} of suspension bridges is created. The main purpose of the script is to perform eigenvalue analysis of different bridge setups to investigate the controlling parameters for the torsional-to-vertical frequency ratios. The modal output from the model is used to perform aerodynamic stability analysis. The in-wind complex eigenvalue problem (CEV) is solved in an iterative procedure in order to locate the stability limits of the various bridge setups. The bridge geometries investigated originates from a conceptual study on triple-girder flutter-free bridges conducted by Michael Styrk Andersen at The University of Southern Denmark. The FE-model is verified by analysing the Hardanger Bridge. Both the model output and the instability limit, found as 77. 5 m/s, is in good agreement with previous research. The results for other setups gave reasonable natural frequencies and mode shapes, and are verified by simplified calculations made by Michael Styrk Andersen. The widest triple-girder configuration, Setup 3, shows below unity frequency ratios, as expected. The importance of pylon stiffness is investigated, and it is concluded that the natural frequencies are not very sensitive to changes in pylon stiffness. An analysis is made to determine what effect the crossbeam stiffness has on the natural frequencies. For very stiff crossbeams the frequency ratio of Setup 3 was inverted. This allows classical flutter, reducing the stability limit considerably. The available literature has been searched for applicable aerodynamic derivatives for the configurations that are studied. The Messina ADs are implemented for the triple-girder setups. The results are not satisfactory as they are highly unstable regarding the choice of curve fitting. Therefore all setups are analysed using Hardanger and Theodorsen ADs. Michael has planned and performed wind tunnel tests on Setup 1 - 3 parallel with the work on this project. The data is not yet processed as this report is in its finishing stages. It is therefore left for further work to analyse the stability of these setups with the correct ADs. Besides the verification by Hardanger Bridge, there are mainly three different bridge setups analysed. They are all fictitious designs of a suspension bridge crossing Halsafjorden on the Norwegian coastal highway E 39. The bridges has main spans of 2050 meters. Setup 1 is a single hollow-box girder similar to the Hardanger bridge girder. The stability limit is 26. 5 m/s, and denotes the wind velocity at which the bridge deck enters <b>coupled</b> <b>flutter</b> in the first pair of symmetric modes. Setup 2 has a medium wide triple-girder bridge deck. With Hardanger ADs it undergoes classical flutter at 28. 2 m/s, in good correspondence with observed behaviour in wind tunnel testing. The stability limit of Setup 3 is not identified by the complex eigenvalue procedure applied because of the low frequency ratios. The results indicate a critical wind speed of circa 71 m/s for torsional divergence. Unlike the Hardanger analysis, all setups with span-length 2050 meters has considerable lateral deflections in the anti-symmetric torsional modes. This increases {{the effect of the}} lateral ADs on the critical wind speed and frequencies. It is however observed that neglecting these ADs is conservative for all analyses in this report. The in-wind characteristics of suspension bridges with low torsional-to-vertical frequency ratios are investigated. The present results indicates that such bridges has good aerodynamic performance and that flutter instability is avoided. Achieving such low frequency ratios is though compromising for the torsional stiffness of the bridge deck girder, causing fairly low stability limits for static divergence. A CEV analysis of Setup 3 with improved torsional stiffness is conducted, indicating an improvement of the wind velocity at which static divergence occurs. The results indicate a critical wind velocity for static divergence of 91 m/s when increasing the cable distance from 30 to 40 meters. This result verifies indications made in existing research on similar bridges...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{evaluating}} the service life of marine {{structures such as}} risers, one must assess their dynamic response to vortices excitation (vortex-induced vibrations or VIV). At lock-in, i. e. when {{the frequency of the}} shedding of vortices synchronizes with the natural frequency of the structure, the amplitude of vibration of the structure is of the order of its diameter. Sustained vibration of this amplitude causes material fatigue which leads with time to failures. Predicting the flow velocity range for which lock-in occurs is thus of importance. It is also important in cases of flexible structures to predict which mode of vibration will lock-in with the wake. The interest here is in predicting lock-in for rigid and flexible structures like tensioned beams using a linear wake oscillator model: here, lock-in is interpreted as a linear instability caused by the merging of the two natural frequencies of a dynamic system that includes two coupled oscillators, namely the wake and the structure. This instability is also referred as <b>couple</b> mode <b>flutter.</b> It is found that the linear wake oscillator model predicts lock-in range for both elastically supported rigid cylinder and for flexible structures subjected to uniform flows. In particular, the linear approach is able to predict transition from one lock-in mode to another for flexible structures (mode-switching). it is also capable of predicting when more than one mode can lock-in with the wake for a fixed velocity (time sharing) ...|$|R

In this research, a &quot;leaf and stalk&quot; construct was investigated to harvest energy from wind-induced flutter. Fundamental Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) {{studies were carried out}} to experimentally determine the dependence of physical properties of highly compliant cantilever beams on their flutter onset and flutter frequency. The results indicated that the theoretical 2 D scaling laws could be extended to 3 D environment. Also, for the first time, theoretical and experimental analyses were carried out to understand flutter characteristics of slender connected body systems consisting of revolute hinge, when placed at various positions along the beam. The analysis showed that as the hinge position was varied from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the beam, the system transitioned to higher modes of flutter, thereby reducing the amount of harvestable energy. Several leaf-stalk configurations were also experimentally tested to investigate the possibility of {{energy harvesting}} from <b>coupled</b> bending-torsional <b>flutter.</b> High-speed videos were used to identify and differentiate the flutter modes of the configurations to validate the power output results. The results indicated that asymmetrical configurations, when subjected to flutter, are more prone to chaotic flapping and fatigue, thereby reducing the overall power output and effective lifespan of these harvesters. Therefore, two symmetrical-type harvesters were placed in stream-wise, cross-stream and vertical directions to identify the proximity effects of these harvesters on their power output. It was found that when two harvesters were placed in stream-wise direction, at a particular separation distance, the downstream harvester provided 20 - 40 % high power compared to the upstream harvester. The overall purpose of this work was to develop a scalable energy harvesting system for urban sustainability, mainly to power ULP devices like sensors and LED lights...|$|R

Although this model problem of fluid-structure interaction {{has been studied}} continuously since the pioneering work of Lord Rayleigh in 1879, the existing theoretical models are unable to predict accurately the instability threshold. Indeed the experiments show {{that the system is}} much more stable than the actual predictions (Kornecki et al. 1976; Watanabe et al. 2002). In the present study, we re-examine this problem by taking into account the three-dimensionality of the flow. For a rectangular plate of finite aspect ratio, we have developed a linear model of 2 D <b>fluttering</b> <b>coupled</b> to a 3 D flow. The aspect ratio is defined as H/L, where H is the plate span and L its length. The flow is examined in the Fourier space, both in the span- and streamwise direction.

At first order, we recover the results of existing theories for plates of infinite span (Guo & Paidoussis 2000).

40|$|Offshore {{wind energy}} {{has been growing}} rapidly due to its {{capacity}} for utilizing much larger turbines and thus higher power generation compared to onshore. With the increasing size of offshore wind turbine rotors, the design criteria used for the blades may also evolve. Increased flexibility in blades causes {{them to be more}} susceptible to experiencing flow-induced instability. One of the destructive aero-elastic instabilities that can occur in flexible structures subjected to aerodynamic loading is coupled-mode flutter. Coupled-mode flutter instability has not been a design driver in the current wind turbine blades, however, considering the industry tendency in utilizing longer and lighter blades, it needs very closeattention. Long-span bridges, aircrafts and turbomachines are the most common engineering devices subject to flutter. In recent years, a few studies have focused on flutter instability in wind turbine blades. Coupled-mode flutter in wind turbine blades {{is the result of the}} interaction between a torsional mode and a flapwise mode. The two structural modes coalesce at a critical flow velocity and result in a negative damping that cannot be compensated by structural damping. Contrary to the stall flutter which is the result of separation and reattachment of the flow due to high angles of attack, classical flutter occurs in the attached flow regime and may occur in pitch-regulated wind turbines. The aim of this thesis is to provide a thorough study of the coupled-mode flutter in wind turbine blades. For this purpose coupled-mode flutter is studied both through theoretical modeling and wind tunnel experimentations. Parametric studies are performed on three MW-size wind turbine blades and it is shown that the ratio between the torsional and flapwise natural frequencies, as well as the magnitude of the 1 st torsional natural frequency significantly influence the onset of flutter. To investigate the influence of uncertainty in system’s parameters on the onset of flutter, Monte Carlo simulations are conducted assuming randomness in both flow forces and structural properties. It is shown that the safety margin between the flutter onset and the rated rotor speed shrinks and in some cases vanishes when the randomness is considered. Different reliability methods are used to mitigate the Monte Carlo simulations and a new reliability method which is developed, is proven to be a viable substitute for the Monte Carlo with much less computing time. <b>Coupled</b> mode <b>flutter</b> of fixed and rotating highly flexible airfoils is also studied and the influence of static deflection on the flutter characteristic is shown and validated through conducting experiments in a wind tunnel.

Em algumas ocasiÃµes as fÃªmeas nÃ£o aceitaram os machos para a cÃ³pula, indicando que os estes provavelmente nÃ£o estavam aptos a se reproduzirem, ou a prÃ³pria fÃªmea nÃ£o estava apta a se reproduzir, havendo nesse momento reconhecimento quÃ­mico entre os adultos para a formaÃ§Ã£o do casal. Os adultos revoaram em campo em maiores quantidades das 20 : 00 h as 23 : 00 h. Mating Behavior in Cyclocephala verticalis Burmeister (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) Abstract. The genus Cyclocephala has a {{large number}} of species distributed in various regions of Brazil, however, there are few studies related to mating behavior of this group, so this paper was to study the behavior of copulation Cyclocephala verticalis Burmeister. With a light trap installed next to the pasture area, being performed collections of adults from August to September 2013. In laboratory males and females were kept in separate containers and at dusk, couples have been formed to observations of steps involving the behavior of copula. From October 28 to November 4 of 2013, to determine the time of fly, was collected the insects on the light trap, every 60 minutes, starting the studies the 18 : 00 pm and closing remarks at 6 : 00 am, from the following day. Upon leaving the soil adults actively performed the flight then landed, and the male to find the female, approaches and touches it with the first pair of legs and antennae. If the female accepts the male, to copulate occurs which lasted 12. 5 + 1. 3 min on average, and occurred between 19 : 00 pm and 02 : 00 am. Sometimes the females did not accept males for copulation, indicating that these probably were not able to reproduce, or female herself was not able to reproduce, with that time chemical recognition among adults for the formation of the <b>couple.</b> Adults <b>fluttered</b> on the pitch in larger quantities 20 : 00 pm to 23 : 00 pm...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDrawing {{profit from}} ambient {{geophysical}} flows to create electrical power received a growing attention recently in particular for small-power or low-velocity applications where {{the use of}} traditional wind-turbine technologies is made prohibitive or inefficient by either the size, the cost or remoteness of the equipment considered. For those applications, fluid-solid instabilities generating spontaneous and self-sustained periodic oscillations of a solid body are promising energy harvesting mechanisms, provided one is able to convert into usable form the solid kinetic or elastic energy. We investigate here the energy harvesting potential of a plate in an axial flow equipped with a distributed series of small piezoelectric elements, as sketched on Figure 1 a. It is now well known that a plate in axial flow displays large amplitude oscillations once a critical value of the flow velocity is reached, a phenomenon {{commonly referred to as}} “flag flutter” [1]. Each of the piezoelectric pairs is connected to an energy harvesting circuit, as sketched in Figure 1 b. In the this modelling, the power dissipated in the resistance represents the power effectively harvested by the system. This harvested power acts like a damping on the mechanical system and thus can affect the critical flutter velocity and the dynamics of the plate. We are then faced to a strongly coupled fluid-solid-electrical system. In a recent work [2], considering the continuous limit where the length of the piezos is small compared to the typical wavelengths of deformation, we showed that this system is effectively able to produce electrical energy and found the conditions for maximizing the energy harvesting efficiency. We now address the consequences on the dynamics of the use of inductive electrical elements, and the effect of using non-infinitesimal length piezoelectric patches. [1] Kornecki, A. and Dowell, E.

40|$|The {{failure of}} wing panels {{on a number}} of TBF- 1 and TBM- 1 {{airplanes}} in flight has prompted several investigations of the possible causes of failure. This report describes tests in the Langley 16 -foot high-speed tunnel to determine whether these failures could be attributed to changes in the aerodynamic characteristics of the ailerons at high speeds. The tests were made of a 12 -foot-span section including the tip and aileron of the right wing of a TBF- 1 airplane. Hinge moments, control-link stresses due to aerodynamic buffeting, and fabric-deflection photographs were obtained at true airspeeds ranging from 110 to 365 miles per hour. The aileron hinge-moment coefficients were found to vary only slightly with airspeed in spite of the large fabric deflections that developed as the speed was increased. An analysis of these results indicated that the resultant hinge moment of the ailerons as installed in the airplane would tend to restore the ailerons to their neutral position for all the high-speed flight conditions covered in the tests. Serious aerodynamic buffeting occurred at up aileron angles of - 10 degrees or greater because of stalling of the sharp projecting lip of the Frise aileron. The peak stresses set up in the aileron control linkages in the buffeting condition were as high as three times the mean stress. During the hinge-moment investigation, flutter of the test installation occurred at airspeeds of about 150 miles per hour. This flutter condition was investigated in some detail and slow-motion pictures were made of the motion of the wing tip and aileron. The flutter was found to involve simultaneous normal bending and chordwise oscillation of the wing and flapping of the aileron. The aileron motion appeared to be <b>coupled</b> with this <b>flutter</b> condition and was investigated in some detail and slow-motion pictures were made of the motion of the wing tip and aileron. The flutter was found to involve simultaneous normal bending and chordwise oscillation of the wing and flapping of the aileron. The aileron motion appeared to be coupled with the motion of the wing through the mass unbalance of the aileron in the normal-to-chord plane due to location of the hinge line 2. 17 inches below the center of gravity of the aileron. Flutter did not occur when the installation was stiffened to prevent chordwise motion or when the bending frequency of the aileron system was appreciably higher than that of the wing as in the complete airplane installation...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} work presents series of {{investigations into the}} structural dynamics and dynamic aeroelastic (flutter) behaviour of composite and metal wings. The study begins with a literature review where the development and an over view of the previous investigations in this field are presented. Static stiffness {{is very important to}} any type of analysis, especially in both dynamic and flutter analysis as in this case. Therefore, different methods are presented and used for the determination of cross- sectional rigidities such as bending, torsional and bending-torsional coupling rigidities properties for beams constructed of laminated and thin-walled structures materials. A free vibration experimental analysis was conducted on the physical Cranfield Al aerobatic composite wing box structure. The composite wing box was exited in the frequency range of 0 to 300 Hz, with both sinusoidal and random excitations, which yields to six resonant frequencies. The theoretical free vibration and flutter analysis was then carried out firstly on the physical Cranfield Al aerobatic metal wing box. The metal wing was modeled using two techniques; the first model was a simplified wing structure (beam with lumped mass). This analysis of the simplified model was done using CALFUN program for the free vibration analysis and using MSC/NASTRAN for both free vibration and flutter analysis. The second model was a detailed model created by MSC/PATRAN and analyzed by MSC/NASTRAN for the free vibration and flutter analysis. The obtained results (natural frequencies and mode shapes) showed a good agreement between the simplified, detailed model and the experimental test. It was found that even with using the simplified model, but having the physical characteristics of the wing leads to a good agreement with the detailed model and experimental work. This also showed the importance of simplified model at early stage of the design to the structural designer in terms of the accuracy, time, and size of the model. Free vibration and flutter analysis was carried out on the Cranfield Al aerobatic composite wing box with the original laminate lay ups using Lanczos method for extracting the eigenvalues and eigenvectors and using PK method for finding the flutter speed and frequency provided by MSC/NASTRAN. The results were compared with the experimental vibration analysis and were found a large difference in the first frequency mode. To investigate the cause of the variation, a series of static loading tests were performed on the composite wing box. Also a comparison of the results between the metal and composite aerobatic wing box is presented. It was found that the large difference could be due to the combination of different parameters such as stiffness (age of the wing, delamination and boundary condition), and increase of mass of the physical wing box (due to environmental effect such as moisture) and modelling differences. The free vibration characteristics of ten wing models constructed from balanced and unbalanced laminate configurations were carried out using Lanczos method provided by MSC/NASTRAN. The analysis was done on ten wing models modeled to simulate Circumferentially Asymmetric Stiffness (CAS) and Circumferentially Uniform Stiffness (CUS). The static equivalent stiffness was calculated using two different modeling methods {{for a wide range of}} fibre angles 0 (- 90 ° to 90 °) of the skins. The variations and the importance of the stiffness ratio (EI/GJ), parameter (K/GJ), and the frequency ratio (wb/(Ot) are illustrated against the fibre angle 0. It was found that the fundamental bending frequency is slightly lower in the case of CUS (K = 0) as compared to the CAS (K # 0), which was not the case in the plate model. Also, the first torsion frequency mode in the case of CUS was much lower than the first torsion frequency of the CAS, which was not the case of the plate model. However, the effect of bend-twist coupling stiffness on the mode shapes was pronounced in both structures especially at the area of higher <b>coupling</b> stiffness. The <b>flutter</b> analysis was done using the PK method for all the wing models of both (CAS) and (CUS) configurations. The results showed the optimum value of flutter speed and the importance of the stiffness ratio (EI/GJ), parameter (K/GJ), the frequency ratio (wb/wt), which will lead to the maximum flutter speed. The effects of the above parameters, geometrical coupling and the wash-in and washout on the non- dimensional flutter speed are presented. It was concluded that, negative bend-twist coupling stiffness is beneficial for flutter speed compared to the positive bend-twist coupling stiffness at 00 < 0 <_ 30 °. It was also found that the flutter speed for the CUS was higher at 00 < 0 <_ 300 compared to the CAS. Also creating an offsite between the elastic axis and center of gravity (behind) decreases the flutter speed whereas having more ribs increases the flutter speed compared with adding stringers. The analysis was carried out on a more practical composite wing box, which was the physical Cranfield Al aerobatic composite wing box. There are some simplifications on the physical structure, which are the cancellation of the woven materials and keeping the same laminate lay ups for the upper and lower skin. The natural frequency and mode shapes was obtained and plotted against the fibre angle 0 of the upper and lower skin for the (CAS) and (CUS) configurations using both symmetric and asymmetric laminate for the upper and lower skin. The flutter analysis was done for the composite wing box for the same configurations as in the free vibration analysis. The effects of the fibre angle 0 of the upper and lower skin, material coupling stiffness, wash-in and wash-out, and structural damping on the non- dimensional flutter speed and flutter frequencies are illustrated. It was found that in this configurations both structural and bend-twist coupling are exist, negative bend- twist coupling (wash-in) increases the flutter speed compared with the positive bend- twist coupling, and the possibility of increasing the flutter speed at higher frequency ratio, structural coupling and positive bend-twist coupling (wash-out) ...|$|R
