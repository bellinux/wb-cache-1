50|$|RNA {{interference}} is {{a process}} where the breakdown of RNA molecules into miRNA inhibits gene expression of specific host mRNA sequences. miRNA is produced within the <b>cell</b> <b>starting</b> from primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) in the nucleus. These long sequences are cleaved into smaller precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which are usually 70 nucleotides with a hairpin structure. Pri-miRNA are identified by DGCR8 and cleaved by Drosha to form the pre-miRNA, a process that occurs in the nucleus. These pre-miRNA are then exported to the cytoplasm, where they are cleaved by Dicer to form mature miRNA.|$|E
50|$|Herman is a lovable, good-natured, clumsy, buffoon. Despite {{having been}} alive for centuries, he behaves rather childishly, often {{throwing}} temper tantrums, punctuated with thundering animal-like roaring. Despite his childish behaviors he is a caring father figure {{to his son}} Eddie and a loving, devoted husband. He is very kind to everyone, {{but he is also}} very naive, often misunderstanding situations or falling for various schemes. He occasionally has problems recognizing when someone has malicious or dishonest intentions towards him. Most people, however, flee in terror on seeing Herman's monstrous visage, which he always attributes to something else. In some instances, his presence has caused inanimate objects or artwork to come to life and flee in terror: such as a statue of Daniel Boone in a park, a stuffed gorilla in a museum, and a graffiti drawing of a face in a jail <b>cell</b> <b>starting</b> out smiling and the facial expression changes to terror.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} {{scientists}} to theorize the existence of spontaneous cascades of electrical activity during retinal development was, computational neurobiologist David J. Willshaw. He proposed that adjacent cells generate electrical activity in a wave-like formation through layers of interconnected pre-synaptic and postsynaptic cells. Activity propagating through a close span of pre- and postsynaptic cells is thought to result in strong electrical activity in comparison to pre- and postsynaptic cells that are farther apart, which results in weaker activity. Willshaw thought this difference in firing strength and location of cells was responsible for determining the activities boundaries. The lateral movement of firing from neighboring cell to neighboring <b>cell,</b> <b>starting</b> in one random area of cells and moving throughout both the pre- and postsynaptic layers, {{is thought to be}} responsible for the formation of the retinotopic map. To simulate the cascade of electrical activity, Willshaw wrote a computer program to demonstrate the movement of electrical activity between pre- and postsynaptic cell layers. What Willshaw called spontaneous patterned electrical activity is today referred to as retinal waves.|$|E

50|$|This {{algorithm}} is a randomized {{version of the}} depth-first search algorithm. Frequently implemented with a stack, this approach {{is one of the}} simplest ways to generate a maze using a computer. Consider the space for a maze being a large grid of cells (like a large chess board), each <b>cell</b> <b>starting</b> with four walls. Starting from a random cell, the computer then selects a random neighbouring cell that has not yet been visited. The computer removes the wall between the two cells and marks the new cell as visited, and adds it to the stack to facilitate backtracking. The computer continues this process, with a cell that has no unvisited neighbours being considered a dead-end. When at a dead-end it backtracks through the path until it reaches a cell with an unvisited neighbour, continuing the path generation by visiting this new, unvisited cell (creating a new junction). This process continues until every cell has been visited, causing the computer to backtrack {{all the way back to}} the beginning cell. We can be sure every cell is visited.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} variant of the Calculus of Looping Sequences (CLS for short) with global and local rewrite rules. While global rules, as in CLS, are applied {{anywhere}} in a given term, local rules can only be applied in the compartment on which they are defined. Local rules are dynamic: they can be added, moved and erased. We enrich the new calculus with a parallel semantics where a reduction step is lead by any number of global and local rules that could be performed in parallel. A type system is developed to enforce the property that a compartment must contain only local rules with specific features. As a running example we model some interactions happening in a <b>cell</b> <b>starting</b> from its nucleus and moving towards its mitochondria. ...|$|E

Any definition of strain used in the viscoelastic model leads to a particular characterization of the evolution laws of active deformations showing that zero dimensional models cannot be directly translated in a three dimensional framework...|$|E

40|$|Cell {{enrichment}} {{is currently}} in high demand in medical engineering. We have reported that non-blood cells can attach to a blood-compatible poly(2 -methoxyethyl acrylate) (PMEA) substrate through integrin-dependent and integrin-independent mechanisms because the PMEA substrate suppresses protein adsorption. Therefore, we assumed that PMEA analogous polymers can change the contribution of integrin to cell attachment through the regulation of protein adsorption. In the present study, we investigated protein adsorption, cell attachment profiles, and attachment mechanisms on PMEA analogous polymer substrates. Additionally, we demonstrated the possibility of attachment-based cell enrichment on PMEA analogous polymer substrates. HT- 1080 and MDA-MB- 231 <b>cells</b> <b>started</b> to attach to poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA) and poly(tetrahydrofurfuryl acrylate) (PTHFA), on which proteins could adsorb well, within 1 h.

Moreover, the ratio of attached cells from a cell mixture can be changed on PMEA analogous polymers.
