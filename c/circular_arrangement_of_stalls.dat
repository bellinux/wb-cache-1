Developed microcolonies consisted <b>of</b> tight <b>circular</b> <b>arrangements</b> <b>of</b> cells with infrequent branching of cells from the main body. In contrast, M 8. 2 cells did not form tetrad patterns and micro‐colonies generally showed enhanced branching and did not develop <b>circular</b> <b>arrangements</b> <b>of</b> cells. On a glass surface under flow conditions, S 141 cells displayed several types of movement behaviours at the surface which may have assisted microcolony formation. M 8. 2 cells appeared unable to develop micro‐colonies, but rather displayed a behaviour which enabled them to spread out across the substratum. Laser scanning confocal microscopy revealed S 141 mature biofilms consisted of characteristic towers of bacterial growth with scattered troughs. The flagellum‐negative M 8. 2 biofilm did not form such architecture, displaying a homogeneous distribution of cells throughout the biofilm and across the entire substratum. Although not required for attachment to the glass substratum, the flagellum was required for alignment as well as specific movement behaviours by S 141 cells. Marina W. Delpin, Alan M.

Features, which uniquely define the plant, can be extracted automatically from images.

Furthermore, in order to achieve fast processing for phenotyping plants, four feature extraction methods are parallelised in order to run on the CPU and GPU.

The experiment featured different spatial configurations of the search space. Results showed that monkeys exhaustively searched 9 containers spatially distributed as a 3 × 3 matrix, a cross, a line, or a circle. Search efficiency was higher when the search space featured either a linear or <b>circular</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> containers. When faced with a linear <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> containers, the subjects developed principled search trajectories from 1 {{end to the other}} of the linear array. This behavioral regulation was independent from search efficiency as measured by the amount of visits to containers already explored. The data suggest that monkeys use either the travel distance or the cognitive costs associated with unprincipled travel trajectories as currency for regulation.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present algorithms, which given a <b>circular</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> n uniquely {{numbered}} processes, determine {{the maximum number}} in a distributive manner. We begin with a simple unidirectional algorithm, in which the number of messages passed is bounded by 2 n log n + 0 (n).

These algorithms disprove Hirschberg and Sinclair's'conjecture that 0 (n²) is a lower bound {{on the number of}} messages passed in undirectional algorithms for this problem. At the end of the paper we indicate how our methods can be used to improve an algorithm due to Peterson, to obtain a unidirectional algorithm using at most 1. 356 n log n + 0 (n) messages.

Its cladding is composed <b>of</b> a <b>circular</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> dielectric tubes {{surrounded by a}} heat-shrink jacket that allows the fiber to be flexible.

Bending loss is also experimentally measured and compared to numerical results. For large bending radii bending loss scales as R− 2 b, whereas for small bending radii additional resonances between core and cladding appear. The transmission window bandwidth is also shown to shrink as the bending radius is reduced. An analytical model is proposed to predict and quantify both of these bending effects...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{category}} of multipass cells is generally {{referred to as}} circular multipass reflection cells. They were first introduced by Thoma and co-workers in 1994. [...] Such cells rely on a <b>circular</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> spherical mirrors. Either, multiple spherical mirrors are positioned on a circle in a concentric arrangement, or only a single, circular mirror is used, where the mirror surface {{is at the same}} time the body of the cell. The beam enters the cell under an angle and propagates on a star-shaped pattern (see picture on the right). The path length in circular multipass cells can be varied by adjusting the incidence angle of the beam. An advantage lies in their robustness towards mechanical stress such as vibrations or temperature changes. Furthermore, circular multipass cells stand out because of the small detection volumes they provide. A drawback of this cell is the inherent concentric mirror arrangement which leads to imperfect imaging after a large number of reflections.|$|R

5000|$|Observations of cowtail {{stingrays}} in Shark Bay, Australia, {{show that}} this species enters shallow, sandy flats during high tide to rest {{for a minimum of}} four hours. They often form small groups when resting, particularly when visibility is poor such as in turbid water or under low light conditions. The typical size of such groups is three individuals (larger groups, up to nine, are rare), arranged in a [...] "rosette" [...] formation with their tails pointing outward. This appears to be an anti-predator behavior, as the close <b>circular</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> the rays allows them to see predators approaching from any direction. The rosette also orients their less critical tails, containing mechanoreceptors that comprise a secondary warning system, towards potential threats. The members of the group will flee in concert, reducing a predator's ability to target any one individual. Cowtail stingrays also preferentially form mixed-species groups with reticulate whiprays (Himantura uarnak), likely because the whiprays are better able to detect predators due to their longer tails.|$|R
40|$|The {{anterior}} end or {{head of a}} devescovinid flagellate from termites continually rotates in a {{clockwise direction}} relative {{to the rest of}} the cell. Previous laser microbeam experiments showed that rotational motility is caused by a noncontractile axostyle complex which runs from the head through the cell body and generates torque along its length. We report here success in obtaining glycerinated cell models of the rotary axostyle which, upon addition of ATP, undergo reactivation and exhibit rotational movements similar to those observed in vivo. Reactivation of rotational motility and flagellar beating of the models requires ATP or ADP and is competitively inhibited by nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs (AMP-PNP and ATP-gamma-S). N-ethylmaleimide, p- hydroxymercuribenzoate, and mersalyl acid also blocked reactivation of both the rotary axostyle and flagella. Vanadate and erythro- 9 -[3 -(2 - hydroxynonyl) ]-adenine (EHNA) selectively inhibited flagellar reactivation without effecting rotational motility. These results, together with previous ultrastructural findings, suggest that the rotary axostyle does not operate by a dynein-based mechanism but may be driven by an actomyosin system with a <b>circular</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> interacting elements...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{some recent}} {{developments}} and new results concerning the trapping of waves by arrays of vertical circular cylinders is presented. In particular, {{the cases are}} examined {{when there is a}} <b>circular</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> cylinders and both finite and infinite periodic linear arrays of identical cylinders. Only for the infinite array is there pure trapping of waves – known as Rayleigh–Bloch or edge waves – which, for particular dominant wavenumbers, reduce to the well-known trapped-mode solutions for a cylinder between two parallel walls having either Neumann or Dirichlet conditions upon them. This latter case is considered separately and some new results are presented. In the circular array and finite linear array the concept of near-trapping is introduced where large resonant motions are found to occur at certain frequencies of the incident wave field. In the case of the finite linear array, these near-trapping frequencies are related to the Rayleigh–Bloch trapped-wave frequencies for the infinite array. Finally, the case when there are two or more lines of cylinders in the linear array is examined...|$|R
