5000|$|Typical electrocoalescers {{are large}} {{settling}} tanks containing electrodes and operates under laminar-flow conditions with bare electrodes {{that may be}} vulnerable to short circuiting. An alternative {{to this type of}} <b>coalescer</b> is a flow through pre-coalescer that is installed upstream in a separator tank. In the Compact Electrostatic <b>Coalescer.</b> [...] droplet coalescence is achieved by applying AC electric fields (50-60 Hz) to water-in-oil emulsions under turbulent-flow conditions. The turbulence increases the collision frequency between the water drops. The electrodes are insulated to prevent short circuiting, and permits water contents of up to 40% as well as water slugs. The equipment is a separate flow-through electrostatic treatment section installed upstream of a gravity separator to improve the performance. By keeping the treatment and settling sections separate, a compact electrostatic <b>coalescer</b> can be obtained that can also be retrofitted.|$|E

50|$|High oil {{compressed}} air coalescing filters remove water and oil aerosols by coalescing the aerosols into droplets. This happens partially because of tortuous path and pressure drop. <b>Coalescers</b> remove both water and oil aerosols {{from the air}} stream, and are rated at particulate contamination through direct interception. Filtration of oil, water aerosols, dust and dirt particles to 0.01 µm the best achievable in industry.|$|R
50|$|Liquid-liquid <b>coalescers</b> {{can also}} be used to {{separate}} hydrocarbons from water phases such as oil removal from produced water. They have been also used in pyrolysis gasoline (benzene) removal from quench water in ethylene plants, although in this application, the constant changing of cartridges can lead to operator exposure to BTX (benzene, toluene and xylene), as well as disposal issues and high operating costs from frequent replacement.|$|R
50|$|In the Oil and Gas, Petrochemical and Oil Refining industries, Liquid-Gas <b>coalescers</b> {{are widely}} used to remove water and {{hydrocarbon}} liquids to <0.011 ppmw (plus particulate matter to <0.3 um in size) from natural gas to ensure natural gas quality and protect downstream equipment such as compressors, gas turbines, amine or glycol absorbers, molecular sieves, PSA's, metering stations, mercury guard beds, gas fired heaters or furnaces, heat exchangers or gas-gas purification membranes.|$|R

50|$|The {{flow diagram}} below depicts the {{equipment}} and the flow paths involved in the process. The LPG (or light naphtha) feedstock enters the prewash vessel and flows upward through a batch of caustic which removes any H2S that may {{be present in the}} feedstock. The <b>coalescer</b> {{at the top of the}} prewash vessel prevents caustic from being entrained and carried out of the vessel.|$|E
5000|$|The {{production}} plant {{is said to}} begin after the production wing valve on the oil well. The product from each well is piped through the choke valve, which regulates the rate of flow. The flowlines are gathered at the inlet manifold and routed into a separator, which will separate the three components. Once the oil has been separated from the gas and produced water, it is usually routed to a <b>coalescer</b> before being metered and pumped to the onshore terminal.|$|E
50|$|Liquid-liquid coalecers {{are also}} {{widely used in}} oil {{refining}} industry to remove the last traces of contaminants like amine or caustic from intermediate products in oil refineries, and also for the last stage dewatering of final products like kerosene (jet fuel), LPG, gasoline and diesel to <15 ppmw free water in the hydrocarbon phase. These <b>coalescers</b> are often electrostatic type, in which a DC electrical field encourages the water droplets to coalesce thus settling by gravity.|$|R

The terminal has since been expanded to include the ACG Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 Oil Trains, BTC's main pumping station and the Shah Deniz gas plant. Facilities at the oil production plant include separators, <b>coalescers,</b> three new crude oil storage tanks, Export Pumps, gas turbine power generators and a central control room.|$|R

50|$|The {{post-treatment}} {{required for}} the overflow stream depends both {{on the nature of}} the inlet stream and what the overflow will be used for. For example, if the fluid being put through the lamella clarifier comes from a heavy industrial plant it may require post-treatment to remove oil and grease especially if the effluent is going to be discharged to the environment. A separation process unit such as a <b>coalescer</b> is often used to physically trigger a separation of the water and the oils.|$|E
50|$|The water {{removed by}} the OWS flows to oil {{collecting}} spaces. There can be two stages. The first-stage filter removes physical impurities present and promotes some fine separation. The second-stage filter uses <b>coalescer</b> inserts {{to achieve the}} final de-oiling. Coalescence is the breakdown of surface tension between oil droplets in an oil/water mixture which causes them to join and increase in size. The oil from the collecting spaces is drained away automatically or manually. In most modern ships, the oil from collecting spaces is drained away automatically.|$|E
5000|$|In the Natural Gas industry, gas/liquid {{coalescers}} {{are used}} for recovery of lube oil downstream of a compressor.

The technical effort is collaboration between Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL), and Argonne National Laboratory. The initial deployment target envisioned for the technology was within the Modular Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction Unit (MCU). Deployment of a new chemical within an existing facility requires verification that the chemical components are compatible with the installed equipment. In the instance of a new organic solvent, the primary focus is on compatibility of the solvent with polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), the polymer used in the <b>coalescers</b> within MCU. This report provides the data from exposing PPS polymer to NGS. The test was conducted over a three month period. PPS is remarkably stable in the presence of the next generation solvent.

50|$|The air is {{then sent}} through a water separator, {{where the air}} is forced to spiral along its length and {{centrifugal}} forces cause the moisture to be flung through a sieve and toward the outer walls where it is channeled toward a drain and sent overboard. Then, the air usually will pass through a water separator <b>coalescer</b> or the sock. The sock retains the dirt and oil from the engine bleed air to keep the cabin air cleaner. This water removal process prevents ice from forming and clogging the system, and keeps the cockpit and cabin from fogging on ground operation and low altitudes.|$|E
50|$|The {{production}} {{of water with}} oil {{continues to be a}} problem for engineers and the oil producers. Since 1865 when water was coproduced with hydrocarbons, it has challenged and frustrated the industry on how to separate the valuable from the disposable. According to Rehm et al (1983), innovation over the years has led from the skim pit to installation of the stock tank, to the gunbarrel, to the freewater knockout, to the hay-packed <b>coalescer</b> and most recently to the Performax Matrix Plate <b>Coalescer,</b> an enhanced gravity settling separator. The history of water treating for the most part has been sketchy and spartan. There is little economic value to the produced water, and it represents an extra cost for the producer to arrange for its disposal. Today oil fields produce greater quantities of water than they produce oil. Along with greater water production are emulsions and dispersions which are more difficult to treat. The separation process becomes interlocked with a myriad of contaminants as the last drop of oil is being recovered from the reservoir. In some instances it is preferable to separate and to remove water from the well fluid before it flows through pressure reductions, such as those caused by chokes and valves. Such water removal may prevent difficulties that could be caused downstream by the water, such as corrosion which can be referred to as being a chemical reactions that occurs whenever a gas or liquid chemically attacks an exposed metallic surface. Corrosion is usually accelerated by warm temperatures and likewise by the presence of acids and salts. Other factors that affect the removal of water from oil include hydrate formation and the formation of tight emulsion that may be difficult to resolve into oil and water. The water can be separated from the oil in a three-phase separator by use of chemicals and gravity separation. If the three-phase separator is not large enough to separatethe water adequately, it can be separated in a free-water knockout vessel installed upstream or downstream of the separators.|$|E
50|$|Agitation, heat, special baffling, {{coalescing}} packs, and {{filtering materials}} {{can assist in}} the removal of nonsolution gas that otherwise may be retained in the oil because of the viscosity and surface tension of the oil. Gas can {{be removed from the}} top of the drum by virtue of being gas. Oil and water are separated by a baffle at the end of the separator, which is set at a height close to the oil-water contact, allowing oil to spill over onto the other side, while trapping water on the near side. The two fluids can then be piped out of the separator from their respective sides of the baffle. The produced water is then either injected back into the oil reservoir, disposed of, or treated. The bulk level (gas-liquid interface) and the oil water interface are determined using instrumentation fixed to the vessel. Valves on the oil and water outlets are controlled to ensure the interfaces are kept at their optimum levels for separation to occur. The separator will only achieve bulk separation. The smaller droplets of water will not settle by gravity and will remain in the oil stream. Normally the oil from the separator is routed to a <b>coalescer</b> to further reduce the water content.|$|E
50|$|Onshore {{terminals}} {{generally have}} fired heaters followed by separators and <b>coalescers</b> to stabilise the crude and remove any produced water not separated offshore. Onshore separators tend {{to operate at}} a lower pressure than the offshore separators and so more gas is evolved. The associated gas is generally compressed, dew-pointed and exported via a dedicated pipeline. If gas export is uneconomical then it may be flared. Onshore terminals frequently have large crude oil storage tanks to allow offshore production to continue if the export route becomes unavailable. Export to the oil refinery is either by pipeline or tanker.|$|R

5|$|During {{trials of}} the first submarines, the {{propulsion}} system {{was found to be}} prone to failure for a variety of reasons. Most failures were attributed to the fifteen-tank diesel fuel system: the tanks were designed to fill with salt water as they were emptied to maintain neutral buoyancy, but water would regularly enter the engines due to a combination of poor design, gravity separation of the fuel and water being insufficient, and operator error resulting from poor training. Problems were also caused by bacterial contamination of the diesel fuel, which, along with the salt water, would cause the fuel pumps to rust and other components to seize. The fuel-related issues were solved by installing <b>coalescers,</b> improving training and operational procedures, and adding biocides to the fuel.|$|R

40|$|During initial non-radioactive {{operations}} at the Modular Caustic Side Solvent Extraction Unit (MCU), the pressure drop across the decontaminated salt solution <b>coalescer</b> reached {approx} 10 psi while processing {approx} 1250 gallons of salt solution, indicating possible fouling or plugging of the <b>coalescer.</b> An analysis of the feed solution and the 'plugged coalescer' concluded that the plugging was due to sodium aluminosilicate solids.

Conclusions from this testing include the following: (1) Testing with the bench-scale <b>coalescer</b> showed an increase in pressure drop from solid particles, but the increase was not as large as observed at MCU. (2) Cleaning the bench-scale <b>coalescer</b> with nitric acid reduced the pressure drop and removed a large amount of solid particles (11 g of bayerite if all aluminum is present in that form or 23 g of sodium aluminosilicate if all silicon is present in that form). (3) Based on analysis of the cleaning solutions from bench-scale test, the 'dirt capacity' of a 40 inch <b>coalescer</b> for the NAS solids tested is calculated as 450 - 950 grams. (4) Cleaning the full-scale <b>coalescer</b> with nitric acid reduced the pressure drop and removed a large amount of solid particles (60 g of aluminum and 5 g of silicon). (5) Piping holdup in the full-scale <b>coalescer</b> system caused the pH to differ from the target value. Comparable hold-up in the facility could lead to less effective cleaning and precipitation of bayerite solid particles.

40|$|Abstract—The <b>coalescer</b> {{process is}} one of the methods for oily water {{treatment}} by increasing the oil droplet size in order to enhance the separating velocity and thus effective separation. However, the presence of surfactants in an oily emulsion can limit the obtained mechanisms due to the small oil size related with stabilized emulsion. In this regard, the purpose of this research is to improve the efficiency of the <b>coalescer</b> process for treating the stabilized emulsion. The effects of bed types, bed height, liquid flow rate and stage <b>coalescer</b> (step-bed) on the treatment efficiencies in term of COD values were studied. Note that the treatment efficiency obtained experimentally was estimated by using the COD values and oil droplet size distribution. The study has shown that the plastic media has more effective to attach with oil particles than the stainless one due to their hydrophobic properties. Furthermore, the suitable bed height (3. 5 cm) and step bed (3. 5 cm with 2 steps) were necessary in order to well obtain the <b>coalescer</b> performance. The application of step bed <b>coalescer</b> process in reactor has provided the higher treatment efficiencies in term of COD removal than those obtained with classical process. The proposed model for predicting the area under curve and thus treatment efficiency, based on the single collector efficiency (ηT) and the attachment efficiency (α), provides relatively a good coincidence between the experimental and predicted values of treatment efficiencies in this study.
