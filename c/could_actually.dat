5|$|Heraldry {{in general}} {{underwent}} {{something of a}} renaissance in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, {{and many of the}} illogicalities of previous centuries were discarded. Crests are now generally not granted unless they <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> be used on a physical helm, and the rules about directions of helms are no longer rigidly observed.|$|E
5|$|Once it was {{determined}} that dry berthing was physically possible for the ship, it was necessary to make a preliminary evaluation of the engineering viable ways in which dry berthing <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> be accomplished. Again, an independent maritime engineering firm was contracted to study the full range of dry berth alternatives and to present a report of their findings to BTF and to TPWD.|$|E
5|$|Parvateshvar – Head of Meluhan Army and a Suryavanshi, Parvateshvar is {{critical}} of Shiva's ways with the Meluhans, and is a dedicated man to Daksha. He eventually becomes an avid follower of Shiva as he realizes that Shiva <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> lead them to victory and finish Lord Ram's Unfinished Task.|$|E

50|$|Broomhill Pool {{opened on}} 30 April 1938 and {{closed in the}} autumn of 2002. The last season when people <b>could</b> {{therefore}} <b>actually</b> swim in the lido was the summer of 2002.|$|R
5|$|Parvateshvar – Head of Meluhan Army and a Suryavanshi, Parvateshvar is {{critical}} of Shiva's ways with the Meluhans, and is loyal to Daksha. He eventually becomes an avid follower of Shiva as he realizes that Shiva <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> lead them to victory and finish Lord Ram's Unfinished Task. He is a good follower of Lord Ram.|$|E
5|$|A major {{difference}} between And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express that Sheldon pointed out {{was that in the}} former, the premise of the novel was that no one solved the murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately {{try to find a way}} to integrate clues into the story so that the player <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> discover the murderer, although the game remained quite uninteractive. In Murder on the Orient Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate clues to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from Murder on the Orient Express, as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|A secret {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} M. W. Kellogg for engineering studies in July 1941. This included the design and construction of a ten-stage pilot gaseous diffusion plant. On 14 December 1942, the Manhattan District contracted Kellogg to design, build and operate a full-scale production plant. Unusually, the contract did not require any guarantees from Kellogg that it <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> accomplish this task. Because {{the scope of the}} project was not well defined, Kellogg and the Manhattan District agreed to defer any financial details to a later, cost-plus contract, which was executed in April 1944. Kellogg was then paid $2.5 million.|$|E
5000|$|John Paul Young was {{the first}} male singer that the show chose to make a megastar. It was an experiment. <b>Could</b> we <b>actually</b> take someone who was {{basically}} unknown and {{in a matter of}} two months turn him into a number one hit? Michael Shrimpton ...|$|R
50|$|Because it was {{difficult}} to see how actual prejudice could occur in the circumstances, and still more difficult to see how it <b>could</b> have <b>actually</b> occurred, the court held that the application should be granted; in other words, that the defect did not invalidate the application.|$|R
60|$|Here was a wonder! Liquor {{could not}} only be smelled, but it <b>could</b> be <b>actually</b> seen! As for Cloud, not {{satisfied}} with gratifying the two senses connected with the discoveries named, he began to lap with his tongue, like a dog, to try the effect of taste.|$|R
5|$|In 1897, the French Academy of Sciences made {{understanding}} bicycle dynamics {{the goal}} of its Prix Fourneyron competition. Thus, {{by the end of}} the 19th century, , Emmanuel Carvallo, and Francis Whipple had showed with rigid-body dynamics that some safety bicycles <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> balance themselves if moving at the right speed. Bourlet won the Prix Fourneyron, and Whipple won the Cambridge University Smith Prize. It is not clear to whom should go the credit for tilting the steering axis from the vertical which helps make this possible.|$|E
5|$|In {{pictures}} {{taken by the}} Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, the motion of M87's jet was measured at four to six times the speed of light. This motion is presumably an optical illusion caused by the relativistic velocity of the jet, and not true superluminal motion. However, detection of such motion supports the theory that quasars, BL Lacertae objects and radio galaxies may all be the same phenomenon, known as active galaxies, viewed from different perspectives. It has been proposed M87 <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> be a BL Lacertae object (with a low-luminosity nucleus compared with the brightness of its host galaxy) seen from an unfavorable angle to appreciate the properties {{of that kind of}} galaxy.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that the {{universe}} is well described by four-dimensional spacetime, there are several reasons why physicists consider theories in other dimensions. In some cases, by modeling spacetime in a different number of dimensions, a theory becomes more mathematically tractable, and one can perform calculations and gain general insights more easily. There are also situations where theories in two or three spacetime dimensions are useful for describing phenomena in condensed matter physics. Finally, there exist scenarios in which there <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> be more than four dimensions of spacetime which have nonetheless managed to escape detection.|$|E
50|$|Adair left {{teaching}} {{after she}} married, {{and moved to}} Kingsville, Texas, where she joined a women's group and fought against gambling and for suffrage. She found that she could register to vote, but still <b>could</b> not <b>actually</b> vote, after women's suffrage was officially passed, because of Texas state laws.|$|R
25|$|Stephen Bullock, {{a lawyer}} by profession, who was 150 metres from the shooting, and another {{independent}} witness saw Dan McCann falling backwards {{with his hands}} at shoulder height. At the inquest into the killings Bullock stated, 'I think with one step he <b>could</b> have <b>actually</b> touched the person he was shooting'.|$|R
50|$|However after World War II, the investor’s {{landscape}} dramatically {{changed and}} in a few decades more and more people not only <b>could,</b> but <b>actually</b> had to invest. Those people do have to worry about subsistence and real life-goals! This automatically leads to the notion that investing should start from human needs.|$|R
5|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{questioned}} whether a royal affinity <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> {{work in the same}} way as a noble one. It has been suggested that since the king had to be a lord to his retainers and provide good lordship, but also king to the entire people, a contradiction existed, resulting in a decline in local stability where this occurred. At the same time, even powerful magnates such as Gaunt could cause local dissatisfaction by retaining some and, inevitably, excluding others. On the other hand, it has also been pointed out how, particularly for kings, recruitment into the affinity was a clear promotion which could act as an encouraging loyalty or offered a political amnesty.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of Pan-Asianism, met Japanese premier Count Terauchi and Count Okuma, a former premier, in an attempt to enlist support for the Ghadarite movement. Tarak Nath Das urged Japan to align with Germany, on the grounds that American war preparation <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> be directed against Japan. Later in 1915, Abani Mukherji— a Jugantar activist and associate of Rash Behari Bose— is also known to have tried unsuccessfully to arrange for arms from Japan.|$|E
5|$|If {{the office}} of {{governor}} becomes vacant through death, resignation, or conviction on impeachment, the lieutenant governor becomes governor {{for the remainder of}} the term; if the office is only temporarily vacant due to disability of the governor, the lieutenant governor only acts out the duties of governor. Should both offices be vacant, the president pro tempore of the state senate becomes governor. The position of lieutenant governor was created in the 1874 constitution; prior to then, the speaker of the senate would act as governor in cases of vacancy. Originally, the lieutenant governor could only act as governor; it was not until the 1968 constitution that the lieutenant governor <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> become governor in that fashion. The office of governor has been vacant for an extended period once, a 17-day gap in 1848 between the resignation of the previous governor and the swearing in of his acting successor. Governors and lieutenant governors are elected on the same ticket.|$|E

5000|$|Zanuck later {{claimed that}} the casting of Gardner forced the film to be {{postponed}} from September 1956 to February 1957. This meant the film <b>could</b> not <b>actually</b> be shot in Pamplona [...] "unless we wanted to shoot a fiesta in the snow". It was decided to film it in Mexico instead.|$|R
50|$|Louis {{was adopted}} by Charles III and legitimised in his royal title. With this legal basis, he sought {{to take the place}} of his Carolingian {{relatives}} on the imperial and Italian thrones in 900. He was crowned in Pavia and then in Rome, but <b>could</b> not <b>actually</b> hold on to power there.|$|R
5|$|Nosanchuk then {{considered}} {{whether or}} not to call Lamb to the stand on his own behalf at the trial. He already had a strong defence, with five psychiatrists firmly behind him as well as George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary, who had agreed to testify on his behalf. The lawyer considered the boy's probable reaction to a cross-examination by the prosecution in court. Lamb appeared calm and collected on the surface, and had so far answered questions about right and wrong in a somewhat rational way. Although the doctors had been able to see Lamb's answers for what they really were, Nosanchuk feared that Lamb's appearance <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> lead the jury to believe that he was sane, which might lead to a guilty verdict and the gallows. He therefore did not call Lamb to the stand.|$|E
5|$|Poehler became {{pregnant}} {{during the latter}} half of the season, with her baby due in the summer or early fall of 2010. The Parks and Recreation producers decided not to write the pregnancy into the show, so they decided to enter into a continuous production after the season ended to bank episodes for the third season. Six season three episodes were filmed in this fashion. However, in May 2010, NBC announced the third season of Parks and Recreation was being moved to an undisclosed midseason premiere date to allow the network's new comedy, Outsourced, to run in the Thursday two-hour comedy schedule block. NBC chief executive officer Jeff Gaspin said this move was not a reflection on Parks and Recreation, and suggested the extended hiatus would not only have no effect on the show's momentum, but <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> build anticipation for its eventual return. In November 2010, it was announced Parks and Recreation would return to a 9:30p.m. Thursday timeslot effective January 20, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Taoism was the {{official}} {{religion of the}} Tang. Buddhism, originating in India {{around the time of}} Confucius, continued its influence during the Tang period and was accepted by some members of imperial family, becoming thoroughly sinicized and a permanent part of Chinese traditional culture. In an age before Neo-Confucianism and figures such as Zhu Xi (1130–1200), Buddhism had begun to flourish in China during the Northern and Southern dynasties, and became the dominant ideology during the prosperous Tang. Buddhist monasteries played an integral role in Chinese society, offering lodging for travelers in remote areas, schools for children throughout the country, and a place for urban literati to stage social events and gatherings such as going-away parties. Buddhist monasteries were also engaged in the economy, since their land property and serfs gave them enough revenues to set up mills, oil presses, and other enterprises. Although the monasteries retained 'serfs', these monastery dependents <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> own property and employ others to help them in their work, including their own slaves.|$|E
50|$|In 1978 Mattel {{released}} a toy Viper which could launch missiles. On December 31 of that year, a four-year-old boy suffocated and died after {{he shot a}} missile into his throat. This led to a recall of these Viper toys. Subsequent versions possessed missiles that actuated when a button was pressed but <b>could</b> not <b>actually</b> leave the toy.|$|R
50|$|The {{first public}} release of {{aptitude}} was version 0.0.1 on November 18, 1999. It was very limited: {{it had the}} ability to view the list of available packages, but <b>could</b> not <b>actually</b> download or install any packages. By version 0.0.4a, this ability had been added, with many other improvements; this version was included in Debian 2.2, code name: potato.|$|R
60|$|M r Micawber {{returned}} to the King's Bench when his case was over, as some fees were to be settled, and some formalities observed, before he <b>could</b> be <b>actually</b> released. The club received him with transport, and held an harmonic meeting that evening in his honour; while Mrs. Micawber and I had a lamb's fry in private, surrounded by the sleeping family.|$|R
5|$|The Corporal had {{numerous}} limitations. It {{took a long}} time to set up, so it could not engage targets of opportunity; there could be delays in the countdown process, which made it hard to warn the troops to close their eyes or aircraft to avoid the area; and it was guided by a radio beam that not only could be jammed, but <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> be diverted. Moreover, during test firings in the Outer Hebrides, although eight out of twelve missiles accurately hit their targets, four fell short, which is always regrettable but particularly so when nuclear weapons are involved in view of the danger it posed to one's own troops. A new British project was therefore launched to develop a better missile, codenamed Blue Water, which was to have used the British Indigo Hammer and later the Tony warhead.|$|E
5|$|The Progress Party has {{historically}} sometimes been portrayed externally as a populist or right-wing populist party (or other similar terms), both by opposing politicians, {{as well as}} some scholars. Depending on definitions of populism, other scholars have however found that populism is at best a minor element of the party, or that its policies historically have been more consistent than for instance those of the Labour Party, which has moved more towards the Progress Party and neoliberalism since the 1980s. Political scientist Anders Todal Jensen has argued that the Progress Party is the only populist party in Norway, with all the other parties in contrast having strong elitist foundations. He has suggested that populism <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> be a sign of health as the structures of the traditional parties make them poorly able to “listen to the people” in the same manner that the Progress Party may.|$|E
5|$|The {{shoulder}} of Acrocanthosaurus was {{limited in its}} range of motion {{compared to that of}} humans. The arm could not swing in a complete circle, but could retract (swing backwards) 109° from the vertical, so that the humerus <b>could</b> <b>actually</b> be angled slightly upwards. Protraction (swinging forward) was limited to only 24° past the vertical. The arm was unable to reach a vertical position when adducting (swinging downwards), but could abduct (swing upwards) to 9° above horizontal. Movement at the elbow was also limited compared to humans, with a total range of motion of only 57°. The arm could not completely extend (straighten), nor could it flex (bend) very far, with the humerus unable even to form a right angle with the forearm. The radius and ulna (forearm bones) locked together so that there was no possibility of pronation or supination (twisting) as in human forearms.|$|E
40|$|In this year's State of the Union Address, President Obama {{announced}} a National Export Initiative to double American exports {{over the next}} five years. He claimed that this could add two million jobs to the American economy. <b>Could</b> Tennessee <b>actually</b> double its exports over this period? And what would be the impact if it did?Tennessee, exports, trade, imports, exporting, global commerce, international...|$|R
25|$|The railway {{lines the}} KCRC {{operated}} were less profitable than the MTRC, and the KCRC was less active in property development. It was widely considered that the Government's choice was {{to avoid being}} criticised for selling assets of the KCRC, which it wholly owned to MTRCL at an underpriced level. Leasing the operation right of the KCR system to the MTRCL <b>could</b> avoid <b>actually</b> selling the KCRC.|$|R
25|$|Interestingly, {{none of the}} {{numerous}} relief fragments shows king Khufu offering to a god. This is remarkable, since reliefs of Sneferu and those of all kings from Menkaura onward show the king offering to a deity. It {{is possible that the}} lack of this special depicting program influenced later ancient Greek historians in their assumptions that Khufu <b>could</b> have <b>actually</b> closed all temples and prohibited any sacrifice.|$|R
