5|$|The 1936 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season officially began on June12, 1936, and lasted until December6, 1936. These dates <b>conventionally</b> delimit {{the period of}} each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin.|$|E
5|$|A {{transmission}} line {{is required to}} bring the generated power to (often remote) markets. For an off-shore station this may require a submarine cable. Construction of a new high-voltage line may be too costly for the wind resource alone, but wind sites may take advantage of lines installed for <b>conventionally</b> fueled generation.|$|E
5|$|According to the Government of Canada, the Government of Quebec, the Commission de toponymie du Québec, and the Geographical Names Board of Canada, {{the names}} of Canadian cities and towns have only one {{official}} form. Thus, Montréal is officially spelled with an accented é in both Canadian English and French. However, Canadian English spelling <b>conventionally</b> omits the accent in both Montreal and Quebec.|$|E
5|$|Directions Techniques Des Constructions Naval of France {{originally}} supplied {{a design}} modified from the Agosta class, but the submission review board did not view this favourably, as the submarine {{was of the}} same vintage as the Oberons. Their submission was altered to a <b>conventionally</b> powered version of the Rubis-class nuclear submarine.|$|E
5|$|Each {{hemisphere}} is <b>conventionally</b> {{divided into}} four lobes; the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe, named according to the skull bones that overlie them. Each lobe is associated {{with one or two}} specialised functions though there is some functional overlap between them.|$|E
5|$|For other {{problems}} {{so long as}} power is available for the braking and steering system, the vehicle can be <b>conventionally</b> towed subject to instructions in the owner's manual. Using the car to tow trailers is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{texts are}} <b>conventionally</b> known {{by a single}} {{uppercase}} letter and a name, such as Tablet C, the Mamari Tablet. The somewhat variable names may be descriptive or indicate where the object is kept, as in the Oar, the Snuffbox, the Small Santiago Tablet, and the Santiago Staff.|$|E
5|$|Parathyroid {{disease is}} <b>conventionally</b> divided into {{states where the}} {{parathyroid}} is overactive (hyperparathyroidism), and states where the parathyroid is under- or hypoactive (hypoparathyroidism). Both states are characterised by their symptoms, which relate to the excess or deficiency of parathyroid hormone in the blood.|$|E
5|$|Releases of <b>conventionally</b> reared {{hatchery}} steelhead pose ecological {{risks to}} wild steelhead populations. Hatchery steelhead are typically {{larger than the}} wild forms and can displace wild-form juveniles from optimal habitats. Dominance of hatchery steelhead for optimal microhabitats within streams may reduce wild steelhead survival {{as a result of}} reduced foraging opportunity and increased rates of predation.|$|E
5|$|Some {{computers}} {{play better}} overall if their memory is devoted {{instead to the}} ordinary search and evaluation function. Modern engines analyze far enough ahead <b>conventionally</b> to handle the elementary endgames without needing tablebases (i.e. without suffering from the horizon effect). It is only in more complicated endgames that tablebases will have any significant effect on an engine's performance.|$|E
5|$|The 1939 Pacific typhoon {{season has}} no {{official}} bounds; it ran year-round in 1939, but most tropical cyclones tend {{to form in}} the northwestern Pacific Ocean between May and November. These dates <b>conventionally</b> delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The 1975 Pacific {{hurricane}} season officially started May 15, 1975, {{in the eastern}} Pacific, and June 1, 1975, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1975. These dates <b>conventionally</b> delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeast Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The 1980 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was tied with}} 1932, 1969, and 1994 for most named storms in Atlantic Ocean {{during the month of}} November– only to be surpassed in 2001 and 2005. The season officially began on June1, 1980, and lasted until November30, 1980. These dates <b>conventionally</b> delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The 1990 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the most}} active Atlantic {{hurricane season}} since 1969. It officially began on June 1, 1990, and lasted until November 30, 1990. These dates <b>conventionally</b> delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. One tropical depression did form before the season officially started, however.|$|E
5|$|The 2002 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was an average Atlantic {{hurricane season}} in which twelve named storms formed. Although Tropical Storm Arthur formed on July14, the season officially began on June1 and ended on November30, dates that <b>conventionally</b> delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic basin. The season's final storm, Tropical Depression Fourteen, dissipated on October16.|$|E
5|$|The 2005 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season officially began June 1, 2005 and officially ended on November 30, 2005. These dates <b>conventionally</b> delimit {{the period of}} each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin, although effectively the season persisted into January 2006 due to continued storm activity.|$|E
5|$|The 2013 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was a below-average season, featuring the fewest number of hurricanes since 1982. Although Tropical Storm Andrea formed on June5, the season officially began on June1 and ended on November30, dates that <b>conventionally</b> delimit {{the period of}} each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic basin. The season's final storm, an unnamed subtropical storm, dissipated on December7.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine Empire or Byzantium {{is a term}} <b>conventionally</b> used {{by historians}} to {{describe}} the Greek ethnic and speaking Roman Empire of the Middle Ages, centered on its capital of Constantinople. Having survived {{the fall of the}} Western Roman Empire during Late Antiquity, the Byzantine Empire continued to function until its conquest by the Ottoman Turks in 1453.|$|E
5|$|The {{emperors}} of the Han dynasty {{were the}} supreme heads of government {{during the second}} imperial dynasty of China; the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) followed the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) and preceded the Three Kingdoms (220–265 AD). The era is <b>conventionally</b> divided between the Western Han (202 BC – 9 AD) and Eastern Han (25–220 AD) periods.|$|E
5|$|The season officially {{started on}} May 15, 1991, {{in the eastern}} Pacific, and on June 1, 1991, in the central Pacific. It lasted until November 30, 1991, in both basins. These dates <b>conventionally</b> delimit the period of each year when most {{tropical}} cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds are diurnal: they feed, breed {{and defend}} territories during the day. Many {{of the family}} are, however, {{reluctant}} to enter areas of direct sunlight where it breaks through the forest canopy. Antbirds will engage in anting, a behaviour in which ants (or other arthropods) are rubbed on the feathers before being discarded or eaten. While this has <b>conventionally</b> been considered a way to remove and control feather parasites, {{it has been suggested}} that for antbirds it may simply be a way to deal with the distasteful substances in prey items.|$|E
5|$|British {{political}} institutions include the Westminster system, the Commonwealth of Nations and Privy Council of the United Kingdom. Although the Privy Council {{is primarily a}} British institution, officials from other Commonwealth realms are also appointed to the body. The most notable continuing instance is the Prime Minister of New Zealand, its senior politicians, Chief Justice and Court of Appeal judges are <b>conventionally</b> made Privy Counsellors, as the prime ministers and chief justices of Canada and Australia used to be. Prime Ministers of Commonwealth countries which retain the British monarch as their sovereign continue to be sworn as Privy Counsellors.|$|E
5|$|D mode {{is present}} in all graphite-like carbons and {{originates}} from structural defects. Therefore, {{the ratio of the}} G/D modes is <b>conventionally</b> used to quantify the structural quality of carbon nanotubes. High-quality nanotubes have this ratio significantly higher than 100. At a lower functionalisation of the nanotube, the G/D ratio remains almost unchanged. This ratio gives an idea of the functionalisation of a nanotube.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, the initial impact {{of rock and}} roll on {{mainstream}} American culture waned as major record companies took a controlling influence and sought to market more <b>conventionally</b> acceptable recordings. Electric musical instruments (particularly guitars) and amplification were becoming more affordable, allowing young musicians to form small groups to perform in front of local audiences of their peers; and in some areas there was a breakdown, especially among radio audiences, of traditional black and white markets, with more white teenagers listening to and purchasing R records.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} when exactly Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet. Juliet's nurse {{refers to an}} {{earthquake}} she says occurred 11 years ago. This may refer to the Dover Straits earthquake of 1580, which would date that particular line to 1591. Other earthquakes—both in England and in Verona—have been proposed {{in support of the}} different dates. But the play's stylistic similarities with A Midsummer Night's Dream and other plays <b>conventionally</b> dated around 1594–95, place its composition sometime between 1591 and 1595. One conjecture is that Shakespeare may have begun a draft in 1591, which he completed in 1595.|$|E
5|$|On 7 July 1961, {{the second}} prototype, XP836, {{performed}} its first take off <b>conventionally.</b> Continuing {{tests of the}} two prototypes proceeded {{to close the gap}} between vertical take off and flight, a feat which was achieved on 8 September 1961. During September, the feat was repeated multiple times by both prototypes, transitioning from vertical to horizontal flight and vice versa, including instances in which the auto-stabiliser was intentionally disabled.|$|E
5|$|President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama {{attended}} 10 official inaugural balls {{during the}} evening of January 20, 2009. Barack Obama wore a new tuxedo made by Hart Schaffner Marx, a Chicago-based menswear company. He also wore a white bow tie, instead of the conventional black. Traditionalists considered this a fashion faux pas, as a white tie is <b>conventionally</b> only worn with a white waistcoat and tails. Michelle Obama wore a white, one-shouldered, sleeveless gown designed by 26-year-old NewYork-based designer JasonWu, breaking with the recent practice set by former first ladies Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton, who showcased designers from their hometowns.|$|E
5|$|The 1953 Pacific {{hurricane}} season {{was the least}} active season on record. The season officially began on May 15 in the northeast Pacific Ocean and on June 1 in the central northern Pacific. They ended on November 30. These dates <b>conventionally</b> delimit {{the time of year}} when most tropical cyclones form in northeast Pacific Ocean. Before the satellite age started in the 1960s, data prior to that time on Pacific hurricanes is extremely unreliable as most east Pacific storms are of no threat to land.|$|E
5|$|The 1957 Pacific {{hurricane}} season was a moderately active {{year in which}} 13 tropical cyclones formed. The {{hurricane season}} ran through {{the summer and fall}} months which <b>conventionally</b> delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The first tropical cyclone developed on July 15. The final storm dissipated on December 6, becoming one of the few Pacific storms to exist outside of the seasonal dates. Of the season's 13 storms, five of these formed or crossed into the central Pacific.|$|E
5|$|The 1962 Pacific {{hurricane}} season was a moderately active Pacific {{hurricane season}} that included two hurricane landfalls. The 1962 Pacific hurricane season officially started on May15, 1962 {{in the eastern}} Pacific and June1, 1962 in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility and lasted until November30, 1962 in both regions. These dates <b>conventionally</b> delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The 1972 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{is one of}} five Atlantic {{hurricane season}}s not to have any major hurricanes, the others being 1968, 1986, 1994, and 2013. Although Subtropical Storm Alpha formed on May23, the season officially began on June1 and ended on November30, dates that <b>conventionally</b> delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic basin. The season's final storm, Subtropical Storm Delta, dissipated on November7.|$|E
5|$|The 1983 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the least}} active Atlantic {{hurricane season}} in 53years, during which only four tropical storms formed. The season officially began on June 1, 1983, and lasted until November 30, 1983. These dates <b>conventionally</b> delimit the period of each year when most storms form in the Atlantic basin. The season had very little activity, with only seven tropical depressions, four of which reached tropical storm strength or higher. This led to the lowest Accumulated Cyclone Energy count since 1950, but not since 1900.|$|E
5|$|The 1984 Pacific typhoon {{season has}} no {{official}} bounds, but most tropical cyclones tend {{to form in}} the northwestern Pacific Ocean between May and November. These dates <b>conventionally</b> delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. Tropical Storms formed in the entire west pacific basin were assigned a name by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA. This can often result in the same storm having two names.|$|E
5|$|The 1987 Pacific {{hurricane}} season {{was the last}} {{year in which the}} Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center was the primary warning center for tropical cyclones in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The season officially started May 15, 1987, in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1987, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1987. These dates <b>conventionally</b> delimit the period of each year when the vast majority of tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The 1988 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was a moderately active season that proved costly and deadly, with 15tropical cyclones directly affecting land. The season officially began on June 1,1988, and lasted until November 30,1988, although activity began on May 30 when a tropical depression {{developed in the}} Caribbean Sea. The June through November dates <b>conventionally</b> delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The first cyclone to attain tropical storm status was Alberto on August 8, nearly a month later than usual. The final storm of the year, Tropical Storm Keith, became extratropical on November 24.|$|E
