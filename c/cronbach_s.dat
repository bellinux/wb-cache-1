40|$|ABSTRACT: For the {{management}} of a condition such as asthma, patients should feel confident with their medication, feel that the treatment is adequate in controlling symptoms and that side-effects of the treatment are minimal. As no comprehensive instrument to measure patient satisfaction with inhaled asthma medication existed, the Satisfaction with Asthma Treatment Questionnaire was developed. The procedures that were used are described, and the initial validation and reliability tests are reported. The study involved focus group meetings, development, testing and modification of a preliminary instrument, and testing of the revised instrument using different samples of patients with asthma. Factor analysis of the 26 -item questionnaire identified four domains reflecting four aspects of satisfaction: effectiveness of treatment, ease of use, medication burden, and side-effects and worries. <b>Cronbach</b> 9 <b>s</b> alpha showed evidence of internal consistency reliability. Test/retest reliability ranged from 0. 66 – 0. 74. Interscale correlations were moderate-to-high. Significant correlations were found between domain and overall scale scores and patients 9 overall level of satisfaction. The Satisfaction with Asthma Treatment Questionnaire is potentially a useful instrument for gaining insight into patient satisfaction with inhaled treatment for asthma...|$|R
40|$|A {{revision}} of the Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C 30) of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) was undertaken to improve low internal consistency estimates (Cronbach's alpha) and content validity for the role functioning scale and a conceptual difficulty (undue emphasis on physical functioning) in the global quality of life (QOL) scale. The role functioning items were reworded and a four-category response format was substituted for the previous dichotomous format. A new item asking about 'overall health' was substituted for the 'overall physical condition' item in the global QOL domain. The original and new versions were tested at three time points {{in a total of}} 1, 181 patients with cancer in Canada (n = 696) and the Netherlands (n = 485). In both samples there was a marked improvement in internal consistency for the role functioning scale (<b>Cronbach's</b> alpha <b>s</b> ranging from 0. 78 - 0. 88) in the new version. In the global QOL scale, the substitution of the new item for the previous one did not alter internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha's ranging from 0. 81 - 0. 92).

40|$|Background: Psychosocial {{factors such}} as stress, depression, {{feelings}} of hopelessness, and hostility {{are known to be}} associated with physical health. Similar associations have been believed to be true for stress and periodontal diseases as well. Objectives: The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the relationships between perceived stress and periodontal disease in samples of US and Syrian adults and to assess whether coping behaviors modify this relationship. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 321 patients between 35 - 75 years of age in the dental clinics at the University of Michigan-School of Dentistry in Ann Arbor, MI., USA, and 311 patients (between 30 - 70 years of age) in the dental clinics at the University of Damascus, Syria. The subjects completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Brief Cope Scale. Periodontitis was assessed using clinical attachment level (CAL). Total PSS and Brief Cope were included in a logistic model to evaluate their relationship with periodontitis. Age, gender, smoking, and diabetes were used in regression models to control for confounding effects. Results: The reliability coefficients and internal consistencies for all the subscales of the Brief Cope were moderate, with <b>Cronbach</b> <b>s</b> alpha ranging from 0. 67 to 0. 89 for the US sample and from 0. 50 to 0. 94 for the Syrian sample. <b>Cronbach</b> <b>s</b> alpha for the PSS was 0. 86 and 0. 76 for the US and Syrian samples respectively. Logistic regression analyses indicated that perceived stress was significantly associated with greater attachment levels for the Syrian and US samples (odds ratio, OR = 1. 05; 95 % CI = 1. 01 to 1. 09; OR = 1. 06; 95 % CI = 1. 01 to 1. 11, respectively) after adjusting for age, gender, diabetes, and cigarette smoking. Using stress as a categorical variable, only those respondents who used cognitive coping style were found to have greater odds of periodontitis when exposed to stress (OR = 5. 34; p < 0. 05, and OR = 10. 84; p < 0. 01 for the Syrian and US samples respectively).

Three commonly applied methods are a visual analog scale(VAS), the standard gamble(SG), and the time trade-off(TTO). We studied participants subjective experience using computer implementations these methods using scale we call the VIBE (for Value Instrument Battery [...] Evaluation) that measures four aspects of user acceptance (clarity, difficulty, reasonableness, and comfort level) Studies were performed in two groups: patients with HIV infection (n= 75) and {{a convenience sample of}} the general public(n= 640). In the patient study, VIBE scores appeared reliable (<b>Cronbach</b> <b>s</b> alpha of 0. 739, 0. 826, and 0. 716, for VAS, SG, and TTO ratings, respectively.) Patients acceptance of the VAS the highest, followed by the TTO and the SG method (p< 0. 05 for all comparisons). Despite significant enhancements in computer software for measuring SG preferences, observed differences in acceptance between SG and VAS methods were replicated in the general public study (p< 0. 0001 for differences).

The two factors explained 50. 04 % of the variance (LV = 20. 24 % and FR = 29. 80 %). Inter-item correlations were all significant and the item-total correlations suggested the weakness of one item in the LV scale. <b>Cronbach</b> <b>s</b> alpha was 0. 72 (LV) and 0. 79 (FR). Confirmatory factor analysis however provided marginal support for the posited structure. Vigorous types were significantly more alert than languid types across the day and suggested they are less influenced by sleep inertia on waking. Vigorous types also reported needing significantly less sleep. Significant differences in alertness between flexible and rigid types were found between 16 : 00 and 22 : 00 and suggested flexible types are less influenced by circadian and wakefulness factors during these periods. Flexible types also reported significantly less sleep need compared to rigid types. The findings suggested vigorous and flexible types would best cope with shiftwork. It is concluded that the CTI demonstrated good reliability and validity in a working sample. Recommendations for future studies are made...|$|E
40|$|Research is burgeoned {{with the}} {{association}} between adolescent mental health and family cohesion and connectedness (White, Shelton &, Elgar, 2013; Jose, Ryan &, Pryor, 2012; Jaggers, Church, Tomek, Hooper, Bolland &, Bolland, 2014) where the family {{can be seen as}} a moderating risk factor that can enhance resilience (Maynard &, Harding, 2010; Fergus &, Zimmerman, 2005). In the present study I explored the relationship between family commitment and adolescent well-being with the main research question, What is the relationship between family commitment and adolescent well-being? In order to answer this question, I formulated a secondary question namely; Does commitment and well-being vary as a result of sex, parents marital status and participants relationship with their parents? For the present study, I adopted a quantitative methodological approach to secondary data analysis, as numerical data and statistical analyses were used to explore the relationship between the variables. The sample was conveniently sampled and consisted of adolescents in a high school setting between the ages of 16 and 18 years. Data was collected via the administration of a questionnaire which comprised of the Family Commitment Scale (FCS) and the Trait Well-being Inventory (TWBI). The reliability analyses confirmed that both the FCS (? =. 930) and the TWBI (? =. 878) have moderate to high <b>Cronbach</b> alpha <b>s</b> and are therefore reliable measures. Non-parametric statistical analyses were conducted to answer the primary research question, through the two stated hypotheses. The results proved that both null hypotheses could be rejected in favour of the alternative, thus indicating that there is a significant relationship between family commitment and well-being and that participants perceptions of their relationship with their parents significantly impacts their perceptions of their family commitment and overall well-being. The findings of the present study contribute to the utility of the Family Commitment Scale in measuring family commitment and add to the literature on adolescent well-being and commitment to family-of-origin.

40|$|Aims and objectives. To {{examine the}} psychometric {{properties}} of the Nurses' Observation Scale for Cognitive Abilities. Background. Nurses' Observation Scale for Cognitive Abilities is a behavioural rating scale comprising eight subscales that represent different cognitive domains. It is based on observations during contact between nurse and patient. Design. Observational study. Methods. A total of 50 patients from two geriatric wards in acute care hospitals participated in this study. Reliability was examined via internal consistency and inter-rater reliability. Construct validity of the Nurses' Observation Scale for Cognitive Abilities and its subscales were explored by means of convergent and divergent validity and post hoc analyses for group differences. Results. <b>Cronbach's</b> alpha <b>s</b> of the total Nurses' Observation Scale for Cognitive Abilities and its subscales were 0. 98 and 0. 66 - 0. 93, respectively. The item-total correlations were satisfactory (overall > 0. 4). The intra-class coefficients were good (37 of 39 items > 0. 4). The convergent validity of the Nurses' Observation Scale for Cognitive Abilities against cognitive ratings (MMSE, NOSGER) and severity of dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating) demonstrated satisfactory correlations (0. 59 - 0. 70, p 0. 05). The divergent validity of the Nurses' Observation Scale for Cognitive Abilities against depressive symptoms was low (0. 12, p > 0. 05). The construct validity of the Nurses' Observation Scale for Cognitive Abilities subscales against 13 specific neuropsychological tests showed correlations varying from poor to fair (0. 18 - 0. 74; 10 of 13 correlations p < 0. 05). Conclusions. Validity and reliability of the total Nurses' Observation Scale for Cognitive Abilities are excellent. The correlations between the Nurses' Observation Scale for Cognitive Abilities subscales and standard neuropsychological tests were moderate. More conclusive results may be found if the Nurses' Observation Scale for Cognitive Abilities subscales were to be validated using more ecologically valid tests and in a patient population with less cognitive impairment. Relevance to clinical practice. Use of the Nurses' Observation Scale for Cognitive Abilities yields standardised, reliable and valid information about patient's cognitive behaviour in daily practice. The Nurses' Observation Scale for Cognitive Abilities aids in tailoring nursing interventions to patients' specific cognitive needs. We advocate the implementation of the Nurses' Observation Scale for Cognitive Abilities both in research and at geriatric units in acute care hospitals...|$|R

40|$|Two of {{the most}} widely used {{personality}} assessment methods are the Rorschach (Exner, 1993) and the MMPI/MMPI- 2 (Hathaway & McKinley, 1943; 1989). Both methods have demonstrated validity for particular purposes (Meyer & Archer, 2001). However, despite measuring supposedly related constructs, efforts to find a systematic relation between the two types of assessment methods have failed (Archer & Krishnamurty, 1993 a). The aim of the present project was to better understand this lack of systematic inter-method relation. Four hypothesis driven correlation studies were undertaken, based on two samples of 83 and 489 psychiatric patients, respectively, living in Stockholm. All studies included the Rorschach method and one or two self report scales. Inter-method relations were investigated using different self report scales and test variables. The first study replicated the findings of Meyer (1997), demonstrating the effects of first factor related test interaction styles. The second study used a novel form of self report, constructed to achieve maximum conceptual overlap with the suggested meaning of Rorschach Comprehensive System variables. The third study used a different, established self report, the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP) (Horowitz, Rosenberg, Baer, Ureno & Villasenor, 1988), to investigate intermethod relations, measuring interpersonal functioning. The forth study investigated the relation between Rorschach content scales (Urist, 1977; Graves & Thomas, 1981), seizing aspects of the patient s ideation, expressed in verbal responses, and conceptually similar indices in the IIP. In conclusion, the Rorschach Comprehensive System and the self report instruments included in the present thesis do not seem to measure related constructs in heterogeneous samples. Levels of conceptual overlap do not by itself, seem to moderate inter-method relations. It is suggested that the Rorschach and the IIP are systematically related when test variables reflect more similar psychological functioning. In the discussion the method specific nature of individual test scores is noted, with reference to <b>Cronbach</b> and Rajaratnam <b>s</b> concept of generalizability to further understand the results.

40|$|Background: Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is {{a rapidly}} progressive neurodegenerative disease. Executive dysfunction {{is common in}} patients with ALS, with up to 50 % of patients performing within an impaired range. There is evidence that social cognitive deficits associ- ated with ALS are a function of deficits in executive function. The ? Reading the Mind in the Eyes ? Test is a recognized test of social cognitive function, although the reliability of this instru- ment remains to be established. Methodology: Patients with ALS (n = 106), and age and IQ matched controls (n = 50) were recruited and asked to perform the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test {{as part of an}} on-going population-based study of cognitive function. ALS patients were sub-stratified based on the presence, and/or extent of executive dysfunction. Results: <b>Cronbach</b> ? <b>s</b> Alpha of. 73 was observed, indicating good reliability on this measure. Split-half reliability analysis further confirms these findings (p = 0. 826). TheReadingtheMindinthe Eyes test had excellent psychometric properties when discriminating between ALS patients who are cognitively intact, and those who have executive impairment, with an overall medium difficulty. There was a large magnitude significant difference between patients and controls (p < 0. 001; ? 2 =. 19). Post-hoc analysis revealed that controls performed significantly higher than patients with executive impairment (p < 0. 001), and patients with single executive deficits (p = 0. 002). Conclusion: Executive dysfunction impacts on social cognitive performance. This study contributes not only to the psychometric knowledge of this measure, but also to the usability, efficacy, and reliability of social cognitive assessment in ALS.

Porém, não há evidências científicas de que essas doenças neurológicas ocasionam impactos diferentes na qualidade de vida relacionada à saúde (QVRS) de pacientes pediátricos. Este estudo teve o objetivo de identificar os grupos mais vulneráveis com esses diagnósticos, por meio da avaliação e comparação da QVRS de crianças e adolescentes, pela perspectiva dos cuidadores. Participaram do estudo 329 crianças e adolescentes que compuseram os grupos de indivíduos com doença neurológica incapacitante (DNI) (n= 169 [19 com TA, 96 com PC, 30 com MM e 24 com SD]) e o grupo de indivíduos saudáveis (n = 160). Os cuidadores forneceram iinformações demográficas e clínicas e preencheram o questionário genérico de QVRS Child Health Questionnaire - Parent Form 50 (CHQ-PF 50). O coeficiente alfa de Cronbach foi calculado para determinar a confiabilidade do questionário de QVRS. Foram realizadas comparações entre os escores do CHQ-PF 50 obtidos pelas crianças e adolescentes (teste de Kruskal-Wallis) e entre as variáveis demográficas dos participantes e dos cuidadores (teste de Kruskal-Wallis ou Qui-quadrado) entre todos os grupos. A mediana de idade no grupo de pacientes com DNI foi de 8, 0 anos e no grupo de indivíduos saudáveis foi de 10, 0 anos. Não houve diferença significativa entre os grupos quanto ao sexo. O coeficiente alfa de Cronbach variou de - 0, 34 a 0, 97 para o CHQ-PF 50. Todos os pacientes com DNI apresentaram prejuízo no sumário físico e na escala impacto no tempo dos pais em comparação com os indivíduos saudáveis (p 0, 05). Concluindo, a QVRS de pacientes pediátricos é afetada de modo significativamente diferente pelas doenças neurológicas incapacitantes estudadas.

The caregivers supplied demographic and clinical information and completed the generic HRQL questionnaire Child Health Questionnaire - Parent Form 50 (CHQ-PF 50). The <b>Cronbach</b> <b>s</b> alpha coefficient was calculated to determine the reliability of the HRQL questionnaire. Comparisons were made between the scores of the CHQ-PF 50 for children and adolescents (Kruskal-Wallis test) and between the demographic variables of participants and caregivers (Kruskal-Wallis or chi-square test). The median age of the patients with DNI was 8. 0 years and in the healthy group was 10. 0 years. There was no significant difference between the groups regarding sex. The <b>Cronbach</b> <b>s</b> alpha ranged from - 0. 34 to 0. 97 for the CHQ-PF 50.

The analysis was done in two stages; in the first, the evaluation of the SRQ- 20 was carried out by examining the ROC curve, factor analysis of tetracoric correlations, multiple correspondence analysis, the internal consistency was evaluated by the formula of Kuder-Richardson (KD- 20); in the second stage, the JCQ performance was assessed, in which it has been used statistical procedures such as factor analysis with the extraction method of main components and VARIMAX rotation and calculus of <b>Cronbach</b> <b>s</b> Alpha. The results showed satisfactory indicators of performance for both appraised instruments. The SRQ- 20 evaluation revealed the extraction of four factors confirmed by the graphic of the analysis of multiple correspondences, the instrument showed reasonable internal consistency among the scales, the questionnaire performance was satisfactory since it identified symptoms and correctly classified subjects about the suspicion of usual mental disturbs. In general,the JCQ revealed adequacy of its scales to the theoretical model proposed by Karasek, acceptable internal consistency among scales. The good performance of the instruments evaluated in this study showed that these instruments satisfactorily assess what it is intended to be measured and can contribute towards building of indicators of occupational health and efficient policies for the working class...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. While the importance of assessing the occupational consequences of insomnia and other sleep disorders is emphasised in clinical nosologies and research guidelines, there is little consensus on which aspects of occupational performance should be assessed, how such impairment should be measured, and how outcomes should be reported. The research programme described in this thesis aimed to address this issue. Chapter 1 presents a systematic review and methodical critique of studies reporting those aspects of occupational performance most impacted by (or most frequently associated with) insomnia symptoms and degraded sleep quality. Equivocal results, wide variations in reporting conventions, and the overall lack of comparability among studies, strongly indicated {{the need to develop}} a standardised metric able to quantify sleep related occupational performance and serve as an assessment and outcome instrument suitable for use in research and clinical settings. Informed by the literature review, Chapters 2 - 4 describe the development and validation of the Loughborough Occupational Impact of Sleep Scale (LOISS), a unidimensional 19 item questionnaire that captures sleep-related occupational impairment across a number of workplace domains over a 4 -week reference period. Chapters 5 - 7 describe LOISS outcomes from: i) surveys in a random population sample; ii) a representative sample of the UK workforce; and iii) a clinical sample of patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (before and after treatment with CPAP). Overall, the scale showed strong internal consistency (<b>Cronbach</b> <b>s</b> alpha range= 0. 84 - 0. 94) and test-retest reliability (r= 0. 77, r 2 = 0. 59, p< 0. 001), high levels of criterion validity (significantly discriminating between good and poor sleepers), and proved an effective outcome measure in OSA. From the survey data reported in Chapters 2 - 7, LOISS score distributions showed no consistent gender difference but did show a significant ageing gradient, with sleep-related occupational impairment declining with increasing age. In conclusion, the work presented here supports the usability, validity and reliability of the LOISS as an assessment and outcome instrument, and also demonstrates the utility of this instrument in exploring the dynamics of sleep-related occupational performanc...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{validate}} a Stigma Scale of Epilepsy (SSE). METHODS: The SSE {{was completed}} by 40 adult with epilepsy attending an Outpatient Epilepsy Clinic at the University Hospital of UNICAMP, and by 40 people from the community. People were interviewed on an individual basis; a psychologist read the questions to the subjects who wrote the answers in a sheet. The procedure was {{the same for all}} the subjects and completion took around ten minutes. RESULTS: The SSE has 24 items. The internal consistency of the SSE showed alpha <b>Cronbach</b> <b>s</b> coefficient 0. 88 for the patients with epilepsy and 0. 81 for the community. The overall mean scores of the Stigma Scale of Epilepsy formula were: 46 (SD= 18. 22) for patients and 49 (SD= 13. 25) for the community where a score of 0 would suggest no stigma, and 100 maximum stigma. DISCUSSION: The SSE has satisfactory content validity and high internal consistency. It allows the quantification of the perception of stigma by patients and people from community; this can then be used for interventional studies, such as mass media campaign in minimizing the negative facets of stigma. OBJETIVO: Validar a Escala de Estigma na Epilepsia (EEE). MÉTODO: A EEE foi aplicada em 40 pacientes adultos com o diagnóstico de Epilepsia do Ambulatório de Epilepsia do HC/Unicamp e em 40 pessoas da comunidade em geral. Os sujeitos foram entrevistados individualmente pelas psicólogas, que foram lendo as questões e anotando as respostas na escala. As condições de aplicação foram as mesmas e a aplicação durou cerca de 10 minutos. RESULTADOS: A EEE possui 24 itens. A consistência interna da EEE mostrou alfa de Cronbach, de 0, 88 para os pacientes com epilepsia e 0, 81 para a comunidade.

40|$|Background/Purpose. Black {{women have}} lower injury {{prevalence}} after sexual assault and childbirth {{as compared to}} White women. Investigators have also published findings describing similar differences in wound healing and in pressure ulcer formation. Sommers et al. (2008) suggested that differences in injury prevalence may not be related to race or ethnicity, but rather to skin color, and that {{the properties of the}} skin may vary based on skin color. To explicate biomechanical differences that might influence the effects of skin injury versus protection, we chose to investigate the physiological constructs of viscoelasticity and skin color. The study aim was to account for the variability in skin viscoelasticity at four anatomical locations (volar forearm, upper inner arm, inner thigh, and sacrum) as a function of race/ethnicity, skin color, age, body mass index (BMI), recent weight loss, smoking status, sun exposure, and health status in women. ^ Methods. We enrolled 233 healthy adult female participants at a large urban university in this prospective study with a descriptive, cross-sectional design. Study staff collected data regarding health status and demographics via survey. We calculated BMI after obtaining height and weight measurements on-site and measured skin color with a handheld spectrophotometer and skin elasticity with the Cutometer MPA 580. We also developed and used the Sun Exposure Survey Instrument (SESI), which we first evaluated for content validity (S-CVI 0. 944) and internal consistency (<b>Cronbach.</b> <b>s</b> alpha 0. 869, 17 items, N= 63) to measure sun exposure. ^ Results. Significant differences were found in viscoelasticity values across anatomic sites for all participants. The most significant predictor variables of skin viscoelasticity were age, recent weight loss, and BMI. R 2 results ranged from 0. 24 - 0. 41. The significance of the relationships between skin color, sun exposure, and race with viscoelasticity varied across sites. ^ Conclusions and Future Work. The association between aging and decreased skin elasticity is well known, but confirmed herein. The findings on BMI and weight loss are novel and require further investigation. While we explained little of the variance in skin elasticity through the skin color and sun exposure variables, we contend that these relationships should be reassessed with a greater number of participants and a more diverse sample. ...|$|E

40|$|The Good Ending investigates how {{different}} strategies for terminating an innovation project can affect proponents in various ways. Our research separates termination strategies {{in regard to}} how sensitive they are to sustain an individual s face. While a Face-Threatening Termination strategy belittles and disrespects the proponent, a Face-Supportive Termination strategy aims to uphold the proponent s dignity and pride. Our goal was to investigate how these two classifications differed in the effect they had on employees Mood, feeling of Psychological Safety, and Willingness to Innovate in the workplace after facing a project termination. In addition, we researched what role the level of Commitment, Resilience, Rejection Sensitivity, and Threat Sensitivity had {{for the impact of}} Face Messages on Mood, Psychological Safety, and Willingness to Innovate. In collaboration with Professor John Daly and Professor Alf Steinar Saetre, we created a survey and distributed it to students in MSTC, MBA, and EMBA classes at University of Texas at Austin (UT). In total we received 215 valid responses. The data was analyzed using the software package IBM SPSS Statistics (SPSS) and an add-on macro named PROCESS. All data was manually transcribed into an excel-file and thereafter converted to SPSS. To be able to measure the effects of the given factors on an individual s Mood, Psychological Safety, and Willingness to Innovate, all variables were created by combining existing scales and adding relevant items to them. For instance, we applied the established scales by Woltin (2015) and Koopmann, Lanaj, Bono, and Campana (2016), Edmondson (1999), and Scott and Bruce (1994) in order to measure the outcome variables Mood, Psychological Safety, and Willingness to Innovate respectively. The validity of each of the resulting variables were checked by the use of reliability tests and comparing the resulting <b>Cronbach</b> <b>s</b> alpha to Nunnally (1978) s recommendation for a lower limit of 0. 7. Through our research we found that the direct effect of Face Messages on the outcome variables were significant. Face-Threatening Termination was found to have a significantly more negative impact on proponents Mood, Psychological Safety, and Willingness to Innovate than Face-Supportive Termination strategy. It was also found support for the hypothesis that people high in Commitment will experience a more negative Mood following a termination, than people low in Commitment. This was found to applicable to both a Face-Threatening and a Face-Supportive Termination. Additionally, Rejection Sensitivity was found to significantly moderate the impact of Face Messages on Mood and Psychological Safety. It was found that with high Rejection Sensitivity, Mood and Psychological Safety had a much lower score than for individuals with low Rejection Sensitivity. The moderation effect of Rejection Sensitivity was stronger in a Face-Supportive Termination strategy than a Face-Threatening Termination. The other moderating variables were found to be nonsignificant, thus indicating that an idea proponent is in large affected by how the termination is conducted, independently of his or her commitment to the project and individual traits. Through these findings, this thesis emphasizes the importance of being aware of how the termination process impacts employee, and thereby the innovation climate. Having this knowledge is crucial for any successful manager...|$|E

A hip??tese de que a dist??ncia geogr??fica do centro urbano influencia os desfechos de sa??de bucal em popula????es remotas foi testada. M??todos: As comunidades ribeirinhas foram selecionadas com base no crit??rio de localiza????o: uma deveria ser a mais pr??xima da sede do munic??pio (Comunidade de Isidoro) e a outra a mais distante (Comunidade de LauroSodr??). Um estudo de corte {{transversal}} foi conduzido, seguindo os crit??rios da OMS para pesquisas epidemiol??gicas em sa??de bucal. O estudo incluiu indiv??duos de 1 a 75 anos, e os grupos et??rios para an??lise inclu??ram os preconizados pela OMS. Os desfechos cl??nicos foram: c??rie para denti????o dec??dua (ceo-d) e permanente (CPO-D), condi????o periodontal de acordo com os ??ndices CPI, PIP e de sangramento gengival, e les??es de tecido mole.

Adicionalmente, foram aplicados question??rios estruturados a indiv??duos acima de 18 anos, e entrevistas semi-estruturadas a informantes-chave para se obter dados sobre freq????ncia de uso dos servi??os odontol??gicosObjective: The aim of {{this thesis}} was to evaluate oral health conditions and to analyze factors associated with the health-disease process in two rural riverine populations located in the Amazonas state (Brazil). The hypothesis that the geographical distance from urban centers influences oral health outcomes in remote populations, has been tested. Methods: The riverine communities were selected based on the location criteria: one was the nearest from the administrative center of the town (Isidoro Community), {{and the other was}} the farther (Lauro Sodr?? Community). A cross-sectional study was conducted following the WHO guidelines for epidemiological surveys in oral health. The study covered population aged from 1 to 75 years, and the age groups for analysis included the WHO pattern. The clinical outcomes were: dental caries for deciduous (dmf-t) and permanent (DMF-T) teeth, periodontal condition according to the CPI and PIP indexes and to gingival bleeding, and soft tissue lesions. The variables analyzed were: place of residence, socioeconomic data, oral hygiene habits and diet. Additionally, structured questionnaires were applied to individuals above 18 years-old and semi-structured interviews were led with key-informants to obtain data about the frequency of use of dental health services. The OHIP- 14 was validated and applied to individuals above 18 years-old for the description of oral health impacts. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed for the comparison of the two communities. Results: 136 individuals in Isidoro and 242 individuals in Lauro Sodr?? were examined. The farther community (Lauro Sodr??) presented more caries, a higher prevalence of edentate persons, more time in between since their last dental visit, and more negative impacts of oral health than the nearest community. For the DMF-T outcome, when socioeconomic, hygiene and diet variables were controlled in the multivariate analyses, only place of residence and age remained significant. The psychometric properties of the OHIP- 14 was good (ICC= 0, 97 and <b>Cronbach</b> <b>s</b> alpha= 0, 89). Conclusions: The prevalence of untreated caries, oral pain, edentulism and oral health negative impacts were high for the riverines, especially for those who live further distant from the urban center. Additionally, the limited access to dental health services for these populations points to the need for imminent deployment of broad measures of health promotion, along with greater availability of services...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: A {{landmark}} {{report has}} shown that improving glycaemic control among type 1 diabetes patients markedly reduces diabetes-related complications. In clinical practice, however, many patients have problems in adhering to the treatment, and thus remain in poor glycaemic control. Research suggests a more behaviour-oriented approach to diabetes, {{but there is a}} lack of evidence on the efficacy of interventions, especially for those adult type 1 diabetes patients who are in poor glycaemic control. Diabetes-related distress has been associated with poor adherence to treatment and poor glycaemic control. There is a need for validated measures in this area, to identify patients who experience diabetes-related distress. Additionally, injection technique is crucial for the management of diabetes, and lipohypertrophy is a common side effect which deserves further attention. Objectives: The overall aim of this thesis was to evaluate a behavioural medicine intervention among poorly controlled adult type 1 diabetes patients, and to gain a deeper knowledge in an area of diabetes self-management. Methods: Quantitative design was used for the studies, and the clinical settings comprised two diabetes care units in Stockholm, Sweden. Study I: The Swedish version of the Problem Areas in Diabetes (Swe-PAID- 20) scale was evaluated regarding its psychometric properties by type 1 diabetes patients, as well as by an expert panel of diabetes specialist nurses. Study II: A behavioural medicine intervention based on Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) was evaluated in a randomised controlled trial among poorly controlled adult type 1 diabetes patients. Study III: Using the same sample as in study II, descriptive statistics were produced, and predictive and comparative analyses performed, in order to find predictors of or associations with improvements in glycaemic control as a response to the intervention. Study IV: In a randomised crossover trial insulin absorption in lipohypertrophic injection sites was investigated in type 1 diabetes patients. Results and conclusions: Study I: A three-factor solution of the scale was found, comprising sub-dimensions of diabetes-related emotional problems, treatment-related problems and support-related problems. <b>Cronbach</b> <b>s</b> alpha for the total score was 0. 94 and varied between 0. 61 and 0. 94 in the three subscales. The findings also supported the convergent and content validity. The Swe-PAID- 20 seems to be a reliable and valid outcome for measuring diabetes-related distress in type 1 diabetes patients. Study II: Significant differences were observed with respect to HbA 1 c, well-being, diabetes-related distress, frequency of blood glucose testing, fear of hypoglycaemia, perceived stress, and depression, all of which improved more in the intervention group compared with the control group. The CBT based behavioural medicine intervention appears to be a promising approach to diabetes self-management. Study III: The participation rate in the study was 41 % and attrition was 24 %. Of those patients who actually participated in the intervention, 13 % withdrew. From the regression models no predictors or associations were found with regard to improvement in HbA 1 c. The programme proved to be feasible in terms of design and methods. However, no clear pattern was found regarding predictors of or associations with improved metabolic control. Study IV: Impairment of insulin absorption from lipohypertrophic injection sites was also found with analogue insulins. It is suggested that patients should be advised to refrain from injecting insulin aspart into lipohypertrophic subcutaneous tissue...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{response}} {{to the need for}} more comprehensive quality assessment within Australian residential aged care facilities, the Clinical Care Indicator (CCI) Tool was developed to collect outcome data as a means of making inferences about quality. A national trial of its effectiveness and a Brisbane-based trial of its use within the quality improvement context determined the CCI Tool represented a potentially valuable addition to the Australian aged care system. This document describes the next phase in the CCI Tool. s development; the aims of which were to establish validity and reliability of the CCI Tool, and to develop quality indicator thresholds (benchmarks) for use in Australia. The CCI Tool is now known as the ResCareQA (Residential Care Quality Assessment). Methods: The study aims were achieved through a combination of quantitative data analysis, and expert panel consultations using modified Delphi process. The expert panel consisted of experienced aged care clinicians, managers, and academics; they were initially consulted to determine face and content validity of the ResCareQA, and later to develop thresholds of quality. To analyse its psychometric properties, ResCareQA forms were completed for all residents (N= 498) of nine aged care facilities throughout Queensland. Kappa statistics were used to assess inter-rater and test-retest reliability, and <b>Cronbach.</b> <b>s</b> alpha coefficient calculated to determine internal consistency. For concurrent validity, equivalent items on the ResCareQA and the Resident Classification Scales (RCS) were compared using Spearman. s rank order correlations, while discriminative validity was assessed using known-groups technique, comparing ResCareQA results between groups with differing care needs, as well as between male and female residents. Rank-ordered facility results for each clinical care indicator (CCI) were circulated to the panel; upper and lower thresholds for each CCI were nominated by panel members and refined through a Delphi process. These thresholds indicate excellent care at one extreme and questionable care at the other. Results: Minor modifications were made to the assessment, and it was renamed the ResCareQA. Agreement on its content was reached after two Delphi rounds; the final version contains 24 questions across four domains, enabling generation of 36 CCIs. Both test-retest and inter-rater reliability were sound with median kappa values of 0. 74 (test-retest) and 0. 91 (inter-rater); internal consistency was not as strong, with a Chronbach. s alpha of 0. 46. Because the ResCareQA does not provide a single combined score, comparisons for concurrent validity were made with the RCS on an item by item basis, with most resultant correlations being quite low. Discriminative validity analyses, however, revealed highly significant differences in total number of CCIs between high care and low care groups (t 199 = 10. 77, p= 0. 000), while the differences between male and female residents were not significant (t 414 = 0. 56, p= 0. 58). Clinical outcomes varied both within and between facilities; agreed upper and lower thresholds were finalised after three Delphi rounds. Conclusions: The ResCareQA provides a comprehensive, easily administered means of monitoring quality in residential aged care facilities that can be reliably used on multiple occasions. The relatively modest internal consistency score was likely due to the multi-factorial nature of quality, and the absence of an aggregate result for the assessment. Measurement of concurrent validity proved difficult {{in the absence of a}} gold standard, but the sound discriminative validity results suggest that the ResCareQA has acceptable validity and could be confidently used as an indication of care quality within Australian residential aged care facilities. The thresholds, while preliminary due to small sample size, enable users to make judgements about quality within and between facilities. Thus it is recommended the ResCareQA be adopted for wider use...|$|E
40|$|The {{fast-food}} franchise {{industry has}} become one of the fastest growing and most successful segments of its retail sector. This study defines fast food as food that is prepared and served to the consumer in some form of a take-away package. According to the South African Customer Satisfaction Index (SAcsi*), South Africa's fast food industry is ranked second in the world, with a customer satisfaction score of 79 out of 100. South Africans have literally become fast-food junkies embracing large portions of affordable food that are readily accessible and available almost immediately, especially in major urban areas throughout South Africa, like those in Gauteng. The aim of this study was to determine and describe consumers perception of the quality of the service offering of fast-food outlets (in general) and to determine how the additional service offerings of this growing industry determine consumers patronage of fast-food outlets. Objectives were formulated to draw conclusions about consumers satisfaction with the service quality of fast-food outlets based on the expectations-confirmation paradigm in terms of selected demographic characteristics namely gender, age, education level, population group and monthly household income. The quantitative, correlational study was cross-sectional and reflected on perceptions at the specific time of the study and in a specific urban context. Survey data was gathered electronically from 447 respondents implementing a structured, self-administered questionnaire in which the established scale of Oyewole (1999) was used to provide insightful conclusions about consumers perceptions of specific dimensions of the service delivery, namely Hygiene and efficiency; Courtesy; Health consciousness; Child friendliness; Ease of complaint; Comfort; Orderliness; Availability; and Expeditiousness. Data analysis involved descriptive and inferential statistics. Exploratory factor analysis, specifically Principal Axis Factoring, using Oblimin rotation with Kaiser Normalization to determine the underlying factors associated with service quality in fast-food outlets. Confirmatory factor analysis was done using unweighted least squares (ULS) estimation to address multivariate non-normality. Good fit indices were achieved. Calculations of means, standard deviations, <b>Cronbach</b> <b>s</b> Alpha, Anova, t-tests and Post hoc Bonferroni tests were done to identify significant differences between and among different demographics categories for further interpretation. The study concluded that consumers expectations were higher than their perceptions for four of the eight factors, namely: Courtesy and efficiency; Hygiene and precision; Expeditiousness, and Availability. Confirmation of expectations was confirmed for three of the eight factors, namely Orderliness and ease of compliant; Healthiness, and Child friendliness. Positive disconfirmation occurred for only one of the eight factors namely Comfort. Findings indicate that there is ample opportunity for fast-food outlets to improve their service offering in terms of various dimensions and that they could even choose which elements they would want to excel in to achieve a competitive advantage in the Market place. Females have significantly higher expectations than men for five of the eight dimensions of the service offering and therefore it would be more difficult to please females. Young consumers held significantly higher expectations about one of the eight factors namely child friendliness. Particularly interesting is that lower middle income consumers expectations seem significantly higher compared to upper income consumers about health related aspects. White consumers were significantly more concerned about hygiene and efficiency compared to black consumers, whereas the opposite was true for child friendliness. Black consumers expectations also seem significantly higher than white consumers in terms of the healthiness of fast foods. Fast food establishments should take note of the dimensions of the service offering where consumers expectations are high, namely: Hygiene and precision; and Courtesy and efficiency to ensure confirmation as a non-negotiable mode of operation. Fast-food outlets could instigate consumers satisfaction with positive return intentions if they exceed consumers expectations with regards to service dimensions where expectations were not particularly high, for example Child-friendliness, and even Healthiness where consumers expectations are modest.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Psychosocial factors are the interrelated psychological, social and/or behavioural considerations that can influence talent development in football (Holt & Dunn, 2004). Despite this, the significant growth of female football worldwide, and the psychosocial challenges faced by female athletes during adolescence, scant scholarly attention has been afforded {{to the role of}} psychosocial factors in the development of talented female football players. Therefore the main aim of this thesis was to understand psychosocial factors associated with talent development in UK female football players. Study one systematically reviewed the literature on psychosocial factors associated with talent development in soccer. Following an extensive literature searching, selecting and appraisal process, three overarching themes of psychological, social and behavioural factors associated with talent development in soccer - underpinned by a total of 33 subthemes were created. The appraised literature has a moderate-to-high risk of reporting bias; had a significant bias towards adolescent, Caucasian, male, able-bodied, and European soccer players; and extant literature has demonstrated bias towards quantitative approaches and retrospective data collection methods. Consequently, study two began to address these reported biases by longitudinally and prospectively investigating the developmental experiences of English elite female youth soccer players. Through interviews, fieldwork and the use of composite sequence analysis, study two forwarded the importance of psychosocial considerations including the interaction between players and key social agents (soccer fathers, soccer brothers, soccer peers and non- soccer peers), elements of self-regulation and volitional behaviours, and the subsequent developmental benefits for their soccer careers. However, this study did not address the experiences of those who were unsuccessful in their attempts to achieve an elite female soccer career, nor did it collect primary data from other key social agents. Building on the critique of study two, study three sought to adopt an underutilised approach of negative case analysis by examining the experiences of players who had been unsuccessful in their attempts to forge a career in female soccer. Based on interviews former female players, their best friends, coaches and teachers, a grounded theory of talent and career development in UK female youth soccer players was produced. The theory posited that interactions with multiple social agents can affect the quality of talent development and learning environment that a player experiences, which can lead to adaptive player level benefits and changes (e. g., basic psychological need satisfaction; development of pertinent intra-individual constructs; optimal match preparation and training behaviours) and create a greater chance of career success. Study three also forwarded important culturally significant considerations for practitioners working with UK female soccer players, such as an understanding of dual career demands and the impact of role strain on female players. However, study three did not test any of the theoretical predictions offered by the grounded theory. Owing to the need to test predictions of grounded theories to assess their predictive validity, study four sought to test key predictions using a representative sample of English talented and elite adolescent female soccer players (N= 137). As a result of the limited structural stability of the Basic Needs Satisfaction in Sport Scale and the Talent Development Environment Questionnaire (as demonstrated by significant cross loading of items, high bivariate correlations between subscales, and one example of an inadequate <b>Cronbach</b> <b>s</b> alpha), data was parcelled and the revised path hypothesis: perceptions of talent development environment > basic psychological needs satisfaction > career aspirations and beliefs > career intentions was produced. Path analysis supported the hypothesis. Supporting findings of studies two and three, regression analysis demonstrated that playing level positively predicted career beliefs, aspirations and intentions; whereas age negatively predicted these variables. Finally, TDEQ results indicated a perception that UK female soccer players that they can be written off before having the opportunity to fulfil their potential. Overall, this thesis has provided original and unique contributions to the sport psychology literature by enlightening the body of research to the developmental experiences of English female youth soccer players. It provides a developmental understanding scarcely evident in existing talent development literature. The interactional roles of multiple social agents have been elucidated and linked to psychosocial development, behavioural outcomes and talent and career progression within talented female players. The thesis has extended previous approaches to talent development in soccer by testing the predictions of the grounded theory. Initial evidence suggests that the proffered grounded theory is robust; however further research utilising structurally sound and ecologically valid measures would serve to further validate these claims...|$|E
