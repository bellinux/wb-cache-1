50|$|Because of {{the higher}} {{performance}} density, brushless EC drives (electronically commutated motors) with permanent magnet rotors are increasingly used instead of the asynchronous technology. Due to the compact design, the copper content can be cut in half in the best-case scenario. The manufacturers of electric motors also demand more flexibility of the production technology. For producing asynchronous motors, drawing-in systems are usually used that are initially winding air-core coils only to draw them later into the stator {{with the help of}} a tool. In contrast, the <b>concentrated</b> <b>winding</b> of EC stators is more flexible in the manufacturing process, energy saving when implemented, better adjustable during operation and it requires less space.|$|E
50|$|Manufacturing stator {{windings}} in a concentrated manner {{can be performed}} in various ways. The choice of the respective winding process is primarily based on the design and setup of the stator {{as well as the}} commercial aspects. Most stators are designed in a way that allows the application of different winding processes. The stator construction of the full-metal cut which is internally slotted constitutes the only exception. This construction can solely be manufactured by applying the needle-winding technique and in some rare cases the insertion technique for concentrated windings. Most concentrated windings are executed as double-layer windings, i.e. each tooth entails a <b>concentrated</b> <b>winding</b> and two coil phases in each slot. In the case of single-layer winding, the reference tooth of two adjacent tooth coils is not winded. There is always only one phase of one coil found in the slots.|$|E
5000|$|... â€¢ Inside {{slotted stator}} laminationsThe needle-winding {{technique}} basically represents the only feasible winding process for inside slotted stator laminations. The stator mainly {{consists of a}} steel package, two end plates and slot insulation. The particular benefit of this process technology {{lies in the fact}} that the winding machine produces a completely winded assembly group when adequate electrical slot fill factors are employed. If, however, the use of single teeth requires joining and interconnecting operations, all interconnecting measures of the coil sections of one phase may be executed by the winding machine for the stator laminations. In this case, the electric slot fill factor may amount up to 45%. Since manufacturing a functioning stator merely requires a small effort, the negative impact on the electric fill factor is gladly accepted. In order to be able to use various additional functions of the winding machine, the end plates are often designed in a way which allows e.g. the taking on of cutting terminal contacts. In addition, winding space restrictions and laying ducts for the connecting wires of a phase may be integrated.The material costs are also low due to the small number of individual components. In combination with the modest costs of the means of production, stator laminations constitute a practical solution. Three essential basic concepts frequently come to the fore when dealing with the design of stator laminations. Stator laminations for <b>concentrated</b> <b>winding</b> are divided into the following main groups.|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} generator {{design for}} wind power applications. It explains a modern design procedure which uses both analytical and numerical analysis. The numerical analysis uses {{finite element analysis}} and in this report it is performed in Comsol. The report is done {{in cooperation with the}} industrial company, SmartMotor AS. A new Matlab-based script is developed in order to handle the winding layout of distributed windings which will be used in the finite element analysis. The script saves the designer valuable time. A new method that uses Fourier analysis for calculating iron losses for the analyzed geometry is suggested. It is concluded that the Fourier analysis is an incorrect approach as it returns not plausible losses. The new method could however be used without a Fourier analysis. It is concluded that this method is more accurate and less time consuming compared to the method that was used before. In recent papers concentrated windings have been suggested to be more suitable for wind power applications than the conventional distributed windings. In this report distributed <b>winded</b> and <b>concentrated</b> <b>winded</b> generators have been designed and simulated. The results from these simulations are the basis of the comparison. The comparison uses key performance indicators for each machine, which will give an overview of how well the machines perform. In this report it is concluded that both generators offer equal performance regarding voltage waveform and vibrations. The <b>concentrated</b> <b>winded</b> generator does however allow easier manufacturing, better efficiency and shorter length. It is superior in terms of torque per weight.

40|$|The {{transportation}} {{sector is}} responsible for 27 percent of overall greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), and {{this is due to}} a heavy reliance on petroleum-based fuels. Therefore, electrification of transportation is desired to reduce this reliance. Alternative energy sources, mainly solar and horizontal wind, are currently the focus for meeting transportation energy needs. Emerging technologies are being developed, which are suitable for off-grid locations, making them appropriate for meeting transportation energy needs at remote locations, such as many of the National Parks. One such technology, the Solar Vortex (SoV), which was developed at Georgia Tech, relies on <b>concentrated</b> <b>wind</b> to generate power. The National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) currently has GIS resource models representing solar and horizontal wind resources across the 48 conterminous United States. However, a <b>concentrated</b> <b>wind</b> GIS resource model does not exist. A primary objective of this research was to develop a <b>concentrated</b> <b>wind</b> resource model that is comparable in resolution to NREL's existing solar and horizontal wind resource models. This was performed using ArcGIS to calculate sensible and latent heat for the 48 conterminous United States, using MODIS surface heat flux data, and methods used by Ma et al (2010 and 2013) and Bonan (2002). A digital elevation model (DEM) was developed using contour line data from the 1 / 3 arc-second National Elevation Dataset (NED) from USGS. The DEM was then used to create a slope model for the 48 conterminous Unites States, which was created in ArcGIS using ArcPy programming language. A power output estimation model was then developed using R software, which used the calculated sensible heat values to estimate average, monthly power output potential based on actual sensible heat data obtained from Ameriflux. The results from the model were then used in-conjunction with the slope model, and calculated diurnal sensible and latent heat values to develop a final model for estimating power output for the SoV. Using NREL's solar and horizontal wind resource models, suitable locations of parks within the National Parks Service for solar and/or horizontal wind power generation were obtained. Upon completion of the final model, a case study was performed using Zion National Park. Zion was chosen for the case study based on its applicability for using the SoV due to its <b>concentrated</b> <b>wind</b> resource availability, and due to its remote location. The case study provides suggestions for the park based on its potential to use SoV units to power electric park vehicles. Ph. D...|$|R
50|$|For {{quite some}} time, {{asynchronous}} motors with distributed winding {{account for the}} major share of electric motors across the globe. In automobile construction, in particular {{in the area of}} electric mobility, the asynchronous machine with distributed winding can excellently be deployed. It is due to the long history of the asynchronous motor, that this manufacturing process, the insertion technique, is widely applied. In contrast to <b>concentrated</b> <b>winding,</b> not every tooth pole is winded in the case of distributed winding; instead, coils are introduced to the stator slots covering multiple tooth poles. Because of the fact that, due to its tendon-like position of the coils, the already introduced winding covers the stator slots that need to be equipped with coils, it is often necessary to insert a complete phase winding during the same time.Coil insertion machines insert prefabricated groups of coils into the stators of electric motors. The coil groups are frequently manufactured with flyer winding machines and put onto the insertion tool with a transfer instrument. In small-batch manufacturing, the coil groups are relocated manually from the winding masks to the insertion tool using transfer instruments. Subsequently, it is by using the insertion tool that the coil groups are inserted into the previously attached stator whose slots have been insulated with e.g. insulation paper. When diagonally winding the coil into the slot of the stator, the coil's internal width must be larger than the stator's height which leads to the formation of the large winding head that is characteristic for the insertion technique.|$|E

The low resource investment and ease of installation make it ideal for these scenarios; however, it is limited by the availability of a stable power source. Only 13 % of the worldâ€™s land area experiences wind speeds high enough to be usable by current technology. To improve this percentage, the use of wind concentrators has been suggested. A turbine within a concentrator would experience a higher wind speed than the surrounding body of air, reducing the ambient wind speed requirement to generate electricity. In this thesis, several concentrator designs were tested. In this thesis, several designs of the following concentrator components were tested: a flow straightener, vortex breaker, and pressure relief slits. Fluent 12. 1, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program, was used to model air flow patterns through a prototype wind concentrator and optimize its performance.

Migrant flocks of 250 to 50, 000 were observed on coastal farmfields, dumps and estuaries, on beaches and mudflats, and up to 45 km offshore. Bathing and foraging flocks ranged in size from 20 to 500 birds, and most flocks were monospecific, with occasional grey-headed (Larus cirrocephalus) and band-tailed (L. belcheri) on the periphery. While previous notes report Franklinâ€™s gulls foraging coastally, we found flocks feeding up to 45 km offshore by diving for prey or feeding on the water. The relative percentage of birds of the year varied in migrant flocks from zero to 14 %, with lower numbers of young foraging aerially on insects (only 1 %). The percentage of young feeding over the ocean decreased with increasing distance from shore; no young of the year were recorded at 36 - 44 km offshore. While there were large flocks of Franklinâ€™s gulls resting on the water inshore, the number of gulls foraging offshore did not decline up to 45 km offshore.
