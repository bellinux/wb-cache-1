[...] "All this leads to 9 litres of motor car and a very brave Sydney Allard surrounded by <b>chains,</b> <b>shafts</b> and engines." [...] The car featured a solidly-mounted rear axle to which he planned to mount American-type dragster slick tyres. This was an early indication of the influence of American drag racing on his designs. The car was never successfully run and soon abandoned.|$|R
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to turbochargers, superchargers are mechanically {{driven by the}} engine. Belts, <b>chains,</b> <b>shafts,</b> and gears are common methods of powering a supercharger, placing a mechanical load on the engine. For example, on the single-stage single-speed supercharged Rolls-Royce Merlin engine, the supercharger uses about [...] Yet the benefits outweigh the costs; for the [...] to drive the supercharger the engine generates an additional 400-horsepower, {{a net gain of}} [...] This is where the principal disadvantage of a supercharger becomes apparent; the engine must withstand the net power output of the engine plus the power to drive the supercharger.|$|R
50|$|In 1913 {{the engine}} was {{replaced}} by a water-cooled Precision, V twin of 964 cc. There were other improvements including changing the brakes to internal expanding and replacing the <b>chain</b> with <b>shaft</b> drive. The price rose to £135.|$|R
5000|$|The first steam {{tractors}} {{that were}} designed specifically for agricultural uses were portable engines built on skids or on wheels and transported to the work area using horses. Later models used {{the power of the}} steam engine itself to power a drive train to move the machine and were first known as [...] "traction drive" [...] engines which eventually was shortened to [...] "tractor". These drive mechanisms were one of three types: <b>chain,</b> <b>shaft,</b> and open pinion. The open pinion became the most popular design due to its strength. Later improvements included power steering, differentials, compounded engines, and butt-strap boiler design.|$|E
50|$|Many people {{argue that}} Édouard Delamare-Deboutteville and his assistant, Leon Malandin had invented the first automobile. Édouard Delamare-Deboutteville {{described}} {{how he had}} built and driven his car in early 1884. The car had a front bench seat and a rear platform, four wheels, a transmission to the rear wheels by <b>chain,</b> <b>shaft</b> transmission and a differential. In 1883 Edouard Delamare-Deboutteville run his car whose engine was powered by gas, but the gas supply hose broke during this first trial, so he replaced the gas with fuel oil. In order to use this product, he invented a wick carburetor. This vehicle travelled {{for the first time}} on the little road from Fontaine-le Bourg to Cailly, Normandy in early February 1884. On 12 February 1884, he registered his design under patent number 160267.|$|E

The Kz1000 came {{with either a}} <b>chain</b> or <b>shaft</b> drive after 1979.The frame on the Kz1000 is a very conventional featherbed design, but was not significantly changed in over 30 years of production.|$|R
50|$|Rokon {{motorcycles}} use {{a combination}} of belt, <b>chain</b> and <b>shaft</b> drives coupled to gear boxes to drive both the front and rear wheels. Older machines were powered by a West Bend (US Motor/Chrysler Marine) 820 two-stroke engine (134cc), while newer machines have either a Honda or Kohler engine of about 6hp. Each hollow wheel is able to hold 2.5 gallons of gasoline or water for long distance trips.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} braking systems, one hand {{operated}} {{and the other}} by foot. The main brake was the hand brake which acted on the rear wheels which had 30 cm drums. The secondary, foot brake, acted on the <b>chain</b> drive's intermediate <b>shaft</b> and was water-cooled.|$|R
5000|$|For two-wheeled {{vehicles}} such as motorcycles and bicycles, {{the term}} is used to describe vehicles which can power the front {{as well as the}} back wheel. The term 2×2 is also used to denote two total wheels with both being driven. 2×2 vehicles are typically either mechanically driven via <b>chain</b> or <b>shaft</b> or are hydraulic driven. This scheme greatly improves offroad performance, but is quite complicated and requires more power to operate, thus most 2WD machines are either [...] "exotic" [...] bikes for enthusiasts or created with special uses in mind.|$|R
50|$|The QR25DE is a 2.5 L (2488 cc) variant {{built with}} cast steel {{connecting}} rods, a steel timing <b>chain,</b> counter-rotating balance <b>shafts,</b> and an aluminum intake manifold.

50|$|In Britain, small diesel and petrol {{locomotives}} {{are usually}} {{classified in the}} same way as steam locomotives, e.g. 0-4-0, 0-6-0, 0-8-0. This may be followed by D for diesel or P for petrol, and another letter describing the transmission: E for electric, H hydraulic, M mechanical. Thus 0-6-0DE denotes a six-wheel diesel locomotive with electric transmission. Where the axles are coupled by <b>chains</b> or <b>shafts</b> (rather than side rods) or are individually driven, the terms 4w, 6w or 8w are generally used. Thus 4wPE indicates a four-wheel petrol locomotive with electric transmission. For large diesel locomotives the UIC classification is used.|$|R
5000|$|Motorcycle {{engines are}} {{typically}} two-stroke or four-stroke internal combustion engines, but other engine types (such as Wankels and electric motors) {{have been used}} in small numbers. Although some mopeds had friction drive to the front tyre, a motorcycle engine invariably drives the rear wheel, power being sent to the driven wheel by belt, <b>chain</b> or <b>shaft</b> [...] Most engines have a gearbox with up to six ratios. Reverse gear is occasionally found on heavy tourers [...] and sidecar motorcycles. [...] Gear changes are normally effected using a foot-pedal and manual clutch, but early models had hand-levers.

5000|$|The pulleys on the jackshafts of mills {{or power}} plants were {{frequently}} {{connected to the}} shaft with clutches. For example, in the 1890s, the generating room of the Virginia Hotel in Chicago had two Corliss engines and five dynamos, linked through a jackshaft. Clutches on the jackshaft pulleys allowed {{any or all of}} the dynamos to be driven by either or both of the engines. [...] With the advent of chain-drive vehicles, the term jackshaft was generally applied to the final intermediate shaft in the drive train, either a <b>chain</b> driven <b>shaft</b> driving pinions that directly engaged teeth {{on the inside of the}} rims of the drive wheels, or the output shaft of the transmission/differential that is linked by chain to the drive wheels.|$|R
50|$|Engineer and {{inventor}} Aurel Vlaicu, who {{was among}} the first pilots in Romania, began the design of the third in his series of powered aircraft {{in the second half of}} 1911. The design was based on his earlier A Vlaicu II. A nacelle underneath a parasol wing housed the pilot and a Gnome Gamma engine. Gears, <b>chains</b> and <b>shafts</b> drove two propellers, one in front of and one behind the wing; these turned in opposite directions to cancel each other's torque. Like Vlaicu's other designs, the A. Vlaicu III did not have ailerons. The pilot turned the aircraft by using the rudder, controlled by moving a tiller left or right; to control the elevators and make the aircraft go up and down, a steering wheel attached to the tiller was turned left or right.|$|R
50|$|Automated {{systems are}} {{becoming}} more prominent. They have the potential advantages of relatively high precision, speed and ease of control, but tend to be significantly more expensive than manual systems. Hoists of various types (e.g., line <b>shaft,</b> <b>chain</b> motor, etc.) are used. A conventional counterweight system may be automated by the incorporation of a motor and controls, in what is commonly called a motor-assist system. By using counterweight in such a manner, motor sizes can be kept relatively small.|$|R
50|$|Two new Hornets shown were: a four-door saloon and an {{occasional}} four on a new 7 ft 11ins wheelbase. The engines of the new cars had a single camshaft drive {{in place of the}} earlier two-stage <b>chain</b> drive. Propeller <b>shaft</b> universal joints were now metal in place of their fabric predecessors. On the freewheel cars the frame was now underslung at the rear. Automatic restarting of the engine was provided. Electric direction indicators were now built into the body pillars.|$|R
50|$|Drive shafts {{are another}} common method used to move {{mechanical}} power around that is sometimes evaluated {{in comparison to}} chain drive; in particular belt drive vs <b>chain</b> drive vs <b>shaft</b> drive is a key design decision for most motorcycles. Drive shafts tend to be tougher and more reliable than chain drive, but the bevel gears have far more friction than a chain.For this reason virtually all high-performance motorcycles use chain drive, with shaft-driven arrangements generally used for non-sporting machines. Toothed-belt drives are used for some (non-sporting) models.|$|R
50|$|When Romarsh collapsed, John Malfoy {{bought the}} {{remaining}} parts and assembled several more machines, and Malcolm Newell independently {{made at least}} one more from parts. Only 21 Reliant engined Quasars were produced, but Newell went on to build several more in his own workshop at Field Cottage, in Heddington. These later Quasars were fitted with motorcycle engines and several also had a Bob Tait-designed hub centre steering system, as did some of Malcolm's Phasars. The later machines included several with Suzuki GS engines, both <b>chain</b> and <b>shaft</b> drive, a Honda VF750 powered machine and one with a Kawasaki Z1300 6-cylinder engine. Malcolm also produced a whole range of Phasar machines powered by engines from the Honda Goldwing and VT500, Moto Guzzi V50 and Convert, Z13, and Yamaha liquid-cooled 350s. He was working on a leaning trike, with two narrow leaning front wheels when he died in 1994, aged just 54.|$|R
50|$|A {{computer-controlled}} {{dobby loom}} takes this {{one step further}} by replacing the mechanical dobby <b>chain</b> with computer-controlled <b>shaft</b> selection. In addition {{to being able to}} handle sequences that are virtually unlimited, the construction of the shaft sequences is done on the computer screen rather than by building a mechanical dobby chain. This allows the weaver to load and switch weave drafts in seconds without even getting up from the loom. In addition, the design process performed on the computer provides the weaver with a more intuitive way to design fabric; seeing the pattern on a computer screen is easier than trying to visualize it by looking at the dobby chain.|$|R
50|$|The {{input of}} the clutch is {{connected}} to the engine crankshaft while the output may drive a <b>shaft,</b> <b>chain,</b> or belt. As engine revolutions per minute increase, weighted arms in the clutch swing outward and force the clutch to engage. The most common types have friction pads or shoes radially mounted that engage the inside of the rim of a housing. On the center shaft there are an assorted number of extension springs, which connect to a clutch shoe. When the central shaft spins fast enough, the springs extend causing the clutch shoes to engage the friction face. It can be compared to a drum brake in reverse. This type can be found on most home built karts, lawn and garden equipment, fuel-powered model cars and low power chainsaws. Another type used in racing karts has friction and clutch disks stacked together like a motorcycle clutch. The weighted arms force these disks together and engage the clutch.|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 3 rd Southern African Solar Energy Conference, South Africa, 11 - 13 May, 2015. A cart is a vehicle designed for transport, using two wheels and normally pulled by one or a pair of draught animals. A solar vehicle is an electric vehicle which supplies {{all or most of}} its required power by converting solar radiation into electricity with the help of solar cells. The aim of this work is to design and develop a solar assisted electric cart {{that can be used for}} carrying loads and transporting people by villagers and farmers and also to reduce animal drudgery. As an initial investigation, the physical data of conventional cart used by farmers are collected based on which the motor and various parts of vehicle namely; <b>Chain</b> drive, <b>Shaft,</b> Suspension, Brakes etc. are selected for final development of cart. The FEM analysis is carried out to study the stress and displacements of the cart in order to ensure the safety. The basic performance of cart is evaluated in terms of its range, acceleration and maximum achievable speed. The final weight of cart so designed is 620 kg and load carrying capacityis found to be 800 kg. The achievable acceleration of cart is calculated as 1. 2 m/s 2 with maximum achievable speed of 15 km/h with a power rating of about 1. 5 kW out of which about 11. 4 % power is derived from solar radiation. The range of the cart is calculated as 44. 75 km which seems to be reasonable for rural areas. dc 201...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} part of the USQ Motorsport team entry in its first Formula SAE-A competition. The project aim is to design the drivetrain, brakes and wheels of the car which was the focus of {{developed}} in this project. The design must also be optimized to provide for a competitive racing car. The investigation into these areas starts with research into the possible systems available to be adapted to the racing car. The interfaces between each area of the racing car means working {{with other members of the}} team to decide on viable options is required. Teamwork is therefore essential for the success of the overall project to complete the construction and perform well at the Formula SAE-A competition. A design is developed for the drivetrain and detailed analysis of the design is conducted. The main component of the drivetrain is the centre shaft which is analysed to find the stresses and fatigue life. Associated components of the drivetrain such as rear sprocket, <b>chain,</b> bearings, half <b>shafts</b> and <b>chain</b> tensioner are also designed to complete the drivetrain assembly. The brakes and wheels have also started with background research followed by a detailed selection process to find the best option. Consideration is also required as to how all the components will fit together to provide a car that is well designed and has good performance characteristics. The finial construction and procurement of the components making up the drivetrain, brakes and wheels was on track for completion to enter the Formula SAE-A competition...|$|R
