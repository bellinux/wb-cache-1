5|$|In {{observing a}} {{multitude}} of biographies and funerary inscriptions, Hymes states that officials in the Northern Song era displayed a primary preoccupation with national interests, as they did not intervene in local or <b>central</b> <b>government</b> affairs {{for the benefit of}} their local prefecture or county. This trend was reversed in the Southern Song. Since the majority of <b>central</b> <b>government</b> officials in the Southern Song came from the macroregion of Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian, Hartwell and Hymes state that there was a great amount of ad hoc local interests represented in <b>central</b> <b>government</b> policies.|$|E
5|$|Since commandery-issued coins {{were often}} of {{inferior}} quality and lighter weight, the <b>central</b> <b>government</b> closed commandery mints and monopolized {{the issue of}} coinage in 113 BC.

5|$|Although {{decentralization}} {{of state}} power within the provinces occurred in the early Ming, the trend of <b>central</b> <b>government</b> officials delegated to the provinces as virtual provincial governors began in the 1420s. By the late Ming dynasty, there were <b>central</b> <b>government</b> officials delegated to two or more provinces as supreme commanders and viceroys, a system which reined in the power and influence of the military by the civil establishment.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the quiet yet pervasive transfer of power from <b>central</b> <b>governments</b> to subnational units in Africa since the early 1990 s. <b>Central</b> <b>governments</b> have justified this trend by arguing it promotes {{one or more of}} three goods: democracy, development, and accommodating diversity. The authors survey six selected countries representing federal-unitary and regional differences to evaluate their degree of formal and substantive political, administrative, and financial autonomy. Transfer of powers to subnational units, the authors conclude, is a real and nearly universal trend. However, many <b>central</b> <b>governments</b> have clawed back this grant of power in numerous ways, which led to an informal recentralization of power. Moreover, <b>central</b> <b>governments</b> of federations have deliberately strengthened local government at the expense of regional autonomy. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

Amir accepted the position readily, subsequently handling numerous tasks set by the <b>central</b> <b>government,</b> including inaugurating the first local division of the People's Safety Army (Tentara Keamanan Rakjat; the predecessor to the Indonesian Army) opening meetings of various local branches of national political parties, and promoting education– particularly Latin-alphabet literacy.|$|E

5|$|As {{a second}} level {{administrative}} division municipalities are the third tier of public {{administration in the}} Netherlands after the <b>central</b> <b>government</b> and the provinces. The Netherlands is a decentralized unitary state, {{which means that the}} <b>central</b> <b>government</b> is supreme and delegates certain tasks to lower levels of government by law. The different levels do, however, make work agreements, which give municipalities a certain degree of independence in their policy decisions. Municipalities are responsible {{for a wide variety of}} public services, which include land-use planning, public housing, management and maintenance of local roads, waste management and social security. After the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010 three special municipalities (officially public bodies) were formed. These municipalities function the same as regular municipalities and are grouped together as the Caribbean Netherlands and are not part of a province.|$|E

5|$|During {{his early}} career, Caesar had seen how chaotic and {{dysfunctional}} the Roman Republic had become.

Between his crossing of the Rubicon river in 49 BC, and his assassination in 44 BC, Caesar established a new constitution, which was intended to accomplish three separate goals. First, he wanted to suppress all armed resistance out in the provinces, and thus bring order back to the empire. Second, he wanted to create a strong <b>central</b> <b>government</b> in Rome. And finally, he wanted to knit together the entire empire into a single cohesive unit.|$|E
