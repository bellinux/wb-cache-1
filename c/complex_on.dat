40|$|Ascending and {{descending}} Morse complexes, {{determined by}} a scalar field f defined over a manifold M, induce a subdivision of M into regions associated with critical points of f, and compactly represent the topology of M. We define two simplification operators <b>on</b> Morse <b>complexes,</b> which work in arbitrary dimensions, and we define their inverse refinement operators. We describe how simplification and refinement operators affect Morse <b>complexes</b> <b>on</b> M, and we show that these operators form {{a complete set of}} atomic operators to create and update Morse <b>complexes</b> <b>on</b> M. Thus, any operator that modifies Morse <b>complexes</b> <b>on</b> M can be expressed as a suitable sequence of the atomic simplification and refinement operators we have defined. The simplification and refinement operators also provide a suitable basis {{for the construction of a}} multi-resolution representation of Morse complexes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe report {{intriguing}} {{aspects of}} the contribution of IL- 15 Rα to IL- 15 functions. Consistent with high-affinity interactions between IL- 15 and IL- 15 Rα, these two molecules form stable <b>complexes</b> <b>on</b> the cell surface of activated monocytes. The formation of IL- 15 /IL- 15 Rα <b>complexes</b> <b>on</b> cell surfaces induces a trans-endosomal recycling of IL- 15 leading to the persistence of surface-bound IL- 15 due to the constantreappearance of IL- 15 on plasma membranes. This complex contributes to the long survival of T cells expressing IL- 15 Rα after IL- 15 withdrawal. Finally, these <b>complexes</b> <b>on</b> activated monocytes present IL- 15 in trans to target cells such as CD 8 + T cells that express only IL- 2 / 15 Rβ and γc upon cell-cell interaction...|$|R

Functional transcription <b>complexes</b> <b>on</b> somatic 5 S RNA genes in nucleated erythrocytes of Xenopus are stable for weeks, perhaps months, even though a mature erythrocyte has less than two molecules of TFIIIA for each somatic 5 S RNA gene.

5|$|In the {{original}} Nike-X plans, Sprint {{was the primary}} weapon and thus {{was considered to be}} an extremely high-priority development. To speed development, a sub-scale version of Sprint known as Squirt was tested from Launch Complex 37 at White Sands, the former Nike Ajax/Hercules test area.

The first Sprint Propulsion Test Vehicle (PTV) was launched from another area at the same <b>complex</b> <b>on</b> 17 November 1965, only 25 months after the final design was signed off.

The relaxation processes subsequent to the HS LS conversion on site B reveal a light-induced HSLS bistability for the <b>complexes</b> <b>on</b> site B at 70 K. The bistability {{as well as the}} absence of a thermal spin transition on site B are attributed to a thermal hysteresis for the B-site complexes with a critical temperature Tc 77 K on heating.

In contrast, the HS LS relaxation at 60 K on site A after irradiation with = 514. 5 nm shows an unusual self-retardation...|$|R
