5|$|The {{trial began}} in the High Court of Justice on 30 January 1893, before Sir Henry Hawkins; Bottomley {{conducted}} his own defence. To most observers the case against him seemed impregnable. It was established that, through his nominees, Bottomley had repeatedly bought companies for {{far less than the}} prices approved by the Hansard Union directors, and had pocketed the difference. Bottomley did not deny this, insisting that use of nominees was an accepted commercial practice, and that his actual profits had been much smaller than reported; his expenses, he said, had been enormous. He was helped in his case by the slackness with which the prosecution presented its evidence, and their failure to <b>call</b> <b>key</b> witnesses. He was further helped by the indulgence which Hawkins showed him, and by his own convincing oratory. The essence of his argument was that he was the victim of machinations by the Official Receiver and the Debenture Corporation, who had been determined to win prestige by bringing Bottomley down and wrecking his company. On 26 April, after Hawkins had summed up massively in his favour, Bottomley was acquitted, along with the other defendants.|$|E

[...] Although he promoted the testimonials of former students and argued that a schoolmaster was unlikely to [...] "so lightly jeopardize his ambitions", he congratulated Locock on the accuracy of his testimony in open court. Ballantine did not <b>call</b> <b>key</b> witnesses like Edward Philpott, another student of Hopley's who {{had been at the}} house that night. [...] Philpott slept in the bedroom beside Cancellor's and had reported hearing no unusual noises or screams from Cancellor's room on the night of his death. Neither did Ballantine call Professor John Eric Erichsen of University College Hospital, who had conducted a second autopsy on Cancellor on 11May and had suggested that [...] "the misleading appearance of the body was attributable to an undiagnosed blood condition akin to haemophilia". In his memoir Some experiences of a barrister's life, published in 1883, Ballantine offered a highly sensationalised account of Cancellor's death: [...] "the wretched half-witted victim of a lunatic's system of education was deliberately mangled to death".|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} an M/G/ 1 retrial queueing system with {{two types of}} calls which models a telephone switching system. In the case that arriving calls are blocked due to the channel being busy, the outgoing calls are queued in priority group whereas the incoming calls enter the retrial group {{in order to try}} service again after a random amount of time. In this paper we find the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the distribution of the virtual waiting time for an incoming call.

40|$|Using the United Kingdom as a {{case study}} to explore the degree to which news about a second-order {{election}} is mediatized, this comparative content analysis examines television news coverage of the 2014 European Union elections. Evidence of mediatization was stronger on the most commercially driven bulletins, with an overwhelming emphasis on the game frame and a more interpretive approach than the most public service–orientated broadcaster (the BBC). However, qualitative analysis revealed that the BBC pursued a more mediatized form of journalism. Developing a close textual analysis of how broadcasters reported party campaign launches—representing what we <b>call</b> <b>key</b> “mediatized moments”—we argue that a more qualitative approach to assessing media and political logics can complement comparative quantitative studies about mediatized politics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Despite {{realistic}} concerns, {{security is}} still absent from ve-hicular buses (such as CAN) mostly due to technical challenges: low bandwidth and processing power, low cost margins, etc. Here we design an efficient protocol based entirely on simple symmetric primitives that {{takes advantage of}} two interesting procedures which we <b>call</b> <b>key</b> splitting and MAC mixing. Rather than achieving authentication independently on each node, we share keys between groups of nodes {{which leads to a}} higher security level in case when compromised nodes form only a minority. Based on practical arguments, we recognize this assumption to be realistic for automotive networks. Subsequently, amalgamating regular message authentication codes with systems of linear equations increases the chances for a forgery to be detected. We present several protocol variants that are extremely flexible and set way for different trade-offs on bus load, computational cost and security level, taking into account the most recent developments such as the recently release...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Security in {{vehicular}} networks established {{itself as}} a highly active re-search area {{in the last few}} years. However, {{there are only a few}} results so far on assuring security for communication buses inside vehicles. Here we advocate the use of a protocol based entirely on simple symmetric primitives that takes advantage of two interesting procedures which we <b>call</b> <b>key</b> splitting and MAC mixing. Rather than achieving authentication independently for each node, we split authentication keys between groups of multiple nodes. This leads to a more efficient progressive authentication that is effective especially in the case when compromised nodes form only a minority and we believe such an assumption to be realistic in automotive networks. To gain more security we also account an interesting construction in which message authentication codes are amalgamated using systems of linear equations. We study several protocol variants which are extremely flexible allowing different trade-offs on bus load, computational cost and security level. Experimental results are presented on state-of-the-art Infineon TriCore controllers which are contrasted with low end controllers with Freescal...|$|E
