The base of the furnace is a hearth of refractory material (bricks or castable refractory).

50|$|Franklin bells (also {{known as}} Gordon’s Bells or {{lightning}} bells) are an early demonstration of electric charge {{designed to work}} with a Leyden jar. Franklin bells are only a qualitative indicator of electric charge and were used for simple demonstrations rather than research. This was the first device that converted electrical energy into mechanical energy in the form of continuous mechanical motion, in this case, the moving of a bell clapper back and forth between two oppositely <b>charged</b> <b>bells.</b>|$|R

50|$|Delaborde {{described}} the instrument in his 1761 publication, Le clavessin électrique. The mechanism {{was based on}} a contemporary warning-bell device, and the instrument is essentially an electric carillon. A number of bells, two for each pitch, hang from iron bars along with their clappers (one for each pair). A globe generator charges the prime conductor and the iron bars. The musician presses a key and one of the bells of the corresponding pair is grounded, cut off from the charge source. The clapper then oscillates between the grounded and the <b>charged</b> <b>bells,</b> producing the desired tone.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} 1956 consent decree against the Bell System to {{investigate}} whether patents held by a dominant firm are harmful for innovation and if so, whether compulsory licensing can provide an effective remedy. The consent decree settled an antitrust lawsuit that <b>charged</b> <b>Bell</b> with having foreclosed the market for telecommunications equipment. The terms of the decree allowed Bell to remain a vertically integrated monopolist in the telecommunications industry, but as a remedy, Bell had to license all its existing patents royalty-free. Thus, the path-breaking technologies developed by the Bell Laboratories became freely available to all US companies. We show {{that in the first}} five years compulsory licensing increased follow-on innovation building on Bell patents by 17 %. This effect is driven mainly by young and small companies. Yet, innovation increased only outside the telecommunications equipment industry. The lack of a positive innovation effect in the telecommunications industry suggests that market foreclosure impedes innovation and that compulsory licensing without structural remedies is ineffective in ending it. The increase of follow-on innovation by small and young companies is in line with the hypothesis that patents held by a dominant firm act as a barrier to entry for start-ups. We show that the removal of this barrier increased long-run U. S. innovation, corroborating historical account...|$|R

50|$|The central bell's {{chain is}} put {{in contact with the}} inner surface of a Leyden jar, while the outside surface of the jar {{is put in}} contact with the metal stand. Thus, the central <b>bell</b> takes its <b>charge</b> from the inner surface of the jar, while the outer surface <b>charges</b> the two <b>bells</b> on the {{conductive}} chains. This causes the bells to have a difference in electrical potential equal to that between the inner and outer surfaces of the jar. The hanging metal clappers will be attracted to one bell, will touch it, pick up its charge, and be repelled; they will then swing across to the other bell, and do the same there. Each time the clappers touch a <b>bell,</b> <b>charge</b> is transferred between the inner and outer surfaces of the Leyden jar. When the jar is completely discharged, the bells will stop ringing.|$|R
