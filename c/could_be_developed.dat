5|$|But {{daunting}} {{technical problems}} remained. Raeder wanted newer planes, {{specifically designed for}} carrier use. Reichsmarshall Hermann Göring, head of the Luftwaffe, replied that the already overburdened German aircraft industry could not possibly complete the design, testing and mass production of such aircraft before 1946. Instead, he proposed converting existing aircraft (again the Junkers Ju 87 and Messerschmitt Bf 109) as a temporary solution until newer types <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed.</b> Training of carrier pilots at Travemünde would also resume.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the Common Cold Unit {{was set up}} by the Medical Research Council in 1946 and it {{was where}} the {{rhinovirus}} was discovered in 1956. In the 1970s, the CCU demonstrated that treatment with interferon during the incubation phase of rhinovirus infection protects somewhat against the disease, but no practical treatment <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed.</b> The unit was closed in 1989, two years after it completed research of zinc gluconate lozenges in the prophylaxis and treatment of rhinovirus colds, the only successful treatment {{in the history of the}} unit.|$|E
5|$|The Australian 2/6th Independent Company flew {{in to the}} Markham Valley from Port Moresby in 13 USAAF C-47 Dakotas, {{making a}} {{difficult}} landing on a rough airstrip. Unaware that a much larger Japanese force was also headed for Kaiapit, the company attacked the village on 19 September to secure the area so that it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> into an airfield. The company then held it against a strong counterattack. During two days of fighting the Australians defeated a larger Japanese force while suffering relatively few losses.|$|E

Lothian Buses also maintain three Travel Shops at Waverley Bridge, Hanover Street and Haymarket..|$|E
5|$|There was {{considerable}} local {{opposition to the}} Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy {{would be unable to}} thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed.</b> To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.|$|E
50|$|This {{idea was}} soon brought to fruition. First, a {{printing}} emulsion <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> using silver chloride.

Notably an approach by which intact membranes <b>could</b> <b>be</b> studied <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> and applied to plate-like and tubular supported zeolitic membranes. Transport processes were studied experimentally and theoretically based on the characterization studies...|$|R
5|$|At {{a meeting}} of the S-1 Executive Committee on 14 November 1942, Chadwick had {{expressed}} a fear that the alpha particles emitted by plutonium could produce neutrons in light elements present as impurities, which in turn would produce fission in the plutonium and cause a predetonation, a chain reaction before the core was fully assembled. This had been considered by Oppenheimer and Seaborg the month before, and the latter had calculated that neutron emitters like boron had to be restricted to one part in a hundred billion. There was some doubt about whether a chemical process <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> that could ensure this level of purity, and Chadwick brought the matter to the S-1 Executive Committee's attention for it to be considered further. Four days later, though, Lawrence, Oppenheimer, Compton and McMillan reported to Conant that they had confidence that the exacting purity requirement could be met.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its lack}} of industry, the company still found itself with {{thousands}} of acres of land that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed.</b> William M. Ladd, who had succeeded Reed as President of Oregon Iron and Steel and his father as President of Ladd & Tilton Bank, formed the Ladd Estate Company to manage these real estate assets. The newly formed Ladd Estate Company converted the depressed company town into a prestigious suburb complete with country club, golf course, polo field, and even worked to rename the harsh-sounding Sucker Lake to Oswego Lake. The company existed as a shell until 1960, when in its final act, it deeded its powerhouse and dams to lake shareholders.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 he {{attended}} the Project Nobska anti-submarine warfare conference, where discussion ranged from oceanography to nuclear weapons. In the course of discussing a small nuclear warhead for the Mark 45 torpedo, he started a discussion {{on the possibility of}} developing a physically small one-megaton nuclear warhead for the Polaris missile. His counterpart in the discussion, J. Carson Mark from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, at first insisted it could not be done. However, Dr. Mark eventually stated that a half-megaton warhead of small enough size <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed.</b> This yield, roughly thirty times that of the Hiroshima bomb, was enough for Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke, who was present in person, and Navy strategic missile development shifted from Jupiter to Polaris {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E

40|$|Routing {{in mobile}} adhoc network is an {{unresolved}} issue. Much {{effort has been}} undergoing to invent a mechanism for achieving efficient and reliable routing in mobile adhoc networks. In this paper we presented a routing algorithm at very abstract level for mobile adhoc networks. The proposed algorithm adopts an intermediate approach in between the two existing techniques i. e. Table driven and on demand routing. We believe, efficient routing in mobile adhoc network <b>could</b> <b>be</b> achieved if route discovery and data delivery could occur at the same time, based on the presented algorithm a more advance form <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>develop</b> which would <b>be</b> helpful in providing a effective solution for the routing problem of mobile adhoc networks. ...|$|R
5|$|In 2009 the Welsh Assembly Government asked Network Rail {{to conduct}} {{feasibility}} studies on two former track stretches in Wales, {{one of those}} being the line from Bangor to Llangefni. Councillor Clive McGregor was optimistic this could provide an economic stimulus for Anglesey, along with further proposals to extend passenger traffic between Llangefni and Amlwch. In 2011 Network Rail began work on gathering evidence for its study, beginning with cutting away vegetation on track sections to examine the condition of rails and track bedding. Its report {{was expected to be}} published in 2012, before any business cases to reopen the lines <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{availability}} {{of real estate}} data is clearly limited in Chile, which makes more complex {{the discussion of the}} possible vulnerabilities of households and the financial sector to risks arising from real estate markets. This paper proposes a set of housing price indicators for measuring the potential pressures that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>developing</b> in the credit market. Using these price measures, we find that the recent sustained rise in home prices coincides with the sustained increase in disposable income and the decreasing trend of long-term interest rates, factors that have strongly driven the expansion of mortgage loans. ...|$|R

50|$|Using the Golgi method, Giuseppe Magini then {{studied the}} {{mammalian}} fetal cerebral cortex in 1888, confirming the similar presence of elongated radial {{cells in the}} cortex (also described by Kölliker just before him), and observing “various varicosities or swellings” on the radial fibers. Intrigued, Magini also observed that the size and number of these varicosities increased later in development, and were absent in the adult nervous system. Based on these findings, Magini then hypothesized that these varicosities <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>developing</b> neurons. Using a combination Golgi and hematoxylin staining method, Magini was able to identify these varicosities as cells, {{some of which were}} very closely associated with the radial fibers.|$|R
