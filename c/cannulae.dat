25|$|The {{arm of the}} {{condemned}} person is swabbed with alcohol before the cannula is inserted. The needles and equipment used are sterilized. Questions have been raised about why these precautions against infection are performed despite {{the purpose of the}} injection being death. The several explanations include: <b>cannulae</b> are sterilized during manufacture, so using sterile ones is routine medical procedure. Secondly, the prisoner could receive a stay of execution after the <b>cannulae</b> have been inserted, as happened in the case of James Autry in October 1983 (he was eventually executed on March 14, 1984). Third, use of unsterilized equipment would be a hazard to prison personnel.|$|E

Dedicated fine bore <b>cannulas</b> have significantly reduced the incidence of thrombophlebitis. Currently available <b>cannulas</b> are made of polyurethane or silicone. We present our experience with a 23 G silicone <b>cannula</b> and a 22 G polyurethane alternative. Fifty-four silicone <b>cannulas</b> were used with a median survival of only 3 days, compared with 7 days for 90 polyurethane <b>cannulas</b> (P < 0. 0001). Only 22 % of silicone <b>cannulas</b> were removed electively compared with 56 % of polyurethane <b>cannulas</b> (P < 0. 00005). The most common cause for silicone <b>cannula</b> removal was occlusion (48 %), which occurred in only 8 % of polyurethane <b>cannulas</b> (P < 0. 00001).

25|$|Spinal {{anesthesia}} {{was first}} used in 1885, but not introduced into clinical practice until 1899, when August Bier subjected himself to a clinical experiment in which he observed the anesthetic effect, but also the typical side effect of postpunctural headache. Within a few years, spinal anesthesia became widely used for surgical anesthesia and was accepted as a safe and effective technique. Although atraumatic (noncutting-tip) <b>cannulae</b> and modern drugs are used today, the technique has otherwise changed very little over many decades.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveA {{femoral artery}} <b>cannula</b> {{is used for}} certain types of circulatory support but can cause ischemia, {{especially}} during prolonged perfusion. This study tests the function of a femoral <b>cannula</b> designed to allow proximal and distal blood flow. MethodsFive pigs {{were used in the}} study. In each animal a distal-flow <b>cannula</b> was implanted in the femoral artery of one leg, and the same-sized standard <b>cannula</b> was implanted in the other. Blood was drained from the left atrium and delivered to the femoral artery through the distal-flow <b>cannula</b> or standard <b>cannula</b> by using a centrifugal pump. An ultrasonic flow probe and microspheres were used to quantify flow and perfusion distal to the <b>cannula.</b> ResultsDistal femoral flow and tissue perfusion were present in all animals (5 / 5) with the distal-flow <b>cannula</b> but only in 1 of 5 animals with the standard <b>cannula</b> (P <. 048). Distal flow did not change with pump flow. Mean distal flow at each level of pump flow was higher with the distal-flow <b>cannula</b> (P <. 05). Tissue perfusion was also higher with the distal-flow <b>cannula</b> (0. 052 ± 0. 028 vs 0. 010 ± 0. 022 mL·min− 1 ·g− 1, P <. 03). ConclusionsIn the swine model the distal-flow <b>cannula</b> allowed greater and more consistent distal flow than the standard <b>cannula.</b> The use of a distal-flow <b>cannula</b> for circulatory support might reduce the risk of distal limb ischemia...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cannula</b> {{design is}} of prime {{importance}} for venous drainage during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). To evaluate <b>cannulas</b> intended for CPB, an in vitro circuit {{was set up}} with silicone tubing between the test <b>cannula</b> encased in a movable preload reservoir and another static reservoir. The pressure-drop (DeltaP) value (P-drainage - P-preload) was measured using Millar pressure transducers. Flow rate (Q) was measured using an ultrasound flowmeter. Data display and data recording were controlled using a LabView application, custom made particularly for our experiments. Our results demonstrated that DeltaP, Q, and <b>cannula</b> resistance (DeltaP/Q) values were significantly decreased when the <b>cannula</b> diameter was increased for Smart and Medtronic <b>cannulas.</b> Smartcanula showed 36 % and 43 % less resistance compared to Medtronic venous and Medtronic femoral <b>cannulas,</b> respectively. The <b>cannula</b> shape (straight- or curved-tips) {{did not affect the}} DLP <b>cannula</b> resistance. Out of five <b>cannulas</b> tested, the Smartcanula outperforms the other commercially available <b>cannulas.</b> The mean (DeltaP/Q) values were 3. 3 +/- 0. 08, 4. 07 +/- 0. 08, 5. 58 +/- 0. 10, 5. 74 +/- 0. 15, and 6. 45 +/- 0. 15 for Smart, Medtronic, Edwards, Sarns, and Gambro <b>cannulas,</b> respectively (two-way ANOVA, p < 0. 0001). In conclusion, the present assay allows discrimination between different forms of <b>cannula</b> with high or low lumen resistance...|$|R
25|$|Depending on the patient, the cancer, {{the stage}} of cancer, the type of chemotherapy, and the dosage, {{intravenous}} chemotherapy may be given on either an inpatient or an outpatient basis. For continuous, frequent or prolonged intravenous chemotherapy administration, various systems may be surgically inserted into the vasculature to maintain access. Commonly used systems are the Hickman line, the Port-a-Cath, and the PICC line. These have a lower infection risk, are much less prone to phlebitis or extravasation, and {{eliminate the need for}} repeated insertion of peripheral <b>cannulae.</b>|$|E
500|$|Some species form {{aggregates}} or filaments {{of cells}} up to 200μm long. These organisms can be prominent in biofilms. Notably, aggregates of Thermococcus coalescens cells fuse together in culture, forming single giant cells. Archaea in the genus Pyrodictium produce an elaborate multicell colony involving arrays of long, thin hollow tubes called <b>cannulae</b> that stick {{out from the}} cells' surfaces and connect them into a dense bush-like agglomeration. The function of these <b>cannulae</b> is not settled, but they may allow communication or nutrient exchange with neighbors. Multi-species colonies exist, such as the [...] "string-of-pearls" [...] community that was discovered in 2001 in a German swamp. Round whitish colonies of a novel Euryarchaeota species are spaced along thin filaments that can range up to [...] long; these filaments are made of a particular bacteria species.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of [...] "on-pump" [...] surgery, the surgeon sutures <b>cannulae</b> into the heart and instructs the perfusionist to start {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass (CPB).

50|$|Twin <b>cannula</b> (assisted) liposuction (TCAL or TCL) uses a tube-within-a-tube {{specialized}} <b>cannula</b> pair, so {{that the}} <b>cannula</b> which aspirates fat, the mechanically reciprocated inner <b>cannula,</b> does not impact the patient's tissue or the surgeon's joints with each and every forward stroke. The aspirating inner <b>cannula</b> reciprocates within the slotted outer <b>cannula</b> to simulate a surgeon's stroke of up to 5 cm (2 in) rather than merely vibrating 1-2 mm (1/4 in) as other power assisted devices, removing most of the labor from the procedure. Superficial or subdermal liposuction is facilitated by the spacing effect of the outer <b>cannula</b> {{and the fact that}} the <b>cannulas</b> do not get hot, eliminating the potential for friction burns.|$|R
40|$|The tip {{structure}} of LVAD inflow <b>cannula</b> {{is one of}} major factors to lead adverse events such as thrombosis and suction leading to obstruction. In this research, four kinds of tips {{that had been used}} in inflow <b>cannulas</b> were selected and designed. The flow field of the four inflow <b>cannulas</b> inserted into the apex of left ventricle (LV) was numerically computed by computational fluid dynamics. The flow behavior was analyzed in order to compare the blood compatibility and suction in left ventricle and <b>cannulas</b> after the inflow <b>cannulas</b> with different tips were inserted to the apex of LV. The results showed that the <b>cannula</b> tip structure affected the LVAD performance. Among these four <b>cannulas,</b> the trumpet-tipped inflow <b>cannula</b> owned the best performance in smooth flow velocity distribution without backflow or low-velocity flow so that it was the best in blood compatibility. Nevertheless, the caged tipped <b>cannula</b> was the worst in blood compatibility. And the blunt-tipped and beveled tipped inflow <b>cannulas</b> may obstruct more easily than trumpet and caged tipped inflow <b>cannulas</b> because of their shape. The study indicated that the trumpet tip was the most preferable for the inflow <b>cannula</b> of long-term LVAD...|$|R
40|$|Background: Interplay {{between the}} {{components}} of a lipoplasty system (suction pump, suction tubing, collection canister, and <b>cannula)</b> determines liposuction efficiency. However, in clinical practice, none of the components {{are more important than}} the <b>cannula.</b> <b>Cannula</b> design including port design, port placement, and shaft characteristics is the single most influential contributor to flow resistance and dramatically effects speed of aspiration and final contour. Many variations on port design and placement are available, yet functional enhancements to the <b>cannula</b> shaft have largely been ignored. We have engineered a set of novel <b>cannulas</b> addressing vital elements of <b>cannula</b> design in the effort to enhance aspiration efficiency and efficacy. Methods: Two novel <b>cannula</b> designs (dual- and multiport, in-line configuration), created using a unique proprietary manufacturing process, were evaluated against a popular industry standard design (tri-port, Mercedes configuration) to assess aspiration efficiency. <b>Cannulas</b> with shaft diameters of 3, 4, and 5 mm were attached to a standardized lipoplasty system and evaluated in real time for their ability to aspirate a viscous applesauce medium over a 5 -minute time course. For each <b>cannula,</b> we calculated (1) the cross-sectional area of the <b>cannula</b> shaft, (2) single and total port area, (3) port-to-shaft ratio, and (4) theoretical resistance. Results: The relationship between the <b>cannula</b> shaft and <b>cannula</b> port(s) directly influenced flow dynamics. Comparing medium uptake time, aspiration efficiency and the aspiration curves demonstrated a significant improvement of the 2 novel <b>cannulas</b> over the standard <b>cannula</b> in the 5 - and 4 -mm designations. In the 3 -mm group, a difference in uptake time remained. However, a significant difference in aspiration efficiency was only seen between the dual-port novel <b>cannula</b> and tri-port Mercedes standard <b>cannula.</b> Further, differences in the aspiration curves between all 3 -mm <b>cannulas</b> approached but did not reach significance. Conclusions: We have developed 2 novel <b>cannulas</b> that maximize port features and seek to minimize the internal shaft resistance. Both designs demonstrate enhanced aspiration and uptake compared with an industry standard design...|$|R

40|$|Aims: Peripheral <b>cannulas</b> in newborns are {{commonly}} used for intravenous treatment. However sustained maintenance of <b>cannula</b> patency {{is often difficult to}} achieve in this age group. This study compares the duration for which <b>cannula</b> patency can be maintained in newborns under continuous infusion, or an intermittent flushing regimen, with normal saline. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted during a 12 -month period. All newborns admitted to the 16 -bed intermediate care unit, who required intravenous treatment, received either continuous peripheral infusion with 0. 9 % saline at an infusion rate of 2 mL/h or an intravenous <b>cannula,</b> which was flushed with 1 mL of 0. 9 % saline at least once every 24 h. Results: A total of 53 patients with 86 <b>cannulas</b> were included. Twenty-five (47 %) patients received 41 continuous infusions. The intermittent flushing group consisted of 28 (53 %) patients with 45 <b>cannulas</b> administered. The <b>cannula</b> patency was significantly longer in the intermittent flushing group (mean 62. 1 vs. 92. 8 h, P= 0. 01). The patient's underlying disease and the <b>cannula</b> insertion site were not related with the duration of the <b>cannula</b> patency.
