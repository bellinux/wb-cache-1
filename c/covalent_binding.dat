25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of these drugs derives from two factors: their target, the H+/K+ ATPase {{which is responsible for}} the last step in acid secretion; therefore, their action on acid secretion is independent of the stimulus to acid secretion, of histamine, acetylcholine, or other yet to be discovered stimulants. Also, their mechanism of action involves <b>covalent</b> <b>binding</b> of the activated drug to the enzyme, resulting in a duration of action that exceeds their plasma half-life.|$|E

25|$|Nitrazepam {{has been}} {{associated}} with severe hepatic disorders, similar to other nitrobenzodiazepines. Nitrobenzodiazepines such as nitrazepam, nimetazepam, flunitrazepam, and clonazepam are more toxic to the liver than other benzodiazepines as they are metabolically activated by CYP3A4 which can result in cytotoxicity. This activation can lead to the generation of free radicals and oxidation of thiol, as well as <b>covalent</b> <b>binding</b> with endogenous macromolecules; this results, then, in oxidation of cellular components or inhibition of normal cellular function. Metabolism of a nontoxic drug to reactive metabolites has been causally connected with a variety of adverse reactions.|$|E

The ultimate objective is to assess the toxic effects of a chemical in laboratory animals and extrapolate the pertinent experimental data to man. To accomplish these objectives, one must consider the main factors which may influence and modulate the toxic effects of chemicals in the organ.

30|$|Compared to {{synthetic}} polymers, proteins possess several advantages: They {{might be}} degraded into the peptides by naturally occurring enzymes; {{in comparison with}} the chemically synthesized nanomolecules, they may accumulate in the body and result in toxic degradation products [11]. Electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic attractions, and <b>covalent</b> <b>bindings</b> are the mechanisms allowing attaching the drug with the carrier. Also, these nanoparticles are able to be modified and present the attached molecules {{to the surface of the}} targeted cells [11]. It was demonstrated that uptake of albumin–paclitaxel nanoparticles is presumably mediated by the gp 60 transcytosis pathway and subsequent binding to secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) in the tumor extracellular matrix [12].|$|R
25|$|Forty {{years after}} the {{publication}} of Manfred Eigen's primary work dedicated to hypercycles, Nilesh Vaidya and colleagues showed experimentally that ribozymes can form catalytic cycles and networks capable of expanding their sizes by incorporating new members. However, this is not a demonstration of a hypercycle in accordance with its definition, but an example of a collectively autocatalytic set. Earlier computer simulations showed that molecular networks can arise, evolve and be resistant to parasitic RNA branches. In their experiments, Vaidya et al. used an Azoarcus group I intron ribozyme that, when fragmented, has an ability to self-assemble by catalysing recombination reactions in an autocatalytic manner. They mutated the three-nucleotide-long sequences responsible for recognition of target sequences on {{the opposite end of the}} ribozyme (namely, Internal Guide Sequences or IGSs) as well as these target sequences. Some genotypes could introduce cooperation by recognizing target sequences of the other ribozymes, promoting their <b>covalent</b> <b>binding,</b> while other selfish genotypes were only able to self-assemble. In separation, the selfish subsystem grew faster than the cooperative one. After mixing selfish ribozymes with cooperative ones, the emergence of cooperative behaviour in a merged population was observed, outperforming the self-assembling subsystems. Moreover, the selfish ribozymes were integrated into the network of reactions, supporting its growth. These results were also explained analytically by the ODE model and its analysis. They differ substantially from results obtained in evolutionary dynamics. According to evolutionary dynamics theory, selfish molecules should dominate the system even if the growth rate of the selfish subsystem in isolation is lower than the growth rate of the cooperative system. Moreover, Vaidya et al. proved that, when fragmented into more pieces, ribozymes that are capable of self-assembly can not only still form catalytic cycles but, indeed, favour them. Results obtained from experiments by Vaidya et al. gave a glimpse on how inefficient prebiotic polymerases, capable of synthesizing only short oligomers, could be sufficient at the pre-life stage to spark off life. This could happen because coupling the synthesis of short RNA fragments by the first ribozymal polymerases to a system capable of self-assembly not only enables building longer sequences but also allows exploiting the fitness space more efficiently with the use of the recombination process. Another experiment performed by Hannes Mutschler et al. showed that the RNA polymerase ribozyme, which they described, can be synthesized in situ from the ligation of four smaller fragments, akin to a recombination of Azoarcus ribozyme from four inactive oligonucleotide fragments described earlier. Apart from a substantial contribution of the above experiments to the research on the origin of life, they have not proven the existence of hypercycles experimentally.|$|E

The ultimate objective is to assess the toxic effects of a chemical in laboratory animals and extrapolate the pertinent experimental data to man. To accomplish these objectives, one must consider the main factors which may influence and modulate the toxic effects of chemicals in the organ. In the male gonads, such modifying factors are the pharmaco-kinetic parameters governing the absorption, distribution, activation and detoxification of indirect car-cinogens, <b>covalent</b> <b>bindings</b> to macromolecules, and DNA damage as well as DNA repair of damaged germ cells. All of these factors have been presently studied in our laboratory and are discussed in this paper {{with the exception of}} <b>covalent</b> <b>bindings</b> to macromolecules. The pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the functional blood-testis barrier (BTB) closely re-sembles the blood-brain barrier in transport characteristics: the permeability of nonelectrolytes and the acidic drugs with pK,, values depend upon their molecular size and their partition coefficients, respec-tively. Thus, the functional BTB, restricts the permeability of many foreign compounds to male germ cells. Studies of mixed function oxidases and cytochrome P- 450 system in male gonads demonstrated that the presence of AHH, EH, and GSH-ST implicate activation and detoxification of polycyclic hy-drocarbons. Thus, active electrophiles may exert significant toxic effects locally within both interstitial and germ cell compartments. The presence of an efficient DNA repair system in premeiotic spermatogenic cells (and not in spermiogenic cells) can further modify both toxic and mutagenic events in the subsequent differentiation of germ cells to mature spermatozoa...|$|R
40|$|A chemoenzymatic {{strategy}} has been exploited to make covalently linked alginate beads with high stability. This was achieved by grafting mannuronan (alginate with 100 % mannuronic acid (M)) with methacrylate moieties and then performing two enzymatic steps converting M to guluronic acid (G) in alternating sequences (MG-blocks) and in G-blocks. In this way a methacrylate grafted alginate with better gel-forming ability was achieved. <b>Covalent</b> <b>bindings</b> were introduced into the beads by using a photoinitiating system that initiated polymerization of the methacrylate moieties. The covalent links were demonstrated by beads remaining intact after treatment with EDTA. The new chemoenzymatic photocrosslinked (CEPC) beads were compatible with cells with low post-encapsulation ability like C 2 C 12 myoblasts and human pancreatic islets. The islets continued secreting insulin after encapsulation. On contrary, cells with a high post-encapsulation proliferative ability like 293 -endo cells died within 2 -week post-encapsulation. The exceptional stability and the cell compatibility of the new CEPC beads make them interesting as bioreactors for delivering therapeutic proteins in future applications...|$|R

This is the discovered AaO-mechanism, which has the power to capture synthesis through emerging AaO-rings. Further, the transcription through the Functional Clause (FC) provides the foundation for their differentiation and decides on the trend in the governing messengers. A precisely definable number of messengers is steering and controlling the algorithmic working of this mechanism. In focusing on angular articulation, it will be demonstrated that different magnitudes (measured in radians) constitute the expression of an articulation in FC. It is shown that the function of radians allow the demonstration of value integration. Moreover, directional rotation in the messengers is essential. Furthermore, through proper localisation of the corresponding function-value integrations, it will be demonstrated that changing AaO-states are producing <b>covalent</b> <b>bindings,</b> which restrict the number of possible angular positions to very few.
