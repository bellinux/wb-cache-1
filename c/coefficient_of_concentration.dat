Knowledge of induced stress {{is very important for}} accurate design of adjacent gateroads and intervening pillars which helps to raise the safety and productivity of longwall mining operations. This study presents a novel time-dependent analytical model for determination of the longwall mining-induced stress and investigates the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> stress <b>concentration</b> over adjacent gates and pillars. The model is developed based on the strain energy balance in longwall mining incorporated to a rheological constitutive model of caved materials with time-varying parameters. The study site is the Tabas coal mine of Iran. In the proposed model, height of destressed zone above the mined panel, total longwall mining-induced stress, abutment angle, induced vertical stress, and <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> stress <b>concentration</b> over neighboring gates and intervening pillars are calculated.

This article {{is an attempt to}} investigate regional income inequality and the convergence dynamics in Turkey for the time period 1987 - 2001. First, the Theil <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentration</b> index is used to analyze the dispersion aspects of the convergence process. The geographically based decomposition of inequality suggests a strong correlation between the share of interregional inequality and spatial clustering. Then, we estimate convergence dynamics employing alternative spatial econometric methods. In addition to the global models, we also estimate local models taking spatial variations into account. Empirical analysis indicates that geographically weighted regression improves model fitting with better explanatory power. There is considerable variation in speed of convergence of provinces, which cannot be captured by the traditional beta convergence analysis. © 2009 Sage Publications...|$|E

Multivariate factor analysis confirms two main common components of efficient retail electricity supply and satisfaction of consumers in industry. In the first group of factors of efficient retail electricity supply the highest weights are for consumption, quality of services, expenses and advice. In the second group of factors of consumers’ satisfaction the highest weights are for response, needs, reliability and personnel.

Regional convergence of per capita GDP in Italy is analyzed for the period 1953 - 1993 using the Theil <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentration</b> and a relationship with the process of national economic development is postulated. Two different phases are distinguished, with 1975 serving as a break-point.

The general conclusion is that after a period of strong convergence, which was limited to the years 1960 - 1975, the process of regional convergence stopped in Italy and since then a long-term tendency towards divergence has been verified. Both the process of national development and spatial factors are shown to have {{played an important role in}} the convergence process, suggesting that the identification of appropriate temporal and spatial disaggregation is a necessary condition in order to understand the regional growth process. ...|$|E
