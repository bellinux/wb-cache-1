5|$|Like most {{legislation}} of its kind, {{the act of}} 1893 {{imposed a}} time limit for the <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> of land and the raising of capital. To keep the powers granted by the act alive, the CCE submitted a series of further bills to Parliament for extensions of time. Extensions were granted by the Charing Cross Euston and Hampstead Railway Acts, 1897, 1898, 1900, and 1902.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the Cornerstone article, English Heritage stepped in to begin legal proceedings that would lead to the <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> of the barn. It carried out emergency repairs of the barn in November 2009, without the owners' consent, under an Urgent Works Notice. The agency carried out an unusual legal manoeuvre to speed up the works, declassifying the barn from a scheduled monument to a Grade I listed building. This enabled the notice to be issued more speedily, overriding the owners' objections.|$|E
5|$|In 1900 Liverpool Corporation {{attempted}} {{to acquire the}} entire area to safeguard its water supply, and proposed demolishing the entire village. The Act of Parliament known as the Liverpool Corporation Act 1902 protected some buildings but others were left vulnerable. The Act allowed the corporation to acquire by <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> properties in {{the west of the}} village, including the Black-a-Moors Head public house (known locally as the 'Black Lad') and New Hall, which were demolished between 1902 and 1905. The result was the small settlement that has remained largely unchanged since then.|$|E

5|$|Like most {{legislation}} of its kind, {{the act of}} 1893 {{imposed a}} time limit for the <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> of land and the raising of capital. To keep the powers alive, the BS announced a new bill in November 1895, which included an application for an extension of time. The additional time and permission to raise an extra £100,000 of capital was granted when the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1896 received royal assent on 7 August 1896.|$|E
5|$|On 16 November 1914, {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of war, the DR gave notice of another bill which sought a further extension of time for land purchases. The DR was also to stand guarantor for the W and to lease the W's undertakings, in effect taking over the W This was granted under the Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1915 on 24 June 1915. War-time restrictions prevented any construction and so extensions to the earlier acts were granted each year from 1918 to 1922 to give a final date of 26 July 1924 for completion of the <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 1912, {{both the}} W and the DR {{published}} notices that further bills would {{be submitted to}} extend the time limit imposed by the 1910 Act for the <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> of the land needed for the railway, to enable the W to raise additional capital, and to give the DR powers {{to take over the}} W The DR bill contained provisions to increase the capacity on the DR-owned section of the Wimbledon branch, by constructing further additional tracks from south of Parsons Green to south of Walham Green station (now Fulham Broadway).|$|E

50|$|The channel {{involved}} complex {{civil engineering}} {{to deal with}} utility conduits, roads and railways, as well as ecological and social issues, entailing <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchases,</b> community lectures and consultations and a public enquiry.

50|$|The UFU {{has been}} {{involved}} in a number of campaigns for farmers' rights in Northern Ireland, including opposing moves to introduce <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchases</b> of farmland for industrial purposes, organising a protest over low produce prices and campaigning for an exemption for beef export bans during the Bovine spongiform encephalopathy crises.|$|R
5|$|The North West Development Agency used a <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> {{order to}} take control of the main site in 2003. This allowed the Heritage Lottery Fund to give a £7.164M grant towards the {{restoration}} of the complex. Together with an additional grant from the North West Development Agency, a £10M regeneration project took place between 2004 and 2006. The project included repair and strengthening of the structure, the restoration of the canal basin, a new roof and windows, and the reinstatement of two missing floors from the Murray Street block.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was {{the headquarters of}} the Manchester Fire Brigade until the brigade was replaced by the Greater Manchester Fire Service in 1974. The fire station closed in 1986, since when it has been largely unused despite several redevelopment proposals. It was placed on English Heritage's Buildings at Risk Register in 2001 and in 2010 Manchester City Council served a <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> order on the fire station's owner, Britannia Hotels. Britannia announced in 2015 their intention to sell the building opening up the possibility of redevelopment after nearly 30 years of dereliction.|$|E
5|$|The main {{provisions}} of the Act were focused upon allowing the Commonwealth to enact legislation that was required for the smooth prosecution of the war. The main areas in which legislation was enacted under the War Precautions Act were: the prevention of trade with hostile nations, the creation of loans {{to raise money for}} the war effort, the introduction of a national taxation scheme, the fixing of the prices of certain goods, the internment of people considered a danger to the war effort, the <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> of strategic goods, and the censorship of the media.|$|E
500|$|The {{uncertainty}} {{over the future}} of the North Circular Road has blighted properties on and near it, particularly around Bounds Green. Around 1972, approximately 400 homes on the road were <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchased</b> by the Greater London Council in conjunction with widening schemes that were then cancelled. The properties have suffered from a lack of long-term care. [...] Since TfL took responsibility for the road, land for future schemes has been left dormant, resulting in urban decay with derelict properties. <b>Compulsory</b> <b>purchased</b> properties were let out to various short-term tenants, which led to them housing prostitutes and migrant workers living in increasing squalor. Pedestrians have become too frightened to use underpasses along the road, particularly to access North Middlesex Hospital. Areas close to the road, such as the alleys behind properties on the Telford Road section, have suffered from fly tipping and anti-social behaviour.|$|R
25|$|In February 2010, Crossrail {{was accused}} of {{bullying}} residents whose property lay on the route into selling {{for less than the}} market value. A subsequent London Assembly report was highly critical of the insensitive way in which Crossrail had dealt with <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchases</b> and the lack of assistance given to the people and businesses affected.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Common {{was bought}} by the Corporation of London in 1883. At that time, it encompassed some of the area that is now Kenley Airfield. Over the years, <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchases</b> by the Government and subsequent land acquisitions and re-acquisitions have meant that the Common has changed its shape and position, and almost doubled in size.|$|R
5|$|With {{the funds}} {{available}} from the UERL and the route decided, the CCE started site demolitions and preparatory works in July 1902. On 21 November 1902, the CCE published another bill which sought <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> powers for additional buildings for its station sites, planned the take-over of the E and abandoned the permitted but redundant section of the line from Kentish Town to the proposed depot site near Highgate Road. This bill was approved as the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway Act, 1903 on 21 July 1903.|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s, {{planning}} blight {{had affected}} {{the area and}} many of the houses had become home to a community of artists and squatters. Eventually, contractors were appointed to carry out the work and a <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> of property along the proposed route was undertaken. In March 1993, in preparation for the construction of the road, the Earl of Caithness, then the Minister of State for Transport, estimated that there would be 263 properties scheduled for demolition, displacing 550 people, of which he estimated 172 were seeking rehousing. Several original residents, who had in some cases lived in their homes all their lives, refused to sell or move out of their properties.|$|E
5|$|The club {{succeeded in}} a further legal {{challenge}} bought by small firms in January 2005 as the High Court upheld {{a decision by}} then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott to grant a <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> order {{in support of the}} scheme. The stadium later became issue in the local elections in May 2006. The Metropolitan Police restricted supporters' coaches to being parked in the nearby Sobel Sports Centre rather than in the underground stadium car park, and restricted access to 14 streets on match days. These police restrictions were conditions of the stadiums' health and safety certificate which the stadium requires to operate and open. The road closures were passed at a council meeting in July 2005.|$|E
500|$|The {{block of}} {{properties}} at No.295–297 Pentonville Road, at its junction with Gray's Inn Road, {{is known as}} the [...] "Lighthouse Block" [...] owing to the lead clad tower {{at the top of the}} building. The site avoided being <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchased</b> and demolished (in order to provide improvements to King's Cross station's eastern entrance) and is now Grade II listed.|$|R
50|$|HMS Dalriada was {{established}} as a Royal Naval Reserve Headquarters Unit for Greenock and the Firth of Clyde, Scotland in 1965 and originally occupied buildings in Inverkip. Dalriada remained in Inverkip until 1982, when the unit moved to the Navy Buildings in Greenock, {{on the site of}} the former Royal Navy Torpedo Factory (RNTF) which had been <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchased</b> by the Admiralty in 1907.|$|R
50|$|Rochester City Council <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchased</b> {{the land}} at Rochester Airfield in September 1933 from the {{landowner}} {{as the site}} for a municipal airport. One month later Short Brothers, who had started building aircraft in 1909 on the Isle of Sheppey, asked for permission to lease the land for test flying and thus began the privileged relationship between the local authority and the aviation industry.|$|R
5|$|An error as to a {{precedent}} fact, if committed, deprives the public authority {{of power to}} take the action or make the decision in question. The existence or non-existence of the fact, {{as the case may}} be, is a condition precedent or prerequisite to the exercise of the power. An example of an error of this nature {{can be found in the}} United Kingdom case White & Collins v. Minister of Health (1939). In that case, under the relevant statute, the authority could only issue a <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> order affecting the applicants' land if it was not part of, among other things, a park. A minister confirmed the purchase order but the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that it should be quashed, finding that the minister could not exercise power to acquire the land since it was part of a park. Whether the land was or was not a park was {{a precedent}} fact, and the minister had committed an error concerning this fact.|$|E
5|$|Like most {{legislation}} of its kind, {{the act of}} 1891 {{imposed a}} time limit for the <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> of land and the raising of capital. The original date specified for completion of construction {{was the end of}} 1896, but the time required to raise the finance and purchase station sites meant that construction had not begun by the start of that year. To give itself extra time, the CLR had obtained an extension of time to 1899 by the Central London Railway Act, 1894. Construction works were let by the ETCL as three sub-contracts: Shepherd's Bush to Marble Arch, Marble Arch to St Martin's Le Grand and St Martin's Le Grand to Bank. Work began with demolition of buildings at the Chancery Lane site in April 1896 and construction shafts were started at Chancery Lane, Shepherd's Bush, Stanhope Terrace and Bloomsbury in August and September 1896.|$|E
5|$|On 28 August 1827, {{the canal}} company {{announced}} that they were taking over the River Tone Navigation, {{under the terms of}} their acts of parliament of 1811 and 1824. This they did in November, when William Goodland, the river superintendent, was evicted from his cottage, the tolls were raised again, and maintenance ceased. This action was ruled to be illegal by the Court of King's Bench, as the canal company had not complied with the time limits enshrined in the act, but the canal company held on to the river despite the order to give it back to the conservators. Both sides took their case to the High Court, which ruled that the Conservators should have the river in February 1830. A further series of legal actions followed, after which the canal company attempted to obtain a new act of parliament to obtain the Tone by <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase.</b> The Conservators then decided to negotiate, and an act of parliament passed in July 1832 authorised the takeover.|$|E
5000|$|The {{legacy of}} the {{proposals}} still exists in terms of land that was <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchased</b> by the Corporation at the time; for example the old College Goods Yard (part of the City of Glasgow Union Railway) was acquired and for 40 years {{was used as an}} open air car park - it was only recently built upon in 2011 by the Glasgow Collegelands office development.|$|R
25|$|Apart from {{progressive}} taxation on each household's harvest, the state introduced {{a system of}} <b>compulsory</b> state <b>purchases</b> of grain at fixed prices to build up stockpiles for famine-relief and meet the terms of its trade agreements with the Soviet Union. Together, taxation and <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchases</b> accounted for 30 percent of the harvest by 1957, leaving very little surplus. Rationing was also introduced in the cities to curb 'wasteful consumption' and encourage savings (which were deposited in state-owned banks and thus became available for investment), and although food could be purchased from state-owned retailers the market price was higher than that for which it had been purchased. This too {{was done in the}} name of discouraging excessive consumption.|$|R
50|$|During {{his years}} in Parliament, Davies sat on {{committees}} investigating land reform, the jury system, reform of the electoral system, <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchases</b> by local authorities, and reform of the House of Lords. He returned to Parliament as MP for Denbigh in 1923, but resigned in 1929 on grounds of ill health. In 1932, he was prominent in the discussions of the Presbyterian Church of Wales on formulating a parliamentary bill relating to the church.|$|R
5|$|A plan {{to upgrade}} the {{waterways}} to allow the use of 300 to 500-tonne boats {{led to the formation}} of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Canal Company Limited in November 1888. The cost of the scheme was estimated to be around £1million, in addition to the cost of acquiring the canals from the railway company. The new company obtained an Act of Parliament on 26 August 1889, creating the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company, which was authorised to raise £1.5million and to purchase the four canals either by negotiation, or by <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> if negotiations failed. The railway company was unwilling to sell, and it was not until 1895, after protracted negotiation and legal battles that the transfer was agreed. The Navigation Company had only succeeded in raising £625,000, which was less than the purchase price of the canals, and therefore the railway company nominated half of the ten directors, while the Aire and Calder Company declined to buy any shares because of railway influence. Many of the ambitious plans for the modernisation of the system were hindered by a lack of capital, although some further developments took place.|$|E
5|$|After {{establishing}} a legal {{career in the}} field of insolvency, Stevenson served during the Second World War as a Deputy Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces. He was subsequently Judge Advocate at the 1945 war crimes trial of former personnel of the German submarine U-852 for their actions in {{what became known as the}} Peleus affair. In 1954 Stevenson represented the government of British Kenya during Jomo Kenyatta's unsuccessful appeal against his conviction for membership of the rebel organisation Mau Mau. Later that year he represented the litigants in the Crichel Down affair, which led to changes in the law on <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase.</b> In 1955 he defended Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be executed for murder in the United Kingdom, and two years later took part in the unsuccessful prosecution of suspected serial killer John Bodkin Adams. He was deeply distressed by the execution of Ellis, for whom there had been no defence in law, but who was expected to have been reprieved by Home Secretary Gwilym Lloyd George.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Livingstone and {{his comrades}} {{developed}} a new strategy for obtaining political power in Lambeth borough. Focusing on campaigning for the marginal seats {{in the south of}} the borough, the safe Labour seats in the north were left to established party members. Public dissatisfaction with the Conservative government of Prime Minister Edward Heath led to Labour's best local government results since the 1940s; Labour leftists gained every marginal seat in Lambeth, and the borough returned to Labour control. In October 1971, Livingstone's father died of a heart attack; his mother soon moved to Lincoln. That year, Labour members voted Livingstone Vice-Chairman of the Housing Committee on the Lambeth London Borough Council, his first job in local government. Reforming the housing system, Livingstone and Committee Chairman Ewan Carr cancelled the proposed rent increase for council housing, temporarily halting the construction of Europe's largest tower blocks, and founded a Family Squatting Group to ensure that homeless families would be immediately rehoused through squatting in empty houses. He increased the number of <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchase</b> orders for private-rented properties, converting them to council housing. They faced opposition to their reforms, which were cancelled by central government.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s, communes were {{established}} in rural areas and the government imposed ‘procurement planning’, which required peasants to deliver {{a certain amount of}} food to the state at state-imposed prices. However demand exceeded supply and the agricultural sector produced very inefficiently. The government tried to solve this problem by introducing a grain rationing system, combining consumer rationing and <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchases</b> from producers.The gradual development of a free market {{put an end to the}} rationing system and introduced dual prices. This is where the price-scissors phenomena emerged.|$|R
5|$|Recognising their {{financial}} predicament, the LNC lobbied Parliament {{for a new}} Act of Parliament to allow the venture to survive. On 23 July 1855 the London Necropolis & National Mausoleum Amendment Act 1855 received Royal Assent. This Act released the LNC from those <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchases</b> of land which had been mandated by the 1852 Act but {{had not yet been}} completed, easing the immediate financial burden. It also allowed a ten-year window for the LNC to sell certain parts of the land bought from Lord Onslow which were not required for the cemetery, to provide a source of income.|$|R
5|$|No {{immediate}} {{effort was}} made to start the works and they were postponed indefinitely when World War I started. With wartime restrictions in place, construction work for the railway was prevented. Yearly extensions to the earlier E acts were granted under special wartime powers each year from 1916 until 1922, giving a final date by which <b>compulsory</b> <b>purchases</b> had to be made of 7 August 1924. Although the permissions had been maintained, the UERL could not raise the money needed for the works. Construction costs had increased considerably during the war years and the returns produced by the company could not cover the cost of repaying loans.|$|R
