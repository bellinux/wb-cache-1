25|$|Emergency {{sanitation}} {{is required}} in situations including natural disasters and relief for refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). There are three phases: Immediate, short term and long term. In the immediate phase, {{the focus is on}} managing open defecation, and toilet technologies might include very basic latrines, pit latrines, bucket toilets, container-based toilets, <b>chemical</b> <b>toilets.</b> The short term phase might also involve technologies such as urine-diverting dry toilets, septic tanks, decentralized wastewater systems. Providing handwashing facilities and management of fecal sludge are also part of emergency sanitation. The Sphere Project handbook provides protection principles and core standards for sanitation to put in place after a disaster or conflict.|$|E

50|$|A <b>chemical</b> <b>toilet</b> {{collects}} {{human excreta}} {{in a holding}} tank and uses chemicals to minimize odors. These toilets are usually, but not always, self-contained and movable. A <b>chemical</b> <b>toilet</b> is structured around a relatively small tank, which needs to be emptied frequently. It is not connected to {{a hole in the}} ground (like a pit latrine), nor to a septic tank, nor is it plumbed into a municipal system leading to a sewage treatment plant. When the tank is emptied, the contents are usually pumped into a sanitary sewer or directly to a treatment plant.|$|R

2500|$|According to Statistics South Africa, {{access is}} higher, {{partially}} because it includes shared facilities in its definition of sanitation.

The health impacts of inadequate saniation can be serious, {{as evidenced by the}} estimated 1.5 million cases of diarrhoea in children under five and the 2001 outbreak of cholera. While most coliforms are harmless to human health, the presence of E. coli , which covers approximately 97% of coliform bacteria found in the intestines of animals and in faeces, underlines the presence of more harmful pathogens in the water system (DWAF 1996b).|$|E

The Aldwych branch of the Piccadilly line was closed to trains, tracks were concreted over, and reinforced floodgates were installed that could be closed instantly in case of burst river embankments due to bomb damage. Seventy-nine stations were fitted with bunks for 22,000 people, supplied with first aid facilities and equipped with <b>chemical</b> <b>toilets.</b> 124 canteens opened {{in all parts of the}} tube system.
