5|$|The {{standard}} {{word order}} is, {{as in most}} Germanic languages, V2, {{which means that the}} finite verb (V) appears in second position (2) of a declarative main clause. Swedish morphology is similar to English; that is, words have comparatively few inflections. There are two genders, no grammatical cases (except for pronouns), and a distinction between plural and singular. Older analyses posit the cases nominative and genitive and there are some remains of distinct accusative and dative forms as well. Adjectives are <b>compared</b> <b>as</b> in English, and are also inflected according to gender, number and definiteness. The definiteness of nouns is marked primarily through suffixes (endings), complemented with separate definite and indefinite articles. The prosody features both stress and in most dialects tonal qualities. The language has a comparatively large vowel inventory. Swedish is also notable for the voiceless dorso-palatal velar fricative, a highly variable consonant phoneme.|$|E

25|$|An {{examination}} of Y-chromosome variation, sampled in an east–west transect across England and Wales, was compared with similar samples taken in Friesland and Norway.

Samples from Norway were also <b>compared,</b> <b>as</b> this is a source of the later Viking migrations.

25|$|The United States {{is home to}} {{a number}} of {{perceptions}} about Canadian culture, due to the countries' partially shared heritage and the relatively large number of cultural features common to both the US and Canada. For example, the average Canadian may be perceived as more reserved than his or her American counterpart. Canada and the United States are often inevitably <b>compared</b> <b>as</b> sibling countries, and the perceptions that arise from this oft-held contrast have gone to shape the advertised worldwide identities of both nations: the United States is seen as the rebellious child of the British Crown, forged in the fires of violent revolution; Canada is the calmer offspring of the United Kingdom, known for a more relaxed national demeanour.|$|E

25|$|Under this assumption, one may {{omit the}} first row and write the {{permutation}} in one-line notation as , that is, an ordered arrangement of S. Care {{must be taken to}} distinguish one-line notation from the cycle notation described later. In mathematics literature, a common usage is to omit parentheses for one-line notation, while using them for cycle notation. The one-line notation is also called the word representation of a permutation. The example above would then be 2 5 4 3 1 since the natural order 1 2 3 4 5 would be assumed for {{the first row}}. (It is typical to use commas to separate these entries only if some have two or more digits.) This form is more compact, and is common in elementary combinatorics and computer science. It is especially useful in applications where the elements of S or the permutations are to be <b>compared</b> <b>as</b> larger or smaller.|$|E

The daughter of goalkeeper Moacir Barbosa, who was scapegoated for the 1950 defeat, said the loss was enough to redeem her father's legacy, while Uruguayan striker Alcides Ghiggia, responsible for the Cup-winning goal of the Maracanazo, felt that though both games were traumatic they could not be <b>compared</b> <b>as</b> the 1950 match had more at stake. Following the match, German fans were escorted out of the stadium by police and police were put on alert for possible riots.
