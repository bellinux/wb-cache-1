It acts as a corrective action for customers if they feel disappointed if the product or service didn’t meet their expectation.

Some of the important aspects of effective <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> are responsiveness, accessibility, and high visibility. Company X is a market leader in its industry. It is important for a high rank company like Company X to have effective <b>complaint</b> <b>handling.</b> However, although their <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> is already advanced and effective in most of the aspects, there is still problem in here and there. The main problem of their <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> is the speed of <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> process or duration. It causes post-complaint handling dissatisfaction. To overcome with this weakness, Company X should have improvement in its internal coordination to make the process faster. They also have to be more visible to customers related to its <b>complaint</b> <b>handling.</b> For example provide FAQ in company website or detail about the procedure of <b>complaint</b> <b>handling.</b> The ineffectiveness may not impact directly to customer retention in the short-term as their <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> is already effective.

The management of <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> is regarded as a crucial contributor to its business performance. To identify key factors that influence the efficiency of <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> in manufacturing industry, it is important to start with an investigation of a company's internal <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> management. A multiple case study has been carried out in the form of semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with managers from six different manufacturing companies. The studyreveals that four factors in <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> are to be paid attention to, which include <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> process, qualified <b>complaint</b> handler, <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> system and <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> policy. By comparing the companies' viewpoints as well as theoretical perspective on these factors, some differences and similarities are revealed. Finally, the study found that the complaint handler who possesses the adequate technical knowledge of the product and interpersonal skills is the most essential factor that affects complaint-handling efficiency.

40|$|Many {{companies}} consider {{investments in}} <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> as means of increasing customer commitment and building customer loyalty. Firms {{are not well}} informed, however, {{on how to deal}} successfully with service failures or the impact of <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> strategies. In this study, the authors find that a majority of complaining customers were dissatisfied with recent <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> experiences. Using justice theory, the authors also demonstrate that customers evaluate complaint incidents in terms of the outcomes they receive, the procedures used to arrive at the outcomes, {{and the nature of the}} interpersonal treatment during the process. In turn, the authors develop and test competing hypotheses regarding the interplay between satisfaction with <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> and prior experi-ence in shaping customer trust and commitment. The results support a quasi "brand equity " perspective—whereas satisfaction with <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> has a direct impact on trust and commitment, prior positive experiences miti-gate, to a limited extent, the effects of poor <b>complaint</b> <b>handling.</b> Implications for managers and scholars are discussed. Considerable evidence indicates tbat recovering effec-tively from service failures contributes to customerevaluations of firtns.

However, while prior research emphasizes the general relevance of <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> design, {{it fails to}} provide a more differentiated perspective on this interesting issue. This study, which is based on an integrative multi-level framework and a dyadic dataset, addresses this important gap in research. Results indicate that the impact of a company’s <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> design varies significantly depending on the characteristics of the complaining customers with which the firm has to deal. Further, this paper shows that, contingent on these characteristics, a company’s <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> design can shape complainants’ fairness perceptions either considerably or only slightly. Overall, findings suggest that companies should apply an adaptive approach to <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> to avoid misallocation of attention, energy, and resources...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a {{conceptual}} model for ethical and fair <b>complaint</b> <b>handling.</b> This provides a basis for research and the development of financial institution <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> approaches and practices. Design/methodology/approach – Ethical issues posed by the application of fairness theory to <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> are explored. The ethical soundness of organizational justice theory is critiqued. Multi-disciplinary literature is drawn on to develop a conceptual model for ethical fairness in <b>complaint</b> <b>handling.</b> Findings – Issues relevant to an ethical approach to <b>complaint</b> <b>handling,</b> and which are underdeveloped in current organizational and perceived justice frameworks, are identified. These include issues of autonomy, context, reflexivity, moral value, stakeholder voice, power and moral accountability. A conceptual model for ethical fairness in <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> is proposed. Research limitations/implications – This paper establishes a research agenda. Further development is required. Practical implications – The proposed model contributes to the development of <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> practices and competency frameworks. Originality/value – Justice theories have been proposed as theoretical frameworks for service recovery procedures, however, moral and critical questions have been neglected. The model proposed challenges financial institutions to move away from traditional normative perspectives, which seek to solve problems through managerial interventions, and adopt a perspective which is interpretivistic and reflexive. The model recognizes ethical issues and seeks to minimize inherent power positions, identify accountability and question moral values. Through envisioning complaint handlers as boundary spanners, new light is shed on their relational and communicative roles...|$|R

The building of consumer trust was sensitive to perceptions of justice regarding the way <b>complaints</b> were <b>handled</b> by the company. More specifically, the perception of interactional fairness strongly impacted consumer trust in the employees which, in turn, revealed a high impact on trust in the company. Insofar as satisfaction with <b>complaint</b> <b>handling</b> does not mediate the relationship between the dimensions of fairness and trust, following a conflict it loses part of its importance.
