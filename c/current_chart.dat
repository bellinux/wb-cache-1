25|$|Starting in 1968 and {{carrying}} {{on through the}} 1970s a rival series of Top of the Pops albums were produced, however these had no connection with the television series except for its name. They were a series of budget cover albums of <b>current</b> <b>chart</b> hits recorded by anonymous session singers and musicians released on the Hallmark record label. They had initially reached the charts but were later disallowed due {{to a change in}} the criteria for entering the charts. These albums continued to be produced until the early 1980s, when the advent of compilation albums featuring the original versions of hits, such as the Now That's What I Call Music! series, led to a steep decline in their popularity.|$|E
500|$|A fellow student, John Ashcroft, {{introduced}} Harry to rock 'n' roll records, and {{the members}} of Rory Storm & the Hurricanes and Cass & the Cassanovas. Harry carried notebooks with him, collecting information about the local groups, once writing to the Daily Mail: [...] "Liverpool is like New Orleans {{at the turn of the}} century, but with rock 'n' roll instead of jazz". He also wrote to the Liverpool Echo about the emerging Liverpool music scene, but neither paper was interested in stories about music that was popular with teenagers. The classified ads in the Liverpool Echo for local groups were always under the heading of Jazz, but the paper refused to change this policy, despite pleas from the promoters and groups who actually paid for them. Harry planned to produce a jazz newspaper called Storyville/52nd Street and contacted Sam Leach, the owner of a club called Storyville. Leach promised to fund the newspaper, but failed to turn up for three meetings with Harry, leaving him no other option but to find another investor. Harry thought starting a fortnightly newspaper covering Liverpool's rock 'n' roll music scene would be more successful, and would differ from national music newspapers such as the New Musical Express and the Melody Maker, which only wrote articles about <b>current</b> <b>chart</b> hits and artists.|$|E
2500|$|Gilmour {{travelled}} to France in mid-1967 with Rick Wills and Willie Wilson, {{formerly of}} Jokers Wild. The trio performed under the band name Flowers, then Bullitt, {{but they were}} not commercially successful. After hearing their uninspired covers of <b>current</b> <b>chart</b> hits, club owners were reluctant to pay them, and soon after their arrival in Paris, thieves stole their equipment. While in France, Gilmour contributed—as a session musician—lead vocals to two songs on the soundtrack of the film Two Weeks in September, starring Brigitte Bardot. In May, Gilmour briefly returned to London in search of new gear. During his stay, he watched Pink Floyd record [...] "See Emily Play" [...] and was shocked to find that Barrett did not seem to recognise him. When Bullitt returned to England later that year, they were so impoverished that their tour bus was completely empty of petrol and they had to push it off the ferry.|$|E

2500|$|Orbison {{also began}} collaborating with Bill Dees, {{whom he had}} known in Texas. With Dees, he wrote [...] "It's Over", a {{number one in the}} UK, and a song that would be one of his {{signature}} pieces {{for the rest of his}} career. When Claudette walked in the room where Dees and Orbison were writing to say she was heading for Nashville, Orbison asked if she had any money. Dees said, [...] "A pretty woman never needs any money". Just 40 minutes later, [...] "Oh, Pretty Woman" [...] was completed. A riff-laden masterpiece that employed a playful growl he got from a Bob Hope movie, the epithet [...] "mercy" [...] Orbison uttered when he was unable to hit a note, and a merging of his vulnerable and masculine sides, it rose to number one in the fall of 1964 in the US and stayed on the charts for 14 weeks. It hit number one in the UK as well, spending 18 weeks total on the charts. The single sold over seven million copies. Orbison's success was greater in Britain; as Billboard magazine noted, [...] "In a 68-week period that began on August 8, 1963, Roy Orbison was the only American artist to have a number-one single in Britain. He did it twice, with 'It's Over' on June 25, 1964, and 'Oh, Pretty Woman' on October 8, 1964. The latter song also went to number one in America, making Orbison impervious to the <b>current</b> <b>chart</b> dominance of British artists on both sides of the Atlantic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mike Diver of BBC Music gave a mixed review, {{writing that}} [...] "the songs of Who You Are are expectedly split between slower, slushier affairs and punchy anthems for bolshy teens" [...] {{and called the}} album [...] "too patchy, too hurried, the powers behind it too eager to {{capitalise}} on the artist's <b>current</b> <b>chart</b> success", although he felt that [...] "there's ample room for improvement". Ailbhe Malone from NME described it as [...] "cheeky, relevant, and fresh [...] but unfortunately [...] a flash that's shortly over" [...] and noticed that [...] "no matter how much Jessie J sings about being herself, we don't really ever {{get a sense of}} who, or what, that is". Gary McGinley of No Ripcord called it [...] "an album of two halves as the stronger brat-pop moments soon give way to by insipid, dated ballads"; he noted that [...] "there are glimpses of promise scattered between the overwrought delivery and unnecessary vocal gymnastics", but concluded by saying that Who You Are [...] "promised much more than what has been delivered". Fiona Shepherd [...] of The Scotsman wrote that it [...] "covers all the tried and tested commercial territory: mainly a slick, generic imitation of American R divas [...] blended with the obligatory hip-pop stance" [...] and felt that Cornish [...] "is more interested in tiresome vocal showboating than communicating anything truthful". Eric Henderson from Slant Magazine agreed, saying that [...] "in the quest to find herself, she seems to have gotten sidetracked". Matthew Perpetua of Pitchfork Media was particularly critical; he felt that [...] "the music is scattered, covering all the bases in an over-eager attempt to prove vocal chops" [...] and noticed that Cornish [...] "comes across like a severely dumbed-down Lily Allen at best, and at worst she seems like someone you would want to root against in a televised singing competition".|$|E

40|$|The authors {{propose a}} de-cluttering {{technique}} {{to simplify the}} depiction of visually complex Area Navigation (RNAV) and Required Navigation Performance (RNP) procedures by {{reducing the number of}} paths shown on a single chart page. An experiment was conducted to determine whether charts with fewer paths (“Modified charts”) allow improved access to information in terms of time and accuracy compared with charts that are currently used (“Current charts”). Data were collected from 28 airline and 19 corporate pilots. Results show that pilot response times were significantly improved with the Modified charts. For approach procedures, the mean response time was 16. 9 seconds for <b>Current</b> <b>charts</b> and 10. 7 seconds for Modified charts. For departure procedures, the mean response time was 16. 2 seconds for <b>Current</b> <b>charts</b> and 13. 2 seconds for Modified charts. This difference in response time between <b>Current</b> and Modified <b>charts</b> was consistent across the different procedures (approach and departure), pilot types (Airline and Corporate), and chart manufacturers (FAA and Jeppesen) included in the study. Additionally, pilots answered questions correctly 99. 5 % of the time with no difference in response accuracy between <b>Current</b> and Modified <b>charts.</b> Note, this experiment only evaluated the potential benefit of separating paths across multiple pages and did not explore the drawbacks to this decluttering technique...|$|R
