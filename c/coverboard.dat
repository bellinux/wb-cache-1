50|$|Langstroth {{revolutionized}} the beekeeping industry by using bee space in his top-opening hive. In {{the summer of}} 1851 he found that, by leaving an even, approximately bee-sized space between {{the top of the}} frames holding the honeycomb and the flat <b>coverboard</b> above, he was able quite easily to remove the <b>coverboard,</b> which was normally well cemented to the frames with propolis, making separation hard to achieve. He later used this discovery to make the frames themselves easily removable. If a small space was left (less than 1/4 inch or 6.4 mm) the bees filled it with propolis; on the other hand, when a larger space was left (more than 3/8 inch or 9.5 mm) the bees filled it with comb.|$|E

Each of the eight sites was sampled for four six-day periods between June and September each year {{using a combination of}} pitfall, Sherman and Tomahawk traps, <b>coverboards</b> and unbaited automatic camera stations. This effort yielded 12, 150 captures and 776 photo detections.

40|$|We {{surveyed}} the herpetofaunal (amphibian and reptile) communities inhabiting five types of habitat on a managed landscape. We conducted monthly surveys during 1997 in four replicate plots of each habitat type using several different methods of collection. Communities {{of the two}} wetland habitats (bottomland wetlands and isolated upland wetlands) were clearly dissimilar from the three terrestrial communities (recent clearcut, pine plantation, and mixed pine–hardwood forest). Among the three terrestrial habitats, the total herpetofaunal communities were dissimilar (P 3 ̆c 0. 10), although neither faunal constituent group alone (amphibians and squamate reptiles) varied significantly with regard to habitat. Three survey techniques used in the terrestrial habitats were not equally effective in that they resulted {{in the collection of}} different subsets of the total herpetofauna. The drift fence technique revealed the presence of more species and individuals in every habitat and was the only one to detect species dissimilarity among habitats. Nonetheless, <b>coverboards</b> contributed to measures of abundance and revealed species not detected by other techniques. We suggest that a combination of census techniques be used when surveying and monitoring herpetofaunal communities in order to maximize the detection of species...|$|R
40|$|Hemlock {{forests of}} the northeastern United States are declining due to the {{invasive}} hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) (Adelges tsugae). Hardwood species replace these forests, which affects soil properties that may influence other communities, such as red-backed salamanders (red-backs) (Plethodon cinereus). This study {{examined the effects of}} HWA invasion on soil properties and how this affects red-backs at the Hemlock Removal Experiment at Harvard Forest, which consists of eight 0. 8 ha plots treated with girdling to simulate HWA invasion, logging to simulate common management practices, or hemlock- or hardwood-dominated controls. <b>Coverboard</b> surveys were used to determine the relative abundance of red-backs between plots during June and July 2014 and soil cores were collected from which the bulk density, moisture, pH, temperature, leaf litter, and carbon-nitrogen ratio were measured. Ordination provided a soil quality index based on temperature, pH, and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, which was significantly different between plot treatments (p < 0. 05) and showed a significant negative correlation with the red-back relative abundance (p < 0. 05). The findings support the hypothesis that red-backs are affected by soil quality, which is affected by plot treatment and thus HWA invasion. Further studies should explore how salamanders react in the long term towards changing environments and consider the use of red-backs as indicator species...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} {{literature}} and standards revealed no standardized process exists for the evaluation or characterization of wind uplift resistance of Adhesive Applied Roofing Systems (AARS). It was determined that a pullout test method [...] a test in which the adhered components of roofing samples were subjected to tensile loading until failure [...] {{could be used to}} quantify wind uplift performance. From the literature study, critical variables were extracted. Among these were the pullout rate, the specimen size and the specimen attachment condition. After conducting a series of extensive pullout tests, data showed that the optimum pullout rate was 6. 35 mm/min. Additional tests showed that a specimen size of 300 mm x 450 mm with all flutes fastened provided the experimentally consistent data. Based on the investigation outlined above, the present study drafted a standard test method for the determination of the pullout resistance of adhesively applied roofing components. This contribution is being presented to the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) and American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) for adoption of a standardized test method. The present study also implemented the standardized test procedure to characterize the pullout behaviour of a variety of different configurations. Over 400 specimens were constructed varying the deck type (steel & concrete), insulation facer (paper and acrylic facer) and <b>coverboard</b> (fiberboard and asphalt core board). Experimental results showed that the use of steel deck, paper faced polyisocyanurate, and asphalt core board yielded optimum pullout resistance. Alternative adhesion patterns were also tested and showed a maximum reduction of 60 % from the optimized adhesion pattern...|$|E
40|$|Greater prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus cupido pinnata) are a {{grassland}} {{bird species}} of conservation concern. Although greater prairie-chickens have declined {{over much of}} their range, the Nebraska Sandhills has the largest population in North America. However, the responses of nest and brood site selection and survival to vegetation characteristics are unknown. I studied prairie-chickens on private rangelands in Rock and Brown Counties from 2009 - 2011. I fitted 139 females with radio collars to locate nest and brood sites and to determine nest and brood survival rates. Females were trapped on leks during the breeding season and I monitored them throughout the summer using radio telemetry. At nest and brood sites, I collected vegetation structure and composition data. Plant composition was estimated by functional groups using a quadrat method and vegetation structure was measured using the Robel pole and <b>coverboard.</b> I identified the ecological site and plant community at each nest and brood site. I then sampled to determine the relative availability of ecological sites and plant communities in each pasture to assess preference at a macroscale level. I also collected weather data throughout the reproductive season to assess variation in nest and brood survival. Prairie-chicken females tended to choose upland ecological sites for nesting and brood-rearing. Nest sites had more vegetation cover (VOR) (mean VOR: 10. 8 cm; SD= 0. 7) than coupled random sites (mean VOR: 4. 6 cm; SD= 0. 4). Nest site selection is positively associated with moderate levels of VOR and residual vegetation. Daily nest survival was poorly associated with habitat measures and was marginally associated with weather and temporal effects. Brood-rearing sites tended to have higher VOR and LD (mean VOR: 6. 92 cm, SD= 0. 62; mean LD: 0. 06 cm, SD= 0. 1) than at coupled random locations (mean VOR: 6. 45 cm, SD= 0. 37; mean LD: 0. 05 cm, SD= 0. 1). Higher forb cover and greater litter depth positively impacted daily brood survival. My research gives grassland managers much-needed information for managing prairie-chicken breeding habitat in the Nebraska Sandhills...|$|E
40|$|Deforestation {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of {{biodiversity}} loss. Globally, large areas of primary forest have been replaced by secondary forests and plantations, and changes in tree species composition have often led to alteration of plant and animal communities that were associated with those primary forests. Hong Kong has experienced a long history of deforestation and may be one of the pioneers in using exotic tree plantations for forest restoration in Asia. In this study, we sampled herpetofaunal assemblages in native, secondary forests and exotic Lophostemon confertus plantations by transect surveys, pitfall traps, and <b>coverboards.</b> Amphibians were more abundant in secondary forests than in plantations, while the abundance of reptiles and species compositions of both amphibians and reptiles were similar in both forest types. Body condition of the most common reptile, Sphenomorphus indicus (Indian forest skink), was similar between secondary forests and plantations. However, higher proportions of S. indicus exhibited autotomized or missing tails in secondary forests than in plantations, which may be related to higher percentages of rock and wood cover on the forest floor potentially increasing the chance of escape from predators in secondary forests. Secondary forests may provide a better habitat for herpetofauna, we suggest that planting of a mixture of native tree species and thinning of exotic trees may be favorable management efforts to enhance biodiversity in future plantation in South China. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|We {{studied a}} fossorial endemic lizard (the sand skink, Plestiodon reynoldsi) to {{determine}} habitat structural and vegetation associations in altered habitats at micro-, local, and macroscales. Lizards {{were present in}} each of the structural categories and vegetation types we studied, although active orange groves negatively influenced distribution and relative density (determined as the proportion of <b>coverboards</b> within a sampling plot containing signs of sand skink presence). Conversely, relative densities were highest in forested habitats, which contain structural features similar to natural habitats. Sand skinks readily used the two soil types at our site, although the greatest densities were in sampling plots containing both types. We conclude that conditions are suitable for sand skink habitation within a variety of habitats with different structures, including those altered by humans. However, in all cases the underlying soil was also loose and dry, making fossorial locomotion possible for this species. Three lines of evidence suggest that populations in altered habitats were resident, rather than transient: (1) sand skinks are still present in altered habitats more than 35 skink generations after alteration occurred; (2) there was no relationship between sand skink density and distance to natural habitat; and (3) a very small portion of our site (< 2 %) consisted of natural habitat, which is most likely too small to be a long-term source population to nearby altered habitats. Our results indicate that although P. reynoldsi is often considered habitat-specific, this notion may be due to focusing sampling efforts on natural rather than disturbed habitats. Therefore, relying on preconceived notions of habitat associations may not be sufficient to understand the ecological relationships and local-scale distribution of this threatened species. Using such misinformation may lead to the design and implementation of inadequate conservation plans that ignore altered habitats in which focal species occur...|$|R
40|$|Livestock grazing is {{a common}} and {{extensive}} land use practice in the United States occurring {{in a wide range}} of habitat types. As such, livestock grazing has the potential to alter ecosystem structure, function and community composition. The primary component (Chapter 1) of this thesis examined the effects of cattle grazing in a San Joaquin Valley grassland on two target taxa: reptiles and small mammals. The study took place on the Chimineas Unit of the Carrizo Ecological Reserve, San Luis Obispo County, California during Fall 2009 and Spring 2010. These taxa were sampled on matched pairs of two grazed and two ungrazed sites. Live trapping methods appropriate to sampling reptiles (<b>coverboards</b> and pit fall traps) and small mammals (Sherman live traps) were used to determine species richness and abundance of these taxa. Uta stansburiana (side-blotched lizard) abundances were greatest on Ungrazed 1 (Fall: 1. 75 ± 0. 49 captures/night, Spring: 3. 58 ± 0. 35 captures/night). In addition, Chaetodipus californicus (Spiny pocket mouse) abundance was also greatest on Ungrazed 1. Population estimates generated by Program CAPTURE suggest C. californicus could be 6. 27 times more abundant on Ungrazed 1 than Grazed 1. However, sample size issues and site level effects confounded and made it difficult to determine significant differences between the grazed and ungrazed treatments for both reptile and small mammal taxa. Habitat structure at these sites was also evaluated including small mammal burrow abundance and vegetation structure. Again, differences between the grazed and ungrazed pasture could not be discerned because of site level effects occurring among matched pairs. As such, this thesis illustrates the difficulty in studying grazing and its potential effects on biotic systems because an array of variables can make unclear the differences between grazed and ungrazed areas. As a follow up study (Chapter 2) I used logistic regression to model U. stansburiana presence to examine possible sources of variation observed at trapping array locations utilized in the main study (Chapter 1). Shrubs exhibited a quasi-complete separation of data points and the three best models included: 1) Bare soil cover (AICc = 28. 12), 2) Holes (AICc = 29. 76), and 3) Bare soil cover + Holes (AICc = 29. 90). Shrubs, bare soil cover and small mammal burrow density were all positively associated with U. stansburiana presence at array locations. Although species have general habitat requirements based upon their ecology and evolution, variations in habitat utilization exists depending upon the resources present at a specific location. Quantifying basic ecological information on a site specific basis is important to managing populations by identifying important resources and habitat components utilized by a given species on a given site...|$|R
40|$|Globally, {{as many as}} 30 % of {{amphibians}} and 23 % of reptile {{species are}} threatened and require urgent conservation action. The major threats are primarily caused by anthropogenic activities. This research aimed to investigate the impacts of two anthropogenic threats, over-exploitation and habitat changes on herpetofaunal populations in Hong Kong. Platysternon megacephalum has been heavily depleted because of severe hunting pressure for the food and pet trades. Low densities of individuals and few remaining intact populations have limited our ability to study their ecology. I conducted mark-recapture and radio-telemetry studies on P. megacephalum populations in five streams in Hong Kong, {{one of which was}} free from trapping, over 34 months (2009 – 2011) to investigate the impacts of illegal trapping on populations of P. megacephalum and their spatial ecology and growth. Illegal trapping was associated with the absence of large adults, smaller body sizes of adults and skewed ratios of juveniles to adults. Home ranges were relatively small with a mean 100 % minimum convex polygon 996 m 2. Males moved longer distances than females and both sexes moved longer distances in wet seasons. P. megacephalum was highly aquatic, preferring to stay in pools, and their microhabitat preferences were affected by stream width and depth, and substrate types. Juvenile P. megacephalum grew rapidly, with growth declining after attainment of sexual maturity. The average ages of sexual maturation were eight years for females. Illegal trapping remains the major threat to P. megacephalum populations and I recommend that regulatory personnel identify key streams and patrol regularly against illegal trapping to safeguard remaining populations. In Hong Kong, large areas of primary forest have been replaced by secondary forests and plantations, and changes in tree species composition have often led to alteration of associated plant and animal communities. I examined the herpetofaunal assemblages in secondary forests and exotic Lophostemon confertus plantations. Amphibian abundances were higher in secondary forests while reptile abundance, species richness of amphibian and reptiles were similar. Secondary forests provided better habitats for amphibians and I recommend the planting of a mixture of native tree species and the thinning of exotic trees in future plantation management efforts in South China. Our knowledge about the effectiveness of different herpetofaunal survey methods in Southeast Asia is limited. To fill the information gap, I examined the effectiveness of three survey methods, including transect surveys, pitfall traps and <b>coverboards,</b> for sampling terrestrial herpetofauna. Transect surveys were most effective at sampling species richness and pitfall traps were most efficient in capturing high numbers of reptiles. The results of this study will aid researchers in assessing the feasibility of and choosing herpetofaunal survey methods in Southeast Asia. Despite the severe threats that herpetofauna are facing, our understanding of their ecology and conservation needs remains limited. More research and the initiation of monitoring programs for herpetofauna, strengthened enforcement of existing regulations, and proper habitat management are crucial for the conservation of herpetofauna in South China. published_or_final_versionBiological SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
