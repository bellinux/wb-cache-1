50|$|Araneus cavaticus, {{commonly}} known as the barn spider, is a <b>common</b> <b>orb-weaver</b> spider native to North America. They are around three-quarters of an inch (20 mm) in length and are usually yellow and brown in color. They often construct their webs in wooden human structures, hence their common name. The species is notable for being the basis for the character Charlotte in the book Charlotte's Web by American writer E. B. White.|$|E
5000|$|Neoscona arabesca is a <b>common</b> <b>orb-weaver</b> spider found {{throughout}} the United States and Canada. Often called the [...] "arabesque orbweaver," [...] after the cryptic, brightly-colored, swirling markings on its prominent abdomen, this spider {{can be found in}} fields, forests, gardens, and on human structures. Neoscona species are among the most common and abundant orb weavers and are found on all continents. Females range in size from 5-7 mm and males 5-6 mm.|$|E
50|$|Araneus quadratus, the four-spot orb-weaver, is a <b>common</b> <b>orb-weaver</b> spider {{found in}} Europe and Central Asia, {{and as far}} as the Kamchatka Peninsula and Japan. Females can reach 17 mm in length, {{especially}} when gravid, males approximately half that. They are quite variable in appearance, ranging from brown to bright orange or green, but they always have the characteristic four white spots on the abdomen. The darker color morphs are easiest to identify, due to the contrast between the white spots and the rest of the body. The legs are sometimes brightly striped.The spider lives in gardens, wooded areas, or wherever there is vegetation to string an orb web across. This species builds its web close to the ground to catch jumping insects such as small grasshoppers. The female builds the more elaborate web, complete with a funnel-shaped retreat off to the side where she goes during inclement weather. The web is smaller and closer to the ground than those of other species of orb-weaver.|$|E

50|$|Araneus gemmoides, {{commonly}} known as the jewel spider (a name shared with Austracantha minax) and cat-faced spider (a name shared with Araneus gemma), is a <b>common</b> outdoor <b>orb-weaver</b> spider found in the USA and Canada. They are considered harmless and have low-toxicity venom. A. gemmoides are useful natural predators for insects.|$|R
5000|$|Parawaixia dehaani is nocturnal and feeds {{mainly on}} moths. During {{the day the}} spider shelters under a leaf in the vegetation. [...] It builds a {{vertical}} orb web with an open hub, which often looks damaged, with sections missing, hence the Australian <b>common</b> name, abandoned-web <b>orb-weaver.</b> When disturbed the spiders {{falls to the ground}} and plays dead with its legs retracted. Bats have been recorded as being captured by this spider.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. â€¢Extreme sexual {{body size}} {{dimorphism}} (SSD), in which males {{are only a}} small fraction of the size of the females, occurs only in a few, mostly marine, taxonomic groups. Spiders are the only terrestrial group in which small males are relatively <b>common,</b> particularly among <b>orb-weavers</b> (especially in the families Tetragnathidae and Araneidae) and crab spiders (Thomisidae). We used a taxonomic sample of 80 genera to study the phylogenetic patterns (origins and reversals) of SSD in orb-weaving spiders (Orbiculariae). We collected and compiled male and female size data (adult body length) for 536 species. Size data were treated as a continuous character, and ancestral sizes, for males and females separately, were reconstructed by using Wagner parsimony on a cladogram for the 80 genera used in this study. Of these 80 genera, 24 were female-biased dimorphic (twice or more the body length of the male); the remaining 56 genera were monomorphic. Under parsimony only four independent origins of dimorphism are required: in the theridiid genus Tidarren, in the distal nephilines, in the "argiopoid clade, " and in the araneid genus Kaira. Dimorphism has reversed to monomorphism at least seven times, all of them within the large "argiopoid clade. " The four independent origins of dimorphism represent two separate instances of an increase in female size coupled with a decrease of male size (involving only two genera), and two separate instances of a...|$|R
