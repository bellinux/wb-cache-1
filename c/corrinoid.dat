The bacterium assimilated several <b>corrinoids</b> and benzimidazole bases during autotrophic growth. The <b>corrinoids</b> were converted into factor III; however, after three transfers in 5, 6 -dimethylbenzimidazole (200 microM) -supplemented mineral medium, derivatives of factor III were completely replaced by derivatives of vitamin B 12, which is atypical for methanogens. The total cobamide content of these cells and their growth rate were not affected compared with factor III-containing cells. Therefore, the high cobamide content rather than {{a particular type of}} cobamide is required for metabolism of methanogens. Derivatives of factor III are not essential cofactors of cobamide-containing enzymes from methanogenic bacteria, but they are the result of a unique biosynthetic ability of these archaebacteria. The cobamide biosynthesis include unspecific enzymes, which made it possible either to convert non-species-derived <b>corrinoids</b> into derivatives of factor III or to synthesize other types of cobamides than factor III. The cobamide biosynthesis is regulated by its end product. In addition, the uptake of extracellular cobamides is controlled, and the assimilated <b>corrinoids</b> regulate cellular cobamide biosynthesis...|$|R

Samples were taken from either cobalt-deficient or cobalt-replete ewes, and ruminant and pre-ruminant lambs. In liver, ado-cbl predominated, followed by analogues, OH-cbl and me-cbl. Supplementation with either cobalt (ruminant) or vitamin B 12 injections (pre-ruminant) increased the amount of ado-cbl and decreased analogues. In blood, OH-cbl predominated, followed by ado-cbl, analogues and me-cbl, respectively. In small intestinal fluid, the distribution from largest to smallest percentage was analogues, ado-cbl, OH-cbl and me-cbl. In faeces, analogues constituted the greatest proportion, followed by OH-cbl, ado-cbl and me-cbl, respectively. Owing to the small sample sizes only cautionary interpretations can be made. In contrast to humans, where me-cbl constitutes the highest proportion of <b>corrinoids</b> in plasma and ado-cbl in the liver, in sheep the amount of ado-cbl was consistently higher than me-cbl in all tissues.

40|$|Corrin macrocycles {{are well}} known for their {{interesting}} and multifaceted coordination chemistry at the axial positions of the cobalt center. In this work, {{the use of such}} cobalt <b>corrinoids</b> as sensitive elements for sorption based chemical sensors like the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is described for the first time. This approach of fast and reversible ion detection extends the versatility and applicability of this class of metal-containing ionophores and colorimetric indicators. QCMs were grafted with aquacyano and dicyano cobalt <b>corrinoids</b> and assessed in their sensing characteristics during exposure to cyanide, thiocyanate, and other ionic species as well as selected organic compounds. The liquid sensing characteristics of the corronoids were found to be excellent. Sensors reach equilibrium in < 3 s from the stable baseline after analyte exposure and the responses are fully reversible. Sensors of high sensitivity and selectivity for cyanide have been obtained with detection limits at 1 μM. At the same time, the sensitivities to common organic compounds are negligible. The results demonstrate that corrin grafted QCMs exhibit enormous potential as chemical sensors for the detection of anions, especially cyanide, in aqueous samples...|$|R
40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{study of the}} structure and electronic properties of Co-corrole, Co-corrin. and Co-porphyrin, using density functional theory, is reported. The structure of each macrocycle is optimized, with no symmetry constraints, by considering different spin states. The ground-state structures and spin states (S = 1 for Co-corrole, S = 0 for Co-corrin and S = 1 / 2 for Co-porphyrin) are in good agreement with the experimental data available. The trends in the sizes of the coordination cavities upon varying the inner metal atom and/or the macrocycle are analyzed and compared with those for the Fe-porphyrin we studied previously. Our results reveal {{that most of the}} distortion of the Co-corrin core in the B- 12. coenzyme is due to the inherent properties of Co-corrin. Quite different behaviors are found between <b>corrinoids</b> and porphyrins upon varying the spin state. While an increase in the metal-nitrogen (M-N) distance with spin state occurs in the porphyrins, the <b>corrinoids</b> show little variation in the M-N distance and, in some cases, undergo small structural changes in the ring structure.

40|$|In {{extracts}} of {{polyethylene glycol}} (PEG) -grown {{cells of the}} strictly anaerobically fermenting bacterium Pelobacter venetianus, two different enzyme activities were detected, a diol dehydratase and a PEG-degrading enzyme which was characterized as a PEG acetaldehyde lyase. Both enzymes were oxygen sensitive and depended on a reductant, such as titanium citrate or sulfhydryl compounds, for optimal activity. The diol dehydratase was inhibited by various <b>corrinoids</b> (adenosylcobalamin, cyanocobalamin, hydroxocobalamin, and methylcobalamin) by up to 37 % at a concentration of 100 μM. Changes in ionic strength and the K+ ion concentration had only limited effects on this enzyme activity; glycerol inhibited the enzyme by 95 %. The PEG-degrading enzyme activity was stimulated by the same <b>corrinoids</b> by up to 80 %, exhibited optimal activity in 0. 75 M potassium phosphate buffer or {{in the presence of}} 4 M KCI, and was only slightly affected by glycerol. Both enzymes were located in the cytoplasmic space. Also, another PEG-degrading bacterium, Bacteroides strain PG 1, contained a PEG acetaldehyde lyase activity analogous to the corresponding enzyme of P. venetianus but no diol dehydratase.

50|$|CobW {{proteins}} {{are generally}} found proximal to the trimeric cobaltochelatase subunit CobN, which {{is essential for}} vitamin B12 (cobalamin) biosynthesis. They contain a P-loop nucleotide-binding loop in the N-terminal domain and a histidine-rich region in the C-terminal portion suggesting a role in metal binding, possibly as an intermediary between the cobalt transport and chelation systems. CobW might be involved in cobalt reduction leading to cobalt(I) <b>corrinoids.</b> CobW-like proteins include P47K, a Pseudomonas chlororaphis protein needed for nitrile hydratase expression, and urease accessory protein UreG, which acts as a chaperone in the activation of urease upon insertion of nickel into the active site.|$|R

A new class of mutant (CobIV) defective in B 12 biosynthesis was isolated and characterized. These mutations map between the cysB and trp loci (minute 34) and define a new genetic locus, cobA. The anaerobic phenotype of cobA mutants suggests an early block in corrin ring formation; mutants failed {{to synthesize}} cobalamin de novo but did so when the corrin ring is provided as cobyric acid dicyanide or as cobinamide dicyanide. Under aerobic conditions, cobA mutants were unable to convert either cobyric acid dicyanide or cobinamide dicyanide to cobalamin but could use adenosylcobyric acid or adenosylcobinamide as a precursor; {{this suggests that the}} mutants are unable to adenosylate exogenous <b>corrinoids.</b> To explain the anaerobic CobI phenotype of a cobA mutant, we propose that the cobA gene product catalyzes adenosylation of an early intermediate in the de novo B 12 pathway and also adenosylates exogenous <b>corrinoids.</b> Under anaerobic conditions, a substitute function, known to be encoded in the main Cob operons, is induced; this substitute function can adenosylate exogenous cobyric acid and cobinamide but not the early biosynthetic intermediate.
