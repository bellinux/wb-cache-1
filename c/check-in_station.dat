50|$|Cedar Creek State Park is sited on 2588 acre along Cedar Creek in Gilmer County, West Virginia, {{located about}} 4 mi south of Glenville. Two of the {{buildings}} at the park are historical restorations of West Virginia's pioneer days, including a log cabin now used as the campground <b>check-in</b> <b>station,</b> and the Pine Run One Room School, an old one-room schoolhouse complete with restored school desks and potbellied stove. The schoolhouse is open for tours on Saturdays in the summer.|$|E
50|$|While {{fighting}} in the final of another Other World Tournament, Goku and Pikkon are interrupted {{by the appearance of}} a crystal-like substance all over the place, and are sent to see to the disturbance. They find the <b>Check-In</b> <b>Station</b> and most of the Other World encased in crystal-like jelly beans which are immune to their energy attacks. From inside the station, King Yemma directs them to the culprit, sitting on the roof. The monster, who is unable to say anything other than its own name, Janemba, refuses to put the barrier back after Pikkon insists. Goku decides to lure Janemba down to Hell to fight him while Pikkon tries to free King Yemma.|$|E
5000|$|During the Masaki clan's {{trip through}} the Jurai checkpoint, Sagami met Tenchi (disguised as a girl named Tenko) after he went to <b>check-in</b> <b>station.</b> Sagami {{then went to the}} Cafe with Sasami and Tenchi, but after Ryōko and Mihoshi came through when Mihoshi's bungling had exposed them, Sagami was able to help slow down some of the guards. Later when Sasami was {{separated}} from the group, Sagami knocked out the guards that heard her and then gave Tenchi a staff to fight off the guards, although it exposed Tenchi's true identity to him. It turned out that Sagami was an agent of Sasami and Ayeka's uncle and was helping the group {{in order for them to}} make it into Jurai territory.|$|E

40|$|The {{movement}} of passengers through an airport quickly, safely, and efficiently {{is the main}} function of the various checkpoints (check-in, security. etc) found in airports. Human error combined with other breakdowns in the complex system of the airport can disrupt passenger flow through the airport leading to lengthy waiting times, missing luggage and missed flights. In this paper we present a model of passenger flow through an airport using discrete event simulation that will provide a closer look into the possible reasons for breakdowns and their implications for passenger flow. The simulation is based on data collected at Norfolk International Airport (ORF). The primary goal of this simulation is to present ways to optimize the work force to keep passenger flow smooth even during peak travel times and for emergency preparedness at ORF in case of adverse events. In this simulation we ran three different scenarios: real world, increased <b>check-in</b> <b>stations,</b> and multiple waiting lines. Increased <b>check-in</b> <b>stations</b> increased waiting time and instantaneous utilization. while the multiple waiting lines decreased both the waiting time and instantaneous utilization. This simulation was able to show how different changes affected the passenger flow through the airport...|$|R

40|$|Scheduling <b>check-in</b> <b>station</b> {{operations}} are a challenging problem within airport systems. Prior to determining check-in resource schedules, {{an important step}} is to estimate the Baggage Handling System (BHS) operating capacity under non-stationary conditions. This ensures that check-in stations are not overloaded with bags, which would adversely affect the system and cause cascade stops and blockages. Cascading blockages can potentially lead to {{a poor level of}} service and in worst scenario a customer may depart without their bags. This paper presents an empirical study of a multiobjective problem within a BHS system. The goal is to estimate near optimal input operating conditions, such that no blockages occurs at check-in stations, while minimising the baggage travel time and maximising the throughput performance measures. We provide a practical hybrid simulation and binary search technique to determine a near optimal input throughput operating condition. The algorithm generates capacity constraint information that may be used by a scheduler to plan check-in operations based on flight arrival schedules. <br /...|$|E

50|$|The terminal, in the Otay Mesa {{neighborhood}} of San Diego, allows passengers {{to check in}} on the U.S. side of the U.S.-Mexico border, cross a 390 ft pedestrian/passenger bridge across the border, clear Mexican immigration and customs, and catch their flights at the Tijuana International Airport. Passengers arriving in Tijuana are equally able to cross the pedestrian/passenger bridge into the Otay Mesa passenger terminal, clear U.S. passport controls and U.S. Customs, and exit on the U.S. side. The terminal building in Otay Mesa serves only as a check-in and processing facility for departing and arriving passengers. It has its own parking, <b>check-in</b> <b>stations,</b> and customs offices, but no gates or arrival facilities (thus functionally resembling Hong Kong International Airport's Terminal 2). The structural scheme is intended to allow greater access to flights out of Tijuana Airport for both domestic and international air carriers.|$|R
40|$|Many {{variations}} on the Art Gallery problem have been proposed, a comprehensive list {{can be found in}} O'Rourke's book [7] and in Shermer's survey [8]. We propose yet another another variation, that surprisingly has not been studied before. The motivation follows from a common practice with real-life guards. In real-life, almost any area can be guarded by a single, mobile guard. However, if left to his own devices, a security guard may not patrol as often nor as thoroughly as the employer wishes. To ensure compliance <b>check-in</b> <b>stations</b> that the guard has to physically visit on a regular basis may be installed. The lazy guard problem is thus as follows: Given a polygon, choose a minimum number of stations (points) in the polygon such that a mobile guard that visits all stations will guard the entire polygon. A polygon that can be guarded with k stations is said to be lazy k guardable...|$|R

50|$|In its 20-year {{master plan}} {{developed}} in 2007, YVR identified {{the possibilities of}} locating certain terminal facilities (such as passenger and baggage <b>check-in)</b> at the <b>station</b> in order to relieve congestion at existing terminal curbside spaces, and providing new long-term public and employee parking near the <b>station.</b> Self-service passenger <b>check-in</b> kiosks have been installed at Templeton station, alongside several other stations on the Canada Line.|$|R
50|$|Unlike other {{international}} train services within the European Union where border controls have either {{had a long}} history of operation or are no longer enforced, the UK maintains concerns about customs and immigration. The inter-capital services still operate separately {{from the rest of the}} British railway network with passport checks carried out at St Pancras, Ebbsfleet International and Ashford International stations. There was concern that similar tight control would not be possible upon regional Eurostar services where separate <b>check-in</b> facilities at <b>stations</b> did not exist.|$|R
50|$|From 4 January 2011, a baggage {{check-in}} service began {{for passengers}} traveling on flights operated by Thai Airways International, 08:00-21:00. Passengers checking in at Makkasan station (the city air terminal) {{were required to}} purchase an Express Line ticket and check in at least between 3 and 12 hours in prior to flight departure. Bangkok Airways discontinued baggage check-in service in this facility on 13 June 2011. However, very few passengers—20 or fewer per day—used the Makkasan <b>station</b> <b>check-in</b> service. The SRTET stated {{that they wanted to}} encourage further airlines to use the City check in service in early 2014 with a target of 1,000 people a day by late 2014. However, in July 2014 the SRTET stated that it would most likely cease check-in operations as only 10 people were using it a day with only 200 pieces of luggage checked in each month. The service was costing SRTET 5.27m baht a month. Check-in services ceased in September 2014.|$|R
