40|$|Background – Streptococcal pharyngitis is not {{prevalent}} among individuals above 15 {{years of age}} and as a result, there is little research conducted on this age group. Hence, the aim {{of this study was to}} detect the prevalence of group A βhemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) among healthy individuals between 15 to 18 years of age. Methods – Using cluster sampling methods, 546 individuals aged from 15 to 18 years were randomly selected from a population of high school students in District 3 of Education Organization (Tehran, Iran). The results of throat cultures, demographic data, contents of tonsillar enlargement, <b>cryptic</b> <b>tonsillitis</b> and the level of education of individuals parents were evaluated. Results – Of the total of 546 students, 49 (9 %) had GABHS in their pharynxes. Seventeen (60 %) of the 28 students in which asymptomatic pharyngitis and/or <b>cryptic</b> <b>tonsillitis</b> was documented had GABHS in their pharynxes. Tonsillar enlargement was not a significant risk factor for being a carrier of GABHS. Lower level of parents education was associated with a positive rate of GABHS. Conclusion – Compared to developed countries, the higher prevalence of GABHS carriers in our study probably indicates that there is a significant number of children with untreated or partially-treated streptococcal pharyngitis. With the recent removal of legal restrictions in the prescription of injectable penicillins for children, a complete course of antibiotic treatment is highly recommended...|$|E
40|$|AbstractKounis {{syndrome}} is a life-threatening medical condition that causes severe allergic reaction and acute coronary syndrome. Benzathine penicillin G {{is one of}} the most widely used antibiotics in clinical practice, but it can enhance both allergic and hypersensitivity complications. In this report, we describe the case of a 42 -year-old man admitted to our hospital who presented with <b>cryptic</b> <b>tonsillitis</b> accompanied by angioneurotic edema, chest pain, and electrocardiographic variations. The patient was diagnosed with Kounis syndrome and treated with oral antihistamines and prednisolone. He was discharged following a complete recovery and regression of electrocardiographic abnormalities within 72 hours...|$|E
40|$|Tonsillectomy is a {{frequently}} performed {{surgical procedure}} {{in children and}} adults. Postoperative bleeding is the most severe complication; however, the factors leading to postoperative haemorrhage are still discussed controversially. 1, 522 tonsillectomies were retrospectively reviewed. Histopathological tonsil composition was correlated with the incidence of postoperative haemorrhage. Patient charts were analysed with regard to demographic data, characteristics of postoperative haemorrhage and indication for surgery. Patients with post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage were compared with uneventful cases. Histopathological signs of <b>cryptic</b> <b>tonsillitis</b> and actinomyces infection displayed a statistically significant correlation with the risk of postoperative haemorrhage (P = 0. 018 and P = 0. 02), but the odds ratio was low (1. 9 and 2. 0). 7. 7 % of all patients had postoperative bleeding and 3. 5 % {{had to return to}} theatre for haemostasis. The incidence of haemorrhages within hospitalization (5 postoperative days) was 45 % and after discharge 55 %, respectively. In 11 % of cases bleeding occurred on the fourth or fifth day after surgery. While gender, season of surgery, abscess tonsillectomy "en chaud" in comparison with elective tonsillectomy were not associated with an increased rate of postoperative haemorrhage (P < 0. 05), significant more postoperative haemorrhages were detected in the group of adults (P = 0. 02). Despite significant correlation of <b>cryptic</b> <b>tonsillitis</b> and actinomyces infection with postoperative haemorrhage, the risk for postoperative bleeding is only slightly elevated and, therefore, the predictive value is low. Because a multifactorial aetiology of post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage has to be assumed, large multicenter studies are necessary to evaluate the significance of different risk factors...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{consider}} clinical features, laboratory findings, treatment alternatives, complications and responsible agents of Steven’s Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) in childhood. Materials and Method: The patients who were diagnosed with Steven’s Johnson syndrome (SJS) or Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) and followed by Department of Dermatology, Division of Pediatric Neurology and Division of Pediatric Allergy of Uludag University Faculty of Medicine, between 2000 - 2008 were evaluated retrospectively. Results: Records of 14 patients (7 females/ 7 males) were examined. Nine of the patients had SJS, 2 had SJS-TEN overlap syndrome and the rest 3 had TEN. Nine patients had history of using drugs for epilepsy and the others for anxiety, tooth abscess, <b>cryptic</b> <b>tonsillitis,</b> otitis media and bronchiolitis. Eleven of the patients (78. 5 %) had multiple drug intake. In 7 patients (50 %) Lamotrigine (4 of 7 patients was also taken Valproic acid) and in other patients oxcarbamazepine, azytromicine, phenytoin, imipramine, cefuroxime axetil, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone were responsible for SJS and TEN. Twelve patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids and 2 with intravenous immunoglobulin. All of the patients were cured. Conclusion: Although drug reactions were seen less frequently in children compared to adults, it must be taken into consideration that there is the risk of developing severe drug reactions like SJS and TEN in children who have been using such drugs for a long time or using multipl drugs for extended periods.
