40|$|AbstractWe analyse some {{properties}} of two-dimensional iterative and <b>cellular</b> <b>arrays.</b> For example, {{we show that}} arrays operating in T(n) time can be sped up to operate in time n+(T(n) −n) k. Thus, a running time of the form n+R(n), where R(n) is sublinear (e. g., log n, log∗n, etc.), can still be sped up to n+R(n) k. This type of speed-up is stronger than any previously known speed-up for any type of device. Even for Turing machines, the speed-up is only from T(n) to n+T(n) k. Another interesting result is that simultaneous space-reduction and speed-up is possible, i. e., the number of processors of the array can be reduced while simultaneously speeding up its computation. Unlike previous approaches, we carry out our analyses using sequential machine characterizations of the iterative and <b>cellular</b> <b>arrays.</b> Consequently, {{we are able to}} prove our results on the much simpler sequential machine models...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} plasma stencilling techniques for patterning 10 mammalian cell lines on hydrophobic and cell repellent poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), methylated glass and bacterial grade polystyrene surfaces. An air plasma produced with a Tesla generator operating at atmospheric pressure was used with micro-engineered stencils for patterned surface oxidation, selectively transforming {{the surface to}} a hydrophilic state to enable cell adhesion and growth. Plasma stencilling obviates the need for directly patterning cell adhesion molecules. Instead, during cell culture, adhesion proteins from the media assemble in a bioactive form on the hydrophilic regions. Critically, the removal of protein patterning prior to cell culture provides the option to also use PDMS-PDMS plasma bonding to incorporate cell patterns within microfluidic systems. Linear patterns were generated using PDMS microchannel stencils, and polyimide stencils with through holes {{were used for the}} production of <b>cellular</b> <b>arrays.</b> For the production of smaller <b>cellular</b> <b>arrays,</b> a novel microcapillary-based dielectric barrier discharge system was developed.

40|$|A {{definition}} {{for a class}} of asynchronous <b>cellular</b> <b>arrays</b> is proposed. An example of such asynchrony would be independent Poisson arrivals of cell iterations. The Ising model in the continuous time formulation of Glauber falls into this class. Also proposed are efficient parallel algorithms for simulating these asynchronous <b>cellular</b> <b>arrays.</b> In the algorithms, one or several cells are assigned to a processing element (PE), local times for different PEs can be different. Although the standard serial algorithm by Metropolis, Rosenbluth, Rosenbluth, Teller, and Teller can simulate such arrays, it is usually believed to be without an efficient parallel counterpart. However, the proposed parallel algorithms contradict this belief proving to be both efficient and able to perform the same task as the standard algorithm. The results of experiments with the new algorithms are encouraging: the speed-up is greater than 16 using 25 PEs on a shared memory MIMD bus computer, and greater than 1900 using 2 ** 14 PEs on a SIMD computer. The algorithm by Bortz, Kalos, and Lebowitz can be incorporated in the proposed parallel algorithms, further contributing to speed-up.

40|$|Introduction Since {{the field}} of image algebra is a recent {{development}} it will be instructive to provide some background information. In the broad sense, image algebra is a mathematical theory concerned with the transformation and analysis of images. Although much emphasis {{is focused on the}} analysis and transformation of digital images, the main goal is the establishment of a comprehensive and unifying theory of image transformations, image analysis, and image understanding in the discrete as well as the continuous domain [36]. The idea of establishing a unifying theory for the various concepts and operations encountered in image and signal processing is not new. Over thirty years ago, Unger proposed that many algorithms for image processing and image analysis could be implemented in parallel using <b>cellular</b> <b>array</b> computers [46]. These <b>cellular</b> <b>array</b> computers were inspired by the work of von Neumann in the 1950 s [48, 49]. Realization of von Neumann's cellular arra...|$|E

40|$|The {{family of}} FIR digital filters with maximally flat {{magnitude}} and group delay response is considered. The filters were proposed by Baher, who furnished {{them with an}} analytic procedure for derivation of their transfer function. The contributions of this paper are the following. A simplified formula is presented for the transfer function of the filters. The equivalence of the novel formula with a formula that is derived from Baher's analytical procedure is proved using a modern method for automatic proof of identities involving binomial coefficients. The universality of Baher's filters is then established by proving that they include linear-phase filters, generalized half-band filters, and fractional delay systems. In this way, several classes of maximally flat filters are unified under a single formula. The generating function of the filters is also derived. This enables us to develop multiplierless <b>cellular</b> <b>array</b> structures for exact realization of {{a subset of the}} filters. The subset that enjoys such multiplierless realizations includes linear-phase filters, some nonsymmetric filters, and generalized halfband filters.
