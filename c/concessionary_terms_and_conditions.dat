40|$|This study {{tries to}} explore the {{financing}} opportunity for smallholder cocoa farmers available at capital markets through enterprise growth market (EGM) financing window. The research findings from 122 cocoa farmers revealed that, in average a single cocoa farmer needed Tshs. 551, 808. 12 per acre as capital investment in a given season. At the time of data collection the cocoa prices at London and New York futures markets were Tshs. 6, 266. 75 /Kg and Tshs. 6, 148. 62 /Kg respectively at prevailed rates which were far above the production cost. In this case the envisaged gross margin was sufficient to service issuers’ interest of running their business lucratively and collectors’ interests of getting their investment needs met. The study considered the <b>concessionary</b> <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> on EGM for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to fit cocoa sector in the financial arrangement. Cocoa farmers could raise needed capital for cocoa businesses from the public who would later become shareholders to such businesses. With Bank of Tanzania (BOT) being the guarantor, the findings concluded that the financing arrangement was viable since the interests of issuers and collectors were protected. Capital markets financing could now become an alternative best solution for finance to smallholder farmers following poor accessibility of the same from existing sources especially financial institutions...|$|E

40|$|The chapter {{investigates the}} role of the oil majors (the so called "seven sisters") in the events leading to the 1973 crisis. The basic {{assumption}} is that 1973 was the outcome of a process set in motion some years earlier. The 1969 Libyan military coup could be identified as the starting date of a triangular dialectic which involved oilcompanies, producing and consumer countries, that resulted in the demise of the Western oil companies' absolute control on Mideastern crude and drastically increased the price. In this critical phase the companies were in direct charge of the negotiations with the producing countries. Our narrative concentrates on the events between Summer 1970, when the new Libyan governmentdemanded a revision of the <b>concessionary</b> <b>terms,</b> <b>and</b> February 1971, when a group of thirteen companies and the Persian Gulf producer governments signed in Tehran an agreement on new prices. We attempt, in this chapter, to go a step further, relative to the existing literature, and to investigate these negotiations in the light of some of the available primary sources...|$|R

40|$|A {{review of}} U. S. case law {{finds that the}} web-based {{approach}} used by most hotel companies to alert cus-tomers to the <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> for making an inter-net reservation might not hold up {{in the event of}} a lawsuit. Most courts will enforce a so-called click wrap covenant when an individual makes a reservation or purchase on the company website. In the click wrap procedure, a reservation cannot be completed until the customer clicks the “agree ” button to the <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> of sale. However, most hotel websites use a slightly different approach, known as “browse wrap, ” in which the <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> are available on the site but the reservation can be completed without the cus-tomer’s express assent. The <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> usu-ally dictate the controlling legal jurisdiction or mandate arbitration for disagreements, and thus it is in the hotel company’s interest to demonstrate that would-be guests have read and definitively agreed to those <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R

40|$|The <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> {{of trade}} in the Norwegian grocery market are claimed to differ {{substantially}} between the market participants at retail level. Also, the cost of goods sold constitutes the most {{significant part of the}} total costs of the firms. Consequently, the <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> of trade that a market participant is able to obtain are considered to have significant impact on its competitiveness. Building on the statements of Ica that their <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> are substantially worse than those of its competitors and that without improvements they would have to withdraw from the market, this paper aims at understanding how <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> of trade influence competitiveness at retail level in the Norwegian grocery market. Coop’s recent acquisition of Ica increases the relevance of the research. The research question is answered using a theoretical basis of vertical restraints and buyer power applied on a case study of the Norwegian grocery market with regards to <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> of trade used in the market. The main findings of the paper are that differences in <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> of trade to a certain extent make it difficult for market participants to compete. However, the paper concludes that there are also other factors that affect competitiveness. The conclusions are drawn based on a margin analysis conducted for all four market participants. The analysis shows that Ica has worsened its <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> of trade over the investigated time period, which have made it harder for them to compete. However, Reitangruppen is also found to experience a worsening of its <b>terms</b> <b>and</b> <b>conditions</b> of trade but the firm has still improved its profitability and competitiveness. nhhma...|$|R
