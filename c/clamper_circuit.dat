50|$|During {{the first}} {{negative}} {{phase of the}} AC input voltage, the capacitor in a positive <b>clamper</b> <b>circuit</b> charges rapidly. As Vin becomes positive, the capacitor serves as a voltage doubler; since it has stored the equivalent of Vin during the negative cycle, it provides nearly that voltage during the positive cycle. This essentially doubles the voltage seen by the load. As Vin becomes negative, the capacitor acts as a battery of the same voltage of Vin. The voltage source and the capacitor counteract each other, resulting in a net voltage of zero as seen by the load.|$|E
50|$|In {{general the}} clamper {{includes}} a capacitor, {{followed by a}} diode in parallel with the load. The <b>clamper</b> <b>circuit</b> relies on {{a change in the}} capacitor's time constant which {{is the result of the}} diode changing the current path of the capacitor with the changing polarity of the AC input voltage. The magnitude of R and C are chosen so that the time constant, , is large enough to ensure that the voltage across the capacitor does not discharge significantly during the diode's non-conducting interval. However this kind of discharge only happens when the load resistor is very big, which takes the capacitor a lot of time to discharge, and can be ignored at high frequencies. On the other hand, the capacitor is chosen small enough to allow it to charge quickly during the diode's conducting interval. At the same time, the AC supply voltage frequency should be chosen low enough for the capacitor to fully charge in one quarter of a cycle.|$|E
40|$|A single-switch fully-controlled {{three-phase}} rectifier is presented, {{which provides}} high AC power factor and wide DC voltage regulation while allowing high-frequency insulation. Owing to one-cycle control, output voltage ripple is also eliminated. Moreover, switch voltage stress {{is limited by}} a lossless <b>clamper</b> <b>circuit,</b> resulting in safe operation and high efficiency...|$|E
40|$|A low cost, highly rectifying, nano {{heterojunction}} (p-ZnO/n-Si) diode was fabricated using solution-processed, p-type, ZnO nanoparticles and an n-type Si substrate. p-type ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized using {{a chemical}} synthesis route and characterized by XRD and a Hall effect measurement system. The device was fabricated by forming thin film of synthesized p-ZnO nanoparticles on an n-Si substrate using a dip coating technique. The device was then characterized by current–voltage (I – V) and capacitance–voltage (C – V) measurements. The effect of UV illumination on the I – V characteristics was also explored and indicated {{the formation of}} a highly rectifying, nano heterojunction with a rectification ratio of 101 at 3 V, which increased nearly 2. 5 times (232 at 3 V) under UV illumination. However, the cut-in voltage decreases from 1. 5 V to 0. 9 V under UV illumination. The fabricated device could be used in switches, rectifiers, clipper and <b>clamper</b> <b>circuits,</b> BJTs, MOSFETs and other electronic circuitry...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{high-performance}} high-frequency-link (HFL) single-phase inverter. It offers bidirectional two-stage galvanic isolation power conversion without bulky dc link capacitors. An active <b>clamper</b> <b>circuit</b> and corresponding modulation strategy is developed {{to enable the}} proposed HFL rectifier to operate in soft-switching modes and be free of voltage spikes during device commutation. A succinct circuit model and high-performance plug-in repetitive control scheme are also developed to enable it to equally function as a high-performance conventional pulse width modulation (PWM) inverter. The experiment results on a 20 -kHz HFL inverter prototype demonstrate {{the efficacy of the}} soft-switching HFL inverter and its highly promising control performance. The proposed HFL inverter offers a high-reliability, high-efficiency, high-power-density, and high-performance power conversion solution to extensive applications...|$|E
40|$|Machine {{learning}} {{methods are}} an excellent way for understanding the neural basis of human decision making. Some machine learning systems try to eradicate the need for human intuition in data analysis whereas others embrace a collective approach between humans and machines. The objective of this project is to collect Electroencephalography (EEG) signals through wireless sensors, and the process the collected signals through machine learning methods. The EEG data is collected using three EEG electrodes, each being the positive, negative and ground terminals respectively. Since the signal measures in the unit of micro-volts {{it needs to be}} amplified using amplifier circuit. This circuit consists of five stages, namely, the Instrumentation Amplifier, 60 Hz Notch Filter, 31 Hz Low Pass Filter, Gain Stage, and <b>Clamper</b> <b>Circuit.</b> Each of these stages contribute in their own way to amplify and also filter the noise from the EEG signal. The gain of the entire circuit is about 5140 V/V. The EEG signal is observed on the cathode-ray oscilloscope and the data is collected on an Arduino Uno microcontroller using the Hyperterminal software. The data is sampled at a sampling rate of 838 Hz. Any remaining noise from the signal can be removed by passing it through a digital low-pass filter, if required. EEG data is collected from 10 people while they are made to concentrate on a particular thought. The subjects were asked to imagine moving an object towards the direction 2 ̆ 6 lsquoRight 2 ̆ 6 rsquo for the first 150 data sets collected and then the same for the direction 2 ̆ 6 lsquoLeft 2 ̆ 6 rsquo for another 150 data sets. All the data was collected with complete supervision and without any kind of movement of the subject during the collection process. This part of this data was then used to design a Machine Learning model called Support Vector Machine (SVM) on Matlab, using which the data was then processed. The data was divided into two sets, namely. The training data, and testing data. One-third of the total data sets is used for training the SVM model and then the rest of the data sets are used to test the accuracy of the model. Data from the 10 individuals is processed individually and also after being mixed. The SVM model randomly selects the training and testing data and accordingly gives results for the accuracy. Finally, results for the individual data and mixed data are tabulated and presented in the following thesis...|$|E
