50|$|In forestry, {{periodic}} annual increment (PAI) is {{the change}} in the size of a tree between the beginning and ending of a growth period, divided by the number of years that was designated as the growing period. For sigmoid growth, the graph of PAI increases rapidly and then quickly declines, approaching zero. PAI may go negative if a tree loses volume due to damage or disease. Periodic annual increment is commonly used instead of <b>current</b> <b>annual</b> <b>increment</b> as a basis for computing growth per cent. Growth per cent indicates the rate of increase with relation to the wood capital required for its production, this is usually based on a single year's growth.|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the <b>current</b> <b>annual</b> <b>increment</b> of forest standing volume (CAI) is a fundamental tool to support forest management and planning. A suitable approach to such an end is to rely on growth and yield models. However, this kind of models are often not available for many countries and/or locations and/or species. Furthermore, they may become obsolete due to potential changes in the environmental and silvicultural conditions. Such shortcomings may be distinctively detrimental {{in the context of}} forest inventories. Several methods have been proposed to inventory CAI on one single occasion, i. e., when repeated measurements of standing volume are not available. A wellknown family of methods, still largely exploited in Alpine and Eastern European countries, derives from the estimation of the percentage <b>current</b> <b>annual</b> <b>increment</b> of forest standing volume by the current annual increments of stem diameter and tree height (Δh). In this study an experimental comparison of Δh assessment by three different approaches is presented with reference to a properly designed case study: (i) Δh is measured on felled trees; (ii) Δh is estimated by dynamic height curve (i. e., diameter-height-age model); (iii) Δh is estimated by conventional height curve (i. e., diameter-height model). Under the examined experimental conditions (a pure forest of silver fir on highly fertile soils in southern Italy, aged around 60 years), both simplified approaches (ii) and (iii) have proven to underestimate height increments, with a larger underestimation by the approach based on the conventional height curve. However, the consequent error in the estimation of percentage <b>current</b> <b>annual</b> <b>increment</b> of forest standing volume has proved to be quite limited (4 % for the approach based on the dynamic height curve and around 9 % for the approach based on the conventional height curve). Hence, such simplified approaches may be rather safely considered for estimating percentage <b>current</b> <b>annual</b> <b>increment</b> of forest standing volume when neither Δh is directly detectable on standing trees nor sample trees can be felled, nor an appropriate model to predict Δh is available. The Δh estimation on the conventional height curve should turn out to be even more suitable in the case of uneven-aged stands, where the position of the height curve remains stationary over time.

40|$|Recent {{papers have}} {{demonstrated}} the applicability of a calibrated bio-geochemical model – BIOME-BGC - for estimating <b>current</b> <b>annual</b> <b>increments</b> (CAIs) of Mediterranean forests. In this study, the above model is applied to assess the gross primary production (GPP) of nine beech forest sites in Italy using a previously produced data set of meteorological data over a ten-year period (1999 - 2008). The obtained GPP estimates are integrated with relevant autotrophic respiration and allocation to obtain forest net primary production (NPP) averages for the same forests. The simulations are performed assuming different levels of ecosystem disequilibrium, i. e., progressively {{taking into account the}} effects of specific site history in terms of woody biomass removal and stand aging. The NPP estimates, converted into CAIs by means of specific coefficients, are validated through comparison with data derived from tree growth measurements. Results indicate that the modeling of quasi-equilibrium conditions tends to produce overestimated CAI values, particularly for not fully stocked, old stands. The inclusion of information on existing biomass leads to a partial improvement, while optimal results are obtained when information on ecosystem development phase is considered. The implications of using different NPP estimation methods are finally discussed in the perspective of assessing the forest carbon budget on a national basis.

Logical estimates of branch productivity including: branch foliage dry weight, current extension length of the primary branch axis, and the <b>current</b> <b>annual</b> xylem <b>increment</b> measured as ring width at branch base (CAXI-branch base); were related to wood growth on the tree bole. CAXI-branch base was hypothesized {{to be the best}} single indicator of a branch's contribution to bolewood growth. This parameter was incorporated into a crown vigor index (CVI) designed to simulate vertically distributed bolewood increment. CVI was also related to other similar bole growth simulation models. No clear correspondence was found between the vertical distribution of the <b>annual</b> bolewood <b>increment</b> and the branch parameters: foliage dry weight, current extension length of the primary branch axis, and CAXI-branch base. The regularity of these branch parameter measurements throughout the tree crown compared to a well defined bolewood increment pattern suggested, however, that an indirect relationship between the two existed. The incorporation of CAXI-branch base into the crown vigor index made it possible to statistically relate this branch parameter to actual bolewood increment. CVI bole growth simulations, in general, corresponded closely to bolewood increment values. Notable exceptions occured on trees with anomalous growth patterns and at points of localized bending stress. CVI bole growth simulations proved to be superior to other bole growth models of similar construction. The technique for measuring CAXI-branch base is a destructive process which is complex and tedious. A practical modification to the CVI model was to estimate CAXI-branch base from readily obtainable branch parameters.

Stands with uniform structure (trees in plots planted in a single day) showed 13 % greater growth than stands with higher heterogeneity of tree sizes (owing to a staggered planting time of up to 80 days).

Don. and to describe the probability distribution in stands stablished at the municipality of Rio Negro, Paraná State. Twenty trees were sampled in a 34 years-old stand, with 3 m x 2 m spacing. Wood disks were taken from each tree at  1. 3 m above the ground (DBH) to perform partial stem analysis. Diameter growth series without bark were used to generate the average cumulative growth curves for DBH (cm), mean annual increment (MAI) and <b>current</b> <b>annual</b> <b>increment</b> (CAI). From the increment data, the frequency distribution was evaluated by means of probability density functions (pdfs). The mean annual increment for DBH was 0. 78 cm year- 1 {{and the age of}} intersection of CAI and MAI curves was between the 7 th and 8 th years. It was found that near 43 % of the species increments are concentrated bellow 0. 5 cm. The results are useful to define appropriate management strategies for the species for sites similar to the studying regions, defining for example ages of silvicultural intervention, such as thinning...|$|E
40|$|This {{work had}} as {{objectives}} {{the study of}} the growth in DBH, commercial volume, average of annual increment in percentage of the commercial volume and the determination of the commercial form factor for Cordia trichotoma (Vell.) Arrab. ex steud., in the Central Depression of the Rio Grande do Sul State. The growth data were tested with three mathematical equations, for the adjustment of diameter and commercial volume without bark. The Backman equation resulted as the most efficient model, adjusted in function of the age of the trees. This equation also was selected for the adjustment of the average annual increment in percentage of the commercial volume, adjusted in function of DBH. For the commercial form factor the best equation was the quadratic and the values were determined in function of the DBH to facilitate the practical application. The commercial form factor varied from 0, 34 for a DBH of 7 cm to a maximum value of 0, 78 for a DBH around 37, 1 cm, at the ages of 20 and 88 years respectively. The <b>current</b> <b>annual</b> <b>increment</b> in percentage of the commercial volume varied from 18, 05...|$|E
30|$|The {{slope of}} the linear {{relationship}} between LAI and IVG, growth efficiency, represents the efficiency of captured light and its conversion into annual stand growth (<b>current</b> <b>annual</b> <b>increment</b> or CAI) per unit of leaf area. Results of our study show a slope of 5.2  m 3  ha− 1 per unit of LAI, which is within the range reported by Rubilar et al. (2013) for younger unthinned stands and under the mean value reported by Alvarez et al. (2013) for older unthinned stands showing larger growth rates. Changes in the slope between LAI and CAI indicate differences in growth efficiency (GE) among stands. Increases in water and nutrient availability have shown increases in GE for radiata pine (Linder et al. 1987; Raison and Myers 1992). Rubilar et al. (2013) presented large differences in GE in radiata pine between low fertility dry sands and medium fertility red clay sites sustaining similar leaf area levels for younger stands. Sites in our study did not show nutritional limitations or low fertilities that affect growing trees, although the water gradient of the sites could {{have an impact on}} nutrients uptake. However, and despite the large water gradient considered in our study, {{we were not able to}} observe differences in GE among stands.|$|E

The biological rotation age is the age in which a stand should be harvested to maximize long-term yield.|$|R

40|$|Central Amazonian {{floodplain}} forests near Manaus can {{be divided}} into two ecosystems, according to the principal flooding water types. Whitewater floodplains (várzea) have soils with high, blackwaters (igapó) with low nutrient content. Differences in wood specific gravities and <b>annual</b> <b>increments</b> were investigated in 30 tree species in várzea and 35 species in igapó. In várzea, trees had lower wood specific gravities and higher <b>annual</b> wood <b>increments</b> than in igapó. Elevation and flood duration showed no significant influences on wood specific gravities in both ecosystems. Pioneer species of whitewater floodplains had significantly lower mean wood specific gravities and higher <b>annual</b> <b>increments</b> than non-pioneer species. Intraspecifically, two of four species occurring in both systems showed significantly higher wood specific gravity and lower <b>annual</b> <b>increments</b> in blackwater than in whitewater floodplains. The significant differences in wood specific gravity and <b>annual</b> <b>increments</b> in the whitewater and blackwater floodplain systems suggest that the type of flooding water and the related nutrient input may directly affect tree growth. Slow growth in blackwater floodplain forests can be considered as an adaptation to the low nutrient status of the system and an efficient utilization of the available nutrients...|$|R
