40|$|The present paper {{present a}} study done on the Human Resources in Science and Technology (HRST) in Research Development and Innovation (RDI) sector in Romania during 1993 - 2009. This paper started from the {{elements}} defined in <b>Canberra</b> <b>Manual</b> based on the qualification and occupation. Labor force in this study refers to university level and technician level as skill from education. These definitions from <b>Canberra</b> <b>Manual</b> for HRST {{were used in the}} present paper in reference to all the researchers in Romania for different areas of research as engineering and technology sciences domains, natural and exact sciences, medical sciences, agricultural science, social sciences and humanities. After a short presentation of the US origin of the Human Resources in Science and Technology Management and the situation from Europe, the present paper are dealing with the area of the Human Resources in Science and Technology system from Romania, the sector of Research Development and Innovation. This study is focused on the employees by categories of the activities in research, development and innovation sector. We took into account the employees with different categories of graduation diploma which are working in the fields of research and development activities too. Samples data were took from Tempo online database from National Institute of Statistics from Romania, updated database in 21 of October in 2010. Data were took for simulations in December 2010. We try to do a simulation on the evolution of Human Resources in Science and Technology (HRST) in Research Development and Innovation (RDI) sector in Romania during this period (1993 - 2009) and we observed that real data fitting on a regression curve of sixth degree whose coefficients were defined during this study. This type of simulation can be good for future forecasting for Human Resources in Science and Technology in Research Development and Innovation (RDI) sector in Romania. The present study is part of Doctoral Grant 誰多 1 / 2 Implications for innovation and research and development {{role in the development of}} Romania's economic competitiveness誰多 1 / 2, during 2010 and 2013 and having Director :Prof. Dr. Alina Badulescu in Oradea University, Faculty of Economic Sciences. Human Resources, Human Development, Statistical Simulation Methods, Employment, Higher Education and Research Institutions, Labor Force and Employment, Size, and Structure. ...|$|E
40|$|Scientific {{indicators}} {{arise from}} the measurement of inputs and results of the scientific institution. Scientometrics develops methodologies for set up those indicators based on interdisplinary technics from the economics, statistics, management and documentation. The methodologies that are internationally accepted (Frascati Manual, Oslo Manual and <b>Canberra</b> <b>Manual)</b> constitute the classical references to measure the econocmic inputs and results, {{as well as the}} technological results of the research and development. However, there is no international consensus about how to measure and evaluate intellectual and academic production in the ways in which it is expressed in the editorial system, either in the interpretation of its impacts e influences. Defining bibliometrics, scientometrics and infometrics, as well as their scope and application, this paper presents alternative views to interpret current scientometric indicators, which greatly outcome from compilation of the Citation Index, published by the Institute for Scientific Information, and other similar databases. Particularly, an hypothesis is presented aiming at explaining the bias of the Citation Index in favour of the publications that belong to the mainstream of the developed countries, against those publications of similar quality published by Third World countries...|$|E
