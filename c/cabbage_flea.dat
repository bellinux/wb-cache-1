40|$|The {{literary}} part of {{the thesis}} describes biology, economic importance and methods of chemical protection against pollen beetle, cabbage seed weevil and <b>cabbage</b> stem <b>flea</b> beetle. The resistance of these pests against zoocides in the Czech republic and {{in some parts of}} neighbour European countries is decribed and principles of antiresistance strategies are outlined. Each group of insecticides is describd and their active components are rated in the practical {{part of the}} thesis. Findings about pest resistance are summarized - resistance types and mechanisms in particular. Then monitoring of resistent populations of plant pests are described. New findings concerning the resistance of three oilseed rape pests were acquired using biological methods. For cabage seed weevil six areas were evaluated, for pollen beetle seven and for <b>cabbage</b> stem <b>flea</b> beetle two areas were evaluated. All the evaluated areas are in the Czech republic. The adult-vial test number 11, nr. 25, nr. 27 accordinng to IRAC methodology and topical aplication test were used to rate the resistance. The efficiency of five pyrethroids (deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, esfenvalerate, etofenprox, tau-fluvalinate, cypermethrin), one organophosphate (chlorpyrifos - <b>cabbage</b> stem <b>flea</b> beetle only) and one oxadiazin (indoxacarb) in different concentrations were rated. The mortality of the pests was rated 24 hours after active component functioning for pollen beetle and cabbage seed weevil and after 48 hours for cabage stem flea beetle. Then lethal concentration LC 50 and LC 95 values were assessed. For ppollen beetle, the resistance against pyrethroids was confirmed with the exception, the effect of neonicotinoids was variable, acetamiprid and thiacloprid showed reduced efficiency in populations of some areas.

40|$|Many organic farmers {{hesitate}} to grow winter oilseed rape (WOSR), despite its usefulness for crop rotations and animal fodder, {{because it is}} attacked by many insects, which are difficult to control without chemical treatments. In a geographically broad network of farmer’s fields, we analysed the effect of various crop management factors and of the surrounding field environment on a large range of insects known to damage WOSR: root maggot (Delia radicum L.), <b>cabbage</b> stem <b>flea</b> beetle (Psylliodes chrysocephala L.), rape stem weevil (Ceuthorhynchus napi Gyl) and pollen beetle (Meligethes aeneus F.). Our results confirm the effect of sowing date, plant density and soil tillage regime on root maggot attacks and <b>cabbage</b> stem <b>flea</b> beetle larva infestation. Early sowing tended to increase root maggot damage whereas it {{was associated with a}} lower level of attack of <b>cabbage</b> stem <b>flea</b> beetle. High plant density tended to decrease the damage or the attack of all insects. We show that nitrogen availability in the soil affect <b>cabbage</b> stem <b>flea</b> beetle, stem weevil levels and pollen beetle damage: the negative effect of soil nitrogen content on pollen beetle damage {{may be related to the}} significant effect of nitrogen on plant vigour and, therefore, to the compensation of pollen beetle damage on new racemes. If all insects were considered together, the proportion of land under WOSR in the region and the surrounding environment had a significant effect on pest occurrence. In regions with a high proportion of land under WOSR, the proportion of plants attacked by root maggot and pollen beetle tended to increase. Conversely, regions with high proportions of land under WOSR tended to have a smaller proportion of plants with <b>cabbage</b> stem <b>flea</b> beetle larvae or damage, whatever the environment surrounding the field. For almost all the pests considered, the fields displaying the most severe pest attacks in regions with more than 1. 2 % WOSR were bounded by trees, hedges and bushes. Conversely, in regions with a lower percentage of land under WOSR, woodland around the field reduced the occurrence of pest attack...|$|R
40|$|European Union (EU) {{has banned}} {{the use of}} three pesticides: clothianidin, {{thiamethoxam}} and imidacloprid in bee attractive crops. These pesticides all belong to a pesticide group called neonicotinoids, and they {{are believed to be}} a contributing factor in the declining bee population. The ban was enforced in EU the 1 st of December 2013. Neonicotinoids (clothianidin and thiamethoxam) {{are an important part of}} the control of pests in oilseed rape production in Danish agriculture. The neonicotinoids are generally used as a seed treatment in oilseed rape. The coatings of the rape seeds prevent young plants from pest attack. The seed treatment of oilseed rape helps controlling <b>Cabbage</b> stem <b>flea</b> beetle (Psylliodes chrysocephala). The lack of seed treatment in oilseed rape could result in extra treatments with pyrethroids (lambda-cyhalothrin, Gamma cyhalothrin and Cypermethrin). 	 This project aims to identify if the banning of the three neonicotinoids (clothianidin, thamethoxam and imidacloprid), seems to result in a farming practice that puts more or less pressure on the Danish environment, with special emphasis on honey bees. In Denmark there has not been reported poisoning of honey bees from either pyrethroids or neonicotinoids. Pesticides are among the Danish apiculturist not seen as a major concern, which indicates little identified negative effect of the neonicotinoids on honey bees. When treatment with neonicotinoids in oilseed rape is substituted with a treatment with pyrethroids, the time of application should pose no threat to honey bees, as the crop are not flowering and the application period will be in the autumn, where few flowers are present in the Danish environment. 	The change in oilseed farming practice does not necessarily increase the load on the Danish environment (based on calculation of Area Load). If the Danish farmers substitute the neonicotinoids seed treatment with an extra treatment of the pyrethroid with the least Area Load (Karate WG (Lambda-cyhalothrin)). If Danish farmers based on the higher taxation, in the future solely will use Karate WG in oilseed rape, the Area Load can actually decrease compared to before the ban of neonicotinoids even with three applications. Findings of resistance in <b>Cabbage</b> stem <b>flea</b> beetle in Germany towards pyrethroids makes a plausible scenario being breakdown of control of this pest in oilseed rape. Previously the control of <b>Cabbage</b> stem <b>flea</b> beetle has been based on neonicotinoids and pyrethroids, which have different modes of action in <b>Cabbage</b> stem <b>flea</b> beetle. Resistance among <b>Cabbage</b> stem <b>flea</b> beetle towards pyrethroids would result in the need of stronger doses and more applications, which would give rise to higher load on the environment including bees (increase in AL).

The immature stages (egg, three larval stages, prepupal and pupal stage) are soil inhabitants. The adult is bluish black and two to three millimeters in length. P. cruciferae was found to be univoltine in western Oregon, with the adults of the annual generation apparently overwintering in a state of reproductive diapause.

"Monida"), common vetch (Vicia sativa L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), annual ryegrass (Lolium multflorum Lam.), and buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) was broadcast over established broccoli (Brassica oleracea L.) 32 days after planting. The broccoli was planted, under-sown, and harvested in sections alternated with strips of cover crop. The cover crop relay provided tillage and pesticide refuges for beneficial insects without taking land out of broccoli production. Relay strip-cropping increased the abundance {{and diversity of}} ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae), spiders (Araneae), harvestmen (Opiliones: Phalangiidae), lady beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and damsel bugs (Heteroptera: Nabidae) in the cropping system; however, this did not always result in increased natural enemies in the broccoli. Arthropod species varied significantly in their propensity to leave the non-crop vegetation and move into the broccoli. Movement of the lady beetle Coccinella septempunctata L. from the cover crop strips into the broccoli may have depressed aphid populations in 1996. The non-crop vegetation may {{have served as a}} sink rather than a source for Nabis species and appeared to reduce their density in the broccoli growing nearby. There was no evidence that background vegetation surrounding the broccoli reduced colonization by winged aphids. The density of the <b>cabbage</b> <b>flea</b> beetle Phyllotreta crucferae Goeze was lower in the broccoli relay compared with the clean-tilled broccoli. The number of third instar imported cabbage worm Pieris rapae (L.) and cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni (Hubner) was reduced on broccoli leaves and harvested buds in the relay strip-cropping system compared with the clean-tilled system. The number of diamondback moth Plutella xylostella (L.) pupae was higher in the clean-tilled broccoli; percent parasitism of the pupae was similar in the two cropping systems.

40|$|Oilseed rape (Brassica napus) is an {{important}} combinable break crop in the UK, which is largely protected from arthropod pests by insecticidal chemicals. Despite ongoing debate {{regarding the use of}} neonicotinoids, the dominant seed treatment ingredients used for this crop, there is little publicly available data comparing the efficacy of insecticides in controlling key arthropod pests or comparing the impacts on non-target species and the wider environment. To provide an insight into these matters, a UK-wide expert survey targeting agronomists and entomologists was conducted from March to June 2015. Based on the opinions of 90 respondents, an average of 20 % yield loss caused by the key arthropod pests was expected to have occurred in the absence of insecticide treatments. Relatively older chemical groups were perceived to have lower efficacy for target pests than newer ones, partly due to the development of insecticide resistance. Without neonicotinoid seed treatments, a lack of good control for <b>cabbage</b> stem <b>flea</b> beetle was perceived. Wide spectrum foliar insecticide sprays were perceived to have significantly greater negative impacts than seed treatments on users' health, natural enemies, pollinators, soil and water, and many foliar active ingredients have had potential risks for non-target arthropod species in UK oilseed rape fields for the past 25 years. Overall, 72 % of respondents opposed the neonicotinoid restriction, while 10 % supported it. Opposition and support of the restriction were largely based on concerns for pollinators and the wider environment, highlighting the uncertainty over the side effects of neonicotinoid use. More people from the government and research institutes leaned towards neutrality over the issue, compared to those directly involved in growing the crop.

Pre-treatment with PBO, prior to exposure to λ-cyhalothrin suggested involvement of metabolic resistance in UK samples. Danish samples were mostly susceptible with very low resistance ratios, while most other samples showed reduced sensitivity in varying degrees. Likewise, there was a clear difference in the presence of the kdr mutation between the three countries. In the UK, the presence of kdr genotypes did not always correlate well with resistant phenotypes. This appears to be primarily conferred by a yet undisclosed, metabolic-based mechanism.

The vial bioassay methodology was adapted to thiacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide, to determine baseline susceptibility and to provide a methodology to allow long-term susceptibility monitoring of pollen beetle and cabbage seed weevil. Thiacloprid monitoring revealed that pollen beetle and cabbage seed weevil populations collected across Europe in 2009 - 2012 and 2012 respectively were highly susceptible to this insecticide class. Metabolism studies using native microsomal preparations as the enzyme source and deltamethrin as substrate revealed metabolism of deltamethrin with 4 -OH-deltamethrin being the major metabolite. Metabolite formation in vitro was correlated with the observed pyrethroid resistance level in vivo and was suppressible by PBO. A degenerate PCR approach was used to identify partial P 450 gene sequences from pollen beetle. qRT-PCR screening covering a range of pollen beetle populations differing in levels of pyrethroid resistance identified a single P 450, CYP 6 BQ 23, as significantly and highly overexpressed (up to ~ 900 -fold) in resistant strains compared to susceptible strains. The expression of CYP 6 BQ 23 was significantly correlated with both the level of resistance and with the rate of deltamethrin metabolism in microsomal preparations of these populations. Recombinant expression of this P 450 in an insect cell line demonstrated that it is capable of hydroxylating deltamethrin and tau-fluvalinate. The turnover of these pyrethroids by CYP 6 BQ 23 is in line with the observed moderate cross-resistant phenotype. Molecular modeling suggested a better fit of deltamethrin into the active site of CYP 6 BQ 23 compared to tau-fluvalinate also supporting the biochemical results. The occurrence of target-site resistance was investigated by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of the para-locus encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) in insects. To achieve this goal a partial fragment (domain IIS 4 - 6) encoding an important region of the pyrethroid binding site was PCR amplified and screened for non-synonymous SNPs. One SNP was identified causing a leucine to phenylalanine substitution at amino acid residue number 1014 (Musca domestica L. numbering), well known as knock down resistance (kdr) conferring an absolute cross-resistance to pyrethroids and DDT in various insect species. Sequencing of the very same gene region in the <b>cabbage</b> stem <b>flea</b> beetle also revealed the presence of the L 1014 F kdr mutation in pyrethroid resistant flea beetle populations, thus explaining the strong cross-resistance pattern observed in vitro. Most mechanistic studies of resistance have focused on elucidating the contribution of particular genes/gene families to pyrethroid resistance. To generate a comprehensive sequence resource and to elucidate global changes in gene regulation related to insecticide resistance in pollen beetle a de novo transcriptome was assembled from sequence pools generated by next-generation sequencing. RNA-sequencing of three pyrethroid resistant and one highly susceptible reference population allowed a global gene expression analysis by short read mapping against the generated transcriptome, as well as a SNP analysis. The implications of these results for resistance management in coleopteran pests in winter oilseed rape and opportunities for future work are discussed. Der Winterraps, Brassica napus L., hat sich in Europa zu einem festen Bestandteil der maßgeblich von Getreide dominierten Fruchtfolgen entwickelt. Winterraps wird von einer Vielzahl an Schädlingen befallen welche in der Praxis fast ausschließlich durch den Einsatz von chemischen Insektiziden (maßgeblich Pyrethroide) bekämpft werden. Der seit mehr als 20 Jahren wiederkehrende Einsatz von Pyrethroiden zur Kontrolle von Rapsschädlingen in Europa resultierte in einem enormen Selektionsdruck. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist es nicht verwunderlich, dass drei Schädlinge der Ordnung Coleoptera gegenwärtig eine Resistenz gegen Pyrethroide aufweisen. Bei den drei coleopteren Vertretern handelt es sich um den Rapsglanzkäfer, Meligethes aeneus F., den Rapserdfloh, Psylliodes chrysocephala L. und den Kohlschotenrüssler, Ceutorhynchus assimilis PAYK [...] Mittels einem auf insektizidbeschichteten Glasröhrchen beruhenden Biotestsystem (adult vial tests) wurde die Ausprägung (Stärke und Kreuzresistenzmuster) sowie die geographische Verteilung der Pyrethroidresistenz bei Rapsglanzkäfern und Rapserdflöhen untersucht. Unter Verwendung des identischen Testsystems wurde die Baseline Susceptibility (Ausgangsempfindlichkeit) von Kohlschotenrüsseler gegen lambda-Cyhalothrin erfasst. Unter Verwendung von Thiacloprid, ein Wirkstoff der chemischen Klasse der Neonikotinoide, im Glasröhrchen Testsystem wurde die Baseline Susceptibility vom Rapsglanzkäfer und Kohlschotenrüssler erfasst. Der Metabolismus von Deltamethrin durch native mikrosomale Membranpräparationen des Rapsglanzkäfers wurde untersucht. Die Metabolismusrate von Deltamethrin zu 4 -OH-Deltamethrin in vitro war mit der erfassten Pyrethroidresistenz in vivo positiv korreliert und konnte mit PBO inhibiert werden. Mit einer PCR Strategie basierend auf degenerierten Oligonukleotiden wurden Genfragmente der P 450 Genfamilie aus Rapsglanzkäfern isoliert und deren Expression mittels qRT-PCR in Populationen mit verschiedenen Resistenzausprägungen quantifiziert. CYP 6 BQ 23 war in resistenten Populationen signifikant hochreguliert. Die Überexpression war signifikant korreliert mit der Resistenzausprägung in vivo und der Umsetzung von Deltamethrin in vitro. CYP 6 BQ 23 wurde in einer Insektenzellkultur rekombinant funktionell exprimiert und der CYP 6 BQ 23 abhängige Deltamethrinmetabolismus bewiesen. Darüber hinaus wurde gezeigt, dass CYP 6 BQ 23 auch tau-Fluvalinat umsetzt. Mithilfe eines Computermodels von CYP 6 BQ 23 wurde die Substratbindung simuliert und eine bessere Bindung für Deltamethrin im Vergleich zu tau-Fluvalinat prognostiziert. Der Einfluss von wirkortspezifischer Resistenz (target-site resistance) wurde ebenfalls untersucht. Vom para-locus, welcher den spannungsabhängigen Natriumkanal im zentralen Nervensystem der Insekten kodiert, wurde ein Genfragment (Domäne IIS 4 - 6) PCR-amplifiziert, sequenziert und auf Einzelnukleotidpolimorphismen (SNPs) untersucht. Ein SNP wurde identifiziert der in einem Aminosäureaustausch von Leucin zu Phenylalanin an Positon 1014 (Musca domestica L. Nummerierung) resultiert. Diese Mutation ist in einer Vielzahl von Insekten als knock down resistance (kdr) beschrieben und vermittelt eine Kreuzresistenz gegenüber Pyrethroiden und DDT. Im Rapserdfloh wurde die gleiche Region im orthologen Locus untersucht mit dem identischen Befund. Die L 1014 F kdr Mutation im Rapserdfloh ist korreliert mit Bekämpfungsproblemen von Rapserdflöhen beim Einsatz von Pyrethroiden. In den meisten Studien zur Aufklärung von Resistenzmechnismen wurde der Fokus auf eine spezielle Enzym-/Genfamilie gelegt. Um einen holistischeren Weg zu gehen wurde eine Transkriptomstudie beim Rapsglanzkäfer durchgeführt. Ziel war das Assemblieren des de novo Transkriptoms, die Isolierung von Genen die insektizide Wirkorte kodieren und deren Analyse auf SNPs sowie eine komparative Analyse der Genregulierung zwischen pyrethroidresistenten und sensitiven Populationen. Die Konsequenzen der Ergebnisse für ein nachhaltiges Resistenzmanagement in coleopteren Schädlingen in Winterraps and die Möglichkeiten für weiterführende Studien werden diskutiert...|$|R
40|$|In 1997 approx. 25 ac. of {{cauliflower}} were {{harvested in}} Minnesota. Another 700 acres of related crucifer crops, including cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and Chinese cabbage (e. g., bok choi, nappa, etc.) are also produced annually in Minnesota, {{most of which}} is sold for fresh market. Cabbage and broccoli are covered in separate crop profiles for Minnesota. Despite the relatively few acres of cauliflower in the state, the high value of the crop (ca. $ 4, 100 /ac), and traditionally high insecticide use of about 5 - 6 sprays/ season, continues to create a demand for effective integrated pest management (IPM) programs. In response to new IPM information needs generated by the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA), this crop profile was developed to a) summarize current IPM practices for insect, disease and weed pests, b) highlight pesticides under review by US-EPA, c) estimate {{the impact of the}} loss of selected pesticides, and d) assess alternatives for such losses. In most years, insect pests are usually the most damaging and difficult to control in Minnesota The Crop Profile/PMSP database, including this document, is supported by USDA NIFA. cauliflower. The most important insect pests include: cabbage looper, imported cabbageworm, diamondback moth, <b>cabbage</b> maggot and <b>flea</b> beetles. Diamondback moth larvae are especially critical because of their rather cryptic feeding behavior in the head and maximum size of < inch. Even wit...|$|R
