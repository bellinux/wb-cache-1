In addition, it has been forcefully argued that since the Attorney-General is the principal legal advisor of the executive, it is overly idealistic to expect his <b>consent</b> <b>to</b> an action against the Government.

40|$|Background: The {{concept of}} valid consent has become {{important}} for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). However, many patients {{feel that they}} do not have enough information before consenting and a significant minority feel coerced into consenting. Little is known about what factors account for these views. Aim: To explore patients' perceptions about how they <b>consented</b> <b>to</b> ECT. Method: Twelve participants were interviewed about their experiences of <b>consenting</b> <b>to</b> ECT. Interviews were subjected to a thematic analysis. Results: Participants' perceptions of <b>consenting</b> <b>to</b> ECT were complex, and interpersonal factors were found to be important. Many participants felt that they had consented without adequate information from medical sources and that they had little choice to agree. Two participants <b>consented</b> <b>to</b> ECT as either a form of self-harm or hoping it would kill them. Conclusion: <b>Consenting</b> <b>to</b> ECT is more complex than currently recognised and involves interpersonal and systemic factors. As a result, people may consent because they feel that they have little choice. Implications for practice are discussed...|$|R
