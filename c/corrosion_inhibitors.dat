25|$|In {{the absence}} of leaks, {{antifreeze}} chemicals such as ethylene glycol or propylene glycol may retain their basic properties indefinitely. By contrast, <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are gradually used up, and must be replenished from time to time. Larger systems (such as HVAC systems) are often monitored by specialist firms which take responsibility for adding <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and regulating coolant composition. For simplicity, most automotive manufacturers recommend periodic complete replacement of engine coolant, to simultaneously renew <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and remove accumulated contaminants.|$|E

25|$|This {{reciprocal}} process effectively fuels corrosion until {{either the}} metal is eaten away or {{the concentration of}} CH3OH is negligible. Methanol's corrosivity has been addressed with methanol-compatible materials and fuel additives that serve as <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors.</b>|$|E
30|$|The optical {{profiler}} {{was also}} {{used to compare the}} oil-soluble <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (CIC) and water-based <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (CID) studied earlier by Yang et al. (2007). It was found in this work that the water-dispersible <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (CID) had better film persistency than the equivalent oil-based <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (CIC) in field tests. It was also found that the water-dispersible <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (CID) has several orders of magnitude more droplets in brine. In our work, we have found that the water-dispersible <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (CID) has a thicker and more uniform film (6.7  μm) than the oil-based <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (CIC) where the <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> film varies between 3.9 and 5.7  μm after a 24 -h WB tests.|$|R

The <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> mitigates or eliminates corrosion {{on the surface}} of a substrate upon which the <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> is applied. In addition, the <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> provides for the attenuation of a signal used during radiography interrogation thereby providing for detection of anomalies {{on the surface of}} the substrate...|$|R
30|$|It will {{be noticed}} that the <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> film of the coupon filmed with CIB has {{increased}} from 1.9 to 3.2  μm, while {{the thickness of the}} coupon filmed with CIA is not seen after the test. Clearly, for the given conditions where both coupons are filmed in neat <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (i.e. batch application), the water-based <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> CIB provided better protection than the oil-based <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> CIA. This is an interesting observation as before the test one would have thought that the coupon with the thicker <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> film would provide better protection.|$|R
25|$|Organic methanol, {{produced}} from wood or other organic materials (bioalcohol), {{has been suggested}} as a renewable alternative to petroleum-based hydrocarbons.

25|$|Traditionally, {{there were}} two major <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors</b> used in {{vehicles}}: silicates and phosphates. American made vehicles traditionally used both silicates and phosphates. European makes contain silicates and other inhibitors, but no phosphates. Japanese makes traditionally use phosphates and other inhibitors, but no silicates.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{mixtures}} {{are commonly}} used in HVAC and industrial heating or cooling systems as a high-capacity heat transfer medium.

40|$|Abstract. The various {{methods for}} {{improving}} chloride penetration {{resistance in the}} reinforced concrete have been developed. Among the related general ways, using of <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> became very common.

30|$|Methods {{have been}} {{developed}} to formulate organic molecules with large alkyl tails in water-based products (Yang and Jovancicevic 2009). We have found in several instances that new water-based <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> products provide longer treatment lives and better protection than similar inhibitors in oil-based formulations (Yang et al. 2007). A new water-dispersible, HT <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> was developed that had similar HT stability and <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> properties as a successful oil-soluble <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (Ramachandran et al. 2009).|$|R
25|$|Chlorine dioxide is {{superior}} to some other secondary water disinfection methods in that chlorine dioxide: 1) is an EPA registered biocide, 2) is not negatively impacted by pH, 3) does not lose efficacy over time (the bacteria will not grow resistant to it) and 4) is not negatively impacted by silica and phosphate, which are commonly used potable water <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{applications}} are being developed. For example, {{it was reported}} that coating of aluminium or various aluminium alloys produces very corrosion-resistance surface, which then resisted immersion into concentrated aqueous solution of NaCl for two months without sign of pitting. The coating is produced either by immersion into aqueous solution of NdCl3 for a week or by electrolytic deposition using the same solution. In comparison with traditional chromium based <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> NdCl3 and other rare-earth salts are environment friendly and much less toxic to humans and animals.|$|E
25|$|All {{automotive}} antifreeze formulations, {{including the}} newer organic acid (OAT antifreeze) formulations, are environmentally hazardous {{because of the}} blend of additives (around 5%), including lubricants, buffers and <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Because the additives in antifreeze are proprietary, the safety data sheets (SDS) provided by the manufacturer list only those compounds which {{are considered to be}} significant safety hazards when used in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Common additives include sodium silicate, disodium phosphate, sodium molybdate, sodium borate, denatonium benzoate and dextrin (hydroxyethyl starch). Disodium fluorescein dyes are added to antifreeze to help trace the source of leaks, and as an identifier since some different formulations are incompatible.|$|E
30|$|In {{previous}} work (Yang et al. 2007), {{it was found}} in field tests that a batch treatment of three gallons of water-dispersible <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> [CID (CRW 9196)] was as effective as five gallons of a similar oil-soluble <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> [CIC (CRO 193)]. This was a surprising result that was attributed {{to the fact that}} the oil-soluble <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> produced large spherical emulsion droplets of approximately 100  μm in diameter, while the water-dispersible <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> had much smaller droplets (1 – 2  μm). Due to the difference in size, the water-dispersible <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> can have 105 – 106 more droplets dispersed in the brine. This likely improves the batch treatment performance.|$|R
30|$|The {{resolution}} of the technique is in the micron range, so it does not cover the nanometer-thick monolayer or bi-layer <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> films that may exist. The results here show a thinner film with the water-based <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (CIB) than the oil-based <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (CIA) after filming in neat solution. After placing the filmed coupons in a WB, we see better protection with the water-based <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (CIB) than the oil-based <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> (CIA). The film thickness of the coupon filmed with CIB also grows thicker from 1.9 to 3.2  μm after being placed in the WB corrosion test. This may indicate that the film incorporates oil in the inhibitor film.|$|R
30|$|The results {{indicate}} a thicker film of 3.9  μm with the oil-soluble <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> CIA and 1.9  μm with the water-dispersible <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitor</b> CIB.|$|R
25|$|If the {{environment}} is controlled (especially in recirculating systems), <b>corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors</b> can often be added to it. These chemicals form an electrically insulating or chemically impermeable coating on exposed metal surfaces, to suppress electrochemical reactions. Such methods make the system less sensitive to scratches or defects in the coating, since extra inhibitors can be made available wherever metal becomes exposed. Chemicals that inhibit corrosion include some of the salts in hard water (Roman water systems are famous for their mineral deposits), chromates, phosphates, polyaniline, other conducting polymers and {{a wide range of}} specially-designed chemicals that resemble surfactants (i.e. long-chain organic molecules with ionic end groups).|$|E

2500|$|Heat is {{typically}} transferred through engineered heating or cooling systems {{by using a}} flowing gas or liquid.

2500|$|<b>Corrosion</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> such as calcium nitrite , {{can also}} {{be added to the}} water mix before pouring concrete. Generally, 1–2wt.% of [...] with respect to cement weight is needed to prevent {{corrosion}} of the rebars. The nitrite anion is a mild oxidizer that oxidizes the soluble and mobile ferrous ions (Fe2+) present at the surface of the corroding steel and causes them to precipitate as an insoluble ferric hydroxide (Fe(OH)3). This causes the passivation of steel at the anodic oxidation sites. Nitrite is a much more active corrosion inhibitor than nitrate, which is a less powerful oxidizer of the divalent iron.|$|E
