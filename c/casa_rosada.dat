5|$|His {{body was}} flown to the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> {{for a state}} funeral, and three {{national}} days of mourning were declared. Kirchner's funeral was attended by thousands, despite heavy rain. According to media reports, 1,000 people per hour entered the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> in groups of 100 to 150. Cristina Kirchner, dressed in mourning, {{stood next to the}} coffin. People brought candles, flags and flowers, some of which Cristina accepted personally.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner {{took office}} as {{president}} of Argentina on 25 May 2003. Contrary to tradition, the ceremony {{was held at the}} Palace of the Argentine National Congress rather than <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada.</b> He announced that he would spearhead change on many issues, from politics to culture. The ceremony was attended by the provincial governors, Supreme Court president Julio Nazareno, the heads of the armed forces, and Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Raúl Alfonsín was the only former president in attendance. Kirchner walked to the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> along Avenida de Mayo, breaking with protocol to get close to the people, and was accidentally hit {{in the head with a}} camera.|$|E
5|$|Parker's {{finished}} script included 146 {{changes to}} the concept album's music and lyrics. In May 1995, he and Rice visited Lloyd Webber {{at his home in}} France, where Parker tried to bring them to work on the film. Rice and Lloyd Webber had not worked together for many years, and the script for Evita required that they compose new music. In June 1995, with assistance from the United States Department of State and senator Chris Dodd, Parker arranged a private meeting with Menem in Argentina to discuss the film's production and request permission to film at the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada,</b> the executive mansion. Although he expressed his discontent with the production, Menem granted the filmmakers creative freedom to shoot in Argentina, but not in the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada.</b> He also advised Parker to be prepared to face protests against the film. Parker had the film's production designer Brian Morris take photographs of the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada,</b> so that the production could construct a replica at Shepperton Studios in England. The director visited seven other countries before deciding to film on location in Buenos Aires and Budapest.|$|E
5|$|Arts {{commentator}} Melvyn Bragg {{hosted a}} special edition of The South Bank Show about Paige's career in 1996, titled The Faces of Elaine Paige. The episode saw her visiting parts of the world where plays she had starred in had been set: the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> in Buenos Aires, Argentina where Eva Perón had given speeches; the Parisian haunts of Edith Piaf including a meeting with her collaborator Charles Aznavour; and Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|As {{president}} of the first government body created after the May Revolution, Saavedra is considered the first ruler of Argentina. However, as the Spanish juntas were not a presidential system, Saavedra {{was not the first}} President of Argentina; that office would be created a decade afterwards. The <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada,</b> official residence of the President of Argentina, holds a bust of Saavedra at the Hall of busts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days, Menem sported an image {{similar to the}} old caudillos, such as Facundo Quiroga and Chacho Peñaloza. He groomed his sideburns in a similar style. His presidential inauguration was {{attended}} by several gauchos. Contrary to Peronist tradition, Menem did not prepare huge rallies in the Plaza de Mayo to address {{the people from the}} balcony of the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada.</b> Instead, he took full advantage of mass media, such as television.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Alfonsín {{supported}} a {{faction of the}} UCR that favoured the idea of carrying an independent candidate for the 2007 presidential elections. The UCR, instead of fielding its own candidate, endorsed Roberto Lavagna, a center-left economist {{who presided over the}} dramatic recovery in the Argentine economy from 2002 until he parted ways with President Néstor Kirchner in December 2005. Unable to sway enough disaffected Kirchner supporters, Lavagna garnered third place. Alfonsín was honoured by President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner with a bust of his likeness at the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> on October 1, 2008. This was his last public appearance.|$|E
5|$|There was {{increased}} looting on December 20, both in Buenos Aires and the Conurbano. The cacerolazos continued; {{large groups of}} people started demonstrations calling for the government's resignation. The unions—first the CTA and then the CGT—began general strikes against the state of emergency. Most of the UCR withdrew their support to De la Rúa, so he asked the PJ to create a government coalition. The PJ refused, and De la Rúa resigned from government. His last administrative action was to lift the state of emergency. He gave his resignation to the Congress at 19:45 local time on December 20, 2001, and left the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> in a helicopter. He had ruled for two years, half of his term of office.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the first}} cabinet, {{organised}} in Chascomús, was composed of trusted colleagues of Alfonsín. Alfonsín appointed as minister of labour Antonio Mucci, who belonged to a faction of the UCR that sought to reduce the influence of Peronism among labour unions, and promptly sent a bill to Congress designed to promote independent unions. Facing an economic crisis, he appointed Bernardo Grinspun as minister of the economy. He appointed Aldo Neri minister of health, Dante Caputo minister of foreign relations, Antonio Tróccoli minister of interior affairs, Roque Carranza minister of public works, Carlos Alconada Aramburu minister of education, and Raúl Borrás minister of defense. Juan Carlos Pugliese led the chamber of deputies, and Edison Otero was the provisional president of the senate. Many presidential negotiations {{took place at the}} Quinta de Olivos, the official residence of the president, rather than at the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada.</b>|$|E
25|$|For {{more than}} 24 hours, {{hundreds}} of thousands of people filed past Kirchner’s body lying in state, in a state funeral at the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> attended by several Argentine personalities and eight South American leaders. Starting 29 October afternoon, a massive popular procession accompanied the remains of Néstor Kirchner from <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> to the metropolitan airport, and then from the airport of Río Gallegos to the cemetery.|$|E
25|$|The Argentine Meteors {{were first}} used in combat during the 16 June 1955 {{rebellion}} when, {{in an attempt}} to kill Juan Perón, rebel-flown aircraft bombed the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada.</b> A loyalist Meteor shot down a rebel AT-6, while another strafed rebel-held Ezeiza airport. The rebels seized Morón Airport and Air Base, base of the Meteors, and used several captured aircraft to perform multiple attacks against loyalist forces and the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> before the rebellion was defeated by day's end.|$|E
25|$|People {{waited in}} line {{to get into the}} <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada.</b> Starting on the {{afternoon}} of 29 October, a massive popular procession accompanied the remains of Néstor Kirchner from <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> to the metropolitan airport., and then from the airport of Río Gallegos to the cemetery. Kirchner was buried in a private ceremony, attended only by his wife, family, and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, who had remained with the President’s family throughout the mourning period in Argentina.|$|E
25|$|A Historical Museum {{was created}} in 1957 to display presidential memorabilia and {{selected}} belongings, such as sashes, batons, books, furniture, and three carriages. The remains of the former fort were partially excavated in 1991, and the uncovered structures were incorporated into the Museum of the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada.</b> Located behind the building, these works led to the rerouting of Paseo Colón Avenue, unifying the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> with Parque Colón (Columbus Park) behind it. Plans were announced in 2009 {{for the restoration of}} surviving portions of Taylor's Customs House, as well.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> {{itself is}} {{currently}} undergoing extensive renovation delayed by the 2001 economic crisis. The work {{is scheduled for}} completion on the 2010 bicentennial of the May Revolution that led to independence.|$|E
25|$|His private {{funeral was}} {{attended}} by his family and close friends. A state funeral was held on 28 October 2010, while a vigil was kept at the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> presidential palace in Buenos Aires, starting {{on the morning of}} 28 October, with the attendance of Latin American leaders.|$|E
25|$|On 16 December Macri {{met with}} members of the Qom {{community}} and 30 other groups of indigenous peoples. The meeting was held at the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> Bicentennial Museum, and the delegation was headed by Qom community leader Félix Díaz. Macri said that the recognition of indigenous communities and support for indigenous peoples are policies of his government.|$|E
25|$|Later {{she went}} to the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada,</b> where the {{received}} the presidential attributes in the White Hall {{at the hands of the}} Temporary President of the Senate, Federico Pinedo, President of the Chamber of Deputies Emilio Monzó and President of the Supreme Court Ricardo Lorenzetti. Minutes later she and the President went to the historic balcony where thousands of people waited in the Plaza de Mayo.|$|E
25|$|The eastern {{face of the}} obelisk was {{adorned with}} a golden sun, which now faces toward the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada.</b> The {{remaining}} three sides are decorated with crowns of laurels in alto-relievo. Pueyrredón also modified the original pedestal and capital, increasing their height and breadth. Each of the four sides of the base was adorned with the national arms. A new fence was constructed and a gaslight placed at each corner.|$|E
25|$|Lanata aired an {{interview}} with Miriam Quiroga, Néstor Kirchner's secretary, who described people moving full bags of money from the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> and the Quinta de Olivos to El Calafate (Kirchner's hometown) with the Tango 01 presidential aircraft. When later, in 2015, Quiroga was questioned by Judge Luis Rodríguez she confessed that these were false allegations intended to promote {{a book on the}} subject co-authored with her husband.|$|E
25|$|After World War II, Argentina {{became a}} haven for Nazi war criminals, with {{explicit}} protection from Perón. Author Uki Goñi alleges that Axis Power collaborators, including Pierre Daye, met with Perón at <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> (Pink House), the President's official residence. In this meeting, a network would have been created with support by the Argentine Immigration Service and the Foreign Office. The Swiss Chief of Police Heinrich Rothmund and the Croatian Roman Catholic priest Krunoslav Draganović also helped organize the ratline.|$|E
25|$|During {{most of the}} 19th century, the {{political}} status of the city remained a sensitive subject. It was already the capital of Buenos Aires Province, and between 1853 and 1860 it was {{the capital of the}} seceded State of Buenos Aires. The issue was fought out more than once on the battlefield, until the matter was finally settled in 1880 when the city was federalized and became the seat of government, with its mayor appointed by the president. The <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> became the seat of the president.|$|E
25|$|He {{was overthrown}} on March 29 by a {{decision}} of Army Chief of Staff General Raúl Poggi, and was surrounded {{in the presidential}} offices at the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada.</b> Frondizi was spirited to Martín García Island, a tiny exclave on the Río de la Plata, and subsequently to the Andes resort town of Bariloche, where he would spend the next year. His appointed successor, Senate President José María Guido, initially refused the dubious honor, citing loyalty to the president. He accepted, however, after Frondizi asked him to.|$|E
25|$|Its main {{building}} {{is located in}} Ave. 25 de Mayo 11 (with a backdoor access through Ave. Leandro N. Alem 10), {{at the heart of}} Downtown Buenos Aires, near to the Presidential Palace and Plaza de Mayo. Although the central base is the 25 de Mayo building and annexes, many buildings, known as bases or operation centers, are spread throughout the city of Buenos Aires. There are reports that the {{main building}} is also connected to the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada,</b> which is across the street, through an underground passage.|$|E
25|$|Another {{case with}} foreign origins {{is that of}} Guido Alejandro Antonini Wilson, a self-identified member of the entourage of Hugo Chávez, who arrived in Argentina in August 2007 on a private flight paid for by Argentine and Venezuelan state officials. Wilson was {{carrying}} US$790,550 in cash, {{which he did not}} declare and which the police seized on arrival. A few days later Wilson, a Venezuelan-American and a close friend of Chávez's, was a guest at a signing ceremony involving Kirchner and Chávez at the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada.</b> He was later arrested on money laundering and contraband charges, and it was established that the cash was to have been delivered to the Kirchners as a clandestine contribution to Fernández's campaign chest.|$|E
25|$|An {{investigation}} of 22,000 documents by the DAIA in 1997 {{discovered that the}} network was managed by Rodolfo Freude who had {{an office in the}} <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> and was close to Eva Perón's brother, Juan Duarte. According to Ronald Newton, Ludwig Freude, Rodolfo's father, was probably the local representative of the Office Three secret service headed by Joachim von Ribbentrop, with probably more influence than the German ambassador Edmund von Thermann. He had met Perón in the 1930s, and had contacts with Generals Juan Pistarini, Domingo Martínez, and José Molina. Ludwig Freude's house became the meetingplace for Nazis and Argentine military officers supporting the Axis. In 1943, he traveled with Perón to Europe to attempt an arms deal with Germany.|$|E
25|$|On April 5, 1811, {{with the}} {{approval}} of the Buenos Aires Cabildo, it was decided that the program of festivities commemorating {{the first anniversary of the}} Revolución de Mayo would include the construction of a pyramid. History does not record why a pyramidal form was chosen for the monument. Some speculate that it was an attempt to emulate the pyramids carved into the pillars of Paris' Porte Saint-Denis, to which the Pirámide de Mayo bears some resemblance. Since 1763 the Plaza de Mayo had been divided by the Vieja Recova (Old Arcade) into two smaller plazas: the one facing the eventual site of the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> was known as the Plazoleta del Fuerte, and the one facing the Cabildo was known as the Plaza de la Victoria. The pyramid was situated in the center of the latter.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} tourist sites {{are found in}} the {{historic}} core of the city, in the Montserrat and San Telmo neighborhoods. Buenos Aires was conceived around the Plaza de Mayo, the colony's administrative center. To the east of the square is the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada,</b> the official seat of the executive branch of the government of Argentina. To the north, the Catedral Metropolitana which has stood in the same location since colonial times, and the Banco de la Nación Argentina building, a parcel of land originally owned by Juan de Garay. Other important colonial institutions were Cabildo, to the west, which was renovated during the construction of Avenida de Mayo and Julio A. Roca. To the south is the Congreso de la Nación (National Congress), which currently houses the Academia Nacional de la Historia (National Academy of History). Lastly, to the northwest, is City Hall.|$|E
25|$|Macri {{announced}} his cabinet on 25 November 2015, {{about two weeks}} before he was due to take office. The presidential transition was difficult. Macri and Kirchner met briefly; she provided no help to the new administration, and spoke only about the inauguration ceremony. They disagreed about its location; Kirchner wanted it to {{take place at the}} Palace of the Argentine National Congress, and Macri favoured the White Hall of the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada.</b> Plans for violence against Macri supporters near the Plaza during the inauguration were rumoured, and it was unclear who would control the police during the ceremony. Judge Maria Servini de Cubría ruled that Kirchner's term of office ended at midnight on 10 December, and provisional Senate president Federico Pinedo {{was in charge of the}} executive branch for the 12 hours between the end of Kirchner's term and Macri's swearing-in. Kirchner left Buenos Aires to attend the inauguration of sister-in-law Alicia Kirchner as governor of Santa Cruz Province that day.|$|E
25|$|General Juan Lavalle was {{initially}} neither federalist nor unitarian, but {{after his return}} he began {{to be influenced by}} the unitarians, who tried to gain him for their side. The bulk of the army arrived to Buenos Aires on November 26, being in a bad shape: they lacked clothing and food, they had unpaid wages since months ago, and resented the peace treaty. There were rumors in the city that the army would revolt against the governor Dorrego, but he dismissed those rumors. The leaders of the revolution met on December 1 to organize the coup, and Dorrego began to reconsider it. But according to the memoirs of Tomás de Iriarte, the minister Tomás Guido prevented the government from organizing a proper resistance. Lavalle’s forces gathered in La Recoleta, and began to march at 3:30 in the morning, once he got the horses for the cavalry. The admiral William Brown supported the operation and prepared a naval siege of the Fort (modern <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada),</b> but it was not needed. Lacking any means of defense, Dorrego escaped to the countryside. A group of soldiers occupied the Buenos Aires Cabildo and another secured the police. It was unclear if the Fort would begin a resistance, but once the departure of Dorrego was known, the revolutionaries claimed victory and played a military march.|$|E
500|$|Six days later, between 250,000 and 350,000 people {{gathered}} {{in front of}} the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada,</b> Argentina's government house, to demand Juan Perón's release, and their wish was granted. At 11 pm, Juan Perón stepped onto the balcony of the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> and addressed the crowd. Biographer Robert D. Crassweller claims that this moment was very powerful because it was very dramatic and recalled many important aspects of Argentine history. Crassweller writes that Juan Perón enacted the role of a caudillo addressing his people in the tradition of Argentine leaders Rosas and Yrigoyen. Crassweller also claims that the evening contained [...] "mystic overtones" [...] of a [...] "quasi-religious" [...] nature.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} Buenos Aires with scenes {{depicting}} Eva's childhood in 1936. Locations included Los Toldos, {{the town of}} Junín, where Eva was raised, and Chivilcoy, where her father's funeral was held. On February 23, 1996, Menem arranged a meeting with Parker, Madonna, Pryce and Banderas, and granted the crew permission to film in the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> shortly before they were scheduled to leave Buenos Aires. On March 9, the production filmed the musical number [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" [...] there, utilizing 4,000 extras for two days. Filming in Buenos Aires concluded after five weeks.|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by Julie Covington for the 1976 concept album, Evita, and was later included in the 1978 musical of the same name. The song was written and composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice while they were researching the life of Argentinian leader Eva Perón. It appeared at the opening and {{near the end of}} the show, initially as the spirit of the dead Eva exhorting the people of Argentina not to mourn her, and finally during Eva's speech from the balcony of <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada.</b> Covington was signed by the songwriters for the track, based on her previous work in musicals.|$|E
500|$|Currently, the Polvorín Workshop – {{originally}} inaugurated {{along with}} Line A – is being {{transformed into a}} museum to display artefacts and the former rolling stock of the Underground. The workshop also serves as the headquarters for the Association of Friends of the Tramway {{and many of the}} Underground's historical artefacts are stored there, such as the wooden UEC Preston [...] "palace cars", which also make appearances on Line A during special occasions such as anniversaries and even the inauguration of president Raúl Alfonsín in 1983, where he and other officials were transported from the National Congress to the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> using these cars.|$|E
500|$|On 22 August 1951, {{the unions}} held a mass rally of {{two million people}} called [...] "Cabildo Abierto." [...] (The name [...] "Cabildo Abierto" [...] was a {{reference}} and tribute to the first local Argentine government of the May Revolution, in 1810.) The Peróns addressed the crowd from the balcony of a huge scaffolding {{set up on the}} Avenida 9 de Julio, several blocks away from the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada,</b> the official government house of Argentina. Overhead were two large portraits of Eva and Juan Perón. It has been claimed that [...] "Cabildo Abierto" [...] was the largest public display of support in history for a female political figure.|$|E
500|$|Eva is hospitalized and {{learns that}} she has cancer. She declines the {{position}} of Vice President due to her failing health, and makes one final broadcast {{to the people of}} Argentina. She understands that her life was short because she shone like the [...] "brightest fire", and helps Perón prepare to go on without her. A large crowd surrounds the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> in a candlelight vigil praying for her recovery when the light of her room goes out, signifying her death. At Eva's funeral, Ché is seen at her coffin, marveling at the influence of her brief life. He walks up to her glass coffin, kisses it, and joins the crowd of passing mourners.|$|E
500|$|In this context, {{the first}} {{proposals}} {{for the building}} of an underground system were made, along with requests for government grants: first, in 1886, and several more in 1889. However, the Ministry of Interior (Ministerio del Interior, in Spanish) denied the city administration the power to license building in the city's subsoil and for this reason, subsequent drafts were submitted directly to this ministry. In 1894, when {{it was decided to}} construct the Congress building in its present location, the underground idea was revived, since it would shorten the travel time between the <b>Casa</b> <b>Rosada</b> and the Congress. In 1896 Miguel Cané, former Mayor of Buenos Aires (1892–1893), expressed the need to build an underground railway similar to the one in London ...|$|E
