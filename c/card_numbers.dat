5|$|Digital: A Love Story is {{a visual}} novel, or {{interactive}} fiction game, where the game's {{story is told}} primarily through text. The game is presented {{as if on a}} computer from the late 1980s running the Amie operating system (the name and visual appearance a reference to 1.x versions of AmigaOS). The player logs into bulletin board systems, or BBSs, where they read and reply to messages from other people. Messages received from other characters in the game are displayed through a different program on the computer screen. Accessing a BBS requires the knowledge of the telephone number for that board, which the player must type in manually. Boards that require a long-distance telephone number to reach require the player to use illegally obtained long-distance calling <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> found online. Accessing boards also requires the player to either set up a user account for that board or to know the password necessary to enter the system.|$|E
25|$|The {{company had}} a data breach in September 2014. One {{major reason for}} the data breach was the {{practice}} of entering credit <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> directly into computers at the service-desk and pro-desk, and in specialty departments including flooring, kitchen cabinets, appliances, and millwork, rather than using POS credit card terminals directly. The practice was stopped, and Home Depot offered a year of free credit monitoring through AllClearID for any customers who requested it. There were also reports of credit <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> being stolen when used to make purchases on Homedepot.com.|$|E
25|$|As {{worldwide}} {{sales of}} smartphones began exceeding those of feature phones, the NSA {{decided to take}} advantage of the smartphone boom. This is particularly advantageous because the smartphone combines a myriad of data that would interest an intelligence agency, such as social contacts, user behavior, interests, location, photos and credit <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> and passwords.|$|E
5000|$|A {{controlled}} payment {{number is}} an alias for a credit <b>card</b> <b>number,</b> {{with a limited}} number of transactions, and an expiration date between two and twelve months from the issue date. This [...] "alias" [...] number is indistinguishable from an ordinary credit <b>card</b> <b>number,</b> and the user's actual credit <b>card</b> <b>number</b> is never revealed to the merchant.|$|R
50|$|The {{remainder}} {{of the division of}} 113 by 10 equals 3 (113 mod 10 = 3), and is also equal to the first digit of the ID <b>card</b> <b>number,</b> so this ID <b>card</b> <b>number</b> is correct.|$|R
25|$|Credit cards have {{a printed}} or {{embossed}} bank <b>card</b> <b>number</b> {{complying with the}} ISO/IEC 7812 <b>numbering</b> standard. The <b>card</b> <b>number's</b> prefix, called the Bank Identification Number, is the sequence of digits {{at the beginning of}} the number that determine the bank to which a credit <b>card</b> <b>number</b> belongs. This is the first six digits for MasterCard and Visa cards. The next nine digits are the individual account number, and the final digit is a validity check code.|$|R
25|$|In fact, many sellers {{could not}} qualify for a credit card Merchant account because they lacked a {{commercial}} credit history. The service also appealed to auction buyers because they could fund PayPal accounts using credit cards or bank account balances, without divulging credit <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> to unknown sellers. PayPal employed an aggressive marketing campaign to accelerate its growth, depositing $10 in new users' PayPal accounts.|$|E
25|$|WikiLeaks {{has drawn}} {{criticism}} for its absence of whistleblowing on or criticism of Russia, and for criticising the Panama Papers' exposé of businesses and individuals with offshore bank accounts. WikiLeaks {{has also been}} criticised for inadequately curating its content and violating the personal privacy of individuals. WikiLeaks has, for instance, revealed Social Security numbers, medical information, credit <b>card</b> <b>numbers,</b> details of suicide attempts, and other sensitive personal information.|$|E
25|$|On June 3, 2008, President George W. Bush {{signed the}} Credit and Debit Card Receipt Clarification Act (H.R. 4008) into law. The {{bipartisan}} bill, which Bachmann cosponsored with Congressman Tim Mahoney (D-Fla.), removes statutory damages {{for violations of}} a 2003 federal law prohibiting merchants from printing consumers' credit <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> and expiration dates on sales receipts, in order to end class-action lawsuits aimed at businesses that violated the law.|$|E

25|$|Arrest and {{indictment}} of Max Ray Butler, {{co-founder of the}} Carders Market carding website. Butler was indicted by {{a federal grand jury}} in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after his September 5, 2007 arrest, on wire fraud and identity theft charges. According to the indictment, Butler hacked over the Internet into computers at financial institutions and credit card processing centers and sold {{the tens of thousands of}} credit <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> that he acquired in the process.|$|E
25|$|LTTE {{was also}} {{involved}} in credit card fraud, in the United Kingdom. In 2010, STF arrested the mastermind behind this fraud, Neshanadan Muruganandan alias Anandan. LTTE had cloned credit cards using PIN and <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> obtained from unsuspecting card holders in the United Kingdom, and funds were later transferred out of their accounts. In 2007, Norwegian authorities sentenced six LTTE members for skimming more than 5.3 million Norwegian kroner in a similar credit card scam.|$|E
25|$|E-waste {{presents}} a potential security threat {{to individuals and}} exporting countries. Hard drives that are not properly erased before the computer is disposed of can be reopened, exposing sensitive information. Credit <b>card</b> <b>numbers,</b> private financial data, account information, and records of online transactions can be accessed by most willing individuals. Organized criminals in Ghana commonly search the drives for information to use in local scams. Electronic files about government contracts have been discovered on hard drives found in Agbogbloshie. Multimillion-dollar agreements from United States security {{institutions such as the}} Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Transportation Security Administration, and Homeland Security have all resurfaced in Agbogbloshie.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} {{numbers on the}} photo card, that could cause confusion: First the photo <b>card</b> <b>number</b> (PC Number) on the front centre-left. This number does not change even after re-issue. Second there is a <b>card</b> <b>number</b> on the front top, and finally a number on the rear, top left.|$|R
50|$|In the 26 bit Wiegand format bit 1 is an {{even parity}} bit. Bits 2-9 are a {{facility}} code. Bits 10-25 are the <b>card</b> <b>number.</b> Bit 26 is an odd parity bit. Other formats have a similar structure of leading facility code followed by <b>card</b> <b>number</b> and including parity bits for error checking.|$|R
5000|$|For example, when {{testing a}} program that takes a user's {{personal}} details and verifies their credit <b>card</b> <b>number,</b> a developer may decide to add a magic string shortcut whereby entering the unlikely input of [...] "***" [...] as a credit <b>card</b> <b>number</b> would cause the program to automatically proceed as if the card was valid, without spending time verifying it. If the developer forgets to remove the magic string, and a user of the final program happens to enter [...] "***" [...] as a placeholder credit <b>card</b> <b>number</b> while filling in the form, the user would inadvertently trigger the hidden functionality.|$|R
25|$|The {{recycling}} of old computers raises an important privacy issue. The old storage devices still hold private information, such as emails, passwords, and credit <b>card</b> <b>numbers,</b> {{which can be}} recovered simply by someone's using software available freely on the Internet. Deletion of a file does not actually remove the file from the hard drive. Before recycling a computer, users should remove the hard drive, or hard drives if {{there is more than}} one, and physically destroy it or store it somewhere safe. There are some authorized hardware recycling companies to whom the computer may be given for recycling, and they typically sign a non-disclosure agreement.|$|E
25|$|While American {{citizens}} were generally assured {{of a simple}} way to leave the country just by showing up to an evacuation point, South Vietnamese who wanted to leave Saigon before it fell often resorted to independent arrangements. The under-the-table payments required to gain a passport and exit visa jumped sixfold, and the price of seagoing vessels tripled. Those who owned property in the city were often forced to sell it at a substantial loss or abandon it altogether; the asking price of one particularly impressive house was cut 75 percent within a two-week period. American visas were of enormous value, and Vietnamese seeking American sponsors posted advertisements in newspapers. One such ad read: “Seeking adoptive parents. Poor diligent students” followed by names, birthdates, and identity <b>card</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Operation Firewall: In October 2004, 28 suspects—located across eight U.S. {{states and}} six countries—were arrested {{on charges of}} {{identity}} theft, computer fraud, credit-card fraud, and conspiracy. Nearly 30 national and foreign field offices of the U.S. Secret Service, including the newly established national ECTFs, and countless local enforcement agencies from around the globe, were involved in this operation. Collectively, the arrested suspects trafficked in at least 1.7 million stolen credit <b>card</b> <b>numbers,</b> which amounted to $4.3 million of losses to financial institutions. However, authorities estimated that prevented loss to the industry was {{in the hundreds of}} millions of dollars. The operation, which started in July 2003 and lasted for more than a year, led investigators to identify three cyber-criminal groups: Shadowcrew, Carderplanet, and Darkprofits.|$|E

25|$|In July 2009, a {{confidential}} cable originating from the United States Department of State, and under United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's name, ordered US diplomats {{to spy on}} Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, and other top UN officials. The intelligence information the diplomats were ordered to gather included biometric information (which apparently included DNA, fingerprints, and iris scans), passwords, and personal encryption keys used in private and commercial networks for official communications. It also included Internet and intranet usernames, e-mail addresses, web site URLs useful for identification, credit <b>card</b> <b>numbers,</b> frequent flyer account numbers, and work schedules. The targeted human intelligence was requested in {{a process known as}} the National Humint Collection Directive, and was aimed at foreign diplomats of US allies as well.|$|E
25|$|Credit card {{security}} {{relies on}} the physical security of the plastic card {{as well as the}} privacy of the credit card number. Therefore, whenever a person other than the card owner has access to the card or its number, security is potentially compromised. Once, merchants would often accept credit <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> without additional verification for mail order purchases. It's now common practice to only ship to confirmed addresses as a security measure to minimise fraudulent purchases. Some merchants will accept a credit card number for in-store purchases, whereupon access to the number allows easy fraud, but many require the card itself to be present, and require a signature. A lost or stolen card can be cancelled, and if this is done quickly, will greatly limit the fraud that can take place in this way. European banks can require a cardholder's security PIN be entered for in-person purchases with the card.|$|E
500|$|In December 2011, AntiSec member [...] "sup_g" [...] (alleged by the U.S. {{government}} to be Jeremy Hammond) and others hacked Stratfor, a U.S.-based intelligence company, vandalizing its web page and publishing 30,000 credit <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> from its databases. AntiSec later released millions of the group's e-mails to Wikileaks.|$|E

2500|$|Arrest and {{indictment}} of Albert [...] "Segvec" [...] Gonzalez and 11 individuals; three U.S. citizens, one from Estonia, three from Ukraine, {{two from the}} People's Republic of China, one from Belarus, and one known only by an online alias. They were arrested on August 5, 2008, for the theft and sale of more than 40 million credit and debit <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> from major U.S. retailers, including TJX Companies, BJ's Wholesale Club, OfficeMax, Boston Market, Barnes & Noble, Sports Authority, Forever 21, and DSW. Gonzalez, the main organizer of the scheme, was charged with computer fraud, wire fraud, access device fraud, aggravated identity theft, and conspiracy for his {{leading role in the}} crime.|$|E
2500|$|Agent-assisted {{automation}} {{refers to}} automation used by call center agents to handle customer inquiries. There {{are two basic}} types: desktop automation and automated voice solutions. Desktop automation refers to software programming {{that makes it easier}} for the call center agent to work across multiple desktop tools. The automation would take the information entered into one tool and populate it across the others so it {{did not have to be}} entered more than once, for example. Automated voice solutions allow the agents to remain on the line while disclosures and other important information is provided to customers in the form of pre-recorded audio files. Specialized applications of these automated voice solutions enable the agents to process credit cards without ever seeing or hearing the credit <b>card</b> <b>numbers</b> or CVV codes ...|$|E
