40|$|The {{interface}} between a superconductor and a topological insulator {{has been proposed}} to harbor novel quasiparticles that realize physical schemes for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here, we present high resolution angle-resolved photoemission experimental results, which along with first principles calculations, suggest that the surface-edge states of Bi 2 Se 3 form a topological 2 D metal. When magnetic atoms are deposited, the surface tends to lose Kramers' degeneracy and a k-space <b>connection</b> <b>thread</b> between the bulk valence and conduction bands is lost. Our observed states carry a π Berry's phase suggesting that although the real materials are often electron doped fully undoped Bi 2 Se 3 would be a Z 2 topological insulator at room temperature.

30|$|The QEMU {{interface}} {{has three}} threads that {{allow it to}} handle different tasks. The QEMU R/W thread is a main thread provided by the QEMU in charge of processing the master read/write requests issued from the device driver. This thread will issue mReadRequest and mWriteRequest requests through an outgoing socket, and receives mReadAck acknowledgment through an incoming socket. The QEMU receiver thread receives any incoming network packages consisting of IRQRequest, sReadRequest, sWriteRequest, and mReadAck from the SystemC module shown {{on the right-hand side}} of Figure 7. The QEMU receiver acts as a slave interface and an interrupt controller. Depending on the content of the messages, it will read or write data from or to the QEMU, raise or pull down an interrupt signal, or pass mReadAck data to the QEMU R/W thread. The <b>connection</b> <b>thread</b> is responsible for maintaining the connection between the QEMU and the SystemC module.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the stress pattern generated through various thread design in experimental simulation models, when loaded immediately after placement and after osseointegration. METHODS: Three-dimensional (3 D) models were designed using CATIA, computer-aided design modeling software. The study was planned in 2 stages. Eight 2 D models were constructed of different thread forms, one set with frictionless and other with bonded for bone to implant interface and loaded vertically with 100 N. In Stage II, 6 3 D {{models of the}} different threads embedded in the cortical bone were constructed and loaded vertically and obliquely. RESULTS: In 2 D models, the von Mises stress concentrated at the crest in the bonded <b>connection</b> <b>thread</b> designs. The stress levels were {{in the range of}} 7 to 13 MPa. In the frictional implant bone interface, the thread designs had a clear effect on the stress levels in the bone. In the 3 D analysis, the complete implant design affected the stress levels. CONCLUSIONS: The thread design affects the magnitude of the stress peak in the bone more effectively in immediately loaded (frictionless) implants than the osseointegrated (bonded) implants. Maximum stress was observed at the first thread in most of the osseointegrated implants...|$|E

50|$|The pooling of {{resources}} {{can offer a}} significant performance boost in situations that have high cost associated with resource acquiring, high rate of the requests for resources, and a low overall count of simultaneously used resources.

40|$|Abstract. Screw <b>thread</b> <b>connection</b> is {{a common}} way of {{detachable}} connection. The invalidation of screw <b>thread</b> <b>connection</b> will lead to mechanical failure or even retirement. Vibration tapping is essentially a kind of high-energy impact cutting which increases the rigidity of the tool. Composite vibration tapping simultaneously with repeated cutting action reduces the surface recovery of plastic materials and enhances metal cutting rate. Theoretical study and experimental results show that vibration tapping improves the metal cutting rates, enhances the machining accuracy and makes screw <b>thread</b> <b>connection</b> assembly easier. At the same time, vibration tapping process does not reduce the strength of screw thread. As the screw thread can be more uniformed cut at different depths, vibration tapping enhances the strength of screw thread slightly...|$|R

40|$|The modern {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} of America has seen most of the high quality, easily obtainable resources, already produced, thus causing wells to be drilled deeper in search for unconventional resources. This means Oil Country Tubular Goods (OCTG) must improve in order to withstand harsher conditions; especially the ability of connections to effectively create leak tight seals. This study investigates the use of <b>thread</b> <b>connections</b> in tight gas fields; therefore, an insight into their potential to contribute to fulfilling the energy demands is necessary. Also, a survey of completed projects done in tight gas fields can provide vital information that will establish the minimum requirements <b>thread</b> <b>connection</b> must meet to perform its functions. To make suitable adjustments to ensure safe and efficient operations we must thoroughly understand the many aspects of <b>thread</b> <b>connections.</b> To have this understanding, a review of previous works was carried out that highlights the capabilities and imitations of <b>thread</b> <b>connections.</b> In addition to reviewing previous work done on thread connections; this study measured the viscosity of thread compounds under variable conditions.

40|$|<b>Threaded</b> <b>connections</b> are {{responsible}} assemblies, defining sucker rod string reliability. Despite {{the variety of}} their design, industrial materials analysis shows that breakages occur in rod body and <b>threaded</b> <b>connections.</b> In the process of lowering and lifting operations, aimed at well pump replacement, screwing and unscrewing of sucker rods threaded joints is repeated, so pin threads and couplings are worn. After analyzing the method of pin threads wear determining while screwing, unscrewing, connection and breakout sucker rods tightening, proposed by S. A. Babayan, {{it has been found}} out that the amount of thread wear during the makeup is 20 30 times greater than thread wear while fastening. According to this method the last three threads are practically unworn and deterioration of the first coil is 10 - 12 times greater than the wear of the last turns. The results of calculation correspond with the wear data in the course of sucker rods operation in an industrial environment. To identify and compare the distribution of stresses in the sucker rods <b>threaded</b> <b>connections</b> using the developed computer ANSYS, finite element axisymmetric models of new and worn standard <b>threaded</b> <b>connections</b> with a diameter of 19 mm have been created.

Having analyzed the simulation results we have made a conclusion that with the increase of sucker rod wear, stress distribution in pin thread becomes uniform, respectively, it has positive effect on the <b>threaded</b> <b>connection</b> durability under cyclic dynamic loads. With further deterioration, thread tensions are rising in the middle turns, and in extreme turns - are reduced, so the impact of further deterioration on the connection durability is negative. Also it have been found that at the limit thread wear maximum stresses are concentrated in the thread coupling, resulting in the fracture of its body...|$|R
