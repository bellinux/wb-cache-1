5000|$|The most {{important}} {{difference between the}} p-n diode and the Schottky diode is the reverse recovery time (trr), when the diode switches from the conducting to the non-conducting state. In a p-n diode, the reverse recovery time {{can be in the}} order of several microseconds to less than 100 ns for fast diodes. Schottky diodes do not have a recovery time, as there is nothing to recover from (i.e., there is no charge carrier depletion region at the junction). The switching time is ~100 ps for the small-signal diodes, and up to tens of nanoseconds for special high-capacity power diodes. With p-n-junction switching, there is also a reverse recovery current, which in high-power semiconductors brings increased EMI noise.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a loading {{technique}} for improving pulse radiation from bow-tie antennas is introduced. This technique al-lows transmission of short transient pulses with very small late-time ringing and relatively high radiation efficiency. It {{makes use of}} a combination of a constant resistive loading along the antenna and a <b>capacitive</b> <b>loading</b> with linearly increasing reactance toward the antenna ends. The constant resistive loading is applied using volumetric microwave absorbers to cover one side of the antenna and the linear <b>capacitive</b> <b>loading</b> is realized by constructing narrow slots on the antenna surface. Relatively high radiation efficiency is achieved by choosing the location of the slot nearest to the feed point {{in such a way that}} radiation from it combines constructively with radiation from the feed point. Using a 0. 8 -ns monocycle for ex-citation, the technique results in a level of late-time ringing of lower than 40 dB and at the same time the peak value of the transmitted pulse is 54 % higher than that of the same antenna without loading.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general model and its experimental validation for electrically tunable electromagnetic energy harvesters. Electrical tuning {{relies on the}} adjustment of the electrical load so that the {{maximum output power of}} the energy harvester occurs at a frequency which is different from the mechanical resonant frequency of the energy harvester. Theoretical analysis shows that for this approach to be feasible the electromagnetic vibration energy harvester’s coupling factor must be maximized so that its resonant frequency can be tuned with the minimum decrease of output power. Two different-sized electromagnetic energy harvesters were built and tested to validate the model. Experimentally, the micro-scale energy harvester has a coupling factor of 0. 0035 and an untuned resonant frequency of 70. 05 Hz. When excited at 30 mg, it was tuned by 0. 23 Hz by changing its <b>capacitive</b> <b>load</b> from 0 to 4000 nF; its effective tuning range is 0. 15 Hz for a <b>capacitive</b> <b>load</b> variation from 0 to 1500 nF.
