25|$|Quasi-experimental design refers {{especially}} to situations precluding random assignment to different conditions. Researchers can use <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> consider {{how much the}} nonrandom assignment threatens the study's validity. For example, in research on {{the best way to}} affect reading achievement in the first three grades of school, school administrators may not permit educational psychologists to randomly assign children to phonics and whole language classrooms, in which case the psychologists must work with preexisting classroom assignments. Psychologists will compare the achievement of children attending phonics and whole language classes.|$|E
25|$|Both English law, which applies in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland law {{are based}} on common-law principles. The essence of common law is that, subject to statute, the law is {{developed}} by judges in courts, applying statute, precedent and <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> the facts before them to give explanatory judgements of the relevant legal principles, which are reported and binding in future similar cases (stare decisis). The courts of England and Wales are headed by the Senior Courts of England and Wales, consisting of the Court of Appeal, the High Court of Justice (for civil cases) and the Crown Court (for criminal cases). The Supreme Court is the highest court in the land for both criminal and civil appeal cases in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and any decision it makes is binding on every other court in the same jurisdiction, often having a persuasive effect in other jurisdictions.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} television critics.

[...] Juliette Harrisson of Den of Geek named [...] "Kaddish" [...] the best stand-alone episode of season four and called its conceit [...] "absolutely real and utterly tragic" [...] despite being [...] "highly fantastical". Zack Handlen of The A.V.

500|$|In autumn 1887, a theatre manager named Korsh {{commissioned}} Chekhov {{to write}} a play, the result being Ivanov, written in a fortnight and produced that November. Though Chekhov found the experience [...] "sickening" [...] and painted a comic portrait of the chaotic production {{in a letter to}} his brother Alexander, the play was a hit and was praised, to Chekhov's bemusement, as a work of originality. Although Chekhov did not fully realise it at the time, Chekhov's plays, such as The Seagull (written in 1895), Uncle Vanya (written in 1897), The Three Sisters (written in 1900), and The Cherry Orchard (written in 1903) served as a revolutionary backbone to what is <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> the medium of acting to this day: an effort to recreate and express the [...] "realism" [...] of how people truly act and speak with each other and translating it to the stage to manifest the human condition as accurately as possible in hopes to make the audience reflect upon their own definition of what it means to be human, warts and all.|$|E

2500|$|The Aggadah {{is part of}} Judaism's Oral law (...) —the traditions {{providing}} the authoritative interpretation of the Written Law. In this context, the widely held view in rabbinic literature is that the aggadah {{is in fact a}} medium for the transmission of fundamental teachings (Homiletic Sayings—) or for explanations of verses in the Tanakh (Exegetic Sayings—). In Rabbinic thought, therefore, much of the Aggadah is understood as containing a hidden, allegorical dimension, in addition to its overt, literal sense. In general, where a literal interpretation contradicts rationality, the Rabbis seek an allegorical explanation: [...] "We are told to use our <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> decide whether an aggada is to be taken literally or not" [...] (Carmell, 2005).|$|E

2500|$|In 1995 and 1999, the Progressive Conservatives ran highly focused, disciplined campaigns {{based on}} lessons learned principally in US {{states by the}} Republican Party.

2500|$|Reason and Emotion (Walt Disney Academy Awards) {{is another}} film that {{attempts}} to help Americans at home understand how Germany became entranced {{under the influence of}} Hitler and Goebels and how they themselves can resist such propaganda.

[...] The narrator explains how Adolf Hitler preys upon those who let fear and emotion rule them. [...] The cartoon cuts to an animated Hitler controlling Germans through fear, hate, sympathy, and pride. [...] The film ends with reason and emotion being told that they must work together with reason ruling over one's actions while emotions are to be focused on staying positive in the fight ahead.|$|E
2500|$|After the 1955 general election, Attlee {{retired as}} leader. Bevan contested the {{leadership}} against both Morrison and Labour right-winger Hugh Gaitskell, {{but it was}} Gaitskell who emerged victorious. Bevan's remark that [...] "I know {{the right kind of}} political Leader for the Labour Party is a kind of desiccated calculating machine" [...] was assumed to refer to Gaitskell, although Bevan denied it (commenting upon Gaitskell's record as Chancellor of the Exchequer as having [...] "proved" [...] this). However, Gaitskell was prepared to make Bevan Shadow Colonial Secretary, and then Shadow Foreign Secretary in 1956. Bevan was as critical of the Egyptian dictator Colonel Nasser's seizure of the Suez Canal on 26 July 1956 as he was of the subsequent Anglo-French military response. He compared Nasser with Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. He was a vocal critic of the Conservative government's actions in the Suez Crisis, noticeably delivering high-profile speeches in Trafalgar Square on 4 November 1956 at a protest rally, and criticising the government's actions and arguments in Commons on 5 December 1956. At the Trafalgar rally, Bevan accused the government of a [...] "policy of bankruptcy and despair". Bevan stated at the Trafalgar rally: We are stronger than Egypt but there are other countries stronger than us. Are we prepared to accept for ourselves the logic we are applying to Egypt? If nations more powerful than ourselves accept the absence of principle, the anarchistic attitude of Eden and launch bombs on London, what answer have we got, what complaint have we got? If we are going to appeal to force, if force is to be the arbiter to which we appeal, it would at least make <b>common</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> try to make sure beforehand that we have got it, even if you accept that abysmal logic, that decadent point of view.We are in fact in the position today of having appealed to force {{in the case of a}} small nation, where if it is appealed to against us it will result in the destruction of Great Britain, not only as a nation, but as an island containing living men and women. Therefore I say to Anthony, I say to the British government, there is no count at all upon which they can be defended.They have besmirched the name of Britain. They have made us ashamed of the things of which formerly we were proud. They have offended against every principle of decency and there is only one way in which they can even begin to restore their tarnished reputation and that is to get out! Get out! Get out!
