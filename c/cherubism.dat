6000|$|All {{of which}} {{foregoing}} makes, I grant, a long parenthesis in my {{recovery of the}} more immediate Cambridge impressions. I have left them awaiting me, yet I am happy to say not sensibly the worse for it, in their cluster roundabout Miss Upham and her board of beneficiary images; which latter start up afresh and with the softest submission to any convenient neglect--that ineffably touching and confessed dependence of such apparitions on one's [...] "pleasure," [...] save the mark! for the flicker of restorative light. The image most vividly restored is doubtless that of Professor F. J. Child, head of the [...] "English Department" [...] at Harvard and master of that great modern science of folk-lore to his accomplishment in which his vast and slowly-published collection of the Ballad literature of our language is a recognised monument; delightful man, rounded character, passionate patriot, admirable talker, above all thorough humanist and humorist. He was the genial autocrat of that breakfast-table not only, but of our symposia otherwise timed, and as he comes back to me with the fresh and quite circular countenance of the time before the personal cares and complications of life had gravely thickened for him, his aspect all finely circular, with its close rings of the fairest hair, its golden rims of the largest glasses, its finished rotundity of figure and attitude, I see that there was the American spirit--since I was [...] "after" [...] it--of a quality deeply inbred, beautifully adjusted to all extensions of knowledge and taste and, as seemed to me, quite sublimely quickened by everything {{that was at the}} time so tremendously in question. That vision of him was never afterwards to yield to other lights--though these, even had occasion for them been more frequent with me, couldn't much have interfered with it; so that what I still most retain of him is the very flush and mobility, the living expansion and contraction, the bright comedy and almost lunar eclipse, of his cherubic face according as things appeared to be going for the country. I was always just across from him, as my brother, beside whom I took my place, had been, and I remember well how vivid a clock-face it became to me; I found still, as in my younger time, matter enough everywhere for gaping, but greatest of all, I think, while that tense season lasted, was my wonder for the signs and portents, the quips and cranks, the wreath√®d smiles, or otherwise the candid obscurations, of our prime talker's presented visage. I set, as it were, the small tick of my own poor watch by it--which private register would thump or intermit in agreement with these indications. I recover it that, thanks to the perpetual play of his sympathy and irony, confidence and scorn, as well as to that of my own less certainly directed sensibility, he struck me on the bad days, which were then so many, as fairly august, <b>cherubism</b> and all, for sincerity of association with every light and shade, every ebb and flow, of our Cause. Where he most shone out, indeed, so that depression then wasn't a gloom in him but a darting flame, was in the icy air of the attitude of the nations to us, that of the couple, the most potent, across the sea, with which we were especially concerned and which, as during the whole earlier half of the War and still longer it more and more defined itself, drew from him at once all the drolleries and all the asperities of his sarcasm. Nothing more particularly touched me in him, I make out--for it lingers in a light of its own--than the fashion after which he struck me as a fond grave guardian, not so much of the memory and the ashes yet awhile, as of the promise, in all its flower, of the sacrificial young men whom the University connection had passed through his hands and whom he looked out for with a tenderness of interest, a nursing pride, that was as contagious as I could possibly have wished it. I didn't myself know the young men, save three or four, and could only, at our distance, hold my tongue and do them homage; never afterwards (as I even then foreknew would be the case) missing, when I could help it, or failing to pick up, a single brush, a scattered leaf, of their growing or their riper legend. Certain of them whom I had neither seen nor, as they fell in battle, was destined ever to see, have lived for me since just as communicated images, figures created by his tone about them--which, I admit, mightn't or needn't have mattered to me for all the years, yet which couldn't help so doing from the moment the right touch had handed them over to my restless claim.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Cherubism</b> is {{autosomal}} dominantly linked, {{meaning the}} displayed phenotype {{is determined by}} the dominant allele while the normal allele is recessive. One copy of the dominant allele is enough to cause the disorder. Because the disease was found to be dominant the diseased phenotype tends to be seen in every generation at some level of severity. Therefore, afflicted fathers or mothers of children with <b>Cherubism</b> pass the phenotype to both daughters and sons. [...] <b>Cherubism</b> has also been found from the random mutation of a gene in an individual having no family history of the disease. However it is not well understood why males tend to express the disease more frequently. The disease is expressed at a rate of 80 to 100% of all affected, yet children with <b>Cherubism</b> vary in severity in their maxilla and mandible bony lesions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cause of}} <b>Cherubism</b> is {{believed}} to be from a mutation of gene of SH3BP2. <b>Cherubism</b> has also been found combined with other genetic disorders including Noonan syndrome, Ramon syndrome, and Fragile X syndrome. [...] Mutations of the SH3BP2 gene are only reported in 75% of <b>Cherubism</b> cases. [...] The mutation of the SH3BP2 gene {{is believed to}} increase production of over active proteins from this gene. The SH3BP2 gene is found on the smaller arm of chromosome 4 at position 16.3. [...] The SH3BP2 protein is involved with chemical signaling to immune system cells known as macrophages and B cells.|$|E
5000|$|The disease <b>Cherubism</b> {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} dominant disease of the maxilla and mandible. Approximately 200 cases have been reported by medical journals with the majority being males. <b>Cherubism</b> is usually first diagnosed around age 7 and continues through puberty and {{may or may not}} continue to advance with age. [...] The degrees of <b>Cherubism</b> vary from mild to severe. Osteoclastic and osteoblastic remodeling contributes to the change of normal bone to fibrous tissue and cyst formation. As noted by the name, the patient's face becomes enlarged and disproportionate due to the fibrous tissue and atypical bone formation. The sponge-like bone formations lead to early tooth loss and permanent tooth eruption problems. The disease also affects the orbital area, creating an upturned eye appearance. The cause of <b>cherubism</b> is believed to be traced to a genetic defect resulting from a mutation of the SH3BP2 gene from chromosome 4p16.3. [...] While the disease is rare and painless, the afflicted suffer the emotional trauma of disfigurement. The effects of <b>Cherubism</b> may also interfere with normal jaw motion and speech. Currently, removal of the tissue and bone by surgery is the only treatment available. This disease {{is also one of the}} few that unexpectedly stops and regresses. [...] Normal bone remodeling activity may resume after puberty.|$|E

50|$|SH3BP2 (SH3 domain-binding protein 2) is {{a protein}} {{that comes from}} a gene located on Chromosome 4. SH3BP2 binds {{differentially}} to the SH3 domains of certain proteins of signal transduction pathways. It binds to phosphatidylinositols linking the hemopoietic tyrosine kinase fes to the cytoplasmic membrane in a phosphorylation dependent mechanism. It is also associated with <b>cherubism.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{appearance}} {{of people with}} the disorder {{is caused by a}} loss of bone in the mandible which the body replaces with excessive amounts of fibrous tissue. In most cases, the condition fades as the child grows, but in a few even rarer cases the condition continues to deform the affected person's face. <b>Cherubism</b> also causes premature loss of the primary teeth and uneruption of the permanent teeth.|$|E
50|$|Because {{this disease}} is genetically linked, genetic {{counseling}} {{may be the}} only way to decrease occurrences of <b>Cherubism.</b> The lack of severe symptoms in the parents may be the cause of failure in recognizing the disorder. The optimal time to be tested for mutations is prior to having children. The disease results from a genetic mutation, and this gene has been found to spontaneously mutate. Therefore, there may be no prevention techniques available.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{rarity of}} the disease, it's {{difficult}} to reliably estimate statistics. However, a 2006 study which followed 7 cases over {{an average of}} 8.5 years noted that [...] "In general, <b>cherubism</b> {{does not have a}} poor prognosis. It has been noted that the condition does not progress beyond puberty. As the patient grows to adulthood, the jawbone lesions tend to resolve, and a progressively more normal jaw configuration is noted.".|$|E
5000|$|The {{disease is}} usually {{diagnosed}} when dental abnormalities are found. These abnormalities include premature deciduous teeth and abnormal growth of permanent teeth due to displacement by cysts and lesions. The only definite way to correctly diagnose {{the disease is}} by sequence analysis of the SH3BP2 gene. The gene {{has been found to}} have missense mutation in exon 9. [...] Initial study of the patient is usually conducted using x-ray and CT scans. Neurofibromatosis may resemble <b>Cherubism</b> and may accompany the disease. Genetic testing is the final diagnosis tool.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} SH3BP2 {{mutations}} {{are still under}} study, but researchers believe that the abnormal protein disrupts critical signaling pathways in cells associated with the maintenance of bone tissue and in some immune system cells. The overactive protein likely causes inflammation in the jaw bones and triggers the production of osteoclasts, which are cells that break down bone tissue during bone remodeling. Osteoclasts also sense the increased inflammation of the mandible and maxilla and are further activated to break down bone structures. Bone loss and inflammation lead to increased fibrous tissue and cyst growth. An excess of these bone-eating cells contributes {{to the destruction of}} bone in the upper and lower jaws. A combination of bone loss and inflammation likely underlies the cyst-like growths characteristic of <b>Cherubism.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cherubism</b> is {{displayed}} with genetic conformation and when excessive osteoclasts {{are found in}} the affected areas of the mandible and maxilla. Large cysts will be present with excessive fibrous areas inside the bone. The fibers and cysts will be found among the trabecula of the Coronoid process, the ramus of mandible, the body of mandible and the maxilla regions. The maxilla will be affected up to and including the orbits and sometimes inside the lower orbits. [...] The maxilla and zygomatic bones are depressed and eyes appear to gaze upward. [...] The maxilla {{has been found to be}} more severely affected in most cases than the mandible bone. Some patients found with lower inner orbital growths and cysts may lose vision.|$|E
5000|$|Because <b>Cherubism</b> {{changes and}} {{improves}} {{over time the}} treatment should be individually determined. Generally moderate cases are watched until they subside or progress into the more severe range. Severe cases may require surgery to eliminate bulk cysts and fibrous growth of the maxilla and mandible. Surgical bone grafting of the cranial facial bones may be successful on some patients. Surgery is preferred for patients ages 5 to 15. [...] Special consideration should be taken when operating on the face to avoid the marginal mandibular branch {{of the facial nerve}} as well as the zygomatic branch of the facial nerve. Unintentional damage to these nerves can decrease muscle strength in the face and mandible region. Orthodontic treatment is generally required to avoid permanent dental problems arising from malocclusive bite, misplaced, and unerupted permanent teeth. [...] Orthodontic treatment may be used to erupt permanent teeth that have been unable to descend due to lesions and cysts being in their path of eruption. Patients with orbital issues of diplopia, eye proptosis, and visual loss will require ophthalmologic treatment.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cherubism</b> is {{a benign}} fibro-osseous disease of {{childhood}} limited {{specifically to the}} maxilla and mandible. The progressive replacement of the jaw bones with expansile multilocular cystic lesions causes eventual prominence of the lower face, and hence the classic "cherubic" phenotype reflecting variable extents of jaw hypertrophy. Histologically, this condition has been characterized as replacement of the normal bone matrix with multicystic pockets of fibrous stroma and osteoclastic giant cells. Because of radiographic features common to both, primarily the presence of multiloculated lucencies with heterogeneous "ground-glass" sclerosis on CT imaging, <b>cherubism</b> was long mistaken for a craniofacial subtype of fibrous dysplasia. In 1999, however, the distinct genetic basis for <b>cherubism</b> was mapped to chromosome 4 p 16. 3 and the SH- 3 binding protein SH 3 BP 2.

40|$|SummaryCherubism is an autosomal-dominant {{syndrome}} {{characterized by}} inflammatory destructive bony lesions resulting in symmetrical deformities {{of the facial}} bones. <b>Cherubism</b> is caused by mutations in Sh 3 bp 2, the gene that encodes the adaptor protein 3 BP 2.

A mouse model of <b>cherubism</b> develops hyperactive bone-remodeling osteoclasts and systemic inflammation characterized by expansion of the myelomonocytic lineage. The mechanism by which <b>cherubism</b> mutations alter 3 BP 2 function has remained obscure. Here we show that Tankyrase, {{a member of the}} poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family, regulates 3 BP 2 stability through ADP-ribosylation and subsequent ubiquitylation by the E 3 -ubiquitin ligase RNF 146 in osteoclasts. <b>Cherubism</b> mutations uncouple 3 BP 2 from Tankyrase-mediated protein destruction, which results in its stabilization and subsequent hyperactivation of the SRC, SYK, and VAV signaling pathways...|$|E
