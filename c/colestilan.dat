50|$|<b>Colestilan</b> is a {{cross-linked}} copolymer of 2-methylimidazole and epichlorohydrin {{and works}} as an anion exchanger resin with affinity to phosphate, bile acid anions and urate. It binds these anions in the gut and removes them from the enterohepatic circulation. <b>Colestilan</b> is not absorbed from the gut, but is excreted together with the bound anions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Colestilan</b> is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of hyperphosphataemia (too high phosphate concentrations in the blood serum) in patients undergoing dialysis, including peritoneal dialysis.|$|E

50|$|<b>Colestilan</b> (INN, {{trade name}} BindRen) is a {{medication}} {{that acts as}} a phosphate binder and bile acid sequestrant. It is an ion-exchange resin, is an orally administered bile acid sequestrant that is being developed by Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia and hyperphosphataemia. It has been launched in Japan for hypercholesterolaemia. For the treatment of hyperphosphataemia, it is launched in Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, Portugal and the United Kingdom, is registered in the EU. Phase III development in paediatric patients with hyperphosphataemia associated with chronic kidney disease was underway in the UK and Germany. However, the company discontinued the development. In addition, the phase II development in type-2 diabetes mellitus and phase I development in hyperphosphataemia, in Japan, was also discontinued by the company.|$|E
40|$|Bile acid {{sequestrants}} (BASs) are cholesterollowering {{drugs that}} also affect hyperglycemia. The {{mechanism by which}} BASs exert these and other metabolic effects beyond cholesterol lowering remains poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate {{the effects of a}} BAS, <b>colestilan,</b> on body weight, energy expenditure, and glucose and lipid metabolism and its mechanisms of action in high-fat-fed hyperlipidemic APOE* 3 Leiden (E 3 L) transgenic mice. Mildly insulin-resistant E 3 L mice were fed a high-fat diet with or without 1. 5 % <b>colestilan</b> for 8 weeks. <b>Colestilan</b> treatment decreased body weight, visceral and subcutaneous fat, and plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels but increased food intake. Blood glucose and plasma insulin levels were decreased, and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp analysis demonstrated improved insulin sensitivity, particularly in peripheral tissues. In addition, <b>colestilan</b> decreased energy expenditure and physical activity, whereas it increased the respiratory exchange ratio, indicating that <b>colestilan</b> induced carbohydrate catabolism. Moreover, kinetic analysis revealed that <b>colestilan</b> increased [3 H]NEFA incorporation in biliary cholesterol and phospholipids and increased fecal lipid excretion. Gene expression analysis in liver, fat, and muscle supported the above findings. In summary, <b>colestilan</b> decreases weight gain and improves peripheral insulin sensitivity in high-fat-fed E 3 L mice by enhanced NEFA incorporation in biliary lipids and increased fecal lipid excretion.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{compared}} {{the effects of}} short-term titrated <b>colestilan</b> (a novel non-absorbable, non-calcium, phosphate binder) with placebo, and evaluated the safety and efficacy of <b>colestilan</b> over 1 year compared with sevelamer, in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) 5 D. METHODS: This prospective multicentre study comprised a 4 -week phosphate binder washout period, a 16 -week short-term, flexible-dose, treatment period (including a 4 -week placebo-controlled withdrawal period) and a 40 -week extension treatment phase. RESULTS: At Week 16 (the end of the 4 -week placebo-controlled withdrawal period), serum phosphorus level was 0. 43 mmol/L (1. 32 mg/dL) lower with <b>colestilan</b> than placebo (P < 0. 001; primary end point). Serum LDL-C level was also lower with <b>colestilan</b> than with placebo (P < 0. 001). Both <b>colestilan</b> and sevelamer produced significant reductions from baseline in serum phosphorus levels (P < 0. 001), maintained for 1 year, {{and the proportion of}} patients achieving target levels of ≤ 1. 78 mmol/L (5. 5 mg/dL) or ≤ 1. 95 mmol/L (6. 0 mg/dL) at study end were similar (65. 3 and 73. 3...|$|E
40|$|Background Guidelines {{preferentially}} recommend noncalcium phosphate binders {{in adults}} with {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD). We compare and rank phosphate-binder strategies for CKD. Study Design Network meta-analysis. Setting & Population Adults with CKD. Selection Criteria for Studies Randomized trials with allocation to phosphate binders. Interventions Sevelamer, lanthanum, iron, calcium, <b>colestilan,</b> bixalomer, nicotinic acid, and magnesium. Outcomes The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Additional outcomes were cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, adverse events, serum phosphorus and calcium levels, and coronary artery calcification. Results 77 trials (12, 562 participants) were included. Most (62 trials in 11, 009 patients) studies were performed in a dialysis population. Trials were generally of short duration (median, 6 months) and had high risks of bias. All-cause mortality was ascertained in 20 studies during 86, 744 patient-months of follow-up. There {{was no evidence that}} any drug class lowered mortality or cardiovascular events when compared to placebo. Compared to calcium, sevelamer reduced all-cause mortality (OR, 0. 39; 95 % CI, 0. 21 - 0. 74), whereas treatment effects of lanthanum, iron, and <b>colestilan</b> were not significant (ORs of 0. 78 [95 % CI, 0. 16 - 3. 72], 0. 37 [95 % CI, 0. 09 - 1. 60], and 0. 55 [95 % CI, 0. 07 - 4. 43], respectively). Lanthanum caused nausea, whereas sevelamer posed the highest risk for constipation and iron caused diarrhea. All phosphate binders lowered serum phosphorus levels {{to a greater extent than}} placebo, with iron ranked as the best treatment. Sevelamer and lanthanum posed substantially lower risks for hypercalcemia than calcium. Limitations Limited testing of consistency; short follow-up. Conclusions There is currently no evidence that phosphate-binder treatment reduces mortality compared to placebo in adults with CKD. It is not clear whether the higher mortality with calcium versus sevelamer reflects whether there is net harm associated with calcium, net benefit with sevelamer, both, or neither. Iron-based binders show evidence of greater phosphate lowering that warrants further examination in randomized trials...|$|E
40|$|Bile acids promote bile {{formation}} and facilitate dietary lipid absorption. Animal and human studies showing disturbed bile acid metabolism in diabetes mellitus suggest {{a link between}} bile acids and glucose control. Bile acids are activating ligands of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor with an established role in bile acid and lipid metabolism. Evidence suggests a role for FXR also in maintenance of glucose homeostasis. Animal and human studies employing bile acid sequestrants (bile acid binding agents), which interrupt the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and effectively reduce plasma cholesterol, support a link between bile acid and glucose metabolism. In lipid-lowering trials, bile acid sequestrants, such as colesevelam hydrochloride, colestyramine (cholestyramine) and <b>colestilan</b> (colestimide), have {{also been shown to}} lower plasma glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin levels, suggesting the utility of these agents as a potential therapy for type 2 diabetes. In this article, we review the relationship between bile acid metabolism and glucose homeostasis, and present data demonstrating the utility of bile acid sequestrants in the management of diabetes...|$|E
