5|$|Cattle raising was {{the major}} {{industry}} in the 1840s with sheep becoming predominant in the 1860s. At this time many Victorians settled in the Riverina to breed sheep and <b>cattle</b> <b>to</b> feed the miners {{taking part in the}} Victorian Gold Rush. The herds were considered inferior at first, but these pastures were good for stock, and the land which seemed a desert was actually good fattening country.|$|E
5|$|Settlers {{arrived in}} the area from Bella Coola in the early 1900s to {{establish}} ranches. One particular ranch, the Home Ranch, used the Blackwater Trail between the Ilgachuz and Itcha ranges to carry supplies and <b>cattle</b> <b>to</b> be sold at cattle sales in the small city of Quesnel. Remains of this ranch are still present, {{as well as many}} trails that were used as supply routes.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog was {{developed}} {{for its ability to}} encourage reluctant <b>cattle</b> <b>to</b> travel long distances and may be the best breed in the world for this work. However, some working dog trainers have expressed concern that dogs bred for the show ring are increasingly too short in the legs and too stocky in the body to undertake the work for which they were originally bred.|$|E
40|$|First part: {{meeting at}} the Cabildo. Topic: quarrel about the {{administration}} of the churches cattle ranch. Members of the Cabildo call for a say and participation concerning the administration. They raise their claim because their grandparents donated the first <b>cattles</b> <b>to</b> establish a <b>cattle</b> breeding <b>to</b> maintain the church.

5|$|The {{common eland}} is {{sometimes}} farmed and hunted for its meat, {{and in some}} cases can be better used than cattle because it is more suited to African climates. This has led to some Southern African farmers switching from <b>cattle</b> <b>to</b> eland. Common elands are also pictured as supporters in the coat of arms of Grootfontein, Namibia.|$|E
5|$|Denver {{used to be}} a major trading {{center for}} beef and {{livestock}} when ranchers would drive (or later transport) <b>cattle</b> <b>to</b> the Denver Union Stockyards for sale. As a celebration of that history, {{for more than a century}} Denver has hosted the annual National Western Stock Show, attracting as many as 10,000 animals and 700,000 attendees. The show is held every January at the National Western Complex northeast of downtown.|$|E
5|$|Early in January 1864, the Yavapai raided {{a number}} of ranches that {{supplied}} <b>cattle</b> <b>to</b> the miners in the Prescott and Agua Fria area. As {{a result of this}} and a series of recent killings, a preemptive attack was organized to discourage future depredations. Therefore, a group of well-armed volunteers were quickly outfitted with King S. Woolsey as their leader. Their mission was to track the raiding party back to their rancheria. What followed was an infamous footnote in Arizona history known today as the Bloody Tanks incident.|$|E

40|$|The {{reviewed}} {{case studies}} were conducted between 1994 and 1997 by ILRI research teams in Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria. The objectives were to evaluate farmers' preferences for <b>cattle</b> traits; <b>to</b> assess constraints {{and opportunities for}} in situ conservation of endangered <b>cattle</b> breeds, and <b>to</b> evaluate breed differences in <b>cattle</b> prices <b>to</b> ascertain the signals sent by livestock markets. Farmers' preferences for cattle traits were also examined {{from the perspectives of}} the type of production system or purpose for keeping cattle...|$|R
5|$|George Hall and {{his family}} arrived in the New South Wales Colony in 1802. By 1825, the Halls had {{established}} two cattle stations in the Upper Hunter Valley, and had begun a northward expansion into the Liverpool Plains, New England and Queensland. Getting his <b>cattle</b> <b>to</b> the Sydney markets presented a problem in that thousands of head of cattle had to be moved for thousands of kilometres along unfenced stock routes through sometimes rugged bush and mountain ranges. A note, in his own writing, records Thomas Hall's anger at losing 200 head in scrub.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} to several offices within the Buenos Aires Cabildo in the 1781-1794 period. On April 7, 1789, he helped a number of shoemakers to establish a guild. Although there were several in Spain, no guild constitution from Spain {{was used as a}} model. He promoted the pavement of the streets, and the improvement of the buildings. Supported by the viceroy Nicolás Antonio de Arredondo, he collected $8,000 and provided 500 <b>cattle</b> <b>to</b> mine rocks from the Martín García Island for this work. He married his cousin Justa Rufina de Basavilbaso y Garfias on February 6, 1795.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{prior to}} the {{restructuring}} of the French Limousin Herd Book in 2008, French breeders had two months to nominate the class (Pureblood or Purebred) in which they wanted their <b>cattle</b> <b>to</b> be registered. Pureblood cattle have higher business value than Purebreds because they are preferred by French breeders. Also, Full French cattle benefit under a branded meat marketing label known as Blason Prestige Label Rouge, which has around 800 outlets in France.|$|E

5|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} the central section of New Road from Paddington to Islington {{which opened in}} 1756 as London's first bypass providing a route along which to drive <b>cattle</b> <b>to</b> Smithfield Market avoiding central London. Traffic increased when major railway stations, including Euston, opened in the mid-19th century {{and led to the}} road's renaming in 1857. Euston Road was widened in the 1960s to cater for the increasing demands of motor traffic, and the Euston Tower was built around that time. The road contains several significant buildings including the Wellcome Library, the British Library and the St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel.|$|E
5|$|While some culinary {{practices}} and dishes have been imported from its British neighbors, uniquely Welsh cuisine grew principally from {{the lives of}} Welsh working people, {{largely as a result}} of their isolation from outside culinary influences and the need to produce food based on the limited ingredients they could produce or afford. Welsh Celts and their more recent Welsh descendants originally practiced transhumance, moving their <b>cattle</b> <b>to</b> higher elevations in the summer and back to their home base in the winter. Once they settled to homesteads, a family would have generally eaten meat from a pig primarily, keeping a cow for dairy products.|$|E

5|$|Highland cattle {{were first}} {{imported}} into Australia by {{the mid-19th century}} by Scottish migrants such as Chieftain Areneas Ronaldson MacDonell of Glengarry, Scotland. Arriving in Port Albert, Victoria, in 1841 with his clan, they apparently drove their Highland <b>cattle</b> <b>to</b> a farm at Greenmount, on the Tarra River, preceded by a piper. Samuel Amess, also from Scotland, who made a fortune in the Victorian goldfields and became Mayor of Melbourne in 1869, kept a small fold of black Highland cattle on Churchill Island. They were seen and survived in Port Victoria during the late 1800s, but other folds were believed to have died out {{in areas such as}} New South Wales. In 1988 the Australian Highland Cattle Society was formed. Since then, numbers have been growing and semen is being exported to New Zealand to establish the breed there.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{first arrived}} on the {{southeast}} North American mainland in 1521, brought by Ponce de Leon on his second trip to the region, where they were used by officers, scouts and livestock herders. Later expeditions brought more horses and <b>cattle</b> <b>to</b> Spanish Florida. By the late 16th century, horses were used extensively in the local cattle business and by the late 17th century the industry was flourishing, especially {{in what is now}} northern Florida and southern Georgia. The horses brought to North America by the Spanish and subsequently bred there included Barbs, Garranos, Spanish Jennets, Sorraias, Andalusians and other Iberian breeds. Overall, they were relatively small and had physical traits distinctive of Spanish breeds, including short backs, sloping shoulders, low set tails and wide foreheads.|$|E
5|$|Species {{that are}} morphologically {{similar to the}} broad-billed parrot, such as the {{hyacinth}} macaw and the palm cockatoo, may provide insight into its ecology. Anodorhynchus macaws, which are habitual ground dwellers, eat very hard palm nuts. Carlos Yamashita has suggested that these macaws once depended on now-extinct South American megafauna to eat fruits and excrete the seeds, and that they later relied on domesticated <b>cattle</b> <b>to</b> do this. Similarly, in Australasia the palm cockatoo feeds on undigested seeds from cassowary droppings. Yamashita suggested that the abundant Cylindraspis tortoises and dodos performed the same function on Mauritius, and that the broad-billed parrot, with its macaw-like beak, depended on them to obtain cleaned seeds. Many types of palms and palm-like plants on Mauritius produce hard seeds that the broad-billed parrot may have eaten, including Latania loddigesii, Mimusops maxima, Sideroxylon grandiflorum, Diospyros egrettorium, and Pandanus utilis.|$|E
