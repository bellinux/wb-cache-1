50|$|From Newton, {{force can}} be defined as an {{exertion}} or pressure which can <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> object to accelerate. The concept of force is used to describe <b>an</b> influence which <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> free body (object) to accelerate. It can be a push or <b>a</b> pull, which <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> object to change direction, have new velocity, or to deform temporarily or permanently. Generally speaking, force <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> object's state of motion to change.|$|R
50|$|The anti-RhE {{antibody}} {{is quite}} common especially in the Rh genotype CDe/CDe; It usually only <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> mild hemolytic disease, but can <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> severe condition in the newborn. It can occur with other antibodies, usually the anti-Rhc antibody, which can also <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> severe hemolytic disease.|$|R

5|$|Estimates {{ranged from}} 400 to 700 to 900 {{unauthorized}} file disclosures. The incident <b>caused</b> <b>an</b> intense burst of criticism {{because many of}} the files covered White House employees from previous Republican administrations, including top figures such as James Baker, Brent Scowcroft, and Marlin Fitzwater.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s {{the breed}} enjoyed much success because the beef market demanded low input (feed) cattle with high quality meat. However, the BSE crisis (commonly {{referred}} to as mad cow disease) <b>caused</b> <b>an</b> export ban in 1990, although there were no cases of BSE found in Galloway cattle. This created a fear associated with cattle, so breed numbers declined.|$|E
5|$|Large {{areas of}} Earth's surface {{are subject to}} extreme weather such as {{tropical}} cyclones, hurricanes, or typhoons that dominate life in those areas. From 1980 to 2000, these events <b>caused</b> <b>an</b> average of 11,800 human deaths per year. Many places are subject to earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, sinkholes, blizzards, floods, droughts, wildfires, and other calamities and disasters.|$|E
50|$|Alkalis {{added to}} indium sulfate {{solutions}} precipitate basic salts. For example, potassium hydroxide produces either a basic sulfate, 2 In2O3.SO3•nH2O, or KIn3(OH)6(SO4)2 depending on pH. Sodium pyrophosphate <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> slimy precipitate of indium pyrophosphate, In4(P2O7)3•3H2O. Potassium periodate <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> precipitate of a basic indium periodate, 2 InO5•In(OH)3•6 H2O. Oxalic acid <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> precipitate of indium oxalate, In2(C2O4)3•10 H2O. Alkali oxalates <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> precipitate of the alkali dioxalatoindate to form: MIn(C2O4)2•3 H2O where M=Na, K or NH4.|$|R

5|$|Many of {{the mobile}} homes {{were able to}} be remounted on their foundations, but 18–20 of the homes were unable to be repaired. The overall damage from the event was {{compared}} with the other events in southern California. While the Oceanside shock caused $200,000 in damage, the Palm Springs event <b>caused</b> <b>an</b> estimated $8 million in damage. Damage in from the Chalfant Valley event was estimated at $2.7 million.|$|E
5|$|On Saipan, Typhoon Joan {{destroyed}} 37houses and <b>caused</b> <b>an</b> island-wide power outage. Three {{people were}} injured due to boarding up their house during the storm. On nearby Anatahan, high winds caused $200,000 (1997USD) worth of crop and property damage. Later, high waves affected southern Japan and northwestern Hawaii. On Chichi-jima, Joan caused a boat to capsize, killing one of its occupants and leaving two others missing.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Hurricane Mitch <b>caused</b> <b>an</b> {{estimated}} $3.8billion in damage, {{of which}} $2.005billion was from direct damages {{and the remainder}} from indirect costs. The overall impact represented about 70% of Honduras's annual gross domestic product (GDP).|$|E
5000|$|Activation of an endocytic pathway: The {{antibody}} activates <b>a</b> pathway which <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> internalization of desmogleïn 1, {{which in}} turn <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> loss of adhesion.|$|R

5|$|Phoenixs {{first call}} to action came on April 2, 1955. A four-alarm blaze at the Ferry Building greatly damaged {{the north end of}} the building; losses came to $750,000. Other notable fires that Phoenix fought include Pier 70 burning in 1980, and a lengthy battle at Piers 30–32 {{throughout}} the night of May 9–10, 1984—a five-alarm explosive conflagration which destroyed the piers and <b>caused</b> <b>an</b> estimated $2.5million in damage.|$|E

5|$|After taking {{only seven}} wickets at 61.00 {{in the first}} four Tests, Johnson was dropped for the Fifth Test at The Oval; Ring {{replaced}} him as the team's spinner. English skipper Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, which was regarded as a surprising move by the majority of the press corps. Precipitation in the previous week <b>caused</b> <b>an</b> extremely wet outfield, which meant that the Test could not start until midday had passed. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton speculated that the Australians would have bowled if they had won the toss.|$|E
5|$|American {{forces in}} Iraq were {{withdrawn}} {{in large numbers}} in 2009 and 2010, {{and the war in}} the region was declared formally over in December 2011.

In 2014, Obama announced a restoration of full diplomatic relations with Cuba {{for the first time since}} 1961. The next year, the United States as a member of the P5+1 countries signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an agreement aimed to slow the development of Iran's nuclear program.|$|E
50|$|If an {{aircraft}} in flight suffers a disturbance in pitch that <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> increase (or decrease) in angle of attack, {{it is desirable}} that the aerodynamic forces on the aircraft <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> decrease (or increase) in angle of attack so that the disturbance does not <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> continuous increase (or decrease) in angle of attack. This is longitudinal static stability.|$|R
