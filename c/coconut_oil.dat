40|$|The general {{objectives}} of a multinational project {{funded by the}} EC under the INCO-DEV program are (i) to provide the methodological basis and molecular tools for improving the breeding efficiency in <b>coconut</b> and <b>oil</b> palm; and (ii) to develop DNA marker-based breeding strategies {{in collaboration with the}} most important countries in <b>coconut</b> and <b>oil</b> palm production and (iii) to directly transfer to developing countries small-scale technological solutions for the genetic improvement of these tropical oil crops. This is being achieved through the construction of high-density molecular linkage maps in <b>coconut</b> and <b>oil</b> palm by developing SSR, AFLP and SNP markers, by performing comparative QTL analyses, by developing user-friendly molecular marker sets for future practical applications, and by synteny studies for <b>coconut</b> and <b>oil</b> palm in terms of comparative genome (microsequencing, SSR synteny) and QTL analyses. In the frame of these activities, cosmid libraries for <b>coconut</b> and <b>oil</b> palm representing some 2. 3 - 2. 5 genome equivalents were individualized, spotted onto filters and used in the isolation of important genes (oil biosynthesis, putative resistance genes). Different PCR-based DNA marker types were established to construct linkage maps fo...|$|R
5000|$|Sodium laureth sulfate {{is derived}} from <b>coconut</b> <b>oils</b> and is used to soften water and create a lather.

5|$|In Thailand, durian {{is often}} eaten fresh with sweet sticky rice, and blocks of durian paste {{are sold in}} the markets, though much of the paste is {{adulterated}} with pumpkin. Unripe durians may be cooked as a vegetable, except in the Philippines, where all uses are sweet rather than savoury. Malaysians make both sugared and salted preserves from durian. When durian is minced with salt, onions and vinegar, it is called boder. The durian seeds, which are the size of chestnuts, can be eaten whether they are boiled, roasted or fried in <b>coconut</b> <b>oil,</b> with a texture {{that is similar to}} taro or yam, but stickier. In Java, the seeds are sliced thin and cooked with sugar as a confection. Uncooked durian seeds are potentially toxic due to cyclopropene fatty acids and should not be ingested.|$|E
5|$|The Roce (anointing) ceremony, {{conducted}} one or {{two days}} before a wedding, celebrates the last day of virginity of the bride and bridegroom and involves the parents' blessing of the bride and groom, who are anointed with roce, a mixture of coconut milk and <b>coconut</b> <b>oil,</b> while a cross is inscribed on the bride's forehead. The marriage traditions include Soirik (betrothal), exchange of Paan Pod (betel leaves) during the marriage ceremony, which known as Badalchen (changing hands; formal acceptance of the promise made by the bride's father to the bridegroom's father that he will give his daughter in marriage). The bride is adorned with the Sado (wedding sari) and Pirduk (wedding necklace). Other rites include the Onpnni (giving away the bride formally by the father or the guardian of the bride), Porthoponn (re-invitation to the bride's house), and singing of Honvious (hymns). Some non-marriage traditions include Novemjeevon (partaking of the food prepared from new corn) and Novem (blessing of new harvests).|$|E
5|$|Through {{the late}} 17th century, the various clans {{of the eastern}} coastal region were governed by chieftains who {{typically}} ruled over one or two villages. A zana-malata named Ratsimilaho emerged to unite these clans under his rule in 1710. His reign lasted 50 years and established a sense of common identity and stability throughout the kingdom, but his successors gradually weakened this union, leaving it vulnerable to the growing influence and presence of European and particularly French settlers, slave traders, missionaries and merchants. The fractured Betsimisaraka kingdom was easily colonised in 1817 by Radama I, king of Imerina who ruled from its capital at Antananarivo in the central highlands. The subjugation of the Betsimisaraka in the 19th century left the population relatively impoverished; under colonisation by the French (1896-1960) a focused {{effort was made to}} increase access to education and paid employment working on French plantations. Production of former plantation crops like vanilla, ylang-ylang, <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> and coffee remain the principal economic activity of the region beyond subsistence farming and fishing, although mining is also a source of income.|$|E

5|$|The Hindu elite {{follow the}} {{religious}} ideology of Shaiva Siddhanta (Shaiva school) while masses practice folk Hinduism, upholding {{their faith in}} local village deities not found in formal Hindu scriptures. The place of worship depends on the object of worship {{and how it is}} housed. It could be a proper Hindu temple known as a Koyil, constructed according to the Agamic scripts (a set of scriptures regulating the temple cult). More often, however, the temple is not completed in accordance with Agamic scriptures but consists of the barest essential structure housing a local deity. These temples observe daily Puja (prayers) hours and are attended by locals. Both types of temples have a resident ritualist or priest known as a Kurukkal. A Kurukkal may belong to someone from a prominent local lineage like Pandaram or Iyer community. In the Eastern Province, a Kurukkal usually belongs to Lingayat sect. Other places of worship do not have icons for their deities. The sanctum could house a trident (culam), a stone, or a large tree. Temples of this type are common in the Northern and Eastern Provinces; a typical village has up to 150 such structures. The offering would be done by an elder of the family who owns the site. A <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> lamp would be lit on Fridays, and a special rice dish known as pongal would be cooked either on a day considered auspicious by the family or on the Thai Pongal day, and possibly on Tamil New Year Day.|$|E

25|$|Copra has {{traditionally}} been grated and ground then boiled in water to extract <b>coconut</b> <b>oil.</b> It was used by Pacific island cultures and became a valuable commercial product for merchants in the South Seas and South Asia in the 1860s. This 19th-century copra trading inspired Robert Louis Stevenson's 1893 novella The Beach of Falesá, based on his experiences in Samoa. Nowadays, the process of <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> extraction is performed by crushing copra to produce <b>coconut</b> <b>oil</b> (70%); the by-product is known as copra cake or copra meal (30%).|$|E

25|$|<b>Coconut</b> <b>oil</b> can be {{extracted}} using either mechanical expellers or solvents (hexane). Mechanically expelled copra meal is of higher feeding value, {{because it contains}} typically 8–12% oil, whereas the solvent-extracted copra meal contains only 2–4% oil. Premium quality copra meal can also contain 20–22% crude protein, and <20ppb aflatoxin.|$|E

Common ingredients used as substitutes for either dairy or meat ingredients include soy and tofu, palm and <b>coconut</b> <b>oils,</b> and various vegetables. Meat analogues are used to replace real meat in recipes, and soy cheese to replace real cheese. Some meat analogues (such as those made by Morningstar Farms) include dairy.|$|R
