40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{complexity}} of chronic diseases {{is a challenge}} for investigators conducting randomized trials. The causes for this include the often difficult control for confounding, the selection of outcomes from many potentially important outcomes, the risk of missing data with long follow-up and the detection of heterogeneity of treatment effects. Our aim was to assess such aspects of trial design and analysis for four prevalent chronic diseases. METHODS: We included 161 randomized trials on drug and non-drug treatments for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, stroke and heart failure, which were included in current Cochrane reviews. We assessed whether these trials defined a single outcome or several primary outcomes, statistically compared baseline characteristics to assess <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> groups, reported on between-group comparisons, and we also assessed how they handled missing data and whether appropriate methods for subgroups effects were used.

40|$|Quantifying {{the impact}} of a social program {{requires}} sound experimental designs and sound statistical analyses. Generating accurate and unbiased treatment estimates requires <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> and control units. Ideally, individual units should be randomly assigned to the treatment or control groups so that pre-treatment differences are negated. Pragmatic and ethical considerations often prohibit random assignment. When random assignment is not available, propensity score matching is a useful tool for constructing a comparable control group. Often the number of potential control units far exceeds the number of treatment units. A single treatment unit may be matched with many control units. A common practice is to randomly select one of the potential control matches, create a control group with the same number of treatment units, and perform statistical analyses on this matched control-treatment sample. However, sometimes conclusion may vary with a different sample. This paper proposes an alternative: Use multiple sampling to generate treatment effect when a single treatment unit is matched to numerous controls. Multiple random sampling...|$|E
40|$|Background: So far {{no studies}} have been {{conducted}} on the issue <b>of</b> <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> rehabilitation <b>treatment</b> profiles and patient characteristics across countries. These aspects might have implications for the feasibility of treating patients abroad but also for the comparison <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> outcome on an international level. Objective: This study attempts to compare the patient characteristics and treatment profiles in six European countries of two rehabilitation categories (chronic low back pain (CLBP) and stroke) and to reveal possible consequences for international treatment and multi-centre studies. Design: Cross-sectional study comparing demographic variables, treatment profiles, generic health (SF- 36) and disabilities (RDQ for CLBP and the Barthel index for stroke) in six European countries. Subjects: 255 patients with CLBP and 246 patients with stroke, treated in 36 different institutions in Austria (AUT), Finland (FIN), Germany (GER), Ireland (IR), Italy (IT) and The Netherlands (NL). Results: The <b>treatment</b> profiles <b>of</b> CLBP patients show marked differences between countries and three categories <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> can be distinguished: (a) predominant physiotherapy (IR, IT), (b) all disciplines equally provided (NL, GER, AUS) and (c) treatment concentrated in four disciplines (FIN). Striking differences are also found for patient characteristics, characterised by in particular the younger and more disabled Dutch patients and the older and less disabled (mostly female) Italian patients. International stroke rehabilitation was more similar between countries; however, a few differences in patient characteristics were found which again could mostly be ascribed to the Dutch and Italian patients. Conclusion: International treatment and outcome assessment of CLBP patients is not possible unless standardisation is considered <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> content and patient selection. For stroke treatment international traffic and multi-centre outcome assessment might be more feasible...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a two-center {{clinical}} trial with the aim to assess the <b>treatment</b> effects <b>of</b> implant-retained mandibular overdentures versus conventional complete dentures. Treatment had been assigned according to a balanced allocation method. The following criteria were used to enhance the <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>treatment</b> groups: age, gender, the edentulous period of the mandible, the number of previously made mandibular dentures, {{the number of years}} having worn the present mandibular denture and the symphyseal bone height. 151 patients with severely resorbed mandibles participated in the study, they were treated at two centers. Ninety-one patients received an implant-retained mandibular overdenture (IRO) and 60 patients a conventional complete denture (CD). Since some patients refused the allocated treatment the ''Intention To Treat'' principle was applied. This implies that patients are evaluated in the originally allocated <b>treatment</b> group regardless <b>of</b> the actual <b>treatment</b> they received. Patient's experiences were evaluated before treatment and 1 yr after insertion of the new dentures. Results before treatment showed that both treatment groups were comparable: they were dissatisfied with their mandibular denture and they could hardly chew tough or hard foods. One year after insertion of the new dentures the IRO-group was satisfied with their mandibular denture, whereas only one third of the CD-group was satisfied. With respect to the chewing ability the IRO-group scored significantly better than the CD-group (P {{less than or equal to}} 0. 0001) ...|$|R

Although the essential properties of the favorable two one-sided tests of equivalence have been addressed in the literature, the associated power and sample size calculations were illustrated mainly for selecting the most appropriate approximate method. Moreover, conventional power analysis does not consider the allocation restrictions and cost issues of different sample size choices. To extend the practical usefulness of the two one-sided tests procedure, this article describes exact approaches to sample size determinations under various allocation and cost considerations. Because the presented features are not generally available in common software packages, both R and SAS computer codes are presented to implement the suggested power and sample size computations for planning equivalence studies. The exact power function of the TOST procedure is employed to compute optimal sample sizes under four design schemes allowing for different allocation and cost concerns. The proposed power and sample size methodology should be useful for medical sciences to plan equivalence studies...|$|E

40|$|Chronic wounds have a {{great variety}} of etiologies and manifestations that {{influence}} wound healing. Such heterogeneity potentially threatens the validity and clinical usefulness of trials if not considered appropriately. In 82 randomized wound trials retrieved from 10 Cochrane reviews, we assessed if and how authors considered wound and other prognostically important characteristics in the conduct and analysis of wound trials. We assessed whether these characteristics were discussed, reflected in the eligibility criteria, used for prestratification or for adjustments to ensure <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> groups, and whether subgroup analyses were conducted to identify heterogeneity of treatment effects. Nine percent of all trials explicitly discussed characteristics that influence wound healing in the introduction and 43 % in the Discussion section. Ninety percent of trials had at least one prognostically important characteristic as eligibility criterion. Only 11 % of trials used prestratification, and 6 % adjusted the results for imbalances between treatment groups. Twenty-seven percent performed subgroup analyses with prognostically important characteristics defining subgroups. Chronic wound trials use simple randomization, but rarely adapt the study design and analysis to take the heterogeneity of patients into consideration. Collaborative multicenter trials would overcome many of the limitations and provide statistical power to detect important treatment effects both overall and in subgroups...|$|E
30|$|There are a number {{of reasons}} why social {{experiments}} are preferable to nonexperimental evaluations. In the simplest terms, the objective in an evaluation of a social program is to observe the outcome for an intervention for the participants with and without the intervention. Because {{it is impossible to}} observe the same person in two states of the world at the same time, we must rely on some alternative approach to estimate what would have happened to participants had they not been in the program. The simplest and most effective way to assure <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>treatment</b> and control groups is to randomly assign the potential participants to either receive the treatment or be denied the treatment; with a sufficiently large sample size, the treatment and control groups are likely to be identical on all characteristics that might affect the outcome. Nonexperimental evaluation approaches generally seek to provide unbiased and consistent impact estimates either by using mechanisms to develop comparison groups that are as similar as possible to the treatment group (e.g., propensity score matching) or by using econometric approaches to control for observed and unobserved omitted variables (e.g., fixed effects models, instrumental variables, ordinary least squares regression analysis, and regression discontinuity designs). Unfortunately, all the nonexperimental approaches require strong assumptions to assure that unbiased estimates are obtained, and these assumptions are not always testable.|$|R

The study questions focus on {{consistency of the}} prescribing practice with the <b>treatment</b> guidelines; <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>treatment</b> patterns among both countries, and burden of hypertension cost to the population and third party payer in the countries under consideration. Methods: Retrospective study, one year time horizon is for outpatient therapy. Results: Patients with arterial hypertension in Bulgaria are most often on monotherapy (61 % vs 6 % in Serbia), {{as well as those}} with complications (66 % vs 0 % Serbia). In both countries the first choice of therapy are the ACE inhibitors (37. 01 % in Serbia and 41 % in Bulgaria) and then follows the calcium antagonists, beta-blockers, and diuretics. The weighed monthly cost of hypertension and complicated hypertension is almost doubled in Serbia (12. 56 vs 8. 23 EUR for hypertension, and 13. 39 vs 8. 23 EUR) and prevailing part is reimbursed (88 % vs 44 % in Bulgaria). Conclusion: Our study confirms that hypertension and its complications therapy consumes a huge amount of financial resources. In both countries under consideration the therapy is corresponding with the European treatment guidelines. The international cost comparisons are possible but they depend on many external factors as the regulatory measures, prescribing habits and reimbursement policy and should be analysed within this framework...|$|R

We analyzed 8 studies that compared survival rates associated with adjunct exchange transfusion with those associated with antimalarial chemo-therapy alone. Exchange transfusion {{was not associated with}} a higher survival rate than was antimalarial chemotherapy alone (odds ratio [OR], 1. 2; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 7 – 2. 1). However, patients who received transfusions had higher levels of parasitemia and more-severe malaria. Sensitivity analysis found that survival rates were higher among patients with partial immunity to malaria (OR, 0. 5; 95 % CI, 0. 2 – 1. 2) than they were among patients with no immunity (OR, 2. 1; 95 % CI, 0. 9 – 4. 8;).

Method: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Eric, HealthStar, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for potentially relevant articles. The bibliographies of relevant articles were searched for additional references and experts were consulted. Seventeen reports (8 open and 12 randomized trials; 3 articles reported studies of 2 designs) met the following inclusion criteria: original investigation; published in English or French, use of acknowledged criteria or scale for depression, and open or randomized trial of androgen treatment. Four criteria assessed study validity: randomization, double blinding, <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> and control groups at baseline, and description of dropouts. We abstracted, tabulated, and compared information from each article. Results: Most studies had methodological limitations. With regard to feasibility, there were few reported withdrawals due to adverse events. With regard to effectiveness, 6 of 8 open trials had positive results, and 5 of 12 randomized trials had positive results, although 1 was equivocal. However, testosterone was combined with antidepressant medication in 3 of these positive randomized trials. Only 2 open trials enrolled subjects whose mean age was 60 years or over.

40|$|We {{reviewed}} 21 studies (8 blinded and 13 open) on {{the treatment}} of botulinum toxin type A for cervical dystonia, directed to the health aspects {{used to evaluate the}} patients' response to treatment (Medline search 1985 - 1993, English language literature). The prerequisite for comparing the treatment results was that studies had to evaluate similar aspects of disease. The ICIDH model, outlined by the World Health Organization in 1980, orders the different health outcomes into distinct classes of disease consequences. Our aim was to order the health outcomes according to the model and, thus, to study the <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> outcomes. Three differences could be identified between the objective and the subjective instruments. (a) The aspects measured by the subjective instruments varied substantially; of the 22 different subjective instruments identified in 18 studies, 8 measured impairments, 5 disability, and 9 could not be classified according to the ICIDH model. The objective instruments measured impairments. (b) All objective instruments were multiitem, whereas only 2 of 22 subjective instruments could be identified as multiitem. (c) The subjective instruments were generally poorly documented with regard to the number of items, score range, or grading. We conclude that the treatment outcomes can only be compared on the objective level of assessment and with regard to the patients with painful dystonia. The subjective instruments, particularly those focusing on disease-specific disability, deserve further research. The ICIDH model offers a useful framework for selection, improvement, and development of outcome instruments. Because the model clearly demarcates the different consequences of disease, adoption will enhance the comparability of outcomes in cervical dystonia intervention trial...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the physical presence of wind turbines on residential well-being in Germany, using panel data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and a unique novel panel data set on more than 20, 000 wind turbines for the time period between 2000 and 2012. Using a Geographical Information System (GIS), we calculate the proximity between households and the nearest wind turbine as the most important determinant of their disamenities, e. g. visual interference into landscape aesthetics. Our unique novel panel data set on wind turbines, which was collected at the regional level, includes their exact geographical coordinates and construction dates. This allows estimating the causal effect of the physical presence of wind turbines on residential well-being, using a difference-in-differences design. To ensure <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>treatment</b> and control group, we apply propensity-score and novel spatial matching techniques based on exogenous weather data and geographical locations of residence, respectively. We show that the construction of a wind turbine within a <b>treatment</b> radius <b>of</b> 4, 000 metres around households has a significantly negative effect on life satisfaction. For larger treatment radii, no negative externalities can be detected. Moreover, the effect is transitory, vanishing after five years at the latest.

Methods: We used minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB), off-pump bypass surgery, cost-effectiveness, economic analysis, and related keywords to search MEDLINE, other literature databases and article reference lists for English-language economic analyses of minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass procedures versus other procedures that were published from 1990 to February 2002. We critically appraised article adherence to a 10 -item methodologic checklist modified to address issues particularly relevant to minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass evaluations. Assessment discordance was reconciled by consensus. Results: Ten articles published from June 1997 to March 2001 compared costs and (generally) outcomes of minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass with those of other procedures. All were nonrandomized comparisons, generally of concurrent intrainstitutional clinical series. Stated results generally favored minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass, angioplasty, or off-pump bypass surgery through a sternotomy relative to conventional coronary artery bypass grafting. Studies adequately addressed an average of only 24 % of applicable checklist items (range 0 %- 67 %). Few studies adequately ensured the <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> groups, clearly performed intent-to-treat analyses, comprehensively and credibly measured costs that were considered, or clearly addressed costs and results of preprocedural angiography or postprocedural imaging. Only 1 study compared success of revascularization between minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass and competing alternatives. No studies specified the cost-analysis perspective or included costs of physician or physician assistant care. Conclusions: Most published comparative economic analyses of minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass have failed to adequately address issues crucial to such evaluations.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{complexity}} of chronic diseases {{is a challenge}} for investigators conducting randomized trials. The causes for this include the often difficult control for confounding, the selection of outcomes from many potentially important outcomes, the risk of missing data with long follow-up and the detection of heterogeneity of treatment effects. Our aim was to assess such aspects of trial design and analysis for four prevalent chronic diseases. Methods We included 161 randomized trials on drug and non-drug treatments for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, stroke and heart failure, which were included in current Cochrane reviews. We assessed whether these trials defined a single outcome or several primary outcomes, statistically compared baseline characteristics to assess <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> groups, reported on between-group comparisons, and we also assessed how they handled missing data and whether appropriate methods for subgroups effects were used. Results We found that only 21 % of all chronic disease trials had a single primary outcome, whereas 33 % reported one or more primary outcomes. Two of the fifty-one trials that tested for statistical significance of baseline characteristics adjusted the comparison for a characteristic that was significantly different. Of the 161 trials, 10 % reported a within-group comparison only; 17 % (n = 28) of trials reported how missing data were handled (50 % (n = 14) carried forward last values, 27 % (n = 8) performed a complete case analysis, 13 % (n = 4) used a fixed value imputation and 10 % (n = 3) used more advanced methods); and 27 % of trials performed a subgroup analysis but only 23 % of them (n = 10) reported an interaction test. Drug trials, trials published after wide adoption of the CONSORT (CONsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement (2001 or later) and trials in journals with higher impact factors {{were more likely to}} report on some of these aspects of trial design and analysis. Conclusion Our survey showed that an alarmingly large proportion of chronic disease trials do not define a primary outcome, do not use appropriate methods for subgroup analyses, or use naïve methods to handle missing data, if at all. As a consequence, biases are likely to be introduced in many trials on widely prescribed treatments for patients with chronic disease. </p...|$|E

BackgroundDespite {{the improved}} pharmacokinetic characteristics of Neoral, some centers have encountered {{difficulty with the}} conversion of some patients from Sandimmune to Neoral and have reported precipitation of toxicity and rejection. MethodsWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter prospective study of stable maintenance renal transplant patients to compare the safety and tolerability of converting from Sandimmune to Neoral (N = 132) versus continuing Sandimmune (N = 130). Patients were studied for one year. The cyclosporine (CsA) dose was adjusted as necessary to maintain site-specific trough whole blood levels. ResultsDuring the study, dose adjustments were frequent in both groups: 67 % Neoral versus 65 % Sandimmune patients. At study completion, the mean trough CsA levels were comparable; the dose change-from-baseline did not differ statistically between groups. Fewer Neoral (87. 1 %) than Sandimmune (95. 4 %) patients reported adverse events, and serious adverse events were comparable. Adverse events related to CsA were not {{more common in the}} Neoral group. Renal function measures also implied <b>comparability</b> <b>of</b> the two <b>treatments.</b> Three Neoral versus five Sandimmune patients experienced acute rejection; two Neoral versus five Sandimmune patients experienced chronic graft dysfunction.
