2500|$|The {{advantages}} of genetic adjuvants are their low cost and simple administration, {{as well as}} avoidance of unstable recombinant cytokines and potentially toxic, “conventional” adjuvants (such as alum, calcium phosphate, monophosphoryl lipid A, cholera toxin, cationic and mannan-coated liposomes, QS21, <b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulose and ubenimix). However, the potential toxicity of prolonged cytokine expression is not [...] established. In many commercially important animal species, cytokine genes have not been identified and isolated. In addition, various plasmid-encoded cytokines modulate the immune system differently according to the delivery time. For example, some cytokine plasmid DNAs are best delivered after immunogen pDNA, because pre- or co-delivery can decrease specific responses and increase non-specific responses.|$|E
2500|$|Hydrogels {{have been}} {{extensively}} studied, {{mainly in the}} entrapment of small molecules for drug delivery, including cases where the hydrogel nanoparticles slowly release the drug to a targeted site. Hydrogels can be classified [...] according their polymers constituents, which can be natural (Hyaluronan, alginic acid, pectin, , chondroitin sulfate, dextran and dextran [...] sulphate, chitosan, polylysine, [...] collagen, <b>carboxymethyl</b> chitin, fibrin, agarose, pullulan), or synthetic (PEG, PLA, PLGA, PCL, PHB, PVA, PNVP, P(HEMA), p(biscarboxy-phenoxy-phosphazene), p(GEMA-sulfate), and others), or a hybrid of the two. In addition to organic hydrogels there are sol-gels, which are oxygen-bridged silicates (or titanium oxide), that polymerise in water. An additional classification can be by method of polymerization, which can be physical (freezing or heating) or chemical (γ-ray, oxygen or photo-induced radical polymerization {{in the case of}} acrylates, vinyls and acrylamides).|$|E
2500|$|Polyelectrolytes {{have many}} applications, mostly related to modifying flow and {{stability}} properties of aqueous solutions and gels. For instance, {{they can be}} used to destabilize a colloidal suspension and to initiate flocculation (precipitation). They {{can also be used to}} impart a surface charge to neutral particles, enabling them to be dispersed in aqueous solution. They are thus often used as thickeners, emulsifiers, conditioners, clarifying agents, and even drag reducers. They are used in water treatment and for oil recovery. Many soaps, shampoos, and cosmetics incorporate polyelectrolytes. Furthermore, they are added to many foods and to concrete mixtures (superplasticizer). Some of the polyelectrolytes that appear on food labels are pectin, carrageenan, alginates, and <b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulose. All but the last [...] are of natural origin. Finally, they are used in a variety of materials, including cement.|$|E
5000|$|Conventional linear gels. These gels are {{cellulose}} derivative (<b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, <b>carboxymethyl</b> hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl methyl cellulose), guar or its derivatives (hydroxypropyl guar, <b>carboxymethyl</b> hydroxypropyl guar), {{mixed with}} other chemicals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carboxymethyl</b> {{cellulose}} (CMC) or {{cellulose gum}} is a cellulose derivative with <b>carboxymethyl</b> groups (-CH2-COOH) bound {{to some of}} the hydroxyl groups of the glucopyranose monomers that make up the cellulose backbone. It is often used as its sodium salt, sodium <b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulose.|$|E
50|$|In its largest-scale application, {{chloroacetic acid}} {{is used to}} prepare the {{thickening}} agent <b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulose and <b>carboxymethyl</b> starch.|$|E
5000|$|Crosslinked polymers: {{crosslinked}} polyvinylpyrrolidone (crospovidone), crosslinked sodium <b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulose (croscarmellose sodium).|$|E
50|$|E468 is the E {{number of}} {{crosslinked}} sodium <b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulose, used in food as an emulsifier.|$|E
50|$|The sodium <b>carboxymethyl</b> {{cellulose}} can be cross-linked to {{give the}} croscarmellose sodium (E468) {{for use as a}} disintegrant in pharmaceutical formulations.|$|E
50|$|SBR is {{also used}} as a binder in {{lithium-ion}} battery electrodes, in combination with <b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulose as a water-based alternative for, e.g. polyvinylidene fluoride.|$|E
50|$|As a raw {{material}} of cellulose derivatives, dissolving pulp {{is used in}} <b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulose (CMC), methyl cellulose (MC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), etc.|$|E
50|$|A {{multitude}} of different mediums {{are used for}} the stationary phase. Among the most common immobilized charged groups used are trimethylaminoethyl (TAM), triethylaminoethyl (TEAE), diethyl-2-hydroxypropylaminoethyl (QAE), aminoethyl (AE), diethylaminoethyl (DEAE), sulpho (S), sulphomethyl (SM), sulphopropyl (SP), carboxy (C), and <b>carboxymethyl</b> (CM).|$|E
50|$|Pentetic acid or {{diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid}} (DTPA) is an aminopolycarboxylic acid {{consisting}} of a diethylenetriamine backbone with five <b>carboxymethyl</b> groups. The molecule {{can be viewed as}} an expanded version of EDTA and is used similarly. It is a white, water-soluble solid.|$|E
50|$|While {{thought to}} be uncommon, case reports of severe {{reactions}} to <b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulose exist. In one such instance, a woman was known to experience anaphylaxis following exposure. Skin testing {{is believed to be}} a useful diagnostic tool for this purpose.|$|E
5000|$|Viscosity {{modification}} - emulgents like acacia and tragacanth, {{which are}} hydrocolloids, {{as well as}} PEG (or polyethylene glycol), glycerine, and other polymers like CMC (<b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulose), all increase the viscosity of the medium, which helps create and maintain the suspension of globules of dispersed phase ...|$|E
50|$|The {{functional}} properties of CMC {{depend on the}} degree of substitution of the cellulose structure (i.e., how many of the hydroxyl groups have taken part in the substitution reaction), as well as the chain length of the cellulose backbone structure and the degree of clustering of the <b>carboxymethyl</b> substituents.|$|E
50|$|Possible {{adverse effects}} of <b>carboxymethyl</b> {{cellulose}} and similar lubricants include eye pain, irritation, continued redness, and vision changes. Use should be discontinued {{if any of them}} occur. Side effects of hydroxypropyl cellulose include hyperaemia, photophobia, stickiness of eyelashes, discomfort, and irritation. However, the overall side-effect profile of artificial tears is very low.|$|E
50|$|DMT {{is used in}} the {{production}} of polyesters, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT), and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT). It consists of benzene substituted with <b>carboxymethyl</b> groups (CO2CH3) at the 1 and 4 positions. Because DMT is volatile, it is an intermediate in some schemes for the recycling of PET, e.g. from plastic bottles.|$|E
50|$|Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, 3-IAA) is {{the most}} common, {{naturally}} occurring, plant hormone of the auxin class. It is {{the best known of}} the auxins, and {{has been the subject of}} extensive studies by plant physiologists. IAA is a derivative of indole, containing a <b>carboxymethyl</b> substituent. It is a colorless solid that is soluble in polar organic solvents.|$|E
50|$|Preparations contain <b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulose, {{polyvinyl}} alcohol, {{hydroxypropyl methylcellulose}} (a.k.a. HPMC or hypromellose), hydroxypropyl cellulose and hyaluronic acid (a.k.a. hyaluronan, HA) They contain water, salts and polymers but lack the proteins found in natural tears. Patients who use them {{more frequently than}} once every three hours should choose a brand without preservatives or one with non-irritating preservatives.|$|E
50|$|PVP-I can {{be loaded}} into hydrogels, {{which can be}} based on <b>carboxymethyl</b> {{cellulose}} (CMC), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and gelatin, or on crosslinked polyacrylamide. These hydrogels {{can be used for}} wound dressing. The rate of release of the iodine in the PVP-I is heavily dependent on the hydrogel composition: it increases with more CMC/PVA and decreases with more gelatin.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of transferases, {{specifically}} those acyltransferases that convert acyl groups into alkyl groups on transfer. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:2-oxoglutarate C-acetyltransferase (thioester-hydrolysing, <b>carboxymethyl</b> forming). Other names in common use include 2-hydroxybutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate 2-oxoglutarate-lyase, (CoA-acetylating), acetyl-coenzyme A:2-ketoglutarate C-acetyl transferase, and homocitrate synthetase. This enzyme participates in lysine biosynthesis and pyruvate metabolism.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the sizing {{materials}} {{that has been}} used, the cloth may be steeped in a dilute acid and then rinsed, or enzymes {{may be used to}} break down the sizing material. Enzymes are applied in the desizing process if starch is used as sizing materials. <b>Carboxymethyl</b> cellulose (CMC) and Poly vinyl alcohol (PVA) are often used as sizing materials.|$|E
5000|$|Motilin was {{discovered}} by J.C. Brown when he introduced alkaline solution into duodena of dogs, which caused strong gastric contractions. Brown et al. predicted that alkali could either release stimulus to activate motor activity or prevent the secretion of inhibitory hormone. They isolated a polypeptide as a by-product from purification of secretin on <b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulose. They named this polypeptide “Motilin.” ...|$|E
50|$|Binders {{promote the}} binding of pigment {{particles}} {{between themselves and}} the coating layer of the paper. Binders are spherical particles less than 1 µm in diameter. Common binders are styrene maleic anhydride copolymer or styrene-acrylate copolymer. The surface chemical composition is differentiated by the adsorption of acrylic acid or an anionic surfactant, {{both of which are}} used for stabilization of the dispersion in water. Co-binders, or thickeners, are generally water-soluble polymers that influence the paper's color viscosity, water retention, sizing, and gloss. Some common examples are <b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulose (CMC), cationic and anionic hydroxyethyl cellulose (EHEC), modified starch, and dextrin.Styrene butadiene latex, Styrene acrylic, dextrin, oxidized starch are used in coatings to bind the filler to the paper. Co-binders are natural products such as starch and CMC (<b>Carboxymethyl</b> cellulose), that are used along with the synthetic binders, like styrene acrylic or styrene butadiene. Co-binders are used to reduce the cost of the synthetic binder and improve the water retention and rheology of the coating.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of lyases, {{specifically}} the oxo-acid-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is citrate oxaloacetate-lyase (forming acetate from the pro-S <b>carboxymethyl</b> group of citrate). Other names in common use include citrase, citratase, citritase, citridesmolase, citrate aldolase, citric aldolase, citrate lyase, citrate oxaloacetate-lyase, and citrate oxaloacetate-lyase (pro-3S)-CH2COO-->acetate. This enzyme participates in citrate cycle and two-component system - general.|$|E
5000|$|Binders. Often gums and resins, e.g. gum arabic, red gum, guar gum, copal, <b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulose, nitrocellulose, rice starch, cornstarch, shellac, dextrin. Binders {{can also}} serve as fuels. Camphor {{can be used as}} a plasticizer. Binders are used in {{manufacture}} of compact compositions, e.g. pyrotechnic stars. Polymers like HTPB and PBAN are often used for rocket fuels. Other polymers used are e.g. polyethylene or polyvinyl chloride can be encountered as well.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{different}} kinds of cellulases are known, which differ structurally and mechanistically. Synonyms, derivatives, and specific enzymes associated with the name [...] "cellulase" [...] include endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase (beta-1,4-glucanase, beta-1,4-endoglucan hydrolase, endoglucanase D, 1,4-(1,3,1,4)-beta-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase), <b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulase (CMCase), avicelase, celludextrinase, cellulase A, cellulosin AP, alkali cellulase, cellulase A 3, 9.5 cellulase, and pancellase SS. Enzymes that cleave lignin have occasionally been called cellulases, but this old usage is deprecated; they are lignin-modifying enzymes.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, the {{lubrication}} {{and high}} viscosity of a grease are desired {{in situations where}} non-toxic, non-oil based materials are required. <b>Carboxymethyl</b> cellulose, or CMC, is one popular material {{used to create a}} water-based analog of greases. CMC serves to both thicken the solution and add a lubricating effect, and often silicone-based lubricants are added for additional lubrication. The most familiar example of this type of lubricant, used as a surgical and personal lubricant, is K-Y Jelly.|$|E
50|$|The gum is {{normally}} made {{up into a}} solution in hot water (typically 10-25 g/litre), and then added to the glaze solution after any ball milling in concentrations from 0.02% to 3% of gum arabic to the dry weight of the glaze. On firing, the gum burns out at a low temperature, leaving no residues in the glaze. More recently, particularly in commercial manufacturing, gum arabic is often replaced by more refined and consistent alternatives, such as <b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulose (CMC).|$|E
5000|$|Miscellaneous: Cellulose can be {{converted}} into cellophane, a thin transparent film. It is the base material for the celluloid that was used for photographic and movie films until the mid-1930s. Cellulose is used to make water-soluble adhesives and binders such as methyl cellulose and <b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulose which are used in wallpaper paste. Cellulose is further used to make hydrophilic and highly absorbent sponges. Cellulose is the raw material {{in the manufacture of}} nitrocellulose (cellulose nitrate) which is used in smokeless gunpowder.|$|E
50|$|A {{viscometer}} {{can be used}} {{to measure}} the decrease in viscosity of a solution containing a water-soluble cellulose derivative such as <b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulose upon incubation with a cellulase sample. The decrease in viscosity is directly proportional to the cellulase activity. While such assays are very sensitive and specific for endo-cellulase (exo-acting cellulase enzymes produce little or no change in viscosity), they are limited {{by the fact that it}} is hard to define activity in conventional enzyme units (micromoles of substrate hydrolyzed or product produced per minute).|$|E
5000|$|Many other {{ingredients}} are added {{depending on the}} specific application. Such additives modify the foaming properties of the product by either stabilizing or counteracting foam. Other ingredients increase or decrease the viscosity of the solution, or solubilize {{other ingredients}}. Corrosion inhibitors counteract damage to washing equipment. [...] "Dye transfer inhibitors" [...] prevent dyes from one article from colouring other items. [...] "Antiredeposition agents" [...] are used to prevent fine soil particles from reattaching to the product being cleaned. <b>Carboxymethyl</b> cellulose is used for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|Another alternative, {{polysaccharide}} SIs {{meet the}} requirements for environmentally friendly materials; they contain no Phosphorus or Nitrogen and are noted for their non-toxic, renewable, and biodegradable properties. <b>Carboxymethyl</b> inulin (CMI), which is isolated from the roots of Inula helenium {{has been used in}} oil exploration and its very low toxicity and crystal growth inhibition power has been reported for treating calcite scales. Examples of poorly biodegradable SIs such as the amino-phosphonate and acrylate-based SIs are being phased-out by stringent environmental regulations as demonstrated in the North sea by Norway zero discharge policy.|$|E
5000|$|Tear replacers are a {{mainstay}} of treatment, preferably containing methylcellulose or <b>carboxymethyl</b> cellulose. [...] Ciclosporin stimulates tear production and acts as a suppressant on the immune-mediated processes that cause the disease. Topical antibiotics and corticosteroids are sometimes used to treat secondary infections and inflammation. A surgery known as parotid duct transposition is used in some extreme cases where medical treatment has not helped. This redirects the duct from the parotid salivary gland to the eye. Saliva replaces the tears. Dogs suffering from cherry eye should have the condition corrected to help prevent this disease.|$|E
50|$|Another {{interesting}} {{development for}} AC {{was involved with}} antibody separation using another TRP-ligand combination. Anastase-Ravion et al. attached a dextran derivative to the classic PNIPAAm {{to result in a}} poly(NIPAAm)-DD, and used this stationary phase to separate polyclonal antibodies from subcutaneous rabbit serum. From the study, the dextran derivative of choice was <b>carboxymethyl</b> dextran benzylamide sulfonate/sulfate, and when bound to the TRP was labeled poly(NIPAAm)-CMDBS. The LCST for the poly(NIPAAm)-CMDBS was raised from 32 °C to 33 °C. To test the success of the affinity binding, the antibodies were eluted with glycine buffer (adjusted to pH 2.6 with HCl).|$|E
