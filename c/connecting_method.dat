Five standardized joining configurations of orthodontic wire in spring hard quality were used: round, cross, 3 mm length, 9 mm length and 7 mm to orthodontic band. The joints were made by five different methods: brazing, tungsten inert gas (TIG) and laser welding with and without filling material. For the original orthodontic wire and for each kind of joint configuration or <b>connecting</b> <b>method</b> 10 specimens were carefully produced, totalizing 240. The fracture strengths were measured with a universal testing machine (Zwick 005). Data were analyzed by ANOVA (p= 0. 05) and Bonferroni post hoc test (p= 0. 05). In all cases, brazing joints were ruptured on a low level of fracture strength (186 - 407 N). Significant differences between brazing and TIG or laser welding (p< 0. 05, Bonferroni post hoc test) were found in each joint configuration. The highest fracture strength means were observed for laser welding with filling material and 3 mm joint length (998 N). Using filling materials, there was a clear tendency to higher mean values of fracture strength in TIG and laser welding. However, statistically significant differences were found only in the 9 -mm long joints (p< 0. 05, Bonferroni post hoc test). In conclusion, the fracture strength of welded joints was positively influenced by the additional use of filling material.

A ball grid array(BGA) {{which is one of}} the surface mount technologies becomes popular. The ball grid array packaging is usually required to connect chip by wire bonding method and to connect printed circuit board(PCB) by solder <b>connecting</b> <b>method.</b> Usually copper pad was first plated by electroless Ni-P and followed by electroless Au to eliminating lead wiring. Ni Local corrosion is usually developed if immersion Au plating is applied on the electroless Ni-P, because the electroless Au plating is displacement reaction and normally porus thin film. To obtain high reliability, a thick gold plating on Ni-P film was necessary, however a insertion of electorless Pd layer between electroless Au plating and electroless Ni-P plating was proposed to avoid local corrosion. The insertion of electroless Pd layer suppressed deterioration of solderability by annealing and it was independent of types of electroless Ni deposit as the under layer. However, share strength of solder ball and wire bonding strength was affected by under layer Ni-P film. Since the palladium layer was diffused into solder ball by annealing, the connecting strength depended on interface between solder and Ni-P film. Moreover, a surface condition of Au was depended on the electroless Ni-P film type, a diffused Ni detection on Au was also depend on the type of electroless Ni-P film. By observation of Ni-P film structure, the high connecting strength was obtain by using lamellar structure Ni-P film and the Ni-P film with columnar structure showed inferior connecting strength to that with lamellar structure. Therefore, it is concluded that the structure of under layer Ni-P film is important to obtain high reliability even for insertion of Pd layer...|$|E

40|$|A {{prefabricated}} building was designed in 1965 by the Committee for Antarctic Buildings and built in 1966 at Syowa Station. This building is of box-frame structure, {{which can be}} easily assembled in short time for multi-purpose establishment in the Antarctic area, such as sleeping quarters, mess hut, laboratory, etc. Therefore, even expedition members without any experiences in such construction are able to put it together. With the said building, thickness of the panel and its weight are exceptionally much more {{than those of the}} standard type, since the building is expected to accommodate deep frozen food as a cold storage. Of course, there is no changes in basic design. The outline of this building for cold storage is as follows : [table] Each panel contains insulation material of 100 mm thick which is sandwiched by water-proof plywood. Exterior surface of the panel is covered with stainless steel sheet and in-terior is lined with vinyl resin coated steel sheet. This {{prefabricated building}} has the following features : 1. For the jointed part of each corner of the structure, the unique prefabricated Lshaped corner-wall is employed. Since it is manufactured under a standard size, other components of the establishment, such as roof, floor, and side-wall can also be standardized. Besides, such tightly fastened prefabricated corner completely eliminates the fundamental weakpoint that has been unavoidable so far withstanding shock and tortion. 2. As for the jointing method of two panels, a long sized bolt of 13 φ is tightly screwed across the both adjacent frames, thus the surface of the both frames being tightly put together each other. In this method, only the bolting at two points in a panel substitutes for the traditional <b>connecting</b> <b>method</b> that is less endurable against shock and tortion. 3.

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bridge decks have been {{increasingly}} used as a competitive alternative for wood, concrete and orthotropic steel decks, due to their various advantages: light-weight, good corrosion resistance, low maintenance cost and rapid installation for minimizing the traffic disturbing time. These advantages meet critical needs for rehabilitation and new construction of pedestrian and highway bridges. To be cost effective, FRP decks are usually supported by steel girders. For the connection between FRP decks and steel girders, adhesive bonding technique is usually considered as a preferable <b>connecting</b> <b>method,</b> which can reduce construction time, save weight by eliminating fasteners, allow more uniform load transfer, achieve better adaption to the brittle and anisotropic nature of FRP materials and provide higher joint efficiency. Despite the fact that FRP bridge decks and adhesive joints are already in service in many FRP-steel composite bridges, mechanical behaviour and long-term performance are still not clearly understood, which results in more conservative designs of the FRP-steel composite bridges. To compensate this lack, the overall aim of this project is to investigate mechanical behaviours (in terms of strength and stiffness) of adhesively-bonded joints between FRP bridge decks and steel girders, as well as durability of these adhesively-bonded joints. As to the first aspect, considering the distribution of traffic loads in the longitudinal and transverse directions of bridges, the adhesive-bonded joints have been experimentally studied under six loading conditions, including tensile loading, shear loading and four combining ratios of tensile and shear loading. A specific tensile-shear loading device was designed and then employed to offer six different angle loading conditions. Different surface pretreatment methods (acetone (AC), sand paper (SP) and sand blasting (SB)) were compared with regard to influences on the stiffness, load-bearing capacity, failure mode and interfacial bonding quality of adhesive joints. A Finite Element (FE) model was developed to simulate the stress distribution throughout the adhesive joints under different loading conditions, which proved that the failure of joints was induced by combination of both tensile and shear stress peaks. The edge zone (approximately 10 mm from {{the ends of the}} adhesive layer) was the most sensitive area to initiate the failure, where both the shear stress peak and the tensile stress singularity were located. Another critical aspect of this research is to characterize the durability of FRP-to-steel adhesively-bonded joints under both temperature and moisture effects. The influence of hydrothermal environmental aging on the mechanical behaviours of adhesive joints has been studied and compared with the un-aged adhesive joints. The shear-tensile failure criterions of hydrothermal aged and un-aged adhesive joints were addressed. To better understand the moisture effects, the moisture diffusion process in FRP composite materials was characterized. Subsequently, the hydrothermal degradation on the flexural and interlaminar properties of FRP laminates was addressed. A coupled hygro-mechanical FE model was developed to analyse the enviroment-dependent mechanical behaviours of FRP lanimates. This FE model was first validated by test results of flexural tests and subsequently employed in an inverse parameter identification method to determine the elastic interlaminar shear modulus of FRP laminates. Predictive equations for environment-dependent mechanical properties (flexural and interlaminar) of FRP laminates were sustained by using the least square method for the curve fitting. Results of this research can {{contribute to the development of}} a design code of FRP-steel composite bridges. They can also be used as a reference information for understanding mechanical behaviours and durability of FRP-to-steel adhesively bonded joints for other applications in civil engineering field, such as strengthening of steel structures using FRP composite materials.
