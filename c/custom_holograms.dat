5000|$|The TTC {{redesigned}} its Metropasses {{to include}} <b>custom</b> <b>holograms</b> {{and a yellow}} [...] "activation" [...] sticker, beginning with the July 2009 Metropasses, due to widespread counterfeiting of the Metropasses between January and May 2009. In addition, removing the [...] "activation" [...] sticker reveals a thin film, {{which is used to}} prevent the reapplication of the sticker, and removing the film would leave a sticky residue, in which dirt and other particles can obscure the hologram. The thin film reads, [...] "Do not remove," [...] to prevent curious Metropass users from removing it.|$|E
50|$|Holographic Studios, {{located in}} the borough of Manhattan in New York City, is the world's oldest gallery of holography. It was founded in 1979 by Jason Sapan, {{one of the pioneers}} of holography. The {{storefront}} level gallery features the world's largest collection of motion image integral holograms. On display in the gallery are a variety of different types of holographic images, including a collection of celebrity hologram portraits. There are also cylindrical 360Â° floating images, multiple image holograms that change as you walk by, and computer generated holograms as well as a selection of novelty hologram items and stickers. Directly below the gallery is the laser laboratory where holograms are created. Holographic Studios creates <b>custom</b> <b>holograms,</b> holographic portraits, offers classes, and operates tours.|$|E

40|$|For many {{aspheric}} and freeform optical components, existing interferometric solutions {{require a}} <b>custom</b> computer-generated <b>hologram</b> (CGH) {{to characterize the}} part. The overall objective {{of this research is}} to develop hardware and a procedure to produce a combined, dynamic, Hartmann/ Digital Holographic interferometry inspection system {{for a wide range of}} advanced optical components, including aspheric and freeform optics. This new instrument would have greater versatility and dynamic range than currently available measurement systems. The method uses a spatial light modulator to pre-condition wavefronts for imaging, interferometry, and data processing to improve the resolution and versatility of an optical inspection instrument. Existing interferometers and Hartmann inspection systems have either too small a dynamic range or insufficient resolution to characterize conveniently unusual optical surfaces like aspherical and freeform optics. For interferometers, a specially produced, computer-generated holographic optical element is needed to transform the wavefront to within the range of the interferometer. A new hybrid wavefront sensor employs newly available spatial light modulators (SLMs) as programmable holographic optical elements (HOEs). The HOE is programmed to enable the same instrument to inspect an optical element in stages, first by a Hartmann measurement, which has a very large dynamic range but less resolution. The first measurement provides the information required to precondition a reference wave that avails the measurement process to the more precise phase shifting interferometry. The SLM preconditions a wavefront before it is used to inspect an optical component. This adds important features to an optical inspection system, enabling not just wavefront conditioning for null testing and dynamic range extension, but also the creation of hybrid measurement procedures. This, for example, allows the combination of dynamic digital holography and Hartmann sensing procedures to cover a virtually unlimited dynamic range with high resolution. Digital holography technology brings all of the power and benefits of digital holographic interferometry to the requirement, while Hartmann-type wavefront sensors bring deflectometry technologies to the solution. The SLM can be used to generate arbitrary wavefronts in one leg of the interferometer, thereby greatly simplifying its use and extending its range. The SLM can also be used to modify the system into a dynamic Shack-Hartmann system, which is useful for optical components with large amounts of slope. By integrating these capabilities into a single instrument, the system will have tremendous flexibility to measure a variety of optical shapes accurately...|$|R
40|$|The Infrared Multi-Object Spectrometer (IRMOS) is a facility-class {{instrument}} for the Kitt Peak National Observatory 4 and 2. 1 meter telescopes. IRMOS is a near-IR (0. 8 - 2. 5 micron) spectrometer and operates at approximately 80 K. The 6061 -T 651 aluminum bench and mirrors constitute an athermal design. The instrument produces simultaneous spectra at low- to mid-resolving power (R=lambda/delta lambda= 300 - 3000) of approximately 100 objects in its 2. 8 x 2. 0 arcmin field. We describe ambient and cryogenic optical {{testing of the}} IRMOS mirrors across a broad range in spatial frequency (figure error, mid-frequency error, and microroughness). The mirrors include three rotationally symmetric, off-axis conic sections, one off-axis biconic, and several flat fold mirrors. The symmetric mirrors include convex and concave prolate and oblate ellipsoids. They range in aperture from 94 x 86 mm to 286 x 269 mm and in f-number from 0. 9 to 2. 4. The biconic mirror is concave and has a 94 x 76 mm aperture, R(sub x) = 377 mm, k(sub x) = 0. 0778, R(sub y) = 407 mm, and k(sub y) = 0. 1265 and is decentered by - 2 mm in X and 227 mm in Y. All of the mirrors have an aspect ratio of approximately 6 : 1. The surface error fabrication tolerances are less than 10 nm RMS microroughness, 'best effort' for mid-frequency error, and less than 63. 3 nm RMS figure error. Ambient temperature (approximately 293 K) testing is performed {{for each of the}} three surface error regimes, and figure testing is also performed at approximately 80 K. Operation of the ADE Phaseshift MicroXAM white light interferometer (micro-roughness) and the Bauer Model 200 profilometer (mid-frequency error) is described. Both the sag and conic values of the aspheric mirrors make these tests challenging. Figure testing is performed using a Zygo GPI interferometer, <b>custom</b> computer generated <b>holograms</b> (CGH), and optomechanical alignment fiducials. Cryogenic CGH null testing is discussed in detail. We discuss complications such as the change in prescription with temperature and thermal gradients. Correction for the effect of the dewar window is also covered. We discuss the error budget for the optical test and alignment procedure. Data reduction is accomplished using commercial optical design and data analysis software packages. Results from CGH testing at cryogenic temperatures are encouraging thus far...|$|R
