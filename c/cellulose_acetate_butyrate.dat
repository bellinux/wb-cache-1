5000|$|<b>Cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> is {{also known}} as [...] "safety" [...] film and started to replace nitrate film in the 1920s.

Results of differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared measurements indicated that the pairing of CP/P(VP-co-VAc) formed a miscible or immiscible blend system according to the balance in effectiveness of the following factors: (1) hydrogen bonding between residual hydroxyls of CP and VP carbonyls of P(VP-co-VAc); (2) steric hindrance of propionyl side-groups to the interaction specified in (1); (3) intramolecular repulsion between the two units constituting the vinyl copolymer; and, additionally, (4) structural affinity between two segmental moieties involving the propionyl group and VAc unit, respectively. The factor 3 inducing intercomponent attraction is responsible for the appearance of a so-called "miscibility window" in the miscibility map, and the factor 4 substantially expands the miscible region whole, wider relative to those in the maps for the corresponding blend series based on <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> and <b>butyrate.</b> In further refined estimation by dynamic mechanical analysis and T_[1 ρ]^H quantification in solid-state [13]C NMR, it was found that the miscible blends of hydrogen-bonding type (using CPs of DS 2. 7) formed blends exhibiting a somewhat larger size of heterogeneity (ca. 5 – 20 nm) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractKitchen waste {{recovery}} in Taiwan has achieved 1 / 3 population equivalent and {{the characteristics of}} kitchen waste contained high organic substance make it a promising substrate for biohydrogenation. However, the hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass is the rate-limiting step in biohydrogenation process. As a result, the enrichment of cellulolytic consortia and bioaugmentation are crucial to improve biohydrogenation performance. In this study, enrichment strategy and bioaugmentation were adopted in a 3 -L biohydrogen and a 10 -L biomethane reactor fed with vegetable kitchen waste and napiergrass. The volumetric loading rate was controlled at 20 and 4 kg-COD m - 3 d - 1 with hydraulic retention time of 4 and 20 day respectively. Influent composition of napiergrass and vegetable kitchen waste was increased from 1 : 1 to 3 : 1 to enhance the cellulolytic characteristics in enrichment phase.
