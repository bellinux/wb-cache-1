500|$|Many other {{scenes in}} Homicide were filmed {{primarily}} in the Fells Point neighorhood, including actual streets, bars and houses to create authenticity. Scenes at the Homicide morgue were filmed inside Baltimore's actual Office of the Medical Examiner, which the actors hated performing in due to the unsettling atmosphere; Ned Beatty said of filming there, [...] "The one thing you can't get on camera is, oh boy, it smells." [...] Homicide footage was transferred from film to videotape for editing at the Maryland studio Colorlab Motion Picture Services. There, Levinson and Ewing worked with colorist Drexel Williams to drain the footage of <b>color</b> <b>value,</b> leaving a gritty visual style almost reminiscent of black-and-white. This technique was downplayed starting in the second season, giving the show a more colorful look.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the visual}} changes during Homicides second season were {{brighter}} colors. While colorist Drexel Williams previously drained footage of <b>color</b> <b>value</b> {{to create a}} gritty style, cinematographer Jean de Segonzac directed Williams to make the colors less muted and more lively. Segonzac also sought a more restrained visual style, as he believed the previous cinematographer Wayne Ewing tended to [...] "get a little too wild, and someone could complain they got a little dizzy". Levinson praised {{what he described as}} a subtler and more effective style under Segonzac. [...] "Bop Gun" [...] was originally meant to serve as the second season finale, but NBC decided to make it the season premiere with the hopes of getting increased ratings from Williams' guest appearance. The scenes with Williams were filmed over three days; Fontana said of the shooting, [...] " [...] worked like a dog. It was quite a special event for all of us. It's very intense." ...|$|E

Results were compared with those obtained for sesame roasted by the conventional method. The color of sesame seeds changes gradually during microwave processing. L <b>color</b> <b>values</b> decreased for all power levels with increasing exposure time, a and b <b>values</b> increased. L <b>color</b> <b>values</b> of tehina obtained from microwaved seeds at different power levels and exposure times and seeds depths were between 40. 78 - 61. 37. Similarly, a <b>color</b> <b>values</b> were between 1. 00 - 12. 31 and b <b>color</b> <b>values</b> between 16. 41 and 24. 86. Results showed that microwave oven roasting markedly reduced the roasting time in tehina production with respect to conventional method...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMost of the {{existing}} stereo matching algorithms will assume a similar corresponding <b>color</b> <b>values</b> between stereo images. In the real scenario, these <b>color</b> <b>values</b> are effected by several radiometric factors such as illumination direction, illumination color, camera parameters, etc, which results in different <b>color</b> <b>values</b> between the corresponding points. Hence, applying the stereo algorithm directly on the raw <b>color</b> <b>values</b> is not appropriate for the real-time environment. This paper proposes an entropy minimization based log chromaticity projection for stereo image, thereby extracting the invariant image, which is independent of illumination and color. The developed invariant image is the perfect measure for ﬁnding the similarity between the corresponding points. Normalized cross correlation based similarity measure is applied on the generated invariant image and the obtained disparity outperforms {{some of the local}} and global stereo algorithms...|$|R
50|$|A related {{capability}} is the posterization artistic effect, which also reduces {{the number of}} colors represented in an image. The difference between this and standard color quantization is that while in standard quantization the final palette is selected based upon a weighting of the prominence of existing colors in the image, posterization creates a palette of colors smoothly distributed across the spectrum represented in the image. Whereas with standard color quantization all of the final <b>color</b> <b>values</b> are ones {{that were in the}} original image, the <b>color</b> <b>values</b> in a posterized image may not have been present in the original image but are in between the original <b>color</b> <b>values.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{system of}} {{attraction}} and repulsion between quarks charged with {{different combinations of}} the three colors is called strong interaction, which is mediated by force carrying particles known as gluons; this is discussed at length below. The theory that describes strong interactions is called quantum chromodynamics (QCD). A quark, which will have a single <b>color</b> <b>value,</b> can form a bound system with an antiquark carrying the corresponding anticolor. The result of two attracting quarks will be color neutrality: a quark with color charge ξ plus an antiquark with color charge −ξ {{will result in a}} color charge of 0 (or [...] "white" [...] color) and the formation of a meson. This is analogous to the additive color model in basic optics. Similarly, the combination of three quarks, each with different color charges, or three antiquarks, each with anticolor charges, will result in the same [...] "white" [...] color charge and the formation of a baryon or antibaryon.|$|E
