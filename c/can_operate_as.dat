5|$|The Great Western Main Line from London to Bristol is in {{the process}} of being electrified. However because of cost overruns and delays, on 8 November 2016 the {{government}} announced that several elements of the programme would be deferred including electrification south west of Thingley Junction near Chippenham and Bristol Parkway. This will leave Temple Meads un-electrified but the new Hitachi Super Express trains are bi-mode so <b>can</b> <b>operate</b> <b>as</b> diesels around Bristol and can use electricity where the electrification work is complete. The electrification plans do not extend west of Bristol so local services will continue to be provided using diesel trains, with Class 165/166s cascaded from Thames Valley services scheduled to replace the 150/153/158s on local services.|$|E
25|$|Modern insurgencies {{and other}} types of warfare may include guerrilla warfare as part of an {{integrated}} process, complete with sophisticated doctrine, organization, specialist skills and propaganda capabilities. Guerrillas <b>can</b> <b>operate</b> <b>as</b> small, scattered bands of raiders, but they can also work side by side with regular forces, or combine for far ranging mobile operations in squad, platoon or battalion sizes, or even form conventional units. Based on their level of sophistication and organization, they can shift between all these modes as the situation demands. Successful guerrilla warfare is flexible, not static.|$|E
25|$|Crystals: Described {{as smooth}} spheres of glass, {{crystals}} are imbued with spells which {{allow them to}} be used for communication, and thus take the place of radios in the world. If operated away from a power point or ley line, they require regular recharging by some other means, which in one instance in the series involves the sacrifice of captive humans for their life energy which is used to power the crystal. Crystals <b>can</b> <b>operate</b> <b>as</b> videophones, showing an image of the person at the other end, as well as in audio-only mode. The emanations by which speech and images are transmitted between them are subject to interception by other mages, something {{at the forefront of the}} minds of most military planners in the series.|$|E

25|$|In {{times of}} war, the Coast Guard or {{individual}} components of it <b>can</b> <b>operate</b> <b>as</b> a {{service of the}} Department of the Navy. This arrangement has a broad historical basis, as the Coast Guard {{has been involved in}} wars as diverse as the War of 1812, the Mexican–American War, and the American Civil War, in which the cutter Harriet Lane fired the first naval shots attempting to relieve besieged Fort Sumter. The last time the Coast Guard operated as a whole within the Navy was in World War II. More often, military and combat units within the Coast Guard will operate under Navy or joint operational control while other Coast Guard units will remain under the Department of Homeland Security.|$|E
25|$|On 7 August, Ken McGonigle, aged 50, {{a former}} member of the RUC, saved the life of one of the most senior US {{officers}} in Afghanistan when he was killed. He was working in Musa Qal’eh, Helmand province with private security company New Century, when he exchanged fire with two escaped Taliban prisoners who were taking aim with a grenade launcher at a US special forces helicopter leaving a base. The 50-year-old Co Londonderry father of four was shot dead and two US Marines were subsequently killed in the fight. But the MV-22B Osprey aircraft, which <b>can</b> <b>operate</b> <b>as</b> both a helicopter and a turbo-prop aeroplane, escaped. It later emerged that vice admiral Robert Harward, a three-star US Navy SEAL who has been nominated to take over as deputy commander of US forces in Afghanistan, was in the aircraft. His actions later merited the award of the Queens Gallantry Medal.|$|E

Grimsby joint-manager Rob Scott noted Coulson's desire and work rate, saying [...] "that isn't always evident in wingers. He does {{both sides of the}} game". His ability to set up others has been praised, with Scott describing his assist tally for 2011–12 as [...] "excellent". While in the Scarborough youth team he played as an attacking midfielder.|$|E

2500|$|These special {{locomotives}} <b>can</b> <b>operate</b> <b>as</b> {{an electric}} locomotive or as a diesel locomotive. [...] The Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad and New Jersey Transit Rail Operations operate dual-mode diesel–electric/third-rail (catenary on NJTransit) locomotives between non-electrified territory and New York City {{because of a}} local law banning diesel-powered locomotives in Manhattan tunnels. [...] For the same reason, Amtrak operates a fleet of dual-mode locomotives in the New York area. [...] British Rail operated dual diesel–electric/electric locomotives designed to run primarily as electric locomotives with reduced power available when running on diesel power. [...] This allowed railway yards to remain un-electrified, as the third rail power system is extremely hazardous in a yard area.|$|E
2500|$|In {{explaining}} {{the potential of}} cultural projects in the public sphere, the artist writes: “I try {{to understand what is}} happening in the city, how the city <b>can</b> <b>operate</b> <b>as</b> a communicative environment… It is important to understand the circumstances under which communication is reduced or destroyed, and under what possible new conditions it can be provoked to reappear. How can aesthetic practice in the built environment contribute to critical discourse between the inhabitants themselves and the environment? How can aesthetic practice make existing symbolic structures respond to contemporary events?” For Wodiczko, disrupting the complacency of perception is imperative for passersby to stop, reflect, and perhaps even change their thinking; so he built his visual repertoire to evoke both the historical past and the political present.|$|E
2500|$|The Walker Linerlock, {{invented by}} knifemaker Michael Walker, and the framelock came to {{prominence}} in the 1980s. [...] In both designs the liner inside the knife is spring-loaded to engage {{the rear of the}} blade when open and thus hold it in place. [...] In the case of the framelock, the liner is the handle, itself. The Swiss Army knife product range has adopted dual linerlocks on their 111mm models. Some models feature additional [...] "positive" [...] locks, which essentially ensure that the blade cannot close accidentally. CRKT has patented an [...] "Auto-LAWKS" [...] device, which features a second sliding switch on the hilt. It <b>can</b> <b>operate</b> <b>as</b> any linerlock knife if so desired, but if the user slides the second control up after opening, it places a wedge between the linerlock and the frame, preventing the lock from disengaging until the second device is disabled.|$|E

2500|$|In 1961, {{when the}} Niagara Falls {{hydroelectric}} project went online, {{it was the}} largest hydropower facility in the Western world. Today, Niagara is still the largest electricity producer in New York state, with a generating capacity of 2.4 gigawatts (million kilowatts). Up to [...] of water a second is diverted from the Niagara River through conduits under the city of Niagara Falls to the Lewiston and Robert Moses power plants. Currently between 50% and 75% of the Niagara River's flow is diverted via four huge tunnels that arise far upstream from the waterfalls. The water then passes through hydroelectric turbines that supply power to nearby areas of Canada and the United States before returning to the river well past the falls. This water spins turbines that power generators, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. When electricity demand is low, the Lewiston units <b>can</b> <b>operate</b> <b>as</b> pumps to transport water from the lower bay back up to the plant's reservoir, allowing this water to be used again during the daytime when electricity use peaks. During peak electrical demand, the same Lewiston pumps are reversed and actually become generators, similar to those at the Moses plant.|$|E
