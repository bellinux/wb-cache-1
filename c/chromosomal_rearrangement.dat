5|$|In 2016, {{two studies}} further pinpointed the {{responsible}} region to chromosome 11 and a 4.5-Mb covering <b>chromosomal</b> <b>rearrangement.</b> The scientists {{were able to}} show that the first genetic change happened 3.8 million years ago on the resident chromosome, when a part of it broke off and was reintroduced in the wrong direction. This inversion created the faeder allele. About 500,000 years ago another rare recombination event of faeder and resident allele in the very same inverted region lead to the satellite allele. The 4.5 Mb inversion covers 90 genes, {{one of them is the}} centromere coding gene N- CENPN-, which is located exactly at one of the inversion breakpoints. The inactivation of the gene has severe deleterious effects and pedigree data of a captive ruff colony suggests that the inversion is homozygous lethal. Over the course of the past 3.8 million years, further mutations have accumulated within the inversion i.e. three deletions ranging from 3.3 to 17.6 kb. Two of these deletions remove evolutionary highly conserved elements close to two genes- HSD17B2 and SDR42E1-both holding important roles in metabolism of steroid hormones. Hormone measurements around mating time showed that whereas residents have a sharp increase of testosterone, faeders and satellites only experience higher androstenedione levels, a substance which is considered an intermediate in testosterone biosynthesis. The authors conclude that one or more of the deletions act as a cis-acting regulatory mutation which is altering the expression of one or both genes and eventually contributes to the different male phenotypes and behaviour.|$|E
2500|$|A membrane-associated {{variant of}} cytosolic Hsp90, lacking an ATP-binding site, has {{recently}} been identified and was named Hsp90N. [...] This HSP90α-Δ-N transcript is a chimera, with the first 105 bp of the coding sequence derived from the CD47 gene on chromosome 3q13.2, and the remaining coding sequence derived from HSP90AA1. However, [...] gene-encoding Hsp90N was later proven to be non-existent in human genome.

2500|$|The {{difficulty}} {{expressed in}} placing the {{species in the}} proper family {{is due to the}} unique floral morphology. How this inverted position of the androecium and gynoecium evolved is unknown, but some studies have posed hypotheses. Davidse and Martínez suggested that L. schismatica could be one of Richard Goldschmidt's [...] "hopeful monsters", meaning that the inverted floral morphology could have arisen from a macromutation in the genes that control floral development. It is also possible that chromosomal repatterning, also known as <b>chromosomal</b> <b>rearrangement,</b> was the origin of this species.|$|E

Such outcomes can result from both the repair and misrepair of DNA ends, which arise from a variety of lesions including DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), collapsed replication forks and dysfunctional telomeres. Here we review the mechanisms by which non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) repair pathways can both promote <b>chromosomal</b> <b>rearrangements</b> and also suppress them in response to such lesions, in accordance with their increasingly recognised tumour suppressor function. Further, we consider how <b>chromosomal</b> <b>rearrangements,</b> together with a modular approach towards understanding their etiology, may be exploited for cancer therapy...|$|R
2500|$|Controversy {{about the}} 2R {{hypothesis}} hinged {{on the nature}} of paralogy regions. It is not disputed that human chromosomes bear sets of genes related to sets of genes on other chromosomes; the controversy centres on whether they were generated by large-scale duplications that doubled all the genes at the same time, or whether a series of individual gene duplications occurred followed by <b>chromosomal</b> <b>rearrangement</b> to shuffle sets of genes together. Hughes and colleagues found that phylogenetic trees built from different gene families within paralogy regions had different shapes, suggesting that the gene families had different evolutionary histories. This was suggested to be inconsistent with the 2R hypothesis. However, other researchers have argued that such 'topology tests' do not test 2R rigorously, because recombination could have occurred between the closely related chromosomes generated by polyploidy, because inappropriate genes had been compared and because different predictions are made if genome duplication occurred through hybridisation between species. In addition, several researchers were able to date duplications of gene families within paralogy regions consistently to the early evolution of vertebrates, after divergence from amphioxus, consistent with the 2R hypothesis. When complete genome sequences became available for vertebrates, Ciona intestinalis and amphioxus, it was found that much of the human genome was arranged in paralogy regions that could be traced to large-scale duplications, and that these duplications occurred after vertebrates had diverged from tunicates [...] and amphioxus.|$|E

The central aim of my work is {{to test this hypothesis}} using Drosophila americana as a model system.

Five intraspecific chromosomal hybrid zones characterized by different levels of karyotypic complexity were studied using 16 microsatellites markers. We observed low levels of genetic differentiation even in the hybrid zones with the highest karyotypic complexity.

50|$|It may be {{a random}} event during the {{formation}} of reproductive cells or in early fetal development or due familial <b>chromosomal</b> <b>rearrangement</b> called chromosomal translocation. In less than 20%, inheritance is through an autosomal dominant pattern. The parent is usually unaffected, but carries a <b>chromosomal</b> <b>rearrangement</b> called a balanced translocation, in which no genetic material is gained or lost. Increased rate of unexplained fetal loss may be observed in MDS carriers with balanced translocations although they may be otherwise asymptomatic. However, they can become also unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. Miller-Dieker syndrome is usually not inherited. The deletion event occurs randomly during gametogenesis (formation of eggs or sperm) or in early foetal development. Therefore, no history of the disorder is usually seen in their families.|$|E

Four chromosomes carrying non-reciprocal translocations apparently arose from the duplication of two chromosomes, and three chromosomes apparently arose from end-to-end or end-to-opposite-end fusions of chromosomes or chromosome segments.

50|$|In {{terms of}} the {{structural}} architecture of copy number variations, research has suggested and defined hotspot regions in the genome where copy number variations are four times more enriched. These hotspot regions were defined to be regions containing long repeats that are 90-100% similar known as segmental duplications either tandem or interspersed and most importantly, these hotspot regions have an increased rate of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>rearrangement.</b> It was thought that these large-scale chromosomal rearrangements give rise to normal variation and genetic diseases, including copy number variations. Moreover, these copy number variation hotspots are consistent throughout many populations from different continents, implying that these hotspots were either independently acquired by all the populations and passed on through generations, or they were acquired in early human evolution before the populations split, the latter seems more likely. Lastly, spatial biases of the location at which copy number variations are most densely distributed {{does not seem to}} occur in the genome. Although it was originally detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization and microsatellite analysis that copy number repeats are localized to regions that are highly repetitive such as telomeres, centromeres, and heterochromatin, recent genome-wide studies have concluded otherwise. Namely, the subtelomeric regions and pericentromeric regions are where most <b>chromosomal</b> <b>rearrangement</b> hotspots are found, and there is no considerable increase in copy number variations in that region. Furthermore, these regions of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>rearrangement</b> hotspots do not have decreased gene numbers, again, implying that there is minimal spatial bias of the genomic location of copy number variations.|$|E
