The time series of total thickness from 24 August to 7 September 2003 indicates that deformed and second-/multi-year ice floes appear frequently in very <b>close</b> <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> farther from the ice edge, while thinner ice floes less than 1 m are frequently found in open pack ice. The probability density function of total thickness shows that a major peak appears at around 1. 5 m thickness in very <b>close</b> <b>pack</b> <b>ice,</b> presumably corresponding to second-year or deformed ice.

40|$|Operation of manned {{oil and gas}} {{installations}} in arctic locations is complicated and presents new challenges. One of the challenges is to maintain {{the safety of the}} crew, by obtaining adequate lifeboat systems for crew evacuation. This master thesis focuses on different methods for meeting this challenge. The weather and climate conditions in the Arctic are very different from the conditions we find in more southern oceans. Extreme temperatures, winds caused by polar lows, icing and sea ice presents new and difficult challenges which is demanding for the operation of lifeboats. Hazard identification analyses of two types are performed to identify potential hazards of operating existing lifeboats in arctic conditions. These identify the following hazards as the most critical: Freezing of moving davit components Risk of floating pieces of ice occurring in the launching zone for free fall lifeboats <b>Close</b> <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> present at the time of evacuation Open drift ice or <b>close</b> <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> present during the initial operational phase Sea spray icing on the lifeboat at sea Open drift ice or <b>close</b> <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> present in the operational phase Based on the hazard identification analyses, a specification of requirements for arctic lifeboats is established. This specification is intended to supplement, and not replace, the existing regulations and requirements which apply to lifeboats. Based on the specification, alternatives for modification of existing lifeboats are suggested and discussed. The modification alternatives include modifications of launching equipment, hull strengthening and propulsion equipment. However, full compliance with the specification is not believed to be achievable by modifications. Three different concepts for arctic survival crafts are outlined, each intended for a specific set of ice conditions. Concept one is an arctic free fall lifeboat, intended to be launched by free fall in the icefree summer season, and launched by a more conventional method in the ice season. The lifeboat is designed to be able to operate in higher ice concentrations than existing lifeboats are capable of. Concept two is an arctic conventional lifeboat, intended to be launched {{in the same way as}} existing conventional lifeboats. It is designed to operate in very high ice concentrations, by use of Archimedes screws. Concept three is an arctic survival vehicle, designed to operate in continuous ice and very high ice concentrations. Propulsion is provided by twin pair of tracks. In the final part of the thesis, the Arctic Free Fall Lifeboat is developed further. Dimensions, capacities, hull design and features for arctic operation are described. An improved launching arrangement is also described, capable of operating in two different modes depending on the ice concentrations in the area. The thesis concludes that existing lifeboats can be modified to achieve better performance and safety in arctic conditions, but the potential for improvement is limited. To achieve high performance and a high level of safety, arctic lifeboats must be designed and built for this purpose. </p...|$|E
40|$|Forty {{members of}} the 13 th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition left Tokyo on November 25 th, 1971, aboard the {{icebreaker}} FUJI, {{under the command of}} Captain MAEDA. The expedition team was led by the author who also led the summer party of 10 members. Mr. KAWAGUCHI, deputy leader, also led the wintering party of 30 members at Syowa. The FUJI, equipped with two Sikorsky S- 61 A helicopters and one Bell 47 G 2 A helicopter for polar operations, carried nearly 500 tons of cargo for the wintering party. Since the dry after the departure, scientific researches on board, comprising oceanography, biology, meteorology, gravity survey, radio wave propergation and cosmic ray, were performed according to the schedule. On December 16 th, 1971, the FUJI left Fremantle and reached the ice edge on January 1 st, 1972, approximately 40 miles north from Syowa. Since January 5 th, the FUJI tried to break through the fast ice to approach Syowa, but her progress against the hard winter fast ice averaged only one mile a day. Fortunately, the weather condition was good enough for the flights of helicopters throughout the period, so the transportation of supplies for the station and scientific field studies was carried out efficiently. On February 20 th, the 13 th wintering party was organized {{to take the place of}} the 12 th wintering party at Syowa Station. On February 23 th, the FUJI at the location of 17 miles west-northwest of Syowa, directed her couise northward and started for home. However, on March 13 th when she reached the edge of ice she met with <b>closed</b> <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> (consolidated <b>pack</b> <b>ice)</b> as wide as 6 miles, and was forced to stay there.

40|$|Between December 1996 and February 1997, weaned pups and postmoult female {{elephant}} seals (Mirounga leonina) were {{fitted with}} satellite transmitters at King George Island (South Shetlands). Of the nine adult females tracked {{for more than}} two months, three stayed in a localized area between the South Shetlands and the South Orkneys. The other six females travelled southwest along the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula up to the Bellingshausen Sea. Two of them then moved far northeast and hauled out on South Georgia in October. One female was last located north of the South Shetlands in March 1998. In total, eight females were again sighted on King George Island and six of the transmitters removed. The tracks of the weaners contrasted with those of the adults. In January, five juveniles left King George Island for the Pacific sector ranging about four weeks in the open sea west of the De Gerlache Seamounts. Three of them returned to the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula in June, of which one was last located on the Patagonian Shelf in November 1997. The juveniles avoided sea ice while the adults did not. The latter displayed behavioural differences in using the <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> habitat during winter.

In total, 1, 620 transect counts were realised, lasting 30 [*]min each. The five most numerous seabird species represented 74 % of the total of 15, 150 individuals registered: kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, fulmar Fulmarus glacialis, puffin Fratercula arctica, Ross’s gull Rhodostethia rosea, and little auk Alle alle. Eight cetacean species were tallied {{for a total of}} 330 individuals, mainly white-beaked dolphin Lagenorhynchus albirostris and fin whale Balaenoptera physalus. Five pinniped species were represented by a total of 55 individuals and the polar bear Ursus maritimus was represented by 12 individuals. Four main geographical zones were identified: from Tromsø to the outer marginal ice zone (OMIZ), the Arctic pack ice (<b>close</b> <b>pack</b> <b>ice,</b> CPI), the end of Lomonosov Ridge off Siberia, and the route off Siberia and northern Norway. Important differences were detected between zones, both in species composition and in individual abundance.

Visual ice observations aboard the ship were carried out every four hours, excluding the period from January 5 to February 11, 1975. An ice chart was compiled from shipboard observations supplemented with helicopter observations. Offshore regions of the Prince Olav Coast and Lutzow-Holm Bay were covered with very <b>close</b> <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> in which medium or small floes were predominant.

40|$|ABSTRACTLarge (> 64 µm) protozooplankton (radiolarians, thecate dinoflagellates, foraminiferans, and tintinnid ciliates) and copepod nauplii were sampled at six {{stations}} {{located in}} sea ice covered waters, using a multinet at five depth intervals between {{the surface and}} 1000 m during a late winter expedition of RV 'Polarstern' on a west-east transect across the Weddell Sea. Large (> 400 µm) phaeodarian radiolarians contributed more than 98 % of the carbon in the large protozooplankton fraction; large protozoo-plankton were approximately 38 % of the total protozooplankton carbon during the late winter under the <b>close</b> <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> in the upper 250 m. Large protozooplankton may therefore be an important food source for small particle-feeding zooplankton in the upper 250 m, and a modest food source down to 1000 m. Phaeodarian species distributions showed a distinct vertical pattern. Except for spumellarian and nassellarian radiolarians all other protozooplankton (foraminiferans, thecate dinoflagellates, tintinnids) were most abundant in the upper 250 m. The horizontal variation showed a western, central and eastern pattern most {{probably due to the}} differing regional hydrography. Feeding ecology of the dominant species of phaeodarians was examined using transmission electron microscopy of contents of feeding vacuoles. The 58 specimens were trophic generalists. The predominance of silica fragments and amorphous material in vacuoles and the similarity of vacuole contents of specimens from 3 depth zones suggest that phaeodarians in late winter may have fed on organic aggregates...|$|E
40|$|The first aim of our {{long-term}} {{study on the}} at-sea distribution of the upper trophic levels—seabirds and marine mammals—in polar marine ecosystems is to identify the main factors affecting their distribution: water masses and <b>pack</b> <b>ice,</b> fronts and ice edge as defined {{on the basis of}} water temperature, salinity and ice overage. In this study, seabird at-sea distribution was determined in the south-eastern Atlantic Ocean in summer along four return transects between Cape Town, South Africa, and Queen Maud Land, Antarctica: two on board icebreaking MS Ivan Papanin and two on board icebreaking RV Polarstern between December 2007 and January 2012. During a total of 1, 930 half-an-hour transect counts devoted to seabird recording, 69, 000 individuals were encountered, belonging to 57 species (mean: 36 individuals per count, all species and expeditions pooled). In comparison, the adjacent Weddell Sea shows a lower seabird biodiversity (30  species and  150 individuals per count) than in the area covered by this study. European Arctic seas reflect an intermediate biodiversity, with 30 species and 60 individuals per count; the major difference is observed in <b>closed</b> <b>pack</b> <b>ice,</b> almost empty in the Arctic but showing a very high biomass in the Antarctic.

40|$|Daily {{rates of}} gross and net primary {{production}} were calculated in the Scotia-Weddell Sea sector of the Southern Ocean during spring 1988 (EPOS, Leg 2) {{on the basis of}} kinetic experiments, which combine radiotracer technology and classic biochemical procedures, and by taking into account the light regime, the physical structure of the water column, the vertical distribution of chlorophyll a, and the protozoan grazing pressure. From these calculations, three distinct sub-areas were identified: the <b>Closed</b> <b>Pack</b> <b>Ice</b> Zone (CPIZ), characterized by the lowest average gross primary production (0. 36 gC · m– 2 · day– 1); the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) with a maximum mean value of 1. 76 gC · m– 2 · day– 1; and the Open Ocean Zone off the ice edge (OOZ) with an intermediate mean value of 0. 87 gC · m– 2 · day– 1. Net primary production fluctuated nearly in the same proportions, averaging 0. 55, 0. 2 and 1. 13 gC · m– 2 · day– 1 in the OOZ, CPIZ and MIZ respectively, representing 53 % of the total photo-assimilated carbon under heavy ice cover (CPIZ) and 64 % in the two other areas. Available light, strongly dependent on the ice cover, was shown to control the level of primary production in the sea ice associated sub-areas, whilst protozoa grazing on phytoplankton determined the moderate primary production level characteristic of the ldquowell illuminatedrdquo OOZ area.

40|$|The {{early spring}} {{distribution}} of seabirds, pinnipeds and cetaceans was quantitatively determined {{in the northern}} Weddell Sea during the EPOS 1 cruise of the icebreaking RV Polarstern. Two hundred and ninety-one half hour counts {{were made in the}} Antarctic region between October 18 and November 16, 1988 (+ 94 counts in sub-antarctic and sub-tropical water). The bird populations were dominated by the Adélie Penguin Pygoscelis adeliae, which represented 90 % of the birds counted in the <b>closed</b> <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> (CPI), with a mean density of 31 penguins per km 2. Crabeater seal Lobodon carcinophagus, the most common pinniped, had a mean density of 1. 2 /km 2 in the CPI with local concentrations reaching 14 /km 2. Expressed as biomass, mean values of about 90 kg/km 2 were found in the whole Antarctic zone for seabirds, 50 for seals, and 35 for baleen cetaceans. Densities were higher in the CPI: 140, 180 and 115 kg/km 2 respectively, were found for birds, pinnipeds and baleen whales, and lowest in open water (8 kg/km 2 for the birds, 0. 2 for the pinnipeds and no whales). A minimum value of food intake by seabirds and marine mammals was estimated to be 2. 7 mg C/m 2 /day for the Antarctic zone (4. 1 in the CPI). Taking into account that pinnipeds density and cetacean food uptake are underestimated, and that Antarctic seabirds consume much more fish than generally suspected, a minimum krill production of 16 mg C/m 2 /day is proposed for the Antarctic zone: 22. 5 in the CPI, 3 in open water, and intermediate values in the marginal ice zones. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.

The FUJI carried 500 tons of cargo, including a single-engine monoplane Lockheed LASA- 60, and was equipped with two Sikorsky S 61 -A helicopters and one Bell 47 G 2 A helicopter. On December 16, the FUJI left Fremantle for Syowa Station and proceeded to pack ice off the coast of the Enderby Land. On January 10, 1971, one blade of starboard screw of Fuji was broken by very <b>close</b> <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> and she was beset at 67 ° 15. 72 ̆ 7 S, 44 ° 48. 52 ̆ 7 E (170 nautical miles northeast of Syowa Station) until February 10.

Three days after, LASA picked up the traverse party at F- 16 that is the terminal point of our continent traverses. Early in February, the ice condition began to loosen. On February 10, the ship freed herself from heavy pack ice and advanced westward. On that night she reached 44 miles north of Syowa Station.

40|$|During {{austral spring}} and summer 1988 the upper 500 m of water column in the Scotia-Weddell Confluence was sampled for the {{elemental}} composition of total suspended matter. For particulate organic carbon surface water concentrations ranged between 2. 5 and 15 -mu-mol/l, with an estimated 19 to 47 % of this pool being detrital carbon. In late November, the highest surface water particulate organic carbon concentrations (15 -mu-mol/l) occurred in the Confluence area where they coincided with a maximum in particulate Si (1. 7 -mu-mol/l). Later in the season particulate Si in the Confluence area decreased to less-than-or-equal-to 0. 3 -mu-mol/l. In the Scotia Sea on the contrary, surface water particulate Si increased with time and reached 3 -mu-mol/l in late December. For particulate Ca and Sr in surface water, strong gradients are observed across the Scotia Front (e. g. Ca: from 230 to 10 nmol/l; Sr: from 1. 0 to 0. 1 nmol/ 1), with highest concentrations in the Scotia Sea. In general, these distributions are confirmed by the observations on plankton species composition, done by other participants. In the Scotia Sea heavily calcified coccolithophorids and diatoms occurred throughout the season, while in the Confluence area heavily calcified coccolithophorids were absent and a switch-over from diatom to naked flagellate dominance was observed following a krill event. In the surface waters, the lithogenic Si fraction represents on average only 4 % of the total particulate Si content. However, this fraction reaches 60 % below 100 m depth in the Confluence area, due mainly {{to the presence of}} a sub-surface maximum in the aluminosilicate load (particulate Al content up to 30 nmol/l), probably reflecting advection of resuspended shelf sediments.

40|$|Three main {{aspects of}} the {{possible}} impacts of retreating <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> and changing ice coverage in the European Arctic on the higher trophic levels are discussed in this chapter: 1. Seabirds are depending on their colonies on land during the breeding season; the main species, e. g. little auk Alle alle, feed in mixed Polar/ Arctic Water {{in order to bring}} back food (polar zooplankton) to their chicks on the nest. In case ice coverage is very low, distance between colony and feeding grounds might become too long for such daily trips, and little auks might have to interrupt breeding and massively leave their colonies {{before the end of the}} reproduction cycle (e. g. on Jan Mayen in July 2005). On a longer term, if ice coverage was decreasing too much in future years, the whole Spitzbergen population might be affected, as well as other seabird species feeding mainly at the ice edge. 2. Stocks of large whales were close to depletion in the north-eastern Atlantic due to massive over-exploitation by whaling, and to their separation from the more abundant North Pacific stocks by high ice coverage of both the North-East and North-West Passages. In the frame of our long-term study of the at-sea distribution of seabirds and marine mammals in Arctic seas from 1979 on, resulting in more than 10, 000 half-an-hour transect counts, an important increase of the north-eastern Atlantic stocks was detected from 2007 on, the year with lowest ice coverage, mainly for bowhead Balaena mysticus, blue whale Balaenoptera musculus, humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae and fin whale Balaenoptera physalus. Such a sudden and important increase cannot be attributed to population growth, but to a probable inflow from the more abundant Pacific stocks, the decrease of ice coverage allowing the opening of the Passages. 3. On the other hand, polar bear Ursus maritimus and its prey: pinnipeds - mainly harp seal Pagophilus (Phoca) groenlandica - seem not to show any important decline of their population, with a few local exceptions. Moreover, encountered bears regularly concerned mother with cub(s), which also reflect the good health status of the population. The reason is probably that they are not bound to <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> as such, but to the Outer Marginal Ice Zone (OMIZ) : they are almost absent in the <b>Closed</b> <b>Pack</b> <b>Ice</b> (CPI). They seem to adapt and follow the OMIZ, even when its position is influenced by changes in ice coverage. These data collected on board icebreaking RV Polarstern are discussed in this chapter, in function of changes in ice coverage, in the extent of the main water masses and thus in the position of the ice edge and fronts...|$|R
40|$|The {{harp seal}} Phoca groenlandica {{is the most}} {{abundant}} seal species in the Barents Sea, {{and it may be}} a significant predator on other marine resources in this area. In order to evaluate the ecological role of harp seals, field studies, including both analysis of harp seal stomach contents and concurrent estimates of prey abundance, were carried out in the Barents Sea during August/September 1990. It appeared that, {{at this time of the}} year, the harp seals were confined to the northmost areas of this sea, either close to or within the <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> belt. Trawl surveys revealed that the most abundant food resources in sea surface layers in areas <b>close</b> to the <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> belt were the amphipod Parathemisto libellula and krill Thysanoessa spp. The fish fauna is poor, and occurs mainly near the bottom. Numerically, capelin Mallotus villosus and polar cod Boreogadus saida dominated, but also long rough dab Hippoglossoides platessoides, Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, snailfish Liparis fabricii and Atlantic poacher Leptagonus decagonus occured quite frequently.

40|$|A {{sophisticated}} {{physical model}} of the dry snow/firn densification process in ice sheets is proposed. Macroscopically, snow and firn undergo vertical uniaxial compression with non-zero deviatoric stresses and strain rates. The present mathematical description of densificntion includes dilatancy and "force-chain" effects in snow and develops previous concepts of ice-particle rearrangement by grain-boundary sliding and sintering by power-law creep under overburden pressure. Both densification mechanisms work together during the first snow stage until the <b>closest</b> <b>packing</b> of <b>ice</b> grains is reached at critical densities of 0. 7 - 0. 76 and the firn stage controlled only by the dislocation creep sets on. In addition to the ice-grain coordination number and {{the slope of the}} radial distribution function, a new structural parameter is introduced to account for grain bonding (agglomeration) effects. The model is constrained and validated on direct stereological observations of ice core structures and a representative set of snow/firn density-depth profiles covering a wide range of present-day climatic conditions (- 57. 5 to - 10 ℃ and ice accumulation at 2. 15 to 330 cm yr^[- 1]). Simple equations are derived for predicting the depth of pore closure in firn and the ice age at close-off.

The majority of the ice on the Great Lakes is <b>pack</b> <b>ice,</b> which is not attached to the shore. <b>Pack</b> <b>ice</b> is classified by size (ice field: collection of ice floes at least 8 km; ice floe: single piece of <b>pack</b> ice; <b>ice</b> cake: ic...|$|R

Antarctic krill, especially {{in the early stages of}} development, seem to need the <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> structures in order to have a fair chance of survival. The <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> provides natural cave-like features which the krill uses to evade their predators. In the years of low <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> conditions the krill tend to give way to salps, a barrel-shaped free-floating filter feeder that also grazes on plankton.|$|R

The polynya forms initially by the first year <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> being driven away from the coast, which leaves an area of open water within which new ice is formed. This new ice is then also herded downwind toward the first year <b>pack</b> <b>ice.</b> When it reaches the <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> the new ice is consolidated onto the <b>pack</b> <b>ice.</b> The latent heat polynya is the open water region between the coast and the <b>ice</b> <b>pack.</b>|$|R

It is necessary {{to understand how the}} transfer of heat from the lakes to the overlying atmosphere is influenced by different <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> concentrations and arrangements because this transfer directly affects the development and intensity of lake-effect snowstorms and extratropical cyclones. The Great Lakes Ice Cover – Atmospheric Flux (GLICAF) experiment was conducted in February 2004 to quantify the surface-atmosphere exchanges that occur over mid-latitude ice-covered lakes.

500|$|During {{the first}} half of each year the waters off Newfoundland may become covered with floes of sea ice or [...] "pack ice". While icebergs are {{composed}} of fresh water, <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> is frozen sea water. The severity of ice varies considerably, depending on the strength and direction of the wind and air temperature. Most of the <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> off Newfoundland's northern and eastern shores originates off Labrador. While some of the <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> off the west coast also comes from the sea off Labrador via the Strait of Belle Isle, most of it originates in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Beginning in January the <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> begins to advance south, borne by the Labrador Current until (usually) in April the rate of melting overtakes the rate of advance and the ice retreats northward. The leading edge of the <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> is known as [...] "The Front" [...] and is important to the annual seal hunt off Newfoundland's north coast.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{seasonal}} formation/melting process of <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> on the PCB level of sea water at Gerlache Inlet and Wood Bay (Ross Sea, Antarctica) was investigated during four Italian expeditions, i. e. ! 988 - 89, 1990 - 91, 1991 - 92 and 1993 - 94. Surface sea water samples from Gerlache Inlet and Wood Bay before <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> melting showed a typical total PCB concentration of 133 pg/l and 120 pg/l, respectively, which increased {{by a factor}} of about 1. 3 in both sampling sites during <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> melting. This effect was attributed to the transfer of PCBs contained in the <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> to sea water, and salinity was used as a tracer to verify this hypothesis. In this respect, <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> and sea water samples were collected during the 1993 - 94 Italian expedition, and both salinity (S) and PCB content were measured. A fairly good agreement was observed between the experimental PCB concentration and the value calculated by the dilution model which was applied to the mixing process between sea and <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> melting waters. Although this effect seems to be limited in time and space it is nevertheless significant because it happens during summer when biological species have their highest activity...|$|R

The algal groups haptophytes, dinoflagellates and diatoms were identified in surface, interior and bottom assemblages in the <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> cores using the photosynthetic marker pigments 19 '-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin (HEX), peridinin (PER) and fucoxanthin (FUC), respectively. DMSP concentrations were significantly correlated (P< 0. 01, Pearson) with chlorophyll-a (r= 0. 58), HEX (r= 0. 75), PER (r= 0. 79) and FUC (r= 0. 63) concentrations. The pool of DMSP within the <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> (mean 107 nM) was contributed mainly by interior and bottom algal assemblages (mean 94 and 268 nM, respectively), whilst the surface algal assemblages were minor contributors (mean 18 nM). DMSP production and/or accumulation appears to differ between surface, interior and bottom <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> algal assemblages {{due to differences in}} biomass, class composition, and possibly the unique environmental conditions experienced by each assemblage.

Several methods have been reviewed and employed including in situ stress measurements, loads on the Molikpaq offshore caisson, shoreline pile-up events, pile-ups and rubble fields on offshore shoals and relic berms, analysis of shear walls on offshore rubble fields, and analysis of deep ridge keels. Over 50 different events are identified with 33 suitable for a <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> analysis.
