Ductile {{honeycombs}} under in-plane biaxial loads fail by elastic buckling, plastic yielding {{and fast}} fracture of solid <b>cell</b> <b>edges,</b> while brittle honeycombs fail by elastic buckling, brittle rupturing and fast fracture of solid <b>cell</b> <b>edges.</b> In the paper, {{we aim at}} summarizing the modeling and theoretical expressions for describing the failure surfaces of honeycombs with non-uniform thickness <b>cell</b> <b>edges</b> under in-plane biaxial loads. Hence, the failure surfaces of ductile honeycombs with plateau borders are generated and found {{to be dependent on}} the solid distribution in <b>cell</b> <b>edges</b> and the yielding strengths of solid <b>cell</b> <b>edges.</b> Also, the failure surfaces of brittle honeycombs with plateau borders are significantly affected by the cell-edge modulus of rupture and the solid distribution in <b>cell</b> <b>edges...</b>|$|R

40|$|T and B {{lymphocytes}} {{from normal}} individuals and patients with T and B {{chronic lymphocytic leukaemia}} (TCLL and BCLL) were induced to spread on a solid surface {{in the presence of}} Con A. The proportion of cell circumference exhibiting lamellar activity was considerably greater in T than in B cells. This difference also applied to T and B cells with a single leading lamellipodium. The different pattern of formation of active <b>cell</b> <b>edges</b> implied that the degree of polarity measured as the ratio between the largest and the shortest diameter (over the nucleus) was significantly greater in B than in T cells. This was also obvious when T and B cells, both with a single leading lamellipodium, were compared. The formation of active <b>cell</b> <b>edges</b> in T lymphocytes was generally accompanied by nuclear flattening, even in polar cells with a single leading lamellipodium. B cells, {{with the exception of one}} BCLL case, did not exhibit nuclear flattening. Thus, during the entire course of a contact-induced morphogenetic response, T- and B-cell leukaemias were easily distinguishable on the basis of the following criteria: (i) the proportion of the lymphocyte perimeter showing active <b>cell</b> <b>edges,</b> (ii) the degree of polarity and (iii) nuclear flattening...|$|R

50|$|Oxygen and argon under {{pressure}} {{at room temperature}} form several different alloys with different crystal structures. Argon atoms and oxygen molecules are similar in size, so that a greater range of miscibility occurs compared to other gas mixtures.
