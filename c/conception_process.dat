2500|$|The {{introduction}} of Martha {{as the next}} companion after Billie Piper's Rose Tyler was announced by the BBC in a 5 July 2006 press release. The character is a 23-year-old medical student from 2008, although earlier in the <b>conception</b> <b>process</b> she had been meant {{to come from the}} year 1914. Like Rose, Martha has family members who are seen in the programme: Adjoa Andoh plays her mother Francine, with Trevor Laird as her father Clive (divorced from Francine), Gugu Mbatha-Raw as her sister Tish, and Reggie Yates as her brother Leo. Nevertheless, Agyeman notes that Martha is [...] "very independent"; living alone and having almost completed her medical qualifications. She does not have an ex-boyfriend, but writer Russell T Davies has stated that she is not a lesbian, as had been rumoured in some quarters. An article in The Times speculated that, since Agyeman has martial arts skills, she may have [...] "a more physical approach" [...] to the role. As with her predecessor Rose, Martha is from London; Brett Mills from the University of East Anglia presumes this is because characters from the capital of the country are [...] "therefore relatable to all British people" [...] because they are seen as [...] "neutral".|$|E

50|$|Study {{of weather}} {{patterns}} and other physical phenomena in the 20th century {{has shown that}} very minor changes in conditions at time T have drastic effects at all times after T. Compare this to the romantic involvement of future childbearing partners. Any actions taken today, at time T, will affect who exists {{after only a few}} generations. For instance, a significant change in global environmental policy would shift the conditions of the <b>conception</b> <b>process</b> so much that after 300 years none of the same people that would have been born are in fact born. Different couples meet each other and conceive at different times, and so different people come into existence. This is known as the 'non-identity problem'.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In process {{modelling}} {{it is not}} adequate enough to concentrate only on the mechanical process structure. We {{also need to be}} aware of mental aspects of the people involved. In this paper we are proposing an interview framework to capture <b>process</b> <b>conceptions.</b> Firstly we introduce the theories behind the framework: they are the Process Ontological Model, a classification of process models and a theory of basic modelling situation. Then an interview framework to capture <b>process</b> <b>conceptions</b> is proposed. Lastly we discuss about an example of using the framework as a tool in investigating <b>process</b> <b>conceptions</b> in customer requirements discovery. We are suggesting that by using the framework we are able to draw up a wider and more flexible approach to capture <b>process</b> <b>conceptions</b> in modelling situations...|$|R
40|$|More {{than five}} million babies {{have been born}} by the {{application}} of assisted conception methods throughout the world, and about 1 % to 2 % of babies in developed countries are born by the help of assisted reproductive techniques (ART) in couples with infertility. In spite of huge developments in equipments, techniques, pro-cedures, supplies and greater control of environmental factors which affect assisted <b>conception</b> <b>processes,</b> there is mounting concern regarding anomalies and birth defects from assisted conception in the community and, especially, among infertile couples. Although this concern is very low compared {{to the time of}} applica-tion of IVF technology three decades ago, but results of more comprehensive longitudinal studies have re-vealed increased risk of congenital anomalies, malformation and early pregnancy loss associated with ART(1). What really increases the defects, or whether these defects are transferred through parental gametes to the offspring or whether suboptimal in vitro conditions cause permanent changes in gametes or embryos that will influence the future life of IVF babies are not clearly known yet. Comparison of babies conceived through ART with babies of infertile/subfertile couples conceived without these techniques and those of fertile cou-ples emphasize the role of optimization of assisted <b>conception</b> <b>processes</b> on their success rate and on the pre-sent and future health of these babies...|$|R
5000|$|The {{idea for}} the {{character}} came from a modern Japanese perception of the indigenous Ainu people of Hokkaido, being depicted as revering nature and peacefully coexisting with it.

She was notably the first fighting game character brought back to life following her demise. An alternate, palette swap version of her with tanned skin and different colors of hair and eyes, known as Purple Nakoruru (Murasaki Nakoruru), is a recurring Easter egg type character that evolved into Rera.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new interactive UIDE {{that is based}} on visual programming and constrained sketch drawing. At {{the early stages of the}} iterative <b>conception</b> <b>process,</b> GUIs are interactively designed by drawing a "rough sketch" that acts as a first draft of the final description. This drawing is interpreted in real time by the system in order to produce the corresponding widget view (i. e. the actual visible GUI) and a graph of abstract objects that represents the GUI structure. This graph can then be easily modified by mixing visual and textual programming in a fully iterative and incremental way. This system is also based on the use of generic objects which are dynamically instantiated into actual widgets according to their structural and functional context. This scheme makes it possible to define very generic GUIs that can then be deeply refined in an efficient way at any stage of the <b>conception</b> <b>process.</b> KEYWORDS: user interface design, interface builders, visual programming, sketc [...] ...|$|E
30|$|D 3 aims at {{creating}} innovative requirements to build better solutions. It {{is based on}} the following assumptions: Design fulfillment is very important for success. Design is an event randomly occurring during the <b>conception</b> <b>process.</b> This is the key to innovation. The best design is always the result of continuous facilitation and refinement. In 1999, Martin Fowler published his book “Refactoring” (Fowler 1999) to improve the design of any existing code. He states that badly designed software can be reworked into a good one by refactoring the code continuously. He provides principles of refactoring which go hand in hand by setting up required tests to validate the refactored code (Lockard 2017).|$|E
40|$|International audienceEvery analog {{designer}} has to {{face with}} the legacy of the traditional analog development, an iterative <b>conception</b> <b>process</b> where a single computation loop can last a week. The tremendous gap between the analog and the digital world’s methodology of conception is sharper than ever. The reasons should be found both in the lack of automated tools and in the methodology itself. If a few commercial and academic softwares offer development environments, these environments do not easily allow creating analog generators because of lack of clear methodology. This paper presents a guideline for designing smart and reusable analog generators as an answer to the problem of analog IPs...|$|E

40|$|The « logical framework » is a {{rational}} tool for public action, {{based on a}} planning perspective focusing on objectives, indicators and expected outcomes. Omnipresent in development institutions, it emphasises a strictly managerial perspective centred on quantifiable factors, legitimization of action, linear and mechanical causality and a positivist epistemology now largely outmoded.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide {{insights}} into nine primary school teachers’ concerns and instructional needs in biology and mathematics, grades 1 to 6. By using Content Representation, combined with Learning Study in an action research project, teachers were encouraged to reflect on their <b>conceptions,</b> <b>processes</b> of instructing and pupil learning. From concerns articulated by teachers three instructional needs emerged: (i) to make subject progression, especially in biology, and pupil learning more visible, (ii) to develop mathematics teaching in order to change pupils’ views of the subject, and (iii) to develop teachers’ subject matter knowledge and teaching in an ongoing collaborative process. The paper argues that in order to stimulate teacher professional development it is important to make teacher concerns and thereby needs explicit. They help teachers to identify and reflect on relations between teacher subject matter knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge and pupil learning. </p...|$|R
