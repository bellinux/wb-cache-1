40|$|Abstract The Irish Problem is an Ethno-Religious {{dispute in}} essence {{that has a}} long {{historical}} process and engages world public opinion for many years In general this problem has begun with the British occupation of the island of Ireland and then it has transform to Christian sect problem after the imposition of Protestantism under British controlled communities by Tudor dynasty. But Irish people resisted to such sectarian transformation and keep their Catholic belief. This situation led to many religious oriented wars and destruction throughout many centuries. In the Ireland, {{on the one hand}} the sectarian differences have become factious or divergence factor between Catholics and Protestants, on the other hand, such situation led to unification affects and develop “we” feeling among these sect followers. In this respect, all kind of war, rebellion and other violence events between Protestants and Catholics led to contribute emergence of common national conscious among both religious groups and carry to Irish problem until today‟s agenda. This study tries to examine Irish dispute in the ethno-religious context and consisting from two parts excluding introduction and conclusion. In the first part, the historical development process of Irish problem and also important <b>cornerstone</b> <b>historical</b> events were examined. In the second part, the important factors and issues that deeply affected Irish problem and also emergence of nationalist movement...|$|E

40|$|In 2000, EU {{citizens}} exercised for {{the first}} time their recent acquired rights of local political participation, either as a vote or a candidate. But nationality remains an essential instrument for any discussion on participation, especially political. In Belgium, I was a subject of debate from the 1960 s while becoming of major concern and interest during the 1990 s. The main <b>cornerstones</b> of this <b>historical</b> dynamic in terms of active civic participation of immigrants in Belgium is revisited in this chapter. This historical process leading to a greater political participation have been clearly given impetus because of not only the European unification process with the economic incentives and the necessary labour mobility but also thanks to the mobilization of actors and civil society...|$|R
40|$|Crime, violence, and {{insecurity}} {{are perceived as}} society’s biggest problems in contemporary Costa Rica. This degree of priority is especially remarkable because the country has always been considered the peaceful exception in the violent Central American region. In this paper I analyze four cornerstones of the nonviolent national self-perception in the 1940 s and 1980 s as the fundamental basis for the current talk of crime: the civil war, {{the abolition of the}} military, the proclamation of neutrality, and the peace plan for Central America and the subsequent granting of the Nobel Peace Prize. The result of the analysis is the determination that these <b>historical</b> <b>cornerstones</b> were not publicly discussed as expressions of the nonviolent identity for which they are today cited as evidence. Costa Rica, violence, crime, social order, national identity, public discourse...|$|R
40|$|Gee Vaucher’s {{work with}} [British anarcho-punk band] Crass showed her both {{exploiting}} and extending {{the possibilities of}} record cover art, for political and creative purposes. She worked {{at the tail end}} of the high popularity of record cover art, an interdisciplinary art form that burgeoned in the 1960 s and 1970 s, wrapping, protecting, packaging and enhancing the new music, and which began to diminish in size and importance with the onset of digital music consumption from the 1980 s on (CDs then downloads). Steve Jones and Martin Sorger note that ‘[v]isually, the 12 -inch square of the album cover has proven a fertile forum for the development of a rich sense of cultural, artistic, and social history’, and argue that the record cover ‘is the <b>historical</b> <b>cornerstone</b> of pre-recorded music packaging’. In the 1960 s and 1970 s, record companies and artists produced increasingly ‘elaborate packages. Album covers incorporated die-cuts, embossing, multiple gate-folds, books, posters, and assorted gimmicky constructions and novelties. One variety included covers shaped after the paraphernalia of rock: speakers, amps, concert tickets, record players, and so on’. Vaucher and Crass, during the band’s active existence from 1977 to 1984, extended the boundaries of record cover art in both 7 ” and 12 ” forms. Vaucher’s art was a sustained challenge to the idea that the record cover was a subsidiary artefact to the music of the record itself...|$|R
