5|$|There {{are several}} {{criticisms of the}} three-tiered {{scrutiny}} analysis, the most <b>compelling</b> <b>reason</b> against its adoption arguably being {{that it does not}} control judicial discretion: the identification of classifications as suspect, quasi-suspect or non-suspect involves unconstrained balancing of public and private interests, and political and social interests.|$|E
5|$|The South financed a {{much lower}} {{proportion}} of its expenditures through direct taxes than the North. The share of direct taxes in total revenue for the North was about 20%, while for the South the same share was only about 8%. A {{major part of the}} reason why tax revenue did not play as large a role for the Confederacy was the individual states' opposition to a strong central government and the belief in states' rights which precluded giving too much taxing power to the government in Richmond. Another factor for not extending the tax system more broadly was the belief, present in both the North and the South, that the war would be of limited duration, and hence there was no <b>compelling</b> <b>reason</b> to increase the tax burden.|$|E
5|$|The High Court's {{decision}} was overruled by the Court of Appeal. The Court {{held that the}} Registrar had given genuine consideration to Komoco's arguments. It found that the Registrar had been entitled to take, prima facie, the Customs' OMV figures as correct unless they had {{been shown to be}} incorrect. Although the Registrar had been disposed to follow the Customs' OMV, she had equally been concerned to find out whether there had been sufficient reasons for her not to follow the administrative convention. Komoco had neither challenged the sworn evidence given by the Registrar by applying to cross-examine her, nor adduced any evidence to disprove the Registrar's sworn statement. There was thus no merit in Komoco's contention that the Registrar had not given genuine consideration to its representation. Furthermore, Komoco had not provided new evidence not already presented to the Customs to justify a departure from the administrative convention. Therefore, there had not been any <b>compelling</b> <b>reason</b> for the Registrar to re-evaluate her decision. She had adequately justified her refusal to depart from the policy, and had not fettered her discretion.|$|E

5|$|The strict {{qualifications}} {{required of}} presidential candidates resulted in walkovers during {{the elections of}} 1999, 2005 and 2017. The incumbent President Ong Teng Cheong did not run {{for a second term}} at the 1999 presidential election, saying that he had no <b>compelling</b> <b>reason</b> to do so. In addition to the eventual winner, Sellapan Ramanathan (better known as S. R. Nathan), the other potential candidates were Tan Soo Phuan, a member of the opposition Workers' Party of Singapore; and Ooi Boon Ewe, a private tutor turned real estate executive. Both of them were found not to have met the criteria to stand for election. As a result, Nathan, a former civil servant and Ambassador to the United States, was deemed to have been elected President. At the presidential election of 2005, the persons who applied for a certificate of eligibility to contest the election were Nathan, Ooi and Ramachandran Govindasamy Naidu. However, as Nathan was again the only candidate issued with a certificate, he was elected by default on nomination day.|$|E

40|$|A {{definitive}} design/performance {{study was}} performed on a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) airbreathing propelled orbital vehicle with rocket propulsion augmentation in the Access to Space activities during 1993.

25|$|The {{defendant}} {{may move}} to dismiss an {{action on the}} ground of FNC. Invoking this doctrine usually means that the plaintiff properly invoked the jurisdiction of the court, but it is inconvenient for the court and the defendant to have a trial in the original jurisdiction. The court must balance convenience against the plaintiff‚Äôs choice of forum. In other words, if the plaintiff‚Äôs choice of forum was reasonable, the defendant must show a <b>compelling</b> <b>reason</b> to change jurisdiction. If a transfer would simply shift the inconvenience from one party to the other, the plaintiff‚Äôs choice of forum should not be disturbed.|$|E
25|$|Smith and Black {{had argued}} that at the very least, the Court should only uphold Oregon's ban on peyote as applied to them if Oregon had a {{compelling}} interest in prohibiting their religious use of peyote. The Court had invalidated three other unemployment compensation restrictions under this standard. But those other restrictions themselves required consideration of individualized circumstances, such as when unemployment compensation was denied {{to a person who}} could not, for religious reasons, work on Saturdays. If a state has in place a system of individualized consideration, the constitution did not allow the state to refuse to extend that system to cases of religious hardship without a <b>compelling</b> <b>reason.</b>|$|E

25|$|At first, their nonchalance proved justified: Toungoo's annual dry-season raids of Lower Burma (1534‚Äì37) all failed while Pegu {{could not}} {{organize}} a counterattack against either Toungoo or Martaban. Closer to the battleground, however, King Narapati of Prome was increasingly concerned by Toungoo's deeper and longer raids with each successive campaign, {{and raised the}} alarm with Ava. In 1538, Prome, presumably with Ava's permission, entered into an alliance with Takayutpi. Though he had now taken sides, Thohanbwa still did not see a <b>compelling</b> <b>reason</b> to commit his troops, or ask his Confederation allies for additional troops.

25|$|Starting {{from the}} {{argument}} that a historical universal scientific method does not exist, Feyerabend argues that science does not deserve its privileged status in western society. Since scientific points of view do not arise from using a universal method which guarantees high quality conclusions, he thought {{that there is no}} justification for valuing scientific claims over claims by other ideologies like religions. Feyerabend also argued that scientific accomplishments such as the moon landings are no <b>compelling</b> <b>reason</b> to give science a special status. In his opinion, it is not fair to use scientific assumptions about which problems are worth solving in order to judge the merit of other ideologies. Additionally, success by scientists has traditionally involved non-scientific elements, such as inspiration from mythical or religious sources.|$|E

Under some circumstances ritual worship can be shortened or combined (according to prescribed procedures). In case a ritual worship is not performed at the right time, it must be performed later.|$|E
