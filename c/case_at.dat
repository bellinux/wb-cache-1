In 1062, {{he was one of the}} {{candidates}} to succeed Ealdred as bishop, when Ealdred was promoted to Archbishop of York, but Wulfstan was chosen instead. Æthelwig also served as a judge for King Edward the Confessor, at one point hearing a <b>case</b> <b>at</b> the royal court along with Wulfstan and Regenbald, the chancellor. The abbot also led military forces in battle, and served King Edward as an advisor.|$|E
5|$|Many {{courts have}} {{declined}} to assess the religious status of Scientology, finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the <b>case</b> <b>at</b> hand. The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was irrelevant, and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities. The German government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or worldview community and asserts that Scientology is a profit-making enterprise, rather than a religion.|$|E

40|$|Intraductal papillary-mucinous {{neoplasms}} (IPMNs) of {{the pancreas}} are ideal neoplasms to study clonal progression and genetic diversity {{because of their}} large size and prominent intraductal component. We microdissected 55 histologically defined areas from 13 IPMNs, extracted the DNA from each, and performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based microsatellite analysis to detect loss of heterozygosity on chromosome arms 1 p, 3 p, 6 q, 8 p, 9 p, 17 p, 18 q, and 22 q. LOH was identified at 1 p in two <b>cases,</b> <b>at</b> 3 p in four <b>cases,</b> <b>at</b> 6 q in seven <b>cases,</b> <b>at</b> 8 p in four <b>cases,</b> <b>at</b> 9 p in eight <b>cases,</b> <b>at</b> 17 p in five <b>cases,</b> <b>at</b> 18 q in five <b>cases,</b> and <b>at</b> 22 q {{in one of the}} IPMNs examined. In one of the IPMNs, the allelic losses were uniform throughout multiple microdissected areas, and in four of the IPMNs, there was evidence of clonal progression. In contrast, in three of the IPMNs, substantial allelic heterogeneity was seen. This remarkable heterogeneity may, in part, be due to the slow growth rate of these neoplasms...|$|R

5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt by the}} defence to {{question}} the court's jurisdiction, several witnesses were questioned {{over a period of}} several weeks, including Udin's neighbours and wife, as well as Sudarmo's nephew. The hearings, which were held on Mondays and Thursdays, were filled with spectators. At the trial, the defence suggested that a government conspiracy may have been responsible, but were told by the tribunal to focus on the <b>case</b> <b>at</b> hand. Further witnesses, including a key witness for the prosecution, came across as unconvincing; they also changed their stories, reneging statements which they had made before the trial. Other witnesses for the prosecution, including several of Sumaji's neighbours, testified that the driver could not have committed the murder because he was at home on the night of 13 August. Another said that the steel pipe said to be the murder weapon in court was different from that found with Udin's blood on it.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{designed}} to be used with the QUAD II, 303, or 405 power amplifiers with limiters, a power amplifier capable of delivering 15 watts per channel suffices – excessive voltage input is known to cause arcing within the speaker panels. In fact, the instructions book states that any properly-regulated amplifier delivering no more than 33V is unlikely to cause damage to the speaker. Electrostatic speakers are more accurately rated by voltage, not power. In the ESL's <b>case,</b> <b>at</b> the rated nominal impedance of 16 ohms, the limit of 33 volts would be reached when the amplifier's power output reaches 15 watts (if it were driving a conventional load).|$|E
5|$|As {{had been}} the <b>case</b> <b>at</b> Northwestern, Notre Dame's {{football}} program {{was in a state}} of flux when Parseghian arrived. While Notre Dame built a proud history under Rockne and Frank Leahy, its two most successful coaches, the late 1950s and early 1960s had been a disaster. The team had finished 5–5 in 1962 under Joe Kuharich, who lost the confidence of his players and Notre Dame's administrators during his four years as coach. Kuharich's surprise departure at the end of that season to become supervisor of officials in the National Football League, a position created by his friend and NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, left the program in disarray. Devore, a long-time Notre Dame employee who had played for Rockne and coached under Leahy, was brought in to lead the team on an interim basis in 1963. Notre Dame managed only a 2–7 finish that year.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{architecture}} of English cathedrals is so diverse and inventive, the internal appearances differ a great deal. However, in general, English cathedral interiors tend to give an impression of length. This is in part {{because many of the}} buildings are actually very long, but also because more than in the medieval architecture of any other country, the horizontal direction is given as much visual emphasis as the vertical. This is particularly the <b>case</b> <b>at</b> Wells where, unlike most Gothic buildings, there are no vertical shafts that continue from the arcade to the vault and there is a very strong emphasis on the triforium gallery with its seemingly endless and undifferentiated row of narrow arches. Salisbury has a similar lack of verticals while the course below the triforium and the undecorated capitals of Purbeck stone create strong visual horizontals. In the cases of Winchester, Norwich and Exeter the horizontal effect is created by the emphasis on the ridge rib of the elaborate vaults.|$|E

5|$|Cosmetics {{testing on}} animals is banned in India, the European Union, Israel and Norway while {{legislation}} in the U.S. and Brazil is currently considering similar bans. In 2002, after 13 years of discussion, the European Union agreed to phase in a near-total ban {{on the sale of}} animal-tested cosmetics by 2009, and to ban all cosmetics-related animal testing. France, which is home to the world's largest cosmetics company, L'Oreal, has protested the proposed ban by lodging a <b>case</b> <b>at</b> the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, asking that the ban be quashed. The ban is also opposed by the European Federation for Cosmetics Ingredients, which represents 70 companies in Switzerland, Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy. In October 2014, India passed stricter laws that also ban the importation of any cosmetic products that are tested on animals.|$|E
5|$|From 1925, Bayern {{shared the}} Grünwalder Stadion with 1860 Munich. Until World War II, the stadium {{was owned by}} 1860 Munich, and is still colloquially known as Sechz'ger ("Sixties") Stadium. It was {{destroyed}} during the war, and efforts to rebuild it resulted in a patchwork. Bayern's record crowd at the Grünwalder Stadion is reported as more than 50,000 in the home game against 1. FC Nürnberg in the 1961–62 season. In the Bundesliga era the stadium had a maximum capacity of 44,000 which was reached on several occasions, but the capacity has since been reduced to 21,272.

5|$|Gov. Schwarzenegger again {{appealed to}} the Supreme Court, looking to {{overturn}} the Ninth Circuit's ruling, filing a writ of certiorari to the Court in May 2009. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the <b>case,</b> <b>at</b> this point filed as Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n. The fact that the Court accepted this case was considered surprising, based on the previous case record for such violent video game laws that were unanimously overturned in other states. Analysts believe that because the Court agreed to hear this case, there are unanswered questions between the protection of free speech from the First Amendment, and the legal enforcement of protecting minors from unprotected free speech such as through restrictions on the sales of pornography to minors. Just a week prior to {{the acceptance of the}} certiorari, in United States v. Stevens the Court overturned another law that sought restrictions on depictions of animal cruelty, which some analysts felt would reflect the Court's position to likely overturn the violent video game law.|$|E
