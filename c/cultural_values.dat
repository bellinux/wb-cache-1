40|$|In our {{analysis}} of the <b>cultural</b> <b>value</b> of the Royal Scottish Academy New Contemporaries Exhibition, we assessed the institution’s role in shaping emerging artists’ careers, as well as wider <b>cultural</b> <b>value.</b> Supported by our conceptual framework of value creation, issues assessed included the expected versus experienced value of the exhibition and the individual artworks, price setting, the market mechanism surrounding the exhibition, and its enhancement. The created <b>cultural</b> <b>value</b> is facilitated by high-visibility media exposure and through development of career-enhancing networks. We have generated new insight into <b>cultural</b> <b>value</b> more generally by moving beyond dominant instrumental valuation approaches. We have addressed many of the gaps in understanding the mechanisms behind engagement with contemporary art. We have progressed theory {{with the assistance of}} our conceptual framework and supporting qualitative data. <b>Cultural</b> <b>value</b> is expressed in contemporary art through artistic production systems and its cultural messages. Artists’ <b>cultural</b> <b>value</b> is often constructed via the intrinsic worth of their work, rather than from market influences. <b>Cultural</b> <b>value</b> is often personal to the viewer, shared with others and remembered over time. It is also co-created among the other stakeholders involved...|$|R
40|$|Why <b>cultural</b> <b>value?</b> This {{special issue}} {{is focused on}} the term for three reasons. In the UK, at least, the post {{election}} context will see the continuation of the government’s austerity programme, raising important questions of how culture is valued. These questions will be both in terms of the investment into the UK’s cultural system and also the attendant social status accorded to those forms and practices that continue to attract state supported. Second, the publication of the special issue intersects with the conclusion of the AHRC’s <b>Cultural</b> <b>Value</b> project. This was a major investment by the AHRC and funded over 70 individual pieces of research, across a host of arts and humanities disciplines. It is, therefore, timely to highlight how some of the specific research activities may complement each other. The third reason for a special issue on <b>cultural</b> <b>value</b> draws attention to the particular approach deployed across all of the articles collected here. Within the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Value</b> project, several pieces of research tried to engage with <b>cultural</b> <b>value</b> in empirical ways. This is unusual within arts and humanities, which has seen <b>cultural</b> <b>value</b> more closely associated with theoretical or art-form specific traditions. An empirical approach derived from humanities’ traditions is also an important complement and contrast with that of economics, the discipline most closely associated with existing empirical insights into <b>cultural</b> <b>value...</b>|$|R
40|$|Unravelling <b>cultural</b> <b>value</b> {{has long}} been {{attempted}} {{from a number of}} perspectives but it remains substantially unresolved. The discussion is about accountability with proponents disagreeing on whether this means stewardship of the public and trustee purse or fundamental aesthetic values. There are many reasons for this lack of agreement and thus the <b>cultural</b> <b>value</b> debates remain vibrant and healthy. However, it is also a truism that cultural related literature has been slow to recognise that <b>cultural</b> <b>value</b> serves different masters: the audience, organisational interface, the organisation, and government control. In past debates, value measurement has had a government control focus using neo classical economics and accounting to define and measure the cultural industry. Artists and other cultural stakeholders in society have critiqued such measurement as inappropriate. This paper seeks to unify these two dimensions by providing a synergistic definition of <b>cultural</b> <b>value,</b> which is pertinent to cultural organisations, and offers a model of entrepreneurial <b>cultural</b> <b>value</b> balance for the audience, cultural organisations and government. <br /...|$|R

5|$|If it {{is unclear}} what counts as science, how the process of {{confirming}} theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, values can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus. For example, in the 19th century, <b>cultural</b> <b>values</b> held by scientists about race shaped research on evolution, and values concerning social class influenced debates on phrenology (considered scientific at the time). Feminist philosophers of science, sociologists of science, and others explore how social values affect science.|$|E

The Tennessee Self-Concept Scale (TSCS) and the East-West Questionnaire (EWQ) were administered at pre- and post-semester to obtain scores on self-concept, its subcomponents, and Eastern <b>cultural</b> <b>value</b> orientation, respectively. ^ Null hypotheses stated there would be no significant differences among the groups on measures of self-concept, its subcomponents, and Eastern <b>cultural</b> <b>value</b> orientation. The levels of significance were set at p 3 ̆c 0. 05 for the self-concept and Eastern <b>cultural</b> <b>value</b> orientation scores and p 3 ̆c 0. 01 for the subcomponent scores. ^ The results showed no statistical significance among the groups on the measures of self-concept, its subcomponents, and Eastern <b>cultural</b> <b>value</b> orientation. Analysis of covariance was used since it {{has been shown to be}} useful to test for differences in mean scores among groups of subjects that occur naturally and intact in educational settings. Although the data indicated there were positive gains in mean scores on total self-concept and Eastern <b>cultural</b> <b>value</b> orientation for the control and the karate groups and negative gains on both variables for the swimming group, these changes were not statistically significant.

Even before the American show's debut, the CTW established an international division, which oversaw its licensing in other countries. According to Gregory J.

5|$|Contributors to Poedjangga Baroe were {{influenced}} by the Tachtigers, a Dutch literary movement from the 1880s. Sutherland suggests that the romantic theme prevalent in their works was adapted by the authors to escape the changing realities of Indonesian society. As opposed to earlier works published by Balai Pustaka such as Marah Rusli's Sitti Nurbaya (1922), which emphasized regional <b>cultural</b> <b>values,</b> prose published in Poedjangga Baroe focused on national identity, and writers included areas {{that they had never}} visited. Old themes, such as forced marriage, were abandoned. According to Sutherland, most contributors to Poedjangga Baroe kept a sense of ambivalence towards the Dutch colonial government as well as traditional culture as a central theme in their works. Although they rejected Dutch control of the archipelago, these nationalist writers embraced Western culture; Sutherland writes that some of the most staunchly nationalist writers were also the most westernized.|$|E
