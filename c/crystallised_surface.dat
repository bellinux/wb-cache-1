40|$|A {{distribution}} of the parameters representing activation energy of the ageing process within the Dissado-Montanari-Mazzanti (DMM) lifetime model {{has been shown to}} model experimental lifetime distributions of PET films well. The results imply small differences in the local environments of the moieties involved in the ageing process. Very small changes in the minimum activation energy values have a pronounced effect on the resultant lifetimes of polymer specimens. Changes in the distributions of activation energies with field and temperature can be explained by assuming the ageing process to be one whereby polymer segments on lamella <b>surfaces</b> <b>crystallise</b> to create free volume within the polymer...|$|R
5|$|In 1811, iodine was {{discovered}} by French chemist Bernard Courtois, who was born to a manufacturer of saltpeter (an essential component of gunpowder). At {{the time of the}} Napoleonic Wars, saltpeter was in great demand in France. Saltpeter produced from French nitre beds required sodium carbonate, which could be isolated from seaweed collected on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany. To isolate the sodium carbonate, seaweed was burned and the ash washed with water. The remaining waste was destroyed by adding sulfuric acid. Courtois once added excessive sulfuric acid and a cloud of purple vapour rose. He noted that the vapour <b>crystallised</b> on cold <b>surfaces,</b> making dark crystals. Courtois suspected that this material was a new element but lacked funding to pursue it further.|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of Riga Dome Cathedral was initiated in 1211, {{at the same}} time the Capithulum hall of Cathedral was built. In order to diminish the problems caused by moisture, during the last restoration (already in 1888 - 1891) the walls of Capithulum hall were covered with damp proof sandwich-type plaster, consisting of cement – glass tile (ca 4 - 5 mm thick) – cement. Thus the evaporation of water through the walls is hindered. Soluble salts <b>crystallise</b> on the <b>surface</b> of carvings dislocated above the level of historical hydroisolation and cause damages. The processes of corrosion of historical building materials of Capithulum hall were studied from the viewpoint of moisture and salt migration. The type, range and distribution of salts and moisture in masonry of Capithulum hall were detected by qualitative and quantitative chemical analysis, measurement of physical properties and XRD analysis...|$|R
60|$|The descent {{was to a}} broad, open valley, {{into which}} the flank of Nango dipped in {{tremendous}} precipices, which reared their heads in splintered snowy peaks. At their bases were shoots of debris fully 700 feet high, sloping at a steep angle. Enormous masses of rock, detached {{by the action of}} the frost and ice from the crags, were scattered over the bottom of the valley; they had been precipitated from above, and gaining impetus in their descent, bad been hurled to almost inconceivable distances from the parent cliff. All were of a very white, fine-grained crystallised granite, full of small veins of the same rock still more finely <b>crystallised.</b> The weathered <b>surface</b> of each block was black, and covered with moss and lichens; the others beautifully white, with clean, sharp-fractured edges. The material of which they were composed was so hard that I found it difficult to detach a specimen.|$|R

Results indicated that graphene influences the crystallisation and crystal structure of iPP and PEO. WAXD peaks shifting toward lower diffraction angle, i. e. increase in d-pacing, was observed in both PEO and iPP <b>crystallised</b> on the <b>surface</b> of graphene. The change of d-spacing of both PEO and iPP could result from the compressive stress caused by graphene. A shift of 2 D band in graphene was observed from Raman spectra. The Raman spectra indicated the big shift in the 2 D band {{is due to the}} presence of stress induced strain in the polymer attached graphene. The residual stress was generated during crystallization of the polymers on the surface of graphene. Due to the interactions between the graphene and the polymers, the stress was transferred to the graphene which leads to a strain of the graphene.

30|$|The same {{apparent}} {{decrease of}} salt contents with decreasing saturation level {{is found in}} the drill samples. This is surprising and not readily understandable as all samples were treated with the same amounts of saline solution; thus, the absolute amount of salts should be independent from the water content of the sample. This phenomenon can be explained be significant surficial efflorescence during the drying process. These salt crystals were scratched from the surface before drilling which explains the apparent mass loss (in future work, this problem might be solved by accurate weighing and analysis of the removed material, which was neglected). In the drilling dust, the strongest decrease in ion content is found at the lowest saturation levels. From about 25 % downwards the conductivity of all sample curves are strongly declining. The same result was obtained by the IC (mg l− 1). From the drilling profiles we can see that the amount of salt ions is almost uniform at low saturation degrees. These results are in contrast to intermediate saturation, where a well visible (decreasing) gradient between the stone surface and all deeper locations occurs. This result further underpins that salt ions favourably <b>crystallise</b> near the <b>surface</b> {{in the course of the}} dehydration process (e.g. [29]; however, a certain minimum moisture content needs to be maintained for an effective salt transport towards the surface.|$|R
40|$|Densification {{of calcium}} {{hydroxyapatite}} fine powders doped with different concentrations of Mg (2, 4 and 6 mol % Mg, MgHA) was successfully achieved {{for the first}} time in a nearly fully dense state using the hydrothermal hot pressing (HHP) technique at low temperatures. Consolidation of MgHA powders was studied under different temperatures (150 – 240 °C), reaction times (1 – 6 h), and powder particle size (20 nm– 1. 5 μm). X-Ray diffraction analyses indicated that the particle densification under HHP conditions proceeded without any variation in the crystalline structure and regardless of the Mg content. The results from this work showed that an increase in temperature accelerates the reaction between MgHA particles and water (solvent) mixed during the hydrothermal treatment. Particle packing associated with bulk densification was achieved through a massive dissolution-recrystallisation mechanism, which induced the formation of small particles that rapidly <b>crystallised</b> on the <b>surface</b> of the partially dissolved original MgHA particles. The optimum conditions to obtain pellets with a high apparent density of 3. 0758 ± 0. 001 g/cm 3 and tensile strength value of 12. 6 ± 0. 6 MPa were 10 wt% of water at a temperature of 240 °C with a 6 h reaction time and 6 mol % of Mg (MgHA 3). The use of the HHP technique coupled with the fine particle size and reactivity of the MgHA precursor powders with water allowed us to produce disks that were compacted to a nearly full dense state with a low content of open porosity of 2. 0 %...|$|R
40|$|There {{is often}} a need to improve the taste of mineral water by {{reducing}} the sulphate ion content. It was found that for such an effect, nanofiltration (NF) process can be used. In the case, the proposed formula was assumed obtaining a mineral water with reduction of H 2 S and SO 42 - content through the following processes: stripping - UF/MF or rapid fi ltration - nanofiltration - mixing with raw water or filtration through calcium bed. The paper shows {{the results of the}} tests, with use of mineral waters and nanofiltration. Commercial nanofiltration membranes NF- 270 Dow Filmtec and NF-DK GE Infrastructure Water&Process Technologies were applied. NF was carried out for mixed water from both water intakes (1 and 2), recovery of 50 %, at transmembrane pressure of 0. 8 - 1. 2 MPa in the dead-end fi ltration mode. In addition, the permeate obtained in NF was filtered through a column fi lled with 1. 0 - 3. 0 mm limestone rock, in order to improve the composition of mineral water. The tested mineral water is the sulphate-chloride-sodium-calcium-magnesium in nature and contains 991 mg/L of SO 42 - and 2398 mg/L of TDS, while the permeate after NF showed the chloride - sodium hydrogeochemical type (TDS: 780 - 1470 mg/L, sulfate 10 - 202. 7 mg/L, calcium 23 - 39. 7 mg/L, magnesium 11 - 28 mg/L). As a result of water treatment in the NF process, high reduction of SO 42 - ions was obtained (79 - 98. 7 %), while the TDS was reduced in 51 - 64 %. Because the process of NF allows for relatively high reduction of bivalent ions, a significant reduction in calcium ion content (84 - 88 %) and magnesium (84 - 89 %) has been also obtained. Monovalent ions were reduced to a lesser extent, i. e. sodium in 46 % and bicarbonates in 39 - 64. 1 %. Despite obtaining the positive effect of the sulphate ions content reduction, the NF process significantly changed the mineralogy composition of water. The permeate filtration (DK-NF membrane) on the CaCO 3 deposit led to a correction of the hydrogeochemical type of water from chloridesodium to chloride-bicarbonate-sodium. The concentration of calcium ions was increased by 60. 5 % and was 28. 2 mg/L, and bicarbonate ions by 7. 78 % (increased to 195 mg/L). Based on a morphological assessment of the deposits in the SEM image and their chemical composition, the presence of gypsum crystals was detected {{on the surface of the}} NF- 270 membrane. The deposits formed on the NF-DK membrane were of a completely different character as aggregations of iron and aluminium oxides/hydroxides were found. Such significant mineralogical differences between the secondary deposits <b>crystallising</b> on the <b>surface</b> of the membranes point to the impact of several factors, including membrane characteristics, concentration polarisation, mass transport mechanisms, etc...|$|R
