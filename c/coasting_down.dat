That evening the family hides Tom under the mattresses of the truck just as guards arrive to question them; they are searching for the man who killed the guard. Tom avoids being spotted and the family leaves the Keene Ranch without further incident. After driving for a while, they have to stop {{at the top of a}} hill when the engine overheats due to a broken fan belt; they have little gas, but decide to try <b>coasting</b> <b>down</b> the hill to some lights. The lights are from a third type of camp: Farmworkers' Wheat Patch Camp (Weedpatch in the book), a clean camp run by the Department of Agriculture, complete with indoor toilets and showers, which the Joad children had never seen before.|$|E

[...] When the wheel strikes rocks and ruts, or under hard braking, the rider can be pitched forward off the bicycle head-first. [...] Headers were relatively common and a significant, sometimes fatal, hazard.

2500|$|... 2012: Kyle Busch won {{the race}} after passing Tony Stewart at the finish line. It was the closest finish in Bud Shootout history. The race itself, being the first Sprint Cup event under a new rules package {{designed}} {{to break up the}} controversial two-car tandem drafting of the previous year, was marked by three multi-car crashes during the race caused by drivers getting into the left-rear quarter panel of another car. The first crash happened in the first 25 lap segment when Paul Menard got into David Ragan in turn 2, starting an eight car crash. The drivers involved were: Kasey Kahne, Denny Hamlin, Matt Kenseth, Paul Menard, Jeff Burton, David Ragan, Juan Pablo Montoya and Michael Waltrip. The second one happened on lap 55, also in turn 2. This one started when Marcos Ambrose turned Joey Logano loose. Several other drivers were collected trying to avoid Logano, including Kenseth, Martin Truex, Jr., Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and Kevin Harvick. Harvick's brakes failed, and he ended up <b>coasting</b> <b>down</b> the apron with flames coming out from under his car, though they extinguished themselves before Harvick reached the garage. A third crash happened with two laps to go within regulation, when Jeff Gordon got into the back of eventual winner Kyle Busch on turn 4. While Kyle retained control of his car, Gordon shot up the banking and collected Jimmie Johnson, Jamie McMurray and Kurt Busch, and turned sideways on the driver's side door. Gordon was pushed down the track on his side for several hundred feet before his car barrel-rolled three times and came to a rest on his roof.|$|E
40|$|Real-world CO 2 {{emissions}} of passenger cars very often deviate from the Type Approval value. The Type Approval value for CO 2 {{emissions of}} passenger cars {{is based on}} a chassis dynamometer test in a laboratory. The total vehicle resistance of a vehicle, or 'road load', is simulated on the chassis dynamometer to obtain representative emissions. The road load of a vehicle is determined by means of a <b>coast</b> <b>down</b> test. As a large number of parameters and external conditions influence the <b>coast</b> <b>down</b> test, the Type Approval procedures for performing the <b>coast</b> <b>down</b> test allow for certain margins within which certain test parameters should lie. These margins can partly explain the difference between the real-world and Type Approval CO 2 emissions. TNO investigated the effect of variations in test parameters during the execution of a <b>coast</b> <b>down</b> test on the vehicleâ€™s road load by performing a series of <b>coast</b> <b>down</b> measurements.

2500|$|Woolf {{wrote about}} meeting Sackville-West in 1925: [...] "Vita shines in the grocer's shop in Sevenoaks...pink growing, grape clustered, pearl hung...There is her {{maturity}} and full-breastedness; her being so much full in sail {{on the high}} tides, where I am <b>coasting</b> <b>down</b> backwaters; her capacity I mean to take the floor in any company, to represent her country, to visit Chatsworth, to control silver, servants, chow dogs, her motherhood...her in short being (what I have never been) a real woman". [...] Sackville-West greatly admired Woolf's writings, declaring in a 1925 letter: [...] "My darling, last night I went to bed early and read Mrs. Dalloway-It was a very curious sensation: I thought {{you were in the}} room...I was very unhappy because I had a row with my mother and very happy because of you; so it felt like being two different people at the same time...I felt quite light, as though I was falling through my bed, like when one has a high fever. Today I am quite solid again and my boots are quite muddy. They weigh me down. Yet I am not solid as usual-not quite an oaf-because there is {{at the back of my}} mind all the time...a glow, a sort of nebula, which only when I examine it hardens into a shape; as soon as I think of something else it dissolves again, remaining there like the sun through a fog and I have to reach out again, to take it into my hands & feel its contours: then it hardens, [...] "Virginia is coming on Saturday!". Sackville-West considered Woolf to be the better writer, telling Woolf in one letter: [...] "I contrast my illiterate writing with your scholarly one, and I am ashamed". Though Woolf envied Sackville-West's ability to quickly turn out books compared to her laborious efforts to turn out a novel, she was inclined to agree with this assessment, writing in her diary that A Passenger to Tehran was written too much in haste as [...] "Vita's prose is too fluent". Before going on her second trip to Persia in 1927, a chastened Sackville-West, after receiving several letters from Woolf telling her not to churn out books, wrote to Woolf: [...] "I shall work so hard , partly to please you and partly to please myself...I treasure your sudden discourse on literature yesterday morning, a send-off to me, rather like Polonius to Laertes. It is quite true that you have had infinitely more influence on me intellectually than anyone else, and for this alone, I love you...You do like me to write well, don't you? And I do hate writing badly-and having written so badly in the past. But now, like Queen Victoria, I will be good".|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of wavelet analysis to diagnose loose blades condition in gas turbines is {{examined in this}} paper. Experimental studies were undertaken to simulate loose blades condition occurring in gas turbines {{in an attempt to}} understand vibration response associated with loose blades under different operating conditions. Results showed that loose blades were undetectable under steady state operating condition. During turbine <b>coast</b> <b>down,</b> a loose blade could be detected based on the impactic signals induced by the loose blades on the rotor and thus excited the natural frequencies of the rotor assembly. Results from the <b>coast</b> <b>down</b> condition showed that wavelet analysis was more sensitive and effective than Fourier analysis for loose blade diagnosis. The severity, the number, and the configuration of the loose blades could be potentially estimated based on the pattern of the <b>coast</b> <b>down</b> wavelet map...|$|R

This river, though still very swift, was almost perfectly smooth here, and showed a very visible declivity, a regularly inclined plane, for several miles, like a mirror set a little aslant, on which we coasted down. It was very exhilarating, and the perfection of traveling, the <b>coasting</b> <b>down</b> this inclined mirror between two evergreen forests edged with lofty dead white pines, sometimes slanted half-way over the stream. I saw some monsters there, nearly destitute of branches, and scarcely diminishing in diameter for eighty or ninety feet.|$|E
60|$|One {{school of}} bonitas, {{numbering}} many thousands, stayed with us {{day and night}} for more than three weeks. Aided by the Snark, it was great hunting; for they cut a swath of destruction through the ocean half a mile wide and fifteen hundred miles in length. They ranged along abreast of the Snark on either side, pouncing upon the flying- fish her forefoot scared up. Since they were continually pursuing astern the flying-fish that survived for several flights, they were always overtaking the Snark, and at any time one could glance astern and on the front of a breaking wave see scores of their silvery forms <b>coasting</b> <b>down</b> just under the surface. When they had eaten their fill, it was their delight to get {{in the shadow of the}} boat, or of her sails, and a hundred or so were always to be seen lazily sliding along and keeping cool.|$|E

60|$|Nothing notable beyond such {{pleasing}} generalities of {{path and}} people lay in our way, till {{we came to}} a place where a steep and perfectly smooth clay bank shot from a spur of the hills directly into the thoroughfare. Three urchins were industriously putting this to its proper use, <b>coasting</b> <b>down</b> it, that is, on the seats of what did them for breeches. An over-grown-up regard for my own trousers alone deterred me from instantly following suit. No such scruples prevented my abetting them, however, to the extent of a trifling bribe for a repetition. For they had stopped abashed as soon as they found they had a public. Regardless of maternal consequences, I thus encouraged the sport. But after all, was it so much a bribe as an entrance fee to the circus, or better yet, a sort of subsidy from an ex-member of the fraternity? Surely, if adverse physical circumstances preclude profession in person, the next best thing is to become a noble patron of art.|$|E
60|$|While he {{was slowly}} toiling {{up the last}} long hill, Sid was <b>coasting</b> <b>down</b> on the other side, eager to display his courage and skill before the girls,--being of an age when boys begin to wish to please and astonish the gentler creatures whom they have {{hitherto}} treated with indifference or contempt. It was a foolish thing to do, for the road was rough, with steep banks on either side, and a sharp turn at the end; but Sid rolled gayly along, with an occasional bump, till a snake ran across the road, making the horse shy, the girls scream, the rider turn {{to see what was}} the matter, and in doing so lose his balance just when a large stone needed to be avoided. Over went Sid, down rattled the wheel, up rose a cloud of dust, and sudden silence fell upon the girls at sight of this disaster. They expected their gallant escort would spring up and laugh over his accident; but when he remained flat upon his back, where he had alighted after a somersault, with the bicycle spread over him like a pall, they were alarmed, and flew to the rescue.|$|E
60|$|She {{might well}} say that, for she got very little herself, and her trials had been many, her efforts not always successful, and her reward seemed {{a long way}} off. Poor Boo could have sympathized with her, for he had {{suffered}} much persecution from his small schoolmates when he appeared with large gray patches on the little brown trousers, where he had worn them out <b>coasting</b> <b>down</b> those too fascinating steps. As {{he could not see}} the patches himself, he fancied them invisible, and came home much afflicted by the jeers of his friends. Then Molly tried to make him a new pair out of a sack of her own; but she cut both sides for the same leg, so one was wrong side out. Fondly hoping no one would observe it, she sewed bright buttons wherever they could be put, and sent confiding Boo away in a pair of blue trousers, which were absurdly hunchy behind and buttony before. He came home heart-broken and muddy, having been accidentally tipped into a mud-puddle by two bad boys who felt that such tailoring was an insult to mankind. That roused Molly's spirit, and she begged her father to take the boy and have him properly fitted out, as he was old enough now to be well-dressed, and she wouldn't have him tormented. His attention being called to the trousers, Mr. Bemis had a good laugh over them, and then got Boo a suit which caused him to be the admired of all observers, and to feel as proud as a little peacock.|$|E

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{rotating machinery}} during deceleration {{when the power}} of the drive to the rotating machinery is stopped is known as <b>Coast</b> <b>Down</b> Phenomenon (CDP). The total time elapsed for the entire momentum due to sustained operation of the rotating machinery to dissipate is known as <b>Coast</b> <b>Down</b> Time (CDT). The characteristic profile of CDT (CDT-P) depends on inertia forces of the machinery components, tribological behaviour and environmental effects such as fluid drag. The aim of the research is to investigate the potential and the feasibiJity of using CDT as an effective tool for condition monitoring of machinery. A review of current literature has given a clear understanding to what extent the CDP has been explored with respect to utilising it as a diagnostic parameter. However no evidence for effective use of CDT in condition based monitoring programmes can be found. The main focus of this research is concentrated on ascertaining the validity of <b>Coast</b> <b>Down</b> Time as one of the condition monitoring parameters for a horizontal rotor system. Extensive experimental analysis is conducted on a rotor system consisting of a journal bearing using different lubricants under various mechanical and operating conditions An empirical formula is developed to determine the <b>Coast</b> <b>Down</b> Factor (CDF). Furthermore, the effect of rub on the motor has been studied with the aid of an electromagnetic clutch and isolating the rotor from the drive system. This research has shown a novel way to interpret the CDT-P {{to be used as a}} diagnostic parameter in condition monitoring by the formulation of <b>Coast</b> <b>Down</b> Factor. CDF gives a simple, but highly flexible tool for CDT analysis. COT monitoring through the trend of CDF can be used to analyse the performance of a journal bearing under given tribological conditions; to utilise as a tool for optimisation of selection of lubrication oil; to evaluate and understand. the tribological behaviour of lubrication and the performance of a journal bearing under different oil pressures; and to diagnose the mechanical degradation with simulated unbalance to the rotor system.

60|$|John Meredith walked meditatively {{through the}} clear {{crispness}} of a winter night in Rainbow Valley. The hills beyond glistened with the chill splendid lustre of moonlight on snow. Every little fir {{tree in the}} long valley sang its own wild song to the harp of wind and frost. His children and the Blythe lads and lasses were <b>coasting</b> <b>down</b> the eastern slope and whizzing over the glassy pond.

Mr. Meredith liked very well on occasion to spend an evening arguing with the doctor by the drift wood fire, where the famous china dogs of Ingleside kept ceaseless watch and ward, as became deities of the hearth, but to-night he did not look that way.
