The paper uses {{the case of the}} Bank of Barclays to develop a methodology of uncooking the books from material misstatements of the financial industry. This research is about the current sub-prime markets crisis and shows how sub-prime mortgages, CDS and CSOs overstated the revenues of the financial services industries leading to the stock markets meltdown of October 2008. The paper attempts to develop regression models and software that detect fraud involved in the mortgages crisis and a method for fraud 'finger print' definition. This paper provides the readers with fundamental information about firms and auditors' misconduct. While this study researches primarily in the area of international economics and accounting, it also deals with computer information systems automation and specifically forensic accounting, expert witness testimony and computer litigation support. cooking the books, toxic paper, credit default swaps, CDS, <b>collateralised</b> <b>synthetic</b> <b>obligations,</b> CSOs, counterparty surveillance, material misstatements, sub-prime mortgages, collateralised debt obligations, financial fraud detection, forensic accounting, financial services industry, financial crisis, firm misconduct, auditor misconduct, international economics, information systems, expert witness testimony, computer litigation support,...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} on the pricing of synthetic credit risk securitisation. Securitisation is advantageous both for originating banks, who incur savings on bank capital costs and for investors, who acquire a stake in leveraged credit portfolio risk, an exposure type rarely accessible otherwise. Securitisation is cost-efficiently implemented by structured credit derivatives, issued securities are therefore referred to as <b>synthetic</b> <b>collateralised</b> debt <b>obligations</b> (CDOs). We perform arbitrage-free pricing of synthetic CDOs referring to investment grade European corporate debt, such that a comparison with observed transactions can be drawn. CDO payout rules are formalised, taking both direct risk transfer structures and synthetic transactions using SPVs for excess spread trapping into account. Underlying losses are captured by a reduced-form affine multi-factor model, exploiting the strong observed comovement of corporate spreads for systematic factor estimation. Estimation is performed by Kalman filter-based QML, applied to implied spread structures of recent European corporate bond issues to which originating banks are exposed. Valuation results are obtained {{for a variety of}} structural variants. A comparison with transactions accommodating our modelling approach with regard to payout rules and reference debt quality supports the hypothesis that investors have a strong preference for CDO investments: Observed note issuance spreads provide no adequate compensation for the leveraged portfolio risk exposure.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to critically analyse synthetic securitisation schemes in South African law as <b>synthetic</b> <b>collateralised</b> debt <b>obligations</b> using primarily credit default swaps (CDSs). This transpires {{from the perspective of}} primarily company law, and secondarily securities law and the law of contract. It includes a contextualised study of these schemes with regards to their origins, their significance regarding the recent financial crisis, and their rationales micro-economic influence and Basel capital requirements. Not only are the participants, such as parties acting in a primary role and secondary role and special-purpose institutions, studied, but also the obligations between these parties, such as the CDS contract, and the meaning of commercial paper, the legal nature of credit-linked notes, the business of a bank, and the influence of recent case law. It also includes a consideration of synthetic securitisation schemes in terms of the Collective Investment Schemes Control Act 45 of 2002. Furthermore, the role of systemic risk and moral hazard is explained, as well as the interaction between synthetic securitisation schemes, credit rating agencies and the function of risk management. The CDS is compared with insurance contracts, and a discussion of the 2014 International Swaps and Derivatives Association Credit Derivative Definitions is incorporated. For legal comparison, the South African model is compared with Canadian law and its unfunded credit derivatives in the light of recent regulation, and compared to German law and its prevalence of funded credit derivatives. Finally, suggestions are made as to the future of synthetic securitisation schemes. Thesis (LLD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016. Mercantile LawLLDUnrestricte...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{distributed}} computing systems, including Grids and Compute Utilities, and now Clouds, becomes a consideration for businesses hoping to manage start-up costs and times, {{as well as}} reduce the physical and environmental footprint of infrastructures. Instead of purchasing and maintaining hardware and software, organisations and individuals {{can take advantage of}} pay-per- use (utility) models that relate directly to their requirements of infrastructures, platforms and software. However, such metered services are not widely adopted yet {{due to the lack of}} assurance of Quality of Service (QoS). It is suggested that such systems will only attain greater acceptance by a larger audience of commercial consumers if binding Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are provided that encompass service descriptions, costs of provision and, importantly, assurances on availability, performance, and liability. Prediction, quantification of risk, and consideration of liability in case of underperformance are considered essential for the future provision of Computer (Cloud) Economics - in particular, for the provision of SLAs through resource brokers, and generally to be more comparable to financial markets. The principal focus of this thesis is on building brokerage and related services for supporting growth of Cloud and contributing to future computational economics. A brokerage should provide negotiation mechanisms between consumers and providers, and perhaps manage available computer resources, to realise the goals of both parties. SLAs are key to this, where each SLA details price, risk, performance and QoS parameters, amongst others. This thesis presents a novel approach that supports the creation and management of Service Level Agreements, aimed towards improved uptake of cornmoditised computational infrastructures, platforms and software services. By analysing issues within current SLAs, it summarises necessary characteristics to be addressed in Cloud SLAs. Inspired by financial portfolio analysis and in particular by credit derivatives, this work demonstrates how the proposed Cloud Collateralised SLA Obligations (CSO), analogous to <b>synthetic</b> <b>collateralised</b> debt <b>obligations</b> (CDO), can be used to mitigate risk of failure or underperformance through diversification of compute resource portfolios. The CSO prices risk integrates into service insurance, and builds in penalties, and in contrast to well-known Cloud price models, relates variable performance to variable price. This performance-price relationship would also be necessary for the appropriate use of other financial models. Through Value-at-Risk (VaR) style analysis, the probability of failure (risk of underperformance) can be related to a confidence level for each SLA offer - the confidence of meeting the SLA. The thesis further identifies how performance tranches support an autonomic aspect in attempting to ensure satisfaction of higher-value SLAs as a trade off against higher-risk, lower-value SLAs. The approach can readily integrate with any SLA framework that supports real- time dynamic characteristics. Outcomes are broadly relevant to Cloud Computing, and more specifically to Infrastructure as a Service Clouds. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Due to the large size of typical PO instances, global solving is not possible, instead we embed and solve sub-instances. The high quality of our approximate solutions can be assessed by comparison with a tight lower bound on the cost. Together with detection of BIBDs, symmetry breaking, extended reuse of already solved instances, and existence-checking during search, the performance of the program becomes good enough for constructing optimal portfolios of CDOs squared, with sizes common in the credit derivatives market, within minutes or seconds...|$|R

5000|$|In finance, a {{derivative}} is {{a contract that}} derives its value from the performance of an underlying entity.

Most derivatives are traded over-the-counter (off-exchange) or on an exchange such as the Bombay Stock Exchange, while most insurance contracts have developed into a separate industry.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} how new credit risk transfer vehicles have {{made it easier to}} reallocate large amounts of credit risk from the financial sector to the non-financial sector of the capital markets. In this article, we describe one of these new credit risk transfer vehicles, the collateralized debt <b>obligation.</b> <b>Synthetic</b> credit debt <b>obligations</b> utilize credit default swaps, another relatively new credit risk transfer vehicle. Financial institutions face five major risks: credit, interest rate, price, currency, and liquidity. The development of the derivatives markets prior to 1990 provided financial institutions with efficient vehicles for the transfer of interest rate, price, and currency risks, as well as enhancing the liquidity of the underlying assets. However, it is only in recent years that the market for the efficient transfer of credit risk has developed. Credit risk is the risk that a debt instrument will decline in value {{as a result of the}} borrower's inability (real or perceived) to satisfy the contractual terms of its borrowing arrangement. In the case of corporate debt obligations, credit risk encompasses default, credit spread, and rating downgrade risks. The most obvious way for a financial institution to transfer the credit risk of a loan it has originated is to sell it to another party. Loan covenants typically require that the obligor be informed of the sale. The drawback of a sale in the case of corporate loans is the potential impairment of the originating financial institution's relationship with the obligor of the loan sold. Syndicated loans overcome the drawback of an outright sale because banks in the syndicate may sell their loan shares in the secondary market. The sale may be through an assignment or through participation. While the former mechanism for a syndicated loan requires the approval of the obligor, the latter does not since the payments are merely passed through to the purchaser and therefore the obligor need not know about the sale. Another form of credit risk transfer (CRT) vehicle developed in the 1980 s is securitization [Fabozzi and Kothari (2007) ]. In a securitization, a financial institution that originates loans pools them and sells them to a special purpose entity (SPE). The SPE obtains funds to acquire the pool of loans by issuing securities. Payment of interest and principal on the securities issued by the SPE is obtained from the cash flow of the pool of loans. While the financial institution employing securitization retains some of the credit risk associated with the pool of loans, the majority of the credit risk is transferred to the holders of the securities issued by the SPE. Two recent developments for transferring credit risk are credit derivatives and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). For financial institutions, credit derivatives allow the transfer of credit risk to another party without the sale of the loan. A CDO is an application of the securitization technology. With the development of the credit derivatives market, CDOs can be created without the actual sale of a pool of loans to an SPE using credit derivatives. CDOs created using credit derivatives are referred to as synthetic CDOs. In this article, we discuss CDOs. We begin with the basics of CDOs and then discuss synthetic CDOs. The issues for regulators and supervisors of capital markets with respect to CDOs, as well as credit derivatives, are also discussed.

40|$|On April 16, 2010 the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a civil {{complaint}} against Goldman Sachs in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleged that Goldman violated the anti-fraud {{provisions of the}} federal securities laws, {{in connection with a}} 2007 <b>synthetic</b> collateralized debt <b>obligation</b> (CDO) transaction, ABACUS 2007 -AC 1 SPV (ABACUS). Goldman agreed a $ 500 million settlement with the SEC on July 15, 2010. We analyze the ABACUS transaction and the SEC's {{complaint against}} Goldman Sachs in the context of recent technological changes within the investment banking market. Investment banking was historically a relationship-based business, sustained by reputationally intermediated tacit contracts. Recent advances in information technology and financial economics have codified many formerly tacit elements of investment banking. As a result, some investment banking deals are now transacted at arm's length, and rely more upon formal contracts; we argue that, for this type of deal, there is a stronger case for legal rules regulating the investment bank-counterparty relationship. However, some deals continue to be arbitrated by tacit rules and norms and, for these deals, legal rules are less appropriate, because it is very hard for a third party to ascertain tacit understandings made {{in the context of a}} long-lived relationship. An attempt to introduce legal rules into reputationally intermediated relationships may even impair the counterparties' ability to arrive at informal arrangements, and so to trade. The supervision of deals like ABACUS should therefore reflect the extent to which they are transactional or relational; we argue that in neither case is there justification for the application of legal rules or the gap-filling standard of fiduciary duties...|$|R
40|$|<b>Synthetic</b> collateralized debt <b>obligations,</b> or <b>synthetic</b> CDOs, {{are popular}} {{vehicles}} for trading the credit {{risk of a}} portfolio of assets. Following a brief summary {{of the development of}} the synthetic CDO market, I draw on recent innovations in modeling to present a pricing model for CDO tranches that does not require Monte Carlo simulation. I use the model to analyze the risk characteristics of the tranches of synthetic CDOs. The analysis shows that although the more junior CDO tranches [...] equity and mezzanine tranches [...] typically contain {{a small fraction of the}} notional amount of the CDO's reference portfolio, they bear a majority of the credit risk. One implication is that credit risk disclosures relying on notional amounts are especially inadequate for firms that invest in CDOs. I show how the equity and mezzanine tranches can be viewed as leveraged exposures to the underlying credit risk of the CDO's reference portfolio. Even though mezzanine tranches are typically rated investment-grade, the leverage they possess implies their risk (and expected return) can be many times that of an investment-grade corporate bond. The paper goes on to show how CDO tranches and other innovative credit products, such as single-tranche CDOs and first-to-default basket swaps, are sensitive to the correlation of defaults among the credits in the reference portfolio. Differences of opinion among market participants as to the correct default correlation can create trading opportunities. Finally, the paper shows how the dependence of CDO tranches on default correlation can also be characterized and measured as an exposure to the business cycle, or as "business cycle risk. " A mezzanine tranche, in particular, is highly sensitive to business cycle risk. Risk...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of Credit Default Swap (CDS) indices and corresponding credit risk transfer markets with high liquidity and narrow bid-ask spreads has created standard benchmarks for market credit risk and correlation against which portfolio credit risk models can be calibrated. Integrated risk management for correlation dependent credit derivatives, such as single-tranches of <b>synthetic</b> Collateralized Debt <b>Obligations</b> (CDOs), requires {{an approach that}} adequately reflects the joint default behaviour in the underlying credit portfolios. Another important feature for such applications is a flexible model architecture that incorporates the dynamic evolution of underlying credit spreads. In this article, we present a model that can be calibrated to quotes of CDS index-tranches in a statistically sound way and simultaneously has a dynamic architecture {{to provide for the}} joint evolution of distance-to-default measures. This is accomplished by replacing the normal distribution by Smoothly Truncated α-Stable (STS) distributions in the Black/Cox version of the Merton approach for portfolio credit risk. This is possible due to the favourable features of this distribution family, namely, consistent application in the Black/Scholes no-arbitrage framework and the preservation of linear correlation concepts. The calibration to spreads of CDS index tranches is accomplished by a genetic algorithm. Our distribution assumption reflects the observed leptokurtic and asymmetric properties of empirical asset returns since the STS distribution family is basically constructed from α-stable distributions. These exhibit desirable statistical properties such as domains of attraction and the application of the generalized central limit theorem. Moreover, STS distributions fulfill technical restrictions like finite (exponential) moments of arbitrary order. In comparison to the performance of the basic normal distribution model which lacks tail dependence effects, our empirical analysis suggests that our extension with a heavy-tailed and highly peaked distribution provides a better fit to tranche quotes for the iTraxx IG index. Since the underlying implicit modelling of the dynamic evolution of credit spreads leads to such results, this suggests that the proposed model is appropriate to price and hedge complex transactions that are based on correlation dependence. A further application might be integrated risk management activities in debt portfolios where concentration risk is dissolved by means of portfolio credit risk transfer instruments such as synthetic CDOs. ...|$|R
40|$|Three scandals have {{reshaped}} business regulation {{over the}} past thirty years: the securities fraud prosecution of Michael Milken in 1988, the Enron implosion of 2001, and the Goldman Sachs “ABACUS” enforcement action of 2010. The scandals have always been seen as unrelated. This Article highlights a previously unnoticed transactional affinity tying these scandals together—a deal structure known as the <b>synthetic</b> collateralized debt <b>obligation</b> involving {{the use of a}} special purpose entity (“SPE”). The SPE is a new and widely used form of corporate alter ego designed to undertake transactions for its creator’s accounting and regulatory benefit. The SPE remains mysterious and poorly understood despite its use in framing transactions involving trillions of dollars and its prominence in foundational scandals. The traditional corporate alter ego was a subsidiary or affiliate with equity control. The SPE eschews equity control in favor of control through preset instructions emanating from transactional documents. In theory, these instructions are complete or very close thereto, making SPEs a real-world manifestation of the “nexus of contracts” firm of economic and legal theory. In practice, however, formal designations of separateness do not always stand up under the strain of economic reality. When coupled with financial disaster, the use of an SPE alter ego can turn even a minor compliance problem into a scandal because of the mismatch between the traditional legal model of the firm and the SPE’s economic reality. The standard legal model looks to equity ownership to determine the boundaries of the firm: equity is inside the firm, while contract is outside. Regulatory regimes make inter-firm connections by tracking equity ownership. SPEs escape regulation by funneling inter-firm connections through contracts, rather than equity ownership. The integration of SPEs into regulatory systems requires a ground-up rethinking of traditional legal models of the firm. A theory is emerging, not from corporate law or financial economics, but from accounting principles. Accounting has responded to these scandals by abandoning the equity touchstone in favor of an analysis in which contractual allocations of risk, reward, and control operate as functional equivalents of equity ownership—an approach that redraws the boundaries of the firm. Unfortunately, corporate and securities law hold out no prospects for similar responsiveness. Accordingly, we await the next alter-ego-based innovation from Wall Street’s transaction engineers with an incomplete menu of defensive responses...|$|R
40|$|It is commonplace to link neoclassical {{economics}} to 18 th- or 19 th-century {{physics and}} its notion of equilibrium, of a pendulum once disturbed eventually coming to rest. Likewise, an economy subjected to an exogenous shock seeks equilibrium through the stabilizing market forces unleashed by the invisible hand. The metaphor {{can be applied}} to virtually every sphere of economics: from micro markets for fish that are traded spot, to macro markets for something called labor, and on to complex financial markets in <b>synthetic</b> collateralized debt <b>obligations</b> - CDOs. Guided by invisible hands, supplies balance demands and markets clear. Armed with metaphors from physics, the economist has no problem at all extending the analysis across international borders to traded commodities, to what are euphemistically called capital flows, and on to currencies themselves. Certainly there is a price, somewhere, somehow, that will balance supply and demand. The orthodox economist is sure that if we just get the government out of the way, the market will do the dirty work. The heterodox economist? Well, she is less sure. The market might not work. It needs a bit of coaxing. Imbalances can persist. Market forces can be rather impotent. The visible hand of government can hasten the move toward balance. Orthodox economists as well as most heterodox economists see the Global Financial Crisis as a consequence of domestic and global imbalances. The most common story blames the US Federal Reserve for excessive monetary ease that spurred borrowing, and the US fiscal and trade imbalances for a surplus of liquidity sloshing around global financial markets. Looking to the specific problems in Euroland, the imbalances are attributed to profligate Mediterraneans. The solution is to restore global balance, which requires some combination of higher exchange rates for the Chinese, reduction of US trade deficits, and Teutonic fiscal discipline in the United States, the UK, and Japan, {{as well as on the}} periphery of Europe. This paper takes an alternative view, following the sectoral balances approach of Wynne Godley, combined with the modern money theory (MMT) approach derived from the work of Innes, Knapp, Keynes, Lerner, and Minsky. The problem is not one of financial imbalance, but rather one of an imbalance of power. There is too much power in the hands of the financial sector, money managers, the predator state, and Europe 2 ̆ 019 s center. There is too much privatization and pursuit of the private purpose, and too little use of government to serve the public interest. In short, there is too much neoliberalism and too little democracy, transparency, and accountability of government...|$|R
