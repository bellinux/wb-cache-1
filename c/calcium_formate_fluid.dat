40|$|Microbially induced {{carbonate}} precipitation (MICP) {{applied in}} the construction industry poses several disadvantages such as ammonia release to the air and nitric acid production. An alternative MICP from <b>calcium</b> <b>formate</b> by Methylocystis parvus OBBP is presented here to overcome these disadvantages. To induce calcium carbonate precipitation, M. parvus was incubated at different <b>calcium</b> <b>formate</b> concentrations and starting culture densities. Up to 91. 4 % +/- 1. 6 % of the initial calcium was precipitated in the methane-amended cultures compared to 35. 1 % +/- 11. 9 % when methane was not added. Because the bacteria could only utilize methane for growth, higher culture densities and subsequently calcium removals were exhibited in the cultures when methane was added. A higher calcium carbonate precipitate yield was obtained when higher culture densities were used but not necessarily when more <b>calcium</b> <b>formate</b> was added. This was mainly due to salt inhibition of the bacterial activity at a high <b>calcium</b> <b>formate</b> concentration.

Although formate is an endogenous product of metabolism, high concentrations are associated with toxicity during meth-anol overdose. Methods: In this prospective clinical trial, 12 healthy women ingested <b>calcium</b> <b>formate</b> (1, 300 mg) three times a day for 14 days. Study evaluations included physical and ocular examination, extensive laboratory testing, serum <b>calcium</b> and <b>formate</b> levels, Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity, color vision, visual fi elds, visual evoked potential (VEP), and full-fi eld, pattern, and multifocal electroretinograms (MERG). Results: The mean baseline serum level of formate was 0. 572 ± 0. 06 mM. Peak serum levels and fi nal serum for-mate did not differ signifi cantly from baseline. The fi nal concentration was 0. 582 ± 0. 091 mM. Accumulation of serum formate did not occur. There was also no evidence of toxicity with <b>calcium</b> <b>formate</b> ingestion.

Secondary accumulations of 2 : I clays minerals are found in A. caesiocinera while oxides of manganese are associated with X. elegans. Coatings of goethite (iron oxides) are believed to form from biological activity associated with the presence of hyphae and rodlet structures on the flakes. Calcium oxalate crystallizes into several morphologies such as druse, hexagonal plates, and lenticular containing between 20 and 48 per cent calcium by weight. <b>Calcium</b> <b>formate</b> and iron oxide (goethite) occur together in the form of 'red' desert varnish.

Attempt to acceleration of hydration process of such cements by hardening accelerating admixtures (ACC) was made.

40|$|Methane is {{the most}} {{important}} organic greenhouse gas emitted to the atmosphere for its contribution to the global warming. The gas has a strong infrared absorbance (i. e., 25 times more efficiently than carbon dioxide) which makes it a more effective greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide although having a shorter lifetime in the atmosphere (~ 9 years). Driven by the anthropogenic emission due to the increase of global population and energy demand, methane emission is set to increase in the future. Several anthropogenic methane emission mitigation has been applied in various sectors (agriculture, energy, and waste). The use of a biochemical reactor can be an alternative to remediate methane emission at low concentration ( 5 μm compared to other materials tested, AAC was able to adsorb more bacteria which might explain for the higher methane removal observed. The total methane and carbon dioxide-carbon in the headspace was decreased for 65. 2 ± 10. 9 % when M. parvus in AAC was incubated for 100 hours. AAC was therefore selected for the carrier material for the subsequent methane bioremediation studies (Chapter 3 and 4) and M. parvus was selected as the MOB strains for MICP studies (Chapter 5 and 6). In Chapter 3, the methane removal capacity of mixed MOB culture in a biofilter setup using AAC as a highly porous carrier material was tested. Although it was found that M. parvus exhibited the highest methane removal capacity on AAC (Chapter 2), mixed MOB culture was the selected culture for the biofilter inoculation in this study. This was {{based on the fact that}} non-aseptic practice was preferred to keep the operating cost lower if the biofilter was to be applied to remove methane in places with high methane emission (atmospheric concentration < 1 % (v/v)). Batch experiment was performed to optimize MOB immobilization on the AAC specimens where optimum methane removal was obtained when calcium chloride was not added during bacterial inoculation step and 10 mm thick AAC specimens were used. The immobilized MOB could remove methane at low methane concentration (~ 1000 ppmv) in a biofilter setup for 127 days at an average Removal Efficiency (RE) of 28. 7 %. MOB also exhibited a higher abundance at the bottom of the filter, in proximity with the methane gas inlet where a high methane concentration was found. It was concluded here that a reasonably efficient and a more environmentally friendly methane biofilter performance can be obtained using AAC as the carrier material. Hence, the setup was used in a field test application (Chapter 4). The performance of MOB immobilized on AAC to remove methane from ruminants effluent gas was investigated in Chapter 4. A biofilter employed in Chapter 3 was used as the biofilter in this study. Two dairy cows were housed in respiration chambers for two days where the exhaust gas from the chambers was used as the biofilter feed. MOB consumed methane at an average RE of 17. 52 % and elimination capacity (EC) of 67. 3 g m- 3 d- 1. Several factors that might cause the lower RE and EC compared to the lab scale study (RE = 28. 7 %) in Chapter 3 are: (a) the lower methane concentration and (b) the presence of ammonia in the livestock effluent gas, (c) the higher gas flow rate into the biofilter, and (d) the lowering humidity level in the biofilter. By using AAC as carrier material, carbon dioxide in the effluent gas as well as the one from the methane oxidation by MOB were removed by the carbonation reaction with AAC. Thus, complete carbon sequestration from methane was obtained. Overall, in part 1 of this thesis (Chapter 2 to 4) it was concluded that a more environmentally friendly methane biofilter than the ones previously tested could be achieved when using ACC as the carrier material.

To induce calcium carbonate precipitation, M. parvus was incubated at different <b>calcium</b> <b>formate</b> concentrations and starting culture densities. Up to 91. 4 % ± 1. 6 % of the initial calcium was precipitated in the methane amended cultures compared to 35. 1 % ± 11. 9 % when methane was not added. Because the bacteria could only utilize methane for growth, higher culture densities and therefore calcium removals were exhibited in the cultures when methane was added. A higher calcium carbonate precipitate yield was obtained when higher culture densities were used but not necessarily when more <b>calcium</b> <b>formate</b> was added. This was mainly due to salt inhibition of the bacterial activity at a high <b>calcium</b> <b>formate</b> concentration. A maximum of 0. 67 ± 0. 03 CaCO 3 Ca(CHOOH) 2 - 1 (g/g) calcium carbonate precipitate yield was obtained when 109 cells mL- 1 and 5 g L- 1 of <b>calcium</b> <b>formate</b> were used. Compared to the current strategy employing biogenic urea degradation as the basis for MICP, the approach in this study presents significant improvements in terms of pollutant emission reduction if applied in the construction industry. The process was subsequently applied on building material as an alternative surface treatment (Chapter 6). The effectiveness of MICP from the formate oxidation by Methylocystis parvus as an alternative concrete surface treatment was investigated in Chapter 6. MICP was induced on AAC by immersing the material in 109 M. parvus cells mL- 1 containing 5 g L- 1 of <b>calcium</b> <b>formate.</b> A 2 days immersion of the material gave the highest weight increase of the specimen due to the calcium carbonate deposition. The deposition mainly occurred on the wall of the pores on the surface of the specimen. Due to this surface deposition, a significantly lower water absorption was observed in the bacterially treated specimens compared to the non-treated ones (i. e., up to 2. 92 ± 0. 91 kg m- 2). A concomitant atmospheric methane removal (152. 2 ± 40. 1 μg of CH 4 m- 2 h- 1) was also observed in the bacterially treated specimens. Overall, in part 2 of this thesis (Chapter 5 and 6) it was concluded that compared to the currently employed biogenic processes, the formate-based MICP by M. parvus offers a more environmentally friendly approach for the biotechnological application to protect concrete surface. The results obtained from part 1 and 2 in this thesis were subsequently positioned in their related biotechnology field and the outlook for the respective researches was presented in Chapter 7. The AAC-based methane biofilter had lower methane removal efficiency compared to the previously reported biofilters, although the other biofilters operated with higher Empty Bed Residence Time (EBRT) which might increase the overall methane conversion in the biofilter. The AAC-based methane biofilter, however, offers an advantage of carbon dioxide sequestration and this advantage is not found in the other biofilters. For the formate-oxidation based MICP by M. parvus, it was found that, on per cell basis, the optimum biomineralization rate obtained in Chapter 5 (i. e., at 5 g L- 1 <b>calcium</b> <b>formate</b> and 109 cells ml- 1) was still approximately three times lower than the maximum urea based biomineralization rate by B. pasteurii ATCC 6453. Moreover, unlike the urea-based MICP where a high urea / calcium source concentration could be employed, the influence of the formate-oxidation based MICP on the building material characteristics was smaller. Nevertheless, the resulting calcium carbonate deposition could effectively lowered water intrusion into the material. Based on the results obtained, several suggestions were made. To construct the biofilter like the “green façade” concept, MOB should be applied by brushing / spraying on existing building material with consecutive applications of nutrient applications to sustain the MOB growth on the building structure. For the MOB-based MICP, the application on natural stones to test the effectiveness of the process as the surface treatment for this type of material should be performed. Future studies should also look into the use of mixed culture MOB as it may lower the cost of this type of application...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} high {{performance}} computers (HPC) has allowed materials researchers to model large three-dimensional (3 D) nano-structures. These 3 D nano-structures and their associated macro-properties can be sufficiently complex such that researchers {{can benefit from}} immersive virtual environments (VEs) in their analysis and interpretation of HPC model results. Because immersive VEs such as a CAVE ™ are expensive and not as convenient to use, compared to the researcher’s desktop computer, development of desktop VE-simulators has become important for day-to-day routine analysis. Recently, desktop computer graphic cards have significantly improved and consequently encouraged the use of desktop VEsimulators when analyzing these 3 D structures and properties. Here we demonstrate how immersive VEs and VE desktop-simulators {{can be used to}} better understand the relationship between the nano-structure of <b>Calcium</b> <b>Formate</b> and macroscopic wave properties that propagate through this structure as a continuum. Polar covalent bond orientations are observed to align along stiffer directions where faster longitudinal wave speeds exist.

40|$|International audienceAmorphous calcium {{carbonate}} (ACC) {{is known to}} interact with proteins, for example in biogenic ACC, to form stable amorphous phases. The control of amorphous:crystalline and inorganic:organic ratios in inhalable {{calcium carbonate}} microparticles may enable particle properties to be adapted to suit the requirements of dry powders for pulmonary delivery by oral inhalation. For example, an amorphous phase can immobilise and stabilise polypeptides in their native structure and amorphous and crystalline phases have different mechanical properties. Therefore, inhalable composite microparticles made of inorganic (i. e. calcium carbonate and <b>calcium</b> <b>formate)</b> and organic (i. e. hyaluronan (HA)) amorphous and crystalline phases were investigated for peptide and protein pulmonary aerosol delivery. The crystalline:amorphous ratio and polymorphic form of the inorganic component was altered by changing the microparticle drying rate and by changing the ammonium carbonate and HA initial concentration. The bioactivity of the model peptide, salmon calcitonin (sCT), co-processed with alpha- 1 -antitrypsin (AAT), a model protein with peptidase inhibitor activity was maintained during processing and the microparticles had excellent aerodynamic properties, making them suitable for pulmonary aerosol delivery. The bioavailability of sCT after aerosol delivery as sCT and AAT-loaded composite microparticles to rats was 4 -times {{higher than that of}} sCT solution...|$|R
40|$|Concrete {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{construction}} materials. There are several methods available to improve its performance, with one of them being the use of high-early-strength admixtures (HESAs). Typical HESAs include calcium nitrate, calcium chloride, and <b>calcium</b> <b>formate</b> (CF). Industrial by-products, such as acetic acid and lime stone sludge (LSS), can be used together to produce calcium acetate (CA), which can subsequently be used as a cementitious HESA. In this study, calcium carbonate and LSS were mixed with cement in weight ratios of 1 [*]:[*] 1, 1 [*]:[*] 1. 5, and 1 [*]:[*] 2, and the properties of the as-produced CA were evaluated. CA and CF were mixed with cement in different weight ratios (0, 1, 2, and 3 [*]wt%) to obtain CA- and CF-mortars, respectively. The flow behavior, setting time, pH, and compressive strength of these mortars were evaluated, and their X-ray diffraction patterns were also analyzed. It was found that as the CF content in the CF-mortar increased, the initial strength of the mortar also increased. However, it impaired its long-term strength. On the other hand, when 1 % CA was mixed with cement, satisfactory early and long-term strengths were achieved. Thus, CA, which is obtained from industrial by-products, can be an effective HESA...|$|R
40|$|Aims: This study {{examined}} the setting time, compressive strength, and pH of white mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) mixed with various additives: Calcium chloride (CaCl 2), <b>calcium</b> <b>formate</b> (CaF), disodium hydrogen orthophosphate (Na 2 HPO 4). Materials and Methods: Group 1 (Control) was obtained by mixing MTA with distilled water. In Groups 2 and 3, MTA containing 10 % CaCl 2 and 20 % CaF, respectively, was mixed with distilled water. In Group 4, MTA was mixed with 15 % Na 2 HPO 4. Setting time, compressive strength, and pH of each group were examined. Statistical Analysis Used: Analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 14. A P-value < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Comparison of mean values was done using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc Games-Howell test. Results: The setting time of test groups were significantly shorter than that of control group (P < 0. 001). The compressive strengths of test groups were {{lower than that of}} control group (P < 0. 001). The pH value obtained for Groups 3 and 4 were higher than that of the control group (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: Study result showed that additives significantly reduced the setting time of MTA and also maintained the pH at a high value. However, there was not much improvement in the compressive strength of the material...|$|R

One hundred and ninety two (E 1) and twenty four (E 2) piglets weaned at 21 days, distributed in a randomized block design with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments (absence x presence of fumaric acid and absence x presence of acidifying product), six replications of eight and one pig per pen were used, respectively, for E 1 and E 2. In E 1, lasting 41 days, the treatments were: Control – No acidifying + 40 ppm of colistin sulfate; AF – Presence of fumaric acid and absence of acidifying product; MA – Presence of acidifying product and absence of fumaric acid and AF+MA: presence of fumaric acid and acidifying product. In E 2, lasting 14 days, Pré-Starter I diet was used and assessed the same treatments of E 1. There were no treatment effects (P>. 05) in performance, incidence of diarrhea, gastrointestinal pH and morphometry of the duodenum of piglets, however, the addition of organic acid blend reduced (P 0, 05) no desempenho, incidência de diarreia, pH gastrintestinal e morfometria do duodeno dos leitões, porem, a adição da mistura de acidificantes reduziu (P< 0, 05) o peso relativo do intestino grosso e a adição do ácido fumárico aumentou o peso relativo do pâncreas e reduziu (P< 0, 05) a altura de vilosidade do jejuno e a contagem de coliformes totais e Escherichia coli no ceco. A inclusão de ácido fumárico e da mistura de acidificantes nas dietas de leitões desmamados contendo antibiótico melhorador de desempenho não se justifica, contudo, o ácido fumárico exerce ação inibitória sobre a população de coliformes totais e de Escherichia col...|$|R
