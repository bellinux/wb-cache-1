50|$|The <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>{{oystercatcher}},</b> Canarian oystercatcher, or Canarian {{black oystercatcher}} (Haematopus meadewaldoi),was a shorebird endemic to Fuerteventura, Lanzarote, and their offshore islets (Islote de Lobos and the Chinijo Archipelago) in the Canary Islands, Spain.|$|E
50|$|Hockey (1982) {{showed that}} the <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>oystercatcher</b> was a full species {{distinct}} from the African oystercatcher Haematopus moquini, of which it was formerly considered a subspecies; these two were occasionally lumped as subspecies of the Eurasian oystercatcher. Though this bird was long known to naturalists, it was considered a mere local population of the African black oystercatcher until 1913 (Bannerman 1913).|$|E
50|$|One {{species of}} {{oystercatcher}} became extinct during the 20th century, the <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>oystercatcher.</b> Another species, the Chatham oystercatcher, which is endemic to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand, {{is listed as}} endangered by the IUCN, while both the African and Eurasian oystercatchers are considered near threatened. In the past there has been conflict with commercial shellfish farmers, but {{studies have found that}} the impact of oystercatchers is much smaller than that of shore crabs.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>oystercatcher</b> was {{of similar}} size as its relatives, the African and Eurasian oystercatchers, or about 40-45 cm (around 16.5 in); {{comparing}} with the non-migratory African species, it probably weighed between 600-800 grams in life, with females being slightly heavier. Its bill was some 70-80mm long in males and markedly longer (around 80mm) in females; the tarsus measured around 50 mm, and the wings were around 250-265mm long, with males possibly {{at the upper}} range of that size (Bannerman 1963).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>oystercatcher</b> was in all {{likelihood}} a bird of the rocky shore rather than sandy beaches; although {{it might have been}} driven from the latter as they were much more utilized by humans - which it tended to avoid (Bannerman 1963). What is known about its feeding habits indicates that had always been less commonly found in beach habitat. As with all oystercatchers, its diet consisted of small molluscs and crustaceans rather than oysters. Especially the limpets Patella candei, Patella piperata, and Patella cf. ulyssiponensis, as well as the African mussel Perna (perna) picta were favorite prey items (Hockey 1996).|$|E
50|$|Meade-Waldo {{was born}} in Hever Castle and educated at Eton College and Magdalene College, Cambridge University. He spent his life {{managing}} the family's country estate, Stonewall, in Kent. He conducted fieldwork and collected birds in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, the Canary Islands and Spain, the presumably-extinct <b>Canary</b> <b>Islands</b> <b>oystercatcher</b> Haematopus meadewaldoi being foremost among them. He was Vice-President of the BOU in 1923 and was {{an active member of}} the Zoological Society of London, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Society for the Protection of the Fauna of the Empire and the Society for the Establishment of Nature Reserves. He was also Justice of the Peace for Kent.|$|E
