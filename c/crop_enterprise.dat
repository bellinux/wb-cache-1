40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is the {{economic}} feasibility of drip irrigation adoption using capital budgeting and quadratic programming techniques. The capital budgeting techniques used in the study are net present value (NPV) and returns above specified costs (RASC). Modified <b>crop</b> <b>enterprise</b> budgets incorporating drip irrigation are developed based on data from Texas AgriLife Extension Service <b>crop</b> <b>enterprise</b> budgets and published literature focusing on costs and returns of drip irrigation. The quadratic programming technique considers risk and incorporates the modified <b>crop</b> <b>enterprise</b> budgets to estimate a cropping pattern that maximizes the net income above specified costs for the region. The RASC per acre for drip-irrigated crops ranged from $ 56. 34 to $ 1, 909. 03, while the RASC per acre for flood-irrigated crops ranged from $ 142. 51 to $ 1, 488. 12. Flood-irrigated onions, cotton, and sugarcane had higher RASCs per acre, while the RASCs were greater for drip-irrigated grapefruit and oranges. Evaluating the NPV of the crops resulted in similar results; only grapefruit and oranges were economically-feasible drip-irrigated crops. The baseline results identified levels of drip irrigation adoption ranging from 52, 000 acres to 64, 497 acres as levels of risk were varied. The level of water available at the reservoir suggested minimal impacts on the level of drip-irrigation adoption, but serious implications for the agriculture economy. Several sensitivity scenarios concentrated on the implications of yield response and water savings that result from the adoption of drip irrigation. The greatest amounts of drip-irrigated crops were present when the yield responses were 130 % of the flood-irrigated crops with a 20 % water savings. As the amount of water available was reduced, the amount of drip-irrigated crops ranged from 46, 111 acres to 59, 724 acres. Drip irrigation appears to be an economically-viable alternative in the LRGV due to the presence of drip-irrigated crops in the entire myriad of scenarios investigated in this research. If producers are only concerned with the bottom line as provided by the RASC analysis and no other variables such as water availability, risk, and crop rotations affecting the decision making process, only drip-irrigated grapefruit and oranges are economically competitive with conventional irrigation systems...|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} {{equilibrium}} acreage allocation decisions {{at the farm}} and regional levels under risk aversion, yield uncertainty, and endogenous crop prices is undertaken in a two-crop, two-region setting. The main insight is that a partial specialization in one crop at a regional level may be an equilibrium dominant strategy relative to the more diversified crop mix produced on farm. This {{is due to the}} trade-offs among the effects of the "natural hedge" based on the negative price-yield correlation on the probability distributions of crop revenues and whole-farm revenue risk reduction through <b>crop</b> <b>enterprise</b> diversification. Another finding is that equilibrium in which each region grows only one crop is unlikely unless there are comparative advantages in production (or marketing) across regions. Other circumstances under which complete regional specialization is possible include a high level of producer risk aversion along with limited benefits derived through <b>crop</b> <b>enterprise</b> diversification due to high correlation of farm-level yields for different crops, and a low crop price elasticity. This applies to situations in which one can identify growing regions that are possessed of two features. The first feature is that growing conditions are relatively homogenous and farm-level yield co-variability is higher within each region as compared with that across the regions. The second feature is that the sizes of the regions are large enough to have a substantial impact on output prices. land allocation, spatial yield dependence, supermodular order. ...|$|E
