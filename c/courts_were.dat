5|$|On January 29, 1913, Calvin Shelverton {{applied for}} a {{building}} permit to construct the Piedmont Park Apartments. The apartments were designed by Leila Ross Wilburn and were decidedly middle-class unlike {{some of the other}} developments in the area. The apartments remained middle-class up until about 1960, and residents included such prominent Atlantans as accounting company president T. C. Dunlap and lawyer J. B. Stewart. In 1913, seven clay <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> built where the 1895 Cotton States and International Exposition's Manufacturers and Liberal Arts Building once was. Eight more <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> added in 1914 to accommodate the overwhelming demand.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} {{refused to}} do anything about those servicemen who had been rejected by the courts prior to Denning's judgment, which provoked public outcry under the slogan 'Fit for Service, Fit for Pension'. The British Legion chose 73 cases and asked Denning to let the Legion present them while the <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> not sitting; Denning heard all 73 cases on 11 July 1946.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{system of}} county courts in England and Wales {{dates from the}} County Courts Act 1846, which {{received}} Royal Assent on 28 August 1846 and was brought into force on 15 March 1847. England and Wales (with {{the exception of the}} City of London, which was outside the scope of the Act) were divided into 60 circuits, with a total of 491 courts. Four of these circuits were wholly in Wales, as were 46 of these courts. A further seven <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> located in Monmouthshire (which had at the time an ambiguous status and was sometimes treated as being part of England) and these seven <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> part of a circuit for Monmouthshire and Herefordshire. One county court judge was appointed to each circuit, assisted by one or more registrars with some limited judicial powers, and would travel between the courts in his area as necessary, sitting in each court at least once a month. Few permanent <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> needed initially, given the infrequency of court hearings, and temporary accommodation such as a town hall would often be used where there was no existing courthouse for use.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in September 1864, Indianapolis was {{the site}} of the trials by a {{military}} commission of several men accused and convicted of treason. In a landmark civil liberty case that became known as Ex parte Milligan, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the convictions, On April 3, 1866, the Court ruled that the military trial was illegal because the civilian <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> open and functioning during the war. Following the Court's ruling, the men were released.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of Saxon {{settlement}} in the town includes some Saxon stonework in the parish church of St Peter and St Paul. A charter of King Ine of Wessex, from 706, witnessed by nine bishops including the Archbishop of Canterbury, records the granting of {{the area in which}} Shepton Mallet is now situated to Abbot Berwald of Glastonbury Abbey. According to some legends Indract of Glastonbury was buried in Shepton. The town was in the Whitstone Hundred, and the hundred <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> held at Cannard's Grave, a short distance to the south of the town.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 18th {{to the early}} 19th century, the {{building}} was also known {{by a number of}} names, including the Palazzo del Tribunale, the Palais de Justice and the Gran Corte della Valletta. By the mid-19th century the building was deemed too small, and the <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> gradually moved to Auberge d'Auvergne between 1840 and 1853. The Castellania was then abandoned, before being briefly converted into an exhibition centre, a tenant house and a school.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, the {{airfield}} {{was occupied by}} the Royal Air Force, who erected Nissen huts and cleared the area of obstacles as {{it was intended to}} use the area as an Emergency Landing Ground. Three pillboxes were erected around {{the airfield}}'s perimeter. Between March and June 1940 the airfield was used by No. 15 Elementary Flying Training School at RAF Redhill as a relief landing ground. Knotley Hall was again requisitioned for use as the officers' quarters, although the tennis <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> off-limits.|$|E
5|$|Radyr Lawn Tennis Club {{was founded}} in 1914 by 20 Radyr 'Gentlemen', helped by the Earl of Plymouth Estates.

Again {{with the help of}} Plymouth Estates, the club lifted the turf from all three grass courts and relaid it on its current site next to Christ Church on Heol Isaf.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{was no longer}} regarded as being adequate {{to function as a}} courthouse by 1840, during the Government of Sir Henry Bouverie, and that year the Civil <b>Courts</b> <b>were</b> moved to Auberge d'Auvergne. The courts of criminal jurisdiction and the office of the police were moved to the auberge in 1853. Court archives and documents of registrations of the Castellania were relocated for safekeeping in the auberge.|$|E

5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog survives {{in some areas}} of Sydney, such as the Brickpit at Sydney Olympic Park (the {{proposed}} site for the tennis courts for the 2000 Sydney Olympics). When the green and golden bell frog was found there, the tennis <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> built elsewhere, and the population has since been monitored. This frog has become an unofficial mascot for the Homebush Bay area. It has also been introduced to places in Sydney in its natural habitat, without much success.|$|E
5|$|Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, the United States circuit <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> {{composed}} of a stationary United States district court judge and any two Supreme Court justices riding circuit. If one judge or justice disagreed with the other two, the majority prevailed. If only one Supreme Court justice could attend (as was authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1793), and a division arose between the district judge and the Supreme Court justice, the practice was to hold the case over until the next term. If a one-to-one division persisted with a different circuit riding justice, {{the opinion of the}} previous circuit rider broke the tie. Following a brief intermezzo with the soon-repealed Midnight Judges Act of 1801 (which briefly abolished circuit riding), under the Judiciary Act of 1802, the circuit <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> {{composed of}} a stationary district judge and one Supreme Court justice assigned to the circuit. But, a single judge (either the district judge or the circuit rider) could preside alone. In cases where both judges sat, though, one-to-one divisions {{were less likely to be}} resolved by continuing the case until the next term because the circuit riding justice would be the same (barring a change in membership on the Court).|$|E
5|$|A {{young girl}} was found raped and murdered, and Max Stuart, an Aborigine, {{was convicted and}} sentenced to be {{executed}} only a month later, {{on the basis of a}} confession gained during interrogation, although he had protested his innocence in pidgin English. Stuart's lawyer claimed that the confession was forced, and appeals to the Supreme and High <b>Courts</b> <b>were</b> dismissed. A linguist who investigated the case thought that the style of English in the confession was inconsistent with Stuart's background and speech. This aroused disquiet and objections against the fairness of the trial among an increasing number of legal academics and judges, and The News brought much attention to Stuart's plight with an aggressive, tabloid-style campaign. Soon, the case attracted international attention, some on the assumption that the legal system was racist. The former High Court Justice Sir John Latham also spoke out.|$|E

The exception, which often causes confusion to newer players, is that the doubles court has a shorter serve-length dimension.|$|R
5|$|After {{learning}} of the arrest of former governor Charles S. Morehead by federal authorities, Helm fled to Bowling Green, fearing his own arrest. Through the intervention of Warner Underwood {{he was able to}} return home on the condition that he swear an oath of allegiance to the Constitution. Nevertheless, federal soldiers repeatedly entered his home, encouraging his slaves to abandon him, and consuming or destroying his crops. Because the state's <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> closed on account of the war, he was unable to earn a living by practicing law. In short order his once-substantial fortune was expended, and he resorted to borrowing money to support his family.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{nominated}} 41 lower {{federal court}} judges {{in addition to}} his four Supreme Court justices. These included two judges to the United States circuit courts, nine judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 30 judges to the United States district courts. Because Cleveland served terms both before and after Congress eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the Courts of Appeals, he is one of only two presidents to have appointed judges to both bodies. The other, Benjamin Harrison, was in office {{at the time that the}} change was made. Thus, all of Cleveland's appointments to the circuit <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> made in his first term, and all of his appointments to the Courts of Appeals were made in his second.|$|E
5|$|Discussed in ArticleVIII, the {{judiciary}} {{was separated from}} the two other branches of the government, and was to be served by elective judges. Courts of first instance existed in each voivodeship and were in constant session, with judges elected by the regional sejmik assemblies. Appellate tribunals were established for the provinces, based on the reformed Crown Tribunal and Lithuanian Tribunal. The Sejm elected from its deputies the judges for the Sejm court, a precursor to the modern State Tribunal of Poland. Referendary <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> established in each province to hear the cases of the peasantry. Municipal courts, described in the law on towns, complemented this system.|$|E
