500|$|However, Biden {{did not see}} a rise in his {{poll numbers}} {{immediately}} after the Hart withdrawal, and was particularly stagnant in polls for the Iowa caucuses. [...] Nevertheless, Biden had confidence that he could prevail; {{on the eve of}} his announcement, he said: [...] "I'm going to win this thing. I really am. I just know it, I <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> in my fingertips." [...] Some political professionals saw Biden as believing that he could simply will himself to win the race, but his continued ability to raise campaign funds gave him credibility as a candidate.|$|E
500|$|Pilou Asbæk, who {{was cast}} to play Euron Greyjoy, spoke in an {{interview}} about the filming of the Kingsmoot saying [...] "We spent two days on the Kingsmoot itself, and then two days on the montage. We shot it chronologically, which helped. The water was freezing cold. We shot the drowning many, many times. I remember looking down the shore, after I {{had been there for}} five or six hours, and I saw two smiling faces, in the form of Gemma Whelan and Alfie Allen. They were just smiling their asses off, because they weren't cold! They just had to run to the boat." [...] In regards to stunts, Asbæk continued, [...] "I {{got a little bit of}} help, but not much. I think 95 percent of it was me. I like to do all of it when I can, because then I <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> with the character." ...|$|E
500|$|Debbi Peterson {{explained}} {{in an interview}} with MTV UK in 1989 about why Prince gave them the song: [...] " [...] really liked our first album. He liked the song 'Hero Takes a Fall', which is a great compliment, because we liked his music. He contacted us, and said, 'I've got a couple of songs for you. I'd like to know if you're interested,' and of course we were. One of the songs Prince brought to the group was 'Manic Monday', written under the pseudonym of Christopher." [...] Peterson talked about the evolution of what Prince brought them: [...] "It was a Banglefication of a Prince arrangement. He had a demo, that was very specifically him. It was a good song, but we didn't record it like 'This is our first hit single! Oh my God! I <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> in my veins!' We just did the song, and the album, and then sat back and thought about it." ...|$|E

500|$|Maria Amélia and her mother, who had {{accompanied}} her, disembarked on 31 August in Funchal, {{the capital of}} Madeira. The entire town greeted her joyfully, and a crowd followed the princess to her new home. She adored the island and told her mother: [...] "If I one day recover my previous robust health, isn't that so mommy, we will stay {{a long time in}} this island. We will make long excursions in the mountains, we will find new paths, just as we did in Stein!" [...] But her health worsened, {{and by the end of}} November, all hope was gone. By the beginning of 1853, the princess was bedridden, and she knew death was approaching: [...] "My strength diminishes from day to day; I <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it...</b> we are reaching the beginning of the end." [...] A little after midnight in the early hours of 4 February, a priest administered the last rites. Maria Amélia tried to comfort her mother: [...] "Do not cry... let God's will be done; may He come to my aid in my last hour; may He console my poor mother!" [...] She died later that morning at around 04:00.|$|E
2500|$|Perkins {{learned more}} about the guitar from John Westbrook, an African-American field worker in his sixties. [...] "Uncle John", as Perkins called him, played blues and gospel music on an old {{acoustic}} guitar. Westbrook advised Perkins to [...] "Get down close to it. You <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> travel down the strangs, come through your head and down to your soul where you live. You <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it.</b> Let it vib-a-rate." [...] Perkins could not afford new strings, and when they broke he had to retie them. The knots cut his fingers when he would slide to another note, so he began bending the notes, stumbling onto a type of blue note.|$|E
2500|$|... "Sullivan ... {{was very}} much in touch with all the music of his time.... There are bits which are {{definitely}} Wagnerian: the use of dotted rhythms, always in 4/4 time – you get the whiff of Meistersinger or Lohengrin, I think. There is, also, for example, a remarkable duet at the end of act 2, I would say Verdian in its sweep. [...] There are, of course, the stand-up arias, never a full ensemble until right at the end. [...] Rebecca's aria is a very interesting piece. [...] Whenever she is singing he uses the cor anglais to stress the sort of Eastern quality, and Sullivan claimed that this theme was one he had heard as a student in Leipzig, when he had attended a service at the Synagogue there. You can tell, and he quickly establishes it in the music, that he was not writing an operetta! [...] Look at this, very early on, some virtuoso stuff. [...] It needs a really accomplished orchestra. [...] He had always been cramped by the small orchestra, only ever one oboe, that he had to make do with at the Savoy. [...] Here he was really able to expand, you <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> <b>it</b> in the music." ...|$|E
