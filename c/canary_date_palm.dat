50|$|While P. dactylifera {{is grown}} for its edible <b>dates,</b> the <b>Canary</b> Island <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> (P. canariensis) and pygmy <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> (P. roebelenii) are widely grown as {{ornamental}} plants, but their dates {{are used as}} food for livestock and poultry. The <b>Canary</b> Island <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> differs from the <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> in having a stouter trunk, more leaves to the crown, more closely spaced leaflets, and deep green rather than grey-green leaves. The fruit of P. canariensis is edible, but rarely eaten by humans because of their small size and thin flesh.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Canary</b> Island <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> is {{typically}} cultivated in subtropical climates, particularly in subtropical Mediterranean climates, {{but also in}} wet-summer or humid subtropical climates like eastern Australia and the southeastern United States. There are even several instances of cultivated <b>Canary</b> Island <b>Date</b> <b>Palms</b> in high-latitude oceanic climates, such as Ireland, the UK, and the Channel Islands. It can be cultivated where temperatures rarely fall below -10 or -12 C for extended periods, although it will require some protection if cold periods are longer than normal. It is a slowly growing tree, exclusively propagated by seed.|$|R

50|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} to almost exclusively attack the Canary Island palm, but is seen on other species. Since 2009, Texas Phoenix palm disease is known to severely affect the Phoenix spp. and Sabal spp. <b>palm</b> trees: <b>Canary</b> Island <b>date</b> <b>palm,</b> silver or sylvester <b>date</b> <b>palm,</b> Queen palm, Sabal palm, and cabbage palm. All of these trees have been observed {{to have the same}} symptoms. The complete host range of this phytoplasma strain is not known.|$|R
5000|$|Phoenix canariensis is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the palm family Arecaceae, native to the Canary Islands. It is a relative of Phoenix dactylifera, the true <b>date</b> <b>palm.</b> It is the natural symbol of the Canary Islands, together with the canary Serinus canaria. [...] Mature P. canariensis are often used in the ornamental landscape and are collected and transplanted to their new planting location. A <b>Canary</b> Island <b>Date</b> <b>Palm</b> with 30 feet of trunk is approximately 60 years of age.|$|R
40|$|Island <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> is {{primarily}} observed on Phoenix canariensis (<b>Canary</b> Island <b>date</b> <b>palm).</b> • The disease {{is caused by}} the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. canariensis. • The leaf symptoms include a one-sided death, wherein the leaflets on only one side of the rachis are desiccated or dead. This is often accompanied by a reddish-brown or dark-brown streak on the petiole and rachis on the same side as the desiccated or dead leaflets. Eventually, the entire leaf dies. • The disease symptoms normally appear first on the oldest (lowest) living leaves, and then progressively move upward in the canopy until the palm is killed. • The only other disease that these symptoms could be confused with is petiole/rachis blight. • Transmission of the fungus from palm to palm {{is primarily}} by contaminated pruning tools. • There is no cure for this lethal disease. Fungicides have not been effective against Fusarium wilt. • Since there is no cure, disease management is aimed at disease prevention. A new hand saw or a disinfected pruning tool should be used for pruning leaves from each individual <b>Canary</b> Island <b>date</b> <b>palm...</b>|$|R
50|$|Elements of {{the former}} house garden, and estate {{landscaping}} remain today. These include {{the outline of the}} formal carriage loop north of the house, isolated elements such as mature trees and an avenue of rainforest tree species and palms going north from the house towards the river. More detailed elements such as a pedestal and urn, east of the house on the edge {{of the former}} carriage loop also remain. Tree plantings lining the former carriage loop north of the house include <b>Canary</b> Island <b>date</b> <b>palms</b> (Phoenix canariensis), southern nettle trees (Celtis australis) and cotton palms (Washingtonia robusta) with their tall, clean trunks to 20m high. An avenue of trees towards the river comprises Bunya Bunya pines (Araucaria bidwillii), hoop pines (Araucaria cunninghamii), Moreton Bay figs (Ficus macrophylla), <b>Canary</b> Island <b>date</b> <b>palms</b> and swamp mahoganies (Eucalyptus robusta). The latter of these may be later plantings. Walkway planting dates to the 1860s-1900, the main period of popularisation and fashionability of these species, and their promotion by such public figures as then Directors of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, Charles Moore and Joseph Maiden. These men provided such species to many public institutions such as hospitals. Cotton and <b>Canary</b> Island <b>date</b> <b>palms</b> were also commonly promoted species in this period. Close to Holker Street and the main entry are large specimens of Hill's fig (Ficus hillii) and Moreton Bay figs, transplanted from estate remnants to the east of the current entry driveway as part of a redevelopment of the main entry. These trees are at least of 1880s vintage but possibly older. Significance trees throughout the site include the extremely rare Schotia afra (Kaffir bean, Boer bean) and the surviving turpentines (Syncarpia glomulifera) which are likely to be indigenous to the site.|$|R
40|$|Graphiola {{leaf spot}} is a fungal leaf disease caused by Graphiola phoenicis. The disease is often {{referred}} to as “false smut. ” • The primary hosts in Florida are Phoenix species, especially Phoenix canariensis (<b>Canary</b> Island <b>date</b> <b>palm)</b> and Phoenix dactylifera (<b>date</b> <b>palm).</b> • The disease is easily diagnosed by direct examination of the affected leaf tissue. Very small (1 / 16 inch), black, cup-shaped fungal bodies (sori) are present on the leaf blade of the oldest leaves (lowest leaves in the canopy). They can be easily observed without any magnification. • The two primary <b>date</b> <b>palm</b> cultivars planted i...|$|R
50|$|The {{palmetto}} weevil (Rhynchophorus cruentatus) is {{an insect}} native to Florida, {{but has been}} found as far as southern Texas {{to the west and}} South Carolina to the north. It is the largest weevil in North America and the only kind of palm weevil in the continental United States. It infests palms and is considered a pest. Its main target is the <b>Canary</b> Island <b>date</b> <b>palm,</b> but <b>date</b> <b>palms</b> (a different species than the <b>Canary</b> Island <b>date</b> <b>palm),</b> sabal palms (the palmetto weevil's traditional target), saw palmetto (the palmetto weevil's traditional alternative target), Washingtonia, Pritchardia, royal palms, Latania, coconut palms, Caryota, and Bismarckia are also susceptible. Distressed palm trees are usually attacked, which makes transplanted trees a frequent target. The Palmetto Weevils mate {{at the base of the}} palm branches where the females deposit their eggs. The grubs then eat into the palm tree, killing it. After the larvae have turned into adult weevils, the damage can be seen, but by then, it is considered to be too late for the tree. The life cycle from egg to adult for a palmetto weevil is about 84 days. For prevention, it is recommended an appropriate insecticidal crown drench is done twice a year for high value palms.|$|R

50|$|The Fremantle Police Station complex (incorporating the 1899 {{limestone}} former courthouse) is a {{group of}} buildings located at 45 Henderson Street, Fremantle, Western Australia. The complex includes the former courthouse, police station, various accommodation buildings, artillery drill hall (now the Fly by Night Club) and lock-up. The group was originally constructed between 1896 and 1903. Later elements of lesser significance include the 1957 and 1978 extensions to the courthouse, the lock-up keeper's house, Norfolk Island pines and <b>Canary</b> Island <b>date</b> <b>palms.</b>|$|R
