50|$|Adolf Hitler's rise {{to power}} in Germany {{increased}} Soviet fears, and made the Baltic position between these two giants difficult. The Germans responded to the banking crisis of 1931 by introducing the policy of Grossraum wirtschaft. It was a <b>clearing</b> <b>agreement</b> where states exchanged material goods instead of money. This increased German trade with the Baltic states and it integrated their economy with Germany, but it never dominated their trade as effectively as in the Balkans. In January 1934, the Germans and the Poles signed a non-aggression pact.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} the bilateral <b>clearing</b> <b>agreement</b> following the separation of Czechoslovakia. The value of the Czech and Slovak <b>Clearing</b> <b>Agreement</b> (CSCA) depended on its ability to relieve pressure on convertible currency reserves and preserve inter-republic trade. The assessment is made by measuring the trend in the Czech and Slovak cases and comparing these results to instances without a bilateral arrangement. The CSCA experience reveals that a more widespread use of bilateral clearing arrangements by other transition economies might have provided little in terms of stability to convertible currency reserves. However, the evidence indicates a more positive effect on inter-republic trade than that attained under a number of non-bilateral scenarios. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis has been to analyse the {{managing}} of risks, insecurities and transactions costs that deterred economic exchange during the 1930 ’s and the 1940 ’s, within the Swedish-German bilateral clearing system, from a Swedish contractual theoretical perspective. In this thesis {{it has been shown}} that the <b>clearing</b> <b>agreement</b> was put in practice in 1934, on initiative of Sweden. In the agreement financial issues associated with risks and insecurities were to be reduced by formalising rules for the economic exchange. The basic principle was that Germany regularly had a trade surplus in relation to Sweden. The surplus was used for re-building the Reichsbank’s monetary reserves, as well as payments on financial claims. The agreement was designed in an incomplete way, to be adjusted ad hoc in a trial and error process. As both parties had different interests, they had to make concessions in order to sustain the clearing system. This was also reflected in the design of the agreement, which evolved from an incomplete to a specific, detailed agreement, due to the increasing risks and insecurities that had to be dealt with. The clearing system was ideal for wartime conditions since it maintained trade flows. It also became a line of defence: specific agreements allowed the dominant Germany less scope to assert preferential rights of interpretation of the rules and regulations. When the war intensified it was difficult for Germany to carry out its commitments to Sweden, and the Swedish party found reasons to distrust the German economy, which was entering a recession. At the same time Allied forces strengthened their political influence, and the victors would become the leaders of the future international economy. Sweden made a gradual exit from the clearing system, delivering the agreed upon exports to Germany, while keeping the Allied negotiators informed of the process. The Swedish-German clearing system collapsed in spring 1945...|$|E

The first two sections provide {{a detailed account}} of the institutional and economic framework in which these measures were enforced and interpret them utilizing statistical data. In the third section it suggests a theoretical interpretation of exchange control and <b>clearing</b> <b>agreements</b> stressing that these policies were a serious interference in market mechanisms. A further point is that exchange control introduced and practiced in Italy and Bulgaria was an eloquent example of how serious the balance of payments constraint was at that time and how difficult it was to circumvent it. In the last section it derives some lessons for today’s Italian and Bulgarian economies. Exchange control, <b>Clearing</b> <b>agreements,</b> International monetary relations...|$|R
