40|$|Abstract:- The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} {{the implementation of a}} nonparametric <b>curve</b> <b>generator</b> algorithm in FPGA as a test of concept for H/W acceleration solutions. It is shown that coordinate sequences as a curve representation when generated by the algorithm form a nonuniform sampled cosine/sine sequences of values {{that can be used in}} signal generation applications. A known draw back of the algorithm is the phase non uniformity of the samples. The paper presents solutions to fix the non uniformity by sample time delay compensation. A time sequence compensated extension of the algorithm is presented for use in digital sine and cosine signal generation applications. The VHDL description of the extended algorithm as proposed was simulated and synthesized in a Xilinx family FPGA showing low gate count. Finally the paper explores a second extension of the algorithm for random value trigonometric function computation. The performance results are compared with recent known coordinate transform solutions implemented in FPGA using the CORDIC algorithm as reported in literature.

40|$|Abstract:- The paper {{presents}} the implementation and {{an analysis of}} the Jordan's nonparametric <b>curve</b> <b>generator</b> algorithm in H/W acceleration solutions like sine/cosine generation. It is shown that the x and y coordinate sequences generated by the algorithm as the curve representation are really approximated nonuniform sampled cosine/sine functions sequences of values with useful properties. The nonuniformity of the samples along the curve inherent to the algorithm is analyzed and acknowledged as a drawback in its use for signal generation purposes. An extension of the four points neighbor algorithm that keeps the x and y sequences separate is shown to have promising efficiency in sine/cosine digital signal generation applications. Possible solutions for the correction of the non uniformity problem for practical implementations are presented. A VHDL description of the algorithm was derived, simulated and synthesized in a FPGA with final target H/W acceleration applications.

30|$|To {{deal with}} the high {{dimensionality}} and computational density of the Optimal Power Flow model with Transient Stability Constraints (OTS), a credible criterion to determine transient stability is proposed based on swing <b>curves</b> of <b>generator</b> rotor and the characteristics of transient stability.

Therefore, when a parallel computing approach based on the MATLAB parallel toolbox is used to handle multi-contingency cases, the calculation speed is improved significantly.

40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} is {{proposed}} {{to solve the}} problem of monotone smoothing splines using general linear systems. This problem, also called monotone control theoretic splines, has been solved only when the <b>curve</b> <b>generator</b> is modeled by the second-order integrator, but not for other cases. The difficulty in the problem is that the monotonicity constraint should be satisfied over an interval which has the cardinality of the continuum. To solve this problem, we first formulate the problem as a semi-infinite quadratic programming problem, and then we adopt a discretization technique to obtain a finite-dimensional quadratic programming problem. It is shown that the solution of the finite-dimensional problem always satisfies the infinite-dimensional monotonicity constraint. It is also proved that the approximated solution converges to the exact solution as the discretization grid-size tends to zero. An example is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|E

We {{investigate}} the possible bounds {{which could be}} placed on alternative theories of gravity using gravitational wave detection from inspiralling compact binaries with the proposed LISA space interferometer. Specifically, we estimate lower bounds on the coupling parameter ω of scalar-tensor theories of the Brans-Dicke type and on the Compton wavelength of the graviton λg in hypothetical massive graviton theories. In these theories, modifications of the gravitational radiation damping formulae or of the propagation of the waves translate into {{a change in the}} phase evolution of the observed gravitational waveform.

Lower bounds on the graviton Compton wavelength ranging from 10 ^ 15 km to 5 * 10 ^ 16 km can be obtained from one-year observations of massive binary black hole inspirals at cosmological distances (3 Gpc), for masses ranging from 10 ^ 4 to 10 ^ 7 M_sun. For the highest-mass systems (10 ^ 7 M_sun), the bound is proportional to (LISA arm length) ^ 1 / 2 and to (LISA acceleration noise) ^- 1 / 2. For the others, the bound is independent of these parameters because of the dominance of white-dwarf confusion noise in the relevant part of the frequency spectrum. These bounds improve and extend earlier work which used analytic formulae for the noise curves. Comment: 16 pages, 9 figures, submitted to Classical & Quantum Gravit...|$|E

40|$|Stepping is a {{fundamental}} skill involved in common bipedal activities such as walking, foot repositioning and step recovery. Generating these stepping activities requires characters that are controllable and responsive. This dissertation describes a goal-directed controller and a momentum supervisor for characters that perform both believable and robust steps {{under a variety of}} conditions. The desired step is controlled by generic task goals, namely step position and step duration, which allow characters to step in arbitrary directions with various speeds. These high-level goals guide desired changes of a character's center of mass and swing foot over the duration of the step. To produce realistic and flexible steps, the desired time-varying values for the center of mass and the swing foot are derived from parametric <b>curve</b> <b>generators</b> which are built on empirical evidence extracted from motion capture data of stepping. Controlling these two values along with regulation of angular momentum in vertical axis produces characters with coordinated full-body movements including natural arm swings during stepping. The system can guide a character with purposeful, directable steps to precisely follow user-specified foot placements and to carefully control the character's position and orientation. Moreover, the same system can be used to create protective steps to maintain the character's balance in response to a perturbation. A novel supervisory routine automatically chooses when and where to step with a straightforward goal: removing all linear and angular momenta induced by a push. In contrast to previous methods for push recovery using the inverted pendulum, the proposed momentum supervisor introduces a nice clean formulation to determine when and where to step and provides better prediction of a character's stability under perturbations by considering both linear and angular momenta of the character. In addition to responding to a perturbation, this dissertation also presents an approach for characters that anticipate impending perturbations with examples taken from human motion capture data. I focus on the motion interpolation sysnthesis technique which allows a character to anticipate by blocking or dodging a threat coming from a variety of directions and targeting any part of the body...|$|R
