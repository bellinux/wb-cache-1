40|$|Phenotyping {{morphological}} {{traits of}} blueberry bushes {{in the field}} is important for selecting genotypes that are easily harvested by mechanical harvesters. Morphological data {{can also be used to}} assess the effects of crop treatments such as plant growth regulators, fertilizers, and environmental conditions. This paper investigates the feasibility and accuracy of an inexpensive unmanned aerial system in determining the morphological characteristics of blueberry bushes. Color images collected by a quadcopter are processed into three-dimensional point clouds via structure from motion algorithms. Bush height, extents, canopy area, and volume, in addition to crown diameter and width, are derived and referenced to ground truth. In an experimental farm, twenty-five bushes were imaged by a quadcopter. Height and width dimensions achieved a mean absolute error of 9. 85 cm before and 5. 82 cm after systematic under-estimation correction. Strong correlation was found between manual and image derived bush volumes and their traditional growth indices. Hedgerows of three Southern Highbush varieties were imaged at a commercial farm to extract five morphological features (base angle, blockiness, <b>crown</b> <b>percent</b> height, crown ratio, and vegetation ratio) associated with cultivation and machine harvestability. The bushes were found to be partially separable by multivariate analysis. The methodology developed from this study is not only valuable for plant breeders to screen genotypes with bush morphological traits that are suitable for machine harvest, but can also aid producers in crop management such as pruning and plot layout organization...|$|E
3000|$|The {{effect of}} fire {{intensity}} on the efficacy or the raking treatment was investigated using mixed effects logistic regression. Fire intensity {{is defined as}} “the energy released during various phases of the fire” (Keeley 2009), and crown scorch is a commonly used proxy for fire intensity (Van Wagner 1973, Williams et al. 1998, Twidwell et al. 2009). We used <b>percent</b> <b>crown</b> volume scorched instead of maximum crown scorch height or relative scorch height as our measure of fire intensity because it {{is viewed as a}} more accurate assessment of crown scorch (Peterson 1985, Twidwell et al. 2009). The effect of fire intensity on raking treatment efficacy was tested by including an interaction between raking and fire intensity category in a GLMM model. Low intensity was defined as trees with crowns that were not scorched (n = 172), moderate intensity was defined as trees with <b>percent</b> <b>crown</b> volume scorched between 1 % and 80 % (n = 181), and high intensity was defined as trees with a <b>percent</b> <b>crown</b> volume scorched > 80 % (n = 104).

Scorch and char heights were measured using an Impulse handheld laser rangefinder (Laser Technologies, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA), and <b>percent</b> <b>crown</b> volume scorch was visually estimated. Litter and duff consumption was measured by using a duff pin placed at the uphill side of the unraked trees {{at the top of}} the litter layer prior to fire, measuring from the top of the pin down to any unconsumed litter or duff or mineral soil following the fire. Duff pins were not installed for raked trees because all of the litter and duff at the base of the tree had been removed. The vigor of each tree and beetle activity were monitored for three summers following the fires. There were several areas within each burn unit that did not burn. Trees within these areas were excluded from the analysis, reducing the final sample sizes to 58, 153, and 246 trees in Cabin Creek, Redwood Canyon, and Wall Spring, respectively, for a total of 457 trees.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This study {{evaluated}} {{the use of}} radial growth averaging as a technique of identifying canopy disturbances in a thinned 55 -year-old mixed-oak stand in West Virginia. We used analysis of variance to determine the time interval (averaging period) and lag period (time between thinning and growth increase) that best captured the growth increase associated with different levels of crown release of Quercus prinus L. and Quercus rubra L. A lag of 3 years and an interval of 7 years yielded the best fit of percent growth change and <b>percent</b> <b>crown</b> release, respectively, for Q. prinus; for Q. rubra, the radial growth response {{did not differ significantly}} when lag and interval were varied from 1 to 3 and 6 to 15 years, respectively. The relationship between <b>percent</b> <b>crown</b> release and <b>percent</b> growth change was linear for both species. This method provides a suitable means of detecting canopy disturbances affecting overstory trees and is potentially applicable to other tree species. When combined with fire histories, these data can provide the basis for re-constructing long-term disturbance regimes. This estimate may also provide a framework for scheduling the rate of stand entry for silvicultural treatments (e. g., thinning) that is consistent with its historic stand development.

Two thousand seedlings were tagged on 56 sites in 1992 and monitored for six years. Initial data collected included seedling height, browsing history and <b>percent</b> <b>crown</b> closure. At {{the end of}} the growing season of the following six years, heights of these seedlings were remeasured; damages on seedlings were assessed according to browsing, physical, logging and unknown factors.

Three dates of ETM+ data were acquired to predict <b>percent</b> <b>crown</b> cover using a regression tree algorithm. Comparisons of training accuracies and field data to ETM+ tree estimates yielded root mean square errors (rmse) of fF 10 % crown cover. When aggregating the 30 -m map to 250 - and 500 -m MODIS cell sizes, the training errors are more than halved.

This fire provided an opportunity to study the postfire responses of red alder (Alnus rubra), black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) [P. balsamifera subsp. trichocarpa], and bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum) in the 3. 2 -ha scorched riparian zone. Bigleaf maple endures {{all but the most}} intense fires, resprouting vigorously after fire. Red alder and black cottonwood are known resprouters that may survive low intensity fires, but data about their responses to fire are sparse. The postfire status of every tree in the burn zone was evaluated immediately after the fire in June 1999, and during the first postfire growing season in May 2000. Tree response, in relation to trunk diameter, <b>percent</b> <b>crown</b> scorch, and <b>percent</b> bark scorch, was categorized as (1) alive with a new leafy crown; (2) topkilled and resprouted; or (3) dead. Fire intensity was higher on the left bank (left side of the creek when facing downstream), where trees experienced greater mortality. More than half the 854 trees in the burn zone survived the fire, 57 % by forming new leafy crowns and 43 % by resprouting. Red alder, black cottonwood and bigleaf maple demonstrated abilities to survive a disturbance to which they are not ordinarily subjected. All three species resisted low intensity fire and reformed leafy crowns on the right bank, and they endured moderate to high intensity fire by resprouting after topkill on the left bank. On the left bank, probabilities of surviving 100 % crown scorch were 0. 24 for red alder, 0. 66 for black cottonwood, and 0. 68 for bigleaf maple; probabilities of surviving 100 % bark scorch were 0. 09 for red alder, 0. 66 for black cottonwood, and 0. 60 for bigleaf maple.

We {{evaluated}} {{the utility of}} the composite burn index (CBI) for estimating fire severity in Alaskan black spruce forests by comparing data from 81 plots located in 2004 and 2005 fire events. We collected data to estimate the CBI and quantify <b>crown</b> damage, <b>percent</b> of trees standing after the fire, depth of the organic layer remaining after the fire, depth of burning in the surface organic layer (absolute and relative), and the substrate layer exposed by the fire. To estimate pre-fire organic layer depth, we collected data in 15 unburned stands to develop relationships between total organic layer depth and measures of the adventitious root depth above mineral soil and {{below the surface of the}} organic layer. We validated this algorithm using data collected in 17 burned stands where pre-fire organic layer depth had been measured. The average total CBI value in the black spruce stands was 2. 46, with most of the variation a result of differences in the CBI observed for the substrate layer. While a quadratic equation using the substrate component of CBI was a relatively strong predictor of mineral soil exposure as a result of fire (R 2 = 0. 61, P < 0. 0001, F = 60. 3), low correlations were found between the other measures of fire severity and the CBI (R 2 = 0. 00 – 0. 37).

40|$|In fire {{dependent}} forested ecosystems, fire {{managers are}} greatly interested {{in predicting the}} consequences of their management-oriented prescribed burnings on post-fire tree mortality. While fire intensity is believed to be a strong predictor of tree mortality, fire behavior itself largely depends on fuel characteristics, including both their structure and spatial distribution. We examined the type and distribution of fuels, their effects on fire behavior, and the effects of fire on tree mortality in slash pine forests in the Florida Keys. We conducted a burning experiment in six blocks, and burned eleven plots, three in winter and eight in summer, over a four-year period from 1998 to 2001. Post-fire slash pine mortality was investigated annually for one, two or three years in seven burn plots, three winter burn and four summer burn plots. We used linear regression to model the effects of fuel types on fire severity, and logistic regression to model the effects of burn season, fire severity and tree dimensions on tree mortality. Fire severity increased with surface fuel loads, but was negatively related to the quantity of hardwood shrub fuels. Tree mortality was significantly higher in summer burn than in winter burn plots, and was strongly related to tree size and <b>crown</b> scorch <b>percent.</b> This study suggests that pine tree mortality can be minimized by burning in winter.

The mixed conifer forest was dominated by Psuedotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir), Abies concolor (white fir), Pinus labertiana (sugar pine), and Libocedrus decurrens (incense cedar). Several Pinus jeffreyi (Jeffrey pine) and P. ponderosa (ponderosa pine) were also sampled. Trees were measured for crown length, height of crown scorch, live crown height, and bole scorch within several weeks of the fire in the fall 2001.

Specific categories included DBH classes from 25 to 50  cm, 51 to 76  cm, and ≥ 77  cm; crown kill ranges ≤ 10 %, 11 to 50 %, 51 to 60 %, 61 to 70 %, 71 to 80 %, 81 to 90 %, and 91 to 100 %; and cambium kill categorical ratings of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Any tree that survived at least one year post fire was monitored annually for five years or until death, then for 10  years post mortality. Only trees with 10  years of post-mortality observations were used in this analysis. One year post fire, we assessed tree and injury characteristics including species, DBH, tree height, pre-fire crown length, number of red turpentine beetle (RTB; Dendroctonus valens LeConte) pitch tubes for pines, and fire injury. We quantified fire injury by recording cambium kill rating (CKR; ordinal variable between 0 and 4 describing the number of dead cambium samples at each quadrant of the tree base), crown length killed (all species; observed portion of the crown with dead tissue from fire injury), and crown length scorched (Jeffrey pine and ponderosa pine only; observed portion of the crown with dead needles, but living buds and branches). Lengths were measured using a clinometer or laser hypsometer to the nearest 0.3  m. We calculated pre-fire crown length and crown length killed from the estimated pre-fire crown base height, post-fire crown base height, and tree height measurements. The pre-fire crown was estimated using the methods described in Ryan (1982), by visually reconstructing the crown to its pre-fire state based on crown scorch and fine branch structure. We converted crown length killed into <b>percent</b> <b>crown</b> length killed, by dividing the crown length killed by the pre-fire crown length to create a crown injury variable (CI). When crown length killed was not available, we used an estimated live crown measurement to determine <b>percent</b> <b>crown</b> length killed.

We therefore also assessed whether each snag was in a stand that had been salvage logged (Sal) and if the snag was surrounded by live conifers (protected by green conifers; PGC) as binary categories (0 [*]=[*]no and 1 [*]=[*]yes). Each year after this initial assessment, trees were monitored for live or dead status and break height, if applicable.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Nowadays dental {{implants}} {{are accepted}} as a successful replacement of conventional fixed and removable prosthesis which can restore esthetics in an ideal way. Because of visibility of anterior teeth while smiling and speaking, the importance of esthetics in these areas is very important. In this research, the provision rate of esthetic indexes of crowns supported with swiss- plus implants is assessed, also overall patient satisfaction is evaluated. Methods. The study was done on 21 patients who were treated with 30 implant supported crowns and the variables: clinical crown length, crown width, faciolingual dimention of crown, contact point position, soft tissue margin level and papilla index, crown color, abutment visibility and patient satisfaction range were assessed. Differences in variables between two groups were analyzed using the paired t- test. A wilcoxon signed rank test was used in analysis of differences in papilla index score. Results. The average amount indexes in implant-supported crowns and natural teeth in arrangement were: clinical crown length 10. 05 mm and 9. 35 mm, crown width 7. 36 mm and 7. 33 mm, faciolingual dimension 6. 67 mm and 7. 72 mm, mesial contact point position 36. 20 and 32. 86 percent, distal contact point position 50. 86 and 41. 76 percent, soft tissue margin level - 0. 64 mm and - 0. 15 mm, papilla index in mesial 2. 17 mm and 2. 60 mm, papilla index in distal 2. 10 mm and 2. 63 mm. color of 24 crowns were similar to natural teeth and in one case abutment was visible. 95. 2 percent of patients expressed satisfaction from esthetics of the <b>crowns</b> (60 <b>percent</b> complete satisfaction and 40 percent partial satisfaction). Discussion. In comparison to the natural teeth, The crowns 1 were longer 2 had smaller faciolingual width 3 had more apically soft tissue margin level 4 had lower scores of papilla index. No significant statistically differences were observed in mesiodistal width and contact point position between two groups. Key words.

40|$|Highlights - Prescribed burns can be feasibly {{conducted}} in stands {{as young as}} 12 years old. - Giant sequoia had exceptionally high survival; sugar pine had the lowest survival. - Pruning had minimal effects on survival. - Spring burns in young stands killed seven times as many trees as fall burns. Abstract High-severity wildfires increasingly influence forests in the western United States. Extensive research has identified preventative practices including mechanical and prescribed fire treatments to reduce wildfire severity in mature stands. Yet limited research has investigated fuel management treatments in young stands which can be particularly vulnerable to even low intensity fire. To address this gap, we investigated how prescribed fire ({{conducted in}} both the spring and fall) and pre-treatment fuel modifications impacted individual tree damage (or injury) and mortality in nine 13 – 14 year old mixed conifer stands in the central Sierra Nevada, California, USA. Prior to burning, randomly selected trees were pruned to 1. 8 m height above ground. Randomly selected trees were also raked to reduce surrounding surface fuel. Raking fuel from trees reduced the amount of crown volume scorched for all species, but not enough trees died to determine if raking influenced probability of survival. Pruning was associated with reductions in crown consumption height and <b>percent</b> <b>crown</b> volume consumed (5...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Tanoak (Lithocarpus densflorus (Hook and Am.) Rehd.), an {{evergreen}} {{hardwood tree}} that grows abundantly in southwest Oregon and north California, sprouts vigorously after a disturbance, such as logging or fire These sprouts form clumps that can hamper conifer regeneration on clearcuts and in shelterwoods. In {{order to obtain}} a quantitative measure of the site occupancy by tanoak sprout clumps, aboveground biomass and leaf area were estimated {{for a range of}} sprout clump sizes of age 1 to 6. Both variables were linearly correlated with the diameter of the original parent tree at breast height (dbh). Equations were developed for predicting sprout clutnpbiomass, leaf area, and crown area through age 6 from the dbh of the original parent tree. Thus, by knowing the diameters of tanoak trees prior to cutting, the bioinass, leaf area, and crown area of the developing sprout clump stand can be predicted up to 6 years after cutting. Biomass and leaf area were also linearly correlated with crown area. This permits the estimation of tanoak site occupancy (i. e., biomass/ha, leaf area index, and <b>percent</b> <b>crown</b> cover) in existing brushfields, based on measurements of clump size derived from aerial photos or ground surveys. Examples of the use of these methods are included...|$|R
40|$|Seedlings were thinned to {{spacings}} of 5, 9, 12, 15, and 18 {{feet and}} measured periodically. Twenty-seven years after treatment, quadratic mean diameters increased curvilinearity (p < or = 0. 05) as spacing increased, but total height {{did not differ}} significantly (p < or = 0. 05) with spacing. Corresponding basal areas decreased curvilinearly (p < or = 0. 05), and cubic volumes decreased linearly (p < or = 0. 05) as spacing increased. All periodic annual increments differed with period or age. Periodic annual increments for mean diameter and basal area varied curvilinearly (p < or = 0. 05), whereas volume increments varied linearly (p < or = 0. 05) with spacing for each period. Height increments were greatest at intermediate spacing during some periods, at wide spacings during other periods, and at the narrowest spacing during one period. Crown widths increased (p < or = 0. 05) as spacing widended. Fifty <b>percent</b> <b>crown</b> cover as attained at a stand density index of about 80 for all spacings.

30|$|Stands {{experiencing}} WSBW outbreak were sampled in 2013 using a randomized, systematic grid of ten 0.02 ha plots {{to record}} overstory tree data {{as a part}} of a larger study (Polinko 2014). Five 0.001 ha regeneration plots were nested inside each of the overstory plots to quantify regeneration; these were located at the plot center and 3.95 m from plot center in each cardinal direction. Measurements taken on all overstory trees (trees with diameter at breast height [DBH; 1.37 m] > 12.7 cm) included DBH, species, condition (live or dead), height, height to live <b>crown</b> base, and <b>percent</b> defoliation. Defoliation of live trees by WSBW was measured using techniques adapted from Millers et al. (1991; sketch method). Cumulative defoliation was sketched on a transparency using the guidelines of Schomaker et al. (2007) and later digitally scanned at 300 dots per inch. Pixels were counted using the analysis tools in Adobe® PhotoShop CS 5. The proportion of defoliated crown area to total crown area was recorded and used to estimate percent canopy defoliation. Although the measurements are presented as a continuous variable, the method only reduces bias between individual assessments and is still prone to bias, which may be large (Hollands and Dyre 2000). Aspect, elevation, and defoliation ratings were compared between stands using Wilcoxon sign rank test with significance determined at α ≤ 0.05.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: To address {{hazardous}} fuel accumulations, many fuel {{treatments are}} being implemented in dry forests, {{but there have}} been few opportunities to evaluate treatment efficacy in wildfires. We documented the effectiveness of thinning and prescribed burning in the 2006 Tripod Complex fires. Recent fuel treatments burned in the wildfires and offered an oppor-tunity to evaluate if two treatments (thin only and thin and prescribed burn) mitigated fire severity. Fire severity was mark-edly different between the two treatments. Over 57 % of trees survived in thin and prescribed burn (thinRx) units versus 19 % in thin only (thin) and 14 % in control units. Considering only large-diameter trees (> 20 cm diameter at breast height), 73 % survived in thinRx units versus 36 % and 29 % in thin and control units, respectively. Logistic regression modeling demonstrates significant reductions in the log-odds probability of tree death under both treatments with a much greater re-duction in thinRx units. Other severity measures, including <b>percent</b> <b>crown</b> scorch and burn severity index, are significantly lower in thinRx units than in thin and control units. This study provides strong quantitative evidence that thinning alone does not reduce wildfire severity but that thinning followed by prescribed burning is effective at mitigating wildfire se-verity in dry western forests.

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Knowledge about {{vegetation}} {{patterns and}} ecological processes in unmanaged, late-successional watersheds {{is needed to}} provide a foundation for forest management strategies aimed at conserving native biodiversity. I examined influences of environmental variability and disturbance history on forest structure and composition in the Cummins Creek Wilderness, located on the central Oregon coast. Climatic and topographic variables explained the majority of hillslope community composition, while fire history explained most of the variability in hillslope forest structure. Forest structure and composition in riparian areas was related to a climatic gradient as well as position in the stream network. The abundance of two fire-sensitive species, Tsuga heterophylla (western hemlock) and Picea sitchensis (Sitka spruce), decreased with distance from old-growth patches, possibly reflecting a seed dispersal gradient that occurred following fires 80 to 140 years ago. I developed predictive maps of understory conifer patterns using remote sensing, aerial photographs, digital elevation models and stream maps. I predicted P. sitchensis regeneration based on distance from the coast and topography, and T. heterophylla regeneration based on <b>crown</b> size, <b>percent</b> hardwood composition, topography, and distance from old-growth patches. Although I found statistically significant relationships between understory patterns and GIS predictor variables, the models explained only low to moderate amounts of the overall variability. Landscape-scale simulations of T. heterophylla showed that population expansion through gap-phase recruitment was limited by short seed dispersal distances in closed-canopy forests, the requirement for canopy gap disturbances to facilitate overstory recruitment, and the lag between recruitment and reproduction. Although fine-scale habitat features can influence the amount of regeneration in a gap when seed sources are present, the fire regime may ultimately control the abundance of T. heterophylla at the landscape scale through dispersal limitations. Brief increases in fire frequency can cause a sustained decrease {{in the amount of}} T. heterophylla on the landscape once fire frequency is reduced below a threshold value. Our results emphasize the complexity and diversity of forest vegetation at the watershed scale. Environmental variability, disturbance history, and dispersal limitations have all played a role in creating the current landscape patterns in the Cummins Creek Wilderness...|$|R
