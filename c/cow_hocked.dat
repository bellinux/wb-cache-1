5000|$|The {{eyes are}} dark chestnut. It has an {{elongated}} head. Its black nose is well-developed, and the lips are pendent. It {{has a deep}} chest, and a strong back. The tail is elegant and saber.The colour of the coat is white with black patches, sometimes speckled or ticked with black. Ears and face around the eyes are black and the cheeks are tan, but {{there should not be}} a tricolour appearance. Two tan markings are above the eyes, and sometimes a tan marking is found on the base of the upper thigh, which is called the [...] "roe buck mark". Faults, which indicate the dog should not be bred, include lack of substance, weak back, deviated tail, <b>cow</b> <b>hocked,</b> or legs that are too angulated or straight, which would impede running ability, as well as being off-colour or overly aggressive or overly shy.|$|E
5000|$|Many times Arabians, Trakehners, {{and horses}} of Arabian descent {{are thought to}} have <b>cow</b> <b>hocks.</b> But really the fetlocks are in {{alignment}} beneath the hocks, so they’re not true <b>cow</b> <b>hocks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Cow-hocked (adj.) or <b>cow</b> <b>hocks</b> (n.) {{describes}} a {{defect in the}} [...] of four-legged animals, primarily of livestock and horses, but also of dogs and cats.|$|R
5000|$|Medial {{deviation}} in true <b>cow</b> <b>hocks</b> causes {{strain on}} the inside of the hock joint, predisposing the horse to bone spavin. Abnormal twisting of pastern and cannon predisposes fetlocks to injury.|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} {{conformational}} defects {{that contribute to}} bone spavin. Those that cause uneven loading of the hocks, such as sickle <b>hocks</b> and <b>cow</b> <b>hocks,</b> are especially noteworthy. Poor trimming or shoeing can also contribute to bone spavin in any horse, {{no matter what their}} conformation.|$|R
50|$|The M'Bayar {{is a small}} stocky horse, broad in {{the chest}} and short in the neck. The legs are strong, but often suffer from <b>cow</b> <b>hocks</b> and other {{conformational}} defects. The predominant coat colour is bay, but grey, roan and chestnut are also commonly seen. The M'Bayar is calm and docile, rustic, strong and enduring.|$|R
50|$|Because the hock takes a {{great deal}} of strain in all {{performance}} disciplines, correct conformation is essential if the horse is to have a sound and productive working life. Common conformational defects include sickle hocks, post-legged conformation/straight <b>hocks,</b> <b>cow</b> <b>hocks,</b> and bowed hocks. Depending {{on the use of the}} horse, some defects may be more acceptable than others.|$|R
50|$|The body is {{slightly}} {{longer than the}} height or nearly square and with well-muscled forequarters and hindquarters. Legs are straight and parallel. Front feet are directed forward or slightly east-west and hind legs are straight and in many dogs slightly cow-hocked. The breed standard rejects square body proportions, <b>cow</b> <b>hocks</b> and east-west position of front feet. The angulation at stifles is normally developed and look like in wild canids. Feet are strong, compact and elongate. Toes are strong, flexible and well arched.|$|R
5000|$|The Canarian hound is {{a slender}} and lightly built but sturdy dog, of medium size, with height at the withers {{approximately}} 55 to 64 cm (21.7 to 25.2 ins) for males, females are slightly smaller. Sizes {{vary with the}} terrain on which the dog hunts. The short, dense coat should be some shade of red, white, {{or a combination of}} red and white, depending on the island and, in some cases, the specific area on some of the islands. There should be no other colour on the coat, or indeed anywhere on the body, as even the dog's nose, nails and skin should be a shade of red, and they are even known to [...] "blush" [...] when excited. The neck is long, the head is longer than it is wide, and the large ears are carried fully up. The long tail is usually seen low set but can be raised. The tail is not carried too high when moving. The dog should move in an extended and agile trot. Faults, which indicate that a particular dog should not be bred, include aspects of appearance as well as structural faults that would prevent the dog's ability to move and hunt, such as <b>cow</b> <b>hocks,</b> and crossing of the fore and hind legs at a trot.|$|R
5000|$|The Ameri-Indian Alaskan Husky is a {{sub-type of}} the Alaskan Husky, a type, or a {{category}} of dog. This sub-type {{is reminiscent of the}} more family oriented Native American or Trap-line dogs, noted for strong family/human ties and strong, enduring body type suited to the ever-changing temperatures. The native dogs were utilized not only as hunting dogs but as family companion/protector and beast of burden (pulling a travois or carrying like a pack animal). The effort to return to and to improve sound bodies and minds, the Ameri-Indian type are a calmer, more focused type of Alaskan Husky. Easier to work with and train, they are notable family dogs who adapt easily to different living environments.The Ameri-Indian Husky can be any colour but, most notably, are varying shades of sable (wolf sable, black sable, red sable, buff sable). They can have any colour of eyes (blue, gold, brown) and a neat nose with good width between the eyes. Ears are erect and set slightly up on their head (not as high set as a German Shepherd) and do vary in length but the intent is to have a longer ear with a wide base. Full face masks are not accepted but dogs with [...] "goggling" [...] around their eyes is accepted as well as white down the nose. Tails do not curl up over the back like a [...] "Spitz" [...] dog or Siberian Husky, instead being sickle shaped. They are level across the back with a good straight hind leg (no slope) with <b>cow</b> <b>hocks</b> allowed as well as front legs that are easty-westy that contribute to sounder joints with high physical impact. Long through the neck (carrying more of their weight ahead of the shoulder) and good bone structure and width to handle physical exertion. These dogs do come with pedigree documentation obtainable only from the single breeding program currently working to re-establish these great dogs.|$|R
40|$|AbstractLameness is {{a severe}} welfare problem and a production-limiting disease in dairy farming. The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine prevalence of lameness and investigate cow- and herd-level factors associated with lameness in dairy cows housed in freestall barns in 3 Canadian provinces. A purposive sample of 40 Holstein-Friesian cows was selected from each of 141 dairy farms in Québec, Ontario, and Alberta. In total, 5, 637 cows were scored once for lameness (presence of limping when walking). Data collected included information on individual <b>cows</b> (<b>hock</b> lesions, claw length, body condition score, parity, days in milk, and milk production), management practices (floor and stall cleaning routine, bedding routine, and footbath practices), and facility design (stall dimensions, stall base and bedding type, width of feed alley, flooring type, and slipperiness) hypothesized to be risk factors for lameness. Multilevel mixed logistic regression models were constructed (including farm as a random effect and province as a fixed effect). Herd-level lameness prevalence ranged from 0 to 69 % (mean= 21 %). Lameness prevalence increased with increasing parity; compared with first parity, cows in parity 2, 3, and ≥ 4 had 1. 6, 3. 3, and 4 times, respectively, higher odds of being lame. Furthermore, the odds of lameness were 1. 6 times greater in cows with low body condition score (≤ 2. 5) than in cows with a higher body condition score. In addition, injured hocks and overgrown claws were associated with 1. 4 - and 1. 7 -fold increased odds of being lame, respectively, whereas every 1 kg increase in daily milk production was associated with a 3 % decrease in the odds of being lame. Lameness prevalence was higher in herds with ≤ 100 cows, but lower in barns with a sand or dirt stall base, or with bedding ≥ 2 cm deep. Cows exposed to very slippery floors had 2 times the odds of being lame compared with cows exposed to nonslippery floors. We attributed the wide range of lameness prevalence to the great variability in facilities and management practices among farms. Finally, we inferred that the prevalence of lameness could be decreased by improving management of multiparous, thin, or injured cows and by adopting management practices intended to improve cow comfort, namely the floor’s slip resistance and the stall’s lying surface...|$|R
40|$|Improving cow comfort {{has been}} shown to provide large {{increases}} in milk yield, cow health and reduced cull rates of underproducing cows. Over the years animal size has increased and confinement systems have evolved so that many producers have to decide if remodeling their freestalls can improve cow comfort and reduce undue cull rates thus increasing their bottom line. Cushion: Improving the cushion in cows laying area can improve the comfort of the animal. Producers have several alternatives to explore such as, deep bedded sand, sand over a matt or concrete, deep bedded organic bedding, mats or mattresses with more cushion, and recycled manure solids. Each deep bedded sand stall may use about seven to nine tons of sand a year. This option is very <b>cow</b> friendly as <b>hock</b> lesions almost disappear. Sand is groomed daily and sand in the cow alleys improves traction and the improved footing reduces slipping when cows show estrus. The drawback is the manure handling becomes more difficult and expensive. If you have good stall dimensions. a bedding keeper or sand over a mattress could improve cushion with less sand cost and little remodeling. Another option some pick is to purchase a mat with more cushion under the harder rubber top. These mats require little remodeling but producers should remember that raising the platform a couple of inches might decrease comfort unless you raise the neck rail. Using recycled sand or manure solids increases cow comfort but require a major investment in structure and management time and resources. Both sand and manure solids will need to sit and drain moisture or heat and kill bacteria. Given an increase of pathogens to the udder with these systems producers must decide if they will invest their time and ability to meet the increased demands. Stall Dimensions: Over time cows have been bred to be larger which sometimes puts them in stalls that were developed for smaller cows. New stall width and length recommendations {{can be found in the}} following chart...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the risk factors associated with 3 presentations of hock lesions (hair loss, ulceration, and swelling) in freestall-housed lactating cattle. By independent identification and scoring of, and analysis of the factors associated with, hair loss, ulceration, and swelling, the aim was to identify whether risk factors were common to all 3, or differed among the presentations. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 76 herds in the UK during the winter housing period of 2007 to 2008, with a total of 3, 691 <b>cows</b> examined for <b>hock</b> lesions. A randomly selected sample of approximately 50 cows in each herd were scored for body condition, lameness, cleanliness, rising behavior, and lesions at the <b>hocks.</b> For all <b>cows,</b> hair loss, ulceration, and swelling were scored separately on 4 -point scales, with both left and right hocks scored. Based on a review of the literature, potential risk factors were identified and measured, collected from milk-recording data, or obtained through interviews with the farmers. Risk factors associated with hocks lesions in cattle were examined using data from the 2, 982 cows housed in the 63 freestall-housed herds visited. Risk factors for each of the 3 lesion presentations were considered separately in multilevel logistic regression models, with moderate or severe hair loss, any degree of ulceration, and moderate or severe swelling as the outcome variables. Thirty risk factors were identified, none of which were common to all 3 lesion presentations. Five risk factors (locomotion score, number of days of winter housing, mean milk yield, freestall base material, and herd size) were common to both hair loss and ulceration. The stall bedding material was a common risk factor for both hair loss and swelling. A further 8, 5, and 11 risk factors were unique to hair loss, ulceration, and swelling, respectively. The existence of several differential risk factors between the 2 lesion presentations suggests that ulceration may not always be a direct extension of hair loss, as has been implied in previous scoring systems. Of the 12 risk factors associated with swelling, only 1 was common to another lesion presentation, which suggests that swelling may have a different etiology than hair loss and ulceration. The variables associated with the lesions indicate the importance of factors that affect the lying and rising behavior of the animal, including freestall structure and design, and the lying surface...|$|R
