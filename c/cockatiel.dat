5|$|All {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} except the <b>cockatiel</b> {{are protected by}} the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which restricts import and export of wild-caught parrots to special licensed purposes. Five cockatoo species (including all subspecies)—the Tanimbar corella (Cacatua goffiniana), red-vented cockatoo (Cacatua haematuropygia), Moluccan cockatoo (Cacatua moluccensis), yellow-crested cockatoo (Cacatua sulphurea) and palm cockatoo (Probosciger aterrimus)—are protected on the CITES Appendix I list. With {{the exception of the}} <b>cockatiel,</b> all remaining cockatoo species are protected on the CITES Appendix II list.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{are popular}} birds in aviculture, but their needs are {{difficult}} to meet. The <b>cockatiel</b> is the easiest cockatoo species to maintain and {{is by far the}} most frequently kept in captivity. White cockatoos are more commonly found in captivity than black cockatoos. Illegal trade in wild-caught birds contributes to the decline of some cockatoo species in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos are {{recognisable}} by the showy crests and curved bills. Their plumage {{is generally}} less colourful {{than that of}} other parrots, being mainly white, grey or black and often with coloured features in the crest, cheeks or tail. On average they are larger than other parrots; however, the <b>cockatiel,</b> the smallest cockatoo species, is a small bird. The phylogenetic position of the <b>cockatiel</b> remains unresolved, other than that {{it is one of}} the earliest offshoots of the cockatoo lineage. The remaining species are in two main clades. The five large black coloured cockatoos of the genus Calyptorhynchus form one branch. The second and larger branch is formed by the genus Cacatua, comprising 11 species of white-plumaged cockatoos and four monotypic genera that branched off earlier; namely the pink and white Major Mitchell's cockatoo, the pink and grey galah, the mainly grey gang-gang cockatoo and the large black-plumaged palm cockatoo.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cockatiels</b> are {{relatively}} vocal birds, the calls {{of the male}} being more varied {{than that of the}} female. <b>Cockatiels</b> can also be taught to sing specific melodies. Much like parrots, but not quite to that extent, <b>Cockatiels</b> can be taught to repeat words spoken by human owners.|$|R
5000|$|... "Whiteface" [...] <b>cockatiels</b> {{have their}} lutein (yellow and orange) {{pigments}} deactivated by the blue gene, resulting in <b>cockatiels</b> {{with absolutely no}} lutein pigments whatsoever. Consequently, White-faced <b>cockatiels</b> are mainly grey with more or less white throughout their plumage. Whitefaced cocks display brilliant white faces while hens display basically grey faces with some white streaks. With {{the availability of the}} Whiteface mutation, the <b>cockatiel's</b> wide colour varieties are divided into 2 main classes (or series) ...|$|R
5000|$|Although <b>cockatiels</b> {{in their}} natural-habitats of Australia eat mainly grass seeds, captive <b>cockatiels</b> feed on either dry, sprouted and/or soaked seeds. A diet of only dry seeds is {{inadequate}} for <b>cockatiels</b> and/or any parrot species' optimum health. Avian veterinarians recommend pet birds' diets be supplemented with foods such as: ...|$|R
5|$|The <b>cockatiel</b> {{is by far}} the {{cockatoo}} species {{most frequently}} kept in captivity. Among U.S. bird keepers that participated in a survey by APPMA in 2003/04, 39% had cockatiels, as opposed to only 3% that had (other) cockatoo species. The white cockatoos are more often encountered in aviculture than the black cockatoos. Black cockatoos are rarely seen in European zoos due to export restrictions on Australian wildlife but birds seized by governments have been loaned.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{are often}} very affectionate with their owner {{and at times}} other people but can demand {{a great deal of}} attention. Furthermore, their intense curiosity means they must be given a steady supply of objects to tinker with, chew, {{dismantle}} and destroy. Parrots in captivity may suffer from boredom, which can lead to stereotypic behaviour patterns, such as feather-plucking. Feather plucking is likely to stem from psychological rather than physical causes. Other major drawbacks include their painful bites, and their piercing screeches. The salmon-crested and white cockatoo species are particular offenders. All cockatoos have a fine powder on their feathers, which may induce allergies in certain people. In general, the smaller cockatoo species such as Goffin's and quieter Galah's cockatoos are much easier to keep as pets. The <b>cockatiel</b> {{is one of the most}} popular and easiest parrots to keep as a pet, and many colour mutations are available in aviculture.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{occupy a}} wide range of {{habitats}} from forests in subalpine regions to mangroves. However, no species is found in all types of habitat. The most widespread species, such as the galah and <b>cockatiel,</b> are open-country specialists that feed on grass seeds. They are often highly mobile fast flyers and are nomadic. Flocks of birds move across large areas of the inland, locating and feeding on seed and other food sources. Drought may force flocks from more arid areas to move further into farming areas. Other cockatoo species, such as the glossy black cockatoo, inhabit woodlands, rainforests, shrublands and even alpine forests. The red-vented cockatoo inhabits mangroves and its absence from northern Luzon {{may be related to the}} lack of mangrove forests there. Forest-dwelling cockatoos are generally sedentary, as the food supply is more stable and predictable. Several species have adapted well to human modified habitats and are found in agricultural areas and even busy cities.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to other parrots, {{male and female}} <b>cockatiels</b> both take part in raising their young. <b>Cockatiels</b> are the only members of the parrot family that do not feed their partner, therefore {{both male and female}} <b>cockatiels</b> incubate the eggs and raise their young together, where the male usually sits at night and the female during the day, but it can vary.|$|R
5000|$|Pied <b>cockatiels</b> have large, random blotches of colour {{on their}} bodies, after the [...] "normal grey" [...] or [...] "wild type" [...] of a <b>cockatiel's</b> plumage is {{primarily}} grey with prominent white flashes {{on the outer}} edges of each wing.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>cockatiels</b> enjoy {{looking at}} {{themselves}} in mirrors and will {{engage in the}} activity for hours. <b>Cockatiels</b> that are exposed to mirrors perceive their reflections as their mates. This can induce hormonal behaviour (aggression and self-stimulation in males, egg-laying in females) or frustration (due to the perceived non-responsiveness of the bird in the mirror) which {{can also lead to}} aggression. Upon seeing themselves once, <b>cockatiels</b> are likely to experience anxiety until they find the mirror again.|$|R
5|$|The plumage of the {{cockatoos}} is less brightly coloured {{than that}} of the other parrots, with species generally being either black, grey or white. Many species have smaller areas of colour on their plumage, often yellow, pink and red, usually on the crest or tail. The galah and Major Mitchell's cockatoo are more broadly coloured in pink tones. Several species have a brightly coloured bare area around the eye and face known as a periophthalmic ring; the large red patch of bare skin of the palm cockatoo is the most extensive and covers some of the face, while it is more restricted in some other species of white cockatoo, notably the corellas and blue-eyed cockatoo. The plumage of males and females is similar in most species. The plumage of the female <b>cockatiel</b> is duller than the male, but the most marked sexual dimorphism occurs in the gang-gang cockatoo and the two species of black cockatoos in the subgenus Calyptorhynchus, namely the red-tailed and glossy black cockatoos. The iris colour differs in a few species, being pink or red in the female galah and Major Mitchell's cockatoo and red-brown in some other female white cockatoo species. The males all have dark brown irises.|$|E

25|$|The zoo sees {{its primary}} goal as the {{conservation}} of endangered species. These include animals mentioned in the Bible which are now extinct in Israel, such as the Asian lion, the Syrian brown bear, the Asiatic cheetah, the Nile crocodile, and the Persian fallow deer. It also includes endangered species worldwide, such as the Asian elephant, rare species of macaw, the <b>cockatiel,</b> the ibis, and the golden lion tamarin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cockatiels</b> are {{generally}} {{kept in a}} cage and allowed to exercise and socialise with their owners outside of the cage {{for a few hours}} a day (at least 1 to 2 hours). In a specially prepared household environment, <b>cockatiels</b> may be permitted to roam freely about a home or apartment, and owners may take certain precautions such as wing clipping or using a flight harness if the rooms have hazards that might pose a risk to the bird. As a social bird, <b>cockatiels</b> prefer areas with a lot of activity during the waking hours, and will return to a secluded area when it is time to sleep. <b>Cockatiels</b> may nap on or near their owners, including the owner's chest and shoulders if the owner is stationary {{for a long period of}} time.|$|R

500|$|The {{relationships}} among various cockatoo genera are largely resolved, although {{the placement of}} the <b>cockatiel</b> (Nymphicus hollandicus) {{at the base of the}} cockatoos remains uncertain. The <b>cockatiel</b> is alternatively placed basal to all other cockatoo species, as the sister taxon to the black cockatoo species of the genus Calyptorhynchus or as the sister taxon to a clade consisting of the white and pink cockatoo genera as well as the palm cockatoo. The remaining species are within two main clades, one consisting of the black species of the genus Calyptorhynchus while the other contains the remaining species. According to most authorities, the second clade includes the black palm cockatoo (Probosciger), the gray and reddish galah (Eolophus), the gang-gang cockatoo (Callocephalon) [...] and the pinkish Major Mitchell's cockatoo (Lophochroa), although Probosciger is sometimes placed basal to all other species. The remaining species are mainly white or slightly pinkish and all belong to the genus Cacatua. The genera Eolophus, Lophochroa and Cacatua are hypomelanistic. The genus Cacatua is further subdivided into the subgenera Licmetis, commonly known as corellas, and Cacatua, referred to as white cockatoos. Confusingly, the term [...] "white cockatoo" [...] has also been applied to the whole genus. The five cockatoo species of the genus Calyptorhynchus are commonly known as black cockatoos, and are divided into two subgenera— Calyptorhynchus and Zanda. The former group are sexually dichromatic, with the females having prominently barred plumage. [...] The two are also distinguished by differences in the food begging calls of juveniles.|$|E
500|$|Despite being friends, she {{has driven}} Margaret to {{distraction}} on several occasions. Most notably in [...] "Only a Story", when {{she stayed with}} the Meldrews after her flat had been flooded and drove Margaret {{to the point of}} distraction with her complaining and laziness. Jean was also shown as a somewhat absent-minded character, as she has a pet <b>cockatiel</b> despite having a lifelong allergy to feathers. She would often bore the Meldrews by showing them her complete collection of holiday pictures at the most unwelcome times. A running joke is her beating Victor at board-games, including Trivial Pursuit and chess, while having a conversation with someone else. Doreen Mantle described her character as [...] "wanting {{to do the right thing}} but always finding out that it was the wrong thing".|$|E
50|$|Adding {{these foods}} {{provides}} additional nutrients and can prevent obesity and lipomas, as can substituting millet, which is relatively low in fat, for higher-fat seed mixes. Adult <b>cockatiels</b> {{often do not}} always adapt readily to dietary additions, so {{care must be taken}} to introduce healthy diets as young as possible (ideally weaned onto fresh foods before introducing chicks to seeds). <b>Cockatiels</b> like any other parrots learn mainly by mimicry and thus most adult <b>cockatiels</b> will be easily encouraged to try new foods by observing another bird eating the food, or by placing the new food on a mirror.|$|R

50|$|Although female <b>cockatiels</b> are {{not often}} known to speak, {{this is not}} an absolute. Females {{generally}} don't imitate speech, but tend to mimic sounds such as telephones, washing machines, toilet flushes, and other household noises. <b>Cockatiels</b> that do imitate speech will usually mimic frequently heard phrases, particularly of the individual to whom the bird feels closest.|$|R
500|$|The {{cockatoos}} {{are generally}} medium to large parrots of stocky build, {{which range from}} [...] in length and [...] in weight; however, one species, the <b>cockatiel,</b> is considerably smaller and slimmer than the other species, being [...] long (including its long pointed tail feathers) and [...] in weight. The movable headcrest, which is present in all cockatoos, is spectacular in many species; it is raised when the bird lands from flying or when it is aroused. Cockatoos share many features with other parrots, including the characteristic curved beak shape and a zygodactyl foot, with the two middle toes forward and the two outer toes backward. They differ {{in the presence of}} an erectile crest and their lack of the Dyck texture feather composition which causes the bright blues and greens seen in true parrots.|$|E
500|$|The nesting hollows {{are lined}} with sticks, wood chips and {{branches}} with leaves. The eggs of cockatoos are oval and initially white, as their location makes camouflage unnecessary. However, they do become discoloured {{over the course of}} incubation. They range in size from [...] in the palm and red-tailed black cockatoos, to [...] in the <b>cockatiel.</b> Clutch size varies within the family, with the palm cockatoo and some other larger cockatoos laying only a single egg and the smaller species laying anywhere between two and eight eggs. Food supply also plays a role in clutch size. Some species can lay a second clutch if the first fails. Around 20% of eggs laid are infertile. The cockatoos' incubation and brooding responsibilities may either be undertaken by the female alone {{in the case of the}} black cockatoos or shared amongst the sexes as happens in the other species. In the case of the black cockatoos, the female is provisioned by the male several times a day. The young of all species are born covered in yellowish down, bar the palm cockatoo, whose young are born naked. Cockatoo incubation times are dependent on species size, with the smaller cockatiels having a period of around 20days and the larger Carnaby's black cockatoo incubating its eggs for up to 29days.|$|E
