40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA methodology for solar energy system design improvement {{has been developed}} and coupled with a constrained function optimization code resulting in an automated solar energy system design procedure. The scope of the methodology is limited to systems using flat plate collectors and water as the working fluid. Eight parameters have been included as independent design variables. The design variables included collector area, collector tile angle, collector and storage fluid stream velocities, and collector to storage heat exchanger dimensions. The procedure includes an accounting for economic parameters as an intimate part of the design process. The resulting methodology {{has been used for}} the design of solar energy systems which would use shelf item collectors for the purposes of determining the optimum design variable vector for a given situation. The methodology could also be used on a limited basis for collector design optimization by exploring the effects of changing selected collector parameters on system performance. The methodology is coded in the FORTRAN computer language under the name SOLCAD- 1 (SOLAR ENERGY OPTIMIZATION ANALYSIS OR DESIGN). Initial system trials indicate complete stability with minimal constraint activations. Eased on the results of approximately fifty design experiments using SOLDAD- 1, new findings concerning optimum collector tilt angle and an invariant optimum <b>collector</b> <b>flow</b> <b>factor</b> are suggested.

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{analyzes}} the thermal {{performance of a}} single-pass flat plate solar air collector (SAC) {{in the case of}} severe dust deposition surface. Experiments of the SAC with both severe dust deposition surface and clean cover surface are conducted using the steady-state test (SST) method, in order to show a contrast. The mathematical relation between the combined standard uncertainty of the predicted thermal efficiency and the uncertainties of the experimental results is presented. And the collector characteristic parameters, such as the collector heat removal <b>factor,</b> the <b>collector</b> <b>flow</b> efficiency <b>factor,</b> the total heat loss coefficients, etc. are obtained. The results show that, the predicted thermal efficiency in the case of severe dust deposition surface is decreased by 10. 7 % - 21. 0 % when the normalized temperature difference ranges from 0 to 0. 04. And the optical efficiency of the SAC with severe dust deposition surface is decreased by 8. 39 % in contrast with the case of clean cover surface...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} an {{approach}} has been developed to investigate the influence of surface roughness on thermohydrodynamic performance in aligned and misaligned journal bearings by considering an average flow model and deriving the shear <b>flow</b> <b>factor</b> for various roughness configurations, similar to the pressure <b>flow</b> <b>factor.</b> An average Reynolds equation for rough surfaces is defined in term of pressure and shear <b>flow</b> <b>factors,</b> which {{can be obtained by}} numerical flow simulation, though the use of measured or numerically generated rough surfaces. Reynolds, heat conduction and energy equations are solved simultaneously by using a suitable numerical technique (Finite Difference Method) to obtain the pressure and temperature distribution through the oil film thickness of the journal bearing. These equations are obtained for isotropic surfaces and for surfaces with directional patterns. The <b>flow</b> <b>factors</b> for these surfaces are expressed as empirical relations in term of normalized oil film thickness (h/&# 963;) and surface characteristic (&# 947;) defined as the ratio of x and z correlation lengths.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{enhanced}} and cost-effective performance of engineering components, Surface Engineering embraces traditional and innovative surface technologies which modify the surface properties of metallic and non-metallic engineering components for specific and sometime unique engineering purposes. The surface roughness of an engineered surface may be classified as: the random surface roughness which {{is a product of}} surface finishing and the deterministic surface roughness which is engineered to increase the lubrication characteristics of the hydro dynamically lubricated thrust ring. The effect of stochastic/random roughness can not be ignored when the roughness is of the same amplitude as that of fluid film thickness. Average flow model derived in terms of <b>flow</b> <b>factors</b> which are functions of the roughness characteristics is used to study the random surface roughness effects on hydrodynamic lubrication of deterministic asperity.

40|$|This {{progress}} report describes the thermodynamic testing and modeling of a thermosyphon heat exchanger used in solar water heating systems. Testing of a four tube-in-shell thermosyphon heat exchanger {{was performed in}} two parts. The first portion of the test increased the collector fluid while the storage tank remained isothermal. After the collector fluid temperature was raised to 95 C, {{the second part of}} the test allowed the storage tank to gain heat. The test was performed for two <b>collector</b> <b>flow</b> rates. Measured values included <b>collector</b> side forced <b>flow</b> rate, temperature differences across the heat exchanger, vertical temperature distribution in the storage tank, vertical water temperature profile in the heat exchanger, and pressure drop on the thermosyphon side of the heat exchanger. The overall heat transfer coefficient-area product (UA) values obtained confirmed that models which assume UA depends solely on thermosyphon flow rate do not adequately characterize thermosyphon heat exchangers. This is because heat transfer in thermosyphon exchangers occurs in the mixed convection, rather than forced flow, regime. A linear regression equation was developed to better predict UA using the Prandtl, Reynolds, and Grashof numbers and dimensionless parameters based on fluid properties calculated for the average hot and cold leg temperatures. 9 figs...|$|R
40|$|The real {{effects in}} electrohydrodynamic {{lubrication}} (EHL,) are discussed {{and the role}} of stochastic roughness superimposed on the nominal solid boundaries is considered. The full film EHL regime where incipient asperity contact bears a negligible fraction of the load is analyzed. Flow, from which an averaged Reynolds equation can be formed, is nonetheless modified by the amplitude and texture of the roughness patterns. It is found that only two extra parameters are needed, the rms surface height and the ratio of the correlation lengths in the two principal roughness directions. In a lowest order perturbation expansion of these <b>flow</b> <b>factors</b> in powers of the ratio of rms roughness to nominal film thickness, no other properties of the roughness appear. The <b>factors</b> describing Poiseuille <b>flow</b> are separable into the sum of two single surface <b>flow</b> <b>factors</b> which means that a combination of a single equivalent rough surface versus an ideal smooth surface is found. For flow entrained by slip velocity the factors separate instead into a difference of single surface factors and it becomes significant which of the two surfaces carries the equivalent roughness. Applications of the averaged Reynolds equation based on the <b>flow</b> <b>factor</b> method to the EHL line contact problem are discussed. The partial EHL regime is considered where comparable load fractions are carried by the hydrodynamic film and by incipient mechanical contact. An extension of the method into this regime by combining it with asperity contact models appears most encouraging...|$|R

The methods given are also used for the evaluation of the uncertainties associated with the peaking factors, including the results of a sensitivity analysis developed with the code INCORE. Flow calculations have been performed with the code COBRA III C. The original version of the code COBRA III C has been expanded and a method is given to easily handle any further change in the code. A sensitivity a! nalysis, using the code COBRA III C shows the weak sensitivity of the exit conditions of the coolant on most input parameters and on the inlet flow distribution of the coolant selected for the calculation. This low sensitivity indicates that the information obtained from the assembly exit thermocouple cannot be used for the determination of the cross flow pattern between the fuel assemblies.

40|$|Supersonic vortex {{plane and}} {{axisymmetric}} flows of non-viscous non-heatconductive gas with arbitrary thermodynamic {{properties in the}} vicinity of a steady shock wave are studied. The differential equations describing the gas flow exterior to the discontinuity surface and the dynamic compatibility conditions at this discontinuity are used. The gas flow nonuniformity in the shock vicinity is described by the space derivatives of the gasdynamic parameters at a point on the shock surface. The parameters are the gas pressure, density, velocity vector. The derivatives with respect to the directions of the streamline and normal to it, and of the shock surface and normal to it are considered. Space derivatives of all gasdynamic parameters are expressed through the <b>flow</b> nonisobaric <b>factor</b> along the streamline, the streamline curvature, and the flow vorticity and non-isoenthalpy factors. An algorithm for these factors of the gas flow downstream a shock wave determination is developed. Examples of these factors calculation for imperfect oxygen and thermodynamically perfect gas are presented. The influence coefficients of the upstream <b>flow</b> <b>factors</b> on the downstream <b>flow</b> <b>factors</b> are calculated.
