40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{investigated}} {{the validity of}} routine hospital and mortality hip fracture data in one English Region and estimated trends in hip fracture between 1978 - 1981 and 1993 - 1995. METHODS: We identified from Hospital Episode System (HES) data for 1993 - 1995 all hip fracture episodes relating to individual patients aged over 65 years resident in Wessex. We determined from the discharge method code whether an individual had died during that admission. The number of individual regional and district admissions and deaths were compared with those presented in the Public Health Common Data Set. We compared regional admission rates with data for 1978 - 1981 from a previous study. RESULTS: National <b>comparative</b> <b>indicators</b> for hip fracture overestimated individual admissions in Wessex by 17 per cent (in health authorities by 1 - 56 per cent). National <b>comparative</b> <b>indicators</b> for hip fracture mortality underestimated individual deaths in Wessex by 48 per cent. Between 1978 - 1981 and 1993 - 1995 the age-sex-standardized hip fracture rates rose from 1. 90 to 2. 63 per 1000 per year for men and from 5. 70 to 7. 70 per 1000 per year for women. Rates increased in all age groups except those aged 65 - 69 years. There was also a small fall in absolute mean annual numbers in this age group. The rates also fell in females aged 70 - 74. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to adjust routine national HES data {{to take account of}} multiple episodes within a single admission. These methods should be applied to national <b>comparative</b> <b>indicators</b> for hip fracture admission and deaths. Hip fracture rates continue to rise in those aged over 70 years. There may be a cohort effect with those born after 1925 showing stable rates which needs further investigation...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{synthesis}} of several specific approaches of productivity in services, {{in order to provide}} a better argued theoretical basis for a realistic assessment of the values of several <b>comparative</b> <b>indicators.</b> From a conceptual point of view, the paper will take as a base some definitions of productivity as a quantitative and industrial indicator, revealing certain aspects that need a widening of the area of approach, in the purpose of being suitable for immaterial activities. Based on the brief analysis of productivity, performance and servicity indicators, the research establishes correlations between them in the immaterial field. Elder and, as well, most recent analyses found in the field literature are used, from most rigorous sources, and they are supplemented with own approaches; such approaches ore pointing out several most specific features that are specially set for services and intellect-intensive activities. Technical and financial aspects of common productivity are taken into account, as well as performance in realising various goals, non-economic here included, and the service components, in a complex approach. The presentation focus on nuance features in the quoted references, in the purpose of a fine defining of the indictors and approaches. Specific particularization is achieved based on the literature. Methodologically, the paper is approaching in an unorthodox manner, the plus of value issued from the human activity, i. e. being in a view coming from a fine analysis of the service performed by any economic activity, in a market system. The conceptual importance of these <b>comparative</b> <b>indicators</b> is concisely highlighted, and it consists mainly in the opening that can become a useful ground for practical applicative analyses, which actually are proposed in the future developments of the topic.

40|$|Deterministic dynamic {{models for}} coupled {{resident}} and invader populations are considered {{with the purpose}} of finding quantities that are effective at predicting when the invasive population will become established asymptotically. A key feature of the models considered is the stage-structure, meaning that the populations are described by vectors of discrete developmental stage- or age-classes. The vector structure permits exotic transient behaviour-phenomena not encountered in scalar models. Analysis using a linear Lyapunov function demonstrates that for the class of population models considered, a large so-called population inertia is indicative of successful invasion. Population inertia is an indicator of transient growth or decline. Furthermore, for the class of models considered, we find that the so-called invasion exponent, an existing index used in models for invasion, is not always a reliable <b>comparative</b> <b>indicator</b> of successful invasion.

40|$|After {{the intense}} and {{unprecedented}} urbanisation {{of the last}} centuries, {{it is more than}} evident that a clear understanding of the ongoing trends of urban growth and clustering is needed if we are to aim for a better insight as to their possible future. The main aim of this paper is the definition of a methodological framework for the determination, analysis and cross-evaluation of urban clusters which are formulated within wider study areas, such as administrative regions. To this end, different methods and techniques are utilised, that stem from the fields of Statistics and Quantitative Spatial Analysis and which, during recent years, are all the more commonly applied to the different stages of Geographical Analysis. The definition of urban clusters is mainly based on different types of variables, such as the demographic characteristics of the cities, the number of public and private sector services located in them, as well as the total length of the different types of road network in the study area. Furthermore, a <b>comparative</b> <b>indicator</b> of spatial concentration is formulated that reflects the role and the relative weight of every urban area in the study region as well as its spatial influence. Such a measurement improves the definition and analysis of urban clusters and at the same time, constitutes an alternative assessment of their overall locational perspective.

40|$|The Coping Strategies Index (CSI) was {{developed}} as a context-specific indicator of food insecurity that counts up and weights coping behaviors at the household level. It has proven useful to operational humanitarian agencies and researchers in measuring localized food insecurity, but to date has not been useful to compare the relative severity of different crises and has therefore has not been particularly useful for geographic targeting or resource allocation. This paper analyzes data from 14 surveys in crisis-affected or chronically vulnerable countries in Sub-Saharan Africa that incorporated the context-specific CSI. The paper identifies a sub-set of individual coping behaviors common to all surveys, whose severity is regarded as broadly similar by households across these studies. Data from these studies were re-analyzed using a reduced index constructed from only these behaviors. Correlations of this new index with other known food security indicators {{are similar to those}} of the complete, context-specific CSI. This suggests the possibility that an indicator based on these common behaviors could be used to compare the types of food security crises analyzed here across different contexts - particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa - to improve geographic targeting and resource allocation, according to the severity of crises.
