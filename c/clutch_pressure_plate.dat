Such specific output, only one pound per horsepower, is rarely achieved in reciprocating engines, {{even in the most}} highly developed aircraft types. The dramatic reduction of weight was gained by using aluminum for the cylinder block, cylinder heads, water pump, starter motor body, flywheel, and <b>clutch</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>plate.</b> In the cylinder block, no bore liners are used and the pistons run directly on specially treated aluminum bores. Magnesium is used for the clutch housing, fuel injection manifold, and manifold adapter plate.

5000|$|The TRX250R was {{introduced}} for the 1986 model year to answer Suzuki’s LT250R, released the year prior. Honda borrowed many parts from its 3 wheel ATC250R for the Fourtrax’s design, including {{the engine and}} rear suspension. Although mechanically similar, Honda detuned the engine {{for use in the}} Fourtrax, through reduced compression and less aggressive porting, to ensure that the added weight of the quad would not adversely affect the reliability of the engine. [...] The 1987 model year, now absent the three-wheelers due to the CPSC ban, saw the engine receive a five-millimeter longer connecting rod, accompanied by a piston with a wrist pin bore raised five millimeters. Additionally, the cylinder was changed to include a bridged intake. Most of the chassis of the 1987 Fourtrax remained the same. The 1988 model year brought the most dramatic changes to the TRX250R. The compression ratio of the engine was raised to generate more power, bringing it nearly on par with Kawasaki’s powervalved Tecate-4. It was the chassis, however, that received the greatest attention, shedding 25 pounds over the previous year’s model. Additionally a shorter aluminum swing arm was added, but the frame lengthened such that the overall wheelbase was slightly greater. This shifted the weight bias rearward, curing the Fourtrax’s “loop out” problem. Aesthetically, the Fourtrax’s headlight was moved from the handlebars to a mount molded into the hood. This was also the only year to be available with red fenders. For 1989 the TRX250R received few changes. Most notable was the use of a needle bearing in the <b>clutch</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> for smoother action. This needle bearing was a necessary upgrade for the 1988 TRX250R, as well 3. The color was returned to white for its final year.|$|E

40|$|The {{friction}} clutch design is strongly {{dependent upon the}} frictional heat generated between contact surfaces during the slipping at beginning of engagement. Because of that the frictional heat generated firstly will reduce the performance of clutch system and then will lead to premature failure in some cases.

50|$|A dual-mass {{flywheel}} or DMF is {{a rotating}} mechanical device {{that is used}} to provide continuous energy (rotational energy) in systems where the energy source is not continuous, the same way as a conventional flywheel acts, but damping any violent variation of torque or revolutions that could cause an unwanted vibration. The vibration reduction is achieved by accumulating stored energy in the two flywheel half masses {{over a period of time}} but damped by a series of strong springs, doing that at a rate that is compatible with the energy source, and then releasing that energy at a much higher rate over a relatively short time. A compact dual-mass flywheel often includes the whole <b>clutch,</b> including the <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> and the friction disc.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} evolutionary algorithmfor the optimal design of friction clutch. Powerful evolutionary algorithm such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied for optimum design of friction clutch. The main objective function was to minimize the axial force between <b>clutch</b> <b>plate</b> and <b>pressure</b> <b>plate,</b> using diameter ratio and coefficient of friction as design variable and peripheral velocity as design constraint. The analysis in the present paper is based on understanding the relationship between diameter ratio and the design parameters like inner and outer diameters and peripheral velocity in order {{to arrive at the}} optimum design. It is shown that the dimensionless ratio of outer diameter to inner diameter is the most fundamental parameter, controlling all the major designs as well as performance parameters. The optimum design of clutch can be obtained, satisfying the constraint on design, by controlling design variable. The results of GA are compared with conventional optimization technique in order to satisfy the main objective function to minimize the axial force between <b>pressure</b> <b>plate</b> and <b>clutch</b> plate...|$|R
