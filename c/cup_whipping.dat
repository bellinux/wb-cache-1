50|$|His time at Preston was marred firstly by {{injuries}} {{and then by}} a change in manager, which saw Craig Brown replace David Moyes at the helm. Brown did not approve of Anderson's predominantly attacking play, and criticized him for his lack of defensive awareness. It is commonly thought that Anderson became unmotivated under Craig Brown and lost his focus. He was involved from the start in Preston North End's infamous victory in the Championship play-offs against Birmingham City (which Preston won following a penalty shootout, a game during which Birmingham City Manager, Trevor Francis, tried to take his players off the pitch in protest at the end the penalties were being taken from). Anderson also set up Richard Cresswell for Preston North End's goal against Chelsea in the FA <b>Cup,</b> <b>whipping</b> in a cross from a free kick, which Cresswell headed past Carlo Cudicini.|$|E

50|$|At {{the start}} of the 1770 season he walked over for a Subscription stakes. In October he won the Newmarket Challenge <b>Cup</b> and <b>Whip</b> for a second time, in another walkover. It was {{intended}} that he would run in a King's Plate against the undefeated Eclipse, but the day after the Cup he broke down in an exercise.|$|R

5000|$|As a horse owner, Shafto's {{thoroughbred}} racers included: Snap, {{which he}} bought in 1752 [...] and sold {{after it had}} won three 1000-guinea match races at Newmarket; Squirrel, another successful racer which was retired for stud in 1760 and lived until 1780; and Goldfinder, sired by Snap, which won two Newmarket Challenge <b>Cups</b> and <b>Whips</b> before being sold to stud.|$|R
60|$|Braham and Catalani, Fanny Kemble, and Turner's landscapes at his best, rise in {{my memory}} as supreme delights and revelations in their {{different}} lines, and awakening trains of thought; {{and then there was}} that entertainment which Griffith and Clarence gave us in their rooms, when they regaled us with all the delicacies of the season, and Peter and Gooch looked all pride and hospitality! The dining- parlour, or what served as such, was Griff's property, as any one could see by the pictures of horses, dogs, and ladies, the <b>cups,</b> <b>whips,</b> and boxing-gloves that adorned it; the sitting-room had tokens of other occupation, in Clarence's piano, window-box of flowers, and his one extravagance in engravings from Raffaelle, and a marine water-colour or two, besides all my own attempts at family portraits, with a case of well-bound books. Those two rooms were perfectly redolent of their masters--I say it literally--for the scent of flowers was in Clarence's room, and in Griff's, the odour of cigars had not wholly been destroyed even by much airing. For in those days it was regarded by parents and guardians as an objectionable thing.|$|R
50|$|His {{first race}} as a five-year-old was on 31 March, where he beat four horses to win a 150 guineas race. In October he faced five rivals in the Newmarket Challenge <b>Cup</b> and <b>Whip</b> (known as 'the Cup'). In the betting the Duke of Ancaster's Jethro was the 2/1 favourite, with Goldfinder at 5/2, Sir Charles Bunbury's Bellario at 4/1, 5/1 and 6/1 against Marquis, with Sir Lawrence Dundas's A-la-greque and Lord Rockingham's Cosmo both at 8/1. Goldfinder won this race and then beat Jethro again to win a Subscription of 50 guineas each a few days later. In his final two races as a five-year-old he walked over for a 150 guineas race and the Contribution Stakes.|$|R
50|$|PROCESSION OF THE SYMBOLS (procesione dei symboli): This Good Friday evening {{procession}} starts after mass at {{the main}} church, and proceeds slowly {{up and down the}} streets through town. It is led by a person covered in a pointed white hat and gown carrying the cross, followed by those carrying poles with the various symbols of Christ's crucifixion (hammer, nails, sponge, spear, pincers, <b>cup,</b> <b>whip,</b> etc), next a statue of Jesus lying on a coffin platform covered in a white gauze carried by pallbearers, then the priests and their entourage, then those carrying the crown of thorns and a regal crown, a statue of Mary covered in black with a black lace veil, the Honorable Society of Mary, (about 15 women dressed like Mary in black with long black lace veils, then a band of Italian accordions and guitars (nice to see that both older adults and teenagers were playing the accordions), then the procession. The stations of the cross were said by the priests, with megaphones, and along the street corners of Tollo, each of the 14 stations was laid out with either a cross with candles next to it, or the cross made out of candles {{in the middle of the}} street. Rhythmic chanting of the station, the crowd responses, and accompanied song, the procession includes those of all ages, including baby carriages and toddlers carried on daddy's shoulders. Along the street people had put out red candles to light the way, along curbs, balconies, and patios. It was beautiful and religious experience. The solemnity of the event makes us aware that we are part both of humanity and something larger. The event is attended by over 1,000. Afterwards, there are fireworks in the town square.|$|R
