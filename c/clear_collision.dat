40|$|The {{centrality}} {{dependence of}} pseudorapidity density of charged particles and transverse energy is studied {{for a wide}} range of collision energies for heavy-ion collisions at midrapidity from 7. 7 GeV to 5. 02 TeV. A two-component model approach has been adopted to quantify the soft and hard components of particle production, coming from nucleon participants and binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, respectively. Within experimental uncertainties, the hard component contributing to the particle production has been found not to show any <b>clear</b> <b>collision</b> energy dependence from RHIC to LHC. The effect of centrality and collision energy in particle production seem to factor out with some degree of dependency on the collision species. The collision of Uranium-like deformed nuclei opens up new challenges in understanding the energy-centrality factorization, which is evident from the centrality dependence of transverse energy density, when compared to collision of symmetric nuclei.

40|$|Loss of {{attention}} with time-on-task reflects the increasing instability of the waking state during performance in experimentally induced sleepiness. To determine whether patients with disorders of excessive sleepiness also displayed time-on-task decrements indicative of wake state instability, visual sustained attention performance on "Steer Clear," a computerized simple RT driving simulation task, was compared among 31 patients with untreated sleep apnea, 16 patients with narcolepsy, and 14 healthy control subjects. Vigilance decrement functions were generated {{by analyzing the}} number of collisions in each of six four-minute periods of Steer Clear task performance in a mixed-model analysis of variance and linear regression equations. As expected, patients had more Steer <b>Clear</b> <b>collisions</b> than control subjects (p= 0. 006). However, the inter-subject variability in errors among the narcoleptic patients was four-fold that of the apnea patients, and 100 -fold that of the controls volunteers; the variance in errors among untreated apnea patients was 27 -times that of controls. The results of transformed collision data revealed main effects for group (p= 0. 006), time-on-task (p= 0. 001), and a significant interaction (p= 0. 022). Control subjects showed no clear evidence of increasing collision errors with time-on-task (adjusted R 2 = 0. 22), while apnea patients showed a trend toward vigilance decrement (adjusted R 2 = 0. 42, p= 0. 097), and narcolepsy patients evidenced a robust linear vigilance decrement (adjusted R 2 = 0. 87, p= 0. 004). The association of disorders of excessive somnolence with escalating time-on-task decrements makes it imperative that when assessment of neurobehavioral performance is conducted in patients, it involves task durations and analyses that will evaluate the underlying vulnerability of potentially sleepy patients to decrements over time in tasks that require sustained attention and timely responses, {{both of which are}} key components in safe driving performance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} a {{solution}} for autonomous agent navigation in unknown virtual environments. A new decision making method using fuzzy logic is proposed. The objective is to solve behaviour conflicts in behaviour-based architectures. Two main problems have been identified: how to decide which behaviour should be activated at each instant; and how to combine the results from different behaviours into one action. The method uses fuzzy α-levels to compute behaviour weights for each behaviour and the final action is selected using the Hurwicz criterion. The experimental {{results show that the}} autonomous virtual agent had successfully navigated various virtual environments. The results show the virtual agent required less decision making which means more reliable decisions had been generated and redundant decisions had been reduced.

40|$|A {{real time}} traffic control tool was {{developed}} for safe route navigation of vessels in the Strait of Istanbul. Using channel geometry, bathymetry, counter traffic, and surface currents as input, the model simulates possible maneuvers according to probable hydrodynamic conditions. The decision making algorithm starts after computing the probable trajectory tree of the vessel by forward-mapping its position distribution with respect to an initial position vector. The proposed software tool uses an experimentally verified container ship model and a proportional-derivative (PD) auto-pilot to represent the captain’s response. Two different algorithms are used for cases with and without <b>clear</b> and present <b>collision</b> risk. For both cases, the route with minimum casualty risk is found. In case of multiple “quasi-risky ” routes, some safety based tie-breaker criteria are taken into account.

40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{mesoscale}} resolution and coupling between flow-field information and the evolution of particle properties in high-shear granulation. We have developed a modelling framework that compartmentalizes the high-shear granulation process based on relevant process parameters in time and space.

A Diosna high-shear mixer was modelled with microcrystalline cellulose powder as the granulation material. An analysis of the flow-field solution and compartmentalization allows for a resolution of the stress and collision peak at the impeller blades. Different compartmentalizations showed the importance of resolving the impeller region, for aggregating systems and systems with breakage.

40|$|This {{proposal}} outlines {{a program}} of scientific research and educational development focused on radiative forcing and climate. The scientific program consists of determining the role of three gaseous species in closing Earth’s energy budget and in radiatively forcing present and future climate. The gases are water vapor, collision complexes of oxygen (O 2 ·X), and nitrogen dioxide. Absorption by these gases has heretofore been oversimplified or neglected in large scale atmospheric models, so their radiative forcing and climate impact remain uncertain. By representing these missing absorption processes, this project will directly improve predictions of atmospheric heating, estimates of Earth’s energy budget, and, likely, the accuracy of climate predictions. Oversimplifications in current representations of H 2 O, O 2 ·X, and NO 2 in large scale models are known and will be reduced or eliminated. First, water vapor absorption of solar and terrestrial radiation in cloudy atmospheres is systematically underestimated and biased by neglecting the sub-gridscale partitioning of vapor between the saturated cloud and the sub-saturated <b>clear</b> sky. Second, <b>collision</b> complexes of oxygen absorb about 1 W m− 2 globally annually averaged, but the climate response to this forcing is unknown.

40|$|The {{number of}} ungulate-vehicle {{collisions}} has increased substantially {{over the last}} few decades. To reduce the number of accidents several mitigation measures have been implemented, but there is in many cases no evaluation of their collision preventive effect. By analysing moose (Alces alces) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) collision data from 2009 2015, I evaluated the effect of roadside vegetation clearing conducted in 2011 and 2012 in Nord-Trøndelag in central Norway. In the cleared areas I expected a substantial decrease in collision probability in the year after a clearing, followed by a slow increase as the vegetation re-emerged. I found that for both species the probability of a collision was substantially higher in cleared versus uncleared areas, indicating that the areas with high risk of collisions are targeted for vegetation clearing. However, the results revealed no {{reduction in the number of}} roe deer and moose <b>collisions</b> following <b>clearing,</b> indicating that vegetation <b>clearing</b> has no <b>collision</b> preventive effect. For moose, I found the number of <b>collisions</b> on <b>cleared</b> and uncleared stretches to be synchronised among years, and that the annual growth in collision numbers and snow depth were positively correlated.

40|$|In 1871, {{during his}} presidential {{address to the}} British Association in Edinburgh, Sir William Thompson (later Lord Kelvin) {{discussed}} the impact of two Earth-like bodies, asserting that "when two great masses come into collision in space, {{it is certain that}} a large part of each is melted" [see Arrhenius (1908, p. 218) for the complete quotation]. Although he did not go on to speculate about lunar origin, it must have been remarkable to see one of the creators of the bastions of nineteenth century conservative science discuss such an apocalyptic event and the debris issuing from it. It is equally remarkable that until recently, lunar origin myths have usually centered around three possibilities (fission, capture, and binary accretion) that exclude any important role for giant impacts. The Origin of the Moon Conference held in Kona, Hawaii, on October 13 - 16, 1984, saw a megaimpact hypothesis of lunar origin emerge as a strong contender, not because of any dramatic new development or infusion of data, but because the hypothesis was given serious and sustained attention for the first time. The resulting bandwagon has picked up speed (and some have hastened to jump aboard). Most significantly, efforts have been made to simulate giant impacts using three-dimensional hydrodynamic codes on supercomputers. Although all this effort is promising, a sober reflection on the problem after two years suggests that a lot more work is needed.

Between 1000 - 1500 clouds are created in the simulations with masses M > 10 ^ 5 Msolar and 180 - 240 with masses M > 10 ^ 6 Msolar in agreement with estimates of the Milky Way's population. We find {{that the effect of}} photoelectric heating is to suppress the fragmentation of the ISM, resulting in a filamentary structure in the warm gas surrounding clouds. This environment suppresses the formation of a retrograde rotating cloud population, with 88 % of the clouds rotating prograde with respect to the galaxy after 300 Myr. The diffuse heating also reduces the initial star formation rate, slowing the conversation of gas into stars. We therefore conclude that the interstellar environment {{plays an important role in}} the GMCs evolution. Our clouds live between 0 - 20 Myr with a high infant mortality (t' < 3 Myr) due to cloud mergers and star formation.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the orbital evolution of particles in a planet's chaotic zone {{to determine their}} final destinations and their timescales of clearing. There are four possible final states of chaotic particles: collision with the planet, collision with the star, escape, or bounded but non-collision orbits. In our investigations, {{within the framework of}} the planar circular restricted three body problem for planet-star mass ratio μ in the range 10 ^- 9 to 10 ^- 1. 5, we find no particles hitting the star. The relative frequencies of escape and collision with the planet are not scale-free, as they depend upon the size of the planet. For planet radius R_p> 0. 001 R_H where R_H is the planet's Hill radius, we find that most chaotic zone particles collide with the planet for μ≲ 10 ^- 5; particle scattering to large distances is significant only for higher mass planets. For fixed ratio R_p/R_H, the particle clearing timescale, T_cl, has a broken power-law dependence on μ. A shallower power-law, T_cl∼μ^- 1 / 3, prevails at small μ where particles are <b>cleared</b> primarily by <b>collisions</b> with the planet; a steeper power law, T_cl∼μ^- 3 / 2, prevails at larger μ where scattering dominates the particle loss.
