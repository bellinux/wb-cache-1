40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to evaluate antinutritive value of <b>chestnut</b> <b>fruit</b> silage in combination with various level of cassava meal addition and time of fermentation. The study was conducted for 8 month at Ratulodong countryside, district of Tanjung Bunga and at Nutrition and Fodder Laboratory. This experiment was conducted in 2 treatment factors with 3 replication. The first factor was various level of cassava meal e. i. 0, 3, 6, and 9 %, and the second factor was time of fermentation e. i. 20, 40, and 60 days. The result showed that silage technonogy with various cassava meal level and fermentation time significantly (P< 0. 01) decreased antinutritive value of <b>chestnut</b> <b>fruit.</b> Tannin content decreased in line with increasing level of cassava meal and time of fermentation. Higher tannin at 0 % cassava meal with fermentation time of 20 days (0. 35 %), and lower at 3 % cassava meal with fermentation time of 40 days (0. 06 %). The highest phytic acid content at 9 % cassava meal with fermentation time of 40 days (5. 48 %), and the lowest at 6 % cassava meal with fermentation time of 20 days (2. 38 %). Tannin and phytic acid content were decreased during fermentation process and lower than fresh <b>fruit</b> <b>chestnut.</b> It could be concluded that silage technonogy could be applied at <b>chestnut</b> <b>fruit.</b> This technology increased the benefit of <b>chestnut</b> <b>fruit</b> as feed ingredient because it decreased antinutritive value.

40|$|ABSTRACT — The granulovirus of {{codling moth}}, Cydia pomonella L., CpGV, is now com-mercialized for codling moth control in pome fruit in the USA and Canada. It is highly spe-cific for codling moth and related species. Comparative assays of CpGV against neonate larvae of another {{introduced}} tortricid pest, the oriental <b>fruit</b> <b>moth,</b> Grapholita molesta Busck, revealed a 557 and 589 fold lower susceptibility of neonate larvae {{compared with the}} LC 50 and LC 95 values derived for C. pomonella. Since its introduction into North America, the oriental <b>fruit</b> <b>moth,</b> Grapholita molesta Busck, has become a widely established pest of peach, nectarine, apricot, and apple (Rothschild and Vickers 1991). There is little information regarding naturally occurring disease of the oriental <b>fruit</b> <b>moth,</b> {{with the exception of}} mi-crosporidia in adults (Simchuk and Komarova 1983) and Bacillus thuringiensis in larva...|$|R

40|$|Black rot, {{induced by}} Rachodiella castaneae Pyr. [teleomorph: Sclerotinia pseudotuberosa Rehm.; syn. Ciboria batschiana (Zopf) Buchw. ], and the {{chestnut}} weevil [Curculio propinquus (Desbr.) ] {{are among the}} most serious phytosanitary problems of the chest- nut (Castanea sativa Mill.) fruit industry in Italy, causing relevant economic losses at harvest and during storage. Symptoms of black rot are frequent in nuts infested by C. propinquus, and hence an association between the fungus and the insect has been hypothesised. To verify this hypothesis, clusters of immature burrs from three trees in a chestnut area in Central Italy were covered with a net and treated as follow: (i) infested with C. propinquus adults that had been artificially contaminated with R. castaneae; (ii) infested with C. propinquus uncontaminated adults; (iii) uninfested negative control. At harvest time, the nets were re- moved and the adults of the insects and <b>chestnut</b> <b>fruits</b> were col- lected. Due to the inefficacy of traditional diagnostic methods, the detection R. castaneae in C. propinquus and in <b>chestnut</b> <b>fruits</b> was performed by PCR. Two sequences specific for R. castaneae were identified in the ITS region of rDNA, and two species-spe- cific primers (RAC 1 and RAC 2) were designed. R. castaneae was detected in more than 90 % of the chestnut weevils analysed, re- gardless the treatment, and in 77, 73, and 92 % of nuts following the treatments (i), (ii) and (iii), respectively. These findings sug- gest an endophytic habitus of R. castaneae in <b>chestnut</b> <b>fruits</b> and that C. propinquus is a potential vector of the pathogen...|$|R
50|$|Chestnuts {{depart from}} the norm for culinary nuts in that they have very little protein or fat, their {{calories}} coming chiefly from carbohydrates.

40|$|Chestnuts are an {{important}} economic resource in the chestnut growing regions, {{not only for the}} fruit, but also for the wood. The content of ellagic acid (EA), a naturally occurring inhibitor of carcinogenesis, was determined in <b>chestnut</b> <b>fruits</b> and bark. EA was extracted with methanol and free ellagic acid was determined by HPLC with UV detection, both in the crude extract and after hydrolysis. The concentration of EA was generally increased after hydrolysis due to the presence of ellagitannins in the crude extract. The concentration varied between 0. 71 and 21. 6 ing g(- 1) (d. w.) in un-hydrolyzed samples, and between 2. 83 and 18. 4 mg g(- 1) (d. w.) ill hydrolyzed samples. In <b>chestnut</b> <b>fruits,</b> traces of EA were present in the seed, with higher concentrations in the pellicle and pericarp. However, all fruit tissues had lower concentrations of EA than had the bark. The concentration of EA in the hydrolyzed samples showed a non-linear correlation with the concentration in the unhydrolyzed extracts. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Apple <b>fruit</b> <b>moth</b> Argyresthia conjugella is a {{specialist}} seed predator of rowan Sorbus aucuparia. Large-scale synchronous fluctuation of seed production in rowan (i. e. named masting) drives the apple <b>fruit</b> <b>moth</b> to seek alternative host {{plants such as}} apple, during years when rowan berries are not available for oviposition. The role of plant volatile compounds in the attraction of gravid apple <b>fruit</b> <b>moth</b> females is studied in a laboratory wind tunnel. Volatiles from rowan branches with green berries stimulate female moths to fly upwind and to land at the odour source. By contrast, females are not attracted to rowan branches without green berries, {{and they are not}} attracted to apple, demonstrating that the chemical stimulus from rowan berries is required for attraction. Attraction to synthetic compounds identified from rowan, anethole and 2 -phenyl ethanol confirms the role of plant volatiles in host finding. These two compounds, however, show a discrepant behavioural effect in wind tunnel and field tests. Field traps baited with 2 -phenyl ethanol capture female moths but anethole does not produce significant captures. Wind tunnel tests produce the opposite results: moths fly upwind towards the anethole lure, whereas 2 -phenyl ethanol is not attractive at all. Wind tunnel attraction to 2 -phenyl ethanol is achieved by adding odour from a rowan branch without berries, which is not attractive on its own. This finding demonstrates that interaction with the background odour contributes to the behavioural effect of plant volatile stimuli in the field...|$|R
