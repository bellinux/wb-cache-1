5|$|The {{composition}} of the electrode core is generally similar and sometimes identical {{to that of the}} base material. But even though a number of feasible options exist, a slight difference in alloy composition can strongly impact the properties of the resulting weld. This is especially true of alloy steels such as HSLA steels. Likewise, electrodes of compositions {{similar to those of the}} base materials are often used for welding nonferrous materials like aluminium and copper. However, sometimes it is desirable to use electrodes with core materials significantly different from the base material. For example, stainless steel electrodes are sometimes used to weld two pieces of <b>carbon</b> <b>steel,</b> and are often utilized to weld stainless steel workpieces with <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> workpieces.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of medium <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> as engineering materials is {{reflected by the}} fact that out of the vast majority of engineering grade ferrous alloys available and used in the market today, a large proportion of them are from the family of medium <b>carbon</b> <b>steels.</b> Typically medium <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> have a <b>carbon</b> range of 0. 25 to 0. 65 % by weight, and a manganese content ranging from 0. 060 to 1. 65 % by weight. Medium <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> are more resistive to cutting, welding and forming as compared to low <b>carbon</b> <b>steels.</b> From the last two decades a number of research scholars reported the use of verity of heat treatments to tailor the properties of medium <b>carbon</b> <b>steels.</b> Spheroidizing is the novel industrial heat treatment employed to improve formability and machinability of medium/high <b>carbon</b> low alloy <b>steels.</b> This exclusive study covers procedure, the effects and possible outcomes of various heat treatments on medium <b>carbon</b> <b>steels.</b> In the present work, other related heat treatments like annealing and special treatments for property alterations which serve as pretreatments for spheroidizing are also reviewed. Medium <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> with property alterations by various heat treatment processes are finding increased responsiveness in transportation, aerospace, space, underwater along with other variegated fields. Improved tribological and mechanical properties consisting of impact resistance, stiffness, abrasion and strength are the main reasons for the increased attention of these steels in various industries. In the present scenario for the consolidation of important aspects of various heat treatments and effects on mechanical properties of medium <b>carbons</b> <b>steel,</b> a review of different research papers has been attempted.

5|$|Modern steels {{are made}} with varying {{combinations}} of alloy metals to fulfill many purposes. <b>Carbon</b> <b>steel,</b> composed simply of iron and carbon, accounts for 90% of steel production. Low alloy steel is alloyed with other elements, usually molybdenum, manganese, chromium, or nickel, in amounts of up to 10% by weight to improve the hardenability of thick sections. High strength low alloy steel has small additions (usually < 2% by weight) of other elements, typically 1.5% manganese, to provide additional strength for a modest price increase.|$|E

5|$|Chromium metal left {{standing}} in air is passivated by oxidation, forming a thin, protective, surface layer. This layer is a spinel structure {{only a few}} molecules thick. It is very dense, and prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying metal. This {{is different from the}} oxide that forms on iron and <b>carbon</b> <b>steel,</b> through which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching the underlying material to cause incessant rusting. Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a strong reducing agent that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.|$|E
5|$|Mild steel corrodes {{more readily}} than wrought iron, but is cheaper and more widely available. <b>Carbon</b> <b>steel</b> {{contains}} 2.0% carbon or less, with small amounts of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. Alloy steels contain varying amounts of carbon {{as well as other}} metals, such as chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses. One common alloy steel, though, is stainless steel. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.|$|E
5|$|The {{carbon content}} of steel is between 0.002% and 2.14% by weight for plain ironcarbon alloys. These values vary {{depending}} on alloying elements such as manganese, chromium, nickel, iron, tungsten, carbon and so on. Basically, steel is an iron-carbon alloy that does not undergo eutectic reaction. In contrast, cast iron does undergo eutectic reaction. Too little carbon content leaves (pure) iron quite soft, ductile, and weak. Carbon contents {{higher than those of}} steel make an alloy, commonly called pig iron, that is brittle (not malleable). While iron alloyed with carbon is called <b>carbon</b> <b>steel,</b> alloy steel is steel to which other alloying elements have been intentionally added to modify the characteristics of steel. Common alloying elements include: manganese, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, boron, titanium, vanadium, tungsten, cobalt, and niobium. Additional elements are also important in steel: phosphorus, sulfur, silicon, and traces of oxygen, nitrogen, and copper, that are most frequently considered undesirable.|$|E

5|$|Evidence of the {{earliest}} production of high <b>carbon</b> <b>steel</b> in the Indian Subcontinent are found in Kodumanal in Tamil Nadu area, Golconda in Andhra Pradesh area and Karnataka, and in Samanalawewa areas of Sri Lanka. This {{came to be known}} as Wootz steel, produced in South India by about sixth century BC and exported globally. The steel technology existed prior to 326 BC in the region as they are mentioned in literature of Sangam Tamil, Arabic and Latin as the finest steel in the world exported to the Romans, Egyptian, Chinese and Arab worlds at that time – what they called Seric Iron. A 200 BC Tamil trade guild in Tissamaharama, in the South East of Sri Lanka, brought with them some of the oldest iron and steel artifacts and production processes to the island from the classical period. The Chinese and locals in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka had also adopted the production methods of creating Wootz steel from the Chera Dynasty Tamils of South India by the 5th century AD. In Sri Lanka, this early steel-making method employed a unique wind furnace, driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing high-carbon steel. Since the technology was acquired from the Tamilians from South India, the origin of steel technology in India can be conservatively estimated at 400–500 BC.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>steel</b> {{cookware}} can {{be rolled}} or hammered into relatively thin sheets of dense material, which provides robust strength and improved heat distribution. <b>Carbon</b> <b>steel</b> accommodates high, dry heat for such operations as dry searing. <b>Carbon</b> <b>steel</b> does not conduct heat efficiently, {{but this may}} be an advantage for larger vessels, such as woks and paella pans, where one portion of the pan is intentionally kept at a different temperature than the rest.

Three types of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) flow behaviors were identified, namely single peak, multiple transient steady state (MTSS), and cyclic behaviors. The normalized critical stress (and strain) {{for the low}} and medium <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> were about 0. 846 (0. 531) and 0. 879 (0. 537), respectively. For both steels, the apparent deformation activation energy {{and the power of}} the hyperbolic sine law were found to be near the lattice self-diffusion activation energy of austenite (270 kJ/mol) and 4. 5, respectively. As a result, it was concluded that the flow stress of plain <b>carbon</b> <b>steels</b> in hot deformation is mainly controlled by dislocation climb during their intragranular motion, and based on physically-based constitutive analysis, it was found that carbon has a slight effect on the hot flow stress of plain <b>carbon</b> <b>steels.</b> The significance of the approach used in this work was shown to be its reliance on the theoretical analysis based on the deformation mechanisms, which makes the comparison more reliable.
