This is known as Newton's theory of colour.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd {{recorded}} The Dark Side of the Moon between May 1972 and January 1973, with EMI staff engineer Alan Parsons at Abbey Road. The {{title is}} {{an allusion to}} lunacy rather than astronomy. The band had composed and refined the material on Dark Side while touring the UK, Japan, North America and Europe. Producer Chris Thomas assisted Parsons. Hipgnosis designed the album's packaging, which included George Hardie's iconic refracting prism design on the cover. Thorgerson's Dark Side album cover features a beam of white light, representing unity, passing through a prism, which represents society. The resulting refracted beam of <b>coloured</b> <b>light</b> symbolises unity diffracted, leaving an absence of unity. Waters is the sole author of the album's lyrics.|$|E

25|$|Notable {{events that}} have {{happened}} to Croydon's skyline include the Millennium project to create the largest single urban lighting project ever. It was created for the buildings of Croydon to illuminate them for the third millennium. Not only did this project give new lighting to the buildings, but it provided an opportunity to project onto them images and words, mixing art and poetry with <b>coloured</b> <b>light,</b> and also displaying public information after dark. Apart from increasing night time activity in Croydon and thereby reducing the fear of crime, it helped to promote the sustainable use of older buildings by displaying them in a more positive way.|$|E
25|$|Isaac Newton {{investigated}} the refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism could decompose white light into {{a spectrum of}} colours, and that a lens and a second prism could recompose the multicoloured spectrum into white light. He also showed that the <b>coloured</b> <b>light</b> does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects. Newton noted that {{regardless of whether it}} was reflected or scattered or transmitted, it stayed the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour. From this work he concluded that any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours. The interest of the Royal Society encouraged him to publish his notes On Colour (later expanded into Opticks). Newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles and were refracted by accelerating toward the denser medium, but he had to associate them with waves to explain the diffraction of light.|$|E

25|$|Isaac Newton (1643–1727) {{investigated}} the refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism could decompose white light into {{a spectrum of}} colours, and that a lens and a second prism could recompose the multicoloured spectrum into white light. He also showed that the <b>coloured</b> <b>light</b> does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects.

Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour. From this work he concluded that any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours, and invented a reflecting telescope (today known as a Newtonian telescope) to bypass that problem. By grinding his own mirrors, using Newton's rings to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes, he was able to produce a superior instrument to the refracting telescope, due primarily to the wider diameter of the mirror. In 1671 the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes On Colour, which he later expanded into his Opticks. Newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles and were refracted by accelerating toward the denser medium, but he had to associate them with waves to explain the diffraction of light (Opticks Bk. II, Props. XII-L). Later physicists instead favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for diffraction. Today's quantum mechanics, photons and the idea of wave-particle duality bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.|$|E

The beetle larva has four instar stages. [...] The head remains black throughout these stages, but the pronotum changes colour from black in first- and second-instar larvae to having an orange-brown edge in its third-instar. In fourth-instar larvae, about half the pronotum is <b>coloured</b> <b>light</b> brown. This tribe is characterised within the subfamily by round to oval shaped convex bodies which are usually brightly coloured, simple claws which separate at the base, open cavities behind the procoxae, and a variable apicial segment of the maxillary palp.|$|E

40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{efficient}} saturated LED sources, {{we are seeing a}} rise in the application of <b>coloured</b> <b>lighting</b> as a provider of ambience. To perceive colour means to ‘experience’ it. The factors that influence this process, on a conscious but also to some extent on a subconscious level, are discussed below. These have been inspired by Frank H. Mahnke’s categorization in his ‘colour experience’ pyramid, which describes the effects of <b>coloured</b> <b>lighting</b> on mood and wellbeing. These effects range from conscious, personal and temporary ones to more subconscious, biological and long-term effects...|$|R

2500|$|To {{coordinate}} signals {{so that it}} {{is impossible}} to give a [...] "clear" [...] signal to a train unless the route is actually clear, the signals could be interlocked. An interlocked yard is a railway yard where semaphore or <b>coloured</b> <b>light</b> signals are controlled in such a way that the signals will not allow a train to proceed unless the points that operate in conjunction with the signals are correctly set. A mechanical interlocking device, located under a mechanical signal frame, is a system of rods, sliding bars and levers that are configured so that points cannot be changed in conflict, thus preventing movements that may cause a collision or other accident.|$|E

The hypothesis was tested for sound waves by Buys Ballot in 1845. He confirmed that the sound's pitch was higher than the emitted frequency when the sound source approached him, and lower than the emitted frequency when the sound source receded from him. Hippolyte Fizeau discovered independently the same phenomenon on electromagnetic waves in 1848 (in France, the effect is sometimes called [...] "effet Doppler-Fizeau" [...] but that name was not adopted {{by the rest of}} the world as Fizeau's discovery was six years after Doppler's proposal). In Britain, John Scott Russell made an experimental study of the Doppler effect (1848).|$|E

2500|$|While Scriabin wrote only a {{small number}} of orchestral works, they are among his most famous, and some are {{performed}} frequently. They include a piano concerto (1896), and five symphonic works, including three numbered symphonies as well as The Poem of Ecstasy (1908) and [...] (1910), which includes a part for a machine known as a [...] "clavier à lumières", known also as a Luce (Italian for [...] "Light"), which was a colour organ designed specifically for the performance of Scriabin's tone poem. It was played like a piano, but projected <b>coloured</b> <b>light</b> on a screen in the concert hall rather than sound. Most performances of the piece (including the premiere) have not included this light element, although a performance in New York City in 1915 projected colours onto a screen. It has been claimed erroneously that this performance used the colour-organ invented by English painter A. Wallace Rimington when in fact it was a novel construction supervised personally and built in New York specifically for the performance by Preston S. Miller, the president of the Illuminating Engineering Society.|$|E
