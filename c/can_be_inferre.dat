40|$|The central {{sector of}} the {{northern}} foreland margin of the Guadalquivir Basin shows good examples of transgressive erosion surfaces, recognisable along all its extension. In the studied area (Villanueva del Rio y Minas, Sevilla) theses surfaces allow us to identify different erosion levels and various morphological structures linked to such surfaces. According to: i) the transgressive deposits related to these relieves, ii) the types of materials that these surfaces have associated (sediments or substratum) and, iii) its topographic elevation, we can link these geomorphologic structures (“plataformas”, “mesas” y “cuestas”) to a transgressed sedimentary environment, such as a rocky shoreline or a sandy-gravel beach.

40|$|Abstract. Gamma rays in {{the band}} from 20 MeV to 300 GeV, used in {{combination}} with data from radio and X-ray bands, provide {{a powerful tool for}} studying the origin of cosmic rays in our sister galaxies Andromeda and the Magellanic Clouds. Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) will spatially resolve these galaxies and measure the spectrum and intensity of diffuse gamma radiation from the collisions of cosmic rays with gas and dust in them. Observations of Andromeda will give an external perspective on a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way. Observations of the Magellanic Clouds will permit a study of cosmic rays in dwarf irregular galaxies, where the confinement is certainly different and the massive star formation rate is much greater.

The results are obtained by a method that had proven useful {{in the past to}} study Calabi-Yau moduli spaces for more than one parameter, and exploits the relation between monodromy and braid groups for algebraic surfaces. A better grasp on nonperturbative aspects of supersymmetric gauge theories has been reached after the observation that the quantum moduli space for the abelian phase of a G invariant N = 2 rigid gauge theory can be characterized in terms of a class of genus r = rank G hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces Σ r, parametrized by r complex moduli, and informations on the electromagnetic duality symmetries of the theory can be extracted from the monodromy group of Σ r 1 Γ 3.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the significance of cell death in the formation of neural circuits, it is necessary to determine whether before cell death neurons have (a) sent axons to the periphery; (b) reached the proper target organs; and (c) have established synaptic connections with them. Axon counts demonstrated that, after sending out initial axons, ciliary cells sprouted numerous collaterals at the time of peripheral synapse formation. Subsequently, large numbers of axons were lost from the nerves, slightly later than the onset of ganglion cell death. A secondary loss of collaterals later occurred unaccompanied by cell death. Measurements of conduction velocity and axon diameters indicated that all ganglion cell axons grew down the proper pathways from the start, but {{it was not possible to}} determine whether all axons had actually formed proper synapses. This was ascertained, however, in the ganglion itself where preganglionic fibres were shown to synapse selectively with all ganglion cells before cell death.

40|$|Abstract. The recent {{downward}} {{revision of}} the solar CNO photospheric abundances now leads to severe inconsistencies between theoretical models for the Sun’s internal structure {{and the results of}} helioseismology. There have been claims that the solar Ne abundance may be underestimated and that an increase in this ill-defined quantity could alleviate (or even completely solve) this problem. To address the validity of this hypothesis, we present a fully homogeneous non-LTE abundance analysis of the optical Ne I/II lines in a sample of 18 nearby B-type stars. Our very preliminary results point towards a mean neon abundance slightly higher than the new solar value, but apparently insufficient by itself to restore the agreement between the solar models and the helioseismological constraints. 1. Neon and the ’solar model crisis’ Recent state-of-the-art spectral analyses have led to a downward {{revision of the}} solar CNO abundances [1], which greatly affects the opacities in the solar interior and no longer leads to a satisfactory agreement between theoretical models for the Sun and the results of helioseismology (e. g. convection zone predicted too shallow).

40|$|Abstract. A {{great deal}} of psycholinguistic {{research}} has focused on the question of how adults interpret language in real time. This work has revealed a complex and interactive language processing system capable of rapidly coordinating linguistic properties of the message with information from the situation or context [e. g., 1 - 7]. In the study of language acquisition, however, surprisingly little is known about how children interpret language in real time, in large part because most existing techniques have relied upon the adult skill of reading [8, 9]. We present here results from a new method for studying children’s language processing abilities, in which a head-mounted eyetracking system was used to monitor eye movements as subjects responded to spoken instructions. The results revealed systematic differences in how children and adults process spoken language: Five year olds relied heavily on the linguistic properties of the input, showing less ability or inclination than adults to coordinate these properties with information from the visual context. This finding suggests that an important component of human development is acquiring the capacity to rapidly coordinate information generated from multiple perceptual and cognitive systems. Recent developments in miniaturized eye-tracking technology have permitted us to establish a new method for studying spoken language comprehension in children.

40|$|Summary. -Evidence is {{presented}} {{which indicates that}} S-(1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydro- 2 -hydroxy-l-naphthyl) -L-cysteine (THN-cysteine), formed by the reaction of 1, 2 -epoxy-THN with cysteine, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> incorporated into protein. The position of incor-poration of THN-cysteine into protein would depend on whether the epoxide of THN reacts with cysteinyl-tRNACYs or with cysteine. In both cases, the mechanism of incorporation of THN-cysteine into protein {{is the same as}} for the natural amino acids. For example, the incorporation of THN-cysteinyl-tRNACYs is stimulated by Poly-UG, the code for tRNACys, and would be expected to be substituted for cysteine in protein being synthesized, whereas THN-cysteine not previously esterified to tRNA is activated by the isoleucyl- and valyl-RNA synthetases, and its incorporation is stimulated by Poly-AU and Poly-UG, respectively. Conse-quently, in this case, THN-cysteine would substitute for isoleucine and valine during protein synthesis.

40|$|Various studies report {{substantial}} {{increases in}} intrinsic water-use efficiency (W i), estimated using carbon isotopes in tree rings, suggesting trees are gaining increasingly more carbon per unit water lost due {{to increases in}} atmospheric CO 2. Usually, reconstructions do not, however, correct for the effect of intrinsic developmental changes in W i as trees grow larger. Here we show, by comparing W i across varying tree sizes at one CO 2 level, that ignoring such developmental effects can severely affect inferences of trees’ W i. W i doubled or even tripled over a trees’ lifespan in three broadleaf species due to changes in tree height and light availability alone, {{and there are also}} weak trends for Pine trees.

The release of aqueous fluids during crystallization of the silicic intrusions resulted in widespread hydrothermal activity leading to skarn formation and locally to ore deposition in the contact aureoles. Stable isotope and fluid inclusion data {{have been used}} to constrain the composition and evolution of skarn-form-ing fluids at a roof pendant situated on the eastern margin of the large Nordmarkite (syenite) batholith at the eastern margin of the Oslo rift.

Oxygen and hydrogen isotope data from biotite and quartz from the intrusive rocks and oxygen isotope zonation profiles across relict carbonate layers in areas characterized by pervasive stage I skarn formation indicate early infiltration of magmatic fluids with 8 D =- 30 to- 60 per mil and 8 •sO = 5 to 8. 5 per mil, followed by infiltration of fluids with a significant meteoric component (8 •sO = 0 - 2 % 0).

An infield vehicle {{was developed to}} automatically convey the machine vision system across the crop canopy. This paper presents {{an evaluation of the}} devised system under a range of operational and field conditions. On average, the vision system's internode length detection rate ranged from 12 measurements per 100 plants for compact plants when the sun was directly overhead with respect to the camera, to 64 measurements per 100 plants for vigorous plants when the sunlight was perpendicular to the camera view angle. Imaging at night time using 850 nm near infrared illumination resulted in internode length detection rates not significantly different from the most reliable daylight conditions. Both across-row and along-row operations of the system were evaluated, with the system yielding internode length measurements for groundspeeds up to 0. 20 m/s for along-row operation. Visual occlusion of the main stem nodes by foliage and variations in natural lighting conditions were observed to be the principal reasons for internode lengths not being successfully detected for every plant. However, from the success rates observed it is concluded that the system has the practical capability to extensively map internode length across a field and hence, identify spatial trends in internode length from which spatial trends in plant water stress may <b>be</b> <b>inferre...</b>|$|R

While the solar photospheric luminosity was about 30 % lower 4. 6 Gyr {{ago when the}} Sun arrived on the main sequence compared to present-day levels, its faster rotation generated enhanced {{magnetic activity}}; magnetic heating processes in the chromosphere, the transition region, and the corona induced ultraviolet, extreme-ultraviolet, and X-ray emission about 10, 100, and 1000 times, respectively, the present-day levels, as inferred from young solar-analog stars. Also, the production rate of accelerated, high-energy particles was orders of magnitude higher than in present-day solar flares, and a much stronger wind escaped from the Sun, permeating the entire solar system.

The physiological and metabolic adaptations of this tissue have been elegantly summarized {{in a recent}} review article by Pelster and Scheid (1992). There are two key contributors to {{the function of the}} gland. First, a specialized metabolism of the swim bladder, involving copious and simultaneous production of lactate and CO 2 from anaerobic glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (also known as the hexose monophosphate shunt), respectively, contributes to gas exchange through pH and salting-out effects on the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Second, a countercurrent multiplier system (i. e. a rete mirabile) enables gas tensions to be elevated further by back diffusion. Several features of metabolism and acid–base physiology remain unclear. First, despite the remarkable ability of this tissue to produce acid, it is not clear if or how intracellular pH (pHi) is regulated. Since ultimately the blood must be acidified, one would predict that the pHi of the tissue would be well regulated viahigh rates of membrane exchange of protons and/or high tissue buffering capacity.
