40|$|Quercetin (Q), naringenin (N) and {{epicatechin}} (E) were encapsulated with inulin (In) as encapsulating {{agent and}} Capsul (C) as <b>channelizing</b> agent by spray drying and applying a Box-Behnken design. Q-In, N-In, E-In, Q-In-C, N-In-C and E-In-C were characterised by encapsulating efficiency (EE) and their release profile in methyl linoleate (ML). The flavonoid EE was significant higher (p<. 0. 05) for Q and E (over 60 %) than for N (≈. 40 %) in microparticles either without or with <b>channelizing</b> agent. An {{increase of the}} number of flavonoid hydroxyl groups enhanced EE, showing the influence of the flavonoid structural features. The release profile was fitted to Peppas and Higuchi mathematical models. The highest and lowest flavonoid release rate constants were found for N and E, respectively, for microparticles both with and without <b>channelizing</b> agent. The EE as indicator of flavonoid-inulin interaction was inversely related with the release rate constant in ML. Flavonoid release rate constant was significantly higher for microparticles with <b>channelizing</b> agent than for those without it, suggesting that Capsul induces the formation of channels inside the microparticles thus favoring the diffusion of flavonoids to ML. The mechanism of flavonoid release was only determined by <b>channelizing</b> agents, independently of the flavonoid nature, that is, Fickian and non-Fickian diffusion mechanisms in microparticles with and without Capsul, respectively. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|The Orange County Flood Control Act of 1927 {{was created}} in the wake of some of the earlier {{flooding}} events of this era. Dams and reservoirs, some of the largest of which include Irvine Lake and the Sulphur Creek Reservoir, were the first features to be constructed following the passage of this act. Starting from the 1960s, most Orange County rivers, including Aliso Creek, were <b>channelized.</b> Some, like the Santa Ana River, were entirely lined with concrete, but Aliso Creek retains a natural riverbed in most parts despite being bound to a narrow channel.|$|E

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{method is}} proposed for <b>channelizing</b> frequency division multiplexed (FDM) channels in wideband software radio (SWR) received signals {{that do not}} satisfy the conditions required for polyphase decomposition of the discrete filterbank (DFB) channelizer. The proposed method, which uses modulated perfect reconstruction (PR) filterbanks, requires fewer computations than DFBs for <b>channelizing</b> wideband signals that are composed of FDM channels of nonequal bandwidths, especially when {{a large number of}} channels are extracted. The proposed channelizer, if applied in the reverse direction, can be used to synthesize a set of channels with nonequal bandwidths into a single wideband signal in SWR transmitters. A method is also proposed for efficiently designing the modulated PR filterbanks, which have a large number of subchannels and prototype filters with high stopband attenuations that are used in the proposed channelizer. The computational complexity of the proposed channelizer is compared with the complexity of the DFB channelizer for <b>channelizing</b> the wideband and high-dynamic-range signals that are typical of SWR systems, and simulation results of the proposed channelization method are discussed...|$|R

5|$|The {{watershed}} of Keyser Creek was historically {{affected by}} coal mining {{and has been}} <b>channelized.</b> It has no flow in dry conditions, although it does have some during and after storms. As of 1991, the watershed is mostly forested. The first white settlers in Lackawanna County settled near the creek in 1769. Keyser Creek is a major second-order tributary of the Lackawanna River. Since 2013, a trailhead of the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail has been situated near the creek. A number of bridges have also been built across the creek.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, the {{watershed}} {{became part of}} a rancho. In 1966, the creek was dammed to form Laguna Niguel Lake, while the surrounding hills were leveled as residential communities were constructed in the area following the '60s and '70s.

Increasing urban runoff in the 1960s caused most of the flow in the creek to be unnatural. The creek has since been <b>channelized</b> along most of its length to prevent floods from inundating the roads and houses that now line much of its banks.|$|E

The creek's headwaters are in wetlands surrounded by residential development. There is riprap on the creek in Leggetts Gap as it flows near major highways in this stretch. It typically has a natural channel in part of its lower reaches {{and there are some}} reaches with gradual slopes. However, {{in some parts of the}} creek's lower reaches, fill has been dumped onto its banks, creating steep slopes. The creek has been <b>channelized</b> in South Abington Township.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper reaches}} of the {{watershed}} of Spring Brook are mountainous and swampy. Further downstream, the stream flows through a water gap in the Moosic Mountains. Sandstone, shale, and some coal are present {{in the vicinity of the}} stream. It has been <b>channelized</b> in a concrete channel for part of its length and is the main source of flooding in Spring Brook Township, Lackawanna County. The stream is the second-largest tributary of the Lackawanna River. Reservoirs on Spring Brook include the Spring Brook Intake, the Nesbitt Reservoir, the Watres Reservoir. There are three dams on the stream. The watershed is mainly forested, with only a small amount of urban land.|$|E
5|$|Uplift {{from the}} Laramide paused {{briefly in the}} Eocene. Meandering streams flowed slowly over the {{resulting}} broad and almost featureless plains. Periodic but extensive floods inundated large areas perhaps once every 1,000 years; spreading mud, cobbles and fine silt over the plains. Erosion incised these deposits between flood events and plant growth was abundant. Oxidation of the iron {{in the mud and}} silt turned the soil into hematite, giving it a pink and red hue. These sediments were later lithified into the up-to- -thick Pink Member of the locally Eocene-aged Claron Formation (previously called the Wasatch Formation). <b>Channelized</b> conglomerates of this member can be easily seen in Red Canyon along State Route 12 while its silt and mudstones compose most of the park's fragile and colorful spires called hoodoos.

40|$|This {{innovation}} is a compact, superconducting, <b>channelizing</b> bandpass filter on a single-crystal (0. 45 m thick) silicon substrate, which operates from 300 to 600 GHz. This device {{consists of four}} channels with center frequencies of 310, 380, 460, and 550 GHz, with approximately 50 -GHz bandwidth per channel. The filter concept is inspired by the mammalian cochlea, which is a <b>channelizing</b> filter that covers three decades of bandwidth and 3, 000 channels {{in a very small}} physical space. By using a simplified physical cochlear model, and its electrical analog of a <b>channelizing</b> filter covering multiple octaves bandwidth, a large number of output channels with high inter-channel isolation and high-order upper stopband response can be designed. A <b>channelizing</b> filter is a critical component used in spectrometer instruments that measure the intensity of light at various frequencies. This embodiment was designed for MicroSpec in order to increase the resolution of the instrument (with four channels, the resolution will be increased by a factor of four). MicroSpec is a revolutionary wafer-scale spectrometer that is intended for the SPICA (Space Infrared Telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics) Mission. In addition to being a vital component of MicroSpec, the <b>channelizing</b> filter itself is a low-resolution spectrometer when integrated with only an antenna at its input, and a detector at each channel s output. During the design process for this filter, the available characteristic impedances, possible lumped element ranges, and fabrication tolerances were identified for design on a very thin silicon substrate. Iterations between full-wave and lumped-element circuit simulations were performed. Each channel s circuit was designed based on the availability of characteristic impedances and lumped element ranges. This design was based on a tabular type bandpass filter with no spurious harmonic response. Extensive electromagnetic modeling for each channel was performed. Four channels, with 50 -GHz bandwidth, were designed, each using multiple transmission line media such as microstrip, coplanar waveguide, and quasi-lumped components on 0. 45 - m thick silicon. In the design process, modeling issues had to be overcome. Due to the extremely high frequencies, very thin Si substrate, and the superconducting metal layers, most commercially available software fails in various ways. These issues were mitigated by using alternative software that was capable of handling them at the expense of greater simulation time. The design of on-chip components for the filter characterization, such as a broadband antenna, Wilkinson power dividers, attenuators, detectors, and transitions has been completed...|$|R
