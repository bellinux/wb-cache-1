5|$|In {{the general}} election, Jones faced Republican Larry Hopkins, a seven-term congressman {{representing}} Kentucky's 6th congressional district. Hopkins {{was considered the}} Republicans' best hope of capturing the governorship since Louie B. Nunn in 1967. Instead, Hopkins' negative <b>campaign</b> <b>ads,</b> mistakes about his record, and involvement in a House scandal involving bounced checks all hurt his chances. Jones won the election {{by a vote of}} 540,468 to 294,542, the largest margin of victory in a Kentucky gubernatorial race.|$|E

5|$|Though Colbert's real-life presidential {{campaign}} had ended, Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Joe Quesada established {{in an interview}} on The Colbert Report that Colbert's campaign was still going strong in the fictional Marvel Universe, citing the cover art of a then-recent issue of The Amazing Spider-Man which featured a Colbert campaign billboard in the background. Background appearances of Colbert <b>campaign</b> <b>ads</b> continued to appear in Marvel Comics publications, as late as August 2008's Secret Invasion No. 5 (which also features a cameo of an alien Skrull posing as Colbert). In October 2008, Colbert made an extended 8-page appearance webslinging with Spider-Man in The Amazing Spider-Man issue No. 573. Colbert voiced the president of the U.S. in the 2009 film Monsters vs. Aliens.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, Brown again ran for governor, {{entering}} a crowded Democratic primary that included Lieutenant Governor Steve Beshear, former governor Julian Carroll, Grady Stumbo, and political newcomer Wallace Wilkinson. He entered the race late – filing his candidacy papers in late February before the primary election in late May. When Brown approached {{the state capitol}} to file his papers, Beshear met him outside the filing office and challenged him to an impromptu debate, but Brown declined. As Brown quickly became the frontrunner, Beshear attacked his lavish lifestyle {{in a series of}} <b>campaign</b> <b>ads,</b> one of which was based on the popular television show Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Other ads by Beshear played up Brown's ties to James P. Lambert, while still others claimed that Brown would raise taxes. Brown refuted Beshear's claims in ads of his own, and the battle between Beshear and Brown opened an opportunity for Wilkinson – who distinguished himself from the field by advocating for a state lottery – to make a late surge. He defeated Brown, his closest competitor, by a margin of 58,000 votes.|$|E

Corzine also released {{the first two}} television <b>campaign</b> <b>ads,</b> both were 30 second spots, released on January 5.

25|$|During the 2002 {{election}} campaign, Davis {{took the}} unusual step of taking out <b>campaign</b> <b>ads</b> during the Republican primaries against Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan. Davis claimed that Riordan had attacked his record {{and that his}} campaign was defending his record. Polls showed that, as a moderate, Riordan would be a more formidable challenger in the general election than a conservative candidate. Polls even showed that Riordan would defeat Davis. Davis attacked Riordian with negative ads in the primary. The ads questioned Riordan's pro-choice stance by questioning Riordan's support of pro-life politicians and judges. The ads pointed out Riordan's position of wanting a moratorium on the death penalty as being to the left of Gray Davis, who strongly supported it.|$|E

25|$|The National Republican Congressional Committee {{targeted}} Barr's {{race against}} Chandler {{as part of}} their strategy to gain control of the House of Representatives during the 2010 midterm elections, and Ohio Congressman John Boehner– who stood to become Speaker of the House if the Republicans gained a majority– visited the state to campaign on Barr's behalf. Substantial amounts of money from political groups outside the state aided both candidates and spawned a number of negative <b>campaign</b> <b>ads.</b> Chandler started the barrage in August with ads alluding to Barr's arrest in Florida for using a fake ID and seeking to tie him to the wrongdoing of the Fletcher administration. Barr countered with ads criticizing Chandler's support of cap-and-trade legislation– an unpopular vote in coal-dependent Kentucky– and his vote in favor of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which Barr characterized as a waste of taxpayer money that did little to stimulate an economic recovery.|$|E
25|$|Davis {{ran against}} San Francisco mayor Dianne Feinstein for the Democratic {{nomination}} for the United States Senate in the 1992 special election {{to fill the}} Senate seat vacated by Pete Wilson who was elected Governor of California in 1990. The race is often cited {{as an example of}} Davis' history of negative campaign tactics. The Davis campaign featured an ad that compared Feinstein to the incarcerated hotelier Leona Helmsley. Some experts consider that ad to be the most negative in state history. The ad backfired with Davis losing to Feinstein by a significant margin for the nomination although this loss did not stop Davis from using negative <b>campaign</b> <b>ads</b> in the future, including in his race for lieutenant governor. Davis blamed his campaign managers for the defeat and vowed not to let major decisions in future campaigns be decided by his campaign staff. In 2003, when Feinstein urged voters to vote no during the recall election, she was constantly reminded through questions, video and the media about the 1992 primary.|$|E

Further explanations for the Republican defeat ranged from accusations that Tedisco [...] "dither on the stimulus bill", to intimations that Tedisco only became his party's nominee by manipulating the selection process. In an editorial, the Wall Street Journal contended that being an [...] "Albany careerist" [...] and running confusing <b>campaign</b> <b>ads</b> had hurt Tedisco. Tedisco's loss immediately made him appear vulnerable to Democrats hoping to capture his seat in the Assembly.|$|E

[...] Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio raised the subject during televised debates in February and March. One debate moderator, Megyn Kelly of Fox News, pursued the issue at length. Trump responded that Trump University was [...] "a small business" [...] and student evaluations were overwhelmingly positive.
