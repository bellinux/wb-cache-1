40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with the thermal processes during the heating up and <b>cooling</b> down <b>of</b> a <b>furnace,</b> used in the production of ceramic multilayer actuators. The objective of the investigation was first to describe these thermal processes in a batch furnace and then design a furnace which is operated continuously. Time and location dependent measurements have been done in batch <b>furnaces</b> <b>of</b> 60 and 300 litre. The objects in the furnaces are heated up by radiation from sources in the fiunace walls, and cool down after the sources have been switched off, after which either nothing is done with the furnace (natural cooling) or air is blovwn through the furnace (forced cooling). The heating up <b>of</b> the <b>furnace</b> and its complexly shaped contents, has been modelled with a Finite Element Method (FEM) package, viz. Ansys. Hereby it is possible to calculate the temperature distribution in a 3 dimensional geometry as a function of time and place. These simulations have been compared with measurements. The measurements and the simulations agree reasonably well. More simple models are used to describe natural and forced <b>cooling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>furnace</b> and it...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is the {{analysis}} of potential use of new materials in the electric furnace hearth lining and indication of the operating effects for the furnace resulting from their use. The impact of the application of new hearth lining materials on a total power needed to receive through air <b>cooling</b> system <b>of</b> the <b>furnace</b> hearth was also analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: Within the frameworks <b>of</b> research, electric <b>furnace</b> operational properties were compiled and a furnace mathematical model {{on the basis of the}} finite element method was created. Based on operational data the created model was calibrated. Analysis of the influence of new hearth lining materials on the furnace operation was performed. In analysis the change of materials properties resulting from the furnace operation over the years was taken into consideration. Findings: As a result of carried out calculations and analysis the amounts of heat flux transferred, in successive periods of operation, through hearth working layer to cooling installations were acquired. Basing on simulations and calculations, for the above mentioned heat flux, temperatures were calculated on the bottom shell <b>of</b> <b>furnace,</b> in the electrodes axes for different periods <b>of</b> <b>furnace</b> operation. Practical implications: To achieve a decrease in thermal load of hearth it is advisable to reduce thickness of filling material near the vertical wall <b>of</b> <b>furnace</b> and filling the acquired space with new graphite blocks applied to the last layer of hearth.

40|$|Li-rich metal oxides, {{regarded}} as a high-voltage composite cathode, is currently {{one of the hottest}} positive electrode material for lithium-ion batteries, due to its high-capacity and high-energy performance. The crystallography, phase composition and morphology can be altered by synthesis parameters, which can influence drastically the capacity and cycling performance. In this work, we demonstrate Li 1. 207 Ni 0. 127 Mn 0. 54 Co 0. 127 O 2, obtained by a co-precipitation method, exhibits super-high specific capacity up to 298 mAh g− 1 and excellent capacity retention of ∼ 100 % up to 50 cycles. Using neutron powder diffraction and transmission X-ray microscopy, we have found that the cooling-treatments applied after sintering during synthesis are crucially important in controlling the phase composition and morphology of the cathodes, thereby influencing the electrochemical performance. Unique spherical microstructure, larger lattice, and higher content of Li-rich monoclinic component can be achieved in the rapid quenching process, whereas severe particle cracking along with the smaller lattice and lower monoclinic component content is obtained when natural <b>cooling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>furnace</b> is applied. Combined with electrochemical impedance spectra, a plausible mechanism is described for the poorer specific capacity and cycling stability of the composite cathodes...|$|R
30|$|We {{consider}} the experimental condition of Tsuchiyama et al. (2004). In their experiment, the <b>cooling</b> rate <b>of</b> the droplet was Rcool = 1000 K hr− 1 {{if we assume}} that it {{is the same as the}} <b>cooling</b> rate <b>of</b> the <b>furnace.</b> The temperature difference between the center and surface of the droplet can be estimated as δTc − s, 0 ≈ 0.02 K for a sample radius of rd = 500 μ m and with typical thermodynamic properties of silicates (c = 3 × 107 erg K− 1 cm− 3 and κl = 2 × 105 erg cm− 1 s− 1 K− 1, Murase and McBirney, 1973). From the condition of Eq. (11), the molten sample in their experiment must have crystallized at very low supercooling as ΔTs, 0 < 0.1 K to form the rim. The nucleation at such very small supercooling might be due to the contact of the droplet to the carbon capsule. However, the exact value of the nucleation supercooling was not measured, so we cannot test our new constraint with their experiment. In-situ temperature measurement during droplet solidification is required to clarify the condition of rim formation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} <b>of</b> manufacturing <b>furnace</b> optimized re-design. The bottleneck in the production process is the <b>cooling</b> <b>of</b> heat treatment <b>furnaces.</b> These ovens are on an approximate 24 -hour cycle, heating for 12 hours and cooling for 12 hours. Pressurized argon and process water are used to expedite cooling. The proposed modifications aim to minimize cycling by reducing cooling time; they are grouped into three fundamental mechanisms. The first is a recommendation to modify current operating procedures. This entails opening the furnace doors at higher than normal temperatures. A furnace temperature model based on current parameters is used to show the reduction in cooling time in response to opening the furnace doors at higher temperatures. The second mechanism considers the introduction of forced argon convection. Argon {{is used in the}} process to mitigate part oxidation. Cycling argon through the furnace during cooling increases convection over the parts and removes heat from the furnace envelope. Heat transfer models based on convective Nusselt correlations are used to determine the increase in heat transfer rate. The last mechanism considers a modification to the current heat exchanger. By decreasing the temperature of the water jacket and increasing heat exchanger efficiency, heat transfer from the furnace is increased and cooling time is shortened. This analysis is done using the Effectiveness-NTU method...|$|R

Rapid cooling in quenched specimen had successfully increase the hardness by 41 % and recorded the highest tensile strength of 359 MPa while slow cooling rate which experienced by an annealed specimen resulted in the lowest tensile strength of 136 MPa. Microstructure investigation shows annealed specimen produced coarse austenitic structure with larger grain size. Meanwhile, quenched specimen produced finer austenitic structure with smaller grain size.

50|$|After his PhD Esmaeilzadeh {{worked on}} a project that set out to study {{crystals}} based on silicon nitride. In the experiment, silicon nitride was smelted with additives at high temperatures and was then allowed to cool slowly so that crystals formed in the 1,500 to 2,000 degrees Celsius range. One night something unexpected happened when the <b>cooling</b> system <b>of</b> the <b>furnace</b> malfunctioned, shutting the furnace down and leading the melt to rapidly solidify. This resulted in a small yellowish transparent piece of glass instead of crystals. He gradually discovered that he had created a completely new material. He had managed {{to find a way}} to produce nitride-based glass materials with high nitrogen content. It became apparent that the material had high chemical flexibility and that it easily combined with other substances such as metals, while being much harder and having higher thermal resistance. It also became apparent that it had interesting magnetic properties as well as a refractive index nearly as high as that of diamonds. Saeid Esmaeilzadeh applied for a patent for the new glass material and brought on childhood friend and business partner Ashkan Pouya to develop what would ultimately become the materials firm Diamorph AB.|$|R
40|$|Pulverized fuel {{furnaces}} fired with biomass or co-fired with {{coal and}} biomass commonly operate at temperatures above 1600 K. Such temperatures affect the partitioning of inorganic components through phase transformations. In most biomass fuels, potassium {{is a significant}} component present as inorganic species or bound to organic molecules. At temperatures approaching 1600 K KOH and KCl become volatilized and are released to the gas phase. These gases condense out in <b>cooler</b> parts <b>of</b> the <b>furnace</b> and lead to increased corrosive deposits and adhesion of ash. Gas-phase potassium {{can also lead to}} the formation of sulfate aerosols and re-combine with other solid-phase ash components influencing fouling and slagging in the furnace. In order to model these processes and predict the likely fate of potassium during the combustion process, it is necessary to understand the release mechanisms and patterns of release. The patterns of potassium release from particles of biomass burning in a gas flame can be observed using a flame emission spectroscopy technique. This is implemented using a solid-state photo-detector and optical band-pass filter to measure the intensity of the spectral emission of potassium at 766 nm wavelength. The experimental results are used to inform a model of single particle combustion which incorporates a model of gas-phase potassium release. The modelled potassium release mechanisms can be used to predict the partitioning between gas-phase and solid phase ash in different parts <b>of</b> the <b>furnace...</b>|$|R
