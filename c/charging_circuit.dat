50|$|A typical CDI module {{consists}} of a small transformer, a <b>charging</b> <b>circuit,</b> a triggering circuit and a main capacitor. First, the system voltage is raised up to 250 to 600 volts by a power supply inside the CDI module. Then, the electric current flows to the <b>charging</b> <b>circuit</b> and charges the capacitor. The rectifier inside the <b>charging</b> <b>circuit</b> prevents capacitor discharge before the moment of ignition. When the triggering circuit receives the triggering signal, the triggering circuit stops {{the operation of the}} <b>charging</b> <b>circuit,</b> allowing the capacitor to discharge its output rapidly to the low inductance ignition coil. In a CD ignition, the ignition coil acts as a pulse transformer rather than an energy storage medium as it does in an inductive system. The voltage output to the spark plugs is highly dependent on the design of the CD ignition. Voltages exceeding the insulation capabilities of existing ignition components can lead to early failure of those components. Most CD ignitions are made to give very high output voltages, but this is not always beneficial.

50|$|During charging, an {{external}} electrical power source (the <b>charging</b> <b>circuit)</b> applies an over-voltage (a higher voltage than the battery produces, {{of the same}} polarity), forcing a charging current to flow within the battery from the positive to the negative electrode, i.e. in the reverse direction of a discharge current under normal conditions.
