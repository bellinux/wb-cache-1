Deficient drainage is the most important natural characteristic of these soils which therefore are mainly in use for flood-irrigated rice (Oriza sativa). Degradation in these soils is progressively getting stronger since the intensity of agricultural activities leads to a higher soil density, and a lower water infiltration rate. There is a growing interest by farmers to grow other crops such as soybean in <b>rotation</b> <b>with</b> rice but this degradation has become an obstacle to do so. Soil analyses have showed differences in physical, chemical and biological properties as a result of management practices adopted by farmers.

Parameters were considered by farmers: soil type, (expected changes in) quality of soil structure, choice of machinery, farm size, management level, labor, inputs in terms of fertilizer and pesticides, opportunities <b>for</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>with</b> crops other than rice.

40|$|The {{assembly}} of galaxies {{can be described}} by the distribution of their star formation {{as a function of}} cosmic time. Thanks to the WFC 3 grism on HST it is now possible to measure this beyond the local Universe. Here we present the spatial distribution of Halpha emission for a sample of 54 strongly star-forming galaxies at z~ 1 in the 3 D-HST Treasury survey. By stacking the Halpha emission we find that star formation occurred in approximately exponential distributions at z~ 1, with median Sersic index of n= 1. 0 +- 0. 2. The stacks are elongated with median axis ratios of b/a= 0. 58 +- 0. 09 in Halpha, consistent with (possibly thick) disks at random orientation angles. Keck spectra obtained for a subset of eight of the galaxies show clear evidence <b>for</b> <b>rotation,</b> <b>with</b> inclination-corrected velocities of 90 to 330 km/s. The most straightforward interpretation of our results is that star formation in strongly star-forming galaxies at z~ 1 generally occurred in disks.
