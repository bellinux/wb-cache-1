25|$|On May 11, 1994, two scientists, Compton Tucker and David Skole, {{presented}} {{the results of}} a NASA survey at the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs of the United States Congress, a formal scientific assessment of deforestation in Brazil aimed at putting to rest the debate on the rate of forest removal and questions on the effectiveness at Brazilian environmental policies. Whilst undertaking a monitoring and <b>complete</b> <b>assessment</b> was very difficult due {{to the size of the}} rainforest, they concluded that satellite observations had shown a reduction in the rate of forest removal between 1992 and 1993 and that World Bank estimates of 600,000 square kilometers (12%) cleared by that year appeared to be exaggerated. The NASA assessment concurred with the findings of the Brazilian National Space Research Institute (INPE) with an accurate estimation of 280,000 square kilometers (5%) for the same period.|$|E

2500|$|Many rapes do {{not result}} in serious injury. The first medical {{response}} to sexual assault is a <b>complete</b> <b>assessment.</b> This general assessment will prioritize the treatment of injuries by the emergency room staff. Medical personnel involved are trained to assess and treat those assaulted or follow protocols established to ensure privacy and best treatment practices. Informed consent is always required prior to treatment unless {{the person who was}} assaulted is unconscious, intoxicated or does not have the mental capacity to give consent. Priorities governing the physical exam are the treatment of serious life-threatening emergencies and then a general and <b>complete</b> <b>assessment.</b> Some physical injuries are readily apparent such as, bites, broken teeth, swelling, bruising, lacerations and scratches. In more violent cases, the victim may need to have gunshot wounds or stab wounds treated. [...] The loss of consciousness is relevant to the medical history. [...] If abrasions are found, immunization against tetanus is offered if 5 years have elapsed since the last immunization.|$|E
2500|$|Canada {{reviewed}} {{their commitment}} to the project in December 2012, due to the cost overruns. The decision was made following a report by auditing firm KPMG that showed that Canada’s purchase would cost C$45bn over 42 years. Rona Ambrose, Canada’s public works minister said: “We have hit the reset button and are taking the time to do a <b>complete</b> <b>assessment</b> of all available aircraft.” [...] Defence Minister Peter MacKay announced Canada’s plan to buy the F-35 in 2010 saying that the purchase price was $9 billion, but did not provide operating cost estimates. During an election campaign in 2011, the Conservatives declared that the total cost over 20 years would be $16 billion.|$|E

30|$|This {{finding may}} be {{explained}} by the context in which this research was conducted. Due {{to the nature of the}} Chinese examination-centered educational system, students in China tend to put an emphasis on scores and rankings (Guo 2012; Kirkpatrick & Zang 2011). It is possible that diversity in classroom assessment, such as the extent to which all students have an equal chance at <b>completing</b> <b>assessment</b> tasks, may have potentially intensified their performance-oriented assessment environment. When students are given an equal chance at <b>completing</b> <b>assessment</b> tasks, they might tend to be more competitive, which would contribute to the performance-oriented assessment environment. Future research is needed to arrive at a better interpretation on how and why diversity is associated with performance-oriented classroom assessment environment in the Chinese educational context.|$|R

2500|$|John Teti of The A.V. Club's Gameological Society {{considers}} the Wii U a compelling video game system which lacks focus, citing Nintendo Land as [...] "ideas act {{in service of}} the technology". Ben Gilbert of Engadget states that Nintendo delivers on its promise of releasing [...] "a modern HD gaming console" [...] but notes that [...] "there are also some major missteps and half-baked ideas: a befuddling Friends List/Miiverse connection, a complete lack of many system-wide console standards (group chat, achievements, the ability to play non-game disc-based media) and a game controller that lasts only 3.5 hours", and stated {{that he could not}} give a <b>complete</b> <b>assessment</b> of the console with online components such as Nintendo TVii missing at launch. Similarly, TechRadar praised the system's GamePad functionality and HD graphics, but criticized the limited battery power on the GamePad, and the insufficient number of top-tier launch titles. Some industry figures do not consider the Wii U as an eighth-generation console, with many citing the hardware's processing speed. However, Fils-Aimé has noted that similar comments were made in 2006 when the Wii first launched.|$|E
2500|$|During the Mission Status Briefing, International Space Station Program Manager Mike Suffredini {{noted that}} the water {{recycling}} system appeared to be functioning normally after the modifications performed by the crew on orbit. Additional water samples were taken, and the crew would be bringing home approximately six liters of sample water for extensive testing. The crew on the station would not be drinking any of the water until the engineers and scientists on the ground {{had a chance to}} thoroughly analyze the samples taken. Suffredini also noted that while the goal of the EVA activities to perform maintenance on the starboard SARJ was to allow it to operate [...] "periodically", the initial test showed encouraging results, and the lubrication and other work done by the spacewalkers may allow for more routine operations than originally expected. It would be weeks before a more <b>complete</b> <b>assessment</b> could be given, the joint would need to be put through more testing, as well as analysis of the results from engineers on the ground, but Suffredini was encouraged by the initial results.|$|E

Aim: Supervisor interpersonal skill was investigated as a characteristic involved with both supervisee assessment of supervisory alliance and learning outcomes of supervision. Method: Forty supervisors <b>completed</b> <b>assessments</b> for interpersonal skill and provided 8 sessions of supervision to 50 supervisees. Supervisees <b>completed</b> <b>assessments</b> for supervisory alliance and supervision evaluation.

30|$|As noted earlier, the <b>completed</b> <b>assessment</b> {{of debris}} flow {{risk for the}} Stanislaus Complex fire {{required}} an additional eight weeks.

Consequently, the post-fire debris flow risk assessment for the Stanislaus Complex, while adequate for its time, was more an identification of relative debris flow susceptibility reflecting spatial hazard differences rather than an actual assessment of risk.|$|R
