With respect to international service, in 2006 Aeromexico had plans to provide flights to and from Guadalajara, Mexico, but the airport's {{plan to build a}} <b>customs</b> <b>station</b> at the airport was initially rejected by the customs service. However, the possibility of building this station is currently a continuing matter of negotiation between the airport and the customs service, and Aeromexico has indicated a continuing interest in eventually providing service.

500|$|After {{landing at}} Toronto International Airport on May 3, 1969, Hendrix and Terry {{were the last}} to exit the plane. Ruffino was {{carrying}} Hendrix's bags, and he placed them on a counter at the <b>customs</b> <b>station.</b> An agent immediately chastised him, shouting: [...] "If that's not yours, keep your hands off it", to which Ruffino replied: [...] "I work for him." [...] The agent repeated the order before asking Hendrix if they were his bags; he confirmed that they were. At 9:30a.m., authorities detained Hendrix after finding {{a small amount of}} what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. A mobile lab was set up to determine what had been found, and at 1:30p.m. Metro police detective Harry Midgley arrested him for illegal possession of narcotics. After being booked and photographed, he was released on $10,000 bail and required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing.

Users could listen to 20 pre-programmed stations or create their own <b>custom</b> <b>stations</b> by selecting artists and ranking them {{on a scale of}} zero to five. Due to legal restrictions, users could not play specific songs, but their <b>custom</b> <b>stations</b> played songs by higher-rated artists more frequently.

2500|$|The roadway {{continues}} as the East Service Road, unsigned NY971B, for another [...] This was the former route of US9 {{to the border}} prior {{to the construction of}} the Northway.

2500|$|The {{municipality}} {{is located}} in the Centovalli, a valley which was carved by the Melezza river and which has allegedly 100 adjoining valleys (cento valli).

2500|$|In the 19th century, the {{municipality}} suffered several outbreaks of livestock diseases. [...] To protect the dairy industry, non-local herds were forbidden from passing through {{the municipality}}. [...] Cheese was no longer allowed to be carried across the mountains but was now transported on local draft horses. [...] Due to customs taxes with the neighboring Canton of Fribourg, cheese was carried on a route over the Col de Chaude to Villeneuve (VD) {{and from there to}} the shores of Lake Geneva, without crossing the Fribourg border. [...] The abolition of the inter-canton customs and taxes in 1848 led to the demolition of the Fribourg <b>customs</b> <b>station</b> on the main road that had linked Château-d'Œx with the grain and livestock markets. [...] Changes in markets and improvements in animal husbandry led to more Simmental cattle being raised for meat rather than cheese production. [...] The construction of the road over the Col des Mosses (1865–71) and {{the construction of a new}} road to Bulle (1895) eased transportation.|$|E
2500|$|Collins {{joined the}} Provisional IRA during the blanket protest by Long Kesh inmates {{in the late}} 1970s, which sought Special Category Status for republican prisoners, and he became {{involved}} in street demonstrations at this time. He joined the [...] "South Down Brigade" [...] of the IRA, based around Newry. This {{was not one of}} the organisation's most active formations, but it sometimes worked alongside the [...] "South Armagh Brigade", which was one of its most aggressive units. Psychologically unsuited to physical violence, Collins was appointed instead by the IRA as its South Down Brigade's intelligence officer. This role involved gathering information on members of the Crown security forces personnel and installations for targeting in gun and bomb attacks. His planning was directly responsible for at least five murders, including that of the Ulster Defence Regiment Maj. Ivan Toombs in January 1981, with whom Collins worked in the <b>Customs</b> <b>Station</b> at Warrenpoint, and possibly three times that number. Many of the bombing targets of his unit were of limited significance, such as the destruction of Newry public library, and a public house where a Royal Ulster Constabulary choir drank after practice.|$|E

[...] "The Englishmen were three {{faithful}} servants who threw dust not only in your eyes, my dear M. Ratichon, but in those of the customs officials, while the packs contained harmless personal luggage which was taken by your friend and his gendarmes to the <b>customs</b> <b>station</b> at Mijoux, and there, after much swearing, equally solemnly released with many apologies to M. Fournier, who was allowed to proceed unmolested on his way, and who arrived here safely this afternoon, whilst Maman divested herself of her fat and once more became the slender Mme. Aristide Fournier, at your service." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{listen to}} my plan," [...] he said. [...] "We'll journey {{together}} as far as St. Claude; from there you will push on to Gex, and take up your abode in the city, styling yourself an interpreter. This {{will give you the}} opportunity of mixing with some of the smuggling fraternity, and it will be your duty to keep both your eyes and ears open. I, on the other hand, will take up my quarters at Mijoux, the French <b>customs</b> <b>station,</b> which is on the frontier, about half a dozen kilometres from Gex. Every day I'll arrange to meet you, either at the latter place or somewhere half-way, and hear what news you may have to tell me. And mind, Ratichon," [...] he added sternly, [...] "it means running straight, or the reward will slip through our fingers." ...|$|E
