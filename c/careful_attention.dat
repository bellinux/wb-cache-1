5|$|Islamic society paid <b>careful</b> <b>attention</b> to medicine, {{following}} a hadith enjoining {{the preservation of}} good health. Its physicians inherited knowledge and traditional medical beliefs from the civilisations of classical Greece, Rome, Syria, Persia and India. These included the writings of Hippocrates such as {{the theory of the}} four humours, and the theories of Galen. al-Razi (ca. 854–925/935) identified smallpox and measles, and recognized that fever {{was a part of the}} body's defenses. He wrote a 23-volume compendium of Chinese, Indian, Persian, Syriac and Greek medicine. al-Razi questioned the classical Greek medical theory of how the four humours regulate life processes. He challenged Galen's work on several fronts, including the treatment of bloodletting, arguing that it was effective.|$|E
5|$|Priestley {{published}} {{the first volume}} of his projected history of experimental philosophy, The History and Present State of Discoveries Relating to Vision, Light and Colours (referred to as his Optics), in 1772. He paid <b>careful</b> <b>attention</b> to the history of optics and presented excellent explanations of early optics experiments, but his mathematical deficiencies caused him to dismiss several important contemporary theories. Furthermore, he did not include any of the practical sections that had made his History of Electricity so useful to practising natural philosophers. Unlike his History of Electricity, it was not popular and had only one edition, although it was the only English book on the topic for 150 years. The hastily written text sold poorly; the cost of researching, writing, and publishing the Optics convinced Priestley to abandon his history of experimental philosophy.|$|E

IGN {{also noted that the}} Active Time Event system helps to expand the player's understanding of the characters' personalities as they question many ideas and emotions. Their semi-deformed appearance, which also covers monsters of every size, contain detailed animation and design. They gave praise to the pre-rendered backgrounds, noting the <b>careful</b> <b>attention</b> given to the artwork, movement in animations and character interactivity.

5|$|In France, Sauvignon blanc {{is grown}} in the {{maritime}} climate of Bordeaux (especially in Entre-Deux-Mers, Graves and Pessac-Léognan as a dry wine, and in Sauternes as a sweet wine) {{as well as the}} continental climate of the Loire Valley (as Pouilly Fumé, Sancerre, and Sauvignon de Touraine). The climates of these areas are particularly favorable in slowing the ripening on the vine, allowing the grape more time to develop a balance between its acidity and sugar levels. This balance is important {{in the development of the}} intensity of the wine's aromas. Winemakers in France pay <b>careful</b> <b>attention</b> to the terroir characteristics of the soil and the different elements that it can impart to the wine. The chalk and Kimmeridgean marl of Sancerre and Pouilly produces wines of richness and complexity while areas with more compact chalk soils produces wines with more finesse and perfume. The gravel soil found near the Loire River and its tributaries impart spicy, floral and mineral flavors while in Bordeaux, the wines have a fruitier personality. Vines planted in flint tend to produce the most vigorous and longest lasting wines.|$|E

Chinese have claimed that the avionics of Z-10 is more advanced than that of Russian attack helicopters, and the avionics suite enables Z-10 to be able to conduct missions at a level that is just 10 meters above the ground.|$|R

While many efforts are currently being made to standardize this emerging paradigm, <b>careful</b> <b>attentions</b> need to be paid to security at this early design stage too, rather than waiting until the technology becomes mature, thereby potentially avoiding previous pitfalls made when designing the Internet in the 80 ’s.
