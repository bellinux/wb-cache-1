40|$|In {{order to}} compare the two species’ flight {{performance}} over the exposed and windy Falsterbo Peninsula, where thermal conditions seldomly are very favorable, we used tracking radar to study flight parameters of sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus and <b>common</b> <b>buzzards</b> Buteo buteo during autumn migration. The results showed a clear difference between sparrowhawks and <b>common</b> <b>buzzards</b> in their flight altitudes and speeds, and in the wind conditions they encountered. <b>Common</b> <b>buzzards</b> had higher flight altitudes and were more selective of wind. Flight altitude was negatively related to the wind speed, which was most pronounced for <b>common</b> <b>buzzards.</b> Sparrowhawks had higher mean air- and cross-country speeds than <b>common</b> <b>buzzards.</b> Airspeed was negatively related, whereas ground and cross-country speeds were positively related to the tailwind component for both raptors. The differences between sparrowhawks and buzzards could {{to a large degree}} be explained by a larger dependence on thermal soaring among the common buzzards; a strategy associated with selectivity for favourable thermal and wind conditions during migratory flight. An additional important explanation for the interspecific differences was the habit of the sparrowhawks to combine migratory flight with hunting for prey, which makes it prone to fly at lower altitudes and use flapping flight to a much larger degree than <b>common</b> <b>buzzards</b> which do not forage during their migratory passage of the Falsterbo Peninsula...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were to assess bone composition, bone mineral density and mechanical properties of the long bones of two raptor and one owl species as well as to investigate the histological structure. The right humerus and the right tibiotarsus of 53 raptors [common buzzard (Buteo buteo) n= 20 ♂, n= 20 ♀, white-tailed sea eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) n= 7 ♂, n= 6 ♀] and nine barn owls (Tyto alba) [n= 4 ♂, n= 5 ♀] were examined. In the <b>common</b> <b>buzzards</b> 50 % of the animals were juvenile and 50 % were adult. For all parameters statistical analysis was performed for species specific differences, the influence of age, the gender and differences between the bones. The influence of the nutritional status as well as the correlation between the parameters was evaluated. The median bone mineral density (BMD) of the humeri ranged from 1. 9 g/cm 3 (<b>common</b> <b>buzzards)</b> to 2. 0 g/cm 3 (white-tailed sea eagles) and from 1. 8 g/cm 3 (<b>common</b> <b>buzzards)</b> to 2. 0 g/cm 3 (white-tailed sea eagles) in the tibiotarsi. The BMD of the humeri was significantly lower in <b>common</b> <b>buzzards</b> than in white-tailed sea eagles and barn owls (p= 0. 031, p= 0. 004). In the tibiotarsi the BMD of the <b>common</b> <b>buzzards</b> was lower compared to the BMD in whitetailed sea eagles (p= 0. 002). In barn owls the BMD of the humeri was significantly higher compared to the BMD of the tibiotarsi (p= 0. 015). The median dry matter of the humeri ranged from 87. 6 % (<b>common</b> <b>buzzards)</b> to 89. 5 % (white-tailed sea eagles), the median dry matter of the tibiotarsi ranged from 87 % (<b>common</b> <b>buzzards)</b> to 88. 4 % (white-tailed sea eagles). The dry matter of both bones of the <b>common</b> <b>buzzards</b> was significantly lower than in the bones of the barn owls (humerus p= 0. 004, tibiotarsus p= 0. 005). The humeri of the <b>common</b> <b>buzzards</b> had significantly less dry matter than those of the white-tailed sea eagles (p= 0. 001). The humeri of the white-tailed sea eagles had a significantly higher content of dry matter than the tibiotarsi (p= 0. 001). The percentage of bone ash of both bones was significantly lower in the white-tailed sea eagles than in the <b>common</b> <b>buzzards</b> and the barn owls (each with p< 0. 001). The humeri of the <b>common</b> <b>buzzards</b> contained significantly less bone ash than those of the barn owls (p= 0. 016). In the barn owls humeri had significantly more ash compared to the tibiotarsi (p= 0. 021). The content of crude fat was lower than 2 % of the dry matter in all bones. In humeri significantly lower values of calcium (median 220 g/kg ash) were detected in white-tailed sea eagles than in barn owls (median 246 g/kg ash) (p= 0. 007), in tibiotarsi {{no significant differences between the}} species were observed. None of the species had a significant difference in the calcium content of humerus and tibiotarsus. Both bones of the white-tailed sea eagles had significantly lower levels of phosphorus (humeri 103. 5 g/kg ash, tibiotarsi 101. 7 g/kg ash) compared to the bones of the other two species (each with p< 0. 001). In <b>common</b> <b>buzzards</b> both bones displayed significantly lower phosphorus levels than in barn owls (humerus p= 0. 003, tibiotarsus p= 0. 006). The humeri of <b>common</b> <b>buzzards</b> and barn owls contained significantly more phosphorus than the tibiotarsi (p= 0. 018, p= 0. 028). The calcium-phosphorus ratio was about 2 : 1 in all three species. The magnesium content was found to be significantly lower in the white-tailed sea eagles (humeri 2590 mg/kg ash, tibiotarsi 2510 mg/kg ash) than in the <b>common</b> <b>buzzards</b> and barn owls (each with p< 0. 001). The tibiotarsi of the <b>common</b> <b>buzzards</b> (median 3395 mg/kg ash) contained significantly less magnesium than those of the barn owls (median 3720 mg/kg ash) (p= 0. 002). In the <b>common</b> <b>buzzards</b> the content of magnesium was significantly higher in the humeri compared to the tibiotarsi (p= 0. 029), in the barn owls the tibiotarsi contained significantly more magnesium than the humeri (p= 0. 021). In comparison both bones of the barn owls contained significantly higher levels of copper (humeri 8. 7 mg/kg ash, tibiotarsi 12. 7 mg/kg ash) than the bones of the <b>common</b> <b>buzzards</b> and the white-tailed sea eagles (each with p≤ 0. 001). In the <b>common</b> <b>buzzards</b> the copper content of the humeri was significantly higher than in the tibiotarsi (p= 0. 011). The zinc content was highest in the bones of the white-tailed sea eagles with a median of 278 mg/kg ash (humeri) and 273 mg/kg ash (tibiotarsi) (each with p< 0. 001) and lowest in the barn owls with 185 mg/kg ash (humeri) and 199 mg/kg ash (tibiotarsi) (humerus p= 0. 002, tibiotarsus p< 0. 001). The humeri of <b>common</b> <b>buzzards</b> and barn owls had significantly lower zinc levels compared to the tibiotarsi (p< 0. 001, p= 0. 013). The mechanical properties of the long bones were investigated by testing torsional strength. The maximum torque and the stiffness of both bones were the lowest in the barn owls and highest in the white-tailed sea eagles (each significantly with p< 0. 001). Humeri were significantly stronger than tibiotarsi. The histological evaluation of the long bones of two male, adult <b>common</b> <b>buzzards</b> revealed a similar structure compared to other bird species. Most components of the bone were mineralized. The epiphysis was formed by compact bone filled with trabecular bone. The diaphysis consisted of cortical bone which was formed by four different layers. The humerus was pneumatized and the tibiotarsus marrow-filled. Both bones showed structural adaptations known to be associated with torsional and bending forces. The present study investigated important bone characteristics that are suspected to be species specific...|$|R

25|$|However, it is {{the forest}} species which are the most notable of the park, {{especially}} the woodpeckers and owls. Concerning woodpeckers, the great spotted woodpecker is the most common, but the black woodpecker, the European green woodpecker and the lesser spotted woodpecker are also themselves common. The population of white-backed woodpecker, a species classified as very endangered in Sweden with only 16 individuals {{in the whole country}} in 2004, has diminished in the park. Of 7 pairs observed in 1976, one sole individual was observed in 2003, and then a new couple in 2010. This species especially likes old forests with lots of dead trees and the species is thus a good indicator of the richness of the forest. In contrast, the grey-headed woodpecker is becoming more common. Regarding owls, the most common species are the Eurasian pygmy owl and the Ural owl. The latter is in addition the symbol of the park. Apart from these species, there are the <b>common</b> <b>buzzard,</b> the Eurasian hobby, or even, among others, the European honey buzzard.|$|E

Despite some sources claiming {{that there is little}} evidence of predation by great horned owls, one study from Washington found that 10.9% of the local great horned owl's diet was made up of barn owls. In Africa, the principle predators of barn owls are Verreaux's eagle-owls and cape eagle-owls. In Europe, although less dangerous than the eagle owl, the chief diurnal predators are the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and the <b>common</b> <b>buzzard</b> (Buteo buteo). About a dozen other large diurnal raptors and owls have also been reported as predators of barn owls, ranging from the scarcely larger tawny owl to the golden eagle.

40|$|Capsule The {{occurrence}} of oilseed rape increased main prey abundance and breeding success of <b>Common</b> <b>Buzzards.</b> Aims We tested whether the {{occurrence of}} oilseed rape influences the abundance of Common Voles, i. e. the main prey of <b>Common</b> <b>Buzzards</b> and so also nesting activity and breeding success of <b>Common</b> <b>Buzzards.</b> Methods The study {{was carried out in}} 2005 – 2012 in a 38  km 2 area in western Poland, where oilseed rape plantations (12 – 106  ha) covered 18 % of the agricultural land. The number of active burrow entrances was used as an index of vole abundance in various crops, and Buzzard breeding performance, i. e. {{the occurrence of}} annual nesting attempts in individual long-term nesting sites as well as the presence and number of fledglings, was estimated by observations of their nests. Results The index of vole abundance was highest in oilseed rape, and judging by the proportion of active burrow entrances (33 – 77 %), the plantations of rape typically supported a larger portion of the local vole population than other crops. The acreage of oilseed rape fields around individual nesting sites of Buzzards did not affect the probability of nesting attempts in these sites. However, the probability of successful nesting and the number of fledglings per successful nest increased with the area of oilseed rape around the Buzzard nesting sites. Conclusion The occurrence of oilseed rape may positively affect prey availability and in turn the breeding success of Buzzards. The spread of oilseed rape may therefore also be beneficial for other vole-eating raptors hunting in the agricultural landscapes...|$|R

2500|$|Equally or {{even more}} so than the great horned owl, the Eurasian eagle-owl is a threat to any smaller type of raptor it encounters, whether other owls or diurnal birds of prey. All told, more than 20 species of accipitrid, 15 species of owl and 9 species of falcon have been found amongst their prey. The Eurasian eagle-owl is the primary {{predator}} of other birds of prey throughout Eurasia, not even the prolific raptor-killing northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) equals the sheer number of raptors taken. Up to 6% of the overall food by number and 36% by prey biomass for Eurasian eagle-owls can be comprised by other raptorial birds. The primary raptorial prey taken by Eurasian eagle-owls in Europe are two species: the [...] long-eared owl and the [...] <b>common</b> <b>buzzard.</b> Both are taken in such large numbers that they rank in the top five most regularly hunted bird species in Europe. In Luxembourg, the long-eared owl and <b>common</b> <b>buzzard</b> were the fourth and fifth most regularly hunted prey species. Other high rankings have included the long-eared owl being the fourth most regular prey species in Bavaria and the buzzard being the third most regular prey species in a study from the Czech Republic. While migrating, long-eared owls appear to select areas to move through partially based on whether or not eagle-owls are detected, thus eagle-owls have a very serious influence on the behaviour of this prey. Despite the large numbers taken of both of these, the more scarce eagle-owl {{does not seem to have}} a serious deleterious effect on their overall population, especially compared to anthropogenic factors.|$|E

2500|$|While owls are {{apparently}} often {{be killed by}} Eurasian eagle-owls while active and hunting, diurnal raptors are often ambushed at night at their large, conspicuous nests since they are easily located during hunting forays and the raptors are nearly defenseless in nocturnal conditions. The eagle-owl has been specified as the primary predator of common buzzards, peregrine falcons, common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) and black kites. The <b>common</b> <b>buzzard</b> and common kestrel {{are probably the most}} often selected diurnal raptors because they inhabit the edges most often hunted by the eagle-owls. Studies have shown that [...] peregrine falcon experience lower productivity in areas where they nest closely to eagle-owls, as the eagle-owls pick off both nestlings and adults by night. However, peregrine populations were not hugely effected except in cases where small reintroductions were attempted of falcons or falcon populations were already rare due to other causes. The northern goshawk is itself a serious predator of other raptors.
