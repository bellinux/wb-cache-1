The {{goal is to}} design a lens with two freeform surfaces, denoted f and g, that converts it into a new collimated beam with cross sectional intensity I_p(x,y). Such problems are of great importance in the laser industry [6]. The case where I and I_p are both radially symmetric is well-known [15], and {{can be reduced to}} simple ODEs.

Two antenna candidates are described here that provide adequate gain in the coverage zone and are also lower cost.

The second unit is a planar spiral antenna; it generates directional beams by a summation of the azimuthal modes. A variation of this antenna uses conical spirals to fulfill the same task.

With the help of these two monitoring tools, the working tunes were optimized to get more efficient operation. ...|$|R

Each beam is stable inside of a certain region of its existence. Beyond these two regions, beams loose their stability, and new dynamical behaviors appear. We present several types of instabilities related to each beam configuration and give examples of beam dynamics in the areas adjacent to the two regions.

40|$|The beam {{hardening}} {{effect is}} one of the major artifacts of X-ray computed tomography. It not only complicates medical inspection and material analysis, but also influences the accuracy and repeatability of dimensional measurements. Therefore, many efforts have been devoted to develop beam hardening correction methods since the early 1970 s. In practice, the combination of hardware filters (pre-filtration) and linearization algorithms is frequently used. In general, this combination can largely eliminate the cupping effect, resulting in more homogeneous gray values throughout the same material and improving the surface appearance. However, while correcting for the beam hardening effect, other problems are generated, including noise magnification and contrast reduction. Moreover, experiments reveal that in some <b>cases,</b> <b>beam</b> hardening correction methods induce edge offsets of internal structures that are largely dependent on the amount of surrounding material. This worsens the measurement uncertainty. Therefore, this paper investigates the influence of beam hardening correction on the measurement accuracy and uncertainty for CT metrology applications. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A BeppoSAX {{observation}} of the Broad Line Radio– Galaxy 3 C 390. 3 is reported. For the first time, both the Kα iron line and a strong reflection hump, produced by the illumination of the primary X–ray emission on cold matter, are detected in this source. The 0. 1 – 100 keV continuum is modeled by an absorbed hard power law (Γ ∼ 1. 8) reflected at high energies by material with a fairly large covering factor (Ω/ 2 π ≃ 1). The iron line is centered at ≃ 6. 4 keV (rest frame), is intrinsically narrow eV), and has an equivalent width of ≃ 140 eV. We discuss the results {{in the context of}} current models for AGNs and suggest that the primary X–ray power law continuum is probably produced by a hot inner flow, while the reprocessed radiation comes from an outer cold thin disk, and/or from a thick torus at even larger radii. Further observations with BeppoSAX could distinguish between the latter two <b>cases.</b> <b>Beamed</b> radiatio...|$|R
