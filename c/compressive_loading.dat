Whereas the plastic resins are strong in <b>compressive</b> <b>loading</b> and relatively weak in tensile strength, the glass fibers are very strong in tension but tend not to resist compression. By combining the two materials, GRP becomes a material that resists both compressive and tensile forces well.

25|$|A heated {{cylindrical}} billet workpiece is fed {{between two}} convex-tapered rollers, which are rotating {{in the same}} direction. The rollers are usually 6° askew from parallel with the billet's axis. The rollers are {{on opposite sides of}} the billet, and the surface of their largest cross sections are separated by a distance slightly smaller than the outside diameter (OD) of the original billet. The load imparted by the rollers compresses the material and the 6° skew provides both rotation and translation to the billet. The friction between the rollers and the billet is intentionally high, and is sometimes increased by using knurled rollers. This friction establishes stresses varying radially through the billet, with the highest stresses at the OD and the central axis. The stress exceeds the yield strength of the billet and causes circumferential fissures to propagate at various radii near the OD, and a central longitudinal void to form at the axis. A tapered mandrel is set inside and a short distance from the start of the central void. This mandrel forces the material outward and compresses the material against the back side of the tapered rollers. This <b>compressive</b> <b>loading</b> fuses the circumferential fissures and sets the initial internal diameter and OD values. The formed tube is then cooled and can be cold worked to refine the diameters and to achieve the desired yield strengths.|$|E

Hypotheses: Peak {{anterior cruciate ligament}} strains will 1) increase {{with an increase in}} resistance torque during an exercise that involves concentric contraction of the extensor mechanism, 2) decrease with an increase in resistance torque during an exercise that involves concentric contraction of the flexors, and 3) decrease when an external <b>compressive</b> <b>load</b> is applied to the knee during both exercises relative to the no external <b>compressive</b> <b>load</b> condition. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Strains in the anteromedial bundle were measured in 10 subjects with normal ligaments. Flexor and extensor exercises were performed against controlled resistance torques with and without a <b>compressive</b> <b>load</b> applied to the foot. Results: An increase in resistance produced an increase in peak anterior cruciate ligament strain for the extensor exercise with no <b>compressive</b> <b>load</b> applied. During the flexor exercise without a <b>compressive</b> <b>load,</b> an increase in resistance produced a decrease in peak strains. During the extensor exercise, the peak anterior cruciate ligament strain was not reduced with the application of the external compressive force. Conclusions: Extensor and flexor exercises that incorporate an external <b>compressive</b> <b>load</b> do not shield the anterior cruciate ligament from strain.

This present study investigates the manufacturing of seashells-like bioceramic/biocomposites as a filter bed with optimum porosity and <b>compressive</b> <b>load</b> capacity using uniaxial die compaction method. According to the structure of natural sea shell, calcium carbonate bioceramics/biocomposites were designed and manufactured in three steps. In the first step, optimisation of the process parameters and their effects on the porosity (Pr) and <b>compressive</b> <b>load</b> (Cs) of bio-ceramic 1 have been studied. Statistical analyses of the data indicates that only the weight fraction of the pore former and the compaction load influenced significantly the porosity and the <b>compressive</b> <b>load.</b> The compaction speed has no significant influence on the properties of the artificial bioceramic. Higher weight fraction of pore former and lower compaction load leads to high porosity and low <b>compressive</b> <b>load.</b> In the second step, the effect of the particle size of the pore former on porosity and <b>compressive</b> <b>load</b> of calcium carbonate bioceramic 2 was investigated and optimised. The particle size of the pore former has a significant effect on <b>compressive</b> <b>load.</b> No substantial effect of the particle size of the pore former has been found to vary the porosity of the bioceamic 2.

30|$|The {{amount of}} weight bearing and the force {{transmission}} to the frame have an important influence {{on the results of}} treatment with an Ilizarov external fixator. The frame provides beneficial interfragmentary movements and <b>compressive</b> <b>loads</b> at the fracture site through elastic wires.

The <b>compressive</b> <b>loads</b> in the osteotomy were measured with loading cells in the defect zone. The weight-bearing platform had a substantial effect on the biomechanical behaviour of the frame.

50|$|Concrete {{is strong}} in {{compression}} but weak in tension. That is, concrete can withstand {{considerable amount of}} compressive loads but it cannot take much of tensile stresses. When tensile loads are applied, concrete undergoes fracture easily. The reason behind this phenomenon can be explained as follows. The aggregates in concrete are capable of taking compressive stresses so that concrete withstands <b>compressive</b> <b>loading.</b> But during tensile loading cracks are formed which separates the cement particles which hold the aggregates together. This separation of cement particles causes the entire structure to fail as crack propagates.

Duralumin, the first high-strength, heat treatable aluminum alloy, was employed initially for the framework of rigid airships, by Germany and the Allies during World War I. Duralumin was an aluminum-copper-magnesium alloy; it was originated in Germany and developed in the United States as Alloy 17S-T (2017-T4). It was utilized primarily as sheet and plate.Alloy 7075-T6 (70,000-psi yield strength), an Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy, was introduced in 1943. Since then, most aircraft structures have been specified in alloys of this type. The first aircraft designed in 7075-T6 was the Navy’s P2V patrol bomber. A higher-strength alloy in the same series, 7178-T6 (78,000-psi yield strength), was developed in 1951; it has not generally displaced 7075-T6, which has superior fracture toughness.
