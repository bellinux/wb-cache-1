25|$|The female insect’s main {{reproductive}} {{function is}} to produce eggs, including the egg’s protective coating, and to store the male spermatozoa until egg fertilisation is ready. The female reproductive organs include paired ovaries which empty their eggs (oocytes) via the calyces into lateral oviducts, joining to form the common oviduct. The opening (gonopore) of the common oviduct is concealed in a cavity called the genital chamber and this serves as a <b>copulatory</b> <b>pouch</b> (bursa copulatrix) when mating. The external opening to this is the vulva. Often in insects the vulva is narrow and the genital chamber becomes pouch or tube like and is called the vagina. Related to the vagina is a saclike structure, the spermatheca, where spermatozoa are stored ready for egg fertilisation. A secretory gland nourishes the contained spermatozoa in the vagina.|$|E

40|$|Pheretima darnleiensis is {{a native}} {{earthworm}} of Southeast Asia, India, and Japan. Although it is commonly found in Indonesia, the earthworm has never been studied well. This study was aimed to examine the morphological characters and structure of its several organs for an identification purpose, which {{is important for the}} earthworm culture. Earthworms were collected in a plot of 55 - 150 × 55 - 150 cm width and 20 cm depth at Bogor Agricultural University in Darmaga and Baranangsiang Campuses by hand sorting method. Examinations were carried out on its external as well as internal characters. The histology of the organs was studied using paraffin method. The observed characters on P. darnleiensis were the presence of prostate gland, one pair of male pores on segment XVIII, a cylindrical body with perichaetine setae, caeca on segment XXVII, <b>copulatory</b> <b>pouches</b> without diverticula and stalked glands, bithecal spermatheca with nephridia, and the first spermathecal pore on segment 4 / 5. In addition, other characters found on P. darnleiensis were the presence of an annular clitellum on segment XIV-XVI, an epilobus prostomium with open base, approximately 40 single pointed setae on segment XIII, one midventral female pore on segment XIV, one pair of lateroventral male pores on segment XVIII, four pairs of lateroventral spermathecal pores on segment 4 / 5, 5 / 6, 6 / 7, 7 / 8, and the first middorsal dorsal pore on segment 12 / 13.

40|$|Among the {{specimens}} of Ac. Büttikoferi from Liberia, described in my foregoing paper ¹), I found {{a number of}} smaller Acanthodrilidae, which at first I believed to be young individuals of the same species. However examining them more accurately, I recognized that they present some characters, which hitherto are not observed in any other species of the genus Acanthodrilus, and I have no doubt, that they belong to a new species. In honour of the Naturalist, who had done so much to increase {{our knowledge of the}} tropical Earthworms, I will name it Ac. Beddardi. The length of the largest individual is about 160 m. m. The cephalic lobe is rather long, compared to that of Ac. Büttikoferi and the setae are more projecting than in this species. The setae are arranged in four pairs, upon a whitecolored ridge in the middle of each segment; in the anterior segments they are situated on the ventral side of the hody, however in the posterior segments the dorsal pair of them is placed more laterally. The clitellum is very distinct, extending from segment (13) 14 to (19) 20; it shows at the ventral side a deep, rectangular groove over its total length. The male generative apertures are situated in this depressed area, upon two pairs of papillae, in the 17 th and 19 th ring. The <b>copulatory</b> <b>pouches</b> open between the 7 th and 8 th, the 8 th and 9 th segment, in front of the ventral pairs of setae; {{in the vicinity of the}} openings there is a glandular, not well-defined area upon the ventral side of segment 7, 8 and 9...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe current {{revision}} provisionally lists 77 valid earthworm taxa {{in seven}} families from Japan, with approximately 80 further names (ca. 50 % of the total) either in synonymy – including 40 new synonyms – or retained as species incertae sedis. Generic {{placement of the}} species yielded 17 new combinations. About 30 species are known introductions and another ten are possibly more widespread, thus the probable number of wholly endemic Japanese earthworms is around 40 species (ca. 50 % of the total valid species). However, a definitive work on the systematics of Japan's earthworms is pending, and the current revision aims only to provide a status quo and to track changes from the last comprehensive revision by Easton (1981) that listed 74 taxa. Subsequently, 60 or so new pheretimoid names were added by Ishizuka in 1999 – 2001, {{but only a few}} are considered valid taxa, the remainder being synonyms or species incertae sedis. The substitute name ‘Pheretima’ palarva, nom. nov., is provided for the junior homonym Pheretima parvula Ishizuka et al., 2000. While much of Easton's synopsis is supported, Pontodrilus is now placed in Megascolecidae sensu Blakemore (2000) rather than Acanthodrilidae sensu Gates (1959); Amynthas carnosus (Goto & Hatai, 1899) is removed from synonymy with Amynthas gracilis; and an informal Amynthas corticis species-complex is established to accommodate the various morphs of this widely distributed species group. Pheretima (Parapheretima) koellikeri Michaelsen, 1928 is considered synonymous with Metaphire vesiculata (Goto & Hatai, 1899), thereby removing the genus Pheretima sensu stricto from the Japanese list. Polypheretima is also removed from Japanese indigeny, as the original description of Polypheretima iizukai (Goto & Hatai, 1899) failed to report intestinal caeca, and inspection of fresh material allows its placement in synonymy with Amynthas fuscatus (Goto & Hatai, 1898). Easton (1981) had listed this taxon as Metaphire fuscata, but further demonstration of superficial male pores qualifies it for Amynthas. Conversely, the discovery of <b>copulatory</b> <b>pouches</b> results in transfer from Amynthas to Metaphire for M. hilgendorfi (Michaelsen, 1892), comb. nov., Metaphire communissima (Goto & Hatai, 1898), comb. nov., and Metaphire megascolidioides (Goto & Hatai, 1899), comb. nov. The Metaphire hilgendorfi/Amynthas tokioensis species-complex (Amynthas hilgendorfi species-complex sensu Easton 1981) {{remains one of the most}} intractable and pressing problems for comprehension of the Japanese fauna, as most of the component taxa, e. g. Metaphire agrestis (Goto & Hatai, 1899), are parthenogenetically degraded morphs as yet unaffiliated with their ancestral and biparental populations. Resolution may be sought employing combinations of morphological and molecular (RNA, DNA) techniques to determine specific affinities while also complying with requirements of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN 1999) ...|$|R
