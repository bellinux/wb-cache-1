The highway intersects I-75 north of Cartersville, and continues to head east, passing Lake Allatoona to its north, and entering <b>Cherokee</b> <b>County.</b> SR20 heads east into central <b>Cherokee</b> <b>County</b> and through its county seat in Canton, and has a brief concurrency with I-575/SR5, before continuing east into Forsyth County.

He also argued that Price's support for transportation and energy bills would increase the federal deficit. Price defended these bills, arguing that the former would return more tax-payer money to Georgia and that the latter could potentially help the United States achieve energy independence. Price raised $1.5 million throughout the primary campaign, while Konop merely raised around $50,000. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution endorsed Price in the primary election, suggesting that Price could {{play an important role in}} shaping future health care legislation.

25|$|The Georgia Department of Transportation {{average annual}} daily traffic (AADT) {{numbers for the}} year 2011 show some variety in the average daily traffic load numbers as the route travels north. The traffic load averages start at their high point on the route, {{with an average of}} 16,530 {{vehicles}} using the short stretch between SR140 and the start of the Birmingham Highway portion. Those numbers then steadily decrease as SR372 heads north, going from 9,390 initially down to just over 3,000 as <b>Cherokee</b> <b>County</b> approaches. The average load stays between 3,000 and 3,500 south of SR20, climbs to 5,500 north of SR20, and goes up once more to around 6,200 north of SR369. The area south of, and into, Ball Ground sees an average vehicle load of between 7,000 and 7,500, cresting once more at 8,680 heading north out of downtown towards I-575/SR5/SR515. However, the short stretch that feeds directly into the aforementioned state route only carries 3,900 vehicles per day, illustrating that the feeder route into SR5 south of Ball Ground sees heavier traffic than this northern spur.|$|E
25|$|The Georgia Department of Transportation {{average annual}} daily traffic (AADT) {{numbers for the}} year 2011 show a variety of daily averages across SR20. The traffic load on the highway starts at its lowest daily average load as the route starts into Floyd County, where numbers hover around 5,400 {{vehicles}} per day. These averages increase rapidly as the highway approaches Rome, going from around 12,000 vehicles to a peak of 38,000 vehicles in downtown Rome. As SR20 becomes concurrent with US27/SR1, the numbers decrease {{to an average of}} 32,000, and then decrease more rapidly to around 15,000 as SR20 heads east out of Rome. The vehicle load stays in that area all the way through Floyd County and into Bartow County, as the highway is the main west-to-east thoroughfare between Rome and Cartersville. In Cartersville, where the highway is concurrent with US41, the vehicle count reaches a zenith of just over 41,000, but then drops off sharply as the highway heads into rural <b>Cherokee</b> <b>County,</b> dipping just below 10,000 before increasing again to near 24,000 vehicles per day as it approaches I-575/SR5. On the portion of the highway that is concurrent with I-575/SR5, the highway sees its maximum vehicle load of just over 54,000 vehicles, again dropping rapidly east of I-575/SR5, going from around 24,000 down to 11,000, and further down to around 10,000 as the Forsyth County line is reached.|$|E
