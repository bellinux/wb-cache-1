40|$|Microwave heating {{is faster}} than the {{conventional}} way, therefore {{it is interesting to}} apply for cocoa roasting. This research was aimed at gaining information on the effect of microwave roasting of ground <b>cocoa</b> <b>nib</b> on the antioxidative properties of crude polyphenol extract from the product. The results indicated that microwave roasting of ground <b>cocoa</b> <b>nib</b> for 5 min, adjusted at 20 % of the full power (900 W) gave no significant difference in inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation and scavenging of DPPH radical activity of the crude polyphenol extract compared to that of the conventional roasting at 140 oC for 40 min. But having reduction of ferric ion activity more greater and chelating ferro ion activity more lower. The crude polyphenol extract inhibited linoleic acid oxidation and scavenged DPPH free radical. The inhibition was lower than that of either BHT or a-tocoferol at concentration lower than 400 ug/ml for linoleic acid oxidation and that lower than 40 ug/ml for DPPH free radical scavenging.

40|$|Roasting {{of cocoa}} beans is a {{critical}} stage for development of its desirable flavour, aroma and colour. Prior to roasting, cocoa bean may taste astringent, bitter, acidy, musty, unclean, nutty or even chocolate-like, depends on the bean sources and their preparations. After roasting, the bean possesses a typical intense cocoa flavour. The Maillard or non-enzymatic browning reactions {{is a very important}} process for the development of cocoa flavor, which occurs primarily during the roasting process and it has generally been agreed that the main flavor components, pyrazines formation is associated within this reaction involving amino acids and reducing sugars. The effect of <b>cocoa</b> <b>nib</b> roasting conditions on sensory properties and colour of cocoa beans were investigated in this study. Roasting conditions in terms of temperature ranged from 110 to 160 OC and time ranged from 15 to 40 min were optimized by using Response Surface Methodology based on the cocoa sensory characteristics including chocolate aroma, acidity, astringency, burnt taste and overall acceptability. The analyses used 9 - point hedonic scale with twelve trained panelist. The changes in colour due to the roasting condition were also monitored using chromameter. Result of this study showed that sensory quality of cocoa liquor increased with the increase in roasting time and temperature up to 160 OC and up to 40 min, respectively. Based on the Response Surface Methodology, the optimised operating condition for the roaster was at temperature of 127 OC and time of 25 min.

In this work {{the influence of the}} process parameters involved with the pressing stage on the final cocoa butter yield is investigated. All GAME experiments were performed with 10 MPa of CO 2. It is shown that neither the mass of <b>cocoa</b> <b>nibs</b> used, the duration of the pressing stage nor the mechanical pressure profile has a significant influence on the final cocoa butter yield. The moisture content of the nibs determines the behaviour of the solid structure during the pressing stage, thereby determining the cocoa butter yield that can be achieved as well as the speed with which it can be obtained. The maximum yield is obtained at a moisture content of 1. 3 wt. % (wet basis). Lower moisture contents result in a faster compression of the cake. It is impossible to recover cocoa butter with GAME at 100 °C when nibs with moisture contents higher than 5. 5 wt. % are used due to the extrusion of the cocoa solids through the filter medium. Similar yields were obtained when cocoa liquor and <b>cocoa</b> <b>nibs</b> were used in GAME experiments at the same conditions. Lastly it is shown that higher yields can be achieved when multi-stage GAME is used instead of single stage GAME. An absolute increase in cocoa butter yield of 7 – 10 % was achieved when two-stage GAME was used instead of single stage GAME. - Industrial relevance - Cocoa butter is used as an ingredient in a number of popular foodstuffs, and continuous efforts are made by industry to improve the current cocoa butter recovery processes.

Gas assisted mechanical expression (GAME) utilises the much higher solubility of supercritical CO 2 in the oil to enhance the extraction yields of mechanical expression. GAME experiments with <b>cocoa</b> <b>nibs</b> were performed at 40 – 100 °C, CO 2 pressures of 0 – 20 MPa and effective mechanical pressures of 20 – 50 MPa. The maximum yield with conventional expression (71. 8 %) was obtained at a mechanical pressure of 50 MPa and a temperature of 100 °C.

The cocoa butter yield increases with increasing CO 2 pressure until 10 MPa but remains almost constant for higher CO 2 pressures. In contrast to conventional expression GAME also allows the recovery of cocoa butter from <b>cocoa</b> <b>nibs</b> at temperatures below the melting point of pure cocoa butter.
