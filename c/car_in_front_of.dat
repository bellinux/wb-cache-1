5|$|For the {{interior}} scenes used {{to depict the}} first moments of the Impala being hit, the actors were required {{to sit in the}} <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> a blue screen; this allowed for the truck's headlights to later be added in with visual effects. The car itself was attached to a separate rig that was built to replicate the impact of the crash. As the scene was shot, the rig flipped the car onto its side. The passenger-side window was then shattered, though the actors were protected by a sheet of Lexan that had been placed very close to the window; at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window had exploded onto them.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 26 October 1978, {{about a week after}} the {{extermination}} threat, George Burkitt and his 20-year-old son Philip were working on Philip's Triumph Spitfire <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> their house. At around 7pm, annoyed by the noise they were making, Williams shot them both with a 9mm, Smith & Wesson automatic pistol. George died where he fell and Philip, wounded, ran into the house. Williams followed him, shooting him again and killing him. He then shot and killed George's wife, Iris. The Burkitts' 17-year-old daughter was hit four times in the back and once in the thigh, but survived. Two other neighbours, a married couple who had witnessed the attack on the Burkitts, also survived being shot. The injured were treated at Birmingham General Hospital.|$|E

5|$|The car {{scene with}} Gillian Anderson and Annabeth Gish {{was shot at}} Kanan Road, Malibu. Anderson and Gish sat in {{what is known as}} an insert car, while the crew sat in a pickup <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> them. The birth scene was filmed at the old Paramount Movie Ranch. According to {{director}} Kim Manners, the most difficult scene to shoot was in the elevator with Mitch Pileggi and Nicholas Lea. Gish had never worked much with guns before joining The X-Files cast, so the producers got a retired LAPD officer to teach her more about firearms. She did some shooting practices before returning to the set. The FBI garage scenes were shot in Century City and took a total of four days to finish.|$|E
5|$|The final level {{takes place}} in Washington, D.C. again, where the two antagonists attempt to flee after {{escaping}} from prison. The player must destroy both Kilbaba and Ortega and stop four trucks carrying nuclear bombs from blowing up the White House.

Once all levels are complete, the ending sequence begins and depicts the protagonist and his co-pilot in an open-topped <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> cheering crowds.|$|E
5|$|Around an {{hour after}} the start of the race, three {{children}} were struck by car driven by one of the race officials on a side road from Quarter Bridge Road, near the finish line. None sustained serious injuries; two of them had cuts dressed, while the third rushed back to watching the racing. Another, more serious, accident occurred on the Snaefell Mountain Railway, which had been transporting people up the mountain to watch the racing. A tramcar that had been descending the railway had broken down, and a second car had stopped close behind it. A third tram, on rounding the bend above them, was unable to stop in time and collided into the rearmost car, which was then propelled into the <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> it. Minor injuries were sustained by some of the passengers, though none were serious.|$|E

25|$|The {{first use}} of a safety car in Formula One is {{reported}} to have taken place at the 1973 Canadian Grand Prix, where a yellow Porsche 914 was called for duty following various incidents under treacherous weather conditions. Controversially, on that occasion, it took several hours after the race to figure out the winner and final results since the safety car driver had placed his <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the wrong competitor thus causing part of the field to be one lap down incorrectly.|$|E

In 1922–1923, Daskalov was at the helm of major repressions against IMRO's activity in Pirin Macedonia, the northeastern part of the region allotted by the treaty to Bulgaria. On 15 December 1922, he was targeted by an IMRO-organised assassination attempt in Sofia. IMRO member (komitadji) Asen Daskalov threw a bomb at Rayko Daskalov's <b>car</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the National Assembly building in Sofia, though the politician was not injured.|$|E
