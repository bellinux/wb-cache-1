50|$|Venus {{is similar}} to Earth in size and density, and so {{probably}} also in bulk composition, {{but it does not}} have a significant magnetic field. Earth's magnetic field is produced by {{what is known as the}} core dynamo, consisting of an electrically conducting liquid, the nickel-iron outer core that rotates and is convecting. Venus is expected to have an electrically <b>conductive</b> <b>core</b> of similar composition, and although its rotation period is very long (243.7 Earth days), simulations show that this is adequate to produce a dynamo. This implies that Venus lacks convection in its outer core. Convection occurs when there is a large difference in temperature between the inner and outer part of the core, but since Venus has no plate tectonics to let off heat from the mantle, it is possible that outer core convection is being suppressed by a warm mantle. It's also possible that Venus may lack a solid inner core for the same reason, if the core is either too hot or is not under enough pressure to allow molten nickel-iron to freeze there.|$|E

5000|$|Al-Ca {{composite}} is a high-conductivity, high-strength, lightweight composite {{consisting of}} sub-micron-diameter pure calcium metal filaments embedded inside a pure aluminium metal matrix. The material {{is still in}} the development phase, but it has potential use as an overhead high-voltage power transmission conductor. [...] It could also be used wherever an exceptionally light, high-strength conductor is needed. Its physical properties make it especially well-suited for DC transmission. Compared with conventional conductors such as aluminium-conductor steel-reinforced cable (ACSR), all aluminium alloy conductors (AAAC), aluminium conductor alloy reinforced (ACAR), aluminium conductor composite reinforced ACCR and ACCC conductor that conduct AC current well and DC current somewhat less well (due to the skin effect), Al-Ca conductor is essentially a single uniform material with high DC conductivity, allowing the core strands and the outer strands of a conductor cable to all be the same wire type. This conductor is inherently strong so that {{there is no need for}} a strong (usually poorly <b>conductive)</b> <b>core</b> to support its own weight as is done in conventional conductors. This eliminates the [...] "bird caging", spooling, and thermal fatigue problems caused by thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the core and outer strands. The Al-Ca phase interfaces strengthen the composite substantially, but do not have a noticeable effect on restricting the mean free path of electrons, which gives the composite both high strength and high conductivity, a combination that is normally difficult to achieve with both pure metals and alloys. The high strength and light weight could reduce the number of towers needed per kilometer for long distance transmission lines. Since towers and their foundations often account for 50% of a powerline's construction cost, building fewer towers would save a substantial fraction of total construction costs. The high strength also could increase transmission reliability in wind/ice loading situations. The high conductivity has the potential to reduce Ohmic losses.|$|E

40|$|Repeated {{resistivity}} measurement is {{a potentially}} powerful method for monitoring development of internal erosion and anomalous seepage in earth embankment dams. This study {{is part of}} a project to improve current longterm monitoring routines and data interpretation and increasing the understanding when interpreting existing data. This is accomplished by modeling various occurrences typical of embankment structures using properties from two rockfill embankment dams with central till cores in the north of Sweden. The study evaluates the influence from 3 D effects created by specific dam geometry and effects of water level fluctuations in the reservoir. Moreover, a comparison between different layout locations is carried out, and delectability of internal erosion scenarios is estimated through modeling of simulated damage situations. Software was especially developed to model apparent resistivity for geometries and material distributions for embankment dams. The model shows that the 3 D effect from the embankment geometry is clearly significant when measuring along dam crests. For dams constructed with a <b>conductive</b> <b>core</b> of fine-grained soil and high-resistive rockfill, the effect becomes greatly enhanced. Also, water level fluctuations have a clear effect on apparent resistivities. Only small {{differences were found between the}} investigated arrays. A layout along the top of the crest is optimal for monitoring on existing dams, where intrusive investigations are normally avoided, because it is important to pass the current through the <b>conductive</b> <b>core,</b> which is often the main target of investigation.

40|$|The cores of {{high-grade}} {{nickel and}} copper sulphides appear as "perfect conductors" to most electromagnetic (EM) and airborne electromagnetic (AEM) systems, {{because they have}} bulk electrical conductivities {{of the order of}} 100, 000 S/m. The EM response of these highly <b>conductive</b> <b>cores</b> is essentially undetectable with off-time measurements or when using nonrigid towed-bird systems. Compact AEM systems with accurate primary field bucking and on-time or in-phase measurements are sensitive to perfect conductors, but are incapable of detecting deep targets.

A twin (Gemini) aircraft test was undertaken to test this concept in 2005. The field test successfully demonstrated detection of very conductive targets. Errors associated with geometric changes were better than 0. 5 % of the primary field at 400 m separation, allowing detection and characterization of the 30 Hz, in-phase response of small and extended conductors.

30|$|The models we have {{reviewed}} in this paper further show that better knowledge of the adiabatic temperature gradient and the adiabatic heat flux is required. First, {{the relation between the}} slopes of the adiabatic temperature and the melting temperature as a function of pressure determines the crystallization process; i.e., whether the first crystals form at the CMB, in the center, or somewhere in the core. Note, however, that it is not obvious that the core temperature must vary along an adiabat at the time of first crystal formation. For thermal evolution models, we typically attain a subadiabatic core heat flux after a few hundred million years of evolution and prior to crystallization. The core is then likely thermally stable, exhibiting a <b>conductive</b> <b>core</b> temperature profile. Second, there is an inverse correlation between the heat flux along the adiabat and the lifetime of the dynamo. In the contemporary literature, we find differences in the dynamo lifetime for either a thermal or compositional dynamo from 100  Ma to several billion years, depending on the parameters adopted for the thermal conductivity and thermal expansivity and, thus, for the adiabatic heat flux.|$|E
