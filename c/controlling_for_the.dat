5|$|Experiments {{confirming}} {{the role of}} kin selection in worker policing demonstrate the effects of multiple matings, {{which can lead to}} lower average relatedness between workers. Queens of the social wasp Dolichovespula saxonica mate singly or multiply. Researchers who study these wasps have observed a strong positive correlation between worker relatedness and male production. After <b>controlling</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> absolute number of eggs laid, these scientists conclude that the queen's multiple matings favor mutual worker policing.|$|E

The original Yonah, however, tells the Gestalt Nier that she can hear the new Yonah inside her, and that she loves the Replicant Nier and deserves the body just as much. She vacates the body, and Nier and Yonah are reunited.|$|E

5|$|The adult jaguar is an apex predator, {{meaning it}} exists {{at the top}} of its food chain and is not preyed on in the wild. The jaguar has also been termed a {{keystone}} species, as it is assumed, through controlling the population levels of prey such as herbivorous and granivorous mammals, apex felids maintain the structural integrity of forest systems. However, accurately determining what effect species like the jaguar have on ecosystems is difficult, because data must be compared from regions where the species is absent as well as its current habitats, while <b>controlling</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> effects of human activity. It is accepted that mid-sized prey species undergo population increases {{in the absence of the}} keystone predators, and this has been hypothesized to have cascading negative effects. However, field work has shown this may be natural variability and the population increases may not be sustained. Thus, the keystone predator hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists.|$|E

25|$|A 2005 review {{determined}} that some, but not all, randomized controlled {{studies have found}} that AAS use correlates with hypomania and increased aggressiveness, but pointed out that attempts to determine whether AAS use triggers violent behavior have failed, primarily because of high rates of non-participation. A 2008 study on a nationally representative sample of young adult males in the United States found an association between lifetime and past-year self-reported AAS use and involvement in violent acts. Compared with individuals that did not use steroids, young adult males that used AAS reported greater involvement in violent behaviors even after <b>controlling</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> effects of key demographic variables, previous violent behavior, and polydrug use. A 1996 review examining the blind studies available at that time also found that these had demonstrated a link between aggression and steroid use, but pointed out that with estimates of over one million past or current steroid users in the United States at that time, an extremely small percentage of those using steroids appear to have experienced mental disturbance severe enough to result in clinical treatments or medical case reports.|$|E

50|$|From these models, the {{mediation}} effect is calculated as (τ - τ’). This represents {{the change in}} the magnitude of the effect that the independent variable has on the dependent variable after <b>controlling</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mediator. From examination of these equations it can be determined that (αβ) = (τ - τ’). The α term represents the magnitude {{of the relationship between the}} independent variable and the mediatior. The β term represents the magnitude of the relationship between the mediator and dependent variable after <b>controlling</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> effect of the independent variable. Therefore (αβ) represents the product of these two terms. In essence this is the amount of variance in the dependent variable that is accounted for by the independent variable through the mechanism of the mediator. This is the indirect effect, and the (αβ) term has been termed the product of coefficients.|$|E
