40|$|Women {{accounts}} for only some 2 % of <b>civil</b> <b>engineers</b> in Japan and that is significantly small compared to the engineers of other fields, or the target “ 30 % by 2020 ” set by the government. However, supports for women <b>civil</b> <b>engineers</b> in Japan first began in the 1980 s and is now expanding to the private firms. In this study, the statistics of women <b>civil</b> <b>engineers</b> are grasped at first. Then the activities by firms, academic societies and organization of women <b>civil</b> <b>engineers</b> are reviewed to further discuss the possibility and challenges. Conclusion includes the importance of 30 -year dedication by the self-help groups of women <b>civil</b> <b>engineers,</b> and the need of awareness and leadership by the top management for effectively supporting women <b>civil</b> <b>engineers...</b>|$|R
