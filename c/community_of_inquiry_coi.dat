Of the 252 reports, 48 collected and analyzed data on one or more aspects of the CoI framework; only five included a measure of student learning.

Concerns about the soundness of such measures pervade the educational measure m e n t community; in addition, we question the validity of the particular items employed in the CoI literature. Bracketing these concerns, the review indicates that it is unlikely that deep and meaningful learning arises in CoI.

30|$|The {{advent of}} Web 2.0 technologies, {{established}} a more definitive sense of openness {{and it was}} not long before the focus shifted from the technology itself to the collaborative character of the design practices developed through these applications (Achten & Beetz, 2009).The character of the use of the internet shifted from repository to interactive, while blogging gave users the unprecedented opportunity to communicate and exchange content freely. The web began to be considered as an actual source of knowledge that offered “very low-cost communications, information abundance and the development of active and autonomous agents” (Anderson, 2016, p. 40 – 41). It became dominant in theories such as connectivism which claims that “learning can reside outside of ourselves” (Siemens, 2005) and in the extended versions of theories such as the <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice (CoP) and the <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> (<b>CoI)</b> both representative <b>of</b> a model of knowledge that is based on social collaboration. These theories were in fact revisited and revised after Web 2.0 technology invaded the educational domain to describe how the proliferation of open online resources and means of communication and exchange determined a new learning behavior for the web users.

40|$|ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATIONThe Struggle is Real: Student Perceptions of Quality in Online Courses {{using the}} <b>Community</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> (<b>CoI)</b> FrameworkbyBarbara TaylorDoctor of Education in Educational LeadershipUniversity of California, San Diego, 2016 California State University, San Marcos, 2016 Carolyn Huie Hofstetter, ChairCalifornia {{is in an}} {{educational}} drought and is facing a “college deficit” of college graduates. By 2030, it is anticipated that California will have a 1. 1 million shortage of college-educated workers (Diaz, 2015). The struggle is real {{for people who want}} to get into college and for those who are in college trying to complete their higher education degree. As learners progress through the higher education system, various obstacles may happen in their lives to derail and divert their path to degree completion. To fulfill that desire, an increasing number of students are taking online courses and/or participating in online degree programs. The number of students taking online courses has increased for the 13 th consecutive year (Allen & Seamans, 2016). This puts tremendous pressure on higher education faculty and administrators to demonstrate that online courses are equal to or better than face-to-face courses in terms of quality and student success due to the scrutiny about the quality of online courses by faculty, students, administrators, accrediting bodies, and legislatures. One of the ways to examine the quality of instruction is to evaluate levels of social, teaching, and cognitive presence in online courses. Using the <b>Community</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> (<b>CoI)</b> framework, this study looked at the perceptions of quality from the student viewpoint. The literature review revealed there is little research that looks at quality through the lens of a student. This is the first study to investigate all three elements of the <b>Community</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> (<b>CoI)</b> framework operationalized through the California State University (CSU) Quality Online Learning and Teaching (QOLT) instrument. The survey instrument measures undergraduate student perceptions of social, teaching, and cognitive presence in addition to accessibility, technology, and user support elements. The data from the 113 participants matriculating at a mid-sized, four-year university indicate that undergraduate students perceived the courses with all three elements of social, teaching, and cognitive presence to be high quality courses. The data from a single undergraduate instructor illustrates the importance of developing student-focused courses with social, teaching, and cognitive presence. Limitations, implications, and areas for future research are presented...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} how {{the efficacy of}} new online learning technologies can be assessed with indicators <b>of</b> the <b>Community</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> Framework (<b>CoI).</b> The CoI framework has attracted considerable interest and has been used extensively to study and design online educational environments (Garrison & Arbaugh, 2007). The CoI explains the online learning experience {{as a function of}} three overlapping presences – social, cognitive and teaching. The construct was validated through factor analysis by a multi-institutional team of researchers in 2007 (Swan, Richardson, Ice, Garrison, Cleveland-Innes & Arbaugh, 2008), however, many questions remain as to what factors influence the effective projection of each presence. As the model is based on constructivist learning theory, the impact of pedagogically based application of new technologies should impact the level and quality of interactions probed by the CoI indicators. This research examines this hypothesis through two case studies that involve both quantitative and qualitative measures...|$|R
40|$|In 2010 the Open University’s (OU) Department of Languages {{launched}} its first fully online module, English for academic purposes (EAP). To prepare the tutors for teaching {{in an online}} only context a 6 -week training programme - also fully online - was set up. Drawing on the materials developed for the programme we will illustrate {{the potential impact of}} task design on the establishment of social presence (SP) among the participants. We shall also verify how this in turn determines the success of the online learning experience. Our analysis is an exploration of the dynamics among participants {{as a result of their}} task performances with a particular focus on SP. It is based on postings to the tutor training forum, the tutor group fora (groups of learners and their respective tutors) and two post training synchronous debriefing and evaluation sessions. The study suggests that social presence (SP) as defined by Kehrwald (2008), namely the ability of the individual to demonstrate his/her availability for and willingness to participate in interaction, is the central driving force for successful online <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> <b>inquiry</b> (<b>CoI)</b> as understood by Garrison, Anderson and Archer (2000). We conceptualise both the tutors who took part in the training and the student groups with whom they subsequently embarked on the EAP online journey as such CoIs. However, drawing on our data and Morgan’s (2011) critique of Garrison et al. (2000) we will argue for a fundamental re-consideration of the CoI's tripartite approach which separates social presence from cognitive and teaching presence. Instead, we propose Galley’s (2010) “community indicators” as an alternative framework for online education in general and CALL in particular with SP as the guiding principle for material and task design for both (language) teaching and learning and teacher education purposes. This approach seems more apt to promote the democratic, learner-centred, and identity building processes online which the new electronic media facilitate (Warschauer, 1999). ...|$|R

Building on the <b>Community</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> model (<b>CoI)</b> — a foundation commonly used in the research and practice of digital learning and teaching — this research builds on the existing body of knowledge in two important ways. First, given that the CoI model requires substantial manual coding of student discourse, its potential for guiding pedagogical interventions are limited. Thus, the first contribution is the development of a learning analytics system that automates this coding process by means of a novel text-classification algorithm that takes into the account the process nature of inquiry-based learning and the specifics of communication through asynchronous discussions. Furthermore, it is equally important to investigate how learning processes unfold over time through student interactions with information, technology, and other course participants. With this in mind, the second contribution of this research focuses on the development of analytical models that provide insight into these important aspects of inquiry-based learning...|$|R
40|$|This {{study of}} over 2000 US college {{students}} examines the <b>Community</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inquiry</b> framework (<b>CoI)</b> in {{its capacity to}} describe and explain differences in learning outcomes in hybrid and fully online learning environments. We hypothesize that the CoI model’s theoretical constructs of presence reflect educational effectiveness {{in a variety of}} environments, and that online learner self-regulation, a construct that we label “learning presence ” moderates relationships of the other components within the CoI model. Consistent with previous research (e. g., Means, Toyama, Murphy, Bakia & Jones, 2009; Shea & Bidjerano, 2011) we found evidence that students in online and blended courses rank the modalities differently with regard to quality of teaching, social, and cognitive presence. Differences in help seeking behavior, an important component of self-regulated learning, were found as well. In addition, results suggest teaching presence and social presence have a differential effect on cognitive presence, depending upon learner’s online self-regulatory cognitions and behaviors, i. e. their learning presence. These results also suggest a compensation effect in which greater self regulation is required to attain cognitive presence in the absence of sufficient teaching and social presence.

This study provided evidence of factor validity and reliability for data from the OSCS. After the initial EFA-CFA, the four-factor structure held, and 16 of the 25 original items remained for nomological testing. Statistically significant correlations were demonstrated between factors contained in the OSCS, CCS, and COI, providing further evidence of construct validity. These results indicate that for the sample used in this study, the OSCS provides data that are valid and reliable for assessing feelings of connection between participants in online courses at institutions of higher learning...|$|R
