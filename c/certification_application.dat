25|$|Earning a United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) type {{certification}} is {{a precondition}} for the ARJ21-700 to enter the global aviation market. Since 2003, the aviation authorities of China and the USA had been negotiating the ARJ21-700 application for FAA type certification and shadow certification. As a result, the FAA will accept a type <b>certification</b> <b>application</b> for the AVIC I Commercial Aircraft Company’s ARJ21-700 that will be sent by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). The FAA also decided to develop a shadow certification for the ARJ21-700 under current standards and established the CAAC Technology Support Office in Shanghai and Beijing. At the meeting, Luo Ronghuai, assistant general manager of AVIC 1 {{and general manager of}} ACAC, said ACAC would follow the strict airworthiness standards of the CAAC and FAA.|$|E
2500|$|Labor {{certification}} – {{the employer}} must legally {{prove that it}} has a need to hire an alien for a specific position and that there is no minimally qualified U.S. citizen or LPR available to fill that position, hence the reason for hiring the alien. Some of the requirements to prove this situation include: proof of advertising for the specific position; skill requirements particular to the job; verification of the prevailing wage for a position; and the employer's ability to pay. This is currently done through an electronic system known as PERM. [...] The date when the labor <b>certification</b> <b>application</b> is filed becomes the applicant's priority date. In some cases, for highly skilled foreign nationals (EB1 and EB2 National Interest Waiver, e.g. researchers, athletes, artists or business executives) and [...] "Schedule A" [...] labor (nurses and physical therapists), this step is waived. This step is processed by the United States Department of Labor (DOL). [...] The labor certification is valid for 6 months from the time it is approved.|$|E

Although the occupation involved in a labor <b>certification</b> <b>application</b> may be a nonprofessional occupation, the regulations do not prohibit employers from conducting more recruitment than is specified for such occupations. Therefore, if the employer is uncertain whether an occupation is considered professional or not, the employer is advised to conduct recruitment for a professional occupation.|$|E
50|$|As {{with many}} {{immigration}} procedures, labor certification {{tends to be}} controversial. Its backers {{argue that it is}} a rigorous procedure for determining that only foreign workers who truly have skills needed by the US labor market and not readily available locally are hired. Its critics, however, say that US employers will first hire a foreigner on a long-term temporary visa, and then try to tailor the job description so that that foreigner is the only person who could possibly be hired - thus gaming the labor certification process to guarantee a favorable outcome. However, the job requirements, as described by the petitioning employer in the labor <b>certification</b> <b>application,</b> must represent the employer’s actual minimum requirements for the job opportunity. Those job requirements described on a labor <b>certification</b> <b>application</b> are reviewed and evaluated closely by the Department of Labor in accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations that sets forth the standards for determining the appropriate requirements for a job opportunity. Ultimately, the employer must prove that they have not hired workers with less training or experience for jobs substantially comparable to that involved in the job opportunity.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the determinants {{and consequences of}} delay in the union certification process using data from <b>certification</b> <b>applications</b> and unfair labor practice complaints (ULPs) from British Columbia (1986 - 98) and Ontario (1993 - 98). During the period studied, there were several changes in delay-related laws, including laws regulating the presence and stringency of election time limits {{and the availability of}} expedited ULP hearings. Key findings are that ULPs against the employer reduced the likelihood of compliance with time limit laws except where expedited ULP hearings also existed; employer-filed objections to the application reduced the likelihood of compliance; and election delay reduced the likelihood of certification success both in policy regimes without time limits and in those where stipulated time limits were frequently breached. Overall, the results suggest that enforced time limits on elections coupled with expedited ULP hearings may substantially mitigate the adverse effects of election delay on certification success...|$|R
50|$|The US-EPR, {{the version}} of the EPR {{submitted}} to the U.S. regulator, {{is one of the}} competitors {{for the next generation of}} nuclear stations in the United States, along with the AP1000 and the ESBWR. In February 2015 Areva asked to suspend the Design <b>Certification</b> <b>Application</b> Review process at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). It had been under review there with expectation to submit an application for final design approval and standard design certification since 14 December 2007. UniStar, Amarillo Power, PPL Corp and AmerenUE announced plans to file a Combined Construction and Operating License application in 2008 for the US-EPR at its Callaway station. UniStar filed a partial application in July 2007 for a proposed third unit at the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant in Maryland. However, both proposals were subsequently cancelled.|$|E
50|$|The <b>certification</b> <b>application</b> and {{examination}} {{process for}} physicians {{is similar to}} the process for attorneys. Most state bar associations and organizations approved by the American Bar Association to certify attorneys in a particular area of law generally require five or more years of practice in that area, a minimum number of continuing legal education credits in that area, and references from peer attorneys, judges, or others qualified to comment on the attorney applicant's certification candidacy. Examinations vary, but many utilize multiple choice and essay questions to test the attorney's substantive knowledge and experience. For example, the Texas Board of Legal Specialization generally administers a six-hour examination consisting of three hours of essay questions in the morning and three hours of multiple choice questions in the afternoon, although the format varies based on the area of specialty.|$|E
