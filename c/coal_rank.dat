Hoşgörmez et al., (2002) {{determined that the}} coals of the Kozlu Fm exhibit Ro of 1.0 - 1.2% which gives them a <b>coal</b> <b>rank</b> of high volatile A bituminous. Additionally, coalification increased with depth, and the coals became more aromatic with depth. The calorification of the coals also increased with depth.|$|E

50|$|In {{the absence}} {{measured}} methane content of coal beds, and production data from coal bed methane wells, gas content {{can be estimated}} using the Eddy curve. Eddy and others constructed a series of curves estimating maximum producible methane content of coal bed {{as a function of}} depth and rank.The estimation of methane content of a coal bed is determined from the Eddy curve by locating the average depth of each coal seam on the depth axis. A normal line is extended upward from the depth axis (feet) to intersect the specific <b>coal</b> <b>rank</b> curves. A line from the point on the curve is extended normal to the lost and desorbed gas axis(cm3/gm). The intersection of the line and the axis is the estimated methane content of the coal seam.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} sites in Central Scotland at Letham Moss. Most gas in coal is stored on the {{internal}} surfaces of organic matter. Because of its large internal surface area, coal stores 6 to 7 times more gas than the equivalent rock volume of a conventional gas reservoir. Gas content generally increases with <b>coal</b> <b>rank,</b> with depth of burial of the coal bed, and with reservoir pressure. Fractures, or cleats, within coal beds are usually filled with water. Deeper coal beds contain less water, but that water is more saline. Removing water from the coal bed reduces pressure and releases methane. Large amounts of water, sometimes saline brine, are produced from coalbed methane wells. The greatest water volumes are produced {{during the early stages}} of production. Environmentally acceptable disposal of brine is a major cost factor for economic methane production. Fresh water may be discharged on the surface, but brine is usually injected into rock at a depth where the salinity of the injected brine is less than connate fluids of the host rock. Evaporation of water for recovery of potentially salable solid residues might be feasible in regions having high evaporation rates.|$|E
5000|$|Some archaic {{definitions}} of pyrobitumen include peat and lignite, although these materials experienced little geological heating {{compared to that}} required to form fluid bitumen, let alone pyrobitumen. For humic-derived solids in the earth, an analogous position on the coal maturation pathway would place it at a minimum in the medium-volatile bituminous range (i.e., H/C<0.8, O/C<0.05, and vitrinite reflectance >1.0%)., [...] For petroleum systems, Mukhopadhyay states that solid bitumen starts to form when vitrinite reflectance reaches 0.45%, i.e., {{the early stages of}} conversion of kerogen to oil and gas. Bitumen also becomes more reflective with maturity, and he gives an equivalent bitumen reflectance of 0.6% for a vitrinite reflectance of 1.0%, which corresponds to the boundary between asphalt/albertite and epi-impsonite. Although the archaic definition of pyrobitumen includes low-maturity solid bitumens such as albertite, a definition more closely linked to the formation and destruction of oil from kerogen would define pyrobitumen as having an H/C ratio less than 1.0. In fact, the Biomarker Guide defines pyrobitumen as having an H/C ratio less than 0.5, which corresponds to vitrinite reflectance of about 2.0% and low-volatile bituminous to semi-anthracite <b>coal</b> <b>rank.</b> Hwang et al. found that the solubility of solid reservoir bitumens decreased below 50% for a vitrinite reflectance of 0.7% and below 20% for vitrinite reflectance greater than 1.0%, with a vitrinite reflectance of 1.1% corresponding to an atomic H/C ratio of 0.8. Warner et al. also found pyrobitumen in the Tengiz field with H/C of 0.8. They also quote it as having a high reflectivity, including the occurrence of mosaic reflectivity texture. Pyrolysis yielded some oil similar to that from which it was derived. Bordenave describes pyrobitumen as having a reflectivity of between 1.5 and 2.5% and a pyrolysis yield of less than 80 mg hydrocarbon/g organic carbon. From these descriptions and other pyrolysis studies, it becomes clear that the H/C ratio of 0.5 given by Peters corresponds to the end of such pyrolysis yield, even though the bitumen becomes insoluble, and therefore pyrobitumen, prior to that maturity.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{impact of}} coal pore {{structure}} on adsorption-induced matrix swelling of three <b>coals</b> of different <b>ranks</b> was investigated experimentally. The swelling strain measurements for the selected {{samples of the}} two higher <b>rank</b> <b>coals</b> suggested that variation in the sample pore size distribution, particularly the microporosity, has a larger impact on matrix swelling induced by adsorption of CO 2 than by adsorption of less adsorbing gases.

While theoretically settled long ago as being different aspects of coal systems science, the two concepts are still often confounded.

The experimental sorption isotherms fit the Langmuir model over the experimental pressure and temperature ranges. The sorption volumes of all coals tested exhibit a typical temperature behavior with a negative exponent decreasing as temperature increases. An approximately linear correlation for the methane Langmuir volume with <b>coal</b> <b>rank</b> was observed. The effect of <b>coal</b> <b>rank</b> on adsorption volume decreases with increasing temperature. The Langmuir pressure decreases initially with <b>coal</b> <b>rank,</b> reaches a minimum pressure corresponding to the maximum vitrinite reflectance at ∼ 2. 2  % and then increases.

The flame temperature of the FFB was achieved with a mixture of methane, air and oxygen whereas two different gas compositions were used in the DTF to account for sub-stoichiometric (2. 5 % O 2) and close to stoichiometric (10 % O 2) oxygen levels.
