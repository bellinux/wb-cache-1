40|$|Mining, {{processing}} and shipping of bulk commodities has increased to record levels {{over the last}} decade, largely aimed at fuelling the demand for ironmaking and other raw material needs in China. This has required the development of many new ore and mineral resources that are mined below the water table or are subjected to wet mineral processing operations. In other cases, the ores and minerals are simply mined in high rainfall areas. This has made the measurement and control of moisture content a critical issue for safe and economic production and export for most mining companies. It {{is well known that}} the migration of liberated moisture from bulk materials can occur through the materials handling chain from pit to port and beyond. It is not uncommon to observe saturated layers either at the base or on the top of bulk material systems after undergoing some type of vibration or oscillation during its journey. These saturation layers have occurred from train wagon and truck journeys, during belt conveyor transportation, and within the holds of ships during maritime transportation. This research aims to develop a simplified model to estimate moisture migration within a bulk commodity induced by oscillatory ship motions, in particular, during coal shipments. The simplified model integrates likely wave induced ship motions, experimental moisture migration results and likely significant storm occurrences through the transport route. Using the simplified model, two coal cargo journeys from Australia to South East Asia within a Panamax size ship and to Europe in a <b>Cape</b> <b>size</b> ship were assessed. The ship bilge pump records were compared to the predicted model which showed an accuracy of at least 92 % and 96 % for predicting the amount of moisture migrated to the bilges throughout the journey...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn obstetric dilemma {{may have}} been a {{persistent}} characteristic of human evolution, in which the bipedal female's pelvis is barely large enough to accommodate the birth of a large-brained neonate. Evidence in the archaeological record for mortality risk associated with childbirth is rare, especially among highly mobile, immediate return hunter-gatherer populations. This research explores the idea that if excess mortality is associated with first pregnancy, females will outnumber males among young adult skeletons. The sample is of 246 skeletons (119 males, 127 females) representing Later Stone Age (LSA) foragers of the South African Cape. Young adults are distinguished through incomplete maturation of the medial clavicle, iliac crest and vertebral bodies. With 26 women and 14 men in the young category, a higher mortality risk for women is suggested, particularly in the Southern <b>Cape</b> region. Body <b>size</b> does not distinguish mortality groups; there is evidence of a dietary protein difference between young and older women from the Southern Cape. Possible increased mortality associated with first parturition {{may have been}} linked to morphological or energetic challenges, or a combination of both. Exploration of the sex ratio among young adult skeletons provides a tool for exploring the antiquity of an important evolutionary factor...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of {{suitable}} {{sites for}} coal-fired thermal power plants {{is very important}} as there are several such plants to {{come up in the}} future. All generating plants except Upper Kotmale Hydro Power plant in "Long Term Generation Expansion Plan 2009 - 2022 " published by the CEB are coal power plants. Two locations already have been identified for coal power plants at Norochcholei and Sampur for 900 MW and 1000 MW respectively. The study reveals that there is no provision to expand beyond the designed capacity at Norochcholei plant. There is no technical limitation to expand the designed capacity at Sampur plant. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate a further eight proposed sites analyzing following important factors which influence site suitability. These factors are; 1 Supply of coal and transportation facilities on land and at sea 2 Availability of sufficient cooling water and feed water 3 Proximity to the load centers / access to the national grid 4 Distance from populated area (Environmental aspects including impact on the population) 5 Depth of the sea near the coast 6 Availability of sufficient area for power plant, coal storage and ash disposal 7 Other factors 7. 1 Access to the land 7. 2 Topography/ geology 7. 3 Meteorology 7. 4 Hydrogeology 7. 5 Natural hazards Of the eight sites to be evaluated the CEB has identified five tentative locations in its "Long Term Generation Expansion Plan 2009 - 2022 " near Athuruwella, Mawella, Mirijjawela, Karagan Lewaya, and Mirissa along the southern coast. No detailed study has been done for these locations. Hence, initially, these five locations were taken into consideration for the study from among the eight proposed sites. Three additional locations are proposed by the author for consideration along the eastern coast. They are near Panama, Sangamankanda Point and Vakarei. Although CEB proposed Karagan Lewaya to be considered as a site it had to be abandoned subsequently because the GOSL has used this site for the recently commissioned Hambantota harbor. As a result of that the study is carried out based on the other seven proposed sites for detailed evaluation. Sri Lanka has no coal mines, thus coal needs to be imported to the sites from countries such as Indonesia, South Africa or Australia who have indigenous coal mines. Hence coal transporting has to be done by vessels to the site especially with Panamax size vessels and <b>Cape</b> <b>size</b> vessels to keep the cost at a minimum level. Another major factor is the supply sufficient water to the site in order to cool the process and process water. These two factors require that the site has to be close to the coast. It can be seen that the four sites Athuruwella, Mawella, Mirissa and Mirijjawela on the southern coast are close to the populated areas and the lands in the vicinity are ideal for agriculture as well as tourism. Some major resettlement plans are required with a suitable compensation scheme when acquiring the lands for the sites at these four locations in the southern province. In contrast, however, the population density at Panama, Sangamankanda Point and Vakarei in the eastern province is comparatively low but the infrastructure needs to be developed. The grid substations at Ambalangoda, Matara, Hambantota, Ampara and Valachchena are considered as gateways to the national grid from the proposed locations. These can access only the 132 kV grid and needs to be augmented to handle 220 kV at the substation andtransmission lines. Other major factor to be considered is the depth of the sea near the proposed site as this determines how far the vessels can approach the coast and hence estimates the distance of the coal unloading conveyor and the size of the jetty in the sea. Mirijjawela has the advantage of having use of the newly commissioned Hambantota harbor for this purpose as it is about 1 km away from the site. Acquiring of required land area for the proposed site needs to be carefully done. When it is needed to acquire the lands from the residents in the area a reasonable compensation scheme and resettlement plan has to be introduced. Therefore it is of great benefit and cost saving if government owned bare land is available in the proposed areas. Although access to the lands, topography/ geology, meteorology, hydrogeology, natural hazards are minor factors for site selection of a coal power plant, these should also be taken into consideration because the damages can be very high when natural hazards occur like the Tsunami in 2004, although this occurs rarely. The proposed locations should be selected away from any protected wildlife zones, sanctuaries and places with historical values in the country. Then proposed locations are analyzed based on the above factors and for comparison a site validation matrix is prepared with introducing a suitable marking scheme in order to select the best location for the next coal power generation plant...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{being one}} of the most {{productive}} fisheries in the Northwest Atlantic, much remains unknown about the natural reproductive dynamics of American lobsters. Recent work in exploited crustacean populations (crabs and lobsters) suggests that there are circumstances where mature females are unable to achieve their full reproductive potential due to sperm limitation. To examine this possibility in different regions of the American lobster fishery, a reliable and noninvasive method was developed for sampling large numbers of female lobsters at sea. This method involves inserting a blunt-tipped needle into the female 2 ̆ 7 s seminal receptacle to determine {{the presence or absence of}} a sperm plug and to withdraw a sample that can be examined for the presence of sperm. A series of control studies were conducted at the dock and in the laboratory to test the reliability of this technique. These efforts entailed sampling 294 female lobsters to confirm that the presence of a sperm plug was a reliable indicator of sperm within the receptacle and thus, mating. This paper details the methodology and the results obtained from a subset of the total females sampled. Of the 230 female lobsters sampled from George 2 ̆ 7 s Bank and <b>Cape</b> Ann, MA (<b>size</b> range = 71 - 145 mm in carapace length), 90. 3...|$|R
40|$|The {{study is}} about {{evaluating}} supervisor performance at Transnet Port Terminals (TPT) {{and the impact}} {{it has in the}} business world in general. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the quality of supervisors at Transnet Port Terminals (TPT) in the Eastern <b>Cape.</b> The sample <b>size</b> of 43 supervisors working at TPT from different departments like operations, planning, key accounts and procurement participated in the study. The sampled supervisors are between the ages of 20 and 59 years and was composed of females and predominantly males. The data was gathered through a questionnaire that was designed particularly to address the lack of quality of supervisory support at TPT. The response from respondents were tied to themes that were constructed, which are: (a) organisational goals; vision and management competencies; (b) communication; (c) performance cycle-setting of goals; (d) supervisor/supervisee performance conversation; and (e) supervisory development programme. The literature gathered and deliberated on in the literature review emanate from different authors in the form of books, journals and treatises. The empirical results were linked to theories gathered from different authors. Research findings were used to curb the issues identified, which will be beneficial to both TPT and its employees.

40|$|Orientation: Positive {{psychological}} and subjective wellbeing indicators {{have proven to}} be protective against certain physical illnesses but have been rarely assessed in teacher stress. Research purpose: The main objective {{of this study was to}} assess the relationship between indicators of wellbeing and stress and to further assess the relative importance of these wellbeing indicators in explaining stress variance in a large sample of Eastern Cape primary and high school teachers in South Africa. Motivation for the study: The majority of teacher stress studies focus on the misfit between the individual’s resources and the environmental demands. There is a scarcity of studies reporting on protective factors in teaching and we know little about their possible role as possible protective factors against stress. This is important in developing stress prevention strategies. Research design, approach and method: A cross-sectional survey was used targeting public school teachers in the Eastern <b>Cape.</b> The sample <b>size</b> was 562 randomly selected teachers from both public primary and high schools. Main findings: The results revealed that stress is prevalent amongst teachers. Subjective and psychological wellbeing factors added significantly to the explained stress variance. Also, both negative affect and role problems had significant positive correlations with stress, whilst psychological wellbeing had a strong inverse relationship with stress. Practical/managerial implications: The results implied that interventions focusing on improving psychological wellbeing and reduction of negative affect can contribute to stress prevention. Contribution/value-add: The results contributed towards a better understanding of the relative importance of wellbeing constructs as protective factors against teacher stress. </p...|$|R
40|$|To develop {{conservation}} {{strategies for}} vulnerable seabird species that need attention, {{it is important}} to know which factors influence their breeding productivity. Predation of eggs and chicks can have large influences on seabird reproduction, especially when human disturbance facilitates predation. On Dyer Island, Kelp Gulls Larus dominicanus prey on Cape Cormorant Phalacrocorax capensis eggs and chicks, whereas Cape fur seals Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus prey on Cape Cormorant fledglings in the waters surrounding the island. Kelp Gulls were estimated to predate 3. 8 % of the total number of Cape Cormorant eggs and 2. 0 % of the chicks on the island. These percentages can be expressed as a loss of 4. 8 % of Cape Cormorant fledglings, which is low compared to the estimated 24. 3 % mortality of Cape Cormorant fledglings by Cape fur seal predation. Human disturbance facilitated Kelp Gull egg and chick predation and increased the mobbing of cormorant fledglings by Kelp Gulls. Cormorant egg predation by gulls was more frequently reported in the late afternoon. Seal predation was more abundant at the northern side of the island compared to the southern side, was recorded more frequently in the morning, and increased through the breeding season. The altered abundance and distribution of prey, the availability of suitable breeding habitat and mortality from avian cholera, have also influenced the <b>Cape</b> Cormorant’s population <b>size.</b> Hence, the possibility that Cape Cormorants may be locked in a predator-pit, where seals and gulls prevent the population from increasing in size, needs further attention...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{cause of}} {{low temperature breakdown}} (reduction disintegration) is reduction of hematite to magnetite, resulting in a volume expansion and stress relief through the formation of cracks. Serious reduction disintegration causes poor gas permeability, high flue dust production and scaffolding, poor gas distribution, higher fuel consumption and lower productivity. Northern Cape iron ore generally performs well when tested for reduction disintegration properties both for blast furnaces and Corex; nevertheless, significant breakdown is experienced when used in the Corex process (at Saldanha Steel). This study was hence conducted {{to determine the effects}} of the following on reduction disintegration: different ore types (from Northern <b>Cape)</b> initial particle <b>size</b> temperature range reduction gas composition Although disintegration is clearly triggered by reduction, no direct correlation could be established between the percentage reduction and the percentage fines generated. The results indicated that the presence of gangue minerals alone does not cause fractures to form, but does influence the direction and intensity of fractures to some extent. In many cases cracks form randomly, with no specific preference for either gangue minerals or iron oxides. For most of the samples, an incubation period was observed before the first cracks formed. No crack propagation was observed after initial cracking. This study indicates that the degree of reduction disintegration depends mostly on furnace conditions. Reduction disintegration increased with higher hydrogen percentages (> 5 %), higher temperatures (in the 500 ºC- 700 ºC range) and longer exposure. Disintegration of the samples decreased at temperatures higher than 750 °C. For particles smaller than 16 mm an inverse relationship was found between the average particle size and the percentage of fines generated, in line with the observation that most of the disintegration is due to spalling from particle edges rather than particles breaking into smaller clumps. The results indicate that it is important to manage the temperature in the top of the blast furnace and the COREX shaft, and the time spent at temperatures below 750 °C, to minimize the amount of fines generated.

40|$|The Eastern Cape {{contains}} {{the majority of}} the remaining forested areas in South Africa (95. 8 percent Coastal forests and 47. 6 percent Afromontane forests), however these occur in fragments. Due to the rapid rise in the human population and its needs, conversion of forests to agricultural land and the extraction of timber increases, natural vegetation are lost and this therefore leads to forests becoming fragmented into small forest patches. One of the main consequences of forest fragmentation is loss of contiguous habitat, which is the dominant threat to species globally as it negatively affects both species richness and genetic diversity. This research investigates the effects that forest fragmentation has on small mammal diversity and abundance. The study sampled small mammals in Southern Mistbelt Afromontane forest patches in the Eastern Cape. The first aim {{of this study was to}} identify which environmental variable, or combinations of variables, affect the diversity and abundance of small mammals in fragmented forest patches in the Eastern Cape during the austral summer. The second aim was to compare seasonal changes in small mammal diversity and abundance at a forest edge compared to the forest core at Beggars Bush, an Afromontane forest in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. To identify the environmental impacts that different forests have on small mammals, nine different forests were chosen in the Eastern Cape and sampled during the summer in 2013. These nine forests were: Fort Fordyce Forest, Thaba Ndoda Forest, Hogsback Forest, Dassie Kraans Forest, Langeni Forest, Burchell’s Reserve Forest, Maiden Dam Forest and Kagaberg Forest. At each site, three transects of 30 Sherman Traps each were used. Trapping periods within each forest patch lasted between three to five consecutive nights and traps were inspected once a day in the morning. Nine environmental variables were initially identified and after being tested for normality and colinearity, five variables were chosen. These variables were Altitude, Mean Annual Temperature, Gradient, Patch Size and Mean annual potential evaporation. The number of individuals captures and species richness were then incorporated as dependent variables for best subset multiple regression model selection using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). For the second aim, the same trapping methods were used when comparing seasonal changes to diversity and abundance within the forest core. However at the forest edge, due to the small size of the forest, only 20 Sherman traps were used in each transect with five traps (25 percent) placed in the grassland and 15 (75 percent) placed in the forest along each transect. This study was one of few to survey small mammal diversity and abundance in fragmented forests in the Eastern <b>Cape.</b> Gradient, patch <b>size</b> and mean annual potential evaporation were the variables that best predicted the individual number of small mammal captures while only gradient best explained species richness. It does however, need to be noted that capture rates and species richness were very low and this would therefore effect the analysis of environmental variables. Future studies should have a larger sample size of forest patches and include more microhabitat environmental variables to determine their effects on small mammal diversity and abundance. However, it should be noted that through climatic extinction filtering, forest mammals are resilient generalists that can tolerate fragmentation effects. Furthermore, it was found that forest edges appear to play a significant role in small mammal diversity and abundance in the Beggars Bush Afromontane forest. Some species were habitat specialists such as Rhabdomys pumilio preferring the grassland habitat and Graphiurus murinus and Aethomys namaquensis the forest habitat, while Myosorex varius was the only species that was not habitat dependant. It was found that there was a greater diversity and abundance at the forest edge compared to within the forest core throughout most of the seasons. One possible flaw was that the sampling methods were different at the edge and within the forest and therefore future studies should ensure that the method stays uniform throughout the study...|$|R
