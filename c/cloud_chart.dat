The static structure analysis for the model provides stress and strain distribution <b>cloud</b> <b>charts.</b> The modal analysis provides the basis of dynamic analysis due to its ability to obtain the natural frequencies and the vibration–made vectors of the first 10 orders. The results show the main faults are attrition and cracks, while also indicating the locations and patterns of faults. The harmonic response simulation was performed to gain the vibration response of the flywheel under operation. In this paper, we present a Hilbert–Huang transform (HHT) algorithm for flywheel vibration analysis. The simulation indicated that the proposed flywheel vibration signal analysis method performs well, {{which means that the}} method can lay the foundation for the detection and diagnosis in a reactor main coolant pump...|$|R

Aim for calculating stress {{intensity}} factor (short for SIF) of different position plates with eccentric crack, and the change tendency between different positions and SIF, the crack model is built by finite element software, and the SIF change tendency line with different width plates is got. It is seen from the von Mises stress <b>cloud</b> <b>chart</b> of ANSYS that the deformation of plate is effected by crack; {{as the center of}} crack is gradually close to the edge of plate, SIF is increasing. When the distance between the center and edge of crack is decreasing down to 3 / 8, SIF is increasing fiercely, that means, the plate at this time has already reached the edge of fracture. If continue loading the stretch, the crack will be apparent on the plate. And the curvature equation is got by index decay adapting...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIf {{a long-distance}} gas {{pipeline}} is unavoidably buried under a planned high-filling road, the high fill subgrade setting {{will result in}} the change of the pipe's mechanical shape and the local stress concentration on the pipe, which will pose threats to the safe operation of the pipeline. Protection culverts are generally adopted to solve this issue, but the construction of protection culverts are difficult and high in cost and usually unable to meet the requirements of construction schedule of the planned road project by the local government. For this reason, the stress on pipelines in high fill subgrade was analyzed and a rectification measure was proposed and its safety and rationality was also calculated. The results show that increasing pipe thickness is a feasible rectification measure. Thus, we analyzed the stability of and stress on the pipe caused by the uneven high fill setting by using the ABAQUS finite element software package, in which the pipe was simulated as the beam element, the backfill above the pipe as the stress load, and the elastic foundation underneath the pipe as the evenly-distributed spring. From the stress <b>cloud</b> <b>charts,</b> we can see the stress concentration on the pipe where a sudden change occurs in high fill setting. Without proper measures, accidents would be inevitable in the end. The analysis results from the ABAQUS also show that the scheme of increasing the pipe thickness will be the most cost-effective and practical {{way to deal with the}} stress resulted from the uneven high fill setting above the pipe. But it is pointed out that the pipeline laying route should avoid planned high filling roads as far as possible to ensure its safe operation...|$|R

Infrared HRIT image location has been diagnosed by landmark matching evaluation. The latest evaluation shows that the image location error is within a pixel by standard deviation. The observed images have been compared to GOES- 9 simultaneous observations to evaluate the calibration of the MTSAT- 1 R infrared channels. The result shows that MTSAT- 1 R IR 1, IR 2, and IR 3 are well calibrated and no particular systematic error is found. The calibration of the MTSAT- 1 R visible channel has been also studied. It is possible that the trend monitor of the MTSAT- 1 R visible channel may indicate a sign of a slow transient change in the range of albedo larger than 0. 11 until August 2005. From September, the trend of MTSAT- 1 R cooresponds to that of GOES- 9, and no clear change is recognized.

The set is heavily marked and annotated by Melville, and this marginalia provides insight on the development of his thought. But besides a single critical essay by R. W. B Lewis published in 1950, Melville’s marginalia to Homer has never received extensive analysis and criticism {{in the form of a}} focused study. According to Lewis, Melville essentially channeled the tragic world view of Moby-Dick into his reading of Homer. Our research is scrutinizing Lewis’s claims, acknowledging a darker component in what Melville chose to mark, but also addressing marked and annotated passages that do not necessarily reflect a tragic viewpoint. There are many of these in the set, and Lewis’s analysis generally disregards them. The result of our research will be a multi-faceted and nuanced understanding of how Melville responded to these two foundational epic poems. Along with identifying parallel elements between Melville’s marginalia to Homer and Moby-Dick, we also explore the ways Melville’s thought appears to have developed following the completion of his masterwork. In order to analyze the text and Melville’s marginalia, we are using quantitative analytical software that illustrates word frequencies and co-occurrences in text marked by Melville, as well as traditional close reading skills.

40|$|For {{hundreds}} of years, sails provided {{the means for}} trade between distant places, for exploration and territorial expansion.
