The Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) {{are able}} to take {{multiple}} overlapped images of the study site {{at a very high}} spatial and temporal resolution. These image series have to be ortho-mosaiced to cover the whole target area. The UAV ortho-mosaics are turning into an important tool for the development of precision agriculture strategies, in particular for accurate prescription maps for site specific weed management (SSWM) at early grow stages, These stages require to discriminate small plants (crop and weeds) that can not be detected using other remote platforms with coarse spatial resolution. Recent studies on crop-weed discrimination at early stages are focused on <b>crop</b> <b>line</b> detection as the first step for a further discrimination of crop and weeds emerged between the crop rows due to plants which are not located in the crop lin e can be assumed as weeds. However, due to the instability of UAV and image distortion, some of the single images which compose the ortho-mosaic do not fit perfectly which would cause no correspondence between crop row alignment of two overlapped images. This study investigated the geometric accuracy differences among ortho-mosaics created from a UAV image series taken at three different flight altitudes (30, 60 and 100 m). The effect of <b>crop</b> <b>line</b> misalignment of the final mosaics was also evaluated according to these flight altitudes. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AGROSUPSPEEAGESTADIn {{the present}} agroecological context, the {{reduction}} of herbicide uses becomes a substantial issue. For weed control and site specific weed management {{the development of new}} technologies is required to identify individual plant. Although many crop/weed discrimination methods have been developed, the automatic intra-row weed detection is still a challenge, particularly in wheat. An imaging system is developed to detect black grass in wheat at early growing stage. The technique mimics the method used by a human expert in such conditions. Thus, the hypocotyl diameter was used as distinguishing criterion. For experiments, the seeds of black grass and wheat were sown in rectangular pots. Two planting protocols were carried out to reproduce the emergence difference of species as observed in actual field conditions: 1) black grass and wheat were planted in the <b>crop</b> <b>line</b> at the same time; 2) black grass were planted in the <b>crop</b> <b>line</b> seven days after wheat. The imaging system consisted in a multispectral camera placed at 1. 20 m above the pot soil surface. The view axis was tilted at 45 ° so that the side view of the crop row was captured in the image. Approximately 100 images were acquired at various times from plant emergence (BBCH-stage 11) to three leaf stage (BBCH-stage 13) of the wheat plant. The first step of image processing consisted in computing a color vegetation index (Excess Green Index) and thresholding the pixel values to provide a binary image of the plants without soil background. In the second step, various segmentation and filtering techniques were assessed to detect automatically the base of plant stems. Depending on the stem width, each plant was finally classified into wheat or black grass. Results are analyzed and discussed looking at the potential of this method regarding not only the plant species but also experimental conditions...|$|E
40|$|Overall, the <b>crop</b> <b>lines</b> are a {{reflection}} of the creviced pattern of the underlying karst bedrock and associated karst aquifer, and reveal the degree and extent of karstification in eastern Jo Daviess County. The <b>crop</b> <b>lines</b> were consistent with the angular lines of adjacent streams that show a rectangular drainage pattern. Stream patterns like these are well known and are due to drainage controlled by crevice/fracture patterns in the top of bedrock. The lines appear to have been formed by two sets of fractures trending roughly north-south and east-west with occasional cross-cutting fractures/ crevices. The east-west trending lines are consistent with tension joints, and the north-south lines are consistent with the shear joints identified by earlier researchers. The trends of the <b>crop</b> <b>lines,</b> tension and shear joints {{are similar to those of}} lineaments identified from LiDAR elevation data in the same area (N 20 ° W, and N 70 ° W and N 70 ° E) and coincide with the occurrence of karst features throughout eastern Jo Daviess County.

40|$|High spatial {{resolution}} images taken by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) {{have been shown}} to have the potential for monitoring agronomic and environmental variables. However, it is necessary to capture a large number of overlapped images that must be mosaicked together to produce a single and accurate ortho-image (also called an ortho-mosaicked image) representing the entire area of work. Thus, ground control points (GCPs) must be acquired to ensure the accuracy of the mosaicking process. UAV ortho-mosaics are becoming an important tool for early site-specific weed management (ESSWM), as the discrimination of small plants (crop and weeds) at early growth stages is subject to serious limitations using other types of remote platforms with coarse {{spatial resolution}}s, such as satellite or conventional aerial platforms. Small changes in flight altitude are crucial for low-altitude image acquisition because these variations can cause important differences in the spatial resolution of the ortho-images. Furthermore, a decrease of flying altitude reduces the area covered by each single overlapped image, which implies an increase of both the sequence of images and the complexity of the image mosaicking procedure to obtain an ortho-image covering the whole study area. This study was carried out in two wheat fields naturally infested by broad-leaved and grass weeds at a very early phenological stage. The geometric accuracy differences and <b>crop</b> <b>line</b> alignment among ortho-mosaics created from UAV image series were investigated while taking into account three different flight altitudes (30, 60 and 100 m) and a number of GCPs (from 11 to 45). The results did not show relevant differences in geo-referencing accuracy on the interval of altitudes studied. Similarly, the increase of the number of GCPs did not imply a relevant increase of geo-referencing accuracy. Therefore, the most important parameter to consider when choosing the flying altitude is the ortho-image spatial resolution required rather than the geo-referencing accuracy. Regarding the crop mis-alignment, the results showed that the overall errors were less than twice the spatial resolution, which did not break the <b>crop</b> <b>line</b> continuity at the studied spatial resolutions (pixels from 7. 4 to 24. 7 mm for 30, 60 and 100 m flying altitudes respectively) on the studied crop (early wheat). The results lead to the conclusion that a UAV flying at a range of 30 to 100 m altitude and using a moderate number of GCPs is able to generate ultra-high spatial resolution ortho-imagesortho-images with the geo-referencing accuracy required to map small weeds in wheat at a very early phenological stage.

In this study, the anisotropies of the spatial variability of soil CO 2 emissions and of other soil properties were determined for a sugarcane production area under mechanical harvest, when crop residues are left on soil surface, located in the northeastern part of the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The anisotropic characterization of variables was performed by deriving the fractal dimension (DF) from experimental semivariograms calculated at angles of 0 °, 45 °, 90 ° and 135 ° from the between <b>crop</b> <b>line</b> direction (0 °). The mean FCO 2 was 2. 19 μmol m− 2 s− 1, and values were significantly lower in the 0 ° direction. A principal component analysis was applied to study soil properties and the first principal component was mainly related to soil physical properties and FCO 2. A multiple regression analysis indicated that air-filled pore space (AFPS) was the main factor affecting the spatial variability of FCO 2 in all directions. The AFPS DF values were significantly lower in the direction in which sugarcane crops were planted, indicating anisotropy of this property and greater homogeneity in this direction. Even after rainfall, there was no change in the structure of spatial variability as expressed by the values of DF. The results indicate that in sugarcane areas, several factors inherent to soil forming processes and management practices during harvest and seeding were responsible for the observed anisotropy, which affected soil CO 2 emissions...|$|E

Todos os tratos culturais foram realizados com base na recomendação para a cultura (Filgueira, 2000), sendo aplicados concomitantemente nos três experimentos. A seqüência de duas, três e quatro plantas na linha de cultivo formou as parcelas de duas, três e quatro unidades básicas de tamanho. Foram realizadas análises considerando-se apenas colheitas individuais e colheitas agrupadas. Foram estimados a variância, o coeficiente de variação e o índice de informação relativa. Aplicou-se o teste de Bartlett entre as variâncias das colheitas individuais e agrupadas em cada tamanho de parcela simulado para verificar sua homogeneidade. As variâncias, entre as colheitas agrupadas, são homogêneas a partir do agrupamento de seis colheitas.

40|$|The shikimic acid pathway {{is one of}} {{the major}} biosynthetic {{pathways}} in higher plants responsible for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine) and multiple secondary metabolites, such as lignin, phytoalexins and indoleacetic acid (IAA). The herbicide glyphosate [N-(phosohonomethyl) glycine] is a non-selective, broad spectrum, post emergence, foliar applied, systemic herbicide that is used globally to control over 180 weed species. Glyphosate is a potent inhibitor of a key enzyme in the shikimic acid pathway namely; 5 -enolpyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase (EPSPS), which is the only cellular target for this herbicide. Upon inhibition of EPSPS by glyphosate, shikimate, the dephosphorylated substrate of EPSPS which is upstream of this enzyme in the pathway, cannot be converted to 5 -enolpyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate (EPSP). Blockage of the shikimic acid pathway consequently results in the accumulation of high levels of shikimate. Since shikimate accumulation is a direct result of herbicide inhibition of EPSPS, shikimate can be used as a convenient biomarker to measure glyphosate exposure, glyphosate damage as well as the degree of glyphosate resistance. Glyphosate resistance is conferred in glyphosate resistant (GR) crops also known as Roundup Ready® (RR) crops by incorporating a glyphosate tolerant CP 4 -EPSPS gene from the CP 4 strain of Agrobacterium which encodes for a bacterial version of the EPSPS that is highly insensitive to glyphosate. When this enzyme (CP 4 -EPSPS) is expressed and present in RR crops it enables the plant to bypass the glyphosate inhibited native EPSPS in the shikimic acid pathway, thereby allowing the plant to complete the shikimic acid pathway (aromatic amino acid biosynthesis) by making use of the alternative enzyme, thus preventing aromatic amino acid and protein starvation and deregulation of this metabolic route, both of which follow glyphosate treatment in susceptible plants. Thus, RR crops are unaffected by herbicide treatment. Since glyphosate inhibits the EPSPS in susceptible (non-RR) crops, but not in a RR <b>crop</b> <b>line,</b> differences in the shikimate levels occur between these crop lines after glyphosate exposure. The main aims of this study were to quantify shikimic acid levels in Roundup Ready® and non-RR crops after being treated with glyphosate (Roundup Turbo®) by making use of high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis as well as a colourimetric assay, and to use these two assays to differentiate between glyphosate resistant and susceptible plants after being exposed to glyphosate. These assays were also used to indicate whether glyphosate was responsible for herbicide damage in maize plants due to drift. Plant tissues sensitive to glyphosate accumulate shikimic acid to high levels after glyphosate treatment. The detection of shikimic acid has been shown to be a useful marker as a measure of glyphosate injury or to score for glyphosate sensitive and resistant weed biotypes. Up to now, the most common methods for shikimic acid assay include: spectrophotometry, capillary zone electrophoresis, HPLC with UV detection, and the periodate oxidation, or Cromartie and Polge, method. Here we introduce a new method for shikimic acid detection which has a broad application, is colourimetric, sensitive, simple and very quick to use. The method can be used for quantification in plant extracts using a microtiter plate, and can be further adapted for detection of shikimic acid in intact leaf discs or other plant tissues.

40|$|The North Tyrrhenian Sea {{separates}} Corsica {{from the}} Tuscany coast {{and it is}} subdivided into three sectors with different morphological and geological characteristics: the Corsica Basin, the Elba-Pianosa Ridge and the Tuscan Shelf. The North Tyrrhenian Sea {{is considered to be}} an extensional basin formed during the post-collisional phases of the Northern Apennines. It is filled by up to 8. 5 km of Eocene to Recent deposits unconformably lying on Cretaceous or older strata. The aim of this work is to present the main features of the seismic line CROP-M 12 A and provide a linkage between this line and the inland CROP- 03 profiles. The M 12 A line crosses the Tuscan Shelf from SW-NE, south of Elba Island from the Elba-Pianosa Ridge to the Punta Ala promontory. The Corsica Basin is bounded to the west by an east-dipping master fault (the Solenzara fault) active in Oligocene times and reactivated in the Late Miocene. To the east the basin is flanked by the Elba-Pianosa Ridge. Industrial and deep seismic profiles indicate that the sedimentary fill of the Corsica Basin is up to 6. 5 sec (TWT) thick, and that it is composed of Oligocene to Quaternary poorly deformed strata resting on Eocene deformed strata, in turn resting on the acoustic basement, probably composed of calcschists. The Elba-Pianosa Ridge has been drilled by the two wells Martina 1 -Mimosa 1 and it is crossed by the <b>CROP</b> <b>line</b> M 12 A. The submerged part of the ridge is mainly composed of a thick Eocene-Early Miocene siliciclastic succession. Only at Pianosa Island, where the top of the ridge is emerged, are Lower Miocene-Quaternary deposits exposed. The Oligocene deposits are well-imaged on seismic line CROP M 12 A and have been penetrated by the two wells; their thickness reduces towards the Tuscany coast from 2. 0 sec TWT (about 3000 m) to 0. 7 sec TWT (about 800 m). Industrial seismic profiles across the Tuscan Shelf show that Oligocene deposits are folded and thrusted eastwards and that Burdigalian-Langhian sedimentary fill occurred the thrust-top basins. Evidence of a post-Oligocene deformational phase has recently been documented by the stratigraphic revision of the Mimosa 1 well, where the tectonic repetition of the Eocene series has been recognised. A suite of basins filled by about 2500 m of Late Miocene-Quaternary deposits, resting unconformably on the acoustic basement, characterise {{the eastern part of the}} Tuscan Shelf. Basins formed as half-grabens during Late Miocene-Early Pliocene times, and hilly post-rift conditions occurred in the Pleistocene. East-dipping basin master faults show listric geometry and can be followed down to 3. 0 sec TWT. The acoustic basement of the eastern part of the Tuscan Shelf is represented by the Mesozoic carbonate rocks of the Tuscan Nappe. CROP-M 12 A analysis underlines that the Montecristo High is one of the major structures of the Tuscan Shelf. Similarly to the Middle Tuscany Ridge, it is bounded by opposite verging faults. The western NE-verging thrust was reactivated as a normal fault in the Late Miocene. The thrust can be followed throughout the whole Tuscan Shelf and affects the crust down to about 15 km. The prominent reflections at depths of 7. 0 and 8. 0 sec TWT are interpreted to be the Moho. The shallow reflection is interpreted to be the Apenninic Moho, and the deep reflection to be the Tyrrhenian Moho...|$|E
40|$|Obtaining {{transgenic}} <b>crop</b> <b>lines</b> with stable {{levels of}} carotenoids is highly desirable. We addressed this issue by employing the anther culture technique to develop dihaploid lines containing genes involved in b-carotene metabolism. First, we used Agrobacterium- mediated transformation to develop primary transgenic plants containing the b-carotene biosynthetic genes, phytoene synthase (psy) and phytoene desaturase (crtI), which were engineered for expression and accumulation in the endosperm. Transgenic plants were recovered by selecting for {{the expression of}} the phosphomannose isomerase (pmi) gene. Dihaploid plants in addition to haploid and tetraploid plant were generated from anther cultures of these primary transgenic plants. In addition to anatomical features of stomata, pollen of different ploidy-plants, molecular analyses confirmed the stable integration of the genes in the anther culture-derived dihaploid plants, and the yellow color of the polished seeds indicated the accumulation of carotenoids in the endosperm. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the carotenoid extract further confirmed the levels of b–carotene accumulation in the endosperms of the transgenic dihaploid rice seeds...|$|R
50|$|Previous studies {{discussed}} the gizzard (i.e. a muscular oesophageal <b>crop</b> <b>lined</b> with cuticula) with gizzard plates as homologous apomorphic structures supporting a clade composed of Cephalaspidea s.s., Pteropoda and Anaspidea. A gizzard with gizzard plates probably originated in herbivorous taxa {{in which it}} worked like a grinding mill, thus might be secondarily reduced in carnivorous groups within Cephalaspidea s.s. and Gymnosomata. Klussmann-Kolb and Dinapoli considered the gizzard in Umbraculoidea as non-homologous with {{the one in the}} previous groups, on account of the absence of gizzard plates or spines. This contradicted Salvini-Plawen and Steiner, who had proposed the gizzard to be a synapomorphy of the larger clade of Paratectibranchia (Pteropoda, Cephalaspidea and Anaspidea) and Eleutherobranchia, secondarily lost in Nudipleura but still present in Umbraculoidea. As coded in Wägele and Klussmann-Kolb, phylogenetic hypothesis by Jörger et al. (2010) supports homology of the gizzard in Umbraculoidea with the gizzard with gizzard plates and spines in the other euopisthobranchian taxa. Thus, the structure is proposed as a synapomorphy of Euopisthobranchia.|$|R
