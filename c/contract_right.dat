500|$|In his 1910 book, The Constitutional Law of the United States, Westel W. Willoughby {{noted that}} the court's ruling that an {{elective}} office was not property was at odds with previous decisions in which it had assumed jurisdiction in cases between two contestants for an office to determine if due process was granted. By assuming jurisdiction in these cases, Willoughby claimed, the court had given elective offices standing as property. Accordingly, Justice Joseph McKenna issued a separate concurring opinion in which he stated: [...] "I agree fully with those decisions which are referred to , and which hold that as between the State and the office holder there is no <b>contract</b> <b>right</b> either to the term of office or {{to the amount of}} salary, and that the legislature may, if not restrained by constitutional provisions, abolish the office or reduce the salary. But when the office is not disturbed, when the salary is not changed, and when, under the Constitution of the State, neither can be by the legislature, and the question is simply whether one shall be deprived of that office and its salary, and both given to another, a different question is presented, and in such a case to hold that the incumbent has no property in the office, with its accompanying salary, does not commend itself to my judgment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Hunt {{indicates}} {{that she had}} no great musical talent, she worked as a singer for 18 months after arriving in England. In February 1967, Hunt took a singing job with Alexis Korner's trio [...] "Free at Last" [...] so that she could earn her fare back home. She did not use it, but remained, and in 1968, joined the group The Ferris Wheel. That same year, Hunt achieved national fame in England when she appeared as [...] "Dionne" [...] in the rock musical Hair, a box-office smash on the London stage. Hunt only had two lines of dialogue in Hair, but she attracted a lot of media attention and her photo appeared in many newspapers and magazines. Her photograph was used on the poster and playbill of the original London production, photographed by Justin de Villeneuve. Hunt says that the role was a perfect fit for her, expressing who she actually was. She was one of three Americans featured in the London show, and when the show began she had no contract to perform. When the show opened she was featured in so many stories that she was offered a <b>contract</b> <b>right</b> away.|$|E

40|$|We {{present and}} test empirically {{a new theory}} of {{property}} and <b>contract</b> <b>rights.</b> Any incentive an autocrat has to respect such rights comes from his interest in future tax collections and national income and increases with his planning horizon. We find a compelling empirical relationship between property and <b>contract</b> <b>rights</b> and an autocrat's time in power. In lasting [...] but not in new [...] democracies, the same {{rule of law and}} individual rights that ensure continued free elections entail extensive property and <b>contract</b> <b>rights.</b> We show that the age of a democratic system is strongly correlated with property and <b>contract</b> <b>rights.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn the {{new stage}} of rural reform, faced {{universal}} transfer of land <b>contract</b> <b>rights,</b> {{one of the}} most important tasks of rural system construction is accelerating development of agricultural insurance in China. However, agricultural insurance does not function efficiently enough to accord effective protection to farmers in land <b>contract</b> <b>rights</b> transfer, and agricultural insurance and transfer of land <b>contract</b> <b>rights</b> become a dual dilemma. To address this difficulty, agricultural insurance is premised to improve the implementation of land <b>contract</b> <b>rights</b> transfer, in which appropriate safeguards are acquired. Thus, the introduction of game theory is necessary and feasible for analyzing the strategy by which farmers select agricultural insurance and land contracts. Based on game analysis, the “players” are the agricultural insurance and land contracts encountered by farmers; “strategy” is composed of agricultural insurance and land contract selection behaviors. Farmer behavior can achieve equilibrium of anticipated profits. Equilibrium then yields the “outcome,” which is the cooperation and win-win solutions that may be achieved between agricultural insurance and transfer of land <b>contract</b> <b>rights.</b> Thus, in the rational selection process of farmers, agricultural insurance and transfer of land <b>contract</b> <b>rights</b> can facilitate positive support, interaction, and development. These will help realize overall progress in system innovation with respect to agricultural insurance...|$|R

50|$|The new {{ownership}} group {{sought to}} be much more frugal than the free-spending Sharks had been. One notable example of this was that while the Sharks' headquarters had been located in a large suite atop a skyscraper in downtown Jacksonville, the offices of the Express were located in a mall {{in the basement of a}} hotel. Accordingly, the franchise was able to meet its financial obligations throughout its short existence. However, the WFL had lost their television <b>contract</b> <b>right</b> before the 1975 season, putting the entire league in serious financial difficulty. The Express had compiled a 6-5 record when the WFL folded in October 1975, 11 games into a planned 20-game schedule.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "royalty" [...] also covers areas {{outside of}} IP and {{technology}} licensing, such as oil, gas, and mineral royalties {{paid to the}} owner of a property by a resources development company in exchange for the right to exploit the resource. In a business project the promoter, financier, LHS enabled the transaction but are no longer actively interested may have a royalty right to a portion of the income, or profits, of the business. This sort of royalty is often expressed as a <b>contract</b> <b>right</b> to receive money based on a royalty formula, rather than an actual ownership interest in the business.

This experiment took place with weak institutions to enforce <b>contract</b> <b>rights.</b> It also took place without institutions that encourage prudent behavior by bankers. The result was reckless behavior by banks, and {{a collapse of}} the banking system. In the second experiment (1997 - 2003), Mexico reformed many of the institutions that promoted bank monitoring and it opened up the industry to foreign investment. It was less successful, however, in reforming the institutions that promote the enforcement of <b>contract</b> <b>rights.</b> The result was that bankers behaved prudently, but prudent behavior {{in the context of}} weak <b>contract</b> <b>rights</b> implies that banks are reluctant to extend credit to firms and households...|$|R

50|$|It {{was during}} his years at the Academy of Music that Havasi’s ability to impress the non-musical {{audience}} first became apparent. This realisation led EMI to offer the young artist a five-year exclusive record <b>contract</b> <b>right</b> after graduation. Havasi, who had only been familiar with classical music before, made his first contact with the concepts of marketing, communication and mass media. While the artistic views of the record company mismatched the artist’s long-term ambitions as a composer, Havasi later drew on his communication experiences acquired in that period to popularise his own music. During the term of his EMI contract, he produced two soundtrack albums. On the day of expiry, Havasi did not extend the contract but established his own record company to create the musical world he had always longed for.|$|E
50|$|A fiend cannot {{alter the}} terms of their deal or fail to abide by them. They also cannot {{directly}} influence the mortal.

[...] Another example came in Bennett v. Nichols, 9 Arizona 138 (1905), a case involving the legislatures ability to grant a 20-year tax exemption to a railroad.

The legal issues continue in these cases, and there may be issues that will take the cases back into the appellate court system of Tennessee.|$|E
