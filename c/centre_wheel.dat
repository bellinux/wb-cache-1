50|$|Four general {{styles of}} powerchair drive systems exist: front, centre or {{rear wheel drive}} and all-wheel drive. Powered wheels are {{typically}} somewhat larger than the trailing/castoring wheels, while castoring wheels are typically larger than the castors on a manual chair. <b>Centre</b> <b>wheel</b> drive powerchairs have castors at both front and rear for a six-wheel layout.|$|E
50|$|A safety pinion was an {{alternate}} means of protection, {{used with the}} going barrel. In this, the <b>centre</b> <b>wheel</b> pinion, which the barrel gear engages, was attached to its shaft with a reverse screw thread. If the spring broke, the reverse recoil of the barrel, instead of being {{passed on to the}} gear train, would simply unscrew the pinion.|$|E
50|$|The {{cars were}} built over a steel truss underframe, with wooden bodies {{constructed}} with cedar and clerestory roofs to give ventilation and daytime lighting. Nighttime lighting was initially provided with Pintsch gas, and six-wheeled bogies with eight brake blocks each (two outside the outer wheels and two each per <b>centre</b> <b>wheel)</b> under all vehicles. Drop-toilets for both genders were provided in all passenger vehicles except the dining cars, along with staff toilets in the twelve mail vans.|$|E

50|$|Wheel train: A {{gear train}} that transmits {{the force of}} the power source to the escapement. Large gears known as wheels mesh with small gears known as pinions. The wheels in a typical going train are the <b>centre</b> <b>wheel,</b> third wheel, and fourth wheel. A {{separate}} set of wheels, the motion work, divides the motion of the minute hand by 12 to move the hour hand and in watches another set, the keyless work, allows the hands to be set.|$|E
5000|$|In watchmaking {{the term}} [...] "wheel" [...] usually means a large {{gear with teeth}} on its {{periphery}} - great wheel, <b>centre</b> <b>wheel,</b> third wheel, etc. The [...] "balance wheel" [...] has no teeth and therefore is not a wheel in this sense. Some recognise this and {{refer to it as}} simply the [...] "balance". For instance Jendritzki (Swiss) and de Carle (English) use the term [...] "balance" [...] rather than [...] "balance wheel". It appears that the term balance wheel is used in America, although the great American watchmaker Henry Fried, described in his obituary in The New York Times as [...] "the dean of American watchmakers" [...] also used the term balance rather than balance wheel.|$|E
5000|$|XE, GE: 1118cc E1A or 1294cc G1A OHV Simca engine, X {{with three}} doors and G with five doors. The 1118 cc engine {{came with a}} four speed gearbox, whilst the 1294 cc came with a five speed gearbox. Standard {{equipment}} was sparse, featuring a rear bench seat, heated rear window, small wheel <b>centre</b> <b>wheel</b> covers, {{as well as a}} flick wipe facility. Options included a rear wash/wipe, side bump strips on the doors, and a pop up sunroof. Many special editions were based on the X/GE, such as the Sport model, which came with a spoiler and side decals; and also the Sunseeker model, which came with a pop-up sunroof, and side decals. In some markets a diesel E model was also available, using the 1905 cc XUD engine. All diesel models carry the D suffix on the model badge (XLD, GLD). The Special Equipment model available in the UK in 1989 also added a pop up sunroof and a rear wash/wipe to the standard equipment list. The E designation was replaced by the Style designation, which began as a special edition in 1987, but became a part of the range from 1988, to denote the base model, in line with other contemporary Peugeot models of the time (e.g. the Peugeot 205 Style and the Peugeot 405 Style). The Style was also available with the 1124 cc and 1360 cc TU and 1905 cc XUD (Style D) engines, all with 5 speed gearboxes, after the Simca units were phased out.|$|E
5000|$|To {{raise the}} bridge an initial lift {{to the inner}} end of the bridge is required. This raises the inner wheels back up the {{inclines}} of the granite slabs. At {{the same time the}} outer ends are pulled from the lip of the granite slab, the wheels rolling down the sprung metal guides. When the inner wheels are pulled up onto the metal trays the weight of the lifting arms assists the raising of the bridge to a point where the centre of gravity of the arms is over the pivot of the upper support stays. From here on the pull necessary to raise the <b>centre</b> <b>wheels</b> is negligible. Once the lifting arms are in the fully retracted position the <b>centre</b> <b>wheels</b> are on top of the metal trays and the axles disengage from the cups. The bridge now sits on its inner two axles. From here it is necessary to pull the bridge in until the outer two wheels arrive at the trays. The bridge is then pulled within the gates on all six wheels.|$|R

50|$|The use {{of tires}} is {{becoming}} obsolete. The utilisation of traditional freight wagons was often {{so low that}} tires never needed renewal, so it was cheaper to fit a one-piece ("monoblock") wheel. Monoblock wheels are lighter and offer better integrity {{as there is no}} tire to come loose. Modern flow-line repair lines are disrupted by the inspection of the <b>wheel</b> <b>centre</b> once the tire is removed, possibly generating extra rectification work, and the need to make each tire fit its allocated <b>wheel</b> <b>centre.</b> Monoblock <b>wheels</b> are now more economical.|$|R
40|$|Recent mineral {{exploration}} in South Australia {{has resulted in}} many kilometres of tracks cleared in areas of natural vegetation. This study investigates the impact of linear disturbance in formerly pristine mallee vegetation on sand dunes in central Eyre Peninsula. Paired measurements and samples were taken in the main topographic positions (crest, slope, footslope and swale) along ~ 400 m of each of three tracks, and closely adjacent undisturbed sites. The tracks were sampled across microtopographic features: <b>centre,</b> <b>wheel</b> rut, shoulder. Measurements of physical characters of soil included: compaction, bulk density, structure, water content, erosion. Chemical characters assessed were: soil nutrients, pH, conductivity, soil carbon (total), along with litter distribution. Vegetation composition and processes were characterised by measuring: soil seedbank emergence, abundance of annual and perennial plants, seed predation by ants, effect of litter on seedling emergence, weed invasion potential, perennial regrowth on the tracks and growth of planted seedlings, soil crust and mycorrhizae. Soil compaction and bulk density {{were higher in the}} swale and wheel rut on the tracks. The swale had higher soil water content for all positions across the tracks and in the undisturbed area, while the wheel rut had more than the other positions. In the swale soil dried out at a similar rate in the wheel rut and undisturbed area, whereas at the crest the wheel rut dried out fastest. After heavy rainfall there was more soil movement down the slope on the tracks than in the undisturbed area. Soil nutrients were higher in the swale, while the wheel rut was more alkaline and less saline than the other positions. Carbon content was slightly higher in the swale, while the amount of litter was no different along the tracks, but was greater in the undisturbed area. Annual plants were the main emergents from the soil seedbank. More emerged from swale soils from the tracks than from other topographic positions and from undisturbed positions. This pattern was reflected in the distribution of annual plants in the field. The addition of litter had no consistent effect on seedling numbers. Seed removal by ants was independent of topography or disturbance. Tagged perennial plant survival was low at all positions along the tracks over 28 weeks. Overall, fewer dicots died than monocots, particularly at the swale and slope. To assess for weed invasion potential a phytoassay using Carrichtera annua resulted in higher growth in swale soils and slightly higher in disturbed soils. Planted seedlings of Eucalyptus incrassata reached higher biomass in the undisturbed area in the swale and slope and showed little effect from grazing. Biological crusts were more intact in the undisturbed area and the mycorrhizal content was higher on the tracks. Clearing of vegetation along access tracks resulted in changes in patterns of transport and retention of materials (water, nutrients, litter, seeds) and this was accentuated by the topographic gradient. Consequently, functioning of the ecosystem changed as was reflected in the vegetation composition in the disturbed area, where there was much less perennial vegetation compared to the undisturbed area.
