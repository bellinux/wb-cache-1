Only the corner points of the grid are geo warped which drastically reduces the computation time. Coordinates within a grid tile are computed by a weighted bilinear interpolation of the grid corner points.As geographical projections are typically non-linear functions this introduces a certain error for the radar video display position. Keeping this error sufficiently below the radar measurement resolution makes sure that this is no restriction for the radar video display quality. The grid tile size has to be computed once for a radar position and a given projection. Thus, the grid is typically computed once for a static radar and only more often for moving radars e.g. on ships.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the stability of a link for a received packet, the period the link {{is expected to be}} valid for, i.e., the link lifetime (LLT) is calculated and compared to the expiry time of the packet in its header determined by the application. The link is considered stable for the given packet if its LLT is larger than the expiry time of the packet. The air interface of some wireless technologies supports non-line-of-sight (NLOS) operations. For instance, the air interface of WiMAX technology has adopted scalable orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) technology which supports variable bandwidth sizes between 1.25 and 20 MHz for NLOS operations [28, 29]. If the link between the communicating vehicles is a NLOS link, a two-dimensional <b>circular</b> radio <b>coverage</b> can be considered. In this case, the lower bound of the LLT is taken into account which can be easily calculated by considering the sequence of streets along which the two vehicles leave the circular ranges of each other faster.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Body Sensor Networks are an {{interesting}} emerging application of wireless sensor networks to improve healthcare and the Quality of Life. Current research has mainly focused on single-hop networks, although some works clearly show advantages of multi-hop architectures. In this paper, we model probabilistic connectivity in such multi-hop body sensor networks. Instead of using a <b>circular</b> <b>coverage</b> area, a more accurate model is defined based on the path loss along the human body. Further, we propose improvements to CICADA, a cross-layer multi-hop protocol that handles both medium access and the routing of data in BSNs. CICADA is slot-based and uses schemes to allocate these slots. Results for two reliability improvements are given: randomization of the schemes and repeating the schemes received from a parent node. We show that these improvements positively affect the throughput of the network and lead to fewer retransmissions while the energy consumption of the nodes is hardly influenced.

40|$|Passive {{underwater}} sensor {{networks are}} often used to monitor a general area of the ocean, a port or military installation, or to detect underwater vehicles near a high value unit at sea, such as a fuel ship or aircraft carrier. Deploying an underwater sensor network across a large area of interest (AOI), for military surveillance purposes, is a significant challenge due to the inherent difficulties posed by the underwater channel in terms of sensing and communications between sensors. Moreover, monetary constraints, arising from {{the high cost of}} these sensors and their deployment, limit the number of available sensors. As a result, sensor deployment must be done as efficiently as possible. The objective of this work is to develop a deployment strategy for passive underwater sensors in an area clearance scenario, where there is no apparent target for an adversary to gravitate towards, such as a ship or a port, while considering all factors pertinent to underwater sensor deployment. These factors include sensing range, communications range, monetary costs, link redundancy, range dependence, and probabilistic visitation. A complete treatment of the underwater sensor deployment problem is presented in this work from determining the purpose of the sensor field to physically deploying the sensors. Assuming a field designer is given a suboptimal number of sensors, they must be methodically allocated across an AOI. The Game Theory Field Design (GTFD) model, proposed in this work, is able to accomplish this task by evaluating the acoustic characteristics across the AOI and allocating sensors accordingly. Since GTFD considers only <b>circular</b> sensing <b>coverage</b> regions, an extension is proposed to consider irregularly shaped regions. Sensor deployment locations are planned using a proposed evolutionary approach, called the Underwater Sensor Deployment Evolutionary Algorithm, which utilizes two suitable network topologies, mesh and cluster. The effects of these topologies, and a sensor 2 ̆ 7 s communications range, on the sensing capabilities of a sensor field, are also investigated. Lastly, the impact of deployment imprecision on the connectivity of an underwater sensor field, using a mesh topology, is analyzed, for cases where sensor locations after deployment do not exactly coincide with planned sensor locations...|$|R

We propose two solutions, Greedy Advance (GA) and Greedy-Rotation-Greedy (GRG), which are {{to our knowledge}} the first sensor selfdeployment algorithms that operate in a purely localized manner and yet provide coverage guarantee. The two algorithms drive sensors to move along a locally-computed equilateral triangle tessellation (TT) to surround POI. In GA, nodes greedily proceed as close to POI as they can; in GRG, when their greedy advance is blocked, nodes rotate around POI to a TT vertex where greedy advance can resume. They both yield a connected network of TT layout with hole-free coverage; GRG furthermore assures a hexagon coverage shape centered at POI. We prove their correctness and analyze their coverage radius property. Our study shows that GRG guarantees optimal hexagonal coverage radius and near optimal <b>circular</b> <b>coverage</b> radius.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the spectral efficiency of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in both centralized and distributed configurations, {{referred to as}} C-MIMO and D-MIMO, respectively. By accounting for real environmental parameters and antenna characteristics, namely, path loss, shadowing effect, multi-path fading and antenna correlation, a novel comprehensive channel model is first proposed in closed-form, which is applicable to both types of MIMO schemes. Then, based on the proposed model, the asymptotic behavior of the spectral efficiency of the MIMO channel under both the centralized and distributed configurations is analyzed and compared in exact forms, by exploiting the theory of very long random vectors. Afterwards, a case study is performed by applying the obtained results into MIMO networks with <b>circular</b> <b>coverage.</b> In such a case, it is attested that for the D-MIMO of cell radius r_c and circular antenna array of radius r_a, the optimal value of r_a that maximizes the average spectral efficiency is accurately established by r_a^opt=r_c/ 1. 31. Monte Carlo simulation results corroborate the developed spectral-efficiency analysis. Comment: IEEE Transactions on Communications, accepted for publication, January 2016; 12 pages, 8 figure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Accurate {{representation}} of the physical layer is instrumental for a sound design and optimization of Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols for cooperative wireless networks. However, {{the vast majority of}} MAC protocols are designed and analyzed by considering simplified physical layer and channel models, which often lead to too optimistic performance predictions. In particular, even though many experimental activities have showcased the important role played by shadow-fading, most protocols are designed and evaluated by taking into account only the transmission distance (<b>circular</b> <b>coverage</b> model) or only the fast-fading. Motivated by the proved unsuitability of these models, the contribution of this paper is threefold: i) we provide important considerations on how to adequately include the effect of shadowing into the design of MAC protocols for cooperative networks; ii) we provide an analytical framework to determine the subset of active relays in order to meet a given Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirement; and iii) we study, through analysis and simulation, the performance of a promising MAC protocol for cooperative networks, which is called Persistent Relay Carrier Sensing Multiple Access (PRCSMA), by explicitly taking into account the effect of shadowing. Our study shows that shadowing can dramatically change system and protocol performance. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The energy {{expended}} by sensor nodes in {{data communication}} makes up a significant quantum {{of their total}} energy consumption. Consequently, a mathematical model that can accurately predict the communication traffic load of a sensor node is critical for designing efficient sensor network protocols. In this paper, we present an analytical model for estimating the per-node traffic load in a multi-hop wireless sensor network. We consider a typical scenario wherein, the sensor nodes periodically sense the environment and forward the collected samples to a sink using greedy geographic routing. The analysis incorporates the idealistic <b>circular</b> <b>coverage</b> radio model {{as well as a}} realistic model, log-normal shadowing. Our results confirm that irrespective of the radio model, the traffic load generally increases {{as a function of the}} node’s proximity to the sink. However, in the immediate vicinity of the sink, the two radio models yield quite contrasting results. The ideal radio model reveals the existence of a volcano region near the sink, where the traffic load drops significantly. On the contrary, with the log-normal shadowing model, the opposite effect is observed, wherein the traffic load actually increases at a much higher rate as one approaches the sink, resulting in the formation of a mountain peak. The results from our analysis are validated by extensive simulations. Index Terms—Traffic load, geographic routing protocols, sen-sor networks, multi-hop wireless networks. I...|$|E
