40|$|Soil acidity {{has become}} a {{principal}} constraint in dry land crop production systems of acidic Ultisols in tropical and subtropical regions of southern China, where winter wheat and canola are cultivated as important rotational crops. There is little information on the determination of <b>critical</b> soil <b>pH</b> as well as aluminium (Al) concentration for wheat and canola crops. The objective {{of this study is}} to determine the <b>critical</b> soil <b>pH</b> and exchangeable aluminium concentration (Al KCl) for wheat and canola production. Two pot cultures with two Ultisols from Hunan and Anhui (SE China) were conducted for wheat and canola crops in a controlled growth chamber. Aluminium sulfate (Al 2 (SO 4) 3) and hydrated lime (Ca(OH) 2) were used to obtain the target soil pH levels from 3. 7 (Hunan) and 3. 97 (Anhui) to 6. 5. Plant height, shoot dry weight, root dry weight, and chlorophyll content (SPAD value) of wheat and canola were adversely affected by soil acidity in both locations. The <b>critical</b> soil <b>pH</b> and Al KCl of the Ultisol from Hunan for wheat were 5. 29 and 0. 56  cmol kg − 1, respectively. At Anhui, the threshold soil pH and Al KCl for wheat were 4. 66 and 1. 72  cmol kg − 1, respectively. On the other hand, the <b>critical</b> soil <b>pH</b> for canola was 5. 65 and 4. 87 for the Ultisols from Hunan and Anhui, respectively. The critical soil exchangeable Al for canola cannot be determined from the experiment of this study. The results suggested that the <b>critical</b> soil <b>pH</b> and Al KCl varied between different locations for the same variety of crop, due to the different soil types and their other soil chemical properties. The <b>critical</b> soil <b>pH</b> for canola was higher than that for wheat for both Ultisols, and thus canola was more sensitive to soil acidity. Therefore, we recommend that liming should be undertaken to increase soil pH if it falls below these <b>critical</b> soil <b>pH</b> levels for wheat and canola production...|$|R

The measurement of pH was carried out using a pH electrode connected with GLP 22 Crison® pHmeter. Fluoride concentration was carried out using a selective electrode Crison®. Results. The study demonstrated that both pure citrus drinks and citrus soft drinks show pH values ranged between 3. 6 and 1. 8 and thus lower respect to <b>critical</b> <b>pHs</b> which are expected for enamel and dentine demineralization and dissolution. Regarding fluoride, measurements carried out on citrus soft drinks, generally show an absence of this ion and, only in three cases, concentrations ranged between 0. 1 and 0. 16 ppm. Conclusion. Our data showed that erosive potential of pure citrus drinks and citrus soft drinks is capable of dissolving, in vitro, considerable amounts of enamel and dentine. In vivo, erosion is probably limited from many factors as calcium concentration and saliva buffering effect.

The significance of this <b>critical</b> <b>pH</b> was at-tributed {{to the fact that}} in mixtures of acetic (or butyric) acid and its sodium salt below 6. 3 there will be "free " acid, i. e., acid which can be distilled from solution and can be converted into alcohols by C. butylicum. This concept of <b>critical</b> <b>pH</b> is applied to the dissimilation of glucose by Aerobacter indologenes in the present investigation, particularly with reference to the findings of Reynolds and Werkman (1937), that when sufficient acetic acid is present in a glucose dissimilation by A. indologenes, no gaseous hydrogen is evolved and the acetic acid disappearing in the medium is ac-counted for as 2, 3 -butylene glycol + acetylnethylcarbinol. Their conclusions were to the effect that acetic acid occurring in the fermentation was transformed into 2, 3 -butylene glycol + acetylmethylcarbinol. The principle of <b>critical</b> <b>pH</b> probably has a general application to cellular metabolism.

40|$|Dental erosion {{is often}} {{described}} solely as a surface phenomenon, unlike caries {{where it has been}} established that the destructive effects involve both the surface and the subsurface region. However, besides removal of the surface, erosion shows dissolution of mineral within the softened layer - beneath the surface. In order to distinguish this process from the carious process it is now called 'near surface demineralization'. Erosion occurs in low pH, but there is no fixed <b>critical</b> <b>pH</b> value concerning dental erosion. The <b>critical</b> <b>pH</b> value for enamel concerning caries (pH 5. 5 - 5. 7) has to be calculated from calcium and phosphate concentrations of plaque fluid. In the context of dental erosion, the <b>critical</b> <b>pH</b> value is calculated from the calcium and phosphate concentrations in the erosive solution itself. Thus, <b>critical</b> <b>pH</b> for enamel with regard to erosion will vary according to the erosive solution. Erosive tooth wear is becoming increasingly significant in the management of the long-term health of the dentition. What is considered as an acceptable amount of wear is dependent on the anticipated lifespan of the dentition and is, therefore, different for deciduous compared to permanent teeth. However, erosive damage to the teeth may compromise the patient's dentition for their entire lifetime and may require repeated and increasingly complex and expensive restorations. Therefore, it is important that diagnosis of the tooth wear process in children and adults is made early and that adequate preventive measures are undertaken. These measures can only be initiated when the risk factors are known and interactions between them are present...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between average Ellenberg's indicator values per vegetation releve and environmental values {{measured in the}} field shows a large variability. This variability might have a strong impact on critical loads determined by dynamic models (i. e. by modelling the effect of acid deposition on the vegetation composition). To derive critical loads, acidity ranges per vegetation type are determined using Ellenberg indicator values, and subsequently translated into soil pH values. Acidity ranges are here defined as the range in which 80 % of the characteristic species of a vegetation type can potentially occur. In this paper we explore the uncertainty in the modelled pH ranges and discuss the possible implications for critical loads. The effect of an overall translation instead of transfer functions per class on the estimated <b>critical</b> soil <b>pH,</b> and therefore on the critical loads, was calculated {{for a set of}} vegetation types in The Netherlands. The use of these different transfer functions resulted in <b>critical</b> soil <b>pH</b> values that differed by 0. 2 pH units on average. For 12 out of the 17 -investigated vegetation types this effect is of the same magnitude as the modelled effect of a 50 % reduction in acidifying deposition. We also calculated the intrinsic uncertainty in the critical load estimates (i. e. due to the uncertainty in the regression parameters), {{which turned out to be}} even larger than the uncertainty due to the use of different transfer functions. This type of uncertainty was smaller when transfer functions per vegetation class were used (95 % confidence interval c 1. 4 vs c 1. 7 pH units). Although the modelled critical loads have a large amount of uncertainty, they are not much different from experimentally derived critical loads. We conclude that modelled critical loads can be used when no empirical data are present, although they have to be,regarded as less certain. The uncertainty can be reduced by incorporating transfer functions per vegetation class...|$|R

40|$|With rising demands, {{oil and gas}} {{exploration}} of high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) wells are increasing worldwide. Due to aggressiveness of HPHT environments, piping and equipments are constructed with high-strength corrosion resistant alloys (CRAs). Duplex stainless steel is one of the candidate alloys that offer high strength along with corrosion resistance. It possesses the advantages of both austenitic and ferritic stainless steels and hence, the name duplex or dual phase stainless steel. In order to control corrosion, cathodic protection is commonly being employed on the structures and equipment. Cathodic protection is accomplished by applying a direct current to the structure which causes the structure potential to change from the natural corrosion potential (Ecorr). The required cathodic protection current is supplied by sacrificial anode materials or by an impressed current system. Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) is an associated phenomenon, which results in the production of hydrogen ions, leading to its absorption in the protected metal and subsequent hydrogen embrittlement of metals and welds. To prevent this embrittlement, cathodic protection is closely studied in terms of finding the critical potential, pH, temperature etc. that does not cause hydrogen embrittlement. This paper describes the study carried out to find the role of pH on the absorption of hydrogen in Duplex Stainless steel. It has been observed that at a <b>critical</b> <b>pH,</b> hydrogen intake in the sample is very high, as compared to the pH below and above the <b>critical</b> <b>pH.</b> <b>Critical</b> <b>pH</b> observed for duplex stainless steel is a trade of between hydrogen evolution and absorption for given duplex structure...|$|E

It is becoming increasingly evident that coordination between primary H+ pumps, most notably the V-ATPase, and secondary ion/H+ exchangers allows this endomembrane pH maintenance to occur. This article describes some of the recent insights from the studies of plant cation/H+ exchangers and anion/H+ exchangers that demonstrate the fundamental roles of these transporters in pH homeostasis within intracellular compartments...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} found that {{bacteriorhodopsin}} containing 13 -cis-retinal as the chromophore (13 -cis-bR) is competent in a one-photon photocycle which involves an M-type intermediate. Such an effect can be shown in 13 -cis-Br obtained by means of 13 -cis-retinal treatment of white bacterioopsin membrane sheets, as well as in dark-adapted purple sheets, solubilized Br and Br proteoliposomes. The 13 -cis-Br photocycle with the M intermediate is found to be proton-motive, the electrogenic phases resembling those of the all-trans-Br photocycle. All of these effects are observed only when the Ph is above some <b>critical</b> value, namely <b>Ph</b> 8. 5 – 9. 5 for the Br sheets, 7. 6 for proteoliposomes and 7. 0 for the solubilized Br...|$|R
