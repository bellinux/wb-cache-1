50|$|Centrex is a PBX-like service {{providing}} switching {{at the central}} office instead of at the customer's premises. Typically, the telephone company owns and manages all the communications equipment and software necessary to implement the <b>Centrex</b> <b>service</b> and then sells various services to the customer.|$|E
5000|$|The Centrex {{customer}} is {{not restricted to}} using the features available to POTS customers, but can choose {{from a wide variety}} of special services and features. In fact, telecommunications companies generally offer numerous types of <b>Centrex</b> <b>service,</b> including [...] "Packaged Centrex", [...] "Centrex Data", and [...] "Customized Centrex".|$|E
50|$|Last-call return, {{automatic}} recall, or (on PBX and <b>centrex</b> <b>service)</b> camp-on, is a telecommunication feature {{offered by}} telephony service providers to subscribers {{to provide the}} subscriber with the telephone number, and sometimes the time, of the last caller. The service may also offer the facility to place {{a call to the}} calling party.|$|E

50|$|Many calling {{features}} {{became available}} to telephone subscribers after computerization of telephone exchanges during the 1980s. The services include voicemail, Caller ID, call waiting, speed dialing, conference calls (three-way calling), enhanced 911, and <b>Centrex</b> <b>services.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Centrex</b> Data <b>services</b> {{can provide}} {{relatively}} low speed (56 and 64 kbit/s) data services utilizing the circuit-switched telephone network. Although {{they are now}} overshadowed by the internet and other data networks, <b>Centrex</b> Data <b>services</b> can offer very flexible and wide-reaching network configurations since connections can be made almost anywhere within {{the reach of the}} telephone network.|$|R
5000|$|Customized Centrex is {{the most}} {{flexible}} (and most expensive) <b>Centrex</b> <b>service</b> as it offers a highly customizable set of options that require specialized programming and troubleshooting skills to maintain. A typical Customized Centrex setup will allow 4-digit dialing between [...] "locals" [...] (perhaps {{even if they are}} located {{in different parts of the}} city), customized routing through the telephone network (such as Least Cost Routing or Time of Day Routing), and customized codes for invoking features.|$|E
50|$|Class 5 end-office {{switches}} provide {{local telephone}} service and dialtone to residential, business, and government subscribers, {{as well as}} telephone company payphones. Residential service includes message rate and flat rate local calling plans with extra charges for long distance calls and supplementary services such as call waiting, 3-way calling, and call forwarding. Business service is mostly message rate local calling plans with extra charges for long distance and supplementary services. Message Rate calling means that subscribers pay for calls based on duration of the call and distance to the called party. Government subscribers include cities, counties, state, and federal agencies and often included <b>Centrex</b> <b>service.</b> Pay phones were traditionally provided exclusively by telephone companies but during the early 1980s Customer-owned coin-operated telephone services were established.|$|E
50|$|The other trend {{involved}} {{the idea of}} focusing on core competence. PBX services had always been hard to arrange for smaller companies, and many companies realized that handling their own telephony was not their core competence. These considerations {{gave rise to the}} concept of the hosted PBX. In wireline telephony, the original hosted PBX was the <b>Centrex</b> <b>service</b> provided by telcos since the 1960s; later competitive offerings evolved into the modern competitive local exchange carrier. In voice over IP, hosted solutions are easier to implement as the PBX may be located at and managed by any telephone service provider, connecting to the individual extensions via the Internet. The upstream provider no longer needs to run direct, local leased lines to the served premises.|$|E
50|$|TELES {{supplies}} {{service providers}} with complete Class 4 and Class 5 NGN Softswitch solutions. TELES NGN Solution {{is a standard}} based, scalable architecture aimed at minimizing integration time and allowing quick deployment. The solution includes hosted voice functionality which enables residential VoIP services, hosted PBX (IP <b>Centrex)</b> <b>services,</b> Fixed-Mobile-Convergence, IP Trunking, and additional value added applications. Classical NGN/PSTN applications like Wholesale, Long Distance, and NGN backbone services are also available with this solution.|$|R
50|$|Cox Business is {{an early}} adopter of Voice over IP {{technology}} and, in 2007, Cox became the first cable provider in North America to deploy a fully owned and managed IP telephony service for businesses, Cox Business VoiceManager. Cox Business is expected to launch Managed IP PBX, SIP Trunking and IP <b>Centrex</b> <b>services</b> in 2011, allowing customers to more efficiently route voice traffic over Internet Protocol. Cox Business currently supports more than 800,000 business phone lines.|$|R
40|$|Address of Record (AOR) This {{document}} {{describes the}} requirements {{and implementation of}} a group telephony feature commonly known as Bridged Line Appearance (BLA) or Multiple Line Appearance (MLA), or Shared Call/Line Appearance (SCA). When implemented using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), it {{is referred to as}} shared appearances of an Address of Record (AOR) since SIP does not have the concept of lines. This feature is commonly offered in IP <b>Centrex</b> <b>services</b> and IP Private Branch Exchange (IPBX) offerings and is likely to be implemented on SIP IP telephones and SIP feature servers used in a business environment. This feature allows several user agents (UAs) to share a common AOR, learn about calls placed and received by other UAs in the group, and pick up or join calls within the group. This document discusses use cases, lists requirements, and defines extensions to implement this feature. This specification updates RFCs 3261 an...|$|R
50|$|By 1995, the NANPA {{was forced}} to change the format rules to {{increase}} the number of valid area codes. Previously, all area codes had 0 or 1 as their second (middle) digit; the rule change allowed any digit except 9 as the second digit. This broke 1 + 7 digit long-distance calling within the same area code and required the leading 1- be dialed on toll calls in cities where it had formerly been optional. The change also caused problems for some office private branch exchange systems, creating an opportunity readily exploited by vendors to sell businesses costly new equipment or hosted <b>Centrex</b> <b>service.</b> Widescale introduction of new area codes created confusion as consumers were often unaware which were domestic-rate calls and which were premium calls to Caribbean or foreign numbers within the NANP.|$|E
40|$|This project {{assesses the}} {{feasibility}} of Intranet IP telephony as a competitive choice for business voice networks. A cost model is developed to determine the net present cost of a business voice network from different type of voice vendors. The study assesses four options: a traditional Private Branch Exchange (PBX), a <b>Centrex</b> <b>service,</b> an IP based PBX and a traditional PBX with a server, which provides multimedia applications using Internet protocol. The userâ€™s objective is to select the alternative that minimizes total net present costs. The sensitivity analysis is applied to each option and a decision tree is constructed for all systems. IP based PBX {{is estimated to be}} the least net present value solution...|$|E
