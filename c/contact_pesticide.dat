30|$|Unfortunately, {{white grub}} pests are {{difficult}} to control because of their hidden nature, sometimes combined with insufficient knowledge on their life cycles and below-ground ecology. It is difficult to effectively use synthetic insecticides against soil pests due to problems of leaching, adsorption or rapid break down, and the impracticality of applying <b>contact</b> <b>pesticides</b> (Mayo and Peters, 1978; Furlan et al., 2006). Soil pesticides are highly concentrated formulations and can endanger the handling farmer. They are often also highly toxic, with many being restricted or indeed banned (WHO, 2009). As for Rwanda, the availability of soil pesticides is limited. They are often too expensive or impractical for small-holder growers (Toepfer et al., 2014). Socioeconomic constraints have kept pesticide use in Africa the lowest among all the world regions (Musebe et al., 2017), a fact also valid for Rwanda. These factors combined present a barrier to the effective control of soil pests in Rwanda.|$|R

Três municípios foram aleatoriamente escolhidos. A amostra selecionada por conveniência foi recrutada durante três meses (2005) e se compôs de 298 sujeitos de ambos os sexos, com idade entre 18 e 65 anos e que procuravam farmácia pública ou privada para a compra de medicamentos. Os dados obtidos, mediante entrevistas estruturadas, demonstraram que 68, 4 % dos entrevistados exerciam atividade rural, dos quais 74, 8 % eram membros de famílias de agricultores e tinham contato com agrotóxicos. A média de idade foi 51 ± 16, 5 anos para os entrevistados com contato com agrotóxicos e 50 ± 17, 9 anos para os sem contato. A amostra foi constituída de 36, 2 % por homens e 57, 7 % dos indivíduos que apresentavam mais de quatro anos de estudo. O contato direto ou indireto com agrotóxicos associou-se ao relato de várias doenças, sendo as neurológicas e as orais as mais prevalentes. Houve associação com relato de condições dolorosas, de modo que indivíduos com contato com agrotóxicos apresentaram em torno de duas vezes mais chances de as referirem.

40|$|Phosphine is {{the primary}} {{fumigant}} used to protect {{the majority of the}} world' s grain {{and a variety of other}} stored commodities from insect pests. Phosphine is playing an increasingly important role in the protection of commodities for two primary reasons. Firstly, use of the alternative fumigant, methyl bromide, has been sharply curtailed and is tightly regulated due to its role in ozone depletion, and secondly, consumers are becoming increasingly intolerant of <b>contact</b> <b>pesticides.</b> Niche alternatives to phosphine exist, but they suffer from a range of factors that limit their use, including: 1) Limited commercial adoption due to expense or slow mode of action; 2) Poor efficacy due to low toxicity, rapid sorption, limited volatility or high density; 3) Public health concerns due to toxicity to handlers or nearby residents, as well as risk of explosion; 4) Poor consumer acceptance due to toxic residues or smell. These same factors limit the prospects of quickly identifying and deploying a new fumigant. Given that resistance toward phosphine is increasing among insect pests, improved monitoring and management of resistance is a priority. Knowledge of the mode of action of phosphine as well as the mechanisms of resistance may also greatly reduce the effort and expense of identifying synergists or novel replacement compounds...|$|R
40|$|Phosphine is {{the only}} {{economically}} viable fumigant for routine control of insect pests of stored food products, but its continued use is now threatened by the world-wide emergence of high-level resistance in key pest species. Phosphine has a unique mode of action relative to well-characterised <b>contact</b> <b>pesticides.</b> Similarly, the selective pressures that lead to resistance against field sprays differ dramatically from those encountered during fumigation. The consequences of these differences have not been investigated adequately. We determine the genetic basis of phosphine resistance in Rhyzopertha dominica strains collected from New South Wales and South Australia and compare this with resistance in a previously characterised strain from Queensland. The resistance levels range from 225 and 100 times the baseline response of a sensitive reference strain. Moreover, molecular and phenotypic data indicate that high-level resistance was derived independently {{in each of the}} three widely separated geographical regions. Despite the independent origins, resistance was due to two interacting genes in each instance. Furthermore, complementation analysis reveals that all three strains contain an incompletely recessive resistance allele of the autosomal rph 1 resistance gene. This is particularly noteworthy as a resistance allele at rph 1 was previously proposed to be a necessary first step in the evolution of high-level resistance. Despite the capacity of phosphine to disrupt a wide range of enzymes and biological processes, it is remarkable that th...|$|R
