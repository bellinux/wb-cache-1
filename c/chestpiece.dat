25|$|Acoustic stethoscopes are {{familiar}} to most people, and operate on the transmission of sound from the chest piece, via air-filled hollow tubes, to the listener's ears. The <b>chestpiece</b> usually consists of two sides that can be placed against the patient for sensing sound; a diaphragm (plastic disc) or bell (hollow cup). If the diaphragm {{is placed on the}} patient, body sounds vibrate the diaphragm, creating acoustic pressure waves which travel up the tubing to the listener's ears.

2500|$|The {{stethoscope}} [...] is {{an acoustic}} medical device for auscultation, {{or listening to}} the internal sounds of an animal or human body. It typically has a small disc-shaped resonator that is placed against the chest, and two tubes connected to earpieces. It {{is often used to}} listen to lung and heart sounds. It is also used to listen to intestines and blood flow in arteries and veins. In combination with a sphygmomanometer, it is commonly used for measurements of blood pressure. Less commonly, [...] "mechanic's stethoscopes", equipped with rod shaped <b>chestpieces,</b> are used to listen to internal sounds made by machines (for example, sounds and vibrations emitted by worn ball bearings), such as diagnosing a malfunctioning automobile engine by listening to the sounds of its internal parts.

2500|$|Her outfit in Bayonetta 2 {{was again}} {{designed}} by Shimazaki. It was generally designed more around straight lines than curves.

There was debate {{about where to}} show skin, {{but when it was}} decided to create a cape {{at the front of the}} outfit, the front of her outfit was closed and instead they opted to show a large area of her back. For her new look, blue became a key color as opposed to the first game, where it was red: this was because water was a key theme for the second game and Hashimoto requested blue to become the design's key color. This eventually proved difficult as, combined with the black and silver incorporated into her outfit and the game's general color palette, it did not have the sharp qualities of her former appearance. Shimazaki described trying to make her stand out in her black outfit as [...] "a nightmare". Her overall design theme was [...] "solid". The character's hairstyle underwent a major redesign. Hashimoto's main reason behind this was that [...] " [...] personality is the type that would not want to remain stagnant. She would want to change her style, taste in fashion, and her costumes.

Her new guns, Love is Blue, were also difficult to design, as making them too large or too similar in color to other elements of Bayonetta's outfit would not have fitted her. In the end, they were made a more striking shade of blue, as well as being given some gold to match Bayonetta's <b>chestpiece</b> and a silver sheen.

50|$|Playmobil {{hands were}} {{designed}} {{to be capable of}} gripping and holding objects. Earlier figures had arms of one piece. Since 1982 all figures have hands that rotate at the wrists. Almost all Playmobil figures are unnamed, thus allowing children to invent their own characters. The exceptions to this are characters from the 1999 game Hype: The Time Quest, where some figures were subsequently made, including the title character, Hype. The first figures used a chiseled out hairpiece with a button shape for adding headgear, until a later redesign gave the hairpiece a more natural rounded shape, also prompting a redesign of the headgear. The first female figures were distinguished by hairstyle and a wider <b>chestpiece</b> suggesting a skirt, until a redesign replaced the <b>chestpiece</b> with more displayed breasts and slightly thinner arms.|$|E

30|$|Introduction The {{pulmonary}} auscultation {{is used by}} respiratory therapist (RT) {{to evaluate}} the efficiency of a treatment. Listen to the noises coming from the primary bronchi (PB) {{is important because it}} is the place where secretions can be accumulated. Therefore, it is crucial to know exactly where to place the stethoscope’s <b>chestpiece</b> on the chest. Few studies have analyzed the chest area where the PB were located. Our hypothesis is that PB are localized on a line that joins axillary fossa (Bi-Axillary line: BAL). The aim of our study is to evaluate the probability to find the primary bronchi by analysis of chest radiography.|$|E
40|$|The {{stethoscope}} is {{an acoustic}} medical device for auscultation where human ear plays significant part. Long before doctors practiced immediate auscultation meaning placing ear directly on patient’s body by Salinsky (1990), then monaural introduced by Laennec; later binaural, Comins’s invention and Cammann developed further. Several decades numerous innovations made predominantly over <b>chestpiece</b> some had drawbacks. Dr Littman introduced teaching stethoscope with two headset and researcher utilized as prior art. Experimental research method {{used and the}} study aimed to determine accuracy and measurement of speed of the device in terms of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and acceptability of user. The subjects were 19 clients and 27 nursing students, government /private registered nurses. The device are comparable to single binaural stethoscope in accuracy performance; speed of sound, former is slightly higher than the latter but still considered as normal; the device are acceptable to users; the utility model have {{no significant difference in}} accuracy performance and speed measurements of systolic and diastolic. The utility model may be tried in any acoustic activities and may be pilot tested to the Universities animal science courses, veterinary medicine other Colleges of Nursing and all health allied courses...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. October 2015. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisors: Rajesh Rajamani, Arthur Erdman. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 133 pages. The low signal-to-noise ratio encountered during auscultation in many high noise environments can impede a physician’s successful examination and {{diagnosis of a}} patient’s health. This thesis develops a vibro-acoustic model for an electronic stethoscope and investigates a number of techniques to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The techniques explored are: 1. 	Redesign of stethoscope components for improved vibration isolation 2. 	Use of dual piezoelectric transducers and dynamic model inversion for elimination of physician handling noise 3. 	Implementation of active noise cancellation using either a reference microphone or a reference accelerometer In a digital stethoscope, a piezoelectric transducer is used to convert chest sounds into electrical signals. Due to the larger <b>chestpiece</b> size needed to accommodate the electronics of a digital stethoscope, noise due to physician handling of the device is often greater. To characterize {{the effects of the}} device’s construction on its sensitivity to handling disturbances, a theoretical stethoscope model is developed. The vibro-acoustic model relates force inputs acting on the body of the stethoscope to voltage signals created by its piezo-ceramic transducer. Using the theoretical model, simulations are conducted to demonstrate that traditional vibration isolation applied between the <b>chestpiece</b> and the transducer results in poor coupling—loss in sensitivity—between the transducer and the patient’s chest. By using a floating transducer housing, equally effective vibration isolation can be accomplished with far less loss in sensitivity to patient signals. The proposed isolation design was experimentally evaluated by redesigning the stethoscope’s components. However, limitations in the damping and stiffness values of available isolation materials resulted in some loss of sensitivity over a narrow frequency range. Next, as a superior alternative to physically isolating the stethoscope transducer from external disturbances a signal processing based approach to compensate for handling noise is developed. It is possible to use a redundant sensor and novel input estimation techniques to digitally remove the undesired noise measurement components. By adding a second piezo to the stethoscope assembly, it is shown that an inverse dynamic mapping can be used to relate the measured signals to original directional inputs acting on the stethoscope. An output feedback observer is developed to account for the unknown initial state of the system dynamics. In simulation, it is shown that the effects of the unknown and undesired disturbance input can be removed over the entire frequency range critical for auscultation. In physical experiments, the feasibility of the dual-piezo stethoscope approach to estimate and remove these disturbances is also demonstrated. In many patient transport environments, the ambient noise can routinely exceed 75 dB with the most severe environments having noise sources more than 3000 times louder than a typical auscultation signal. For noise from the patient side of the stethoscope, passive isolation methods cannot be used as they will impede transmission of the desired chest sounds to the transducer. Based on helicopter field data acquired with an electronic stethoscope retrofitted with an array of microphones and accelerometers, it is demonstrated that primary noise corruption during auscultation in a helicopter can be attributed to vehicle vibrations. Using this information, it is shown that a reference accelerometer can be used in place of a conventional reference microphone to estimate the noise corruption. Using either the LMS or NLMS active noise cancellation algorithms, it is possible to extract the desired auscultation signal. This is confirmed experimentally by simulating the internal cabin noise levels of the harshest noise environment in which injured military personnel are routinely examined—a mobile Black Hawk helicopter...|$|E

Their employees, particularly those exposed to second-hand smoke, {{are at increased risk}} for developing chronic respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and lung cancer. Objectives In this work, we aimed at evaluating relationships between occupational ETS exposure, biological damage (DNA or proteome alterations) and putative respiratory dysfunctions. Materials and Methods A group of restaurants located in Lisbon has been studied, in which fine particles (smaller than 2. 5 µm; PM 2. 5), indicative of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) contamination, were measured. After informed consent, workers were evaluated for acute exposure to ETS based on cotinine levels in urine and clinically evaluated for their respiratory health by spirometry measurements and <b>chestpiece</b> auscultation. Effects of ETS exposure on genotoxic lesions were evaluated by measuring DNA/chromosomes breaks in peripheral blood lymphocytes and buccal mucosa cells. Effects of ETS exposure on plasma proteins is being studied using a 2 D-DIGE-MALDI-TOF/TOF approach. To achieve that goal, global proteome characterization is being carried based on the same individual plasma samples collected for genotoxic studies and were pooled according to previous criteria. Results Results have confirmed higher respirable particle levels in smoking-designated areas of those entertainment places, indicating an ETS contamination. Leukocytes from ETS-exposed-workers presented lower levels of genotoxic-induced damage in comparison with non-exposed workers, suggesting an ETS-induced stress adaption response in exposed-workers. By proteomics, we are now to investigating those workers for putative alterations on their plasma proteome to provide additional insights on the adaptative response mechanisms that might be activated by ETS exposition. Conclusion Altogether, this study provides information on indoor air quality of Lisbon smoking entertainment places, in particular ETS contamination, and may provide biomarker candidates for occupational ETS-exposure which might precede respiratory diseases on their employees.

40|$|Abstract Background Acute {{respiratory}} {{infections are}} {{the leading cause of}} childhood mortality. The lack of physicians in rural areas of developing countries makes difficult their correct diagnosis and treatment. The staff of rural health facilities (health-care technicians) may not be qualified to distinguish respiratory diseases by auscultation. For this reason, the goal of this project is the development of a tele-stethoscopy system that allows a physician to receive real-time cardio-respiratory sounds from a remote auscultation, as well as video images showing where the technician is placing the stethoscope on the patient’s body. Methods A real-time wireless stethoscopy system was designed. The initial requirements were: 1) The system must send audio and video synchronously over IP networks, not requiring an Internet connection; 2) It must preserve the quality of cardiorespiratory sounds, allowing to adapt the binaural pieces and the <b>chestpiece</b> of standard stethoscopes, and; 3) Cardiorespiratory sounds should be recordable at both sides of the communication. In order to verify the diagnostic capacity of the system, a clinical validation with eight specialists has been designed. In a preliminary test, twelve patients have been auscultated by all the physicians using the tele-stethoscopy system, versus a local auscultation using traditional stethoscope. The system must allow listen the cardiac (systolic and diastolic murmurs, gallop sound, arrhythmias) and respiratory (rhonchi, rales and crepitations, wheeze, diminished and bronchial breath sounds, pleural friction rub) sounds. Results The design, development and initial validation of the real-time wireless tele-stethoscopy system are described in detail. The system was conceived from scratch as open-source, low-cost and designed {{in such a way that}} many universities and small local companies in developing countries may manufacture it. Only free open-source software has been used in order to minimize manufacturing costs and look for alliances to support its improvement and adaptation. The microcontroller firmware code, the computer software code and the PCB schematics are available for free download in a subversion repository hosted in SourceForge. Conclusions It has been shown that real-time tele-stethoscopy, together with a videoconference system that allows a remote specialist to oversee the auscultation, may be a very helpful tool in rural areas of developing countries. </p...|$|E
