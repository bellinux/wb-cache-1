40|$|Animation film, 4 minutes 21 seconds, colour, sound, digital movie HD 1920 x 1080 pixels. This {{short film}} is an {{experimental}} abstract animation, using ‘hand-made’ direct-on-film painting and collaging techniques on 35 mm film and film leader, {{which are then}} scanned digitally and combined with computer imaging through manipulating the film images further. The animated imagery explores the theme of visual abstraction in animation while making allusion to the iconic image of a square (the ‘black square’ and ‘white square’ by the painter Malevich). The square is reinvented in the animation, reiterated in an abstract environment, transformed through colour, texture and imbued with movement as the animated frames repeat in sequence across the screen. The soundtrack is the recording titled ‘Jazz Trio in Rue Mouffetard’, an original audio recording on location, by Des Coulam, a Paris based sound recordist and sound designer. Random sounds, fragments of conversations and lively jazz music merge in an auditory abstraction of the environment, which the animated images are edited to. The animation ‘Abstract Iterations II’ premiered at the ‘London International Animation Festival’ on 5 th December 2015, 5 pm at the Barbican Cinema 2 venue. The animation ‘Abstract Iterations II’ is created in the format of HD 1920 x 1080 pixels (16 : 9) <b>cinema</b> <b>screen</b> <b>format</b> to play as a one-screen animation with audio. It is a completely new and original work based on a previous work titled ‘Abstract Iterations’, which was a silent animation in a different format and sequencing that played across three screens simultaneously in a three-channel format as a site-specific work (see previous output, which screened at ‘Animation Goes MSU!’ Museum of Contemporary Art, 26 May – 14 June 2015, part of The World Festival of Animated Film – Animafest Zagreb. ...|$|E

5000|$|Vertical filmmaking has {{aesthetic}} roots reaching back {{at least}} to tall frescoes and stained-glass windows of Christian churches. Noting that the new cinematic art had taken on the old strictures of the theatrical proscenium, on 17 September 1930 Russian filmmaker and theorist Sergei Eisenstein addressed the Technicians Branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Hollywood, calling for a <b>cinema</b> <b>screen</b> of variable aspect ratio (a [...] "dynamic square"), one which would be able to cope with whatever compositional format the filmmaker chose, including a vertical framing. [...] He lost the argument to a <b>screen</b> <b>format</b> standardised at a new Academy ratio (1.375:1) and vertical filmmaking has largely remained confined to experimental artists of the Expanded Cinema movement, which flourished during the 1960s and 70s. If digital video production {{at the turn of the}} millennium freed the medium from many apparatus-based constraints it wasn't until the advent of portable screen devices such as the iPhone that the door opened to vertical video production and spectatorship for mass audiences.|$|R
