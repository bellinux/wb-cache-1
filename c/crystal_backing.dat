50|$|At the party, Caroline asks Bonnie for the crystal, but Bonnie {{does not}} give it back. Caroline tries to take it,but it shocks her the moment she touches it. The two of them argue and Bonnie leaves. When later Damon asks Caroline if she got his <b>crystal</b> <b>back</b> and she tells him no, he tells her that she is useless and shallow and leaves the bar.

40|$|We {{have found}} that the {{application}} of light to strontium barium niobate (SBN) during electrical repoling stabilises the newly formed domains. This stabilisation becomes apparent when repoling the <b>crystal</b> <b>back</b> into its original domain direction as a change in the distribution of displacement current as a function of voltage. This appears to be the process underlying the other recent work in the area of optical control of domain structures for quasi phase-matching of nonlinear processes.

5000|$|Cornwood collapses in on itself, hurling the {{characters}} {{back into the}} real world. With the <b>crystal</b> <b>back</b> in the Professor's stomach, Mom once again orders Walt and Larry to retrieve it. Before his moment of discomfort, the Professor requests a hug from Igner. Mom complies, saying someone should hug him as she never has. As the Professor had theorized, Igner had swallowed Mom's crystal in defiance and the hug brings the crystals in the two men's stomachs close enough to render all dark matter useless, breaking Mom's stranglehold on the fuel supply. As a temporary propulsion source, the crew harnesses dozens of Nibblonians to pull their ship home, which they call [...] "Nibbler Power".|$|R
5000|$|While Plummer conducts his investigation, McCadden {{translates}} the hieroglyphic {{text from}} the sarcophagus. He hopes it will reveal {{the identity of}} the mummy. The text reveals that Tutankhamun found the alien in a coma-like state. Thinking that the unconscious alien was a god, Tutankhamun and his attendants touched it and were killed by its infectious fungus. The king and the alien were then buried together in the king's tomb. McCadden, having figured out that the [...] "mummy" [...] is an alien, makes the connection between the alien and the crystals. He then traces the stolen <b>crystals</b> <b>back</b> to Sharpe, who admits to the theft and gives McCadden the one crystal he kept for himself.|$|R

50|$|When Pietro and Crystal {{failed to}} quickly return, Fydor assured Bova {{that they were}} merely delayed by a storm {{and that they could}} take care of themselves. Some time later Fydor fed Bova some broth while chatting with her. Meanwhile, Quicksilver told the High Evolutionary of Bova's illness. The Evolutionary and the Animutants {{accompanied}} Pietro and <b>Crystal</b> <b>back</b> to Bova's cottage, where he quickly determined that her illness was not organic, but that she had been poisoned. An image of Exodus then appeared, revealing his responsibility and motivation before directing Rakkus to transform Fydor into a monster. Rakkus/Fydor then released an explosion that leveled Bova's cottage and the surrounding landscape, killing a couple of Animutants too near to the house. Luckily a force bubble shielded the High Evolutionary, Crystal, Quicksilver, and Bova from the explosion.|$|R
