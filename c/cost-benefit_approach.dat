40|$|It is {{unlikely}} that <b>cost–benefit</b> <b>approaches</b> will be effective in identifying investments that support gender equality without a relevant “social framing”. Criteria for a “social framing” are lacking, yet <b>cost–benefit</b> <b>approaches</b> often guide investment decisions for disaster risk and environmental management. Mainstream approaches typically do a poor job identifying and characterizing costs and benefits, and often fail to address distributive concerns (i. e., how costs and benefits may be distributed throughout society, to whom, etc.). Gender-blind investments may project responsibility for equality “problems” onto one sex, potentially augmenting gender inequalities and disaster risk. This article examines evidence from the gender, disaster, and development literature to identify distributive concerns and criteria for an equitable “social framing” for economic evaluations. Primary distributive concerns identified regard assumptions of women’s homogeneity, agency, “active” participation, {{and the influence of}} customary practice and displacement on disaster vulnerability. The need for a “gender-responsive” “social framing” that considers the needs {{of men and women in}} relation to one another is evident. Second, cost–benefit studies focused on gender equality concerns are reviewed and the “social framing” is critiqued. Results show most studies are not “gender-responsive”. Women’s health concerns, often exacerbated by disasters, are sidelined by assumptions regarding distributive concerns and reductive outcome measures...|$|R

50|$|A further {{development}} of NATA has been its use of an approach that disaggregates impacts between all those who are affected by a proposal, rather than the traditional <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>approach</b> of simply assessing the net impacts on society.

50|$|In 1976 Riley first {{published}} {{a definition of}} IA {{as a way of}} analysing IR based on a cost-benefit model. Since Riley, scholars have outlined further developed methodologies. Henderson took a <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>approach</b> hoping to draw focus from manpower-costing to information storage and acquisition which he felt was being overlooked. In 1985 Gillman focused upon identifying the relationships which existed between various components in order to map them to one another. Neither Henderson nor Gillman’s methods offered alternative approaches beyond the existing organisational frameworks. Quinn took a hybrid-approach combining Gillman and Henderson’s methods to identify the purpose of existing IR and to position them within the organisation, as did Worlock. The differentiator between Quinn and Worlock lay in Worlock’s consideration of solutions outside of the current organisational structure. These approaches had thus far had paid little attention {{to the needs of the}} user or in making structured recommendations for the development of a corporate information strategy. Therefore, here follows a brief outline and overall comparison of four published strategic approaches in order that one might understand the development of the IA methodology.|$|E
40|$|Supporting value judgements about {{policies}} and programmes {{is a central}} task in evaluation. There is, however, little consensus on how evaluators are to accomplish this task. The traditional <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>approaches</b> were found wanting and yet valuation as promoted by checklists or qualitative stakeholder interviews is not anchored to an economic theory and thus inspires little confidence. While no single methodology {{is likely to be}} accepted by all, recent developments in economic theory support a new interpretation. This proposed approach is a variant of social cost benefit analysis (SCBA); it retains the representation of stakeholder values while avoiding the more dogmatic, and even mechanical, underpinnings of traditional economic analysis. In this article we trace the development of this new ‘options-based’ approach and chart out the path for further research. It warrants, we believe, a voice in the dialogue on economic evaluation.

Water resource reliability in the Pacific Northwest is becoming less dependable, but population and municipal water demand is increasing. The Gales Creek Watershed and its tributary Clear Creek encompass 48, 481 acres in the Tualatin River Basin. The city of Forest Grove owns Clear Creek and uses stream for municipal water. In addition to Clear Creek’s municipal importance, the watershed is also used for native steelhead trout spawning. This capstone has been prepared to research how and if municipal water intake impact steelhead trout summer habitat. It includes watershed history, agency roles, fish survey history, <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>approaches,</b> and recommendations for sustaining steelhead trout habitat while maintaining municipal water supply. The results find that the city can reduce their summer intake of Clear Creek water and still meet municipal water needs.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the growing concern over Greenhouse Gas {{emissions}} and the resulting human induced climate change. The background to a <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>approach</b> is sketched {{in terms of the}} scientific understanding and expected impacts. Then the theory behind a <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>approach</b> is explained and some of the studies and their results are critically presented. In the final section the concern for future generations is raised and a <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>approach</b> is shown to violate a right of the innocent to be free from harm.

40|$|Abstract. A risk related Value of Spend for Saving a Statistical Life (VSSSL) is {{proposed}} for cost-benefit studies across the power generation sector, {{and the nuclear}} industry in particular. An upper bound on VSSSL is set based on the UK government standard of around £ 1 M or, in particular circumstances, £ 2 M and the observation that excessive spend (probably {{of the order of}} more than £ 5 M per statistical life) will cost lives. Above a risk of 10 - 3 a- 1 it is assumed that VSSSL approaches a value around £ 2 M (broad range £ 1 M to £ 5 M). At risks around 10 - 6 a- 1 it {{is proposed}} that an appropriate VSSSL lies at £ 0. 5 M (range £ 0. 25 M to £ 1 M). Where risks to the individual fall to the order of 10 - 9 a- 1, or less, a low residual VSSSL of £ 0. 01 M is applied. A practical example is explored with respect to radiological protection where a total collective dose determination is disaggregated to resolve broad bands of individual exposure, and hence risk. Where collective doses are dominated by individual doses {{no more than a few}} µSv, the detriment arising from a manSv can be valued at about £ 15 k to £ 60 k, which can have a major effect on <b>cost-benefit</b> <b>approaches</b> to spend decisions. 1...|$|R
