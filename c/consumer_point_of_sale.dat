40|$|The beef burger is {{a common}} food on both the kitchen and {{restaurant}} table since the 1800 s {{and is one of}} the most common choices on fast food menus. The main reason for this is because it is tasty, easily accessible, customisable, affordable and portable. In ROI, composite foods (i. e. foods made up of more than one ingredient) are an important source of meat, especially burgers, with the majority of burgers either being fried or grilled, and many eaten from takeaway outlets.

In this review, we describe research progress to date, especially with regard to commercial fish, and discuss genomic findings in model fish in order to better address the genetic basis of the traits.

And most of the fees are ad valorem—that is, based on transaction value—rather than fixed fees per transaction. Merchants are critical of the ad valorem debit card fees. They argue that debit cards, unlike credit cards, do not extend credit to card users, and the risks of debit fraud are small. So, there should be no cost rationale for debit cards to charge ad valorem fees. In fact, fixed pertransaction fees are the norm for debit cards in many countries around the world. This controversy raises interesting questions. Given that debit cards incur a fixed cost per transaction, why do they charge ad valorem fees?

40|$|Involvement is an {{important}} psychological construct for understanding consumers’ underlying purchase decision process and those factors that shape product perceptions. In order to better understand consumer purchase behavior for low and high priced pork cuts, a series of field interviews {{at a variety of}} food retailers were conducted with actual pork shoppers using the New Involvement Profile (NIP) developed by Jain and Srinivasan (1990). In addition to responses to a series of questions designed to assess consumers’ involvement when purchasing pork, informational elements including socio-demographic information and pork attributes (e. g., origin, advertisement, on sale) were also included in the analysis. Key results from the study show individuals with high risk factors were significantly less likely to purchase high price cuts of pork. However this factor was mitigated by high price cuts on sale. Advertising is found to engage consumers with specific factors including those individuals who place a symbolic value on pork. Similar results are found for certain individuals based upon the type of store in which shopping took place. Results from our study may help companies to develop specific strategies to target high and low involved consumer segments. For instance, focusing on particular labeling schemes to increase consumers’ trust in meat producers could be used to target high involved shoppers. Additionally, based upon the empirical evidence this would have an added benefit by supporting the purchase of higher priced cuts of pork. pork, purchase behavior, <b>consumer</b> involvement, <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale,</b> Agribusiness, Consumer/Household Economics, Marketing, C 93, D 12, Q 13,...|$|R
40|$|Meat colour is an {{important}} criterion in the appeal of meat to <b>consumers</b> at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale.</b> The bright red colour of fresh beef and lamb and the pinkish colour of fresh pork are due to the oxygenation of the myoglobin pigment when the meat is exposed to air. However, exposure to air over several days causes irreversible browning and rejection of the meat by consumers. The gaseous environment in which retail cuts are stored is therefore critical to ensure a good colour over the display life. Existing packaging systems {{do not have a}} sufficiently long storage life for the additional time required for exports from Ireland to the UK or continental Europe. The objective of this project was to develop a bulk packaging system for retail cuts that would have a sufficient shelf life to be used by the Irish industry to export retail ready cuts. In conclusion, a packaging system has been developed on a laboratory scale which is capable of extending the storage life of some beef cuts, lamb loin chops and pork loin chops. The display life of these after storage is comparable to fresh cuts. In order for this system to be commercialised {{it would have to be}} shown to work on a larger scale in a production environment.

And most of the fees are ad valorem that is, based on transaction value rather than fixed fees per transaction.; Given that debit cards incur a fixed cost per transaction, why do networks charge ad valorem fees? How do ad valorem fees affect payment market participants, including consumers, merchants, and card networks? And should policymakers consider regulating debit cards by requiring fixed per-transaction fees?; Wang explores this controversy about debit card fee structures. His analysis shows that, when card networks and merchants both have market power, card networks earn a higher profit by charging ad valorem fees than fixed per-transaction fees. At the same time, merchant profits are reduced yet both consumer surplus and social welfare are increased. As an alternative, policymakers might consider regulating the debit fee structure simply by requiring fixed per-transaction fees (but allowing card networks to freely set the fee levels). Wang suggests, however, that this alternative may increase merchant profits at the expense of card networks, consumers, and social welfare. Therefore, caution should be taken when policymakers consider intervening in the debit card market. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} {{of a large number of}} food scandals, {{societal}} interest in transparency in the food sector has grown considerably. Deficits have been discovered, which new legal frameworks of the EU and the German legislative body have attempted to address. Hence, the creation of transparency in the production process has been the focus of the legislation. In this context, traceability systems for animal-based foods, for instance, have been established (Regulation (EC) 178 / 2002). In addition to tracking and tracing, one finds in the public discussion an increasing number of demands for further information, for instance information on food safety, animal and environmental protection and generally for sustainability of the production processes for foods. This is intended as a response to the general call for more transparency or a "gläserne Produktion ". It has not been sufficiently clarified which information about the production process, and thus which level of transparency is actually desired, or can actually be processed, by <b>consumers</b> at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale.</b> This is related to the question of to what extent the demands for more transparency in meat production are influenced by new campaigns of many consumer organisations and NGOs, or whether these actually represent user preferences at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale.</b> In order to analyse this topic from the viewpoint of the consumer, a large-scale empirical study has been conducted.

40|$|The aroma {{profile of}} {{alcoholic}} beverages {{is a major}} factor that distinguishes one product from another, and it is a key attribute that drives <b>consumer</b> preference at <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sale.</b> A longstanding objective has, therefore, been to identify those aromatic compounds that are important to particular olfactory attributes of different styles of wine, beer and cider—whether perceived ortho- or retro-nasally—and to modulate them according to consumer preferences. That this has been achieved only to a relatively small extent to date is partly a reflection on the complexity of the perception of aroma mixtures and also the presence of very low concentrations of potent aroma compounds in these products. It is known, although perhaps not appreciated as widely as it should be, that aroma compounds will interact with each other, with masking or suppressing effects being probably universal for compounds at supra-threshold concentrations, together with additive interactions for compounds at sub-threshold concentrations. Thus it is likely that volatile compounds with marginal aroma impact when isolated, can together provide an influence on aroma. Some of these aroma-active compounds are produced during fermentation. Different yeasts produce differing ranges of aroma-active substances, which may greatly affect the complex flavour of a fermented product such as wine, beer and cider. While these secondary metabolites are often formed only in trace amounts, their concentrations may well determine the distinct aroma of these beverages. This chapter reviews the production of the most important aroma-active compounds produced by yeast at molecular level and seeks to understand how they might be perceived by consumers. 37 page(s...|$|R
