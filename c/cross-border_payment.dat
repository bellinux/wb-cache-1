We investigate whether distance still matters for online trade in physical goods. We use a unique dataset on online cross-border trade in goods in a linguistically fragmented EU market. The analysis confirms that distance-related trade costs are greatly reduced compared to offline trade in the same goods. However, language-related trade costs increase. Moreover, online trade introduces new sources of trade costs such as parcel delivery and online payments systems. On balance, there are no indications that online trade is less biased in favour of home market products than offline trade.

40|$|The {{notion that}} trade and capital flows drive {{exchange}} rates is {{widespread in the}} financial press but receives scant attention in economic research. The flow market model of the exchange rate has fallen out of fashion in the 1970 s, {{at a time when}} stock-oriented approaches, such as monetary and portfolio balance models, gained prominence. However, given the limited empirical success of mainstream exchange rate models over the past decades, it may be time for a reassessment of the flow market approach. The aim of this work is to demonstrate how balance of payments imbalances influence the demands for different currencies in the foreign exchange markets over time. A dynamical system approach is used to assess how international payments evolve for different sets of assumptions regarding the joint dynamic behaviour of various balance of payments components. An important finding is that while the different components of the balance of payments affect international payment flows directly in a given country, they also determine the accumulation of foreign assets and liabilities in that country, or its international investment position. However, the international investment position itself gives rise to international payments, for instance when foreign debt becomes due and is repaid or when interest payments on the existing debt stock are made. The dynamical system approach is further applied to topics such as currency crises and the exchange rate performance of commodity exporters. Two empirical essays on the important case of Japan confirm the above hypotheses. The first essay builds a vector error correction model for the nominal exchange rate and the current account in Japan. The model allows for a Markov-switching stochastic trend in the current account. The model is capable of producing the strong cycles of the current account and the gradual adjustment of the exchange rate, which can both be observed in the Japanese data. Bayesian estimation proceeds using an innovative Gibbs sampling procedure. The second essay estimates the maturity structure of Japan's foreign lending. It constructs an explicit measure of <b>cross-border</b> <b>payment</b> flows across Japanese borders, based on the estimated maturity structure of Japan's foreign lending. The simulated <b>cross-border</b> <b>payment</b> flows are shown to closely follow the movements of the Japanese exchange rate. An additional empirical essay considers the reverse question of how the current account is influenced by exchange rate fluctuations. Based on German and Japanese data, it is shown that strong exchange rate movements have tended to influence the trend of the current account, rather than its level as is typically assumed in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Unlike {{in other}} areas of the {{financial}} market, progress toward the integration of payments markets has not yet been satisfactory. While the introduction of the euro was an important step in this direction, a single European payment area for cashless payments still does not exist. Current initiatives thus aim to lay the groundwork for integrated <b>cross-border</b> <b>payment</b> transactions, in particular by harmonizing the applicable legal framework. The European Commission’s New Legal Framework for Payments in the Internal Market initiative is of special importance here. It proposes, inter alia, the introduction of a new category of payment service providers (payment institutions) in addition to credit and e-money institutions that would perform payment services under comparatively less stringent licensing and supervision regulations. Against this background, the Oesterreichische Nationalbank conducted an empirical survey among Austrian market participants (banks and nonbanks) in the summer of 2005 to assess possible competition and risk-related implications of the introduction of payment institutions on the Austrian financial market. The survey showed that most of the Austrian market participants questioned were critical of the current draft Directive and that respondents shared the European Commission’s primary expectations - for example, that it will create a level playing field - only partly or not at all. On the contrary, they fear distortions of competition, increased risks and, over the long term, a loss of confidence in the stability of the payments market among end users. There is unanimous agreement among respondents that both payment and credit institutions should be subject to the same capital and supervision requirements in order to head off these risks. Furthermore, the survey shows that none of the Austrian market participants questioned is currently considering transformation into a payment institution. Payment Institutions,...|$|E
