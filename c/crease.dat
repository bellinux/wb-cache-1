5|$|A one-vertex <b>crease</b> pattern {{consists}} {{of a set of}} rays or creases drawn on a flat sheet of paper, all emanating from the same point interior to the sheet. (This point is called the vertex of the pattern.) Each <b>crease</b> must be folded, but the pattern does not specify whether the folds should be mountain folds or valley folds. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to fold the paper so that every <b>crease</b> is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, and the whole folded sheet of paper lies flat.|$|E
5|$|Sitting {{on several}} Royal commissions, the Exchequer Court of Canada, and the BC Supreme Court, <b>Crease</b> {{remained}} an influential figure long after his {{defeat in the}} Thrasher case. However, federal Justice Minister Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper was not impressed with Crease's judgment {{toward the end of}} his career and pushed for Crease's retirement in a letter to BC Supreme Court Chief Justice Theodore Davie. <b>Crease</b> retired soon afterward in January 1896. On 23 January 1896 <b>Crease</b> was knighted. He died in 1905 and was buried at Ross Bay Cemetery in Victoria.|$|E

40|$|Palm <b>creases</b> {{are helpful}} in {{revealing}} anthropologic characteristics and diagnosing chromosomal aberrations, {{and have been}} analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. However, previous methods of analyzing palm <b>creases</b> were not objective so that reproducibility could not be guaranteed. In this study, a more objective morphologic analysis of palm <b>creases</b> was developed. The features of the improved methods include the strict definition of major and minor palm <b>creases</b> and the systematic classification of major palm <b>creases</b> based on their relationships, branches, and variants. Furthermore, based on the analysis of 3, 216 Koreans, palm <b>creases</b> were anthropologically interpreted. There was a tendency for palm <b>creases</b> to be evenly distributed on the palm, which was acknowledged by the relationship between major and minor <b>creases</b> {{as well as by}} the incidences of major <b>creases</b> types. This tendency was consistent with the role of palm <b>creases</b> to facilitate folding of palm skin. The union of major palm <b>creases</b> was frequent in males and right palms to have powerful hand grip. The new method of analyzing palm <b>creases</b> is expected to be widely used for anthropologic investigation and chromosomal diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|<b>Creasing</b> is a {{recurrent}} problem in sweet orange fruit. Higher levels of endogenous ethylene and {{lower levels of}} free polyamines (PAs) initiate the incidence of <b>creasing</b> in sweet orange fruit. The reduction of <b>creasing</b> with exogenous application of ethylene inhibitors such as putrescine, aminoethoxyvinylglycine, cobalt sulphate and acceleration of <b>creasing</b> with inhibitor of PAs biosynthesis and exogenous application of ethrel signifies the involvement of PAs and ethylene in <b>creasing</b> of sweet orange fruit...|$|R
5|$|An {{equivalent}} way of {{stating the}} same condition is that, if the angles are partitioned into two alternating subsets, then {{the sum of}} the angles in either of the two subsets is exactly 180 degrees. However, this equivalent form applies only to a <b>crease</b> pattern on a flat piece of paper, whereas the alternating sum form of the condition remains valid for <b>crease</b> patterns on conical sheets of paper with nonzero defect at the vertex.|$|E

Hall and <b>Crease</b> had known each other for years, and <b>Crease</b> had once employed him as his agent in a dispute with trespassers who illegally logged on land he and his friend Robert Burnaby owned near Hall's ranch. Hall was found guilty of manslaughter, and his land signed over to his attorney to pay for his defence.|$|E

By reviewing the relationship between citrus fruit <b>creasing</b> or cracking and peel mechanical properties, the cellular wall ultrastructure, cellular wall metabolism and modification, this paper summarized the mechanism of citrus <b>creasing</b> or cracking and further explained the effects of genetic factors and environmental factors (light, temperature, humidity, mineral nutrition and plant growth regulators) on citrus fruit <b>creasing</b> or cracking rate. Further studies were proposed to provide a sound theoretical basis on citrus fruit <b>creasing</b> or cracking...|$|R
50|$|In the {{mathematics}} of paper folding, map folding and stamp folding are two problems of counting {{the number of}} ways that a piece of paper can be folded. In the stamp folding problem, the paper is a strip of stamps with <b>creases</b> between them, and the folds must lie on the <b>creases.</b> In the map folding problem, the paper is a map, divided by <b>creases</b> into rectangles, and the folds must again lie only along these <b>creases.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Creases</b> on the brain's surface {{are formed}} {{as a result of}} instability, and {{tangential}} growth models reach levels of instability that cause <b>creasing</b> more frequently than isotropic models.

5|$|In {{the next}} match against Oxford University, Loxton {{came in at}} 4/206 and {{anchored}} the innings, remaining unbeaten on 79 as Australia were bowled out for 431. He featured in partnerships with Colin McCool and Doug Ring, who both made fifties. He then took the new ball in both innings, taking 1/14 and 1/16 from five and eight overs respectively in another innings victory. When Oxford batted, Philip Whitcombe struck a delivery from Ernie Toshack to Loxton, and {{took a few steps}} out of his <b>crease.</b> Loxton prepared to throw at the Whitcombe's stumps in a run out attempt, but did not release, while Whitcombe stood his ground outside the <b>crease.</b> In those days, the fielding standards were lower, with weaker and less accurate throws and Whitcombe was only a metre or two outside his <b>crease,</b> while Loxton was around thirty away. The next delivery from Toshack was again hit to Loxton, and Whitcombe again wandered outside his <b>crease.</b> This time Loxton threw the ball and hit the stumps directly, running out the batsman, who was unable to comprehend what had happened and shook his head.|$|E
5|$|Politically, <b>Crease</b> {{presented}} {{himself as a}} foe of the Hudson's Bay Company's hegemony over the colony, and in 1860 {{was elected to the}} Vancouver Island House of Assembly as an independent member representing Victoria. However, he was soon criticised by the British Colonist (a paper run by opposition leader Amor de Cosmos) for being too cozy with the HBC-backed government. The following year, as if to prove de Cosmos right, governor Sir James Douglas appointed <b>Crease</b> Attorney-General of British Columbia, and <b>Crease</b> resigned his seat in the Assembly. He was a key member of the government, responsible for pushing literally hundreds of laws through the legislature, in between his continuing circuit tours, most of which was concerned with regulating the resource-based economic activity of the colony, including land settlement and gold mining. His legislation cemented his reputation as an advocate of free trade.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his arrival}} in Victoria, <b>Crease</b> was {{admitted}} as a barrister to the courts of Vancouver Island and British Columbia, becoming the first lawyer qualified to practice in both jurisdictions. <b>Crease</b> opened a practice in Victoria, sent for his family, and soon found himself travelling with Supreme Court Judge Matthew Baillie Begbie on his first circuit, dealing out justice on the frontier as a Crown prosecutor {{in the midst of}} the Gold Rush.|$|E
40|$|Subject to compression, elastic {{materials}} may undergo bifurcation {{of various}} kinds. A ho-mogeneous material forms <b>creases,</b> whereas a bilayer {{consisting of a}} stiff film and a com-pliant substrate forms wrinkles. Here, we show several new types of bifurcation behavior for bilayers consisting of films and substrates of comparable elastic moduli. Depending on the ratios of moduli and thicknesses of the two materials, the critical strain for the onset of <b>creases</b> can be either smaller or larger than that for the onset of wrinkles. When the critical strain for the onset of <b>creases</b> is {{lower than that of}} wrinkles, <b>creases</b> can be subcritical or supercritical. When the critical strain for the onset of wrinkles is lower than that of <b>creases,</b> wrinkles can further channel to <b>creases</b> at a strain much lower than the critical strain for the onset of <b>creases</b> in a homogeneous material. Experiments, con-ducted with bilayer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) structures subject to compressive load-ing, show that the different types of bifurcation behavior agree with the theoretical predictions.

5|$|Australia {{was still}} some way behind when Lindwall {{replaced}} Johnson at the <b>crease.</b> Fifteen runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93, who appeared disappointed at playing such a wild cross-batted swing with a maiden Test century beckoning. Saggers {{came in and}} only managed five in his first Test innings before being stumped after being lured out of his <b>crease</b> by Laker, who was still bowling in an attacking manner and flighting his deliveries, undeterred by the sixes Loxton had hit from him, rather than bowling leg theory. This left Australia at 355/8 ten minutes before tea, with only Johnston and Toshack remaining.|$|E
5|$|For the {{following}} match against Gloucestershire before the Third Test, Brown did not play. Harvey {{came to the}} <b>crease</b> at 3/304 and put on 164 for the fourth wicket before his partner Morris was out for 294. He put on another 63 with Loxton before falling for 95. During his innings, Harvey repeatedly advanced out of the <b>crease</b> to attack the spinners. Loxton ended on 159 not out as Australia reached 7/774 declared, their highest score of the tour, which underpinned a dominant innings victory. Harvey and the other Australian batsmen repeatedly left their <b>crease</b> to charge and attack the off spin of Tom Goddard, who ended with 0/186. Goddard had been touted as a possible England selection because the bowlers used {{in the first two}} Tests had failed to challenge the supremacy of Australiaâ€™s batsmen, but the touristsâ€™ attack ended his prospects. Loxton's innings earned him Brown's middle-order position for the Third Test at Old Trafford, which was a rain-affected draw.|$|E

5|$|Woodfull {{was known}} for his gentlemanly nature and his {{adherence}} to the spirit of the game. Aside from refusing to retaliate against bodyline, Woodfull refused to exploit loopholes to dismiss batsmen. On one occasion, Jack Fingleton was run out after wandering out of the <b>crease</b> to inspect the <b>crease,</b> without intending to run. A teammate broke the wicket and the umpire upheld the appeal, but Woodfull called Fingleton back. He led his team in an understated way, preferring to give broad objectives to his players and trusting them to choose their own methods to fulfil the task at hand. However, he was known to organise his team tightly on tour to ensure that things proceeded smoothly.|$|E
5|$|A {{forward is}} a player {{position}} on the field whose responsibility is primarily offensive. Typically, a forward is dominant throwing with one hand or the other, and will primarily play {{on that side of}} the floor. Some players, known as creasemen, do not focus on one side or the other. These players instead focus their offensive attention near the <b>crease</b> area in front of the goaltender.|$|E

5|$|After the {{resumption}} of play, Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 without adding to his lunch score, ending an 87-run partnership with Miller, and bringing Lindwall to the <b>crease</b> at 416/5. Miller and Lindwall attacked at every opportunity before the declaration. Miller's innings was noted for its driving, and he was out for 74, playing a hook shot that was caught by Bedser at square leg from Laker in pursuit of quick runs. He was followed by Lindwall, who ran out of his <b>crease</b> in attempt to hit Laker across the line to the boundary, missed, and was stumped for 25, prompting Bradman to declare with Australia at 460/7 with a lead of 595 runs. The tourists had added 51 runs {{for the loss of}} three wickets in approximately an hour's batting after lunch. Yardley and Laker had been the only multiple wicket-takers, with two each. The Australians had punished the spinners the most, taking more than 3.50 runs per over from each of Wright, Laker and Compton. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match.|$|E

40|$|<b>Creasing</b> is a {{physiological}} disorder in navel oranges and causes serious economic losses. In 2007, the comparative changes in rheological {{properties of the}} rind, levels of starch, phenolics, pectins and the activity of pectinesterase (PE) in albedo and flavedo tissues of the healthy and the <b>creased</b> fruit of â€˜Washington Navelâ€™ and â€˜Navelinaâ€™ sweet orange at ripe stage were investigated. During 2009, dynamics of the activities of PE, exo and endo polygalacturonase (exo-PG, endo-PG), and endo- 1, 4 -ÃŸ -D-glucanase (EGase) enzymes in albedo and flavedo tissues of the healthy {{as well as the}} <b>creased</b> â€˜Washington Navelâ€™ sweet orange fruit at different maturation and ripening stages were researched. The rind hardness, stiffness and tensile force were substantially lower in the <b>creased</b> fruit than the healthy ones in â€˜Washington Navelâ€™ and â€˜Navelinaâ€™. The levels of starch, total phenolics, total pectins and water insoluble pectins decreased in the albedo and flavedo of the <b>creased</b> than the healthy fruit in both the cultivars. The levels of water soluble pectins increased in the albedo and flavedo of the <b>creased</b> fruit when compared to the healthy ones in both the cultivars. The activities of PE in albedo and flavedo tissues were higher in the <b>creased</b> fruit when compared to the healthy fruit of â€˜Washington Navelâ€™ and â€˜Navelinaâ€™ in 2007. The activities of PE, exo and endo PG and Endo- 1, 4 -ÃŸ -D-glucanase were higher in the albedo tissue of <b>creased</b> fruit of â€˜Washington Navelâ€™ orange at different fruit maturation and ripening stages. In conclusion, the higher activities of pectinesterase, exo- polygalacturonase, endo- polygalacturonase, and endo- 1, 4 -ÃŸ -D-glucanase in the albedo of <b>creased</b> fruit at commercial harvest seem {{to be associated with the}} enhanced loss of pectins and starch in the cell walls of albedo tissue, leading to cell wall loosening and cracks formation consequently reducing hardness, stiffness and tensile force of the rind...|$|R
40|$|Most origami, both {{practical}} and mathematical, uses just straight <b>creases.</b> Curved <b>creases,</b> {{on the other}} hand, offer a wealth of new design possibilities. While the first curved-crease models {{date back to the}} Bauhaus in the 1930 s, curved <b>creasing</b> remains relatively underexplored. The principal challenge considered here is to understand what 3 D forms result as natural resting state(s) after folding a set of curved <b>creases,</b> with the potential to enable a new category of design. This problem goes beyond the mathematics of developable surfaces to a question of physics: equilibria of an unstretchable surface with uncreased and <b>creased</b> (plastically deformed) portions folding elastically toward desired angles. Two natural approaches for experimenting with this question are computer simulation and building real models. We follow the latter approach, being more interested in how real materials behave and how the resulting structures might be applied in the field of architecture...|$|R
40|$|The <b>creasing</b> {{instability}} of elastomer films under compression is studied {{by a combination}} of experiment and numerical simulation. Experimentally, we attach a stress-free film on a much thicker and stiffer pre-stretched substrate. When the substrate is partially released, the film is uniaxially compressed, leading to formation of an array of <b>creases</b> beyond a critical strain. The profile of the folded surface is extracted using confocal fluorescence microscopy, yielding the depths, spacings, and shapes of <b>creases.</b> Numerically, the onset and development of <b>creases</b> are simulated by introducing appropriately sized defects into a finite-element mesh and allowing the surface of the film to self-contact. The measurements and simulations are found to be in excellent agreement.
