5|$|We {{wanted a}} place and a time that could {{reproduce}} {{to a certain extent}} the <b>claustrophobia</b> and the sordidness of medieval England, {{and the best way to}} do that is to set it in the middle of a war.|$|E
5|$|While incarcerated at Utah State Prison, Taylor kept busy in {{an effort}} to {{overcome}} his <b>claustrophobia</b> and boredom. He earned his high school diploma and studied to be a paralegal until his educational grant money ran out.|$|E
5|$|It is {{recommended}} that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary gland is performed if the diagnosis is suspected; this has a sensitivity of over 90% for detecting pituitary apoplexy; it may demonstrate infarction (tissue damage due to a decreased blood supply) or hemorrhage. Different MRI sequences {{can be used to}} establish when the apoplexy occurred, and the predominant form of damage (hemorrhage or infarction). If MRI is not suitable (e.g. due to <b>claustrophobia</b> or the presence of metal-containing implants), a computed tomography (CT) scan may demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary gland, although it is less reliable. Many pituitary tumors (25%) are found to have areas of hemorrhagic infarction on MRI scans, but apoplexy is not said to exist unless it is accompanied by symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began in}} late 2003 at Barrandov Studios in Prague, Czech Republic, {{where most of}} the filming took place. Production {{designer}} Richard Bridgland was in charge of sets, props and vehicles, based on early concept art Anderson had created to give a broad direction of how things would look. 25 to 30 life-sized sets were constructed at Barrandov Studios, many of which were interiors of the pyramid. The pyramid's carvings, sculptures, and hieroglyphs were influenced by Egyptian, Cambodian, and Aztec civilisations, while the regular shifting of the pyramid's rooms was meant to evoke a sense of <b>claustrophobia</b> similar to the original Alien film. According to Anderson, if he was to build the sets in Los Angeles they would have cost $20 million. However, in Prague they cost $2 million, an important factor when the film's budget was less than $50 million.|$|E
5|$|While the {{individual}} diver cannot predict exactly at what depth {{the onset of}} narcosis will occur on a given day, the first symptoms of narcosis for any given diver are often more predictable and personal. For example, one diver may have trouble with eye focus (close accommodation for middle-aged divers), another may experience feelings of euphoria, and another feelings of <b>claustrophobia.</b> Some divers report that they have hearing changes, and that the sound their exhaled bubbles make becomes different. Specialist training may help divers to identify these personal onset signs, which may then {{be used as a}} signal to ascend to avoid the narcosis, although severe narcosis may interfere with the judgement necessary to take preventive action.|$|E
5|$|Charlie Cutter first {{appears in}} Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He {{is a friend}} of Nate's and is also shown to know Elena to some extent when she {{inquires}} about his well-being. It is apparent that he suffers from severe <b>claustrophobia,</b> requiring a lot of prompting just to squeeze through tight spaces. He is first introduced as one of Marlowe's henchmen, although it is soon apparent that he was an inside man. He helps Nate, Chloe, and Sully {{in the first part of}} the game with finding the clues to the location of Ubar, the Atlantis of the Sands. He gets injured when jumping off a tower in Syria and tells Nate to go on and stop Marlowe out of revenge. Despite looking like a blunt, common thug, he appears to be well educated, quoting John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men and correcting Sully's mistake when quoting Macbeth. He is voiced by and modeled after Graham McTavish, who previously voiced Lazarevic in the second game.|$|E
5|$|Writing the {{screenplay}} took about six months. During this period, Gidding worked alone, {{and although he}} passed some of his work to Wise to show him that work on {{the screenplay}} was progressing well, he and Wise did not otherwise collaborate on the screenplay. The screenplay made other changes to the story. The number of characters was cut down, the back story was significantly shortened, most of the supernatural events depicted in the novel were kept off-screen, and {{the greater part of}} the action was set inside the house to heighten the audience's feeling of <b>claustrophobia.</b> Eleanor's role as an outcast was also emphasized. The character of Theodora was given a sharper, slightly more cruel sense of humor in order to make her a foil for Eleanor but also to heighten Eleanor's outsider status. The role of Luke was made more flippant, and Dr. Markway (Montague in the novel) was made a more confident character. The screenplay was finished just after Wise completed work on West Side Story.|$|E
25|$|In January 2002 Kines {{began writing}} <b>Claustrophobia.</b> It {{had only three}} main {{speaking}} roles, which were given to Melanie Lynskey, Sheeri Rappaport, and Mary Lynn Rajskub. Judith O'Dea (who had starred in the classic zombie film Night of the Living Dead) also appeared in a small, non-speaking role.|$|E
25|$|The Ribeira Palace, {{as well as}} most of {{the city}} of Lisbon, was {{destroyed}} in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. After the earthquake, the reigning monarch, King José I, suffered from <b>claustrophobia</b> and chose to live {{the rest of his life}} in a group of pavilions in the hills of Ajuda, and thus the palace was never rebuilt.|$|E
25|$|Despite her conniving and vindictive nature, {{she often}} {{displays}} tender and genuine compassion toward family and loved one. For {{the duration of}} the serial, Dorian suffers from <b>claustrophobia,</b> which is explained {{to be the result of}} her mother Sonya's child abuse (actress Strasser states stated that this character trait was added to mirror her actual illness).|$|E
25|$|Virtual reality {{exposure}} {{therapy is}} also commonly used for treating specific phobias, especially small animal phobia. Commonly feared {{animals such as}} spiders can be easily produced in a virtual environment, rather than requiring the therapist or researcher to go find the real-life counterpart. This technique has also been used experimentally to treat other fears such as public speaking and <b>claustrophobia.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{disadvantage}} of the MRI scan {{in the face}} of aortic dissection is that it has limited availability and is often located only in larger hospitals, and the scan is relatively time-consuming, which may be dangerous in people who are already very unwell. Due to the high-intensity magnetic fields used during MRI, it is contraindicated in individuals with metallic implants. In addition, many individuals experience <b>claustrophobia</b> while in the MRI scanning tube.|$|E
25|$|To {{increase}} {{the feeling of}} <b>claustrophobia</b> in Sunshine, Boyle refused to cut back to scenes on Earth, a traditional technique in most films about the planet in jeopardy. The director also maintained an atmosphere of confinement in Sunshine by avoiding filming the primary ship, Icarus II, from the outside. There {{are only a few}} outside shots of the ship. He also attempted to avoid filming star field backgrounds, keeping the ship's exterior pitch black, but he was ultimately compelled to show stars outside the spacecraft to help convey a sense of the ship's movement.|$|E
25|$|The gold-leaf {{shielding}} in Sunshine {{was influenced}} by NASA satellite designs for deflecting heat {{and other forms of}} radiant energy. Boyle designed the gold-coloured space suits along these lines despite persistent encouragement to model them after the NASA template. The helmets were designed to have cameras mounted in them. This further enhanced a sense of <b>claustrophobia</b> useful to the actors in delivering more heartfelt performances. The helmets were also limited to a horizontal slit for visibility instead of a full-face visor as further consideration toward protecting the characters from the ambient radiation of outer space. According to Boyle, the funnel shape of the helmet {{was influenced by}} the character Kenny from South Park.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} risk to {{participants}} in an fMRI study is <b>claustrophobia</b> {{and there are}} reported risks for pregnant women {{to go through the}} scanning process. Scanning sessions also subject participants to loud high-pitched noises from Lorentz forces induced in the gradient coils by the rapidly switching current in the powerful static field. The gradient switching can also induce currents in the body causing nerve tingling. Implanted medical devices such as pacemakers could malfunction because of these currents. The radio-frequency field of the excitation coil may heat up the body, and this has to be monitored more carefully in those running a fever, the diabetic, and those with circulatory problems. Local burning from metal necklaces and other jewellery is also a risk.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, a US$44 million {{renovation}} of the complex began. The goal was to reduce congestion and improve rider access, comfort and safety by improving visual lines and increasing pedestrian capacity. The main corridor was widened , {{and the number of}} sharp corners reduced; ADA accessibility was introduced with elevators; new escalators; and other corridors were widened. The mezzanine above the BMT Broadway Line, formerly a record shop, now features a large oval balcony looking over the trackway and has reduced the sense of <b>claustrophobia</b> described by many riders. In 2004, four unisex stall bathrooms were opened on the mezzanine between the IRT and BMT lines; they are staffed and maintained by employees of the Times Square Alliance, the local Business Improvement District. The record shop re-opened in 2007 {{on the south side of}} the IRT/BMT corridor.|$|E
25|$|Madden's fear {{of flying}} (aviophobia) is well known. Two {{different}} theories have developed as to the cause. One theory relates to the October 29, 1960, Cal Poly football team plane crash that {{claimed the lives of}} sixteen players, the team’s student manager, and a football booster. Having graduated from Cal Poly only two years prior, Madden lost many friends in the accident. However, it is known that Madden flew up until 1979, when he had a panic attack on a flight originating in Tampa. The details, nature and extent of this panic attack are not known. Madden, however, stated once in an interview that his fears were not about turbulence, flying, or heights, but primarily <b>claustrophobia.</b> He also once noted that when he did fly, traveling all over the United States, it did not allow him to see anything.|$|E
25|$|One {{disadvantage}} is {{the patient}} has to hold still {{for long periods of}} time in a noisy, cramped space while the imaging is performed. <b>Claustrophobia</b> severe enough to terminate the MRI exam is reported in up to 5% of patients. Recent improvements in magnet design including stronger magnetic fields (3 teslas), shortening exam times, wider, shorter magnet bores and more open magnet designs, have brought some relief for claustrophobic patients. However, for magnets with equivalent field strengths, there is often a trade-off between image quality and open design. MRI has great benefit in imaging the brain, spine, and musculoskeletal system. The use of MRI is currently contraindicated for patients with pacemakers, cochlear implants, some indwelling medication pumps, certain types of cerebral aneurysm clips, metal fragments in the eyes and some metallic hardware due to the powerful magnetic fields and strong fluctuating radio signals to which the body is exposed. Areas of potential advancement include functional imaging, cardiovascular MRI, and MRI-guided therapy.|$|E
25|$|Module 1 assesses a candidate's {{level of}} {{physical}} fitness, motivation and suitability to progress on towards further modules (2-5) of the SOFQ course {{similar to the}} previous selection course. Candidates must pass a series of fitness assessments, map reading and individual navigation assessments, <b>claustrophobia,</b> water confidence, and psychometric testing. The final phase of Module 1 includes individual navigation exercises with set weights over unknown distances and completion times which can be over 250km, culminating in an additional 65km cross-country march carrying a 65lb combat load in the Dublin & Wicklow mountain range. On average candidates get between four and five hours sleep per a night. Officer and senior NCO candidates are subjected to separate, rigorous scrutiny of their planning and decision-making skills to determine the suitability. The length of Module 1 is 3 weeks similar to the previous selection course length. Typically 85% of candidates fail Module 1. Between 2000 and 2005, approximately 240 attempted selection, including a female, with 50 successful.|$|E
25|$|Fear can {{be learned}} by {{experiencing}} or watching a frightening traumatic accident. For example, if a child falls into a well and struggles to get out, {{he or she may}} develop a fear of wells, heights (acrophobia), enclosed spaces (<b>claustrophobia),</b> or water (aquaphobia). There are studies looking at areas of the brain that are affected in relation to fear. When looking at these areas (such as the amygdala), it was proposed that a person learns to fear regardless of whether they themselves have experienced trauma, or if they have observed the fear in others. In a study completed by Andreas Olsson, Katherine I. Nearing and Elizabeth A. Phelps the amygdala were affected both when subjects observed someone else being submitted to an aversive event, knowing that the same treatment awaited themselves, and when subjects were subsequently placed in a fear-provoking situation. This suggests that fear can develop in both conditions, not just simply from personal history.|$|E
25|$|The {{memorial}} {{is shaped}} like a ship's prow; the crypt is accessible by two staircases and a lowered square protected by a metal portcullis. The crypt leads to a hexagonal rotunda that includes two chapels containing earth and bones from concentration camps. The walls display literary excerpts. Pingusson intended that its long and narrow subterranean space convey a feeling of <b>claustrophobia.</b> The memorial's entrance is narrow, marked by two concrete blocks. Inside is the tomb of an unknown deportee who was killed at the camp in Neustadt. Along both walls of the narrow, dimly lit chamber are 200,000 glass crystals with light shining through, meant to symbolize each of the deportees {{who died in the}} concentration camps; {{at the end of the}} tunnel is a single bright light. Ashes from the camps, contained within urns, are positioned at both lateral ends. Both ends of the chamber have small rooms that seem to depict prison cells. Opposite the entrance is a stark iron gate overlooking the Seine at the tip of the Île de la Cité.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} this, {{there are no}} CG cars {{incorporated}} in the actual film. [...] "It was a possibility in the beginning so we did some dynamics tests using the logs as rigid bodies to hit cars with soft body deformers on them, but {{when they were done}} shooting they didn’t end up needing any CG cars," [...] Crosby avowed. Lifecasts of the actors were also used for all of the death scenes, including the highway setting. Landes experienced <b>claustrophobia</b> during the procedure. Fake blood was also used, but CG blood was also shown.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{took place}} in Los Angeles and Italy in June and July 2009. Benicio del Toro, Erin Wasson {{and members of the}} band Rooney have cameos in the film. In a feature for The New York Times website, Coppola {{discussed}} making the scene when Marco visits a special effects studio. She said she initially was unsure of how to approach it, but Savides did a long, slow zoom which captures his breathing and creates a sense of <b>claustrophobia.</b> Despite many takes, Dorff was a [...] "good sport", she said. The sound of the phone ringing was added by Sarah Flack, the editor, to indicate that Marco has been forgotten.|$|E
500|$|Belgian {{director}} and screenwriter Joachim Lafosse released Our Children, a film {{based on the}} story, to positive reviews in 2012. One reviewer called the film a [...] "gloomy and penetrating psychological drama" [...] that portrays the <b>claustrophobia</b> of a protagonist who lives in {{an environment in which}} [...] "the walls are constantly closing in around her." [...] Our Children also attained an 93% rating on the aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes. Émilie Dequenne, a French-speaking Belgian actress, played the character based on Genevieve Lhermitte. Dequenne won the Un Certain Regard Award at the Cannes Film Festival and [...] "Best Actress" [...] at the Saint Petersburg International Film Festival for her role.|$|E
500|$|The story {{takes place}} {{entirely in the}} bedroom of a country house, {{with much of the}} filming taking place inside the wardrobe. Pemberton and Shearsmith wrote the episode with the {{intention}} of evoking a feeling of <b>claustrophobia</b> in viewers. In addition to the writers, the episode starred Katherine Parkinson, Tim Key, Luke Pasqualino, Ophelia Lovibond, Anne Reid, Julian Rhind-Tutt, Anna Chancellor, Marc Wootton, Ben Willbond and Timothy West. The cast and writing were praised by television critics, and the episode was chosen as pick of the day in a number of publications. On its first showing, [...] "Sardines" [...] was watched by 1.1 million viewers, which was 5.6% of the audience.|$|E
500|$|There is {{a lengthy}} study of Missoula {{in the title}} essay of Jonathan Raban's Driving Home: An American Journey: despite writing that on his arrival, [...] "I had the {{powerful}} impression that I had driven deep into the Rocky Mountains and somehow arrived in Rotherham or Barnsley," [...] and that [...] "the overall effect [...] was oddly unsettling; the streets too open for comfort, the town too closed in, inducing mild <b>claustrophobia</b> and agoraphobia at the same time", he notes the literary heritage {{of the city and}} its reputation as a [...] "kindly town" [...] (evidenced by its being a place where [...] "odds and ends naturally collected and cohered").|$|E
500|$|On {{the fictional}} world {{depicted}} in the album and promotional campaign, the Cleveland Free Times commented that the album's fictionalized world and characters [...] "often seemed heavy-handed and forced", but also conceded that [...] "its clotted <b>claustrophobia</b> suited its subject matter". Ann Powers added, [...] "The songs on 'Year Zero,' each {{from the perspective of}} a character or characters already existent in the ARG, draw a connection between the music fan's passionate identification with songs and the gamer's experience of becoming someone else online." [...] In 2008, 42 Entertainment won two Webby Awards for its work on the Year Zero game, in the categories of [...] "Integrated Campaigns" [...] and [...] "Other Advertising: Branded Content".|$|E
500|$|St. Anger marked {{another large}} {{change in the}} band's sound. Guitar solos were {{excluded}} from the album, leaving a [...] "raw and unpolished sound". The band used drop C tuning; Ulrich's snare drum received particular criticism. New York Magazines Ethan Brown said it [...] "reverberates with a thwong". The album's lyrics deal with Hetfield's drug rehabilitation and include references to the devil, anti-drug themes, <b>claustrophobia,</b> impending doom, and religious hypocrisy. At the advice of producer Rick Rubin, for its ninth studio album Death Magnetic, the band returned to standard tuning and guitar solos. As a return to Metallica's thrash roots, Death Magnetic was a riff-oriented album featuring intense guitar solos and subtle lyrics dealing with suicide and redemption.|$|E
500|$|Terrance Dicks {{has felt}} that Moonbase 3 was {{ultimately}} a failure: [...] "The trouble was {{we built a}} too restrictive format for ourselves" [...] and that the series [...] "lacked a sense of wonder and outrageousness". [...] Academic Peter Wright has said about Moonbase 3 that its [...] "appeal to realism resulted in a disquieting sense of <b>claustrophobia</b> and isolation that undermined the optimism of its premise and captured the general mood of insularity felt (and often desired) in Britain in the early 1970s". [...] Moonbase 3, although not directly influential, {{can be seen as}} an antecedent of similar realistic, near-future, British space series such as Star Cops and Space Island One.|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} episode [...] "Afterimage", Ezri must {{cope with the}} reactions of Jadzia's former friends to the return of Dax. Worf (Michael Dorn), Jadzia's widower, reacts poorly, and Garak (Andrew Robinson) begins to suffer from the symptoms of acute <b>claustrophobia.</b> Together, Ezri and Garak work through his issues, resulting in her realising that she can remain on the station and Starfleet agreeing to her skipping her final periods of training and receiving a promotion from ensign to lieutenant (junior grade) based on the past experiences of the Dax symbiont. In [...] "The Siege of AR-558", Ezri is forced to rely on her symbiont's past experiences after she {{and the other members}} of the Defiant crew end up fighting against the Jem'Hadar on the front lines.|$|E
500|$|Shooting often ran for 12 {{hours at}} a time and led to {{frequent}} minor injuries among the cast and production staff, while some developed intense feelings of <b>claustrophobia</b> in the confined space. Gordon suggests that the uncomfortable working conditions made the performances of the cast more realistic, but concedes that although, [...] "I think all this paid off {{in terms of what we}} got on the screen for the budget, but the circumstances were very difficult." [...] In the absence of suitable facilities inside the caves, the personnel established administrative, dressing and make-up rooms in a car park some distance from the filming area. Co-writer Nick Maley reprised his role as a special effects technician to produce the infant twin props that appear in the climax of the film.|$|E
500|$|Give Up was {{generally}} well received by music critics. It holds {{a score of}} 79 out of 100 on review aggregate site Metacritic, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Matt LeMay of online music magazine Pitchfork called the album [...] "a pretty damned strong record, and one with enough transcendent moments to forgive it its few substandard tracks and ungodly lyrical blunders". Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Ben Gibbard radiates <b>claustrophobia,</b> so the shut-in synth-pop of this side project fits him like a leotard", calling Give Up [...] "the near-perfect pop record that's eluded his main group." [...] The Village Voices Robert Christgau praised its [...] "staying power" [...] and felt that [...] "Gibbard's delicate voice matches the subtle electro arrangements far more precisely than it does the folky guitars of his real group".|$|E
500|$|The {{cast and}} crew were unhappy with the rock prop used in the episode. Visual effects {{supervisor}} Glenn Neufeld strapped Visitor's feet to the stage {{in order to ensure}} that the crystal didn't move. Different versions of the crystal were then applied for different scenes, with the larger versions incorporating a seat for the actress so that she could relax inside the prop between takes. The prop caused problems for Visitor due to her <b>claustrophobia,</b> which was the second time during season three that a Wolfe scripted episode had caused her these types of problems after [...] "". She also didn't like how it appeared on screen: [...] "I thought it was going to look like my body turning to stone. Instead I looked like a big old hot fudge sundae, and my head was the cherry on top." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Regal Zone", {{featuring}} saxophone by McKay, also {{covers the}} subject of war and is about the conflict in Iran. [...] "Placebo Effect" [...] addresses the use of placebos in medicine, while [...] "Icon" [...] displays echoes of iconoclasm, with the destruction of paintings featuring religious images, or statues and symbols of old authoritarian regimes. [...] "Premature Burial", [...] "ostensibly inspired" [...] by Edgar Allan Poe's short story of the same name, is the track from which the album title had been taken. It is, in Siouxsie's words, [...] "an expression of <b>claustrophobia,</b> of being hemmed in both by society's and people's limitations". For the writer Mark Paytress, the line [...] "We're all sisters and brothers" [...] looked like {{a mockery of the}} Summer of Love. The song's conclusion features what sounds like [...] "a formal choir backing for a retreating Red Army in its magnificent defeat".|$|E
500|$|Van Gogh's {{mother came}} from a prosperous family in The Hague, and his father was the {{youngest}} son of a minister. The two met when Anna's younger sister, Cornelia, married Theodorus's older brother Vincent (Cent). Van Gogh's parents married in May 1851 and moved to Zundert. His brother Theo was born on 1 May 1857. There was another brother, Cor, and three sisters: Elisabeth, Anna, and Willemina (known as [...] "Wil"). In later life Van Gogh remained in touch only with Willemina and Theo. Van Gogh's mother was a rigid and religious woman who emphasised {{the importance of family}} to the point of <b>claustrophobia</b> for those around her. Theodorus's salary was modest, but the Church supplied the family with a house, a maid, two cooks, a gardener, a carriage and horse, and Anna instilled in the children a duty to uphold the family's high social position.|$|E
