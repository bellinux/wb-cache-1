5|$|An {{area known}} as the Marius Hills was {{considered}} for Apollo 15, but it was determined by mission planners that a landing {{on the edge of}} Mare Imbrium at the Hadley-Apennine site would be more scientifically fruitful than the Marius Hills alternative, and placing a seismometer at Hadley-Apennine, given the locations of seismic packages from previous Apollo expeditions, would <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> optimal configuration for seismic study.|$|E

5|$|Erosion acting upon {{different}} types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, domes, and other features we see today. These joints and fracture systems do not move, and are therefore not faults. Spacing between joints {{is controlled by the}} amount of silica in the granite and granodiorite rocks; more silica tends to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> resistant rock, resulting in larger spaces between joints and fractures.|$|E
5|$|He uses {{overlapping}} forms {{rather than}} a single form or distinct adjacent forms, which seems to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> dynamic feel to the shallow space. However, since Lichtenstein does not uses shading or contrast, the monochromatic strokes with just bold black outlines are void of certain elements of depth. Big Painting No. 6 and Yellow and Green Brushstrokes go one step further in terms of canvas size and dynamic activity that was presented earlier in Little Big Painting.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Sega {{restructured}} {{its internal}} studios {{in preparation for}} the Saturn's launch. To ensure high-quality 3D games would be available early in the Saturn's life, and to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> energetic working environment, developers from Sega's arcade division were asked to create console games. New teams, such as Panzer Dragoon developer Team Andromeda, were formed during this time.|$|E

But, again, this proved so effective with early audiences it was retained as the main trailer, since it created anticipation {{for the rest of}} the film without giving anything away.|$|E
5|$|A {{spin-off}} prequel show, First of the Summer Wine, premiered on BBC1 in 1988. The new programme {{was written}} by Roy Clarke and used different actors to follow {{the activities of the}} principal characters from Last of the Summer Wine {{in the months leading up}} to World War II. Unlike its mother show, First of the Summer Wine was not filmed in Holmfirth. Period music was used instead of Ronnie Hazlehurst's score to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> World War II era atmosphere. New supporting characters were added to those from Last of the Summer Wine. Peter Sallis and Jonathan Linsley were the only actors from the original series to appear in the spin-off: Sallis played the father of his own character from the original show and Linsley appeared during the second series as a different character.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century, the abbey, by then {{partially}} roofless and overgrown with trees and ivy, had become a famous ruin that attracted the attention of artists, dramatists and poets. In the nineteenth century, Netley became a popular tourist attraction (the novelist Jane Austen was among those who visited) and steps were taken to conserve the ruins. Archaeological excavations directed by Charles Pink and Reverend Edmund Kell took place in 1860. During the same period the owners decided to remove many of the Tudor additions to the building to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> medieval feel to the site, resulting in the loss of much evidence of the abbey's post-Dissolution story.|$|E

5|$|Development of Invisible War began {{following}} {{the success of}} Deus Ex. The aim was to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> accessible version of the original game's systems while preserving its essentials. Original designer Harvey Smith directed the game, while Alexander Brandon and Sheldon Pacotti returned respectively as composer and scenario writer. Additional music and voice work {{was provided by the}} rock band Kidneythieves. Due to being developed for PC and Xbox, the game's environments needed to be designed with the console's hardware limitations in mind. In later interviews, members of the team have faulted their decisions for the title.|$|E
5|$|Either {{side of the}} Saloon are {{two smaller}} drawing rooms (8, 10), which would {{originally}} have served as private withdrawing rooms from the more public activities which would {{have taken place in}} the Marble Hall and Saloon. One of these rooms, now called the Tyrconnel Room (10), was transformed into the principal or state bedroom during the occupancy of Lord Tyrconnel in an attempt to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> fashionable suite of Baroque state rooms on the first floor. After his death in 1754, it became a Billiard Room, until the 3rd Earl Brownlow had it refurnished more than a century later. Unusually, the floor is painted with the family arms and crest. The date of the floor is not known for certain but the early nineteenth century has been suggested.|$|E
5|$|Forensics teams {{analyzed}} the DNA of Deer Island Jane to exclude some missing persons and {{in hopes of}} matching it to possible relatives of the girl whose DNA was on record. It was obtained through samples of hair and a tooth. The DNA did not match the profiles stored in databases of known missing persons. Officials stated that they also sent samples to the University of North Texas to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> specific profile, a time-consuming process. Mitochondrial DNA from {{the bones of the}} child was later developed to compare to possible relatives.|$|E

5|$|GTAW is most {{commonly}} used to weld thin sections of stainless steel and non-ferrous metals such as aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys. The process grants the operator greater control over the weld than competing processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding, allowing for stronger, higher quality welds. However, GTAW is comparatively more complex and difficult to master, and furthermore, it is significantly slower than most other welding techniques. A related process, plasma arc welding, uses a slightly different welding torch to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> focused welding arc {{and as a result}} is often automated.|$|E
5|$|Golem Arcana {{was funded}} through a Kickstarter {{campaign}} that launched in September 2013 {{and went on}} to raise over $500,000. The game was released just under a year later, on 13 August 2014. Both studio co-founder Jordan Weisman and executive producer Ray Winninger had extensive experience developing both video games and tabletop games, and one of their primary motivations in creating Golem Arcana was to merge the two gaming types. They also sought to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> social experience than could be found in traditional multiplayer video games.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to improving the}} economy, the lower social classes also had to {{be integrated into the}} new body politic, although they often got few rewards from independence. The political debate seeking answers to these questions was marked by a clash—at times on the battlefield—between liberalism and conservatism. Conservatives sought to maintain the traditional social structures in order to ensure stability; liberals sought to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> dynamic society and economy by ending ethnically-based social distinctions and freeing property from economic restrictions. In its quest to transform society, liberals often adopted policies that were not welcome by Native communities, who had benefited from unique protections afforded to them by traditional Spanish law.|$|E

Such predators or parasitoids can control pests not affected by the Bt protein. Reduced prey quality and abundance associated increased control from Bt cotton can also indirectly decrease natural enemy populations in some cases, but the percentage of pests eaten or parasitized in Bt and non-Bt cotton are often similar.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century German horticulturalists devoted many {{efforts to develop}} new Riesling hybrids that would <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> flexible, less temperamental grape that could still retain some of the elegant {{characteristics}} of Riesling. The most notable is the Müller-Thurgau developed in the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute in 1882, which is a cross of Riesling and Madeleine Royale (although long believed to be Riesling x Silvaner). Other Riesling/Silvaner crosses include the Palatinate regional favorite Scheurebe and Rieslaner. Kerner, a cross between Riesling and the red wine grape Trollinger is a high quality cross that has recently eclipsed Riesling in plantings.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{predecessor}} was Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6: Patriots, {{a tactical}} shooter announced in 2011. It had {{a focus on}} narrative, and the story campaign features many cut-scenes and scripted events. However, the game fell into a development hell shortly after its announcement. The game's outdated engine and frequent change of leadership hindered development progress, and game quality was not up to par. In addition, it was planned to be released on seventh-generation video-game consoles which were not capable of processing certain game mechanics. Seeing {{the arrival of a}} new generation of consoles, the team wanted to make use of this opportunity to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> technologically advanced game. As a result, Ubisoft decided to cancel Patriots, and assembled a new team of 25 people to come up with ideas to reboot the series.|$|E
