5|$|Because of the storm's {{death toll}} and damage, the name Chataan became retired and was {{replaced}} with Matmo in 2004. Countries in the World Meteorological Organization <b>can</b> <b>request</b> tropical cyclone names to be retired if a storm caused unusually heavy damage. With PAGASA, they retired the name Gloria {{and was replaced}} with Glenda in 2006; the agency sought to be apolitical after Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo won a disputed presidential election in 2004.|$|E

5|$|For example, {{when the}} FSM {{negotiated}} a defensive {{agreement with the}} United States, it did so from a weak position because it had grown heavily dependent on American assistance. Andorra has a small army, and <b>can</b> <b>request</b> defensive aid if necessary, while Iceland had a unique agreement with the United States that lasted until 2006, which required them to provide defense to Iceland when needed.|$|E

However, individual Commissioners, by request of the Council or Commission, can be compelled to retire on account of a breach of obligation(s) and if so ruled by the European Court of Justice (Art. 245 and 247, Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union).|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, the USB Promoters Group {{announced}} the finalization of the USB Power Delivery (PD) Specification (USB PD rev. 1), an extension that specifies using certified PD aware USB cables with standard USB Type-A and Type-B connectors to deliver increased power (more than 7.5W) to devices with larger power demand. Devices <b>can</b> <b>request</b> higher currents and supply voltages from compliant hosts up to 2A at 5V (for a power consumption {{of up to}} 10W), and optionally up to 3A or 5A at either 12V (36W or 60W) or 20V (60W or 100W). In all cases, both host-to-device and device-to-host configurations are supported.|$|E

5|$|The AH-64E Apache has {{the ability}} to control {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVs), used by the U.S. Army to perform aerial scouting missions previously performed by the OH-58 Kiowa. Apaches <b>can</b> <b>request</b> to take control of an RQ-7 Shadow or MQ-1C Grey Eagle from ground control stations to safely scout via datalink communications. There are four levels of UAV interoperability (LOI): LOI 1 indirectly receives payload data; LOI 2 receives payload data through direct communication; LOI 3 deploys the UAV's armaments; and LOI 4 takes over flight control. UAVs can search for enemies and, if equipped with a laser designator, target them for the Apache or other friendly aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Jadzia confides in Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) {{that she}} feels obligated to pursue Curzon's oath, but Kira warns her about what killing someone will do to her. Kang, likewise, tells Jadzia {{that she is not}} bound by Curzon's oath, but she insists on joining their quest. Kor, as buoyant as ever, is delighted to have her along. Koloth is dismissive, until she shows him her skills with a Klingon bat'leth. Kang refuses to accept her, until she shames him with his own devotion to Klingon honor, and insists that she have the chance to avenge her godson. Before Jadzia <b>can</b> <b>request</b> a leave of absence, Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) confronts her in her quarters, refusing her request before she can make it. Jadzia tells him that she is going and begs him not to make her disobey a direct order. He does not give her {{permission}} to go but does not stop her either.|$|E
5|$|The city {{government}} {{is involved in}} the economic development process, helping firms grow and attracting new firms. A portion of sales tax revenues is set aside for this, some going into the Grand Forks Growth Fund. Companies <b>can</b> <b>request</b> low-interest loans or grants from this fund provided they meet certain criteria, such as paying a relatively high wage and doing most of their business outside the city's trade region. The city also contributes to the Grand Forks Region Economic Development Corporation (EDC), a public-private organization that receives funding from banks and other major businesses. The EDC plays a consulting role for businesses, such as identifying suitable sites for expansion or assembling public funding packages. Its other key role is to vet businesses to see if they are suitable for funding by the Growth Fund.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the current}} process, when the NPB team notifies the MLB Commissioner of a posting, it also sets the posting fee, {{which is now}} capped at a maximum of $20million. Once the MLB Commissioner announces the posting and the fee, the player has 30days to sign with an MLB team. Unlike the past system, in which only the team that won the bidding process had {{negotiating}} rights, the current system allows the posted player to negotiate with any MLB team {{willing to pay the}} posting fee. As in the previous process, if the player signs with an MLB team during the negotiating window, the signing team will pay the posting fee; otherwise, his rights revert to his NPB team. Also mirroring the past system, an unsuccessfully posted player <b>can</b> <b>request</b> a posting in a later year, with the process repeated.|$|E
