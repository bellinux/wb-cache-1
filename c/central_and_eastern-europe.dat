40|$|Shopping-trolleys being available, {{in working}} order {{and ready to}} use are the three decisive {{characteristics}} of successful shopping-trolley-management and accordingly concern the functional areas procurement, maintenance, cleaning (and ultimately disposal). This bachelor-thesis has been written in cooperation with Kaufland and describes the processes and costs of the shopping-trolley-management of Kaufland in the above named areas. Kaufland is a trading firm, which has been founded in Germany, has business operations in Central- <b>and</b> <b>Eastern-Europe</b> <b>and</b> is known especially for its self-service-stores named „Kaufland“. In these stores, with a retail area between 2000 - 12. 000 m², customers can choose from a product range of up to 60. 000 goods of the food- and non-food-area. The strategic coordination of the shopping-trolley-management {{is located in the}} department Branch-Equipment of the functional area Procurement International, which is responsible for product development, purchasing and standardization of the objects used to equip a store. The thesis is divided into two parts: At first the processes and costs of the shopping-trolley-management of Kaufland in Germany and in the KMO-countries (Kaufland Central- <b>and</b> <b>Eastern-Europe)</b> are presented. To record the processes and costs, face-to-face- and telephone-interviews were conducted and data were gathered in inquiry forms by mail. The results can be reviewed in written process descriptions and the completed inquiry forms. This section of the thesis is based on the theories of life-cycle-costing and concludes with a presentation of the „Best Practices“ of processes and the calculation of the life-cycle-costs of the Kaufland shopping-trolley-stock. The life-cycle-costs are calculated in the form of nominal- and present-values (discounted-values) taking into account the most important life cycle phases (procurement, maintenance, cleaning and disposal). Next a leasing- and service-offer for the Kaufland shopping-trolley-stock, created by the Wanzl Metallwarenfabrik GmbH in cooperation with the Deutschen Leasing, is presented. The leasing part is viewed {{as an alternative to the}} current way of procuring shopping-trolleys, the service part is compared with the current service-processes and -costs of the shopping-trolleys. This section of the thesis is based on the leasing-, procurement-theory and economic efficiency calculations and concludes with an assessment of the given offer as well as a compilation and assessment of possible leasing-contract-alternatives. The used and given information originate from the literature reviewed, face-to-face- and telephone-interviews with the contact persons at the Wanzl Metallwarenfabrik GmbH and the Deutschen Leasing. The results show that the given leasing- and service-offer is not connected to process improvements and cost savings by Kaufland and should not be accepted, however the application of the described „Best Practices“ in all countries as well as the development of a new, flexible leasing-offer, taking into account the information about processes and costs obtained in this thesis, might very well be economically favorable...|$|R
40|$|Out of the {{attempts}} made at modernising the Hungarian society and {{economy in the}} era of socialism it was only the agricultural transition and development that has brought a long, internationally recognised success. The Hungarian agricultural model has become a point of reference for numerous developing countries, and was widely recognised even in the developed world. The aim {{of this article is to}} analyse the driving forces and socio-economic environment in the formation of the Hungarian agricultural model as well as its results, object lessons and experiences. The authors emphasise the specific aspects of the Hungarian agricultural development, contrasting it with that of Western- <b>and</b> <b>Eastern-Europe.</b> It was underlined, that the most important drivers of modernisation were (1) the courage of searching new answers to the problems of agricultural modernisation, abandoning the Soviet models and the methods of economic direction and policy; (2) a system-based, integrated approach of the agricultural policy; (3) using numerous elements of the market economies as well as the decentralisation of decision-making; (4) applying material incentives in a wide range; (5) the extensive application of the results of science and development. agricultural policy, economic history, system analysis, Agricultural and Food Policy, Political Economy, Production Economics,...|$|R
40|$|This paper quantifies {{the extent}} of {{preferential}} trade {{as a share of}} total world trade in different regions of the world and for two periods. Results show that: i) preferential trade represented 40 % of world trade in the period 1988 - 1992 and it slightly increased to 42 % during the period 1993 - 1997; ii) during the second period, agricultural products generally benefited more from the existence of preferential trade agreements than industrial products (maybe due to GATT-exemption); iii) the regional distribution of preferential trade is relatively uneven with a significant share of preferential trade in Western Europe (around 70 per cent), relatively low values in the Western Hemisphere (around 25 per cent), very low shares in Asia and Oceania (around 4 per cent) and average values in the rest-of-the-world (Eastern Europe and Africa); iv) the largest increase in shares of preferential trade between the two periods has occurred in the Western Hemisphere <b>and</b> in <b>Eastern-Europe</b> <b>and</b> Africa; v) at the country level there is an inverted-u-shape relationship between the share of preferential trade and the size and GDP per capita of individual countries; vi) countries which are highly open to trade tend to have a larger share of preferential trade on total trade in the period 1993 - 1997, suggesting that preferential and non-preferential trade can be seen as complements...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the age of}} enlightenment, state constructions {{pay tribute}} to the values the (new) {{political}} regime wants to highlight. Next to the solemn preamble that positions the state in general, mostly historical terms, a particular section of the Constitution is devoted to a more detailed enumeration of rights and freedoms, reflecting the quintessence of the political system. Given the legally binding nature of constitutional texts, comments mainly originated from the lawyers' side. Ethical-theological reflections hardly interfere at this level, since the principles of Western liberal democracies are deemed to be of a political nature and, moreover, are in most cases generally accepted. The discussion starts when those rights, e. g. on a qualitative life, on the freedom of expression or on social integration, have to be applied in operational terms. Until recently, the EU was only indirectly involved in these debates, since it focused its attention on market integration and international trade issues. The Treaty on European Union (1992), however, triggered by the radical regime change in Central- <b>and</b> <b>Eastern-Europe,</b> has initiated a novel process of self-definition, ending up in a quasi-constitutional set of values and principles to be integrated in the Reform Treaty (2007). Although these principles are shared by all member states, their innovative formulation is primarily taking place at the EU level. Moreover, they are not only perceived as potential political-legal guidelines, but as a system of values. The first and crucial condition for joining the EU, indeed, is the respect for its values and the commitment to promoting them together (Constitutional Treaty, art. 1. 2). Whatever the outcome may be of the negotiation of a revised Constitutional Treaty, {{it is clear that the}} EU has developed into a Community of Values, some of them being formulated in much more operational terms than the traditional constitutions mentioned above. status: publishe...|$|R
