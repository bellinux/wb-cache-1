On January 3, 1983, Universal then sent cease-and-desist letters to Nintendo's licensees offering three options: stop using Donkey Kong characters, obtain a license from Universal, or be sued. Six licensees <b>caved,</b> but Milton Bradley refused to do so. When Ralston Purina's offer of $5,000 {{for the use of}} Donkey Kong characters on breakfast cereal was turned down, they also refused to settle.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} that struck the Azorean islands was a magnitude 7.2 on the Richter scale. It caused considerable damage on three separate islands (Terceira, São Jorge, and Graciosa), destroying several buildings. According to local reports, roughly 70% {{of the houses}} on Terceira were completely demolished, including the historic quarter of the island capital, Angra do Heroísmo.

5|$|Despite the support, {{the state}} <b>caved</b> {{to some of}} the {{complaints}} of the opposition, resulting in a delay of the project. By November1963, the state told Caroline officials that the design of bridges along NY330 required changing to new state highway standards. The state began working also on assessing property values of the land required for the new position. They stated that unless the state budget could not afford it, the project would begin the process in 1964. Patience ran thin by February1964 with the Caroline town officials, who demanded progress from the state, who stated that the project could not move forward until there was funding. By November1964, the state admitted nothing would happen until at least 1965, two years behind schedule. This time, the construction would be delayed due to delays in acquiring land and personnel.|$|E

5|$|Harper {{was appalled}} when Britain made India {{independent}} in 1947—he {{held that the}} British government had unnecessarily <b>caved</b> in to Indian nationalist demands and should have continued in the subcontinent indefinitely. He retained this view for years afterwards. He retired from the RAF in April 1949 with the rank of wing commander, and the same year emigrated to Southern Rhodesia, a British colony in southern Africa that had been self-governing since 1923. He settled in the central town of Gatooma, where he farmed, mined and set up an earth-moving contractor's business. In 1953, Southern Rhodesia became a territory of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland alongside Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Each territory retained its own political status and government, and Southern Rhodesia's constitutional status was unaltered.|$|E
5|$|It {{took four}} years until they reunited, {{when she and}} Agrippa came to Rome in 75. The reasons for this long absence are unclear, but {{have been linked to}} {{possible}} opposition to her presence by Gaius Licinius Mucianus, a political ally of emperor Vespasian who died sometime between 72 and 78. Agrippa was given the rank of praetor, while Berenice resumed her relationship with Titus, living with him at the palace and reportedly acting in every respect as his wife. The ancient historian Cassius Dio writes that Berenice was at the height of her power during this time, and if it can be any indication as to how influential she was, Quintilian records an anecdote in his Institutio Oratoria where, to his astonishment, he found himself pleading a case on Berenice's behalf where she herself presided as the judge. The Roman populace however perceived the Eastern Queen as an intrusive outsider, and when the pair was publicly denounced by Cynics in the theatre, Titus <b>caved</b> in to the pressure and sent her away.|$|E

Amid a microburst, a waterspout tore roofs off buildings and hospitalized five residents in Westmoreland Parish's capital of Savanna-la-Mar, while to the northwest, strong gusts and rough surf impacted the resort town of Negril. In the wake of the storm, a body was recovered from debris along a road in Saint Catherine. Flooded streets, roads and bridges isolated communities across seven of the island's parishes and trapped hundreds of residents in their homes.|$|E

5|$|Vainio's friends Heikki Kauppinen and Reijo Tani quit {{drinking}} in 1972, {{and at first}} Vainio found their decision odd. When Vexi Salmi was hired by Fazer in 1970, Vainio and Salmi started drinking together often and sometimes even came to work with hangovers. On one occasion, Vainio forgot that {{he was supposed to}} have finished the text of an advertising tune. When the deadline arrived, Vainio was too hung over to finish the lyrics and eventually Salmi agreed to help by writing the lyrics for Vainio's composition. Vainio's alcohol use increased in the 1970s, and his parents watched without being able to do anything about it. It is reported that Vainio would not go to sleep at night unless he had liquor under his bed, and he always kept a bottle with him. Vainio began to realize that he could not live like this forever. By summer 1975 he decided that he needed to stop drinking altogether. He was especially helped in this decision through his meeting footballer Kai Pahlman, who told Vainio that he was surprised he was still alive. In late 1975, Vainio stayed sober for four months, but then <b>caved</b> in for a short time. In January 1976 he finally managed to {{quit drinking}} for good.|$|E
