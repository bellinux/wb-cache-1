40|$|International audienceSignalling {{molecules}} integrate, codify {{and transport}} information in cells. Organisation of these molecules in <b>complexes</b> <b>and</b> clusters improves the efficiency, fidelity and robustness of cellular signalling. Here, we summarise current views on how signalling molecules assemble into macromolecular <b>complexes</b> <b>and</b> clusters {{and how they}} use their physical properties to transduce environmental information {{into a variety of}} cellular processes. In addition, we discuss recent innovations in live-cell imaging at the sub-micrometer scale and the challenges of object (particle) tracking, both of which help us to observe signalling <b>complexes</b> <b>and</b> clusters and to examine their dynamic character...|$|R

Here we report that CESA interactive protein 1 (CSI 1) is a microtubule-associated protein that bridges CESA <b>complexes</b> <b>and</b> cortical microtubules. Simultaneous in vivo imaging of CSI 1, CESA <b>complexes,</b> <b>and</b> microtubules demonstrates that the association of CESA <b>complexes</b> <b>and</b> cortical microtubules is dependent on CSI 1.
