40|$|We {{present a}} map of the diffuse {{ultraviolet}} cosmic background in two wavelength bands (FUV: 1530 Å and NUV: 2310 Å) over almost 75 % of the sky using archival data from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) mission. Most of the diffuse flux is due to dust-scattered starlight and follows a <b>cosecant</b> <b>law</b> with slopes of 545 photons cm− 2 s− 1 sr− 1 Å− 1 and 433 photons cm− 2 s− 1 sr− 1 Å− 1 in the FUV and NUV bands, respectively. There is a strong correlation with the 100 μm Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) flux with an average UV/IR ratio of 300 photons cm− 2 s− 1 sr− 1 Å− 1 (MJy sr− 1) − 1 in the FUV band and that of 220 photons cm− 2 s− 1 sr− 1 Å− 1 (MJy sr− 1) − 1 in the NUV band but with significant variations over the sky. In addition to the large-scale distribution of the diffuse light, we note a number of individual features including bright spots around the hot stars Spica and Achernar.
