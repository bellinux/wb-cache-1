40|$|Saskatchewan Highways and Transportation (SHT) is {{responsible}} for 26, 125 km of highways in the province. The highway system is divided into primary and secondary highways. The primary highway system provides an inter-regional, inter-provincial, and inter-national highway network that was built to accommodate traffic volumes in excess of 4, 000 vehicles per day with significant numbers of heavily loaded trucks. The secondary highway system consists of structural, thin membrane surface (TMS), and gravel highways. TMS highways were constructed to provide feeder links into the primary system for relatively low volumes of traffic with few heavily loaded trucks. Years of increasing volumes of heavy trucks and inadequate funding on the TMS highway system have forced SHT to evaluate various management strategies. New maintenance and management strategies like partnerships with Rural Municipalities and full depth in-place <b>chemical</b> <b>strengthening</b> have been developed and, along with conventional management strategies, are being used throughout Saskatchewan. 	 The purpose {{of this research is}} to develop a project level analytical framework capable of evaluating management strategies for secondary highways, based on SHT surfacing and structure standards.

40|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>strengthening</b> via ion exchange, thermal tempering, and {{lamination}} {{are proven}} techniques for strengthening of oxide glasses. For {{each of these}} techniques, the strengthening mechanism is conventionally ascribed to the linear superposition of the compressive stress profile on the glass surface. However, in this work we use molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the underlying indentation deformation mechanism beyond the simple linear superposition of compressive and indentation stresses. In particular, the plastic zone can be dramatically different from the commonly assumed hemispherical shape, {{which leads to a}} completely different stress field and resulting crack system. We show that the indentation-induced fracture is controlled by two competing mechanisms: the compressive stress itself and a potential reduction in free volume that can increase the driving force for crack formation. <b>Chemical</b> <b>strengthening</b> via ion exchange tends to escalate the competition between these two effects, while thermal tempering tends to reduce it. Lamination of glasses with differential thermal expansion falls in between. The crack system also depends on the indenter geometry and the loading stage, i. e., loading vs. after unloading. It is observed that combining thermal tempering or high free volume content with ion exchange or lamination can impart a relatively high compressive stress and reduce the driving force for crack formation. Therefore, such a combined approach might offer the best overall crack resistance for oxide glasses...|$|E

40|$|Flexible {{electronics}} and displays rely on strong thin borosilicate glasses. Furthermore, borosilicate glass {{play a vital}} role in pharmaceutical packaging, particularly for the container of liquid medicine in the auto-injectors. Because of the risk of failure due to the fracture of the glass ampule the costumers need to purchase several units of auto-injector; also, the injector price increases dramatically. This renewed the interest in the strengthening of soda-borosilicate glass. Moreover, the applications of strong thin borosilicate glasses in flexible electronics attracted attention. <b>Chemical</b> <b>strengthening</b> is a practical means of improving the mechanical performance of soda borosilicate glasses. The <b>chemical</b> <b>strengthening</b> process involves the immersion of an alkali-silicate glass in a molten nitrate salt containing potassium ions at temperatures below the glass-transition temperature where the replacement of small alkali ions in the glass with larger potassium ions from the molten salt occurs. The glass composition, salts impurities, temperature and time, are crucial factors of the treatment. Furthermore, applying an electric field can speed up the process and improves the efficiency. This study investigates the impact of potassium for sodium ion exchange and its parameters on the final strength of alkali borosilicate glasses. Alkali borosilicate tubes, used in pharmaceutical packaging, were subjected to ion exchange in potassium nitrate salts containing different impurities. The initial surface flaws have a significant impact on the final strength due to the limited case depth of surface compression in alklai borosilicate glass subjected to ion exchange. Nonetheless, the results revealed that the sodium poisoning of salt has a limited influence on strengthening; conversely, even a small amount of calcium spoils the strengthening. The replacement of sodium ions with calcium is thermodynamically favoured with respect to Na/K ion-exchange. Calcium can penetrate into the glass surface and prevent the replacement of sodium with potassium and, consequently, the generation of compressive stress. Interestingly, performing electric field assisted ion exchange, EF-IE, for 10 min produces an ion-exchanged layer as deep as conventional strengthening for 4 hours in soda borosilicate glass. Electric field assisted ion exchange also augments the glass strength and makes the glass more damage resistant; however, the initial defects on the glass surface have an adverse influence on the efficiency, as expected. Applying an electric field changes the governing mechanism of ion exchange and accelerates the penetration of potassium ions into the glass; furthermore, the glass structure of the layer undergone electric field assisted ion exchange is modified during the process. Although EF-IE generates a strong surface compression in glass, the inhomogeneous distribution of residual stress is a drawback. Performing EF-IE using AC E-fields produces homogenous ion-exchanged layers in glass and is, probably, a practical approach to balancing the residual stress in glass. <b>Chemical</b> <b>strengthening</b> of a thin alkali-borosilicate glass,D 263 Teco®, is also investigated in the present work. Na/K ion exchange improves the glass strength three times. Although the surface compression generated by ion-exchange in alkali borosilicate glasses is not as strong as typically used glasses for <b>chemical</b> <b>strengthening</b> (alklai aluminosilicate), it can be used to improve the mechanical properties of borosilicate glass. Annealing prior to the ion exchange increases the compressive stress generated on the surface; however, its effect on strengthening is trivial. The compressive stress produced by Na/K ion exchange in thin alkali borosilicate glass improves the damage resistance and the bending strength of glass. Due to the limited thickness of samples, heat treatments with high heating and cooling rates can be conducted. Such heat treatments can be used to carry out surface relaxation and improve the strength of samples by “surface relaxation”. A fast heat treatment after ion exchange improves the finals strength samples about 40...|$|E

As {{one of the main}} genera of rust fungi with economic and biological importance, Puccinia infects almost all cereals but is unable to cause diseases on legumes. Little is known about the mechanism of this kind of effective defense in legumes to these non-host pathogens. Results In this study, the basis of NHR in broad bean (Vicia faba L.) against the wheat stripe rust pathogen, Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), was characterized. No visible symptoms were observed on broad bean leaves inoculated with Pst. Microscopic observations showed that successful location of stomata and haustoria formation were significantly reduced in Pst infection of broad bean. Attempted infection induced the formation of papillae, cell wall thickening, production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition and accumulation of phenolic compounds in plant cell walls. The few Pst haustoria that did form in broad bean cells were encased in reactive oxygen and callose materials and those cells elicited cell death. Furthermore, a total of seven defense-related genes were identified and found to be up-regulated during the Pst infection. Conclusions The results indicate that NHR in broad bean against Pst results from a continuum of layered defenses, including basic incompatibility, structural and <b>chemical</b> <b>strengthening</b> of cell wall, posthaustorial hypersensitive response and induction of several defense-related genes, demonstrating the multi-layered feature of NHR.
