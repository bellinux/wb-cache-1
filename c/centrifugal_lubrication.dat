40|$|From an {{environmental}} point of view, a MQL (Minimum Quantity Lubrication) method should be adopted to gear transmission systems. This study aims {{to find a}} reliable MQL method and a design method for gears operated under high-speed driving conditions. The conclusions are as follows. First, the application of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>lubrication</b> method is able {{to pull out the}} full cooling performance of the lubricant. Second, the operation of gears with 30 % specific sliding shows less heat generation than that of gears with 50 % specific sliding. Third, combining the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>lubrication</b> method and the gears with 30 % specific sliding is effective for reducing {{an environmental}} load of gear transmission systems...|$|E
50|$|The vehicle's {{engine is}} {{completely}} new, a 5.9-liter flat-plane V8, {{but this time}} with two <b>centrifugal</b> superchargers. Engine <b>lubrication</b> is a dry-sump with piston spray oil cooling. Power {{is expected to be}} at around 1100 hp. The top speed is also expected to be at around the 233 mph (375 km/h) mark originally achieved by the ST1.|$|R
