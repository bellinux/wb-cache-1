40|$|The {{traditional}} {{model of}} the electromagnetic force and torque does not take the coil corners into account, which is the major cause for the motor fluctuation. To reduce the fluctuation, a more accurate real-time computation model, which considers {{the influence of the}} coil corners, is proposed in this paper. Three coordinate systems respectively for the stator, the mover, and the corner are established. The first harmonic of the magnetic flux density distribution of a Halbach magnet array is taken into account in this model. The coil is divided into the straight <b>coil</b> <b>segment</b> and the corner <b>coil</b> <b>segment</b> based on its structure.

Proteins are built from α-helices and/or β-strands interconnected by these <b>coil</b> <b>segments.</b> Here, we investigate the conformational determinants of short <b>coil</b> <b>segments,</b> with particular emphasis on chain turns. Toward this goal, we extracted a comprehensive set of two-, three-, and four-residue turns from X-ray–elucidated proteins and classified them by conformation. A remarkably small number of unique conformers account for most of this experimentally determined set, whereas remaining members span a large number of rare conformers, many occurring only once in the entire protein database. Factors determining conformation were identified via Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations devised to test the effectiveness of various energy terms. Simulated structures were validated by comparison to experimental counterparts. After filtering rare conformers, we found that 98 % of the remaining experimentally determined turn population could be reproduced by applying a hydrogen bond energy term to an exhaustively generated ensemble of clash-free conformers in which no backbone polar group lacks a hydrogen-bond partner. Further, at least 90 % of longer <b>coil</b> <b>segments,</b> ranging from 5 - to 20 residues, were found to be structural composites of these shorter primitives. These results are pertinent to protein structure prediction, where approaches can be divided into either empirical or ab initio methods.

40|$|Abstract Background Predicting the {{three-dimensional}} {{structure of a}} protein from its amino acid sequence is currently {{one of the most}} challenging problems in bioinformatics. The internal structure of helices and sheets is highly recurrent and help reduce the search space significantly. However, random <b>coil</b> <b>segments</b> make up nearly 40 % of proteins and they do not have any apparent recurrent patterns, which complicates overall prediction accuracy of protein structure prediction methods. Luckily, previous work has indicated that <b>coil</b> <b>segments</b> are in fact not completely random in structure and flanking residues do seem to have a significant influence on the dihedral angles adopted by the individual amino acids in <b>coil</b> <b>segments.</b> In this work we attempt to predict a probability distribution of these dihedral angles based on the flanking residues. While attempts to predict dihedral angles of <b>coil</b> <b>segments</b> have been done previously, none have, to our knowledge, presented comparable results for the probability distribution of dihedral angles. Results In this paper we develop an artificial neural network that uses an input-window of amino acids to predict a dihedral angle probability distribution for the middle residue in the input-window. The trained neural network shows a significant improvement (4 - 68 %) in predicting the most probable bin (covering a 30 ° × 30 ° area of the dihedral angle space) for all amino acids in the data set compared to baseline statistics. An accuracy comparable to that of secondary structure prediction (≈ 80 %) is achieved by observing the 20 bins with highest output values. Conclusion Many different protein structure prediction methods exist and each uses different tools and auxiliary predictions to help determine the native structure. In this work the sequence is used to predict local context dependent dihedral angle propensities in coil-regions. This predicted distribution can potentially improve tertiary structure prediction methods that are based on sampling the backbone dihedral angles of individual amino acids. The predicted distribution may also help predict local structure fragments used in fragment assembly methods. </p...|$|R
40|$|Transcription {{elongation}} {{is regulated}} by the cellular protein Hexim 1, which inhibits phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II by interacting with the positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb. Hexim 1 binds directly to Cyclin T 1 of P-TEFb with its coiled coil domain that is subdivided into a highly polar N-terminal segment containing nonconservative residues in the dimer interface and a C-terminal segment with an evolutionarily conserved sequence composition. Here we show that the noncanonical sequence composition of the first <b>coiled</b> <b>coil</b> <b>segment</b> {{is required for the}} interaction with Cyclin T 1 while the second segment keeps the Cyclin T-binding domain dimeric upon binding. Both <b>coiled</b> <b>coil</b> <b>segments</b> exhibit distinct melting points as shown by heat denaturation experiments using circular dichroism spectroscopy. Deletion of the central stammer motif (Delta 316 - 318) leads to a single denaturation reaction, suggesting formation of a continuous coiled coil. Mutation of noncanonical coiled coil residues K 284 and Y 291 to valines in the dimer interface of the first segment only slightly increases its stability. Concomitantly, deletion of the stammer but not the double point mutation led to a reduced affinity for Cyclin T 1 as shown by isothermal titration calorimetry. Moreover, Cyclin T 1 bound Hexim 1 with a 1 : 2 stoichiometry, whereas truncation of the C-terminal coiled coil led to formation of an equimolar complex. These observations suggest that binding to Cyclin T 1 induces an asymmetry or sterical hindrance in the first <b>coiled</b> <b>coil</b> <b>segment</b> of dimeric Hexim 1 that disallows formation of a 2 : 2 complex as further supported by analytical ultracentrifugation and cross-linking experiments...|$|R

Two regions surrounded by aromatic residues (F 49, Y 60, F 96, Y 91 and Y 31, H 68, Y 65, F 78) have been localized on the protein surface, and a role for sugar binding is suggested. The epitope mapping of CtD-Ole e 9 shows that B-cell epitopes are mainly located on loops, although {{some of them are}} contained in secondary structural elements. Interestingly, the IgG and IgE epitopes are contiguous or overlapped, rather than coincident. The three-dimensional structure of CtD-Ole e 9 might help to understand the underlying mechanism of its biochemical function and to determine possible structure–allergenicity relationships...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] -Ignitor {{has been}} the first {{experiment}} proposed and designed to reach ignition conditions in magnetically confined plasmas. It is a compact,high field machine based on the physics developed primarily by the Alcator series of experiments. Each refinement of IGNITOR has drawn from {{a common set of}} "tools": Bitter plate copper magnets; bucking/wedging interactions of the CS and TF coils; and passive and active preload mechanisms to offset vertical tension in the inner leg and tension in the horizontal leg. Elements of the IGNITOR design are statically indetterminant. Examples of multiply redundant load paths used in other reactor designs are cited. Despite a large body of historical work confirming the structural feasibility of IGNITOR, it still is erroneously perceived as more challenging than other tokamak designs. Past US analyses are recalled: US contributions from independently derived models are described and are compared with the latest IGNITOR project analyses. Differences in modeling philosophy are presented, and results are compared. Recent US analyses employ non-linear path dependent friction of a 2 <b>coil</b> <b>segment.</b> Sensitivity studies of fit-up tolerances and, uncertainties in material properties are presented. While there are some small differences in results, these analyses independently confirm the benefits of the major structural elements used in IGNITOR. I...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{characterize}} and evaluate seven models of turbulent flow nonself - compensating drippers {{available in the}} Brazilian market. The characterization of the emitters followed the pro- cedures of the standards NBR ISO 9261. The experiment was conducted at UNESP University Estadual Pau- lista, Botucatu Campus, Department of Rural Engineering. For {{the execution of the}} test one randomly took from each <b>coil,</b> <b>segments</b> containing 25 emitters. In the evaluation of hydraulic and technical characteristics of emitters were determined the following parameters: coefficient of manufacturing variation, coefficients of the characteristic equation of the emitter, thickness of the tube wall, internal diameter, spacing between emitters, water pressure resistance at ambient temperature and 40 o C, the tensile strength of the tube with a tension of 160 N and 180 N, and premature aging testing. The analysis of the drip tapes showed a coefficient of manufac- turing variation of less than 0. 056 for all emitters. The exponents (m) of the equation pressure versus flow rate ranged from 0. 431 to 0. 575, classifying them as nonself - compensating. About the wall thickness, the internal diameter of the drip tapes and the spacing between emitters were found out that all measured values are within the required standard. From the results obtained, it can be stated that all products tested and available in the Brazilian market showed satisfactory performance and quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamical}} {{requirements for}} protein thermostability are {{a subject of}} intense debate since different techniques are sensitive to different dynamical processes. The present investigation arises from a neutron scattering experiment pointing to the lower temperature dependence of the flexibility of thermophilic proteins as a mechanism of enhanced thermostability. By means of 200 ns molecular dynamics simulations at different temperatures, we have investigated the differences in internal dynamics of the thermo-mesophilic pair of proteins studied in the experiment. The present work exceeds the time scales explored by the experiment and former studies on other thermo-mesophilic pairs by several orders of magnitude. Our simulations confirm the different thermal behavior observed in the experiment and suggest that both reduced <b>coil</b> <b>segments</b> and salt bridge interactions contribute to lowering the increase in flexibility with temperature. Moreover, the mesophilic protein exhibits a more heterogeneous distribution of residue mobilities involving more local motions. We suggest that the more collective motions of the thermophilic protein underlie a broader energy landscape. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

40|$|Abstract — Tensile strain, {{normal to}} the surface of {{insulation}} layers, is an issue {{in the design of the}} ITER central solenoid (CS). There are a number of sources of through thickness insulation tension. Tensions develop from flexure of the conductor jacket under axial self loads. Tensions develop from quench behavior. Global components of tensile stress result from normal interactions between the <b>segmented</b> <b>coils.</b> Global simulations of the <b>segmented</b> <b>coil</b> system are presented with parametric studies of frictional behavior and degree of axial preload. With lower preload, and appropriate modeling of slippage and separation, the global tensile stresses can be kept below 4 MPa. A design preload value of 10 MPa is recommended. Radial tensions due to normal operation vertical (axial) stresses are above 50 MPa. Quench tensile stresses are above 20 MPa. These are not altered by adjustments in preload. Designing fo...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlthough group B Neisseria meningitidis is {{responsible}} for {{a significant amount of}} meningococcal meningitis, its capsular polysaccharide is precluded from the current vaccine because of its poor immunogenicity. This phenomenon is attributable to structural mimicry between the group B meningococcal polysaccharide (GBMP) and human tissue antigens. One simple way to avoid this problem is to use as a vaccine a synthetic N-propionylated (NPr) form of the GBMP, which when conjugated to tetanus toxoid (IT, induces, in mice, high titers of bactericidal antibodies against all group B meningococci. Fortuitously, the major population of NPr GBMP-specific antibodies, even though not cross-reactive with the GBMP, contains all the protective activity. Only a minor population of GBMP cross-reactive antibodies are produced, but even the level of these antibodies can be significantly reduced by adjuvant manipulation. Thus the NPr GBMP mimics a highly conserved capsule-associated epitope that could be the basis of a potential vaccine against group B meningitis. To further define this protective epitope, a series of GBMP-specific monoclonal antibodies of the IgG isotype were produced using an (NeuPr) ≈ 35 − 35 TT conjugate vaccine. Unlike GBMP-specific antibodies, which recognize epitopes found only on the extended helical form, some of those secreted by the NPr GBMP-specific clones were also able to recognize short (random <b>coil)</b> <b>segments</b> of the NPr GBMP However, only those antibodies specific for the extended helical epitopes were protective as defined by bactericidal assays or passive protection experiments...|$|R
