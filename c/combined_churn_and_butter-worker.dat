40|$|In {{the last}} decades, mobile phones {{have become the}} major medium for {{communication}} between humans. The site effect {{is the loss of}} subscribers. Consequently, Telecoms operators invest in developing algorithms for quantifying the risk to <b>churn</b> <b>and</b> to influence other subscribers to churn. The objective is to prioritize the retention of subscribers in their network due to the cost of obtaining a new subscriber is four times more expensive than retaining subscribers. Hence, we use Extremely Random Forest to classify churners and non-churners obtaining a Lift value at 10 % of 5. 5. Then, we rely on graph-based measures such as Degree of Centrality and Page rank to measure emitted and received influence in the social network of the carrier. Our methodology allows summarising churn risk score, relying on a Fuzzy Logic system, <b>combining</b> the <b>churn</b> probability <b>and</b> the risk of the churner to leave the network with other subscriber...|$|R

40|$|The {{relevance}} of operations research cannot be overemphasized, as {{it provides the}} best possible results in any given circumstance, through analysis of operations {{and the use of}} scientific method thus, this paper explore the combination of two operations research models (analytic hierarchy process and Markov chain) for solving subscribers’ <b>churn</b> <b>and</b> retention problem peculiar to most service firms. A conceptual model for unraveling the problem customer <b>churn</b> <b>and</b> retention decision management was proposed and tested with data on third level analysis of AHP for determining appropriate strategies for customer <b>churn</b> <b>and</b> retention in the Nigeria telecommunication industries. A survey was conducted with 408 subscribers; the sample for the study was selected through multi-stage sampling. Two analytical tools were proposed for the analysis of data. These include: Expert Choice/Excel Solver (using Microsoft Excel) and Windows based Quantitative System for Business (WinQSB). This paper plays important role in understanding various strategies for effective <b>churn</b> <b>and</b> retention management and the ranking of <b>churn</b> <b>and</b> retention drivers in order of importance to stakeholders` decision-making. The study provided a framework for understanding the application of AHP and Markov chain for modeling, analysing and proffering solution to problem of <b>churn</b> <b>and</b> retention. The study recommends organizational strategies (corporate, business and functional) that reverse the churn alternatives with high priority and equally strengthen service delivery on high priority retention alternatives in order to ensure firms sustainable competitive advantage...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} <b>churning</b> indicators- turnover <b>and</b> cost-to-equity ratios- are {{crude and}} poorly {{suited to the}} task because they can fail to detect obvious cases of <b>churning,</b> <b>and</b> erroneously signal <b>churning</b> in cases where none occurred. Moreover, traditional measures of damages in churning cases, particularly trading costs and benchmark portfolio measures, often give rise to inconsistent damage estimates. These failures and inconsistencies can be largely resolved through careful application of financial economics. This note improves upon traditional indicators of <b>churning</b> <b>and</b> demonstrates that, properly calculated, the trading costs estimate of damages closely parallels the well-managed theory, or benchmark portfolio, estimate of damages...|$|R

40|$|Service <b>churn</b> <b>and</b> {{retention}} rates remain central as constructs {{in marketing}} {{activities such as}} valuation of service subscribers and resource allocation. While extant approaches have been proposed to relate service churn to external factors such as reported satisfaction, marketing mix activities, and the like, managers often face situations in which the only information available is the duration for which subscribers have had service. In such cases, can they forecast service <b>churn</b> <b>and</b> understand the contributing factors, which may allow for subsequent intervention? The authors propose a framework to examine factors that may underlie service retention in a contractual setting. Specifically, they utilize a model of retention that takes into account: (1) duration dependence, (2) promotional effects, (3) subscriber heterogeneity, (4) cross-cohort effects, and (5) calendar-time effects (e. g., seasonality). The framework is then applied to subscription databases of seven services offered by a telecommunications provider, mirroring the format commonly used to forecast future service <b>churn</b> (<b>and</b> to make managerial decisions). Across all seven services, the inclusion of promotional effects always improves the forecast accuracy of retention behavior, while including cross-cohort effects does no...|$|R

40|$|Linked employer-employee {{data from}} Finnish {{business}} sector {{is used in}} analysing worker turnover. The data set is an unbalanced panel with over 219 000 observations in 1991 - 97. The churning (excess worker turnover), worker inflow, and worker outflow rates are explained by plant and employee characteristics. The probabilities of observing non-zero <b>churning,</b> inflow, <b>and</b> outflow rates increase with plant size. The magnitudes of the non-zero <b>churning</b> <b>and</b> inflow rates depend positively on size, but the magnitude of outflow rate depends negatively on size. High-wage plants have low turnover; plants with large within-plant variation in wages have high turnover. Average tenure of employees has {{a negative impact on}} turnover. High plant employment growth increases <b>churning</b> <b>and</b> separation but reduces hiring in the next year. Also controlled are average age and education of employees, shares of women and homeowners among employees, foreign ownership, ownership changes, and regional unemployment. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{open source}} {{application}} JabRef has existed since 2003. In 2015, the developers {{decided to make}} an architectural refactoring as continued development was deemed too demanding. The developers also introduced Static Architecture Conformance Checking (SACC) to prevent violations to the intended architecture. Measurements mined from source code repositories such as code <b>churn</b> <b>and</b> code ownership {{has been linked to}} several problems, for example fault proneness, security vulnerabilities, code smells, and degraded maintainability. The root cause of such problems can be architectural. To determine the impact of the refactoring of JabRef, we measure the code <b>churn</b> <b>and</b> code ownership before and after the refactoring and find that large files with violations had a significantly higher code churn than large files without violations before the refactoring. After the refactoring, the files that had violations show a more normal code churn. We find no such effect on code ownership. We conclude that files that contain violations detectable by SACC methods are connected to higher than normal code <b>churn.</b> Information <b>and</b> Software Qualti...|$|R
