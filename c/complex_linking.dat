We can design shots with the knowledge that we have this brilliant digital miniature that we can do anything with. With a practical Hogwarts, we would have shot it last summer and been so tied down.

50|$|The {{anaphase}} promoting complex {{associated to}} Cdc20 (APC/C-cdc20) cleaves the securin (anaphase inhibitor), which holds the sister chromatids together. Securin is cleaved at anaphase, following APC/C-cdc20 mediated degradation, and it renders separase (a protease, inhibited by the association with securin) to cleave the kleisin subunit. An alpha-kleisin {{is associated with}} the cohesin <b>complex,</b> <b>linking</b> both SMC 3 and SMC 1 together, with the exact kleisin varying between mitosis and meiosis (Scc1 and Rec8 respectively), and its cleavage ultimately leads to the removal of cohesin from chromosomes.|$|E

For most Montrealers, however, {{it tends to be}} considered more as a large mall <b>complex</b> <b>linking</b> Metro stations — they may not even know they are in it. Many Canadian cities have some kind of tunnel or skywalk system downtown to help people avoid the weather. Most parts of the Montreal underground city are open while the Metro is in operation (5:30 AM to 1:00 AM), though some are closed outside of business hours. Maps of the underground city and the Metro can be obtained free of charge from all Metro stations, and the network of buildings is indicated on most maps of the downtown core.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new " model for binary three-way three-mode data, called Tucker 3 hierarchical classes model (Tucker 3 -HICLAS).

Like the INDCLAS model, the Tucker 3 -HICLAS model includes a hierarchical classification {{of the elements}} of each mode, and a linking structure among the three hierarchies. Unlike INDCLAS, Tucker 3 -HICLAS (a) does not restrict the hierarchical classifications of the three modes to have the same rank, and (b) allows for more <b>complex</b> <b>linking</b> structures among the thi'ee hierarchies. An algorithm to fit the Tucker 3 -HICLAS model is described and evaluated in an extensive simulation study. An application of the model to hostility data is discussed.

40|$|To use natural language, {{speakers}} must map {{the participants}} in events or states in the world onto grammatical roles. There remains considerable disagreement {{about the nature of}} these so-called linking rules (Levin & Rappaport Hovav, 2005). In order to probe the nature of linking rules, we investigate verbs of psychological state, which demonstrate <b>complex</b> <b>linking</b> patterns both within and between languages. We find that the typical duration of the psychological state guides the application of linking rules to novel verbs in both English and Japanese, consistent with a universal constraint. Nonetheless, there are marked differences in the baseline preferences for the individual linking rules across the two languages. We discuss these findings both in terms of theories of exceptionless linking rules and accounts on which linking rules are governed by probabilistic biases as well as crosslinguistic variation...|$|E

40|$|The dystrophin–glycoprotein complex (DGC) can be {{considered}} as a specialized adhesion <b>complex,</b> <b>linking</b> the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton, primarily in muscle cells. Mutations in several components of the DGC lead to its partial or total loss, resulting in various forms of muscular dystrophy. These typically manifest as progressive wasting diseases with loss of muscle integrity. Debate is ongoing about the precise function of the DGC: initially a strictly mechanical role was proposed but {{it has been suggested that}} there is aberrant calcium handling in muscular dystrophy and, more recently, changes in MAP kinase and GTPase signalling have been implicated in the aetiology of the disease. Here, we discuss new and interesting developments in these aspects of DGC function and attempt to rationalize the mechanical, calcium and signalling hypotheses to provide a unifying hypothesis of the underlying process of muscular dystrophy...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{techniques}} for semi-automated traceability link recovery between source code and documentation {{have recently been}} proposed to support the reverse engineering and maintenance of legacy systems. This {{is only the first}} step in supporting the long term maintainability of such systems. A crucial issue, after recovering traceability links is analyzing their general conformance over time. That is, as a system is changed during evolution the validity and conformance of the links may change. Thus, conformance analysis must be performed to identify possible non-conformance of the links. The paper presents a holistic view of how to combine link recovery with conformance analysis that is facilitated by a formal hypertext model. This hypertext model not only supports <b>complex</b> <b>linking</b> structures (e. g., multi links) but also supports versioning of individual links. Such a model preserves and maintains over time the results of the reverse engineered traceability links. ...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear RNA {{metabolism}} {{is influenced}} by protein complexes connecting to both RNA-productive and -destructive pathways. The ZC 3 H 18 protein binds the cap-binding complex (CBC), universally present on capped RNAs, while also associating with the nuclear exosome targeting (NEXT) <b>complex,</b> <b>linking</b> to RNA decay. To dissect ZC 3 H 18 function, we conducted interaction screening and mutagenesis of the protein, which revealed a phosphorylation-dependent isoform. Surprisingly, the modified region of ZC 3 H 18 associates with core histone proteins. Further examination of ZC 3 H 18 function, by genome-wide analyses, demonstrated its impact on transcription of a subset of protein-coding genes. This activity requires the CBC-interacting domain of the protein, with some genes being also dependent on the NEXT- and/or histone-interacting domains. Our data {{shed light on the}} domain requirements of a protein positioned centrally in nuclear RNA metabolism, and they suggest that post-translational modification may modulate its function...|$|E
