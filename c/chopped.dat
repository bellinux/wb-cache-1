40|$|Background and Aims: C/EBP {{homologous}} protein (<b>CHOP)</b> plays pro-apoptotic {{roles in the}} integrated stress response. Recently, a tumor suppressive role for <b>CHOP</b> was demonstrated in lung cancer via regulation of tumor metabolism. To explore the role of <b>CHOP</b> in hepatocarcinogenesis, we induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in wild type (wt) and <b>CHOP</b> knockout (KO) mice using the carcinogen N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Results: Analysis of tumor development showed reduced tumor load, with markedly smaller tumor nodules in the <b>CHOP</b> KO animals, suggesting oncogenic roles of <b>CHOP</b> in carcinogen-induced HCC. In wt tumors, <b>CHOP</b> was exclusively expressed in tumor tissue, with minimal expression in normal parenchyma. Analysis of human adenocarcinomas of various origins demonstrated scattered expression of <b>CHOP</b> in the tumors, pointing to relevance in human pathology. Characterization of pathways that may contribute to preferential expression of <b>CHOP</b> in the tumor identified ATF 6 as a potential candidate. ATF 6, a key member of the endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling machinery, exhibited a similar pattern of expression as <b>CHOP</b> and strong activation in wt but not <b>CHOP</b> KO tumors. Because HCC is induced by chronic inflammation, we assessed whether <b>CHOP</b> deficiency affects tumor-immune system crosstalk. We found {{that the number of}} macrophages and levels of IFNc and CCL 4 mRNA were markedly reduced in tumors from <b>CHOP</b> KO relative to wt mice, suggesting a role for <b>CHOP</b> in modulating tumor microenvironment and macrophage recruitment to the tumor...|$|R
40|$|Upon {{exposure}} to environmental stress, phosphorylation of the Œ± subunit of eIF 2 (eIF 2 Œ±-P) represses global protein synthesis, coincident with preferential translation of gene transcripts that mitigate stress damage or alternatively trigger apoptosis. Because {{there are multiple}} mammalian eIF 2 kinases, each responding to different stress arrangements, this translational control scheme {{is referred to as}} the integrated stress response (ISR). Included among the preferentially translated mRNAs induced by eIF 2 Œ±-P is that encoding the transcription factor <b>CHOP</b> (DDIT 3 /GADD 153). Enhanced levels of <b>CHOP</b> promote cell death when ISR signaling is insufficient to restore cell homeostasis. Preferential translation of <b>CHOP</b> mRNA occurs by a mechanism involving ribosome bypass of an inhibitory upstream ORF (uORF) situated in the 5 '-leader of the <b>CHOP</b> mRNA. In this study, we used biochemical and genetic approaches to define the inhibitory features of the <b>CHOP</b> uORF and the biological consequences of loss of the <b>CHOP</b> uORF on <b>CHOP</b> expression during stress. We discovered that specific sequences within the <b>CHOP</b> uORF serve to stall elongating ribosomes and prevent ribosome reinitiation at the downstream <b>CHOP</b> coding sequence. As a consequence, deletion of the <b>CHOP</b> uORF substantially increases the levels and modifies the pattern of induction of <b>CHOP</b> expression in the ISR. Enhanced <b>CHOP</b> expression leads to increased expression of key <b>CHOP</b> target genes, culminating in increased cell death in response to stress...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Endoplasmic {{reticulum}} (ER) stress {{contributes to}} beta cell death in {{type 2 diabetes}} (T 2 DM). ER stress is characterized by increased level of ER stress markers such as C/EBP homologous protein (<b>CHOP).</b> Activation of <b>CHOP</b> leads to its translocation into the nucleus, where it induces cell death. We previously reported nuclear <b>CHOP</b> in pancreatic sections from T 2 DM, but not T 1 DM, and in human islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) transgenic rodent pancreatic sections.
