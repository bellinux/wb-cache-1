5|$|Cumulus <b>clouds</b> {{are often}} {{precursors}} of {{other types of}} cloud, such as cumulonimbus, when influenced by weather factors such as instability, moisture, and temperature gradient. Normally, cumulus <b>clouds</b> produce little or no precipitation, but they can grow into the precipitation-bearing congestus or cumulonimbus <b>clouds.</b> Cumulus <b>clouds</b> can be formed from water vapor, supercooled water droplets, or ice crystals, depending upon the ambient temperature. They come in many distinct subforms, and generally cool the earth by reflecting the incoming solar radiation. Cumulus <b>clouds</b> are part of the larger category of free-convective cumuliform <b>clouds,</b> which include cumulonimbus <b>clouds.</b> The latter genus-type is sometimes categorized separately as cumulonimbiform due to its more complex structure that often includes a cirriform or anvil top. There are also cumuliform <b>clouds</b> of limited convection that comprise stratocumulus (low-), altocumulus (middle-étage) and cirrocumulus. (high-étage). These last three genus-types are sometimes classified separately as stratocumuliform.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus humilis <b>clouds</b> usually {{indicate}} fair weather. Cumulus mediocris <b>clouds</b> are similar, {{except that}} they have some vertical development, which implies that they can grow into cumulus congestus or even cumulonimbus <b>clouds,</b> which can produce heavy rain, lightning, severe winds, hail, and even tornadoes. Cumulus congestus <b>clouds,</b> which appear as towers, will often grow into cumulonimbus storm <b>clouds.</b> They can produce precipitation. Glider pilots often {{pay close attention to}} cumulus <b>clouds,</b> as they can be indicators of rising air drafts or thermals underneath that can suck the plane high into the skya phenomenon known as cloud suck.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus {{supplementary}} features are most commonly {{seen with the}} species congestus. Cumulus virga <b>clouds</b> are cumulus <b>clouds</b> producing virga (precipitation that evaporates while aloft), and cumulus praecipitatio produce precipitation that reaches the Earth's surface. Cumulus pannus comprise shredded <b>clouds</b> that normally appear beneath the parent cumulus cloud during precipitation. Cumulus arcus <b>clouds</b> have a gust front, and cumulus tuba <b>clouds</b> have funnel <b>clouds</b> or tornadoes. Cumulus pileus <b>clouds</b> refer to cumulus <b>clouds</b> that have grown so rapidly as to force the formation of pileus {{over the top of}} the cloud. Cumulus velum <b>clouds</b> have an ice crystal veil over the growing top of the cloud.|$|E

5|$|Night <b>clouds</b> or noctilucent <b>clouds</b> are {{composed}} of tiny crystals of water ice up to 100nm in diameter and exist at a height of about , higher than any other <b>clouds</b> in Earth's atmosphere. <b>Clouds</b> in the Earth's lower atmosphere form when water collects on particles, but mesospheric <b>clouds</b> may form directly from water vapour in addition to forming on dust particles.|$|E
5|$|On Jupiter, cirrus <b>clouds</b> are {{composed}} of ammonia. When Jupiter's South Equatorial Belt disappeared, one hypothesis put forward by Glenn Orten was that a large quantity of ammonia cirrus <b>clouds</b> had formed above it, hiding it from view. NASA's Cassini probe detected these <b>clouds</b> on Saturn and thin water-ice cirrus on Saturn's moon Titan. Cirrus <b>clouds</b> composed of methane ice exist on Uranus. On Neptune, thin wispy <b>clouds</b> which could possibly be cirrus have been detected over the Great Dark Spot. As on Uranus, these are probably methane crystals.|$|E
5|$|The game {{contains}} {{three types}} of clouds: white <b>clouds,</b> which follow the avatar; gray, neutral <b>clouds,</b> which become white when touched; and black <b>clouds,</b> which may be combined with white <b>clouds</b> to cause rain, dissolving both <b>clouds.</b> A large number of white <b>clouds</b> more easily dissolves {{a small number of}} dark <b>clouds</b> than an equal number, and vice versa. White <b>clouds</b> stop following the avatar if the player moves too quickly and they resume following if approached again. Each of the four missions in Cloud has a different objective, including forming patterns in the sky with <b>clouds,</b> eliminating black <b>clouds,</b> and creating rain over each of the islands.|$|E

The aim is to avoid confusion and facilitate a common understanding between <b>cloud</b> service providers and <b>cloud</b> service customers. <b>Cloud</b> service agreements and their associated <b>cloud</b> SLAs vary between <b>cloud</b> service providers, and in some cases, different <b>cloud</b> service customers can negotiate different contract terms with the same <b>cloud</b> service provider for the same <b>cloud</b> service.|$|R
5|$|A {{stratocumulus}} cloud {{is another}} type of a cumuliform or stratocumuliform cloud. Like cumulus <b>clouds,</b> they form at low levels and via convection. However, unlike cumulus <b>clouds,</b> their growth is almost completely retarded by a strong inversion. As a result, they flatten out like stratus <b>clouds,</b> giving them a layered appearance. These <b>clouds</b> are extremely common, covering on average around twenty-three percent of the earth's oceans and twelve percent of the earth's continents. They are less common in tropical areas and commonly form after cold fronts. Additionally, stratocumulus <b>clouds</b> reflect {{a large amount of}} the incoming sunlight, producing a net cooling effect. Stratocumulus <b>clouds</b> can produce drizzle, which stabilizes the cloud by warming it and reducing turbulent mixing. Being a cloud of limited convection, stratocumulus is divided into three species; stratiformis, lenticularis, and castellanus, that are common to the higher stratocumuliform genus-types.|$|E

5|$|At {{the sight}} of hail <b>clouds,</b> the alovit man would fall into a trance-like sleep, before his soul issued from his body and flew up to the <b>clouds.</b> In the manner of an ala, his soul led the <b>clouds</b> over the fields of a {{neighbouring}} village. A man, who {{was thought to be}} alovit, was described as unusually tall, thin, and bony-faced, with a long beard and moustache. When the weather was good, he worked and behaved like the others in his village, but as soon as dark <b>clouds</b> covered the sky, he would close himself in his house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone {{for as long as the}} bad weather lasted. People also talked that he suffered from epilepsy.

30|$|From the {{perspective}} of <b>cloud</b> market mechanism we imagine that if a <b>cloud</b> broker represents a <b>cloud</b> provider, then the <b>cloud</b> broker may provide information which favors that <b>cloud</b> provider; however, if a broker is independent, and its business depends on the trust relations with users, the broker is more motivated to find and provide information being truly helpful for <b>cloud</b> users. This situation may occur when a <b>cloud</b> broker serves as a gateway for {{a large number of}} <b>cloud</b> users in the <b>cloud</b> market. Consistent with the above view, we further imagine that if a <b>cloud</b> broker is highly trusted by some <b>cloud</b> users (especially, end <b>cloud</b> users), the broker may become those <b>cloud</b> users’ trust anchor, taking care of trust management for those <b>cloud</b> users.|$|R

5|$|Cirrocumulus <b>clouds</b> form in {{patches and}} cannot cast shadows. They {{commonly}} appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of <b>clouds</b> with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like {{other members of}} the cumuliform and stratocumuliform categories, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus <b>clouds</b> tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These <b>clouds</b> do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus <b>clouds</b> come in four species which are common to all three genus-types that have limited-convective or stratocumuliform characteristics: stratiformis, lenticularis, castellanus, and floccus. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.|$|E
