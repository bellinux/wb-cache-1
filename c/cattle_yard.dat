60|$|Ah--you {{have been}} overhearing {{a good deal}} about {{companies}} of late, I see. But this I will tell you; that when you grow up, and have a vote and influence, it will be your duty, if you intend to be a good citizen, not only not to put the water-supply of England into the hands of fresh companies, but to help to take out of their hands what water-supply they manage already, especially in London; and likewise the gas-supply; and the railroads; and everything else, in a word, which everybody uses, and must use. For you must understand--at least as soon as you can--that though the men who make up companies are no worse than other men, and some of them, as you ought to know, very good men; yet what they have to look to is their profits; and the less water they supply, and the worse it is, the more profit they make. For most water, I am sorry to say, is fouled before the water companies can get to it, as this water which runs past us will be, and as the Thames water above London is. Therefore it has to be cleansed, or partly cleansed, at a very great expense. So water companies have to be inspected--in plain English, watched--at a very heavy expense to the nation, by government officers; and compelled to do their best, and take their utmost care. And so it has come to pass that the London water is not now nearly as bad as some of it was thirty years ago, when it was no more fit to drink than that in the <b>cattle</b> <b>yard</b> tank. But still we must have more water, and better, in London; for it is growing year by year. There are more than three millions of people already in what we call London; and ere you are an old man there may be between four and five millions. Now to supply all these people with water is a duty which we must not leave to any private companies. It must be done by a public authority, as is fit and proper in a free self- governing country. In this matter, as in all others, we will try to do what the Royal Commission told us four years ago we ought to do. I hope that you will see, though I may not, the day when what we call London, but which is really, nine-tenths of it, only a great nest of separate villages huddled together, will be divided into three great self-governing cities, London, Westminster, and Southwark; each with its own corporation, like that of the venerable and well-governed City of London; each managing its own water-supply, gas-supply, and sewage, and other matters besides; and managing them, like Dublin, Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, and other great northern towns, far more cheaply and far better than any companies can do it for them.|$|E

50|$|Stables and Attached <b>Cattle</b> <b>Yards</b> The stables and the <b>cattle</b> <b>yards</b> {{attached}} to them are located approximately thirty to fifty metres further east along the entrance roadway. The stable building is sited in the south-eastern corner of the square shaped yards. It is rectangular in plan, with the long sides running parallel to the roadway. The roof is clad in corrugated iron. The yards are approximately twenty-five metres square. A number of trees line the yard fences.|$|R

50|$|North Melbourne's first {{institutions}} {{were built in}} the 1840s, beginning with a <b>cattle</b> <b>yard.</b> At this time the area was not well defined and included Parkville and Royal Park, as well as a part of West Melbourne.|$|E
5000|$|The {{station was}} on the 1902 line, west of the village and {{to the south of}} the Allington road, and was the only {{intermediate}} station on the military line to [...] There were two platforms, a goods siding and a <b>cattle</b> <b>yard.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{branch line}} was built from Linton {{junction}} to the Ballarat <b>Cattle</b> <b>Yards</b> and Redan in 1886. This line was closed in 1997.|$|R
50|$|By 1916 Einasleigh station {{consisted}} of a station building, siding, telephone, scales, fork, <b>cattle</b> <b>yards,</b> and a horse and cart loading bank. By 1935 it also had a goods shed (not extant). As both Einasleigh and Forsayth were expected to provide substantial amounts of copper ore, {{the importance of the}} towns' railway terminals meant that station master's houses, designed by Frew, were built at both towns. A branch line to the Einasleigh copper mine forked off {{to the north of the}} station, and today the remaining section off this line leads to <b>cattle</b> <b>yards.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{remains of}} the <b>cattle</b> <b>yards</b> are on a side line about 100 metres east of the station platform. There are modern yards on the site, but these are {{completely}} different in their layout from the tramway <b>yards.</b> A <b>cattle</b> dip was located to the south, of which a small section of the concrete floor and an intact drain remain. A few disturbed pieces of broken-up loading ramps {{are still on the}} site. Near the <b>cattle</b> <b>yards</b> there are some timber pieces of the railway station building lying loose, including the base of a 30 centimetre diameter post set in concrete.|$|R
50|$|The hamlet {{consists}} of several threshing barns, large storage barns, {{a variety of}} houses, forge, <b>cattle</b> <b>yard</b> and dairy, duck pond, donkey wheel, pig sties, chicken coops and old stables. There {{is also a very}} popular organic cafe in one of the courtyards just off the South Downs Way from where you can view the farm and the free range chickens.|$|E
50|$|The New South Wales Government {{approved}} the Tamworth Regional Council business plan in May 2007 that {{provided for the}} centreâ€™s construction. TRC contributed A$20 million with council cash, loans and reserves. The Australian Federal Government contributed $6.6 million and State government made grants of $3.65 million. Belmore Engineering of Tamworth won the tender worth about $350,000 for the <b>cattle</b> <b>yard</b> roofing and the campdrafting judge's tower.|$|E
50|$|On {{western side}} of the station track and to the south of the survey peg, are {{indications}} of former building and habitation sites. Timber stumps, corrugated iron sheeting and piles of roughly cut timber are concentrated in places here and in other areas within the main township area. These remnants are found in close association with exotic trees, usually mangoes. Other notable features within the township area are a number of bottle and rubbish dumpsites, the remains of an old dray or wagon and <b>cattle</b> <b>yard</b> fencing.|$|E
50|$|The {{area of the}} old {{township}} of Evelyn {{is comprised}} today of grassy paddocks and tall eucalyptus trees, and is used as grazing land for <b>cattle.</b> Timber <b>cattle</b> <b>yards</b> are constructed immediately behind the memorial.|$|R
50|$|Other {{buildings}} on site {{but beyond the}} homes enclosing fence includes an artists studio and flag pole, the managers house, garages, men's quarters, woolshed, <b>cattle</b> <b>yards</b> and remains of the stables, butchers shop, cold-room and icemaking room.|$|R
50|$|The {{property}} has {{an average}} stocking rate of approximately 6,500 head of cattle. It {{is equipped with}} a three bedroom homestead, a four bedroom staff house, workers quarters, workshop, sheds, <b>cattle</b> <b>yards</b> and is divided into 14 paddocks.|$|R
50|$|The McTaggart {{family have}} owned the {{property}} and been running cattle since 1980, but placed the property {{on the market in}} 2014 after suffering through drought, the stress of feral goats, wild dogs and finding staff. The property was placed on the market in 2014 for 1.5 million. The price included the five bedroom stone homestead, three bedroom cottage, three bedroom outcamp, five stand stone shearing shed, <b>cattle</b> <b>yard,</b> hanger, and shearers' quarters. A herd of approximately 200 droughtmaster cattle were included in the sale.|$|E
50|$|There is a siding at Wirra Wirra (208.5 km from Almaden), on the {{tableland}} of the Newcastle Range. Within {{the rail}} reserve {{there is a}} remnant of the east branch of the fork; and concrete slabs and concrete water tank footings south of the main line. Outside the railway reserve, near {{the location of the}} removed western arm of the fork, there is an earth and steel loading bank and some timber <b>cattle</b> <b>yard</b> posts. The modern QR telephone box and its supporting infrastructure are not significant.|$|E
5000|$|The {{event was}} {{leaked to the}} press on 23 May 1975, and was front-page news the {{following}} day. As a result, Monash University banned the event, and 'the media were on alert'. On the morning of 26 May 1975, Beverley was slaughtered in a <b>cattle</b> <b>yard</b> in Wheelers Hill, 'not far from where the Monash Gallery of Art stands today,' was then 'loaded onto a utility van, and with news crew in tow' was driven to the NGV, her carcass dumped in the forecourt.|$|E
2500|$|In 1965 a new {{freight yard}} and goods shed were {{established}} {{to the west}} of the original one, followed by the September 1967 opening of a new station building (the present-day structure). [...] The sheep and <b>cattle</b> <b>yards</b> were removed in August 1969.|$|R
50|$|Kauroa saleyards, 5 km {{north of}} Te Mata, were first used on 21 January 1914, {{replacing}} sheep and <b>cattle</b> <b>yards</b> further north. Local farmers formed Kauroa Saleyards Society in 1977, when the yards were threatened with closure, {{and continue to}} hold sales.|$|R
50|$|With the {{addition}} of a new grandstand, the Townsville Showground was complete as a dedicated showground facility offering numerous exhibition halls, substantial <b>cattle</b> <b>yards,</b> horse and dairy buildings and poultry sheds with the show ring neatly encompassed by a white picket fence.|$|R
50|$|This {{original}} {{station was}} located {{in the town of}} Sale itself, east of Reeve Street. It was a dead-end terminus, with the line from Melbourne and the line to Stratford both entering from the west. Trains continuing along the line beyond Sale were required to reverse at the station, or use the Traralgon-Maffra-Stratford line, which avoided Sale altogether. At the peak of operations, the yard had five roads, passenger and goods platforms, a goods shed, a 47-lever signal box, a <b>cattle</b> <b>yard,</b> an engine shed, a coal stage, and a turntable.|$|E
50|$|The {{working and}} {{maintenance}} of the Etheridge railway {{was taken over by}} the government from 5 February 1911. From the beginning, cattle were transported from the various stations and sidings along the line, but this traffic increased in importance with the decline of mining. Apart from the main stations on the line {{there were a number of}} sidings, the majority situated between Almaden and Mount Surprise. Little survives at these sidings today, other than siding tracks, concrete slabs, some signals and points' equipment, loading banks and <b>cattle</b> <b>yard</b> remnants.|$|E
50|$|Extensive cattle yards are {{contained}} in 8 sections which include over 100 cattle stall partitions. Fence post are former rail track sections with a top plate and middle rails of steel piping, with welded infill of galvanised reinforcing mesh. Each stall is serviced by a water trough with water reticulated from a raised central water system with intermittent taps. Six aisles allow pedestrian inspection of the yards and each aisle has a concrete pavement with a square paved pattern and laid to a fall. Several shade trees {{are present in the}} <b>cattle</b> <b>yard</b> area. All trees are introduced species.|$|E
25|$|Before Kauroa saleyards {{were first}} used on 21 January 1914, sheep and <b>cattle</b> <b>yards</b> had {{existed at the}} start of the road to Waingaro. Local farmers formed Kauroa Saleyards Society in 1977, when the yards were {{threatened}} with closure, and continue to hold sales.|$|R
50|$|The {{property}} {{was placed on}} the market by the trustees of the estate of D. F. MacKay in 1904. Stocked with about 15,000 Durham cattle and 187 horses the 934 sq mi station included managers house, men's quarters store house, <b>cattle</b> <b>yards</b> and two recently sunk bores.|$|R
50|$|The {{homestead}} complex comprises a single-storeyed timber residence {{with early}} garden, tennis court and orchard; a two-storeyed shearers' quarters; a machinery shed; a s cottage clad with fibrous cement (not {{considered to be}} of heritage significance); and <b>cattle</b> <b>yards</b> {{to the south of}} the timber residence.|$|R
50|$|When {{the loading}} race was {{destroyed}} in a shunting accident in 1955 it was proposed to close the station to all goods traffic {{on account of the}} low volume handled there. This move was delayed, at first by a desire to retain the loop for train crossing purposes should that be required by a change in traffic patterns brought about by the Rimutaka Tunnel, and later by objections from local farmers. The farmers wanted to construct a permanent <b>cattle</b> <b>yard</b> and extend the existing sheep holding yard to increase their throughput at the station. The Department was agreeable to the proposal on the understanding that goods traffic at the station would increase, and supplied the materials to the farmers who carried out the work, completed in 1959.|$|E
50|$|In 1908 Lyndbrook (69 km) had a goods shed, engine shed, station {{house and}} forkline. It was named Lyndbrook in December 1909, and by 1935 it {{consisted}} of a siding, telephone, fork, side loading bank, shelter, and goods shed (the latter was removed that year). Private cattle yards existed by 1954, but no cattle have been loaded since January 1993. Fossilbrook Creek (77 km) consisted of a telephone in 1950. Nearby Fossilbrook was a busy tin-mining town in 1905, with two hotels, but nothing remains of the town. Frewhurst (88 km) had a sawmill about 1908, and was named in 1909. By 1916 it had a gate, siding, telephone and loading bank. It had a shelter by 1935, and a private <b>cattle</b> <b>yard</b> by 1951, which was enlarged in the mid 1970s. Livestock has not been handled from Frewhurst since late 1991.|$|E
5000|$|The line leaves Nuremberg Hauptbahnhof to the west, {{initially}} running {{parallel with}} the lines to Bamberg and to Augsburg. The line crosses the Frankenschnellweg freeway and the connecting tracks to the former main freight yard and the <b>cattle</b> <b>yard</b> and passes through Schweinau, Schweinau station and the industrial area of Tillypark. It then crosses the Ring line (Ringbahn), the SÃ¼dwesttangente ("South-west tangent" [...] freeway) and the Main-Danube Canal and reaches NÃ¼rnberg-Stein station, where the Bibert Railway (Bibertbahn) branched off to Unternbibert-RÃ¼gland until 1986. After the line crosses the Rednitz river, it runs through Unterasbach and Oberasbach and continues between the Bibert river {{to the north and}} federal highway B14 to the south through RoÃŸtal and Heilsbronn to Wicklesgreuth. There a branch line runs to Windsbach and a siding runs to the United States Army military base at Katterbach. Near Lichtenau forest, the line continues to Sachsen bei Ansbach and from there runs {{parallel with the}} FrÃ¤nkische Rezat and from the Ansbach district of Eyb it runs next to the railway line from Treuchtlingen to Ansbach station.|$|E
50|$|A 7.6 km private tramway (built to QR standard) junctioning {{from just}} south of the Collinsville station {{connected}} to the Scottsville mine opened in the same year, and also served the <b>cattle</b> <b>yards.</b> A 1.5 km spur to the Dacon mine also opened in 1922, and closed in 1983.|$|R
50|$|The cattle drafter (or {{drafting}} whip) is a cane or fibreglass rod with a handgrip, knob {{and wrist}} strap. The cane length is about 75 cm (2'6") and the flapper length is about 30 cm (12") long. These whips {{are used in}} <b>cattle</b> <b>yards</b> and also when moving pigs.|$|R
50|$|On {{the right}} hand side of the dairy {{pavilion}} {{are a series of}} open air blue painted steel pipe livestock stalls which run the full length of dairy and long the northern side of the <b>cattle</b> <b>yards</b> and end at the cattle ramps located at the Cattle Sales Arena.|$|R
