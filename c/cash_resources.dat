30|$|It {{is likely}} that the Fulani of the KGR have {{developed}} a breeding strategy which focuses on the breeding of some heifers for sale and of males as fat-stock but in which milk is not an important <b>cash</b> <b>resource.</b> Elsewhere, this has been described as ‘a variant of specialised milking strategies’ (Amanor 1995): the example of a study undertaken by Fricke (1979) is cited where the majority of stock were sold young, between the ages of two and three, with up to 15 % of total sales consisting of heifers. The isolation of KGR from other non-pastoralist communities, and responses during focus group discussions, indicate that there is only a small market for dairy products, due to the distance to be travelled on foot to sell these products. KGR households are reliant on young stock sales to generate cash, to compensate for the absence of a milk market.|$|R

Pao and his managers were quick to spot the problem and commenced a programme to reduce the fleet, especially crude oil carriers, selling ships as they came off charter. 140 ships were sold and the fleet reduced by half over a period of 4 to 5 years allowing debt to be paid off and <b>cash</b> <b>resources</b> built up.

2500|$|... "The {{short answer}} {{is that there was}} no single reason for the collapse, which was caused by a number of {{contributory}} factors. Court Line expanded rapidly in many directions, some of which were both logical and justifiable, others not. The overall management was throughout inadequate and it was in any event never supported by the necessary financial control. This meant that as Court Line expanded, it became progressively vulnerable to any substantial setback in any of its areas of activities. When a serious setback occurred, triggered off by the oil crisis of autumn 1973, it immediately affected the shipping, aviation, and leisure divisions. The group was so highly geared, so structured and having such inadequate financial control, that it might well have been brought down by a substantial reverse in any of its major activities. As it was the cumulative effect on all three divisions, when all the <b>cash</b> <b>resources</b> which would otherwise have been available had been invested unprofitably in the Caribbean, meant that the position progressively deteriorated and rendered the collapse in August 1974 unavoidable." ...|$|E

50|$|Fortunately, {{a method}} known as system {{dynamics}} captures both the math of asset-stock accumulation (i.e. resource- and capability-building), and the interdependence between these components (Forrester, 1961; Sterman, 2000).The asset-stocks relevant to strategy performance are resources {{we have and}} capabilities we are good at doing. This {{makes it possible to}} connect back to the resource-based view, though with one modification. RBV asserts that any resource which is clearly identifiable, and can easily be acquired or built, cannot be a source of competitive advantage, so only resources or capabilities that are valuable, rare, hard to imitate or buy, and embedded in the organization ‘VRIO’ criteria can be relevant to explaining performance, for example reputation or product development capability.
