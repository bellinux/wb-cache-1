5000|$|The {{following}} table gives a {{chronological overview}} of the mainline railway lines in Norway. It explicitly excludes tramway, light rail and metro lines, spurs and industrial lines. It contains the date the section opened, the line the segment is currently considered part of, {{the name of the}} line {{at the time of the}} opening (if different from the current name). Some railways have simply changed name, while others have been merged with other lines. The table further gives the length of the line, the gauge and number of tracks (single, double or quadruple), all at the time the line opened. Many railway lines have since been shortened and some have been doubled and been through gauge conversion. Standard gauge is , <b>CAP</b> <b>gauge</b> is [...] and meter gauge is [...] Railway which opened as private are marked, even though many were later nationalized. In later years, many new sections are major realignments, typically tunnels, which shorten an existing line.|$|E

5000|$|The Bemis Manufacturing Company is an American {{manufacturing}} {{company based in}} Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin and {{is best known for}} its toilet seat products. Bemis also manufactures plastic lawn, commercial, and indoor furniture, suction canisters, sharps containers, fluid management systems, gas <b>caps,</b> <b>gauges</b> and various contracted extrusion and injection molded plastic parts for companies such as John Deere and Whirlpool Corporation. The company is a pioneer of co-injection molding, a process in which virgin resin is injected with scrap plastic. Bemis' plastic work has won a number of awards in the SPI Structural Plastics Div. design competition, particularly with the John Deere 7000 tractor, which is believed to represent the first instance of coinjection molding [...] "to large parts where a recycled engineering material (ABS) is used in the core".|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} been carried out to {{investigate}} the response of 2 x 2 pile group subjected to triangular soil movement. The pile group was instrumented with displacement and tilting devices at the pile <b>cap</b> and strain <b>gauges</b> on two piles of the group. In this paper, results from four model tests were presented to study the effects of axial loads and soil density on the lateral behavior of piles. The responses in terms of bending moment, shear force, soil pressure, deflection, and rotation of piles were compared. Test results indicate that increasing the soil strength could increase the measured moment, shear, soil pressure, and pile deformations. Most importantly, adding loads to the pile cap induces additional moment to the head of frontpile row unlike the back-pile row which was influenced insignificantly...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the decomposition of noncommutative gauge potential (A) over cap (i), {{and find that}} it has inner structure, namely, (A) over cap (i) can he decomposed in two parts, (b) over cap (i) and (a) over cap (i), where (b) over <b>cap</b> (i) satisfies <b>gauge</b> transformations while (a) over cap (i) satisfies adjoint transformations, so close the Seiberg-Witten mapping of noncommutative, U(1) gauge potential. By, means of Seiberg-Witten mapping, we construct a mapping of unit vector field between noncommutative space and ordinary space, and find the noncommutative U(1) gauge potential and its gauge field tensor can be {{expressed in terms of}} the unit vector field. When the unit vector field has no singularity point, noncommutative gauge potential and gauge field tensor will equal ordinary gauge potential and gauge field tensorTalent Introduction Project of Xianyang Normal University 07 XSYK 21...|$|R
