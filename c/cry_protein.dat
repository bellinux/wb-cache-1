5|$|M. vitrata {{causes the}} most {{damage to the}} growing cowpea due to their large host range and {{cosmopolitan}} distribution. It causes damage to the flower buds, flowers and pods of the plant with infestations resulting in a 20–88% loss of yield. While the insect can cause damage through all growth stages, most of the damage occurs during flowering. Biological control has had limited success, so most preventative methods rely {{on the use of}} agrichemicals. Genetically modified cowpeas are being developed to express the <b>cry</b> <b>protein</b> from Bacillus thuringiensis, which is toxic to lepidopteran species including the Maruca.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, genetically {{modified}} maize producing Bt <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> was approved, which killed the European corn borer and related species; subsequent Bt genes were introduced that killed corn rootworm larvae.|$|E
50|$|Overexpression of Cry {{also affects}} {{circadian}} light responses. In Drosophila, Cry overexpression increases flies' sensitivity to low-intensity light. This light regulation of <b>CRY</b> <b>protein</b> levels suggests that CRY has a circadian role upstream of other clock genes and components.|$|E
40|$|Genetically {{modified}} (GM) crops {{have achieved}} {{success in the}} marketplace and their benefits extend beyond the overall increase in harvest yields to include lowered use of insecticides and decreased carbon dioxide emissions. The most widely grown GM crops contain gene/s for targeted insect protection, herbicide tolerance, or both. Plant expression of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crystal (<b>Cry)</b> insecticidal <b>proteins</b> have been the primary way to impart insect resistance in GM crops. Although deemed safe by regulatory agencies globally, previous studies have been the basis for discussions around the potential immuno-adjuvant effects of <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins.</b> These studies had limitations in study design. The studies used animal models with extremely high doses of <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins,</b> which when given using the ig route were co-administered with an adjuvant. Although the presumption exists that <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> may have immunostimulatory activity and therefore an adjuvanticity risk, the evidence shows that <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> are expressed at very low levels in GM crops and are unlikely to function as adjuvants. This conclusion is based on critical review of the published literature {{on the effects of}} immunomodulation by <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins,</b> the history of safe use of <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> in foods, safety of the Bt donor organisms, and pre-market weight-of-evidence-based safety assessments for GM crop...|$|R
40|$|Presented thesis {{examines}} possible {{environmental impact}} of the genetically modified (GM) maize expressing insecticidal <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins.</b> The impact was assessed from differences in the communities of the ground and above-ground arthropods in plots sown with the standard and the GM maize, respectively. The results revealed that neither the abundance nor the species richness of arthropods was affected. Laboratory experiments were used to study effect of maize expressing several types of <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> on the arthropod predators. Despite the proven exposure of the predators to <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> in the food, no <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> accumulation and deleterious effects on predators were observed. The results confirm the importance of predators in insect resistance management using the GM maize seed blends method...|$|R
30|$|Mezzomo et al. (2013) {{reported}} that Bt spore preparations containing various <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> {{were found to}} cause hemato-toxocity in mice when administered by oral gavage. However, Koch et al. (2015) mentioned that such a result {{could be due to}} spore components other than <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cryptochrome, {{like many}} genes {{involved}} in circadian rhythm, shows circadian cycling in mRNA and protein levels. In Drosophila, Cry mRNA concentrations cycle under a light-dark cycle (LD), {{with high levels}} in light and low levels in the dark. This cycling persists in constant darkness (DD), but with decreased amplitude. The transcription of the Cry gene also cycles with a similar trend. <b>CRY</b> <b>protein</b> levels, however, cycle in a different manner than Cry transcription and mRNA levels. In LD, <b>CRY</b> <b>protein</b> has low levels in light and high levels in dark, and, in DD, CRY levels increase continuously throughout the subjective day and night. Thus, CRY expression is regulated by the clock {{at the transcriptional level}} and by light at the translational and posttranslational level.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, a novel {{functional}} group of <b>Cry</b> <b>protein,</b> designated parasporin, was discovered from noninsecticidal B. thuringiensis isolates. The proteins of parasporin group {{are defined as}} B. thuringiensis and related bacterial parasporal proteins that are not hemolytic, but capable of preferentially killing cancer cells. As of January 2013, parasporins comprise six subfamilies (PS1 to PS6).|$|E
5000|$|The After-hours {{mutation}} is a {{substitution of}} cysteine to serine at position 358. Similar to Overtime, the mutation {{occurs in the}} region where FBXL3 binds to CRY. Mice homozygous for the Afh mutation have a free running period of about 27 hours. The Afh mutation delays the rate of <b>CRY</b> <b>protein</b> degradation, therefore affecting the transcription of PER2 protein.|$|E
50|$|In 1996 another {{class of}} insecticidal {{proteins}} in Bt was discovered; the vegetative insecticidal proteins (Vip). Vip proteins {{do not share}} sequence homology with <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins,</b> in general do not compete for the same receptors, and some kill different insects than do <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins.</b>|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that around 200 cry genes from Bacillus thuringiensis have already been cloned, only a few <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> are toxic towards a given pest. A crucial step {{in the mode of}} action of <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> is binding to {{specific}} sites in the midgut of susceptible insects. Binding studies in insects that have developed cross-resistance discourage the combined use of <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> sharing the same binding site. If resistance management strategies are to be implemented, the arsenal of <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> suitable to control a given pest may be not so vast as it might seem at first. The present study evaluates the potential of B. thuringiensis for the control of a new pest, the geranium bronze (Cacyreus marshalli Butler), a butterfly that is threatening the popularity of geraniums in Spain. Eleven of the most common <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> from the three lepidopteran-active Cry families (Cry 1, Cry 2, and Cry 9) were tested against the geranium bronze for their toxicity and binding site relationships. Using 125 I-labeled <b>Cry</b> 1 A <b>proteins</b> we found that, of the seven most active <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins,</b> six competed for binding to the same site. For the long-term control of the geranium bronze with B. thuringiensis-based insecticides it would be advisable to combine any of the <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> sharing the binding site (preferably Cry 1 Ab, since it is the most toxic) with those not competing for the same site. Cry 1 Ba would be the best choice of these proteins, since it is significantly more toxic than the others not binding to the common site...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} use of <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> in insecticide formulations and transgenic crops for insect control {{has led to an}} increased interest in the environmental fate of these proteins. Several detection methods are available to monitor the fate of <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> in the environment, but enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) have emerged as the preferred detection method, because they are cost-effective, easy to use, and provide rapid results. Validation methodology, which is essential to ensure accurate measurement of <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> in environmental matrices, has been researched extensively, but most of this research has overlooked biological validation of ELISA results. This oversight has led to concerns that environmental studies utilizing ELISAs may be overestimating the concentrations of <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> in the environment, which may affect the risk assessments for these proteins. A literature review discusses the history and usage of <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> for insect pest control and discusses the use and validation of ELISAs for detection of <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> in environmental samples. The concept of biologically validating ELISA results is introduced, and a critical review of published literature examines the state of ELISA usage and validation, including identifying areas for improvement. Eight different types of model systems were screened for their ability to produce fragments of <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab <b>protein,</b> and five of these model systems prove capable of generating Cry 1 Ab fragments. The fragments from these five model systems are then analyzed with ELISAs and bioassays to determine if the fragments are detectable or retain bioactivity. Fragments from four of the model systems are not detectable by ELISA and do not retain bioactivity. Fragments from the fifth model system are detectable by ELISA and do retain bioactivity. These results indicate that the use of ELISAs in environmental fate studies are providing an accurate determination of the concentrations of <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> in the environment and are not overestimating the concentrations. However, further work is needed utilizing additional model systems, including microbe-based model systems, in order to fully understand the fate of <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> in the environment...|$|R
50|$|Cry6Aa is a toxic {{crystal protein}} {{generated}} by the bacterial family Bacillus thuringiensis during sporulation. This protein {{is a member of}} the alpha pore forming toxins family, which gives it insecticidal qualities advantageous in agricultural pest control. Each <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> has some level of target specificity; Cry6Aa has specific toxic action against coleopteran insects and nematodes. The corresponding B. thuringiensis gene, cry6aa, is located on bacterial plasmids. Along with several other <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> genes, cry6aa can be genetically recombined in Bt corn and Bt cotton so the plants produce specific toxins. Insects are developing resistance to the most commonly inserted proteins like Cry1Ac. Since Cry6Aa proteins function differently than other Cry proteins, they are combined with other proteins to decrease the development of pest resistance. Recent studies suggest this protein functions better in combination with other virulence factors such as other Cry proteins and metalloproteinases.|$|E
5000|$|Mice {{with the}} {{homozygous}} mutation of Ovtm, free run with an intrinsic period of 26 hours. Overtime {{is a loss}} of function mutation caused by a substitution of isoleucine to threonine {{in the region of}} FBXL3 that binds to CRY. In mice with this mutation, levels of the proteins PER1 and PER2 are decreased, while levels of CRY proteins do not differ from those of wild type mice. The stabilization of <b>CRY</b> <b>protein</b> levels leads to continued repression of Per1 and Per2 transcription and translation.|$|E

50|$|Concerns {{over the}} safety of {{consumption}} of genetically-modified plant materials that contain <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> have been addressed in extensive dietary risk assessment studies. While the target pests {{are exposed to the}} toxins primarily through leaf and stalk material, <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> are also expressed {{in other parts of the}} plant, including trace amounts in maize kernels which are ultimately consumed by both humans and animals.|$|R
30|$|Interestingly, Palma et al. (2014) {{reported}} that 700 Bt <b>cry</b> genes (<b>Cry</b> <b>proteins)</b> {{have been identified}} in the past decades. While many <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> have pesticidal properties against insect pests in agriculture, others have no known invertebrate targets and have been termed “parasporins”. Some of this parasporin group of Bt <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> such as <b>Cry</b> 31 A, Cry 41 A, Cry 46 A and Cry 64 A exhibit strong and specific cytocidal activity against human cancer cells of various origins. They have been given the alternative names: parasporin- 1 (PS 1), parasporin- 2 (PS 2), parasporin- 3 (PS 3), parasporin- 4 (PS 4), parasporin- 5 (PS 5), and parasporin- 6 (PS 6).|$|R
40|$|Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is {{the most}} successful, environmentally-friendly, and intensively studied {{microbial}} insecticide. The major characteristic of Bt is the production of proteinaceous crystals containing toxins with specific activity against many pests including dipteran, lepidopteran, and coleopteran insects, as well as nematodes, protozoa, flukes, and mites. These crystals allow large quantities of the protein toxins to remain stable in the environment until ingested by a susceptible host. It has been previously established that 135 kDa <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> have a crystallization domain at their C-terminal end. In the absence of this domain, <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> often need helper proteins or other factors for crystallization. In this review, we classify the <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> based on their requirements for crystallization...|$|R
50|$|Cry mutants {{have altered}} {{circadian}} rhythms, showing that Cry affects the circadian pacemaker. Drosophila with mutated Cry exhibit {{little to no}} mRNA cycling. A point mutation in cryb, which is required for flavin association in <b>CRY</b> <b>protein,</b> results in no PER or TIM protein cycling in either DD or LD. In addition, mice lacking Cry1 or Cry2 genes exhibit differentially altered free running periods, but are still capable of photoentrainment. However, mice that lack both Cry1 and Cry2 are arrhythmic in both LD and DD and always have high Per1 mRNA levels. These results suggest that cryptochromes play a photoreceptive role, as well as acting as negative regulators of Per gene expression in mice.|$|E
50|$|Transgenic {{crops that}} act as {{insecticides}} began in 1996 with a genetically modified potato that produced the <b>Cry</b> <b>protein,</b> derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, which is toxic to beetle larvae such as the Colorado potato beetle. The technique has been expanded to {{include the use of}} RNA interference RNAi that fatally silences crucial insect genes. RNAi likely evolved as a defense against viruses. Midgut cells in many larvae take up the molecules and help spread the signal. The technology can target only insects that have the silenced sequence, as was demonstrated when a particular RNAi affected only one of four fruit fly species. The technique is expected to replace many other insecticides, which are losing effectiveness due to the spread of pesticide resistance.|$|E
50|$|Critics {{claim that}} Bt {{proteins}} could target predatory and other beneficial or harmless insects {{as well as}} the targeted pest. These proteins have been used as organic sprays for insect control in France since 1938 and the USA since 1958 with no ill effects on the environment reported. While cyt proteins are toxic towards the insect order Diptera (flies), certain cry proteins selectively target lepidopterans (moths and butterflies), while other cyt selectively target Coleoptera. As a toxic mechanism, cry proteins bind to specific receptors on the membranes of mid-gut (epithelial) cells, resulting in rupture of those cells. Any organism that lacks the appropriate gut receptors cannot be affected by the <b>cry</b> <b>protein,</b> and therefore Bt. Regulatory agencies assess the potential for the transgenic plant to impact nontarget organisms before approving commercial release.|$|E
30|$|It {{should also}} be noted that, in general, the {{systemic}} delivery of Bt <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> poses more significant risks to animals and humans ingesting Bt crops than applications of Bt insecticides via liquid sprays. Systemic delivery also enhances a range of environmental and ecological risks [47] compared to foliar Bt use patterns that result in rapid breakdown of Bt <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> as they are exposed to sunlight and rainfall.|$|R
30|$|Studies {{conducted}} in Australia, USA, China and India {{have indicated that}} the <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> in transgenic Bt cotton are available throughout the cropping season with temporal and spatial variations (Kranthi et al. 2005 and Shera and Arora 2016). So the target and non-target arthropods are continuously exposed directly or indirectly to <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins,</b> expressed in Bt cotton plants. At the third trophic level, predators and parasitoids may get exposed to <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins,</b> when they feed on herbivores that have consumed plant tissues having Bt protein (Torres et al. 2006; Mota et al. 2012; and Kumar et al. 2014). Exposure on the third trophic level through prey is the most realistic exposure pathway {{that needs to be}} addressed as an important component of environment risk assessment.|$|R
40|$|The cry gene family, {{produced}} {{during the late}} exponential phase of growth in Bacillus thuringiensis, is a large, still-growing family of homologous genes, in which each gene encodes a protein with strong specific activity against only {{one or a few}} insect species. Extensive studies are mostly focusing on the structural and functional relationships of <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins,</b> and have revealed several residues or domains that are important for the target recognition and receptor attachment. In this study, we have employed a maximum likelihood method to detect evidence of adaptive evolution in <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins,</b> and have identified 24 positively selected residues, which are all located in Domain II or III. Combined with known data from mutagenesis studies, the majority of these residues, at the molecular level, contribute much to the insect specificity determination. We postulate that the potential pressures driving the diversification of <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> may be in an attempt to adapt for the “arm race” between δ-endotoxins and the targeted insects, or to enlarge their target spectra, hence result in the functional divergence. The sites identified to be under positive selection would provide targets for further structural and functional analyses on <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins...</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{different}} mechanism may {{function in}} Drosophila. The true ground {{state of the}} flavin cofactor in Drosophila CRY is still debated, with some models indicating that the FAD is in an oxidized form, while others support a model in which the flavin cofactor exists in anion radical form, •. Recently, researchers have observed that oxidized FAD is readily reduced to • by light. Furthermore, mutations that blocked photoreduction {{had no effect on}} light-induced degradation of CRY, while mutations that altered the stability of • destroyed CRY photoreceptor function. These observations provide support for a ground state of •. Researchers have also recently proposed a model in which [...] is excited to its doublet or quartet state by absorption of a photon, which then leads to a conformational change in the <b>CRY</b> <b>protein.</b>|$|E
50|$|A major use of GM crops is in insect control {{through the}} {{expression}} of the cry (crystal delta-endotoxins) and Vip (vegetative insecticidal proteins) genes from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Such toxins could affect other insects in addition to targeted pests such as the European corn borer. Bt proteins have been used as organic sprays for insect control in France since 1938 and the US since 1958, with no reported ill effects. Cry proteins selectively target Lepidopterans (moths and butterflies). As a toxic mechanism, cry proteins bind to specific receptors on the membranes of mid-gut (epithelial) cells, resulting in their rupture. Any organism that lacks the appropriate receptors in its gut is unaffected by the <b>cry</b> <b>protein,</b> and therefore is not affected by Bt. Regulatory agencies assess the potential for transgenic plants to affect non-target organisms before approving their commercial release.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, Reppert began {{investigating}} the functional and evolutionary {{properties of the}} <b>CRY</b> <b>protein</b> in the monarch butterfly. He identified two Cry genes in the monarch, Cry1 and Cry2.His work demonstrated that the monarch CRY1 protein is functionally analogous to Drosophila CRY, the blue-light photoreceptor necessary for photoentrainment in the fly. He also demonstrated that monarch CRY2 is functionally analogous to vertebrate CRYs and that monarch CRY2 acts as a potent transcriptional repressor in the circadian clock transcriptional translation feedback loop of the butterfly, as his group previously showed for the two mouse CRYs. These data propose {{the existence of a}} novel circadian clock unique to some non-drosophilid insects that possesses mechanisms characteristic of both the Drosophila and the mammalian clocks. Other insects, such as bees and ants, possess only a vertebrate-like CRY, and their circadian clocks are even more vertebrate like. Drosophila is the only known insect that does not possess a vertebrate-like CRY.|$|E

Through {{the damage caused by}} their feeding, the larvae of cocoa pod borer cause the pods of the cocoa tree to ripen prematurely. They are difficult to control with conventional measures. Preliminary assays identified five toxins that were more active than others. In two subsequent bioassays the activity of selected toxins was determined more accurately. Three <b>Cry</b> 1 <b>proteins</b> with relatively little homology were all found to be toxic, opening perspectives for controlling cocoa pod borer by expression of <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> in transgenic plant...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Circadian {{oscillation}} of clock-controlled {{gene expression}} is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level. Heterodimers of CLOCK and BMAL 1 act as activators of target gene transcription; however, interactions of PER and <b>CRY</b> <b>proteins</b> with the heterodimer abolish its transcriptional activation capacity. PER and CRY are therefore {{referred to as}} negative regulators of the circadian clock. To further elucidate the mechanism how positive and negative components of the clock interplay, we characterized the interactions of PER 2, CRY 1 and CRY 2 with BMAL 1 and CLOCK using a mammalian two-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Results Both PER 2 and the <b>CRY</b> <b>proteins</b> were found to interact with BMAL 1 whereas only PER 2 interacts with CLOCK. <b>CRY</b> <b>proteins</b> {{seem to have a}} higher affinity to BMAL 1 than PER 2. Moreover, we provide evidence that PER 2, CRY 1 and CRY 2 bind to different domains in the BMAL 1 protein. Conclusion The regulators of clock-controlled transcription PER 2, CRY 1 and CRY 2 differ in their capacity to interact with each single component of the BMAL 1 -CLOCK heterodimer and, in the case of BMAL 1, also in their interaction sites. Our data supports the hypothesis that <b>CRY</b> <b>proteins,</b> especially <b>CRY</b> 1, are stronger repressors than PER proteins. </p...|$|R
40|$|Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) {{microbial}} pesticides have a 50 -year {{history of}} safe use in agriculture. <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> {{are among the}} active insecticidal ingredients in these pesticides, and genes coding for <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> have been introduced into agricultural crops using modern biotechnology. The Cry gene sequences are often modified to enable effective expression in planta and several <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> have been modified to increase biological activity against the target pest(s). Additionally, the domains of different but structurally conserved <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> can be combined to produce chimeric proteins with enhanced insecticidal properties. Environmental studies are performed and include invertebrates, mammals and avian species. Mammalian studies used to support the food and feed safety assessment are also used to support the wild mammal assessment. In addition to the NTO assessment, the environmental assessment includes a comparative assessment between the Bt crop and the appropriate conventional control that is genetically similar but lacks the introduced trait to address unintended effects. Specific phenotypic, agronomic, and ecological characteristics are measured in the Bt crop and the conventional control to evaluate whether {{the introduction of the}} insect resistance has resulted in any changes that might cause ecological harm in terms of altered weed characteristics, susceptibility to pests, or adverse environmental impact. Additionally, environmental interaction data are collected in field experiments for Bt crop to evaluate potential adverse effects. Further to the agronomic and phenotypic evaluation, potential movement of transgenes from a genetically modified crop plants into wild relatives is assessed for a new pest resistance gene in a new crop. This review summarizes the evidence for safety of crops containing <b>Cry</b> <b>proteins</b> for humans, livestock, and other non-target organisms...|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} combat growing pest resistance, Cry6Aa is {{implemented}} in transgenic plants because it targets pests differently, increasing susceptibility. DNA shuffling {{is the process}} of selecting genes of compatible Cry proteins to transfer into crops. Although the binding site of Cry6Aa is unknown, several sites have been ruled out, allowing successful <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> stacking. Because an organism has to be resistant to both expressed Cry proteins to survive, the chances of developing and vertically transferring resistance is lower, granting more time for pesticide research. In 2013, Cry6Aa and Cry3Aa combination transgenic plants were patented to prevent resistance in the western corn rootworm. [...] Additionally, Cry6Aa has been layered with Cry34Ab1/Cry35Ab1, a binary toxin. Pyramiding Cry proteins can enhance the effect of toxins. Cry6Aa and Cry55Aa both can reduce brood size of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita, but when they are combined, these two proteins are five times more effective. Synergy between Cry proteins comes from either improved toxin docking, membrane insertion, or advanced degradation of the midgut protein matrix which increases action of the slower acting toxin.|$|E
5000|$|The protein encoded by the Bmal1 gene in mammals binds with {{a second}} bHLH-PAS protein via the PAS domain, CLOCK (or its paralog, NPAS2) to form a {{heterodimer}} in the nucleus. Via its BHLH domain, this heterodimer binds to E-box response elements in the promoter regions of Per (Per1 and Per2) and Cry genes (Cry1 and Cry2). This binding upregulates the transcription and translation of PER1, PER2, CRY1 and CRY2 proteins. [...] After the PER and CRY proteins have accumulated to sufficient levels, they interact by their PAS motifs to form a large repressor complex that travels into the nucleus to inhibit the transcriptional activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer [...] This inhibits the transcription of Per and Cry genes, and causes protein levels of PER and CRY drop. This transcription, translation negative feedback loop (TTFL) is modulated in the cytoplasm by phosphorylation of PER proteins by casein kinase 1ε or δ (CK1 ε or CK1 δ), signaling these proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome. SIRT1 also regulates PER protein degradation by inhibiting transcriptional activity of the BMAL1:CLOCK heterodimer in a circadian manner through deacetylation. The degradation of PER proteins prevents the formation the large protein complex, and thus prevents the inhibition of transcriptional activity of the BMAL1:CLOCK heterodimer. The <b>CRY</b> <b>protein</b> is also signaled for degradation by poly-ubiquination from the FBXL3 protein, also preventing the inhibition of the CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer. This allows transcription of the Per and Cry genes to resume. It has also been observed in the TTFL loop of nocturnal mice that transcription levels of the Bmal1 gene peak at CT18, during the mid-subjective night, anti-phase to the transcription levels of Per, Cry, and other clock control genes, which peak at CT6, during the mid-subjective day. This process occurs with a period length of approximately 24 hours and supports the notion that this molecular mechanism is rhythmic.|$|E
30|$|According to the {{experimental}} results, the <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> represents approximately 6 % of the dry cell weight. This result is below some previously reported values (Table 3). However, {{there is not enough}} reports using SDS-PAGE for <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> quantification and therefore it is difficult to establish a comparison. The <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> concentrations reported in literature are scattered and confused. For example, while Rowe and Margaritis ([1987]) reported that after cell lysis the endospore and <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> mass were 15 % of the biomass dry weight, Agaisse and Lereclus ([1995]) reported that <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> can account for up to 25 % of the dry weight of the sporulated cells. Even some values from the literature of <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> concentration are much higher, for example: Anderson and Jayaraman ([2005]) reported 98 % of the biomass dry weight (calculated from the reported values of 15.7 g/L of <b>Cry</b> <b>protein</b> from 16 g/L of biomass, Table 3). Considering these data, the yields coefficient of Cry from biomass are 0.98 g Cry/g biomass (Table 3), which means that almost every cell is transformed into <b>Cry</b> <b>protein.</b> In the same way, the yield coefficient of Cry from biomass obtained by Chang et al. ([2008]) and Dang Vu et al. ([2009]) seems excessively high (Table 3).|$|E
50|$|A similar {{model is}} found in mice, in which BMAL1 dimerizes with CLOCK to {{activate}} per and cryptochrome (cry) transcription. PER and <b>CRY</b> <b>proteins</b> form a heterodimer which acts on the CLOCK-BMAL heterodimer to repress the transcription of per and cry. The heterodimer CLOCK:BMAL1 functions similarly to other transcriptional activator complexes; CLOCK:BMAL1 interacts with the E-box regulatory elements.

25|$|The most {{important}} proteins {{which make up}} the mammalian TTNFL are the Period (PER), and Cryptochrome (<b>CRY)</b> <b>proteins,</b> BMAL1, CLOCK, and casein kinase 1 epsilon. PER and CRY levels are regulated by negative feedback, meaning that they repress their own transcription. BMAL1 and CLOCK work to increase PER and CRY transcription by binding on the E-box domain upstream from the PER and CRY gene coding sequences. The level of PER and <b>CRY</b> <b>proteins</b> is regulated by casein kinase 1 through phosphorylation, which marks these proteins for degradation by the cell. Phosphorylation also hinders PER's ability to enter the nucleus by inducing a conformational change in its nuclear localization sequence. However, if <b>CRY</b> <b>proteins</b> bind to PER before this phosphorylation can occur, all three proteins stabilize into a complex that can enter the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, PER and CRY can work to inhibit their own transcription, while casein kinase 1 epsilon works to modulate the activity of BMAL1 and CLOCK through phosphorylation.|$|R
