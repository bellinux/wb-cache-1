40|$|<b>Option</b> <b>written</b> {{on several}} foreign {{exchange}} rates (FXRs) depends on {{correlation between the}} rates. To evaluate the option, historical estimates for correlations can be used but usually they are not stable. More significantly, pricing of the option using these estimates is usually inconsistent to the traded vanilla contracts. To price <b>options</b> <b>written</b> on several FXRs with the same denominating currency, financial practitioners and traders often use implied correlations calculated from implied volatilities of FXRs that form "currency triangles". However, some options may have underlying FXRs with different denominating currencies. In this paper, we present the formula for the implied correlations between such FXRs. These {{can be used for}} valuation, for example, barrier option on two FXRs with different denominating currencies where one FXR determines how much the option is in or out of the money at maturity while another FXR is related to the barrier. Other relevant options are straightforward. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we study the {{replication}} of options in security markets X with {{a finite number of}} states. Specifically, we study the existence of maximal submarkets (subspaces) Y of X so that any <b>option</b> <b>written</b> on the elements of Y is replicated by a marketed asset x of X. So inside these subspaces the pricing problem is simple because any option is priced by the replicating portfolio. Using the theory of lattice-subspaces and positive bases developed by Polyrakis (Trans Am Math Soc 348 : 2793 - 2810, 1996; 351 : 4183 - 4203, 1999), we identify the set of all maximal replicated subspaces. In particular, for any maximal replicated subspace we determine a positive basis of the subspace. Moreover we show that the union of all maximal replicated subspaces is the set of all marketed securities x ε X so that any <b>option</b> <b>written</b> on x is replicated. So we determine also the set of securities with replicated options. © 2009 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the pattern of}} stock option time value decay {{and the implications of}} the time value decay pattern for <b>option</b> <b>writing</b> strategies. I also consider the returns to various <b>options</b> <b>writing</b> strategies. The central question is whether option writers can utilize a writing strategy that captures the time value of options as revenue to cover their risks and provides return on their investments. 	 Using transaction data, I find that the time value of options that are near-the-money decays at a decreasing rate. The implications of this result are that {{a significant portion of the}} time value of near-the-money options decays in the early days of <b>writing</b> an <b>option</b> and the decay slows down as time to expiry approaches. This motivates us to compare over the same holding periods the <b>writing</b> returns of <b>options</b> with long times to expiry with the returns of options with short times to expiry. Overall, the results suggest that trading of options face significant transaction costs and it is mainly motivated by hedging or speculation as I did not find a systematic way to profit from <b>option</b> <b>writing</b> strategies. In addition, I examine the impact of market sentiment on the time value of options. The period of the study includes a sub-period when the general trend in the stock market was positive and another sub-period when the trend was negative. In particular, I study the price of puts relative to the price of calls during these two distinct market periods. I find that during bear markets both call and put options are more expensive than call and put options during bull markets. Yet, the ratio of put premiums to call premiums during rising markets is generally higher than the same ratio during bear markets. This observation suggests that speculators may be the dominant traders in options markets. Overall, I find that <b>option</b> <b>writing</b> strategies are not profitable. One of the reasons for this observation is transaction costs, which are significant in all the strategies that I examine. The bid-ask spread in the options market is large in comparison to the bid-ask spread in the underlying stock market...|$|R

40|$|We use a supply-demand {{approach}} to value energy products exposed to emission cost uncertainty. We find closed form solutions {{for a number}} of popularly traded energy derivatives such as: forwards, European call <b>options</b> <b>written</b> on spot prices and European Call <b>options</b> <b>written</b> on forward contracts. Our modeling approach is to first construct noisy supply and demand processes and then equate them to find an equilibrium price. This approach is very general while still allowing for sensitivity analysis within a valuation setting. Our assumption is that, in the presence of emission costs, traditional supply growth will slow down causing output prices of energy products to become more costly over time. However, emission costs do not immediately cause output price appreciation, but instead expose individual projects, particularly those with high emission outputs, to much more extreme risks through the cost side of their profit stream. Our results have implications for hedging and pricing for producers operating in areas facing a stochastic emission cost environment.

40|$|Perpetual American {{warrants}} {{have been}} {{traded on the}} stock exchanges or over the counter at least since 1929, as is emphasized {{in several of the}} “mostread” finance books. The first rational model to evaluate perpetual American call options appeared as early as 1965, when McKean (Samuelson’s Appendix) derived a closed-form valuation formula under the now-standard hypothesis of a geometric Brownian motion for the price of the underlying stock. A formula for perpetual American put options was later derived by Merton [1973] for the no-dividend case. In this article, the formulas for perpetual American <b>options,</b> <b>written</b> on dividend-paying stocks, are expressed in a more intuitive way by defining the “distance to exercise. ” After proving that perpetual American options follow a geometric Brownian motion, I show the put-call parity by using perpetual first-touch digitals.
