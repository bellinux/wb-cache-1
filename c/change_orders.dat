But that was not all; an additional 623 engineering <b>change</b> <b>orders</b> were made and completed after delivery. Grissom became so frustrated with {{the inability of the}} training simulator engineers {{to keep up with the}} spacecraft changes, that he took a lemon from a tree by his house and hung it on the simulator.|$|E
25|$|By {{this time}} all active admirals who could {{intervene}} {{and call the}} NTC to answer were either killed in the opening stages of the Russo-Japanese War or heading to the Battle of Tsushima. Skvortsov continued to fight the NTC chaos alone. In October–December 1904 he persuaded the NTC to replace practically useless hand-cranked firefighting pumps with Worthington steam pumps He argued that the arrangement of bilge pumps of different capacities, favored by the NTC, was inadequate to the purpose, and persuaded the designers to use standard 500 tonne-per-hour pumps. These small improvements did not change the already obsolete design, and construction proceeded at a slow pace, frequently interrupted by redesign proposals, <b>change</b> <b>orders,</b> rework and inevitable delays. After the completion of Andrey Pervozvanny its builders identified seventeen distinct stages of its design.|$|E
2500|$|The {{disastrous}} {{experiences of}} the Russo-Japanese War led to countless redesigns, <b>change</b> <b>orders</b> and delays in construction. After the completion of Andrey Pervozvanny its builders identified seventeen distinct stages of her design. Andrey Pervozvanny was launched in October 1906 but subsequent alterations delayed completion until 1911. Almost all of her hull was armored, albeit thinly; redesign and refinement of protective armor continued until 1912. The ship's artillery mixed novel quick-firing long range 8-inch guns with obsolescent 12-inch 40 caliber main guns. The Andrey Pervozvanny-class battleships became the only battleships of the Old World fitted with lattice masts, which were replaced with conventional masts {{at the beginning of}} World War I. The imposing ships, the largest in the Russian Navy until the completion of the [...] dreadnoughts, were obsolete from the start: by the time of their sea trials the Royal Navy had already launched the [...] super-dreadnoughts.|$|E

40|$|Implementation {{stage on}} a {{construction}} {{project is a}} stage playing {{an important role in}} determining the project’s goal. <b>Change</b> <b>order’s</b> work is always in the building construction phase. The existence of <b>change</b> <b>order’s</b> work {{had an impact on the}} construction process in terms of time performance. Article finds out the influence of <b>change</b> <b>order’s</b> work on time performance of construction project and type of work which was most influenced. This research was conducted by using a questionnaire addressed to the project leaders of contractors who designed high-level building construction in Jakarta area. The research result showed <b>change</b> <b>order’s</b> work performed during construction to make the project time performance declined. The influence caused by the <b>change</b> <b>order’s</b> work could degrade the time performance to 5. 942 percent. If the <b>change</b> <b>order</b> did not happen, then the time performance would increase about 2. 666 percent from the previous planned time. This increase happened because of tolerance time made during the project planning, so that the decline of time performance occurred was not too big. If there was no <b>change</b> <b>order’s</b> work, the time tolerance would not be used. It is concluded that the project completion time will be faster than the planned time before, so that the time performance will increase...|$|R
2500|$|In 1905 the NTC flooded Skvortsov with a {{chain of}} {{conflicting}} and poorly formulated <b>change</b> <b>orders</b> influenced by war-time experience. The war demonstrated the uselessness of keeping small-calibre guns on capital ships; in May 1905 the NTC removed the 47-mm guns but instead added equally useless 75-mm guns in an upper deck casemate. The 75-mm guns were replaced with 120-mm guns in another round of redesign. Concentration of larger guns in the central citadel compelled the NTC to redesign the middle 8-inch guns, moving them one deck above their original placement. Another war reality, loss of control after direct hits against the bridge or the conning tower, caused {{the addition of a}} second conning tower. All hull portholes were replaced with solid armor, making Andrey Pervozvanny and Imperator Pavel I the least comfortable even for commissioned officers. These changes inevitably added more steel to an already overloaded ship; the NTC compensated overload with [...] "optimization" [...] of turret armor, further delaying completion.|$|E
2500|$|More {{recently}} {{configuration management}} {{has been applied}} to large construction projects which can often be very complex and have a huge amount of details and changes that need to be documented. Construction agencies such as the Federal Highway Administration have used configuration management for their infrastructure projects. There are construction-based configuration management tools that aim to document <b>change</b> <b>orders</b> and RFIs in order to ensure a project stays on schedule and on budget. These programs can also store information to aid in the maintenance and modification of the infrastructure when it is completed. [...] One such application, ccsNet, was tested in a case study funded by the Federal Transportation Administration (FTA) in which the efficacy of configuration management was measured through comparing the approximately 80% complete construction of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Agency (LACMTA) 1st and 2nd segments of the Red Line, a $5.3 billion rail construction project. [...] This study yielded results indicating a benefit to using configuration management on projects of this nature.|$|E

The research aimed at comparing <b>change</b> <b>order</b> in construction project in Nigeria and Oman, visà-vis the causes, effect, benefits and remedies. This was meant to compare the scenario of <b>change</b> <b>order</b> in both countries and subsequently determine areas for improvement in Nigeria. Questionnaire survey was use to elicit information. The questionnaires were analysed using Relative Importance Index. The result indicated that the “client’s additional works and modification to design ” were the most important causes of <b>change</b> <b>order</b> in both Nigeria and Oman, the most important effects of <b>change</b> <b>order</b> are “variations result in claims and disputes ” in Nigeria while “delay in completion date of project and cost overruns ” were the most important effects in Oman.
