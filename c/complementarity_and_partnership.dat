40|$|Abstract. Two key {{concepts}} of quantum theory, <b>complementarity</b> <b>and</b> entanglement, are considered {{with respect to}} their significance in and beyond physics. An axiomatically formalized, weak version of quantum theory, more general than the ordinary quantum theory of physical systems, is described. Its mathematical structure generalizes the algebraic approach to ordinary quantum theory. The crucial formal feature leading to <b>complementarity</b> <b>and</b> entanglement is the non-commutativity of observables. The ordinary Hilbert space quantum mechanics can be recovered by stepwise adding the necessary features. This provides a hierarchy of formal frameworks of decreasing generality and increasing specificity. Two concrete applications, more specific than weak quantum theory and more general than ordinary quantum theory, are discussed: (i) <b>complementarity</b> <b>and</b> entanglement in classical dynamical systems, <b>and</b> (ii) <b>complementarity</b> <b>and</b> entanglement in the bistable perception of ambiguous stimuli...|$|R
40|$|Niche <b>complementarity</b> <b>and</b> {{competitive}} disparity {{are driving}} mechanisms behind plant community assembly and productivity. Consequently, {{there is great}} interest in predicting species <b>complementarity</b> <b>and</b> their competitive differences from their functional traits as dissimilar species may compete less and result in more complete use of resources. Here we assessed the role of trait dissimilarities for species <b>complementarity</b> <b>and</b> competitive disparities within an experimental gradient of plant species richness and functional trait dissimilarity. Communities were assembled using three pools of grass and forb species based on a priori knowledge of traits related to (1) above- and below-ground spatial differences in resource acquisition, (2) phenological differences or (3) both. <b>Complementarity</b> <b>and</b> competitive disparities were assessed by partitioning the overyielding in mixed species communities into species <b>complementarity</b> <b>and</b> dominance effects. Community overyielding <b>and</b> the underlying <b>complementarity</b> <b>and</b> competitive dominance varied strongly among the three plant species pools. Overyielding <b>and</b> <b>complementarity</b> were greatest among species that were assembled based on their variation in both spatial and phenological traits. Competitive dominance was greatest when species were assembled based on spatial resource acquisition traits alone. In communities that were assembled based on species variation in only spatial or phenological traits, greater competitive dominance was predicted by greater differences in SLA and flowering initiation respectively, while greater complementarity was predicted by greater dissimilarity in leaf area and flowering senescence respectively. Greater differences in leaf area could also be linked to greater species complementarity in communities assembled based on variation in both phenological and spatial traits, but trait dissimilarity was unrelated to competitive dominance in these communities. Our results indicate that <b>complementarity</b> <b>and</b> competitive disparity among species are both driven by trait dissimilarities. However, {{the identity of the}} traits that drives the <b>complementarity</b> <b>and</b> competitive disparity depends on the trait variation among species that comprise the community. Moreover, we demonstrate that communities assembled with the greater variation in both spatial and phenological traits show the greatest complementarity among species.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a process model of how <b>and</b> why <b>complementarity</b> <b>and</b> substitution form over time between contractual and relational governance {{in the context}} of information systems outsourcing. Our analysis identifies four distinct process patterns that explain this formation as the outcome of interaction processes between key elements of both contractual and relational governance. These patterns unveil the dynamic nature of <b>complementarity</b> <b>and</b> substitution. In particular, we show that the relationship between contractual and relational governance oscillates between <b>complementarity</b> <b>and</b> substitution. Those oscillations are triggered mainly by three types of contextual events (goal fuzziness, goal conflict, and goal misalignment). Surprisingly, substitution of informal control did not occur as an immediate reaction to external events but emerged as a consequence of preceding complementarity. Thus, our study challenges the prevailing view of an either/or dichotomy of <b>complementarity</b> <b>and</b> substitution by showing that they are causally connected over time...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that a single {{stranded}} DNA molecule might produce a hairpin structure due to two biological principles, namely Watson-Crick <b>complementarity</b> <b>and</b> annealing. In many DNA-based algorithms, these DNA molecules cannot {{be used in the}} subsequent computations. Hairpin or hairpin-free DNA structures have numerous applications to DNA computing and molecular genetics. Suggested by the two aforementioned biological phenomena together with that of lengthening DNA by polymerases, we defined in [1] a new unary operation called hairpin completion. This operation might be defined informally as follows: (i) a word z = xwxy in which a hairpin structure determined by the Watson-Crick <b>complementarity</b> <b>and</b> annealing of x and x appears produces, by means of polymerases, the new word yxwxy. (ii) a word z = yxwx in which a hairpin structure determined determined by the Watson-Crick <b>complementarity</b> <b>and</b> annealing of x and x appears produces, by means of polymerases, the new word yxwxy.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} an optimization problem with <b>complementarity</b> constraints <b>and</b> second-order cone constraints. The mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC) has extensively been studied because MPCC has wide application such as engineering design, traffic equilibrium and game theory. Recently, second-order cone programming {{has also been}} studied intensively in relation to robust optimization under uncertainty. To the author’s knowledge, however, theoretical and algorithmic results about problems that contain both <b>complementarity</b> <b>and</b> second-order cone constraints {{have yet to be}} reported.

Moreover, as an application, we formulate a mathematical model of smart house scheduling as a nonlinear second-order cone program with <b>complementarity</b> constraints, <b>and</b> give numerical results with the proposed method. ...|$|R

40|$|By {{studying}} the Hong Kong banking industry, {{the objective of}} this study is to examine the role of information <b>complementarity</b> <b>and</b> market competition in governing the diffusion of off-balance-sheet (OBS) financial innovations. Specifically, two OBS financial innovations are information complementary if the adoption of one lowers the uncertainty of adopting another. In addition, market competition may speed up the diffusion of OBS financial innovations because competitive firms are able to capture the full profit potential from successful innovations. A simultaneous equation model is devised to estimate the impacts of information <b>complementarity,</b> market competition, <b>and</b> a number of other factors on the diffusion of OBS financial innovations.
