At {{least one of the}} marrying partners must be a Spanish citizen, residing in the Consular demarcation. However, the marriage itself <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>take</b> place at the Consulate if local laws recognize same-sex marriages. In all other cases, the partners must marry in Spanish territory. Two non-resident foreigners cannot marry in Spain, as {{at least one of the}} partners must be a Spanish resident, although they both may be non-Spanish citizens.|$|E
5|$|Plants face severe {{challenges}} in arid environments. Problems {{they need to}} solve include how to obtain enough water, how to avoid being eaten and how to reproduce. Photosynthesis {{is the key to}} plant growth. It <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>take</b> place during the day as energy from the sun is required, but during the day, many deserts become very hot. Opening stomata to allow in the carbon dioxide necessary for the process causes evapotranspiration, and conservation of water is a top priority for desert vegetation. Some plants have resolved this problem by adopting crassulacean acid metabolism, allowing them to open their stomata during the night to allow CO2 to enter, and close them during the day, or by using C4 carbon fixation.|$|E
5|$|The census {{report of}} 2010 Zambian census was {{released}} {{during the first}} week of March 2013 by Fredson Yamba, Secretary to the Treasury of the Government of Zambia.

We now have the data, therefore, the challenge remains with all of us to ensure it is put into good use by making informed decisions for our people,”. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) helped the Government of Zambia, especially the Child Welfare Ministry to update the data from the Living Condition Monitoring Survey (LCMS) and data on all key performance indicators of the National Development Plan (ZNDP) during 2013.|$|E

25|$|Ammonium {{is thought}} to be the {{preferred}} source of fixed nitrogen for phytoplankton because its assimilation does not involve a redox reaction and therefore requires little energy. Nitrate requires a redox reaction for assimilation but is more abundant so most phytoplankton have adapted to have the enzymes necessary to undertake this reduction (nitrate reductase). There are a few notable and well-known exceptions that include Prochlorococcus and some Synechococcus. These species <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>take</b> up nitrogen as ammonium.|$|E

25|$|The {{basic unit}} of {{decision}} making in an inclusive democracy is the demotic assembly, i.e. the assembly of demos, the citizen body in a given geographical area which may encompass a town and the surrounding villages, or even neighbourhoods of large cities. An inclusive democracy today <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>take</b> {{the form of a}} confederal democracy that is based on a network of administrative councils whose members or delegates are elected from popular face-to-face democratic assemblies in the various demoi. Thus, their role is purely administrative and practical, not one of policy-making like that of representatives in representative democracy.|$|E

Notwithstanding, the King never consented on the petition of the assembly to meet at will, and from 1637 he decreed that the meetings of the assembly <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>take</b> place when in presence of one representative of the monarch, with voice, usually the Governor-Captain General of the Kingdom, so trying to maintain a tighter grip on the institution and its agreements.|$|E

25|$|Owing to {{the need}} for secrecy during the two months of filming, all {{candidates}} are made to sign a confidentiality agreement which prohibits all, but a few confidants nominated by them, to be told of where they will be during that time, which remains active after filming until the series has started broadcast, with all {{contact with the outside world}} restricted to a high level; each candidate gets a limited phone call once a week, and all have no access to newspapers, television or internet, while any electronic communication equipment they have (i.e. mobiles) is handed in before they begin. In addition, all candidates are made to remain in their accommodation throughout filming except when they must head out for a task, and <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>take</b> a day off if they are supervised by a chaperone from the production crew. As a result, the persistent presence of the cameras, the closeness of rivals in the competition and the lack of contact with families & friends, can cause considerable pressure and stress for a candidate between entering the process, to leaving it.|$|E
25|$|Pietersen scored 50 in England's opening game in Sri Lanka {{against the}} Sri Lankan Cricket XI, {{but it took}} until the fourth ODI for Pietersen to find form, scoring 63 not out as England won their first series in Sri Lanka. This form was still {{fluctuating}} in the warm-up matches for the Test series, scoring 4, 1 and 59 against the Sri Lankan Cricket XI. This run continued in the Test matches when in the first test he got two starts with 31 and 18 but didn't go on. He was unfortunate as in the second innings on 18 he was bowled by a ball that kept low from Dilhara Fernando. In the second test he managed 45 not out to secure a draw in the 2nd Test. In the first innings, Pietersen's dismissal {{was to be the}} source of much controversy. He edged his fifth ball to Chamara Silva at slip, who flicked the ball up for wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara to complete the catch. The two on-field umpires conferred over the validity of the catch, as it was unclear whether the ball had touched the ground prior to Silva flicking the ball up. Daryl Harper, standing at the bowler's end gave the decision that the wicket had been taken, but while walking off the field, Pietersen saw a replay on the big screen and questioned the validity of the decision. This led for calls for similar catches to be referred to the third (TV) umpire, but this <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>take</b> place if the on-field umpires have not made a decision. Pietersen passed 3,000 Test runs during the series, becoming the fastest player (by time) to do so, He only averaged 25.20, and failed to score a half century in a series for the first time.|$|E
500|$|Word classes {{also carry}} out differing {{functions}} in grammar. Prototypically, verbs {{are used to}} construct predicates, while nouns are used as arguments of predicates. In a sentence such as [...] "Sally runs", the predicate is [...] "runs", {{because it is the}} word that predicates a specific state about its argument [...] "Sally". Some verbs such as [...] "curse" [...] can take two arguments, e.g. [...] "Sally cursed John". A predicate that <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>take</b> a single argument is called intransitive, while a predicate that can take two arguments is called transitive.|$|E
