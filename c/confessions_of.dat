50|$|The <b>Confession</b> <b>of</b> Faith of the Evangelical United Brethren Church is one {{of three}} {{established}} Doctrinal Standards of the United Methodist Church, along with the Articles of Religion and the Standard Sermons of John Wesley.

5|$|Literature in Virginia often {{deals with}} the state's {{extensive}} and sometimes troubled past. The works of Pulitzer Prize winner Ellen Glasgow often dealt with social inequalities {{and the role of}} women in her culture. Glasgow's peer and close friend James Branch Cabell wrote extensively about the changing position of gentry in the Reconstruction era, and challenged its moral code with Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice. William Styron approached history in works such as The <b>Confessions</b> <b>of</b> Nat Turner and Sophie's Choice. Tom Wolfe has occasionally dealt with his southern heritage in bestsellers like I Am Charlotte Simmons. Mount Vernon native Matt Bondurant received critical acclaim for his historic novel The Wettest County in the World about moonshiners in Franklin County during prohibition. Virginia also names a state Poet Laureate.|$|E
5|$|The Reformed <b>confessions</b> <b>of</b> faith, {{official}} {{statements of}} the beliefs of Reformed churches, followed the view that Christ is really present in the Supper.

Some of the German-language Reformed confessions seem hesitant to make the sacrament a means of grace, but they all maintain {{that there is a}} union between the outward signs of the sacrament and the inward grace signified. Reformed orthodox theologians also continued to insist on Christ's real presence in the Supper, while denying against Lutherans that his body is locally present.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{agreement}} {{as to the}} order in which the murders took place. Burke made two confessions but gave different sequences for the murders in each statement. The first was an official one, given on 3 January 1829 to the sheriff-substitute, the procurator fiscal and the assistant sheriff-clerk. The second was {{in the form of an}} interview with the Edinburgh Courant that was published on 7 February 1829. These in turn differed from the order given in Hare's statement, although the pair were agreed on many of the points of the murders. Contemporary reports also differ from the <b>confessions</b> <b>of</b> the two men. More recent sources, including the accounts written by Brian Bailey, Lisa Rosner and Owen Dudley Edwards, either follow one of the historic versions or present their own order of events.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Confession</b> <b>of</b> Belhar and ecumenism {{against the}} {{backdrop}} of the Three Forms of Unity This article focuses on the <b>Confession</b> <b>of</b> Belhar and in- vestigates from an ecclesiastical and theological perspective the question whether this confession should be accepted and added as a fourth confession to the existing Three Forms of Unity. The following aspects are addressed: the origin and content <b>of</b> the <b>Confession</b> <b>of</b> Belhar, the ecclesiastical and theological reaction within the family of Dutch Reformed Churches as well as in the reformed ecumenical world. A critical analysis of the content is made and evaluated, and in con- clusion attention is given to a few options with regard to the place <b>of</b> the <b>Confession</b> <b>of</b> Belhar in the reformed ecumenical world in the future. A comparison between the Three Forms of Unity and the <b>Confession</b> <b>of</b> Belhar shows a definite difference in quality. The <b>Confession</b> <b>of</b> Belhar is not of a similar standard with regard to the theological and doctrinal content and structure of the Three Forms of Unity, and does not add quality or neglected faith-related value to these existing creeds...|$|R
