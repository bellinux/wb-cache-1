5|$|Abiodun Alao of King's College London {{marks the}} Entumbane episode as {{the start of}} the Zimbabwe National Army's politicisation. The ex-Rhodesians' enthusiasm and success during the battle, coupled with Mugabe's {{readiness}} to deploy them, convinced many in ZAPU that ZANU–PF and the white community had united against them, and intensified ZAPU opposition to the government. ZIPRA guerrillas deserted from the assembly points and the National Army en masse following the rebellion's failure, fearing for their safety. Mugabe's sense of resolve regarding his political rivals was greatly strengthened, meanwhile; Entumbane satisfied him that white army officers and airmen <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> on in future conflicts with ZAPU. The Entumbane engagement was the RAR's last—its companies were allocated to other 1Brigade units later in 1981 during the military reform process—but a number of its white officers subsequently led units of the Zimbabwean special forces during the 1980s. Dyck, for example, headed the 1st Parachute Battalion.|$|E

Had Northerners realized that most Southerners really did favor secession, they might have hesitated at attempting the enormous task of conquering a united South.|$|E

25|$|His Test {{career was}} not stellar, {{but he and}} fellow Pace bowler Karsan Ghavri were helpful in getting the shine off the new ball before India's famous spin bowlers (Bishen Singh Bedi, Chandrashekhar, Prasanna and Ventatraghavan) could take over. Binny and Ghavri (along with wicket keeper Syed Kirmani) were also {{credited}} with saving many test matches for India. When the top batting order collapsed, Binny <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> to hold the batting down {{so as to avoid}} innings defeats or drag the match to a draw.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} retain his {{independence}} from the Ottomans, who were closing in from the south, Lazarević turned to the Kingdom of Hungary, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> on militarily. After becoming a Hungarian vassal in 1403, Lazarević was offered peace by the Ottomans on his terms, and the Despotate {{was no longer a}} subject of the Ottoman Empire. Vuk returned to the Despotate shortly thereafter and the brothers ruled in accord. The Ottoman–Serbian peace, Hungarian–Serbian alliance, Hungarian ceding of large territories in the north to the Despotate, and the merger of Vlatković's province to Lazarević's domain, resulted in Lazarević expanding his claims on all the Serbian lands.|$|E

50|$|Count singing {{requires}} analyzing a piece or {{section of}} music {{to determine how to}} subdivide it. For example, music written in 4/4 time <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>count</b> sung as quarter notes ("one two three four"), eighth notes ("one and two and three and four and"), triplets ("one and a two and a three and a four and a"), or sixteenth notes ("one ee and a two ee and a three ee and a four ee and a"). The director decides how the choir should count, depending on how they want the choir to interpret the music.|$|R
25|$|The {{practice}} of using only whole {{numbers in the}} definitions comes from practical considerations {{in the days when}} only whole cycles <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> on paper records. This leads to gaps in the definitions, as seen elsewhere on this page. The theoretical definitions have always been more carefully defined to include all frequencies. Unfortunately there is no agreement in standard reference works on what these ranges should be – values for the upper end of alpha and lower end of beta include 12, 13, 14 and 15. If the threshold is taken as 14Hz, then the slowest beta wave has about the same duration as the longest spike (70ms), which makes this the most useful value.|$|E
25|$|The Muslim {{community}} did not lag behind, {{the faith}} spread. The central mosque was built about 1930 and thereafter, {{a number of}} mosques were built in Idemo, Umayo, Isato (Irona), Ogbonado, Okesa, Oke-Ila etc. The Ansar-Ud-Deen emerged in the early 1940s. As a matter of fact, the number of mosques {{and the number of}} Muslims who have performed the Hajj can readily come to hand as indices of expansion. The number of mosques increased substantially with the growing number of well-to-do Muslim who build mosques as annexes to their private homes; by the year 2000, more than forty mosques <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> in the city. By 1960, only Alhaji Akorede had performed the Hajj but the number of Alhajs increased in the 1970s and steadily increased in the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Ingo Haar who is {{currently}} {{on the faculty of}} the University of Vienna said on 14 November 2006 in Deutschlandfunk that about 500,000 to 600,000 victims are realistic, based on a German governmental studies initiated in the 1960s. Haar said these numbers were compiled from actually reported deaths, while higher figures of about two million deaths were estimated with the population balance method in a German governmental study of 1958. Haar said the higher estimates must be seen in the historical context of the 1950s, when the government of West Germany needed high numbers for political reasons. During the Cold War West Germany wanted to revert to prewar borders in Central Europe. Military historian Rüdiger Overmans said on 6 December 2006 in Deutschlandfunk that only the about 500,000 registered deaths <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>counted,</b> and that the unaccounted cases calculated with the population balance method need be confirmed by further research. However, on 29 November 2006 State Secretary in the German Federal Ministry of the Interior, Christoph Bergner, reaffirmed the position of the German government that 2 million civilians perished in the flight and expulsion from Central and Eastern Europe. The German Red Cross in 2005 maintained that death toll in the expulsions is 2,251,500 persons.|$|E

In 1306, when Pope Clement V asked the leaders of the military orders, Jacques de Molay and Fulk de Villaret, to present their proposals for how the Crusades should proceed, neither of them factored in any kind of a Mongol alliance. A few later proposals talked briefly about the Mongols as being a force that could invade Syria and keep the Mamluks distracted, but not as a force that <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> on for cooperation.|$|E

500|$|The {{fundamental}} social bond in {{late medieval}} Scottish society {{was that of}} kinship. Descent was agnatic, with {{members of a group}} sharing a (sometimes fictional) common ancestor, in the south often reflected in a common surname.

As a result, a shared surname has been seen as a [...] "test of kinship", proving large bodies of kin who could call on each other’s support and this could help intensify the idea of the feud, which was usually carried out as a form of revenge for a kinsman and for which a large bodies of kin <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>counted</b> on to support rival sides, although conflict between members of kin groups also occurred.|$|E
