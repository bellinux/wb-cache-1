30|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of doping hexanol into {{biodiesel}} which is from neat <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> shell biodiesel oil on the emissions and the performance characteristics was studied in a constant speed diesel engine. The main purpose of this work is to reduce various emissions and also to improve {{the performance of the}} diesel engine when fueled with blends of hexanol and neat <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> shell biodiesel. <b>Cashew</b> <b>nut</b> shell oil is not edible, and hence it {{can be used as a}} viable alternative to diesel. <b>Cashew</b> <b>nut</b> shell biodiesel is prepared by conventional transesterification. Hexanol with 99.2 % purity was employed as an oxygenated additive. Experimental studies were conducted by fueling diesel as a baseline and by fueling hexanol and neat <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> shell biodiesel mixture. A fuel comprising 10 % (by volume) of hexanol and 90 % (by volume) neat <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> shell biodiesel was referred to as CNSBD 900 H 100 and fuel comprising 20 % (by volume) of hexanol and 80 % (by volume) of neat <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> shell biodiesel was referred to as CNSBD 800 H 200. This study also investigated the possibility of using pure biofuel in an unmodified naturally aspirated diesel engine. The outcome of this study showed that adding hexanol at 10 % and 20 % (by volume) to <b>cashew</b> <b>nut</b> shell biodiesel results in a reduction in emissions. In addition, a significant improvement in brake thermal efficiency and reduction in brake-specific fuel consumptions were achieved. Hence, it could be concluded that hexanol could be a viable and promising additive for improving the drawbacks of biodiesel when it was used to fuel an unmodified diesel engine.|$|R
