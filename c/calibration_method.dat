50|$|Fixed point calibration: is {{used for}} the highest-accuracy {{calibrations}} by national metrology laboratories. It uses the triple point, freezing point or melting point of pure substances such as water, zinc, tin, and argon to generate a known and repeatable temperature. These cells allow the user to reproduce actual conditions of the ITS-90 temperature scale. Fixed-point calibrations provide extremely accurate calibrations (within ±0.001 °C). A common fixed-point <b>calibration</b> <b>method</b> for industrial-grade probes is the ice bath. The equipment is inexpensive, easy to use, and can accommodate several sensors at once. The ice point is designated as a secondary standard because its accuracy is ±0.005 °C (±0.009 °F), compared to ±0.001 °C (±0.0018 °F) for primary fixed points.|$|E

50|$|During retrodialysis, the {{microdialysis}} probe is perfused with an analyte-containing {{solution and}} {{the disappearance of}} drug from the probe is monitored. The recovery for this method can be computed as the ratio of drug lost during passage (Cin−Cout) and drug entering the microdialysis probe (Cin). In principle, retrodialysis can be performed using either the analyte itself (retrodialysis by drug) or a reference compound (retrodialysis by calibrator) that closely resembles both the physiochemical and the biological properties of the analyte. Despite the fact that retrodialysis by drug cannot be used for endogenous compounds as it requires absence of analyte from the sampling site, this <b>calibration</b> <b>method</b> is most commonly used for exogenous compounds in clinical settings.|$|E

However, univariate model predictions for unknown samples are only reliable if the signal is sufficiently selective for the analyte of interest.

50|$|It all {{happened}} {{at the time of}} introduction of digital radiology systems on a mass scale, which in essence eliminated film from the hospital environment, creating the need for digital templating. Unfortunately, eliminating film creates a major flaw when viewing the digital images on a variety of viewing formats.

The first calibration device has been introduced into the market by Zimmer corporation which consisted of an acrylic bar with two embedded steel balls. Ehud Atoun MD designed the first device using a spherical marker on a base which could be placed next to or even under a patient.

5000|$|Zhang model [...] is {{a camera}} <b>calibration</b> <b>method</b> that uses {{traditional}} calibration techniques (known calibration points) and self-calibration techniques (correspondence between the calibration points {{when they are}} in different positions). To perform a full calibration by the Zhang method at least three different images of the calibration target/gauge are required, either by moving the gauge or the camera itself. If some of the intrinsic parameters are given as data (orthogonality of the image or optical center coordinates) the number of images required can be reduced to two. In a first step, an approximation of the estimated projection matrix [...] between the calibration target and the image plane is determined using DLT method.

5000|$|Due to the {{constant}} perfusion of the microdialysis probe with fresh perfusate, a total equilibrium cannot be established. This results in dialysate concentrations that are lower than those measured at the distant sampling site. In order to correlate concentrations measured in the dialysate with those present at the distant sampling site, a calibration factor (recovery) is needed. The recovery can be determined at steady-state using {{the constant}} rate of analyte exchange across the microdialysis membrane. The rate at which an analyte is exchanged across the semipermeable membrane is generally expressed as the analyte’s extraction efficiency. The extraction efficiency {{is defined as the}} ratio between the loss/gain of analyte during its passage through the probe (Cin−Cout) and the difference in concentration between perfusate and distant sampling site (Cin−Csample).In theory, the extraction efficiency of a microdialysis probe can be determined by: 1) changing the drug concentrations while keeping the flow rate constant or 2) changing the flow rate while keeping the respective drug concentrations constant. At steady-state, the same extraction efficiency value is obtained, no matter if the analyte is enriched or depleted in the perfusate. [...] Microdialysis probes can consequently be calibrated by either measuring the loss of analyte using drug-containing perfusate or the gain of analyte using drug-containing sample solutions. To date, the most frequently used calibration methods are the low-flow-rate method, the no-net-flux method, the dynamic (extended) no-net-flux method, and the retrodialysis method. [...] The proper selection of an appropriate <b>calibration</b> <b>method</b> is critically important for the success of a microdialysis experiment. Supportive in vitro experiments prior to the use in animals or humans are therefore recommended. [...] In addition, the recovery determined in vitro may differ from the recovery in humans.
