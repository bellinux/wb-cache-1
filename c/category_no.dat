5|$|At {{the start}} of the awards in 1975, seven {{categories}} were presented: Best Novel, Best Short Fiction, Best Collection, Best Artist, Special Award—Professional, Special Award—Non-professional, and Life Achievement. Only a few categories have changed since then, and no changes have been made to the rules. 1978 saw the addition of the Convention Award, a special award given for general contributions to the genre, and the only award not given every year since the beginning. The Short Fiction award was split into Short Story and Novella awards in 1982, and in 1988 the multi-author anthologies, previously eligible for the Collection award, were split into their own Best Anthology <b>category.</b> <b>No</b> changes have been made since.|$|E
2500|$|Before feudal times, Japanese clan names figured {{prominently}} in history: names with no {{fall into this}} <b>category.</b> <b>No</b> means of and is similar in usage to the aristocratic von in German although the association is in the opposite order in Japanese, and is not generally explicitly written in this style of name. Thus, Minamoto no Yoritomo (...) was Yoritomo (...) of the Minamoto (...) clan. Fujiwara no Kamatari (...) , Ki no Tsurayuki (...) , and Taira no Kiyomori (...) are additional examples. These family names were recorded in Shinsen Shōjiroku. Ryukyuan ruling class used names composed of Chinese characters, usually {{of one or two}} syllables and read in their languages, like Korean and Chinese names.|$|E
60|$|Several very {{elaborate}} patriots {{had taken}} this matter in hand, {{and it was}} now about to {{be presented to the}} house under four different categories. <b>Category</b> <b>No.</b> 1, had the merit of simplicity and precision. It proposed merely that Leaplow should pay the money itself, and take up the bond, using its own funds. <b>Category</b> <b>No.</b> 2, embraced a recommendation of the Great Sachem for Leaplow to pay itself, using, however, certain funds of Leapthrough. <b>Category</b> <b>No.</b> 3 was a proposal to offer ten millions to Leapthrough to say no more about the transaction at all. <b>Category</b> <b>No.</b> 4, was to commence the negotiating or abating system mentioned, without delay, in order to extinguish the claim by instalments as soon as possible.|$|E

50|$|There were a {{total of}} six nominees {{announced}} in this category, compared with the normal five nominees in other <b>categories.</b> <b>No</b> explanation for this situation was indicated.|$|R
60|$|In {{favor of}} <b>category</b> <b>No</b> 1, it was urged that, by {{adopting}} its leading idea, the affair would be altogether {{in our own}} hands, and might consequently be settled with greater attention to purely Leaplow interests; that further delay could only proceed from our own negligence; that no other project was so likely {{to get rid of}} this protracted negotiation in so short a time; that by paying the debt with the Leaplow funds, we should be sure of receiving its amount in the good legal currency of the republic; that it would be singularly economical, as the agent who paid might also be authorized to receive, whereby there would be a saving in salary; and, finally, that under this category, the whole affair might be brought within the limits of a nutshell, and the compass of any one's understanding.|$|E
60|$|In {{favor of}} <b>category</b> <b>No.</b> 2, {{little more than}} very equivocal sophisms, which savored {{strongly}} of commonplace opinions, were presented. It was pretended, for instance, that he who signed a bond was in equity bound to pay it; that, if he refused, the other party had the natural and legal remedy of compulsion; {{that it might not}} always be convenient for a creditor to pay all the obligations of other people which he might happen to hold; that if his transactions were extensive, money might be wanting to carry out such a principle; and that, as a precedent, it would comport much more with Leaplow prudence and discretion to maintain the old and tried notions of probity and justice, than to enter on the unknown ocean of uncertainty that was connected with the new opinions, by admitting which, we could never know when we were fairly out of debt.|$|E
60|$|One night, with a {{peculiar}} meaning in his eye, {{he sent me}} down on deck to invite Tubbs up aloft for a chat. Flattered by so marked an honor--for we were somewhat fastidious, and did not extend such invitations to every body--Tubb's quickly mounted the rigging, looking rather abashed at finding himself in the august presence of the assembled Quarter-Watch of main-top-men. Jack's courteous manner, however, very soon relieved his embarrassment; {{but it is no}} use to be courteous to some men in this world. Tubbs belonged to that <b>category.</b> <b>No</b> sooner did the bumpkin feel himself at ease, than he launched out, as usual, into tremendous laudations of whalemen; declaring that whalemen alone deserved the name of sailors. Jack stood it some time; but when Tubbs came down upon men-of-war, and particularly upon main-top-men, his sense of propriety was so outraged, that he launched into Tubbs like a forty-two pounder.|$|E

60|$|Children, as {{has already}} been remarked, do not require to be taught and trained to eat and drink, to resent injuries, to cling to their possessions, or to run to their mother in danger or pain. They have natural {{instincts}} which provide for all these things. But to speak, to read, to write, and to calculate; to tell the truth, and to obey their parents; to forgive injuries, to face bravely fancied dangers and bear patiently unavoidable pain, are attainments for which no natural instincts can adequately provide. There are instincts that will aid in the work, but none that can of themselves be relied upon without instruction and training. In actual fact, children usually receive their instruction and training in respect {{to some of these}} things incidentally--as it happens--by the rough knocks and frictions, and various painful experiences which they encounter {{in the early years of}} life. In respect to others, the guidance and aid afforded them is more direct and systematic. Unfortunately the establishment in their minds of the principle of obedience comes ordinarily under the former <b>category.</b> <b>No</b> systematic and appropriate efforts are made by the parent to implant it. It is left to the uncertain and fitful influences of accident--to remonstrances, reproaches, and injunctions called forth under sudden excitement in the various emergencies of domestic discipline, and to other means, vague, capricious, and uncertain, and having no wise adaptedness to the attainment of the end in view.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Category</b> <b>No.</b> 3, was {{discussed}} on {{an entirely new}} system of logic, which appeared to have great favor with that class of the members who were of the more refined school of ethics. These orators referred the whole matter to a sentiment of honor. They commenced by drawing vivid pictures of the outrages in which the original wrongs had been committed. They spoke of ruined families, plundered mariners, and blasted hopes. They presented minute arithmetical calculations to show that just forty times as much wrong had, in fact, been done, as this bond assumed; and that, as the case actually stood, Leaplow ought, in strict justice, to receive exactly forty {{times the amount of}} the money that was actually included in the instrument. Turning from these interesting details, they next presented the question of honor. Leapthrough, by attacking the Leaplow flag, and invading Leaplow rights, had made it principally a question of honor, and, in disposing of it, the principle of honor ought never to be lost sight of. It was honorable to PAY ones' debts--this no one could dispute but it was not so clear, by any means, that there was any honor in RECEIVING ones' dues. The national honor was concerned; and they called on members, as they cherished the sacred sentiment, to come forward and sustain it by their votes. As the matter stood, Leaplow had the best of it. In compounding with her creditor, as had been done in the treaty, Leapthrough lost some honor--in refusing to pay the bond, she lost still more; and now, if we should send her the ten millions proposed, and she should have the weakness to accept it, we should fairly get our foot upon her neck, and she could never look us in the face again! ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>category</b> <b>No.</b> 4, {{brought up}} a member who had made {{political}} economy his chief study. This person presented the following case:--According to his calculations, the wrong had been committed precisely sixty-three years, and twenty-six days, and two-thirds of a day ago. For the whole of that long period Leaplow had been troubled with this vexatious question, which had hung like a cloud over the otherwise unimpaired brightness of her political landscape. It {{was time to get}} rid of it. The sum stipulated was just twenty-five millions, to be paid in twenty-five annual instalments, of a million each. Now, he proposed to reduce the instalments to one-half the number, but in no way to change the sum. That point ought to be considered as irrevocably settled. This would diminish the debt one-half. Before the first instalment should become due he would effect a postponement, by diminishing the instalments again to six, referring the time to the latest periods named in the last treaty, and always most sacredly keeping the sums precisely the same. It would be impossible to touch the sums, which, he repeated, ought to be considered as sacred. Before the expiration of the first seven years, a new arrangement might reduce the instalments to two, or even to one--always respecting the sum; and finally, at the proper moment, a treaty could be concluded, declaring {{that there should be no}} instalment at all, reserving the point, that if there HAD been an instalment, Leaplow could never have consented to reduce it below one million. The result would be that in about five-and-twenty years the country would be fairly rid of the matter, and the national character, which it was agreed on all hands was even now as high as it well could be, would probably be raised many degrees higher. The negotiations had commenced in a spirit of compromise; and our character for consistency required that this spirit of compromise should continue to govern our conduct as long as a single farthing remained unpaid.|$|E
