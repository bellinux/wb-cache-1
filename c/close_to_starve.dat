50|$|On May 23, 1944, Phillips was apprehended by the Kempeitai (the Japanese {{military}} police) {{after one}} of the messengers she used to contact the POWs at Cabanatuan was captured, interrogated and killed. She was taken to Bilibid Prison, the infamous Japanese prison in Manila (two miles from the American prison camp), where she was tortured for information. Despite the torture, Phillips refused to talk. She was held in solitary confinement for six months and was to be executed for espionage. This sentence was commuted to twelve years confinement at hard labor. In January 1945, when she was liberated from the prison by American forces, she was <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>starving</b> <b>to</b> death.|$|R
25|$|The {{obligation}} of the bailiwicks {{to pay the}} cost of the occupation meant that the governments had to pay the food for the soldiers. The Germans requisitioned food that was grown so it was shared between the civilians and soldiers. The proportion was by negotiation but with the Germans holding the control, it would move more in favour of the soldiers as the war progressed, even so the soldiers were <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>starving</b> during winter 1944-45.|$|R

The area his troops occupied, known as the Barrens, was a zone of poor farmland that {{made it difficult for}} him to obtain subsistence for his army while he waited for Rosecrans to attack him. Ironically, though the Confederates were stationed for the protection of agricultural supplies of the South moving by rail through Chattanooga, they were <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>starving</b> while large portions of those agricultural supplies were shipped east to General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia.|$|R
5000|$|In the East Blue, {{the pirate}} El Drago {{and his crew}} are searching for the {{treasure}} {{left behind by the}} legendary [...] "Great Gold Pirate" [...] Woonan, which {{is said to be a}} mountain of gold; El Drago eventually finds a treasure map to Woonan's gold by killing Wonnan's former crew. While traveling to the treasure, El Drago's men rob the Straw Hat Pirates, who have run out of food and are <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>starving.</b> Luffy attacks them and accidentally smashes their small boat in the process. El Drago retaliates using his Goe-Goe devil fruit powers, sending a powerful shock-wave that completely destroys the small boat and knocks the Going Merry away. Zoro dives into the sea to save Luffy, separating them from the rest of the Straw Hats, and finds Tobio, a small boy who was forced to work for El Drago. Smelling food, Luffy, Zoro and Tobio use the remains of the boat to travel to a floating oden shop run by Tobio's grandfather, Ganzo. Not having any cash, Luffy and Zoro accidentally perform an eat and run and are chained together by Ganzo.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Due to {{the complex}} network architecture, the mobile adhoc network’s {{multihop}} feature gives additional problems to the users. When the traffic load at each node gets increased, the additional contention due its traffic pattern might cause the nodes which are <b>close</b> <b>to</b> destination <b>to</b> <b>starve</b> the nodes more away from the destination and also the capacity of network is unable to satisfy the total user’s demand which results in an unfairness problem. In this paper, we propose to create an algorithm to compute the optimal MAC-layer bandwidth assigned to each flow in the network. The bottleneck links contention area determines the fair time share which is necessary to calculate the maximum allowed transmission rate used by each flow. To completely utilize the network resources, we compute two optimal rates namely, the maximum fair share and minimum fair share. We use the maximum fair share achieved in order to limit the input rate of those flows which crosses the bottleneck links contention area when the flows that are not allocated to the optimal transmission rate and calculate the following highest fair share. Through simulation results, we show that the proposed protocol achieves improved fair share and throughput with reduced delay. Keywords—MAC-layer, MANETs, Multihop, optimal rate, Transmission...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{exterior}} view of Mission San Gabriel {{from the sidewalk}} near the belfry, San Gabriel, ca. 1900. The belfry stands about two stories tall and has six visible arched openings. About a dozen thick buttresses provide structure for the wall beyond the belfry. Immediately to the left is a gate {{that leads to the}} yard of one of the mission's buildings. Trees, including a palm, line the sidewalk shoulder (at right).; "This mission, although one of the most prosperous, {{was also one of the}} most difficult missions for the padres assigned there. Located along the well-traveled trails used by travelers from Mexico to Alto (upper) California - and later from eastern United States to the west coast - it was a stop off point for numerous travelers. Many of these were simply weary from long and difficult traveling and only in need of food and temporary shelter; but there were also plenty of unwelcome visitors. The mission was often crowded with the military, whose behavior was usually very disruptive to the missionaries as well as the Native American living within the mission. In 1775, the mission was moved to a new site. This new site was so prosperous that is became known as 'The Queen of the Missions'. It produced more wheat than any other mission as well as large crops of corn and beans. Large herds of cattle provided the means for the highly prized industries of tallow-rendering and soap-making, as well as tanning hides for leather goods. The Native Americans here were also highly skilled weavers and wine makers. Unique to this mission is the mosque-like appearance of the church. This is believed to be modeled after the Cathedral of Cordova (formerly a mosque) in Spain. The church was begun in 1779 but was not completed until 1805. When secularization was ordered in 1834 the mission and all its wealth was sadly taken away from the Franciscans. When, in 1843, the Franciscans regained control of the mission, almost nothing was left. Most of the buildings were too damaged for use, and the remaining natives were <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>starving.</b> President Buchanan restored the neglected property to the Catholic Church in 1859. A highlight of the museum there is a collection of canvases believed to be the oldest examples of sacred art done by native California painters. " [...] unknown author...|$|R

50|$|As {{the protagonist}} explores, {{he begins to}} hear voices {{belonging}} to himself and the eponymous Anna, among others. Through these voices and texts found throughout the sawmill, he discovers {{that he has had}} an obsessive history with an ancient deity named Anna that he had since forgotten. However, the plot is ambiguous from this point; one interpretation holds that in times of yore, Anna would lure men into worship, causing them <b>to</b> murder those <b>close</b> <b>to</b> them or <b>starve</b> themselves at the feet of her statue, and after she seduced the protagonist, he murdered his own wife and children for threatening his relationship with Anna. The other interpretation paints the protagonist as the villain, meeting a human avatar of Anna in the forest and falling in love with her. However, after she left because of his obsession with her and abusive personality, he sacrificed children to summon her again.|$|R
