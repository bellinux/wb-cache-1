40|$|OBJECTIVE The {{preliminary}} <b>classification</b> <b>criteria</b> for SSc lack sensitivity for mild/early SSc patients, therefore, the new ACR/EULAR <b>classification</b> <b>criteria</b> for SSc were developed. The {{objective of}} this study was to evaluate the performance of the new <b>classification</b> <b>criteria</b> for SSc in clinical practice in a cohort of mild/early patients. METHODS Consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of SSc, based on expert opinion, were prospectively recruited and assessed according to the EULAR Scleroderma Trials and Research group (EUSTAR) and very early diagnosis of SSc (VEDOSS) recommendations. In some patients, missing values were retrieved retrospectively from the patient's records. Patients were grouped into established SSc (fulfilling the old ACR criteria) and mild/early SSc (not fulfilling the old ACR criteria). The new ACR/EULAR criteria were applied to all patients. RESULTS Of the 304 patients available for the final analysis, 162 / 304 (53. 3 %) had established SSc and 142 / 304 (46. 7 %) had mild/early SSc. All 162 established SSc patients fulfilled the new ACR/EULAR <b>classification</b> <b>criteria.</b> The remaining 142 patients had mild/early SSc. Eighty of these 142 patients (56. 3 %) fulfilled the new ACR/EULAR <b>classification</b> <b>criteria.</b> Patients with mild/early SSc not fulfilling the new <b>classification</b> <b>criteria</b> were most often suffering from RP, had SSc-characteristic autoantibodies and had an SSc pattern on nailfold capillaroscopy. Taken together, the sensitivity of the new ACR/EULAR <b>classification</b> <b>criteria</b> for the overall cohort was 242 / 304 (79. 6 %) compared with 162 / 304 (53. 3 %) for the ACR criteria. CONCLUSION In this cohort with a focus on mild/early SSc, the new ACR/EULAR <b>classification</b> <b>criteria</b> showed higher sensitivity and classified more patients as definite SSc patients than the ACR criteria...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{systemic}} vasculitides are {{a heterogeneous}} group of diseases with inflammation {{of blood vessels}} being the defining common characteristic. <b>Classification</b> <b>criteria</b> and disease definitions are important for clinical studies and therapeutic trials, but have a very limited role in clinical practice.

40|$|Consider {{a set of}} N objects, {{consisting}} of Ni objects originating from population Ai, i = 1, [...] ., k, so that N = Zf-, Ni. In order to classify the set of N objects, we measure a variable with pdf A for objects originating from population Ai. Let x 1,x 2; [...] ,x, be the measured values of the N objects, which {{are assumed to be}} independent. Now consider the N-tuple Gi = (gljt g 2 j, * * ’ 3 Sp ’ ’ ’, gNj), indicating that the object with measured value xi originates from population A,, with gU E { 1, 2, * * f,k} for i = 1, 2, * * a, N. The number of elements in Gj with value I is equal to N, (I = $ 2, + [...] , k). A possible classification of the set of N objects can be represented by the N-tuple C=(C*,C~;~ ~,ci;. *, cN), where ci E { 1, 2, [...] ., k}, indicating that the object with measured value xi is allocated to class ci (there is no restriction on the number of elements in C with a specific value). We find for the mean number of misallocations, given the measured values x,, x 2, [...] .,x,, according to C i=l where A(C, Gj) is the number of misallocations given Gj, N, equals the number of permutations of G, and P (G.) = 1 /N,.
