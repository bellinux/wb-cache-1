25|$|This IFV variant is {{essentially}} a Fahd 240, fitted with a dual-weapon turret that has a 12.7mm machine gun and a 7.62mm machine gun. The addition of a turret requires a third crewman, the gunner, {{but it does not}} affect the Fahd 240's passenger capacity. The turret is the French BTM-208 turret, produced under license from the French SAMM company. It is air-tight, and provides NBC protection. It incorporates and aiming telescopic periscope, forward–observation, rotating mirror periscope in co-axial alignment with weapons, and five or six bullet-proof glass ports insuring all-round vision and ballistic protection. 200 rounds are provided for the 7.62mm machine gun, and another 100 for the 12.7mm machine gun. Elevation limits are -8 and +45, the turret provides 360 degrees of traversion for the weapons. The vehicle has a rotating seat, and an armored hatch for the turret. The machine guns can be fired by means of a foot pedal, freeing the gunner's hands. A <b>central</b> <b>console</b> groups control switches and warning lights governing weapon selection. The addition of a turret increases the vehicle height to 2.85 meters.|$|E

2500|$|Very popular {{accessories}} were vinyl roofs, rally wheels, sport steering wheels, bucket {{seats with}} high backs, and tufted leatherette upholstery (many sedans were produced this way). Interiors were usually black. Steering wheels and instrument panels were only black for many years, as were seatbelts. American style interior color coordination was absent. The {{last year of}} the Nova in Argentina is called locally [...] "Opus 78" [...] (because the slogan of the publicity) and it was the most equipped, adding simil-leather bucket seats, air-conditioning, power steering, electric antenna, and a new dashboard with integrated <b>central</b> <b>console.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On January 22, 1988, {{the next}} Cervo was introduced. Suzuki were accentuating the Cervo's van {{capabilities}} this time around, with a squat, boxy rear end {{which gave the}} car an excceedingly bizarre appearance {{in combination with the}} front clip and door skins of the Alto/Fronte. The C-pillar was very wide, the front part of the roof was made of glass, there was a small wraparound rear spoiler and a more prominent one {{at the top of the}} hatchback lid. One nickname in Japan was [...] "Airbrick", while others referred to it as [...] "Komachi Yokocho" [...] (横丁小町, [...] "side alley beauty") - hinting at the Cervo's continued popularity with stylish young females. The interior was no less unusual than the outside: a large gray and bright yellow diagonal pattern covered the seats while white gauges added a touch of sportiness. Storage compartments abounded, in the thick C-pillars as well as in a <b>central</b> <b>console.</b> A high-powered Mitsubishi Diatone stereo was also standard.|$|E

2500|$|Decking apart, the {{fuselage}} was a conventional spruce and plywood rectangular box structure, though wide at 42 in (1.066 m) {{even for a}} side-by-side seater. External longitudinal stiffeners ran along the sides. Access to the cabin was easy, with saloon car-type doors on either side and there was generous (10 cu ft or 0.92 m3) luggage space behind the seats. [...] Most flight controls were gathered on a <b>central</b> <b>console,</b> so that with double rudder bars and a T-shaped control column, the Bee could be flown from either seat. The cabin was glazed with Rhodoid (cellulose acetate). The main undercarriage wheels were {{in line with the}} wing leading edge, but largely within {{the fuselage}}, with only about 60% of the diameter showing below. Their shock-absorbing legs were also inside the fuselage. This arrangement had been used on very small aircraft such as the English Electric Wren, but it meant the Bee had a narrow undercarriage track despite some toe-out. At the rear, the fuselage extended below the rudder for ease of handling. The tailplane and tabbed elevators were {{on the top of the}} fuselage proper, so the elevators were split to allow rudder movement. Control surfaces were not balanced.|$|E

During season 14 of {{the show}} (in 1976), the formerly futuristic looking interior set was replaced with a Victorian-styled wood-panel and brass affair. [...] In the 1996 American co-production, the TARDIS interior was re-designed to resemble an almost Victorian library with the <b>central</b> control <b>console</b> made up of an eclectic array of anachronistic objects. Modified and streamlined for the 2005 revival of the series, the TARDIS console continued to incorporate steampunk elements, including a Victorian typewriter and gramophone.

5|$|To save money, many sets, {{particularly}} interiors, were redresses {{of existing}} sets. The Enterprise bridge was reconfigured {{to stand in}} for the Grissom, with the chairs reupholstered and the <b>central</b> computer <b>consoles</b> moved to modify the floor plan. An Earth bar and the Klingon medical bay were redresses of the Enterprise sickbay. The Klingon bridge was a set that Nimoy appropriated from another production. Many blinking consoles were rented from a props company rather than being fabricated. The Enterprise bridge itself remained largely unchanged from its appearance in the previous films, though the floor was repainted from black to grey to make it photograph better. The most drastic change was made to Spock's quarters. Nimoy had felt the previous grey color scheme did not express a Vulcan style, and had it brightened with yellows and oranges.|$|R
