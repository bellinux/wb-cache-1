40|$|Kikuchi’s {{disease or}} histiocytic necrotizing {{lymphadenitis}} is uncommon disease {{that first time}} was recognized in Japan. The etiology of disease is unknown. Clinical features consist with unilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, often with upper respiratory prodrome and associated in some patients with fever. More cases occur in women, commonly under 40 years of age. The involved nodes are usually firm with rubbery, discrete and sometimes tender. Occasional patients present with generalized lymphadenopathy, and rarely, hepatosplenomegaly occurs. Diagnosis has been made by surgical biopsy & histological lymphnode appearance. The patient was a 27 -years-old woman that was admitted in infectious ward of Sina Hospital in 2 / 1 / 2001. The patient had fever since 10 days and about 40 days she had a mass in her left cervical that grew gradually. In physical examination of patient showed erythema of pharynx, no exuda and a mass in left cervical area that was, nontender, rubbery, discrete with size 5  5 cm. Her temperature was 39. 6 °c. Initial diagnosis were Typhoid fever or Infectious mononucleosis. Laboratory tests were relative leukopenia (4000 /mm 3) with 48 % lymphocytosis & 35 % Atypical lymphocyte. She was admitted in hospital in date of 1 / 2 / 2001 with <b>complients</b> of fever, headache and vomiting. For the patient was performed surgical biopsy with initial diagnosis of lymphoma by specialist surgen. Pathologist was reported kikuchi’s disease (histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis). In the diagnositic approach to unilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and atypical lymphocytosis, kikuchi’s disease despite of the other more common cause as lymphoma, infectous mononucleosis should be considered...|$|R
40|$|In Germany {{information}} {{about the impact of}} migration on climacteric symptoms and the use of hormone replacement therapy was limited. This study compared the attitudes toward menopause among middle-aged women in Berlin. 121 Turkish born and 154 Korean immigrant women and 123 German women were explored by a questionnaire (modified according to Schneider and Maschewski-Hintze et. al.). The results of the study from 1999 - 2002 have been compared with the results of a survey from 2005 to 2007 in Berlin of Asian and Turkish born immigrant women and German women to examine the influence of the publications {{of the results of the}} American Women's Health Initiative (WHI) 2002 and the British Million Women Study (MWM) 2003 on the attitude toward menopause and hormone replacement therapy influence. Most of all women regarded menopause as a natural phase in women´s life. Opinions about menopause did not significant changed after the publication of WHI data. Turkish born immigrants had significant more menopausal <b>complients</b> than German and Korean women. Korean immigrant women expiererenced a lower risk of vasomotor symptoms. The users of HRT reported more severe menopausal symptoms compared with non-users of HRT. After the publication of WHI data increased the prevalence of vasomotor symptoms in all groups. All women knew noticeably less about health risks related to menopause, best known was osteoporosis. It was shown that the use of HRT depends on the knowledge about the benefits and risks of HRT. After the publication of WHI data used much less Korean and German women HRT, no change in usage HRT showed the Turkish born immigrant women.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{good reasons to}} keep data and here are three of the best [...] . 1) Re-use 2) Re-purposing 3) Citation. This {{presentation}} is all about why you {{were asked to provide}} CCMVal data to the BADC in CF <b>complient</b> NetCDF and how this self-describing standard enables the BADC to fulfill it's role as custodian of the CCMVal data archive. RE-USE Providing data in CF <b>complient</b> NetCDF allows your data to be shared with other scientist now and in the future. Right now the CF NetCDF common fomat is facilitating the quick verification of data from different CCMVal models with the use of standard diagnositic tools. Twenty years from now the data will still be understood because it uses the self describing CF NetCDF standard. RE-PURPOSING Using CF standard names to describe the CCMVal variables will enable scientists from other diciplines {{to make use of the}} CCMVal data when it is eventually made available to them. The CF standard names facilitate data discovery through vocabulary servers which allow users to find data without needing to know the exact names of variables. Such value added services satisfy the increasing expactation from funders that science data can be used by different research communities. CITATION CCMVal data is an ideal candidate for publication in the new data journals because it used the CF NetCDF standard. Once the CCMVal data has been verified and moved to the archive at the BADC our data scientists can help with the process of publishing the data so that your data can be cited. ...|$|E
40|$|Background This study aims to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy on reducing the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome based on the moderator variable of therapy compliance in an Iranian sample. Methods This was a semi-experimental study, in which 56 patients with premenstrual syndrome disorder were selected using the accessible sampling method. They were all the female patients who had been referred to the gynecologic and psychiatric centers in Isfahan city, and were randomly assigned into two experimental and control groups, each one comprising 28 patients. The experimental group received 10 sessions of cognitive-behavioral therapy. The patients were tested before and after intervention using the screening questionnaires of premenstrual syndrome symptoms. Additionally, subjects in both experimental and control groups {{were divided into two}} groups based on the rate of their therapy compliance (from high to low or noncompliant). Data was Analyzed using of covariance and Cohen’s size effect with SPSS- 22. Results The results showed that the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy on reducing the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome was statistically significant. Moreover, research findings have shown that the therapy was more effective on the compliant group. Conclusion According to the results, cognitive behavior therapy can be suggested as an effective therapeutic approach in reducing the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, especially for the patients who are <b>complient...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceBackground: Supraglottic high {{frequency}} jet ventilation (HFJV) in laryngotracheal surgery in infants with modified jet laryngoscopes offers the surgeon an unimpaired operating field. However, supraglottic HFJV {{is associated with}} the development of high airway pressures, inadvertent PEEP-levels and barotrauma. Methods: We investigated the total lung volumes and tidal volume variations at peak inspiratory pressure levels (PIP) and at positive end-expiratory pressure levels (PEEP) along with the pulmonary pressures (PIP and PEEP) during two conventional methods of supraglottic {{high frequency}} jet ventilation (HFJV) in an infant trachea-lung model without stenosis and with different degrees of stenosis. Results: With augmentation of the driving pressure in the experiment without stenosis, the total lung volume (TLV) plus the pulmonary pressures increased. With narrowing of the stenosis TLV reduced at PIP level and increased at PEEP level. Volume shifts were significantly higher during superimposed HFJV compared to monofrequent HFJV at equivalent stenosis diameter (P 0. 05). The pulmonary PIP was in none of the test series higher than 20 mbar and the pulmonary PEEP did not exceed 14 mbar. Conclusions: The results from our experimental model support the safe and effective clinical use of supraglottic HFJV in infants with tracheal stenosis. Moderate driving pressures provide acceptable pulmonary pressures in normal <b>complient</b> lungs...|$|E
40|$|MIDA is an {{open system}} {{architecture}} for model-oriented representation, administration, and (remote) access to both data and methods in a distributed heterogeneous computer and networking environment. AMBAS-SOOM is a variant of MIDA that embrases two main components: the distributed operating platform AMBAS and the modeling environment SOOM covering conceptual concepts of SML and object orientation. SML models are developed using the graphical expert interface of SOOM. These models are translated for AMBAS and can be executed on the AMBAS platform. Models can reuse existing data and methods distributed in a heterogeneous environment by using the AMBAS Requester API. AMBAS contains an Object Request Broker mechanism (<b>complient</b> to the CORBA 1. 1 specification) to assign requests from applications to services available within AMBAS. These services can be distributed in the whole network. Remote access to data and methods using the AMBAS Requester API is fully transparent to applications. One of the chief design goals is hiding of infrastructural and system specific implementation details. AMBAS-SOOM {{was developed in the}} MIDA project at FAW and forms a distributed environment platform for decision support systems. It allows the computer supported selection of methods, based on a concept for method classifications, derived from the software engineering paradigm of operational programming. (orig.)
