40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) is {{a chronic}} inflammatory skin disorder {{and the most}} frequent skin disease in children. Skin barrier defects {{play a crucial role}} in its pathogenesis. 50 % of patients suffering from AD present mutations in the filaggrin gene, coding for a key protein of the upper layer of the skin. However these mutations alone are not sufficient for disease development, suggesting that environmental factors are also of great importance in the genesis of AD. In particular skin infections frequently provoke clinical exacerbations in patients suffering from AD. New insights into skin barrier dysfunctions have facilitated the development of drugs targeting the sustainable restitution of the skin's physiologic function. These agents <b>could</b> <b>modify</b> the pharmacological <b>approach</b> of AD treatments in the future...|$|R
40|$|Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a serious, common, genetically {{determined}} neurological disorder; with a {{prevalence of}} about 1 : 4000 births it affects both sexes and all races and ethnic groups. The two major forms {{are referred to}} as NF 1 and NF 2, as suggested in 1987 by a National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on Neurofibromatosis. In NF 1, the disease phenotype is more variable and complex than in NF 2. Complications can occur in any of the body systems in tissues of ectodermal, mesodermal and neural tube origin; there is marked variation of disease phenotype even within families. The NF 2 gene, in contrast, only seems to be expressed in tissues of ectodermal origin and its expression is more uniform both within and between families. The recent discovery and isolation of the gene responsible for the NF 1 mutation has practical applications in the field of molecular genetics which <b>could</b> <b>modify</b> the <b>approaches</b> for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of NF.

40|$|For centuries the {{discourse}} surrounding {{change in the}} international system has revolved around Thucydides’ thesis that change and conflict are synonymous as great powers rise and fall. This argument has regularly provided a historical model for major change {{in the international system}}. It remains pertinent today as the rise of new great powers – particularly Brazil, India, and China – have fundamentally altered {{the balance of power in}} the international system. This has resulted in an international order increasingly susceptible to pressures for change across economic, political, and structural spectrums. In this study I argue that as power shifts from Europe to Asia and Latin America over the coming decades change is inevitable, but violent conflict is not. I outline how the United States can reduce the potential for conflict by responding to the changing international structure, accepting incremental change that does not go against the fundamental character of the current order while avoiding a buildup of pressure that could lead to systemic conflict. I measure how effective the American response to international change has been over the past two decades, and where appropriate suggest where the United States <b>could</b> <b>modify</b> its <b>approach</b> to avoid falling into the historical Thucydides’ trap...|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the remote}} sensing related work in hydrologic {{modeling}} {{has centered on}} modifying existing models {{to take advantage of}} the capabilities of new sensor techniques. There has been enough success with this approach to insure that remote sensing is a powerful tool in modeling the watershed processes. Unfortunately, many of the models in use were designed without recognizing the growth of remote sensing technology. Thus, their parameters were selected to be map or field crew definable. It is believed that the real benefits will come through the evolution of new models having new parameters that are developed specifically to take advantage of our capabilities in remote sensing. The ability to define hydrologically active areas could have a significant impact. The ability to define soil moisture and the evolution of new techniques to estimate evoportransportation <b>could</b> significantly <b>modify</b> our <b>approach</b> to hydrologic modeling. Still, without a major educational effort to develop an understanding of the techniques used to extract parameter estimates from remote sensing data, the potential offered by this new technology will not be achieved...|$|R

40|$|Aims. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between selected symptoms of chronic heart failure (myocardial infarction, plasma cholesterol level) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FAAH and CNR 1 genes. Methods. A case – control study involving 155 patients with chronic heart failure and 169 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. We detected SNPs 385 C/A (rs 324420) in the FAAH and 1359 G/A (rs 1049353) in the CNR 1 genes us-ing the polymerase chain reaction and restriction analysis. Genotype and allele frequencies were compared between patients and controls as well as between patients with and without myocardial infarction. Results. No significant differences in genotype or allelic frequencies between patients and controls were found (P>  0. 05). Carriers of the FAAH A allele had a 2. 37 -fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction (odds ratio 2. 37, 95 % confidence interval 1. 36 - 6. 93, P = 0. 01). Homozygous carriers of genotype AA of CNR 1 SNP 1359 had significantly higher plasma cholesterol levels than carriers of GG and GA genotypes in patients (P = 0. 04). Conclusions. The study results suggest a role for allele A of the FAAH 385 variant as a risk factor for myocardial infarc-tion. Genotype AA of CNR 1 1359 variant probably affects plasma cholesterol levels.

Inflammation favours AF in the general population, and there is a growing body of evidence that inflammation also plays a role in AF occurring after cardiac surgery but also in the general ICU. How such a finding <b>could</b> <b>modify</b> the therapeutic <b>approach</b> remains elusive. The impact of AF on mortality is not clearly demonstrated in the ICU, with AF reflecting essentially the severity of the underlying disease. Atrial fibrillation (AF) onset {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) is attracting widespread attention because of its frequency and prognostic significance. In the previous issue of Critical Care, Meierhenrich and colleagues complete the description of new-onset AF in the ICU in a selected population of patients suffering from septic shock [1]. They found that 46 % of their patients developed AF and this arrhythmia was significantly associated with increased ICU length of stay without affecting mortality. Interestingly, they reported a significant and continuous increase in C-reactive protein levels the days before the occurrence of AF, corroborating previous findings on the hypothesis of an inflammatory substrate in AF onset [2]. AF is the most significant arrhythmia in the ICU. The risk to develop AF in the ICU is largely superior to that of the general population but differs with regard to the type of ICU involved. Indeed, the risk is estimated to be 4 % in the general population, from 4 to 9 % in the general ICU and an incidence of 32 % has been recently reported in a cardiac surgical ICU [3 - 9]. How could we explain such a difference? In fact, AF is considered both a cardiac disease and a noncardiac disease. Age, essential hypertension, ischaemic hear...|$|R

40|$|When the Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) adopted Statement 34, {{it changed}} the {{generally}} accepted accounting standards {{for state and local}} governments. GASB 34 required that agencies place the value of the assets they manage in their annual financial reports. GASB 34 allowed agencies to track the current value of an asset by using depreciation or a <b>modified</b> <b>approach</b> that focuses on the preservation (rather than depreciation) of assets. The <b>modified</b> <b>approach</b> requires that the condition in which assets are managed meets or exceeds self-imposed minimum conditions, thus requiring the use of an asset management system. The infrastructure management community assumed that this would encourage the adoption of asset management systems. The authors interviewed several large cities and found that they did not adopt the <b>modified</b> <b>approach</b> and instead used the depreciation approach. The message inferred through our findings is that asset management systems should be adopted because they represent good practice and not because of a change in accounting standards...|$|R

Objective: To measure the inter- and intra-rater reliability of this <b>modified</b> BESS <b>approach.</b> Because of the potential auditory distractions that may be present in a clinical setting, we also measured reliability for distracted rating conditions. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: University sports medicine clinic. Patients or Other Participants: Board of Certification (BOC) certified athletic trainers as raters (n= 6). Intervention: Raters used a <b>modified</b> <b>approach</b> to scoring the BESS to score 32 different sets of pre-recorded videos of balancers completing the six stance positions of the BESS. They first completed this in an undistracted condition, then one week later in a distracted condition as they performed a concurrent auditory vigilance task. Main Outcome Measures: Two-way, random, absolute agreement intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) measured the inter- and intra-rater reliability of the <b>modified</b> <b>approach</b> for undistracted and distracted conditions. Repeated measures ANOVAs tested for effects of condition (undistracted vs. distracted) and also BESS stance position (e. g. single-leg, foam) on the raters’ reported number of errors. Results: For the undistracted condition, inter- and intra-rater reliability ICCs were 0. 93 and 0. 92, respectively. For the distracted condition, inter- and intra-rater reliability ICCs were 0. 89 and 0. 92, respectively. There was no significant effect of condition (undistracted vs. distracted) on the reported number of errors in the total error score or in the individual stance position scores. Conclusions: This <b>modified</b> <b>approach</b> to scoring the BESS is reliable, even when used in a potentially distracting environment...|$|R
