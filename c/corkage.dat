500|$|Because some {{restaurants}} are unable or {{choose not to}} get a retail consumption license, the practice of [...] "bring your own bottle" [...] (BYOB) is prevalent in establishments statewide. Patrons are permitted to bring their own beer or wine to a restaurant that does not possess a liquor license, {{as long as there}} is no municipal prohibition against it. By law, a BYOB restaurant may not allow consumption of hard liquor or mixed drinks, nor may it allow consumption of beer or wine by those under 21, visibly intoxicated, or during hours in which the sale of these products is prohibited by licensees in that municipality (i.e. after closing time). Establishments offering BYOB are not allowed to assess a cover charge, charge a <b>corkage</b> fee, or advertise that patrons may bring beer or wine. A restaurant or other business with a retail consumption license may allow consumers to bring their own beer or wine, though many do not.|$|E

5000|$|Known for its {{extensive}} wine {{collection of}} nearly 900 wines, rare Champagne, Burgundy, Bordeaux, and California Cabernet {{can be purchased}} there. The reserve library includes well known labels such as Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, Angelo Gaja, and Domaine Leroy. As a result, Oceanique has consistently won the Wine Spectator Magazine’s [...] "Best of Award of Excellence" [...] every year since 1993. There is no <b>corkage</b> fee on Mondays for guests who wish to BYO. On other days the <b>corkage</b> fee is $30. Within its menu, Oceanique utilizes an old Polish proverb: Fish, to taste right, must swim three times: in water, in butter, and in wine. Wine pairings are offered as well, and the sommelier helps to pair a wine that will bring the flavor out of the entree the customer chooses. Oceanique offers wine-paired dinners that come in three levels and at varying prices. The first is the Introductory Cru Pairing, second is the Intermediate Cru Pairing, {{and the third is}} the Grand Cru Pairing.|$|E

[...] Such policies are greatly regulated by local liquor control laws and licensing restrictions.|$|E
