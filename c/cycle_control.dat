25|$|The {{majority}} of hormonal contraceptives and conception boosters {{focus on the}} ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle {{because it is the}} most important determinant of fertility. Hormone therapy can positively or negatively interfere with ovulation and can give a sense of <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> to the female.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen was {{originally}} included in oral contraceptives for better <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> (to stabilize the endometrium and thereby {{reduce the incidence}} of breakthrough bleeding), but was also found to inhibit follicular development and help prevent ovulation. Estrogen negative feedback on the anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which inhibits follicular development and helps prevent ovulation.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{epigenetic}} mechanisms can be perturbed {{in different types}} of cancer. Epigenetic alterations of DNA repair genes or cell <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> genes are very frequent in sporadic (non-germ line) cancers, being significantly more common than germ line (familial) mutations in these sporadic cancers. Epigenetic alterations are important in cellular transformation to cancer, and their manipulation holds great promise for cancer prevention, detection, and therapy. Several medications which have epigenetic impact are used in several of these diseases. These aspects of epigenetics are addressed in cancer epigenetics.|$|E

40|$|An {{understanding}} of how the cell <b>cycle</b> is <b>controlled,</b> and how the complex controls that govern entry into and exit from the cell cycle work are reviewed in brief in this article. Cell <b>cycle</b> <b>controlling</b> mechanism is essential, considering this cycle is cell’s program for growth and development. Progression through the cell <b>cycle</b> is <b>controlled</b> by a group of kinases called cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) which are thought to phosphorylate cellular substrate, such as the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene in Rb pathway that are responsible for progression into each of the phases of cell cycle. Rb pathways is one of the cell <b>cycle</b> <b>controlling</b> mechanisms, especially from G 1 to S phase, where transcription and protein synthesis occur. Rb controlling mechanism is through binding to transcription factor group E 2 F. Rb forms HDAC-Rb-E 2 F complex to inhibit transcription. Rb plays an important role to form the complex, so that the transcription does not occur indefinitely. Conversely, in order for the cell cycle to progress to the next phase, the complex has to be broken by phosphorylation of Rb. Cyclin D-CDK 4 / 6 complex phosphorylates Rb so as to improve HDAS. Cyclin D-CDK 4 / 6 complex functions to remove E 2 F from Rb. Cyclin activity itself is regulated by CKI which functions at proliferation, checkpoint control and tumor suppressor. Overexpression of cyclin-CDK complex and CKI function disruption lead to uncontrollable Rb activities. Imperfect cell <b>cycle</b> <b>controlling</b> mechanism will cause cells with DNA damage to complete the cell cycle and become mutated cells. The mutated cells will lead to various disorder, such as cancer. </p...|$|R
25|$|The {{discovery}} of a specific function for DCC {{that seemed to have}} little to do with cell <b>cycle</b> <b>control,</b> the low somatic mutation rate and the absence of cancer predisposition in DCC heterozygotes were fairly discouraging evidence for DCC's putative tumour suppressor status. This caused focus to shift to DCC's role in axon guidance for a time, until one study implicated DCC in regulation of cell death. As the 18q chromosomal deletions were never resolved to be related solely to another gene, DCC was rapidly reaccepted as a candidate. Recent research into the mechanisms of DCC signaling and in-vitro studies of DCC modifications have solidified DCC's tumour suppressor position, and have begun to integrate DCCs divergent functions as both an axon guidance molecule and a tumour suppressor into a single concept.|$|E
25|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{were developed}} to prevent ovulation by suppressing the release of gonadotropins. They inhibit follicular development and prevent ovulation as a primary mechanism of action.COCs prevent fertilization and, therefore, qualify as contraceptives. There is no significant evidence that they work after fertilization. The progestins in all COCs provide most of the contraceptive effect by suppressing ovulation and thickening cervical mucus, although the estrogens also make a small contribution to ovulation suppression. <b>Cycle</b> <b>control</b> is enhanced by the estrogen.Because COCs so effectively suppress ovulation and block ascent of sperm into the upper genital tract, the potential impact on endometrial receptivity to implantation is almost academic. When the two primary mechanisms fail, the fact that pregnancy occurs despite the endometrial changes demonstrates that those endometrial changes do not significantly contribute to the pill's mechanism of action.|$|E
25|$|Another problem {{faced by}} many plants is high soil salinity. One {{study shows that}} some EcM fungi are capable of {{improving}} salt tolerance in a species of poplar by altering leaf physiology. Though the symbiotic contact {{takes place at the}} root interface, the fungus was able to alter such leaf traits as concentration of nutrients and phytohormones, and ratios of fatty acids in order to combat leaf chlorosis and shedding. In seagrape seedlings, the EcM fungus Scleroderma bermudense was able to alleviate salt stress. In the seagrape tissue, there was a decrease in both sodium and chlorine, but an increase in potassium and phosphorus, implying this trend might represent a mechanism to explain the observed tolerance. Another study even identified 22 proteins differentially produced under salt stress of the EcM fungus Boletus edulis. They mostly concerned cellular processes such as metabolism, cell <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> and stress tolerance, with 14 proteins being upregulated and 8 down.|$|E

2500|$|Two key {{classes of}} {{regulatory}} molecules, cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), determine a cell's {{progress through the}} cell cycle. Leland H. Hartwell, R. Timothy Hunt, and Paul M. Nurse won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of these central molecules. Many of the genes encoding cyclins and CDKs are conserved among all eukaryotes, but in general more complex organisms have more elaborate cell <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> systems that incorporate more individual components. Many of the relevant genes were first identified by studying yeast, especially Saccharomyces cerevisiae; genetic nomenclature in yeast dubs many of these genes cdc (for [...] "cell division cycle") followed by an identifying number, e.g. cdc25 or cdc20.|$|E

40|$|A common {{characteristic}} of cancer cells is unrestrained cell division. This {{may be caused}} by mutational changes in genes coding for components of cell cycle-controlling networks. Alterations in genes involved in G 1 checkpoint control have been registered in many human tumours, and investigations from several laboratories show that such alterations, taken together, are the most frequent changes detected in cancer cells. The present paper describes mutational analysis by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR/SSCP) and nucleotide sequence analysis of the genes coding for the p 15, p 53 and N-ras proteins in 26 metastases from 25 melanoma patients. The registered mutation frequencies add together with previously registered mutations in p 16 in the same patient samples to a substantial total frequency of 44 % of patients with mutation in {{at least one of the}} investigated genes. These results show the occurrence of heterogeneous defects among components of the cell <b>cycle</b> <b>controlling</b> machinery in a human melanoma tumour sample collection and demonstrate that the total frequency of detected alterations increases with the number of cell <b>cycle</b> <b>controlling</b> genes included in the screening panel...|$|R

The specific coupling between the protein components of the cell <b>cycle</b> <b>control</b> network and the downstream readout of the circuit differ from species to species. The pattern is that the internal functionality of the network circuitry is conserved, but the coupling at the “edges” of the regulatory apparatus to the proteins controlling specific cellular functions differs widely among the different species.|$|E
