40|$|Abstract Background The lateral premotor cortex plays {{a crucial}} role in {{visually}} guided limb movements. It is divided into two main regions, the dorsal (PMd) and ventral (PMv) areas, which are in turn subdivided into functionally and anatomically distinct rostral (PMd-r and PMv-r) and caudal (PMd-c and PMv-c) sub-regions. We analyzed the callosal inputs to these premotor subdivisions following 23 injections of retrograde tracers in eight macaque monkeys. In each monkey, 2 – 4 distinct tracers were injected in different areas allowing direct comparisons of callosal connectivity in the same brain. Results Based on large injections covering the entire extent of the corresponding PM area, we found that each area is strongly connected with its counterpart in the opposite hemisphere. Callosal connectivity with the other premotor areas, the primary motor cortex, prefrontal cortex and somatosensory cortex varied from one area to another. The most extensive callosal inputs terminate in PMd-r and PMd-c, with PMd-r strongly connected with prefrontal cortex. Callosal inputs to PMv-c are more extensive than those to PMv-r, whose connections are restricted to its <b>counterpart</b> <b>area.</b> Quantitative analysis of labelled cells confirms these general findings, and allows an assessment of the relative strength of callosal inputs. Conclusion PMd-r and PMv-r receive their strongest callosal inputs from their respective counterpart areas, whereas PMd-c and PMv-c receive strong inputs from heterotopic areas as well (namely from PMd-r and PMv-r, respectively). Finally, PMd-r stands out as the lateral premotor area with the strongest inputs from the prefrontal cortex, and only the PMd-c and PMv-c receive weak callosal inputs from M 1. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} and functional development restructuring program in Surabaya due tospace limitation {{has caused a}} development overflowing beyond the city toward Surabaya-Malang corridor. One of regions in that corridor is Sidoarjo Regency. The increase ofeconomic activities due to the development overflowing to Sidoarjo comes together with theraise of labor mobility to the region. Related to the problem mentioned before, this research aims to (1) analyze physicaland functional development growth and its distribution in Sidoarjo Regency during the lastdecade as the impact of internal restructuring program in Surabaya; (2) analyze the role ofSidoarjo Regency in endeavoring to stabilize environment of Surabaya City; (3) analyze theimpact of {{physical and}} functional development in Sidoarjo Regency on the inflow of formaland informal sectors labors and to identify their origins; and (4) identify factors causinginformal sector labor migrant tend to choose Sidoarjo Regency {{as a place to}} earn living aswell as the mobility pattern, and to what extent Sidoarjo Regency can serve as a steppingstone for them to initiate their businesses. The results show that (1) the pro natal population policy held by Old OrderGovernment has increased birth numbers and pushed population growth dramatically; (2) capital investment during the New Order that tend to be concentrated in big cities, likeJakarta and Surabaya has caused huge people mobility to the cities. This inflow of lowskilled and educated migrant to big cities would create new problems, not only that ofrelated to physical, but also to the social capacity; and (3) area limitation in cities causesthe development goes beyond neighborhood areas. The development overflowing fromSurabaya to Sidoarjo could decrease population growth of Surabaya, and on the otherhand, the population growth of Sidoarjo increases considerably. The process of“kotadesasi” in Sidoarjo Regency has soundly occurred because the farmers there haveinvolved in agricultural industry since long time, like shrimp crackers, handicraft, case andbags industries. Based on the results, two recommendations can be oferred, (1) each citygrowth will reach a full period, therefore a <b>counterpart</b> <b>area</b> will be necessary to receivethe overflowing from a fully developed city; and (2) development program must bedecentralized in order to distribute people mobility...|$|E

There are also three less discussed but essential <b>counterpart</b> <b>areas</b> of work. First, operationalization requires not just measurement but institutionalization, including establishing and sustaining a programme of research for action, and attracting and keeping the support of a body of researchers and potential users. Second, an ongoing research and policy programme of human development, and action on its findings, requires a basis of widespread public commitment and concern. Lastly, without rich observation and evidence, each of the required commitment, concern, ethical theory and positive theory are likely to be weak and insufficient.

40|$|Living away type of {{marriage}} {{was found to}} be on an upward trend and more common in urban (36. 1 %) than rural areas (19. 2 %). Logistic regression analysis showed that urban residents were 2 {{times more likely to be}} in living away type {{of marriage}} than their rural <b>counterparts.</b> <b>Area</b> of residence was the most significant factor in influencing living away type of marriage. The study revealed that living away type of marriage was due to some married men being migrant workers leaving their wives at home to maintain their family investments and the nature of jobs that make separation of spouses inevitable. The problem of accommodation in urban areas due to shortage of houses was evident from being responsible for 17 % of urban residents in living away type of marriage. Living away type of marriage was implicated as being one of the causes of the spread of HIV/AIDs. Separation of couples predisposes these groups to have sexual contacts with multiple partners.

Objectives To assess the association between dental pain and contextual and individual characteristics in Brazilian adolescents. In addition, we aimed to test whether contextual Human Development Index is independently associated with dental pain after adjusting for individual level variables of socio-demographics and dental characteristics. Methods The study used data from an oral health survey carried out in São Paulo, Brazil, which included dental pain, dental exams, individual socioeconomic and demographic conditions, and Human Development Index at area level of 4, 249 12 -year-old and 1, 566 15 -year-old schoolchildren. The Poisson multilevel analysis was performed.

40|$|Abstract—There {{has been}} a lot of {{research}} over the years on novel cache architectures to improve cache performance or reduce cache area. However, the focus of these efforts has been on desktop processors and compute workloads. Today, mobile processors represent a significant chunk of the market, and are becoming as complex as their desktop <b>counterparts.</b> <b>Area</b> optimizations are crucial to drive down costs and improve profits in this highly competitive market. Caches, which occupy 20 - 30 % of the die area of mobile SOCs, are ideal candidates for downsizing. Hence, our work intends to extend the Reuse Cache architecture for use in a mobile processor as it promises reductions in cache size with minimal performance degradation. In this report, we confirm that the observations regarding high percentage of dead lines in the shared Last-Level Cache hold true for mobile workloads running on mobile processors. We propose new techniques to measure the utilization of cache lines to overcome the limitations of the original work. Our version of the reuse cache architecture was implemented in gem 5, and the performance was evaluated for several memory-intensive Android applications from the AsimBench mobile benchmark suite. Compared to the baseline model with 4 MB conventional L 2 cache, our reuse cache design with 1 MB data array and 4 MB tag array is able to demonstrate 50 % area reductions, 10 % power savings at the cost of only 5 % performance loss.

40|$|The Restinga {{vegetation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} recent and important formations associated with the Atlantic Forest, located in the coastal plains of the Brazilian coast. In marine Quaternary sediments, the Restinga Forest vegetation is distributed in a gradient from the beach to the Coastal Mountains, showing different faces related to local physical conditions. Aiming to identify geobotanic variations by detecting differentiated <b>counterparts</b> <b>areas</b> identified by ASTER image processing, we have characterized the Holocene sediments on the granulometric, floristic composition, to evaluate the similarity and analyzed forest soil fertility (Horizon A). Through the image obtained by applying the Principal Components Analysis and incorporation of albedo image were selected points of interest. In selected areas were mounted two subprofiles 60 x 2 meters crossed, one perpendicular and one parallel to the coastline. The results showed that the sediment and soil more distant from the coast line are thicker and fertile compared to the closest. Regarding the vegetation, the Una River Plain from the Prelate has high biodiversity and dissimilarity between forest types. It is considered that in a forest canopy with such diversity and small scale variation of the physical environment, as in Forest of Restinga, the possibility of identifying units across genera or families may be more viable than by species, considering also the dominance and frequency of individuals grouped together. However, fieldwork already provided, may permit the establishment of floristic patterns in homologous zones already defined. Pages: 1644 - 165...|$|R
