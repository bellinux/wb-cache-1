25|$|One {{of the key}} {{drivers of}} the IoT is data. The success {{of the idea of}} <b>connecting</b> <b>devices</b> to make them more {{efficient}} is dependent upon access to and storage & processing of data. For this purpose, companies working on IoT collect data from multiple sources and store it in their cloud network for further processing. This leaves the door wide open for privacy and security dangers and single point vulnerability of multiple systems. The other issues pertain to consumer choice and ownership of data and how it is used. Presently the regulators have shown more interest in protecting the first three issues identified above.|$|E

50|$|The {{connecting}} devices’ multitasking {{character has}} a serious impact on the learning ability. Multitasking implies operating on a surface level, which only involves the short-time memory. Using multiple <b>connecting</b> <b>devices</b> as learning platforms is therefore not beneficial.

40|$|Differences in {{the thermal}} and {{electrical}} switching time constants between parallel <b>connected</b> <b>devices</b> cause imbalances {{in the power}} and temperature distribution thereby reducing module robustness. In this paper, the impact of electro-thermal variations (gate and thermal resistance) between parallel <b>connected</b> <b>devices</b> on module robustness is investigated for 900 V-CoolMOS and 1. 2 kV-SiC MOSFETs under clamped inductive switching (CIS) and unclamped inductive switching (UIS). Under CIS, {{the difference in the}} steady-state junction temperature (ΔTJ) and switching energy (ΔESW) between the parallel <b>connected</b> <b>devices</b> for a given difference in the gate and thermal resistance (ΔRG & ΔRTH) is used as the metric for determining robustness to electrothermal variations i. e. how well the devices maintain uniform temperature in-spite of switching with different rates and thermal resistances. Under UIS conditions, the change in the maximum avalanche current/energy prior to device failure {{as a function of the}} ΔTJ and ΔRG between the parallel <b>connected</b> <b>devices</b> is used as the metric. Under both CIS and UIS, SiC devices show better performance with minimal negative response to electrothermal variations between the parallel <b>connected</b> <b>devices.</b> Finite element models have also been performed showing the dynamics of BJT latch-up during UIS for the different technologies...|$|R

50|$|Transport of data {{is a major}} factor, {{influencing}} {{design on}} the largest scales to the smallest of DOME. The cost of communicating electrically on copper wires will drive the application of low-power photonic interconnects, from connections between collecting antennas and datacenters to <b>connecting</b> <b>devices</b> inside the computers. Both IBM and ASTRON have advanced research programs into nano photonics, beamforming and optical links and they will combine their efforts for the new designs.|$|E
50|$|Constant {{engagement}} with digital <b>connecting</b> <b>devices</b> at {{the workplace is}} claimed to lead to increased stress levels and reduce productivity.

Allowing employees to disconnect for a part of the day in order to truly focus on their work without disturbance from colleagues is claimed to be beneficial to the productivity and work environment.|$|E

50|$|Continued {{extension}} of the Web has focused on <b>connecting</b> <b>devices</b> to the Internet, coined Intelligent Device Management. As Internet connectivity becomes ubiquitous, manufacturers have started to leverage the expanded computing power of their devices to enhance their usability and capability.

On most devices, this discovery mode turns itself off {{as soon as a}} connection is established or after a delay (typically 2 minutes or less), whichever comes first, thereby minimizing its vulnerability. Support of this mode is mandatory for access points and optional for <b>connecting</b> <b>devices.</b> The Wi-Fi Direct specification supersedes this requirement by stating that all devices must support the push button method.|$|E
