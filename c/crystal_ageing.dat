40|$|Generally, AT-cut quartz {{crystals}} have {{a limited}} scope of use {{when it comes to}} high-precision measurement of very small impedance changes due to their nonlinear frequency-temperature characteristics in the range between 0 °C and 50 °C. The new method improving quartz oscillator frequency-temperature characteristic compensation is switching between two impedance loads. By modifying the oscillator circuit with two logic switches and two impedance loads, the oscillator can switch oscillation between two resonance frequencies. The difference in resonance frequencies compensates the frequency-temperature characteristics influence as well as the influence of of fset and quartz <b>crystal</b> <b>ageing.</b> The experimental results show that the new approach using the switching method highly improves second-to-second frequency stability from +/- 0. 125 Hz to +/- 0. 00001 Hz and minute-to-minute frequency stability from 0. 1 Hz to 0. 0001 Hz, which makes the high-precision measurement of aF and fH changes possible...|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of the lead tungstate electromagnetic calorimeter of the CMS experiment under construction at CERN relies, among other things, on the correction of the calibration parameter from variations dues to <b>crystal</b> <b>ageing.</b> This ageing will be measured by a so-called monitoring system, but the relation between monitoring and calibration parameter variations is not so trivial, and depends much on the overall optical characteristics of crystal and photodetector. We present here simulations done with the program Litrani based on real ageing data for a realistic CMS crystal with a defined surface quality (optically polished, with or without one lateral face slightly depolished), covered by coatings of various characteristics, from totally absorbing to nominal aluminum or diffusing medium. The correlation coefficient between monitoring and scintillation signals depends greatly o n these characteristics, and varies between about 1. 3 and more than 10 (the optimum being one).

40|$|The {{genesis of}} the pegmatitic {{pyroxenite}} that often forms {{the base of the}} Merensky Unit in the Bushveld Complex is re-examined. Large (> 1 cm) orthopyroxene grains contain tricuspidate inclusions of plagioclase, and chains and rings of chromite grains, which are interpreted to have grown by reaction between small, primary orthopyroxene grains and superheated liquid. This superheated liquid may have been an added magma or be due to a pressure reduction as a result of lateral expansion of the chamber. There would then have been a period of non-accumulation of grains, permitting prolonged interaction with the crystal mush at the crystal– liquid interface. <b>Crystal</b> <b>ageing</b> and grain enlargement of original orthopyroxene grains would ensue. Only after the pegmatitic pyrox-enite had developed did another layer of chromite and pyroxenite, with normal grain size, accumulate above it. Immiscible sulphide liquids formed with the second pyroxenite, but percolated down {{as a result of their}} density contrast, even as far as the footwall anorthosite in some cases. Whole-rock abundances of incompatible trace ele-ments in the pegmatitic pyroxenite are comparable with or lower than those of the overlying pyroxenite, and so there is no evidence for addition and/or trapping of large proportions of interstitial liquid, or of an incompatible-element enriched liquid or fluid in the production of the pegmatitic rock. Because of the coarse-grained nature of the rock, modal analysis, especially for minor minerals, is unreliable. Annealing has destroyed primary textures, such that petrographic studies should not be used in isolation to distinguish cumulus and intercumulus components. Geochemical data suggest that the Merensky pyroxenite (both pegmatitic and non-pegmatitic) typically consists of about 70 – 80 % cumulus orthopyroxene and 10 – 20 % cumulus plagioclase, with a further 10 % of intercumulus minerals, and could be considered to be a heteradcumulate.

40|$|Abstract: Determination f single <b>crystal</b> <b>ages</b> by fission track dating {{analysis}} of zircons (and subordinately apatites) within a detrital heavy mineral assemblage, together with frequency distribution and radial plot {{analysis of}} the measured ages, permits identification of different age modes. Such modes may characterize the provenance of a sediment and assist in defining source areas. A limitation of the application isthe thermal stability of tracks within a mineral above which tracks are lost and ages partially reset: in broad terms over geological time 200 - 250 ~ for zircon and < 100 ~ for apatite. Synopses arepresented of published fission track provenance studies in north central Victoria, northeastern Tasminia, Barbados, the Rockall Trough, the English Wealden, Mexico, Utah and the Central Alps. The ability of a geochronometric method to determine ages of individual mineral grains within a detrital heavy mineral population offers a tool for the discrimination of different age modes, which in turn provides a guide to poss-ible source areas and sediment provenance. Fission track dating analysis {{has the power to}} determine single <b>crystal</b> <b>ages</b> and although there has been limited application of the method to sediment provenance studies, the method clearly has a high potential for provenance discrimi-nation.

50|$|Writers of utopian fiction {{generally}} need to {{set their}} imagined societies either in a remote place (as in Sir Thomas More's original Utopia and many imitators), or in a different time. Griffith was the earliest American writer to project her protagonist into the future to encounter a vastly improved social order. Many successors would follow her example; most famously, Edward Bellamy used the same trick in his Looking Backward (1888), as did many of the writers who produced sequels and responses to his work. The same tactic is exploited in John Macnie's The Diothas (1883), W. H. Hudson's A <b>Crystal</b> <b>Age</b> (1887), Elizabeth Corbett's New Amazonia (1889), Bradford Peck's The World a Department Store (1900), Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Moving the Mountain (1911), and other works.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Quartz {{crystals}} are mechanical resonators with piezoelectric properties. The piezoelectric properties (electric potential {{across the}} crystal {{is proportional to}} mechanical deformation) allow their use as electrical circuit elements. Crystals are widely used as resonant elements in oscillators due to their high quality factor (QF), excellent frequency stability, tight tolerance, and relatively low cost. This tutorial explains the primary design considerations {{to be addressed in}} a design of a simple crystal oscillator using AT-cut crystals. The basic qualities of a crystal oscillator and factors that can affect their performance in a variety of applications are described. The topics discussed here are the compilation of issues encountered over a decade of design and applications for ISM-band radios. These topics include load capacitance, negative resistance, startup time, frequency stability versus temperature, drive-level dependency, <b>crystal</b> <b>aging,</b> frequency error, and spurious modes.
