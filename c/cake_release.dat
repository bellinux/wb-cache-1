40|$|Filtration {{technology}} utilizing {{sintered metal}} media provides excellent performance {{for separation of}} particulate matter from either liquid or gas process streams (i. e., liquid/solids and gas/solid separation) in numerous industrial liquid and gas filtration applications. Sintered metal filter media, fabricated from either metal fibers or metal powders into filtration elements, are widely used the in the chemical process, petrochemical and power generation industries. Applications require particulate removal to protect downstream equipment, for product separation, or to meet environmental regulations. Sintered metal media provide a positive barrier to downstream processes. Sintered metal media have demonstrated high particle efficiency removal, reliable filtration performance, effective backwash capability, and long on-stream service. These filters can provide particulate capture efficiencies of 99. 9 % or better using either surface or depth media. Operating temperature can {{be as high as}} 1000 o C, depending on the selection of metal alloy. Along with the filtration efficiency consideration, equally important criteria include corrosion resistance, mechanical strength at service temperature, <b>cake</b> <b>release</b> (blowback cleanability), and long on-stream service life. These issues are critical to achieving successful, cost effective operations...|$|E

40|$|Sintered {{metal filters}} {{have been used}} for hot gas {{filtration}} in various plants in the chemical process, petrochemical and power generation industries. These filters can provide particulate capture efficiencies of 99. 9 % or better. The temperature for filtration has been as high as 900 C. Along with filtration efficiency consideration, more important criteria such as corrosion resistance, mechanical strength at service temperature and <b>cake</b> <b>release</b> issues are being addressed. These issues are critical to operating the hot gas filter successfully and cost effectively. Concerns related to hot corrosion and strength at high temperatures lead the technical community towards using ceramic filters. While ceramics are mostly inert to hot corrosion environments, they are brittle, and are prone to failure during thermal cycling or under rapidly changing loads, such as during process upset or filter blowback. Metal filters can be designed with required strength at elevated temperatures, hot corrosion resistance and toughness to withstand the thermal and mechanical stresses. This paper will describe the benefits of using sintered metal filters in corrosive environments at high temperatures and relevant industrial experience in using such filters. Filter operation and performance in selected applications will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Two {{methods for}} {{improving}} the energy efficiency of fluidized bed sludge incinerators were evaluated. The first method used paper pulp and polymer as conditioning agents for municipal sludge instead of lime and ferric chloride. Automatic control of the incinerator was the second method evaluated for energy savings. To evaluate the use of paper pulp and polymer as conditioning agents, varying quantities of paper pulp {{were added to the}} liquid sludge to determine the optimal sludge-to-paper pulp ratio. The effect of the paper pulp and polymer-conditioned sludge on plant operations also was evaluated. When compared to sludge conditioned with lime and ferric chloride, the paper pulp and polymer-conditioned sludge had similar <b>cake</b> <b>release</b> and feed characteristics, higher BTU values for the dry sludge solids, required less auxiliary fuel for incineration, and generated less ash for disposal. The paper pulp and polymer did not have any appreciable negative effects on the operation of the wastewater treatment plant. It was estimated that processing and incinerating the sludge conditioned with paper pulp and polymer resulted in a cost savings of up to $ 91. 73 per dry ton of activated sludge solids. To evaluate the effect of automatic control, all the incinerator operating parameters including air flow rates, fuel oil feed rates, and sludge feed rates, were automatically monitored and controlled to minimize auxiliary fuel oil use and to keep the incinerator running at optimal conditions. Although effective, the estimated cost savings for automatic control of the incinerator were small...|$|E
40|$|The {{effluent}} treatment plant at Glencore Nikkelverk experiences the generation of liquid waste from various areas and processes in the plant. Being primarily a nickel refinery, but also producing copper and cobalt, the effluent contains significant concentrations of heavy metals. Such effluents are harmful to the environment. The {{effluent treatment}} plant thus operates to limit the discharge of harmful elements from the plant to the effluent, to allow the plant to comply to discharge limits set by authorities and to recover valuable elements from effluents for reprocessing. This is currently performed by means of metal hydroxide precipitation followed by solid-liquid separation. The solid-liquid separation is carried out by manual chamber filter presses that require heavy manual labour and have thus been classified as a health hazard by the health, safety and environment department. An investigation is therefore done to assess the suitability of DrM Fundabac candle filters as an alternative filtration technology by use of a DrM Fundabac pilot filter rig. The investigation analyses filtration performance while also exploring variations in general filtration behaviour. This is done by carrying out initial filter cloth screening tests in the laboratory to choose a suitable range of filter cloths for further testing. Filtration tests are then performed on the pilot filter, employing the chosen filter cloths. Operating parameters including filtration time, applied pressure and feed flowrate are evaluated. The feed to the filter varies continually and cannot be controlled. It is thus investigated how variations in feed affect variations in filtration {{in order to understand}} why filtration performance can change. Samples from the feed slurry, filtrate and filter cake are taken and analysed. Measurements from online data systems are recorded. These enable an overview of some of the primary particle properties, the state of the system and the secondary properties that together govern filtration. The study shows that the pilot filter operates effectively and through the use of either the DrM N 11 U 030 or Markert PPV 2737 filter cloth, good filter <b>cake</b> <b>release</b> and production of filtrate of equal clarity to that of the currently employed filter presses is enabled. For optimal throughput of filtrate and good cloth-cake adhesion during filtration, the filtration time should be set to at least 40 minutes and the applied pressure to 4 bar. An increase in the pH in the range of 9 to 10 during the precipitation process is beneficial for filtration as it results in a higher concentration of solids in the feed to the filter. Both an increase in the solution pH and an increase in the feed solids concentration result in a decreased specific cake resistance and decreased filter cake moisture content. An increase in the feed solids concentration also results in an increase in the mass of filter cake produced. Further information on the particle size distribution in the solution is required in order to conclude on its effect on filtration. An increased concentration of nickel hydroxide precipitate and a decreased concentration of iron hydroxide precipitate in the feed appear to result in a lower specific cake resistance. It is recommended that the study continues whereby the mentioned filter cloths are operated on for a longer duration of time while also investigating the benefit of setting an even longer filtration time. The next stage of investigation will be to design a full-scale filter such that potential candle filter performance can be evaluated and compared to chamber filter press performance...|$|E
