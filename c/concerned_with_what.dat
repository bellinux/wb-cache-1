However, he later reveals that he was feared as a child soldier—known as —who killed several enemies in a civil war and is ashamed of his past. This affects Raiden's personality; he begins to believe he is only useful in the battlefield and his relationship with his girlfriend, Rosemary, would not work. Manipulation by the Patriots causes him to believe he does not have free will. Raiden is encouraged by Solid Snake not to be <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> people tell him but to rely on himself to face his problems.|$|E

The state's electorate responded by removing her (and two of her perceived liberal allies) from the court in November 1986.|$|E

40|$|The {{criteria}} for delineating 2 ̆ 2 the New Guinea Highlands, 2 ̆ 2 a fundamental category in Melanesian anthropology, are variable, vague, and inconsistently applied, {{with the result}} that there is little clarity or agreement with regard to its characteristics and its membership. So far as the literature is concerned, 2 ̆ 2 the New Guinea Highlands 2 ̆ 2 is a fuzzy set. The common resort to notions of 2 ̆ 2 cores, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 margins, 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 fringes 2 ̆ 2 is an attempt to preserve an essentialist approach but inevitably leads to the same confusion.

25|$|Second-language {{acquisition}} classroom {{research is}} an area of research in second-language acquisition concerned with how people learn languages in educational settings. There is a significant overlap between classroom research and language education. Classroom research is empirical, basing its findings on data and statistics wherever possible. It is also more <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> the learners do in the classroom than with what the teacher does. Where language teaching methods may only concentrate on the activities the teacher plans for the class, classroom research concentrates on the effect the things the teacher does has on the students.|$|E

The negotiating posture is designed not to lay down specific hard and fast demands or to set a deadline, but to produce movement in Vietnamese Government along these lines. In this way we can test and probe effectiveness of any actions the GVN actually takes and, at the same time, maintain sufficient flexibility to permit U.S. to resume full support of Diệm regime at any time U.S. Government deems it appropriate.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Yes Minister, {{there are}} many {{occasions}} when Hacker is portrayed as a publicity-mad bungler, incapable of making a firm decision, and prone to blunders that embarrass him or his party, eliciting bad press and stern lectures from the party apparatus, particularly the Chief Whip. He is continually <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> the newspapers of the day will {{have to say about}} him, and is always hoping to be promoted by the Prime Minister. (Hacker ran the unsuccessful campaign for a political ally during the party's last leadership election - his man lost, becoming Foreign Secretary, and leaving Hacker nervous about his prospects under the winner, now Prime Minister.) He is equally afraid of either staying at his current level of Cabinet seniority, or being demoted.|$|E

25|$|In 1943 Sivatte co-signed Reclamación de Poder, a {{document}} which demanded from Franco dismantling of national-sindicalist regime and introduction of Traditionalist monarchy. This {{was his last}} action within the party executive. Increasingly perplexed by contacts with the Alfonsinos and fearing some sort of dynastic compromise, as means of protest in 1944 Sivatte resigned from Junta Nacional Carlista, though he retained his post of the Catalan jefe. He was also <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> he perceived as Carlist lack of direction, political bewilderment and especially the inactive regency of Don Javier. In a late 1945 document he firmly denied dynastic rights to Don Juan and Don Carlos Pio and recommended that the regent assumes a bold and decisive stand; other documents soon followed. Executing his strategy, Sivatte co-engineered a grand Carlist demonstration in Pamplona in December 1945; the event ended in riots and detentions.|$|E
25|$|This devotion is {{predominantly}} {{used in the}} Roman Catholic Church and among some high-church Anglicans and Lutherans. The devotion is especially <b>concerned</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> the Church deems to be the longsuffering love and compassion of the heart of Christ towards humanity. The origin of this devotion in its modern form is derived from a Roman Catholic nun from France, Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque, who said she learned the devotion from Jesus during a series of apparitions to her between 1673 and 1675, and later, in the 19th century, from the mystical revelations of another Roman Catholic nun in Portugal, Blessed Mary of the Divine Heart, a religious of the Good Shepherd, who requested {{in the name of}} Christ that Pope Leo XIII consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Predecessors to the modern devotion arose unmistakably in the Middle Ages in various facets of Catholic mysticism.|$|E

[...] Angelou, especially in her third autobiography, Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas, successfully demonstrated the integrity of the African-American character as she experienced more positive interactions with whites.

In 1918 the Representation of the People Act granted votes to all men over the age of 21 and women over the age of 30.
