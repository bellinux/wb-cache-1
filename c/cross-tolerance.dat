25|$|The {{effects of}} {{morphine}} can be countered with opioid antagonists such as naloxone and naltrexone; {{the development of}} tolerance to morphine may be inhibited by NMDA antagonists such as ketamine or dextromethorphan. The rotation of morphine with chemically dissimilar opioids in the long-term treatment of pain will slow down the growth of tolerance in the longer run, particularly agents known to have significantly incomplete <b>cross-tolerance</b> with morphine such as levorphanol, ketobemidone, piritramide, and methadone and its derivatives; all of these drugs also have NMDA antagonist properties. It is believed that the strong opioid with the most incomplete <b>cross-tolerance</b> with morphine is either methadone or dextromoramide.|$|E
40|$|Phleomycin {{stimulates the}} {{degradation}} of DNA by energy-dependent endonuclease and exonuclease reactions in Escherichia coli rec+ cells and in recB− and recC− cells that lack an adenosine triphosphate-dependent nuclease functioning in the repair of ultraviolet (UV) lesions. Exonuclease activity is blocked in T 4 phage-infected cells. The endonuclease reaction produces 107 -dalton segments resembling those produced in colicin E 2 -treated cells. These differ from the random-sized segments produced in UV-irradiated cells, or the 106 -dalton segments made in T 4 phage-infected cells. A mutant selected for phleomycin tolerance is cross-tolerant to colicin E 2, and some mutants selected for colicin E 2 tolerance are cross-tolerant to phleomycin. On {{the basis of these}} <b>cross-tolerances</b> and the similarities between the effects of phleomycin and E 2 -stimulated nucleases, the suggestion is made that both agents may stimulate the same nuclease reactions in E. coli cells...|$|R
40|$|In the brain, brief {{episodes of}} {{ischemia}} induce tolerance against a subsequent severe episode of ischemia. This phenomenon of endogenous neuroprotection {{is known as}} preconditioning-induced ischemic tolerance. The purpose of this review is to summarize {{the current state of}} knowledge about mechanisms and potential applications of cerebral preconditioning and ischemic tolerance. Articles related to the terms ischemic preconditioning and ischemic tolerance were systematically searched via MEDLINE/ PubMed, and articles published in English related to the nervous system were selected and analyzed. The past two decades have provided interesting insights into the molecular mechanisms of this neuroprotective phenomenon. Although both rapid and delayed types of tolerance have been documented in experimental settings, the delayed type {{has been found to be}} more prominent in the case of neuronal ischemic tolerance. Many intracellular signaling pathways have been implicated regarding ischemic preconditioning. Most of these are associated with membrane receptors, kinase cascades, and transcription factors. Moreover, ischemic tolerance can be induced by exposing animals or cells to diverse types of endogenous and exogenous stimuli that are not necessarily hypoxic or ischemic in nature. These <b>cross-tolerances</b> raise the hope that, in the future, it will be possible to pharmacologically activate or mimic ischemic tolerance in the human brain. Another promising approach is remote preconditioning in which preconditioning of one organ or system leads to the protection of a different (remote) organ that is difficult to target, such as the brain. The preconditioning strategy and related interventions can confer neuroprotection in experimental ischemia, and, thus, have promise for practical applications in cases of vascular neurosurgery and endo-vascular therapy...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesAs {{there is}} limited {{information}} on the mechanisms of vegetative desiccation-tolerance in resurrection plant rhizomes, this work was undertaken to study the mechanisms of desiccation-tolerance in Mohria caffrorum rhizomes. Fronds of this plant have been previously characterized as being desiccation-tolerant in summer and desiccation-sensitive in winter. Since fern rhizomes are perennial organs, it was of interest to establish whether these organs are also perennially desiccation-tolerant and, {{whether or not the}} rhizomes regulate desiccation-tolerance in the fronds. Ultra-structural evidence using transmission electron microscopy and viability studies using electrolyte leakage analysis showed that the rhizomes were desiccation-tolerant throughout the seasons. Quantitative proteomics analysis using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification was employed to investigate molecular mechanisms of desiccation-tolerance in the rhizomes of this plant. Using a custom fern rhizome specific peptide sequence database, 236 proteins were identified. Of these, 16 proteins increased in abundance while 14 declined, in the summer collected rhizomes. On the other hand, 16 proteins increased in abundance and 20 declined in the winter form. Western blot analysis confirmed the expression trends of heat shock protein 70 - 2 and superoxide dismutase-[Cu-Zn], which were among the differentially expressed proteins. Bioinformatics analysis of the differentially expressed proteins was carried out using network enrichment tools, to identify key molecular processes and pathways involved in the rhizome response to desiccation stress. Results indicate that the rhizomes use different molecular mechanisms to achieve desiccation-tolerance in winter and summer. Potential cross-talks and <b>cross-tolerances</b> were identified in which mechanisms protecting the rhizomes against desiccation-tolerance appeared to also protect them against heat stress, and in winter an apparent cross-talk against desiccation and pathogen stresses was also identified. This study is the first report of evidence that M. caffrorum rhizomes are the 'master-regulator organs' responsible for regulating desiccation-tolerance in the fronds. This role was inferred from the rhizome's predicted up-/down-regulation of biological processes and pathways that relate to leaf senescence, shoot system morphogenesis and gametophyte development, among others...|$|R
25|$|Neuroactive steroids, e.g., {{progesterone}} and its active metabolite allopregnanolone, {{are positive}} modulators of the GABAA receptor and are cross tolerant with benzodiazepines. The active metabolite of progesterone {{has been found}} to enhance the binding of benzodiazepines to the benzodiazepine binding sites on the GABAA receptor. The <b>cross-tolerance</b> between GABAA receptor positive modulators occurs because of the similar mechanism of action and the subunit changes that occur from chronic use from {{one or more of these}} compounds in expressed receptor isoforms. Abrupt withdrawal from any of these compounds, e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, alcohol, corticosteroids, neuroactive steroids, and nonbenzodiazepines, precipitate similar withdrawal effects characterized by central nervous system hyper-excitability, resulting in symptoms such as increased seizure susceptibility and anxiety. While many of the neuroactive steroids do not produce full tolerance to their therapeutic effects, <b>cross-tolerance</b> to benzodiazepines still occurs as had been demonstrated between the neuroactive steroid ganaxolone and diazepam. Alterations of levels of neuroactive steroids in the body during the menstrual cycle, menopause, pregnancy, and stressful circumstances can lead to a reduction in the effectiveness of benzodiazepines and a reduced therapeutic effect. During withdrawal of neuroactive steroids, benzodiazepines become less effective.|$|E
25|$|GHB {{has also}} been {{associated}} with a withdrawal syndrome of insomnia, anxiety, and tremor that usually resolves within three to twenty-one days. The withdrawal syndrome can be severe producing acute delirium and may require hospitalization in an intensive care unit for management. Management of GHB dependence involves considering the person's age, comorbidity and the pharmacological pathways of GHB. The mainstay of treatment for severe withdrawal is supportive care and benzodiazepines for control of acute delirium, but larger doses are often required compared to acute delirium of other causes (e.g. > 100mg/d of diazepam). Baclofen has been suggested as an alternative or adjunct to benzodiazepines based on anecdotal evidence and some animal data. However, there is less experience {{with the use of}} baclofen for GHB withdrawal, and additional research in humans is needed. Baclofen was first suggested as an adjunct because benzodiazepines do not affect GABAB receptors and thus have no <b>cross-tolerance</b> with GHB while baclofen, which works via GABAB receptors, is cross-tolerant with GHB and may be more effective in alleviating withdrawal effects of GHB.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes <b>cross-tolerance</b> occurs {{between two}} drugs {{that do not}} share {{mechanisms}} of action or classification.

50|$|<b>Cross-tolerance</b> is a {{phenomenon}} that occurs when tolerance {{to the effects of}} a certain drug produces tolerance to another drug. It often happens between two drugs with similar functions or effects - for example, acting on the same cell receptor or affecting the transmission of certain neurotransmitters. <b>Cross-tolerance</b> has been observed with pharmaceutical drugs such as anti-anxiety agents and illicit substances, and sometimes the two of them together. Often, a person who uses one drug can be tolerant to a drug that has a completely different function. This phenomenon allows one to become tolerant to a drug that they have never even used before.|$|E

50|$|Tolerance to LSD {{builds up}} over {{consistent}} use and <b>cross-tolerance</b> {{has been demonstrated}} between LSD, mescalineand psilocybin.This tolerance is probably caused by downregulation of 5-HT2A {{receptors in the brain}} and diminishes a few days after cessation of use.|$|E
50|$|In a {{study in}} rats <b>cross-tolerance</b> between the {{benzodiazepine}} drug chlordiazepoxide and bretazenil has been demonstrated. In a primate study bretazenil {{was found to be}} able to replace the full agonist diazepam in diazepam dependent primates without precipitating withdrawal effects, demonstrating cross tolerance between bretazenil and benzodiazepine agonists, whereas other partial agonists precipitated a withdrawal syndrome. The differences are likely due to differences in instrinsic properties between different benzodiazepine partial agonists. <b>Cross-tolerance</b> has also been shown between bretazenil and full agonist benzodiazepines in rats. In rats tolerance is slower to develop to the anticonvulsant effects compared to the benzodiazepine site full agonist diazepam. However, tolerance developed to the anticonvulsant effects of bretazenil partial agonist more quickly than they developed to imidazenil.|$|E
5000|$|Wolbach et al. (1962) [...] {{reported}} that mescaline and LSD had similar effects (although with different time course and potency), that direct tolerance could be induced by mescaline, {{and that each}} substance induced <b>cross-tolerance</b> to the other. This was particularly interesting, since LSD (and psilocybin) are indole compounds, while mescaline is not.|$|E
5000|$|Isbell et al.

50|$|Tolerance to {{psilocybin}} builds and dissipates quickly; ingesting psilocybin {{more than}} {{about once a week}} can lead to diminished effects.

50|$|Patients with {{long-term}} pain will {{sometimes have to}} perform so-called opioid rotation. Opioid rotation involves switching from one opioid to another, usually at intervals of between a few weeks, or more commonly, several months. Opioid rotation may allow for a lower equivalent dose, and hence fewer side effects may be encountered to achieve the desired effect. Then, over time, tolerance increases with the new opioid, requiring higher doses. This, in turn, increases the possibility of adverse reactions and toxicity. Then {{it is time to}} rotate again to another opioid. Such opioid rotation is standard practice for managing patients with tolerance development. Usually when doing opioid rotation, one cannot go down to a completely naive dose, because there is <b>cross-tolerance</b> carried over to the new opioid. However, methadone has a lower <b>cross-tolerance</b> when switching to it from other opioids, than other opioids. This means that methadone can start at a comparatively lower dose than other opiates, and the time for the next switch will be longer.|$|E
5000|$|MAO {{inhibitor}} drugs block {{an enzyme}} system resulting in increased stores of monoamine neurotransmitters.

50|$|These drugs mimic {{three classes}} of endorphins, such as endomorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins. All {{three of these}} classes each have their own {{receptor}}-mu, kappa, and delta. Opioids will bind to the receptor for the endorphin they are most chemically similar to. Tolerance to some effects occurs with regular use, {{a result of the}} downregulation of the stimulated opioid receptors. Cross tolerance to analgesia may develop incompletely and less rapidly, allowing rotation between opioid medications be used to compensate somewhat for tolerance. This phenomenon is called incomplete <b>cross-tolerance.</b>|$|E
50|$|Opioid {{analgesic}} drugs tend {{to exhibit}} incomplete <b>cross-tolerance,</b> {{so that even}} when a patient has developed {{a high level of}} tolerance to one drug from this class, they may find that a different opioid drug will still be effective. The reasons for this are still not completely understood, but are thought to result from variations in opioid receptor affinity and occupancy levels at equianalgesic doses, as well as additional mechanisms of action possessed by some drugs such as the NMDA antagonist action of methadone or levorphanol, or the SNRI activity of tramadol or tapentadol.|$|E
50|$|This section {{provides}} a methodological overview, {{as well as}} descriptions of some of Isbell's published drug research (usually summarized from the original research articles). Areas of interest described in the published work include physical and psychological effects of individual substances (including potential for dependence and addiction), ways to mitigate withdrawal symptoms (e.g., methadone therapy), the development of reliable rating methods and questionnaires for subjective drug effects (the Addiction Research Center Inventory), cross-drug comparisons, drug tolerance, and classification of drug groups (based on both the physiological and the subjective effects of a drug, {{as well as its}} <b>cross-tolerance</b> with other drugs).|$|E
5000|$|Nitrogen {{narcosis}} is {{also called}} “L’ivresse des grandes profondeurs” or [...] "rapture of the deep". Nitrogen comprises 79% of the air, but at surface pressures {{it has no}} sedating effect. At greater depths, however, nitrogen affects the brain {{in the same way}} as nitrous oxide (also known as laughing gas) and other anaesthetic gases. The effect is similar to the effects of alcohol, and to some extent there is <b>cross-tolerance.</b> Unlike alcohol, the onset and disappearance are near instantaneous. A diver may be quite clear-headed at 20 meters, and yet giddy and silly at 30 meters. Ascending to 20 meters will almost instantly clear the head.|$|E
50|$|Relative to morphine, {{levorphanol}} lacks complete <b>cross-tolerance</b> and possesses greater intrinsic {{activity at}} the MOR. The duration of action is generally long compared to other comparable analgesics and varies from 4 hours {{to as much as}} 15 hours. For this reason levorphanol is useful in palliation of chronic pain and similar conditions. Levorphanol has an oral to parenteral effectiveness ratio of 2:1, one of the most favorable of the strong narcotics. Its antagonism of the NMDA receptor, {{similar to those of the}} phenylheptylamine open-chain opioids such as methadone or the phenylpiperidine ketobemidone, make levorphanol useful for types of pain that other analgesics may not be as effective against, such as neuropathic pain. Levorphanol's exceptionally high analgesic efficacy in the treatment of neuropathic pain is also conferred by its action on serotonin and norepinephrine transporters, similar to the opioids tramadol and tapentadol, and mutually complements the analgesic effect of its NMDA receptor antagonism.|$|E
5000|$|Excitation of the GABA {{receptor}} {{produces an}} influx of negatively charged chloride ions, which hyperpolarizes the neuron and makes it less likely to give rise to an action potential. In addition to gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) itself, the GABAA receptor can also bind barbiturates and benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepine binding increases the binding of GABA and barbiturates maximize the time the pore is open. Both of these mechanisms allow for influx of chloride ions. When these drugs are taken together, especially with ethanol (drinking alcohol), there is a disproportionate increase in toxicity because the effects of both occur simultaneously and add up since they act on the same receptor at different sites. Convergence upon the GABAA receptor is why tolerance for one drug in the group will most likely cause <b>cross-tolerance</b> for the other drugs in the group. [...] However, the barbiturates are also AMPA receptor blockers, and in addition interact with the nAChR and voltage-gated calcium channels. As a result, somebody who is tolerant to benzodiazepines is more sensitive to barbiturates than vice versa.|$|E

5000|$|CroFab {{antivenom}} {{has been}} used successfully to treat Osage copperhead bites although a lack of complete <b>cross-tolerance</b> requires careful administration and close supervision during the full course of treatment {{to ensure that the}} lowest effective dose is administered (a lower dose would not fully treat the envenomation, and a higher dose may be particularly dangerous to children, the elderly, and infirm adults). It is not uncommon for opiate/opioid narcotic analgesics (ex. morphine, fentanyl), muscle relaxerss (ex. diazepam, tizanidine, orphenadrine), and broad-spectrum antibiotics to be administered. A few days' supply of weaker analgesics and muscle relaxers may be prescribed for the patient to control pain after he or she returns home as the pain resolves completely within one to three days. Patients will also receive a prescription for an intensive antibiotic therapy, which much be taken until the supplies are depleted, giving the drug enough time to fully treat any opportunistic infections resulting from the bite-wounds or other transmission methods which the victim's weakened immune system cannot defend against. Failing to take the antibiotic/s until the prescription is depleted can cause the bacteria to [...] "rebound" [...] in a new form, possessing a greater resistance to antibiotics (MRSA developed through this process).|$|E
5000|$|Barbiturate {{dependence}} develops {{with regular}} use of barbiturates. This in turn {{may lead to}} a need for increasing doses of the drug to get the original desired pharmacological or therapeutic effect. Barbiturate use can lead to both addiction and physical dependence, and as such they have a high potential for abuse. Management of barbiturate dependence involves considering the affected person's age, comorbidity and the pharmacological pathways of barbiturates. Psychological addiction to barbiturates can develop quickly. The GABAA receptor, one of barbiturates' main sites of action, is thought to play a pivotal {{role in the development of}} tolerance to and dependence on barbiturates, as well as the euphoric [...] "high" [...] that results from their abuse. The mechanism by which barbiturate tolerance develops is believed to be different from that of ethanol or benzodiazepines, even though these drugs have been shown to exhibit <b>cross-tolerance</b> with each other. The management of a physical dependence on barbiturates is stabilisation on the long-acting barbiturate phenobarbital followed by a gradual titration down of dose. The slowly eliminated phenobarbital lessens the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and reduces the chances of serious barbiturate withdrawal effects such as seizures. Antipsychotics are not recommended for barbiturate withdrawal (or other CNS depressant withdrawal states) especially clozapine, olanzapine or low potency phenothiazines e.g. chlorpromazine as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects; if used extreme caution is required.|$|E
50|$|Delirium {{has been}} noted from {{discontinuation}} from clorazepate A benzodiazepine dependence occurs in approximately one third of patients who take benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, which is characterised by a withdrawal syndrome upon dose reduction. When used for seizure control, tolerance may manifest itself with an increased rate of seizures as well {{an increased risk of}} withdrawal seizures. In humans, tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of clorazepate occurs frequently with regular use. Due to the development of tolerance, benzodiazepines are, in general, not considered appropriate for the long-term management of epilepsy; increasing the dose may result only in the developing of tolerance to the higher dose combined with worsened adverse effects. <b>Cross-tolerance</b> occurs between benzodiazepines, meaning that, if individuals are tolerant to one benzodiazepine, they will display a tolerance to equivalent doses of other benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines include a worsening of pre-existing symptoms as well as the appearance of new symptoms that were not pre-existing. The withdrawal symptoms may range from mild anxiety and insomnia to severe withdrawal symptoms such as seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can be difficult in some cases to differentiate between pre-existing symptoms and withdrawal symptoms. Use of high doses, long-term use and abrupt or over-rapid withdrawal increases increase the severity of withdrawal syndrome. However, tolerance to the active metabolite of clorazepate may occur more slowly than with other benzodiazepines. Regular use of benzodiazepines causes the development of dependence characterised by tolerance to the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines and the development of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome including symptoms such as anxiety, apprehension, tremor, insomnia, nausea, and vomiting upon cessation of benzodiazepine use. Withdrawal from benzodiazepines should be gradual as abrupt withdrawal from high doses of benzodiazepines may cause confusion, toxic psychosis, convulsions, or a condition resembling delirium tremens. Abrupt withdrawal from lower doses may cause depression, nervousness, rebound insomnia, irritability, sweating, and diarrhea.|$|E

For a total of 91 rice genotypes, including 72 backcross lines (BCLs), <b>cross-tolerance</b> was estimated from the first principal component score (PCS 1) derived from a principal component analysis using a data set with a parameter of chlorophyll fluorescence and cell membrane stability index in both the oxidative and the drought stress treatments as the factors. The higher <b>cross-tolerance</b> was represented by the higher PCS 1, and generally the values of PCS 1 were segregated in the BCLs, suggesting that <b>cross-tolerance</b> is a heritable trait that can be improved by crossbreeding. The effects of positive and negative PCS 1 on dry matter production under flooded and aerobic conditions were tested in field experiments. The decrease in dry matter production under aerobic conditions was smaller for the positive PCS 1 genotypes. However, these genotypes also showed a lower stomatal conductance and smaller shoot biomass, especially under flooded conditions. We concluded that <b>cross-tolerance</b> is a useful trait for improving dry matter production, especially under severe drought stress.

40|$|The {{existence}} of common defence systems to combat stresswas first inferred from simple observations that plantsresistant to one stress {{are often more}} resistant to others.
