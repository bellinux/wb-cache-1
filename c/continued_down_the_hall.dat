25|$|One day, Léon meets Mathilda Lando (Portman), {{a lonely}} 12-year-old girl. Mathilda {{lives with her}} {{dysfunctional}} family in an apartment <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> and has stopped attending class at her school for troubled girls. Mathilda's abusive father (Michael Badalucco) attracts the ire of corrupt DEA agents, who have been paying him to stash cocaine in his apartment. After they discover he has been cutting the cocaine to keep for himself, DEAagents storm the building, led by sharply dressed drug addict Norman Stansfield (Oldman). During the raid, Stansfield quickly becomes unhinged and murders Mathilda's entire family while she is out shopping for groceries. When Mathilda returns, she realizes what has happened {{just in time to}} <b>continue</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> to Léon's apartment, who hesitantly gives her shelter.|$|R
50|$|Kilmer's lack {{of concern}} for players continues, {{resulting}} in a dramatic collapse of Billy Bob (Ron Lester), who had suffered a head injury weeks earlier. When Wendell Brown (Eliel Swinton), another friend of Mox's, is injured on the field during {{the final game of}} the season, Kilmer pressures him to take a shot of cortisone to deaden the pain from his injury, allowing him to continue {{even in the face of}} a permanent injury. Desperate to be recruited by a good college, he grants his consent. At this moment, Mox tells Kilmer he'll quit the team if the needle enters Wendell's knee. Undaunted, he orders Charlie Tweeder (Scott Caan), a friend of both Mox and Wendell, to replace Mox, but he refuses. Mox tells Kilmer that the only way they will return to the field is without him. Realizing that he will be forced to forfeit the game, he loses control and physically assaults Mox. The other players intercede and then refuse to take to the field. Knowing his loss of control has cost him his credibility, Kilmer tries in vain to rally support and spark the team's spirit into trusting him, but none of the players follow him out of the locker room. He <b>continues</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> and seeing no one following him, he turns the other direction and into his office. After a rallying speech from Mox the team instead takes the field under the leadership of Lance, replacing Kilmer as coach for the second half, and manage to win the game.|$|R
