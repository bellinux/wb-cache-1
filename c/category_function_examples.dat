Holistic stem 1 typically refers to the most general manifestation of a root, whereas holistic stems 2 and 3 typically refer to more specific manifestations associated with the root. Each holistic stem has two complementary stems associated with it, which refer to the complementary concepts related to the holistic stem. The specific meaning of complementary stems depends somewhat on the root. These are derived from the word roots by prefixing a vowel or diphthong that also indicates the grammatical <b>category</b> <b>function.</b> Two <b>examples</b> are given in the tables below: ...|$|R

40|$|With the {{recognition}} of the importance of computational approach for protein-protein interaction prediction, many techniques have been developed to computationally predict protein-protein interactions. However, few techniques are actually implemented and announced in service form for general users to readily access and use the techniques. In this paper, we design and implement a protein interaction prediction service system based on the domain combination based protein-protein interaction prediction technique, which is known to show superior accuracy to other conventional computational protein-protein interaction prediction methods. In the prediction accuracy test of the method, high sensitivity (77 %) and specificity (95 %) are achieved for test protein pairs containing common domains with learning sets of proteins in a Yeast. The stability of the method is also manifested through the testing over DIP CORE, HMS-PCI, and TAP data. The functions of the system are divided into core, subsidiary, and general service <b>function</b> <b>categories.</b> The core <b>function</b> <b>category</b> includes the <b>functions</b> that can be provided only by using the domain combination based protein-protein interaction prediction method. Interaction prediction for a single protein pair and visualization of interaction probability distributions are the <b>functions</b> in this <b>category.</b> The subsidiary <b>function</b> <b>category</b> includes the <b>functions</b> that can be derived from the core functions.
