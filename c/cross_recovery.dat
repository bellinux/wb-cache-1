The soft information exchanged between two convolutional decoders are reinforced both by channel coded parity and video compression syntactical information.

The paper continues to propose algorithms to deduce the correct values for selected fields in the compressed stream. Modifying the turbo extrinsic information using these corrections act as reinforcements in the turbo decoding iterative process. The optimal number of turbo iterations suitable for the proposed system model is derived using EXIT charts. Simulation results reveal that a transmission power saving of 2. 28 % can be achieved using the proposed methodology. Contrary to typical joint cross layer decoding schemes, the additional resource requirement is minimal since the proposed decoding cycle does not involve the decompression function...|$|R

40|$|Global Positioning Systems (GPS) is {{undergoing}} stunning changes and upgrades which {{will enhance the}} Civil and Military users. This modernization included new satellite signals for Civil and Military purposes which benefits the fundamental signal acquisition and tracking of the GPS receiver. These new signals enable a new family of alternatives for mitigating the ionospheric errors that currently limit the GPS accuracy [16]. A new Civil signal L 2 Civil (L 2 C) was commissioned on the L 2 frequency which could have ionospheric error elimination capability, with better <b>cross</b> correlation, Data <b>recovery</b> performance, and threshold tracking. The complex structure of the signal calls for new Acquisition approaches which are implementable with limited computational burden. This thesis proposes an Acquisition methodology to acquire the Code phase offset and Carrier frequency offset of the L 2 C signal which can be implemented in real time. The algorithm employs a serial code search for Code Phase by retaining the original sampling frequency `fs 2 ̆ 7 and implements a FFT search for carrier frequency offset with a reduced sampling frequency of `fs/M 2 ̆ 7 where `M 2 ̆ 7 is the decimation rate. Multirate Filters are employed for reducing the sampling frequency. After the Acquisition is performed, the values are passed onto the Phase Lock Loop (PLL) and Delay Lock Loop (DLL) to further synchronize the Code Phase and Carrier frequency. The algorithm was tested on a real data set for the performance evaluation of Acquisition and Tracking, and the navigation bits were extracted and the results discussed...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{explore and}} inform current water {{immersion}} recovery practice of high performance athletes; and to compare recovery interventions of 5 minutes cold water immersion, warm water immersion and passive rest, in trained subjects, following intense exercise replicating {{the demands of}} game-sports. Methods: Study 1 : In a repeated measures design, a measurement approach {{for use in the}} evaluation of water immersion efficacy was piloted. The within-day and between-day reliability of surface electromyelography (sEMG), particularly functional wavelet analysis, was evaluated in human lower limb muscles. Functional wavelet analysis provides the opportunity to measure neuromuscular function at the greatest level of detail by differentiating the relative intensity of low and high frequency motor unit recruitment. On 2 consecutive days (Trial 1 & Trial 2), 12 participants performed 3 x 5 second isometric 80 % maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) on a Biodex® dynamometer in each of 150 ankle plantarflexion, 200 knee extension and 200 knee flexion. sEMG was obtained from the medial gastrocnemius (MG), vastis medialis (VM), vastis lateralis (VL) and biceps femoris (BF) muscles. Joint position and force production were controlled. Electrodes remained in situ during each trial. Electrodes were removed upon completion of Trial 1 and replaced in the same position the next day for Trial 2. Simultaneous sEMG metrics for intervals of consistent force production were compared between contractions in Trial 1 and Trial 2 (between-day) and contractions within Trial 2 (within-day). Study 2 : 11 trained participants completed the 90 minute Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Test (LIST). Five minutes of COLD water immersion (8. 8 ± 0. 30 C), WARM water immersion (35. 1 ± 1. 80 C) and REST were compared in a repeated measures randomised <b>cross</b> over design. <b>Recovery</b> was evaluated at 2, 4 and 24 hours post exercise using circulating markers of muscle damage, muscle dynamometry, drop jump and repeated single leg hop performance tests and perceived recovery. Study 3 : Current water immersion practice of high performance athletes, practice implications stemming from this study’s findings, and the rationale were explored. In a purposive, theoretical sampling approach of expert consultation, 8 professionals advising internationally competing athletes on water immersion recovery practice were provided with a research brief of this project in advance of a scribed, semi-structured interview. Participants were of Sports Coach, Strength & Conditioning Coach and Sports Physiotherapist professions with a minimum of 5 years’ experience working with internationally competing athletes; and differed in international location and sporting disciplines.

40|$|High {{performance}} buildings typically {{relies on}} extreme envelope performances {{in terms of}} insulation level, solar gains valorization and airtightness. The energy needs are limited and the system sizing is reduced to increase the recourse to renewable energy sources. The only exception to this trend {{is related to the}} ventilation, which is even more crucial because of the infiltration control. Mechanical ventilation is a common option to ensure an appropriate ventilation rate and a suitable indoor air quality. Heat recovery devices are widely used to save energy in buildings mechanical ventilation systems. Their contribution in the design or operating phases is typically assessed in terms of effectiveness, which expresses the ratio between the amount of energy â€“ sensible and/or total â€“ actually recovered and the maximum recoverable under ideal configuration. However the effectiveness of recovery devices is not a constant value and depends on the operating â€“ outdoor and indoor â€“conditions and control strategy. In order to evaluate the energy and cost savings allowed by heat recovery systems, these aspects have to be considered, and their relative impact on different heat recovery technologies accounted for. In this work, some of them are analyzed in detail and their contribution to the device effectiveness is discussed. The objective is to understand the influence of the air conditions (fresh and exhaust) on the energy savings considering different sensible and total heat recovery devices and operative constraints which could affect the control strategy. The analysis starts from hourly weather data, representative of different climate types, to quantify the actual effectiveness of different heat recovery systems. The impact of indoor conditions on the sensible and latent recovery is analyzed, defining appropriate control strategies to prevent excessive moisture recovery and discomfort issues when the indoor humidity is considered. Moreover, the effect of condensation and frosting on the hourly and annual performance of each kind of devices is analyzed. Three different climatic conditions have been considered. Sensible fixed-plate <b>cross</b> flow heat <b>recovery</b> system have been compared with enthalpy wheels By means of a parameterization of the operating constraints and the expression of the main quantities in specific terms, depending only on the building use, it has been possible to generalize the main results, making them independent of a specific case study, and to compare different technologies and climatic contexts. Seasonal and annual energy and economic performances have been quantified, as well as their sensitivity to specific calculation assumptions, such as the building type, the investment and energy costs, providing a synthetic overview of the technical and economic viability of the considered technologies and a geographic mapping of their competitiveness...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundDespite {{advances}} in revascularization following extremity vascular injury, {{the relationship between}} time to restoration of flow and functional limb salvage is unknown. The objectives {{of this study are}} to describe a large animal survival model of hind limb ischemia/reperfusion and define neuromuscular recovery following increasing ischemic periods. MethodsSus scrofa swine (N = 38; weight, 87 ± 6. 2 kg) were randomized to iliac artery occlusion for 0 (Control), 1 (1 HR), 3 (3 HR), or 6 (6 HR) hours, followed by vessel repair and 14 days of recovery. Additionally, one group underwent iliac artery division with no restoration of flow (Ligation), and one group underwent iliac artery exposure only without intervention (Sham). A composite physiologic measure of recovery (PMR) was generated to assess group differences over 14 days of survival. PMR included limb function (Tarlov score) and electrophysiologic measures (compound muscle action potential amplitude, sensory nerve action potential amplitude, and nerve conduction velocity). Using the PMR and extrapolating the point at which <b>recovery</b> following ligation <b>crosses</b> the slope connecting recovery after 3 and 6 hours of ischemia, an estimate of the ischemic threshold for the hind limb is made. These results were correlated with peroneus muscle and peroneal nerve histology. ResultsBaseline physiologic characteristics were similar between groups. Neuromuscular recovery in groups with early restoration of flow (Control, 1 HR, 3 HR) was similar and nearly complete (92 %, 98 %, and 88 %, respectively; P >. 45). While recovery was diminished in both 6 HR and Ligation, Ligation, rather than repair, exhibited greater recovery (68 % vs 53 %; P. 45). In contrast, the Ligation group exhibited the greatest degree of injury early in the reperfusion period, followed by more complete recovery and at a faster rate than 6 HR. Extrapolating from the PMR the point at which Ligation (68 % <b>recovery)</b> <b>crosses</b> the slope connecting 3 hours (84 % recovery) and 6 hours (53 % recovery) of ischemia estimates the ischemic threshold to be 4. 7 hours. Restoration of flow at ischemic intervals exceeding this are associated with less physiologic recovery than ligation. ConclusionIn this model, surgical and therapeutic adjuncts to restore extremity perfusion early (1 - 3 hours) after extremity vascular injury are most likely to provide outcomes benefit compared with delayed restoration of flow or ligation. Furthermore, the ischemic threshold of the extremity after which neuromuscular recovery is significantly diminished is less than 5 hours. Additional studies are necessary to determine the effect of other factors such as shock or therapeutic measures on this ischemic threshold. Clinical RelevanceRestoration of axial flow following extremity vascular injury is ideally addressed early and definitively. However, in the setting of associated life-threatening and/or orthopedic injuries or prolonged evacuation, the importance of and decision to restore perfusion is guided by a paucity of data. This study provides new insight into the extent of neuromuscular recovery that can be expected after progressive periods of extremity ischemia, to include ligation...|$|R
40|$|Ageing causes {{retrogradation}} or recrystallisation of starch, {{which leads}} to staling of food products and embrittlement of non-food starch products. Some plasticisers are known to reduce retrogradation, {{but it is not}} clear how. In chapter 1, an overview is given of the present knowledge of starch. In chapter 2, the analytical techniques and their applicabilities in starch research are presented. In chapter 3, retrogradation and sub-Tg physical ageing are described of gelatinised starch, as studied with infrared and NMR relaxation spectroscopy. The influence of processing temperature on initial crystallinity and subsequent recrystallisation (by X-ray diffraction) are described of compression moulded starch, plasticised by water and glycerol. In chapters 4 - 6, the interaction between starch and the plasticisers glycerol or ethylene glycol in the absence of water are described. In chapter 4, the interaction is described to cause a strong exothermal DSC transition. With solid state NMR spectroscopy, an immobilisation of the plasticisers and mobilisation of starch were observed. Upon storage at room temperature, the interaction also occurred, but faster for ethylene glycol than for glycerol, and glycerol interacted mainly with amorphous starch. Less plasticiser molecules interacted with more of their hydroxy groups than upon heating. In chapter 5, the interaction between dry amylopectin and ethylene glycol is described as studied by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy. Ethylene glycol was suggested to form intra-chain H-bonded bridges between the amylopectin chains, increasing chain stiffness and increasing the glass transition. Ethylene glycol was confined to nanometer sized droplets, as the dynamics changed from VFT towards Arrhenius behaviour. In chapter 6, the interaction was studied by Inverse <b>Recovery</b> <b>Cross</b> Polarisation NMR spectroscopy. At room temperature, the plasticiser mobility decreased and the amylopectin C 6 mobility increased. The mobilities of the other amylopectin carbons did not change. The interaction mainly occurs at C 6. Upon heating, the interaction develops fast, after which crystal perfection is assumed to take place. Crystal perfection is slower for glycerol than for ethylene glycol. In chapters 7 and 8, retrogradation is described of fully and partly gelatinised starch with several plasticisers. Due to partial gelatinisation, some granular structure remained, appearing as non-crystalline ghosts. These may act as nuclei for crystallisation. In chapter 7, systems are described with a range of plasticisers, increasing in size and number of hydroxy groups (ethylene glycol, glycerol, threitol, xylitol, glucose and for potato starch also maltose). The larger the number of OH groups, the better the plasticiser reduced the crystallisation inducing effect of ghosts in potato starch. Wheat starch recrystallised to a lesser extent (X-ray crystallinity indices of ~ 0. 4 vs. ~ 0. 5 for potato starch), probably because of the shorter amylopectin chains. Wheat starch did not show clear trends for the influence of plasticiser size and of ghosts. In chapter 8, retrogradation is described of wheat starch with a range of malto-oligosaccharides (maltose, maltotriose, maltotetraose, maltopentaose and maltohexaose). Malto-oligosaccharides substantially reduced retrogradation (crystallinity indices of ~ 0. 2). No trend was found for the influence of ghosts. The finding that maltose reduced retrogradation substantially better than glucose (chapter 7), is of practical importance for starch based foods. Malto-oligosaccharides consisting of 6 or more glucose residues (6 residues are needed for helix formation) were proposed to increase retrogradation because of co-crystallisation. The smaller malto-oligosaccharides were assumed to reduce retrogradation by intruding between the starch chains...|$|R
