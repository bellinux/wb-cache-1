Drill cores from batches with coarse network cracks and longitudinal cracks mainly showed greater moisture expansion than drill cores from batches without cracks or with only fine cracks. In laboratory tests concretes with cements with high Na_ 2 O equivalents showed greater moisture expansions and expansion gradients than those with lower Na_ 2 O equivalents. Coarse network cracks and longitudinal cracks occurred in particular under the following boundary conditions: (1) The foundation of the concrete pavement was poorly drained so that the concrete pavement showed a non-linear moisture gradient, dry in the upper centimetres and moist below. This nonlinear moisture gradient lead to expansions and bowl formation and/or bending tensile stresses and tensile internal stresses in the upper area of the panels.

When the cutting depth was 1 mm, the coated tool was predominantly subjected to adhesion and diffusion wear throughout the duration of cutting.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} experimental {{tests to}} examine the vibration characteristics in {{two different types of}} cracks in a long rotor shaft, a notch cut to varying depths and actual crack growth from a pre-crack. The approach was to set up experimental apparatus, develop a vibration detection system, and maximize the dynamic range. Fatigue crack initiation and propagation in a pre-cracked high carbon steel shaft was experimentally evaluated and monitored using a vibration based condition health monitoring method. The identification of the difference between three different pre-crack depths and five different runs after the crack's growth show shifts in the frequency spectrum and modifications to the peaks’ amplitudes. The results of the tests and analysis clearly demonstrate the feasibility of using vibration to detect the change in frequency of a shaft due to a change in stiffness such as those associated with a shaft crack. Finally, investigation was carried out on the fracture surface in order to show the fatigue crack depth inside the shaft. The results show the fatigue crack fracture surface along the notch depth. A section of the crack surface is presented in close up showing the fatigue <b>crack</b> beach <b>marks,</b> and evidence that the fatigue propagated along the artificial notch internal edges...|$|R
40|$|Indentation-induced {{delamination}} of {{thin films}} provides {{the basis for}} adhesion calculations. In the case of ductile Cu films plastic deformation usually prevents a film from debonding from the substrate. Deadhesion is facilitated {{by the use of}} a hard W superlayer, which promotes indenter-induced Cu film failure, increasing the delamination area by an order of magnitude. Radial as well as annular cracking acts like a secondary mechanism in the strain energy release, and can be resolved from excursions on the load-displacement curves. For the thicker Cu films no excursions were observed, though radial cracking took place. It is important to identify fracture events as they occur {{in order to understand the}} system behavior and accurately apply the analysis. An acoustic emission signal is used to detect both the magnitude and the type of fracture events in thin Cu films. For the films of different thickness from 40 nm to 3 microns the corresponding interfacial fracture energy ranged from 0. 2 to over 100 J/m 2. Limits of plastic energy dissipation are determined with the lower limit, the true work of adhesion, being associated with a dislocation emission criterion. <b>Crack</b> arrest <b>marks</b> were found upon the blister removal, and are proposed to represent the shape of the crack tip.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effect of}} gaseous {{hydrogen}} on the fatigue properties of a commonly used aerospace titanium alloy (Ti– 6 Al– 4 V) was studied. The low-cycle fatigue and fatigue crack growth properties were investigated at room temperature in ambient air and 15 MPa gaseous hydrogen. Results showed that the low-cycle fatigue life was significantly reduced in hydrogen, and the detrimental effect was larger at higher strain amplitudes. The fatigue crack growth rate in hydrogen remained unaffected below a critical stress intensity ΔKn E 17 MPa√m, while beyond this value, the fatigue crack growth rate fluctuated and increased with increasing ΔK. Fractography analysis clearly showed that gaseous hydrogen mainly affected the fatigue crack growth rate. On the fracture surfaces, striations were noted over the entire crack growth region in air, whereas in hydrogen striations were noted at stress intensities lower than ΔKn. Above ΔKn, secondary cracks and brittle flat surfaces with features similar to <b>crack</b> arrest <b>marks</b> were mostly observed in hydrogen. Microstructural analysis along the crack growth direction showed that the crack followed a transgranular path in air, i. e. through α colonies. In hydrogen, the crack also grew along the prior β grain boundaries and at α/β interface within the α colonies. Thereby, the detrimental effect of hydrogen in cast titanium alloy was attributed {{to a change in}} the fracture process during crack propagation...|$|R

It is unknown if, independent of load, frequency alone can cause failure in cartilage. This study investigated the variation of articular cartilage surface damage under frequencies associated with normal, above normal and traumatic loading frequencies. MethodCartilage on bone, obtained from bovine shoulder joints, was tested. Damage was created on the cartilage surface through an indenter being sinusoidally loaded against it at loading frequencies of 1, 10 and 100  Hz (i. e., relevant to normal, above normal and up to rapid heel-strike rise times, respectively). The frequencies were applied with a maximum load in the range 60 – 160  N. Surface <b>cracks</b> were <b>marked</b> with India ink, photographed and their length measured using image analysis software. ResultsSurface damage increased significantly (P <  0. 0001) with frequency throughout all load ranges investigated. The dependence of crack length, c, on frequency, f, could be represented by, c=A(log 10 (f)) 2 +B(log 10 (f)) +D where A =  0. 006  ±  0. 23, B =  0. 62  ±  0. 23 and D =  0. 38  ±  0. 51  mm (mean ± standard deviation).
