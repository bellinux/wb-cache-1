5|$|A {{tropical}} wave crossed <b>Central</b> <b>America</b> <b>and</b> {{entered the}} eastern Pacific Ocean on November 7. An area of convection along the wave tracked westward {{to the south}} of <b>Central</b> <b>America</b> <b>and</b> Mexico, and became more concentrated on November 12 while located about 400miles (645km) south of Acapulco. Later that day, Dvorak classification began on the disturbance, and the convection continued to organize. Early on November 13, the National Hurricane Center indicated the possibility of the system developing into a tropical depression. Thunderstorm activity briefly decreased, though late on November 13 the system acquired enough circulation and organized convection for it to be designated Tropical Depression Twenty-One-E while located about 460miles (740km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Operationally, the depression was not upgraded until eleven hours later.|$|E

5|$|Butler {{participated in}} a series of occupations, police actions, and {{interventions}} by the United States in <b>Central</b> <b>America</b> <b>and</b> the Caribbean, commonly called the Banana Wars because their goal was to protect American commercial interests in the region, particularly those of the United Fruit Company.

The U.S. was also trying to advance its own political interests by maintaining its influence in the region and especially its control of the Panama Canal. These interventions started with the Spanish–American War in 1898 and ended with the withdrawal of troops from Haiti and President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy in 1934. After his retirement, Butler became an outspoken critic of the business interests in the Caribbean, criticizing the ways in which U.S. businesses and Wall Street bankers imposed their agenda on United States foreign policy during this period.|$|E
