5|$|Molten salt can be {{employed}} as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant, {{so that it can}} be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995–1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity. The molten salt mixtures vary. The most extended mixture <b>contains</b> <b>sodium</b> nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate. It is non-flammable and nontoxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid, so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.|$|E

40|$|Context: Extrinsic {{staining}} of {{acrylic resin}} dentures {{could be a}} major esthetic problem for denture wearers. Tea, coffee, cola, turmeric, and tobacco often cause extrinsic staining of dentures. Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of various denture cleansing materials in the removal of tea and turmeric stains and to compare the efficacy of those denture cleansers {{with each other in}} the removal of tea and turmeric stains. Materials and Methods: Heat-cured acrylic resin specimens were stained using tea and turmeric solutions. The spectrophotometer was used to determine the reflectance values of the samples and to evaluate the efficacy of various denture cleansing materials in removal of tea and turmeric stains. Three denture cleansers, namely, sodium hypochlorite, Safe plus, and Clinsodent were used in the study. Water was used as a control. Statistical Analysis Used: ANOVA test and post hoc Tukey′s test were used to determine the statistical difference between the groups. Result: A statistically significant difference was found (p ≤ 0. 05) between the different denture cleansing materials used. Products <b>containing</b> <b>sodium</b> perborate along with trisodium phosphate had the highest stain removing capability. Conclusion: It was found that all the denture cleansing materials used in the study were effective in removing tea and turmeric stains. Products <b>containing</b> <b>sodium</b> perborate along with trisodium phosphate had a comparatively greater stain removal capability than products <b>containing</b> <b>sodium</b> perborate along with sodium bicarbonate followed by products <b>containing</b> <b>sodium</b> hypochlorite followed by water (control) ...|$|R
