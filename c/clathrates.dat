5|$|In {{addition}} to the compounds where a noble gas atom {{is involved in a}} covalent bond, noble gases also form non-covalent compounds. The <b>clathrates,</b> first described in 1949, consist of a noble gas atom trapped within cavities of crystal lattices of certain organic and inorganic substances. The essential condition for their formation is that the guest (noble gas) atoms must be of appropriate size to fit in the cavities of the host crystal lattice. For instance, argon, krypton, and xenon form <b>clathrates</b> with hydroquinone, but helium and neon do not because they are too small or insufficiently polarizable to be retained. Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon also form clathrate hydrates, where the noble gas is trapped in ice.|$|E
5|$|Several {{explanations}} for the observed elevated temperatures and the resulting plumes have been proposed, including venting from a subsurface reservoir of liquid water, sublimation of ice, decompression and dissociation of <b>clathrates,</b> and shear heating, but a complete explanation of all the heat sources causing the observed thermal power output of Enceladus {{has not yet been}} settled.|$|E
5|$|Oberon is {{the second}} largest and most massive of the Uranian moons after Titania, and the ninth most massive moon in the Solar System. Oberon's density of 1.63g/cm³, which {{is higher than the}} typical density of Saturn's satellites, {{indicates}} that it consists of roughly equal proportions of water ice and a dense non-ice component. The latter could be made of rock and carbonaceous material including heavy organic compounds. The presence of water ice is supported by spectroscopic observations, which have revealed crystalline water ice {{on the surface of the}} moon. Water ice absorption bands are stronger on Oberon's trailing hemisphere than on the leading hemisphere. This is the opposite of what is observed on other Uranian moons, where the leading hemisphere exhibits stronger water ice signatures. The cause of this asymmetry is not known, but it may be related to impact gardening (the creation of soil via impacts) of the surface, which is stronger on the leading hemisphere. Meteorite impacts tend to sputter (knock out) ice from the surface, leaving dark non-ice material behind. The dark material itself may have formed as a result of radiation processing of methane <b>clathrates</b> or radiation darkening of other organic compounds.|$|E

25|$|<b>Clathrates</b> are {{composites}} {{in which}} a lattice of one substance forms a cage around another. Methane <b>clathrates</b> (in which water molecules are the cage) form on continental shelves.

40|$|The {{properties}} of <b>clathrate</b> hydrates {{were used to}} explain the complex and poorly understood physical processes taking place within cometary nuclei and other icy solar system bodies. Most of all the experiments previously conducted used starting compositions which would yield <b>clathrate</b> types I hydrates.

In addition, the larger molecules which would form type II <b>clathrate</b> hydrates typically have lower vapor pressures. The result of these considerations is that at temperatures where we identified <b>clathrate</b> formation (120 - 130 K), {{it is more likely that}} type II <b>clathrate</b> hydrates will form.

It is argued that non-solar but well-constrained noble gas abundances would be measured by Galileo in the Jovian atmosphere if the observed carbon enhancement were due to bombardment of the atmosphere by clathrate-bearing planetesimals sometime after planetary formation. The noble gas abundances of Titan's atmosphere are also predicted under the hypothesis that much of the satellite's methane accreted as <b>clathrate.</b> Double occupancy of <b>clathrate</b> cages by H_ 2 and CH_ 4 in contact with a solar composition gas is examined, and it is concluded that potentially important amounts of H_ 2 may have incorporated in satellites as <b>clathrate.</b> The kinetics of <b>clathrate</b> formation is also examined, and it is suggested that, under thermodynamically appropriate conditions, essentially complete clathration of water ice could have occurred in high pressure nebulae around giant planets but probably not in the outer solar nebula; comets probably did not aggregate as <b>clathrate.</b> At moderate pressures, the phase diagram for methane <b>clathrate</b> hydrate in the presence of 15...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Ancient {{atmospheric}} gases {{are trapped in}} polar ice sheets. The gas molecules are stored in air-bubbles at shallower depth. The air-bubbles are gradually compressed with depth and begin to transform into <b>clathrate</b> hydrates below {{the level at which}} the hydrostatic pressure becomes greater than the dissociation pressure of the phase of air <b>clathrate</b> hydrate. Air-bubbles and <b>clathrate</b> hydrates coexist in the deep ice {{over a long period of}} time. Significant fractionation of gas molecules in the transition zone of Vostok Antarctic ice has been found from measurements of the depth profile of the N 2 / 02 composition ratios in <b>clathrate</b> hydrates and air-bubbles using Raman spectroscopy. In order to understand the fractionation process, a theoretical model of post-nucleation growth of <b>clathrate</b> hydrates caused by the diffusive selective mass transfer of air molecules from air-bubbles through the surrounding ice matrix has been developed. The studies revealed air diffusion between air-bubbles and <b>clathrate</b> hydrates as the principal mechanism of gas fractionation between air-bubbles and <b>clathrate</b> hydrates in deep ice sheets.

25|$|A related {{issue is}} the methane {{clathrate}} reservoirs found under sediments on the ocean floors.

In 2004 the global inventory of ocean methane <b>clathrates</b> was estimated to occupy between one and five million cubic kilometres. If all these <b>clathrates</b> were to be spread uniformly across the ocean floor, this would translate to a thickness between three and fourteen metres.

Had N2 been released from <b>clathrates,</b> 36Ar and 38Ar that are inert primordial isotopes of the Solar System should also be present in the atmosphere, but neither has been detected in significant quantities. The insignificant concentration of 36Ar and 38Ar also indicates that the ~40K temperature required to trap them and N2 in <b>clathrates</b> did not exist in the Saturnian subnebula. Instead, the temperature may have been higher than 75K, limiting even the accumulation of NH3 as hydrates. Temperatures would have been even higher in the Jovian subnebula due to the greater gravitational potential energy release, mass, and proximity to the Sun, greatly reducing the NH3 inventory accreted by Callisto and Ganymede. The resulting N2 atmospheres may have been too thin to survive the atmospheric erosion effects that Titan has withstood.|$|E
