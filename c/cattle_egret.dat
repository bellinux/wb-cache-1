5|$|The Java sparrow {{has been}} {{introduced}} by humans, and the <b>cattle</b> <b>egret</b> has naturally colonised.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cattle</b> <b>egret</b> (Bubulcus ibis) is a {{cosmopolitan}} species of heron (family Ardeidae) {{found in the}} tropics, subtropics and warm temperate zones. It is {{the only member of}} the monotypic genus Bubulcus, although some authorities regard two of its subspecies as full species, the western <b>cattle</b> <b>egret</b> and the eastern <b>cattle</b> <b>egret.</b> Despite the similarities in plumage to the egrets of the genus Egretta, it is more closely related to the herons of Ardea. Originally native to parts of Asia, Africa and Europe, it has undergone a rapid expansion in its distribution and successfully colonised much of the rest of the world in the last century.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cattle</b> <b>egret</b> has two {{geographical}} races {{which are}} sometimes classified as full species, the western <b>cattle</b> <b>egret,</b> B. ibis, and eastern <b>cattle</b> <b>egret,</b> B. coromandus. The two forms were split by McAllan and Bruce, but {{were regarded as}} conspecific by almost all other recent authors until {{the publication of the}} influential Birds of South Asia. The eastern subspecies B. (i.) coromandus, described by Pieter Boddaert in 1783, breeds in Asia and Australasia, and the western nominate form occupies the rest of the species range, including the Americas. Some authorities recognise a third Seychelles subspecies, B. i. seychellarum, which was first described by Finn Salomonsen in 1934.|$|E
40|$|Abstract It {{was found}} that habitat types and age may {{influence}} diurnal activities of <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets.</b> In average the grassland comprised 41. 59 of all of diurnal activities while forest and bushland comprised 21. 54 and 35. 79 of all of diurnal activities respectively P 0. 05. Variation {{in the performance of}} diurnal activities overtimes of the day differed significantly P 0. 05 similarly the time spent by <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets</b> to perform diurnal activities was different P 0. 05. Activity budget of <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets</b> differed significantly with age classes P 0. 05. The adult <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets</b> spent much time feeding than sub-adults and juveniles. The feeding behaviour was the diurnal activity of <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets</b> performed most often in the morning hours. The diurnal activity patterns and time budgets of the <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets</b> may be due to their strategies to cope with environmental factors such temperatures different habitats and food availability and high foraging behaviour can be due to high energy demand...|$|R
40|$|Regardless {{of habitat}} or time of day, <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets</b> feeding {{independently}} of hosts generally occurring larger groups than those feeding in close association with ungulates. The average group size of three individuals feeding {{in association with}} hosts stays remarkably constant with regard to divergent situations. Based {{on the type of}} habitat and the grazing speed of the host concerned, <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets</b> achieve the highest feeding success (number of prey items) with the least energy inputs (number of paces) in association with cattle, {{and to a lesser extent}} with the closely related buffalo. Compared to solitary birds, <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets</b> feeding in groups experience without exceptional higher feeding success. Results of feeding experiments, as well as the exceptional occurrence of so-called feeding lines, confirm the phenomenon that the feeding success of <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets</b> correlates closely with the size of the feeding group. </p...|$|R

5|$|One species, the <b>cattle</b> <b>egret,</b> was {{historically}} an African bird. In the 20th century {{this bird}} colonized North America {{and is now}} found throughout the lower 48 states of the United States. The <b>cattle</b> <b>egret</b> is the only Old World bird to establish itself in North America in historical times without being introduced by humans. As such, it is not marked as introduced on this list. Neither is the glossy ibis, which probably had a similar history.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cattle</b> <b>egret</b> {{engages in}} {{low levels of}} brood parasitism, {{and there are a}} few {{instances}} of <b>cattle</b> <b>egret</b> eggs being laid in the nests of snowy egrets and little blue herons, although these eggs seldom hatch. There is also evidence of low levels of intraspecific brood parasitism, with females laying eggs in the nests of other cattle egrets. As much as 30% extra-pair copulations have been noted.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>cattle</b> <b>egret</b> {{sometimes}} feeds {{in shallow}} water, unlike most herons it is typically found in fields and dry grassy habitats, reflecting its greater dietary reliance on terrestrial insects rather than aquatic prey.|$|E

40|$|This {{documentation}} reports {{an analysis}} of the diet selection along with the diverse feeding strategies being utilised by <b>Cattle</b> <b>Egrets</b> (Bubulcus ibis coromandus) from Jammu. In the study area, <b>Cattle</b> <b>Egrets</b> were recorded to be strictly insectivorous with the preference of grasshoppers, flies, house crickets, mole crickets and earthworms in the grassland ecosystem and beetles, backswimmers, molluscs, orthoptera larvae, fishes and frogs in aquatic ecosystem. Moreover, the behavioural methods, like walking steadily in shallow waters, running with stabs usually on land, standing and waiting and capturing flying prey from a standing position were registered to be the main feeding techniques exploited by <b>Cattle</b> <b>Egrets</b> during the study period...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the largest}} aviaries in Europe, this exhibit is home to birds {{including}} scarlet ibis, American flamingos, <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets,</b> hamerkops, storks, and vulturine guineafowl.|$|R
5|$|The adult <b>cattle</b> <b>egret</b> has few predators, but birds or mammals may raid its nests, and chicks {{may be lost}} to starvation, calcium {{deficiency}} or disturbance from other large birds. This species maintains a special relationship with cattle, which extends to other large grazing mammals; wider human farming {{is believed to be}} a major cause of their suddenly expanded range. The <b>cattle</b> <b>egret</b> removes ticks and flies from cattle and consumes them. This benefits both species, but it has been implicated in the spread of tick-borne animal diseases.|$|E
5|$|Until 2009, {{the parrot}} {{crossbill}} was an anomaly, {{in that it}} was on the committee's list of species, even though a breeding population existed in Scotland. In 2009, this species was removed, along with white-billed diver and <b>cattle</b> <b>egret.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite {{superficial}} {{similarities in}} appearance, the <b>cattle</b> <b>egret</b> is {{more closely related}} to the genus Ardea, which comprises the great or typical herons and the great egret (A. alba), than to the majority of species termed egrets in the genus Egretta. Rare cases of hybridization with little blue herons Egretta caerulea, little egrets Egretta garzetta and snowy egrets Egretta thula have been recorded.|$|E
50|$|Bird {{species that}} {{can be seen in the}} area include parrots, peacocks, crows, herons, woodpeckers, kingfishers, ducks, Myna/Asian Koel, vultures, <b>Cattle</b> <b>Egrets,</b> Black Winged Stilts, Red Vented Bulbuls, owls and ThenChittu.|$|R
50|$|The zoo {{contains}} {{a variety of}} animals and birds, such as donkeys, coatis, rheas, maras, red junglefowl, Lady Amherst's pheasants, red-legged seriemas, ring-tailed lemurs, kookaburras, sacred ibis, <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets,</b> little egrets, Eurasian eagle-owls and white-naped cranes.|$|R
50|$|Bird lovers have {{constructed}} {{a series of}} artificial nesting structures on a network of small islets within one of the lakes. The lake complex draws great blue herons, great egrets, black-crowned night herons, double-crested cormorants, and <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets.</b>|$|R
5|$|In Australia, the {{colonisation}} {{began in}} the 1940s, with the species establishing itself {{in the north and}} east of the continent. It began to regularly visit New Zealand in the 1960s. Since 1948 the <b>cattle</b> <b>egret</b> has been permanently resident in Israel. Prior to 1948 it was only a winter visitor.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{interactions}} {{between humans and}} cattle egrets are beneficial. The <b>cattle</b> <b>egret</b> can be a safety hazard to aircraft due to its habit of feeding in large groups in the grassy verges of airports, {{and it has been}} implicated in the spread of animal infections such as heartwater, infectious bursal disease and possibly Newcastle disease.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cattle</b> <b>egret</b> {{feeds on}} a wide range of prey, {{particularly}} insects, especially grasshoppers, crickets, flies (adults and maggots), and moths, as well as spiders, frogs, and earthworms. In a rare instance they have been observed foraging along the branches of a banyan tree for ripe figs. The species is usually found with cattle and other large grazing and browsing animals, and catches small creatures disturbed by the mammals. Studies have shown that <b>cattle</b> <b>egret</b> foraging success is much higher when foraging near a large animal than when feeding singly. When foraging with cattle, it has been shown to be 3.6times more successful in capturing prey than when foraging alone. Its performance is similar when it follows farm machinery, but it is forced to move more. In urban situations cattle egrets have also been observed foraging in peculiar situations like railway lines.|$|E
25|$|The island hosts {{introduced}} {{bird species}} from many regions, including <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets</b> (Bubulcus ibis), Indian barred ground dove, {{also called the}} zebra dove (Geopelia striata), turtle dove (Nesoenas picturata), Indian mynah (Acridotheres tristis), Madagascar fody (Foudia madagascariensis), and chickens (Gallus gallus).|$|R
40|$|Field {{observations}} undertaken during October 1995 to April 2001 {{in agricultural}} areas and nature reserves {{of the central}} Free State, indicate that <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets</b> mainly feed in commensalistic association with ungulates or even farm implements. A higher percentage farm animals than game was involved herewith. Based on calculated preference indices only three species, namely cattle, buffalo and white rhino, qualified as key hosts. Eland, gemsbok, impala and horses were classified as major hosts, {{while the rest of}} the thirteen observed host species were identified as minor hosts. More than half of all feeding associations (58, 4 %) occurred during the early mornings followed by a decrease during the middle of the day with a slight increase again later in the afternoon. Depending on the host species involved, notable differences occurred in the time of association. Cattle were the only host species with which <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets</b> associated during any time of the day. Evidently, <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets</b> associated most often with larger host species which were actively grazing. In grassland habitats the birds mainly fed in front of grazing hosts, but behind those that moved too fast...|$|R
25|$|Ring-billed gulls {{are also}} {{considered}} a nuisance, and {{measures have been}} taken to reduce their population. Authorities are trying to encourage the return of black crowned night herons, <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets,</b> and great blue herons, which disappeared during the time DDT was being widely used.|$|R
5|$|The <b>cattle</b> <b>egret</b> {{may also}} show {{versatility}} in its diet. On islands with seabird colonies, it will prey on {{the eggs and}} chicks of terns and other seabirds. During migration {{it has also been}} reported to eat exhausted migrating landbirds. Birds of the Seychelles race also indulge in some kleptoparasitism, chasing the chicks of sooty terns and forcing them to disgorge food.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cattle</b> <b>egret</b> is {{a popular}} bird with cattle ranchers for its {{perceived}} role as a biocontrol of cattle parasites such as ticks and flies. A study in Australia found that cattle egrets {{reduced the number of}} flies that bothered cattle by pecking them directly off the skin. It was the benefit to stock that prompted ranchers and the Hawaiian Board of Agriculture and Forestry to release the species in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cattle</b> <b>egret</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1758 by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae as Ardea ibis, but {{was moved to}} its current genus by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1855. Its genus name Bubulcus is Latin for herdsman, referring, like the English name, to this species' association with cattle. Ibis is a Latin and Greek word which originally referred to another white wading bird, the sacred ibis, but was applied to this species in error.|$|E
50|$|Some {{populations of}} <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets</b> are migratory, others are dispersive, and {{distinguishing}} {{between the two}} can be difficult for this species. In many areas populations can be both sedentary and migratory. In the northern hemisphere, migration is from cooler climes to warmer areas, but <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets</b> nesting in Australia migrate to cooler Tasmania and New Zealand {{in the winter and}} return in the spring. Populations in southern India appear to show local migrations in response to the monsoons. They move north from Kerala after September. During winter, many birds have been seen flying at night with flocks of Indian pond herons (Ardeola grayii) on the south-eastern coast of India, and a winter influx has also been noted in Sri Lanka.|$|R
50|$|A {{large number}} of <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets,</b> pond herons and other waterbirds {{can be seen in}} the rivers of Cooum and Adyar. In addition, the Government of India has plans to {{classify}} the Adyar Estuary into a protected eco-system. About 75,000 birds migrate to Chennai every year.|$|R
50|$|Another {{example is}} the black drongos and the <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets</b> found in India. These birds feed on insects {{on the back of}} cattle, which helps to keep them disease-free. Destroying the nesting {{habitats}} of these birds would cause a decrease in the cattle population because of the spread of insect-borne diseases.|$|R
5|$|The family Ardeidae {{contains}} the herons, egrets and bitterns. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns {{tend to be}} shorter-necked and more secretive. Members of Ardeidae fly with their necks retracted, unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises and spoonbills. Nine species have been recorded in Tasmania, one of which (the <b>cattle</b> <b>egret)</b> is a recent self-introduction and three others are vagrants.|$|E
5|$|A <b>cattle</b> <b>egret</b> will weakly {{defend the}} area around a grazing animal against others of the same species, but if the area is swamped by egrets it will give up and {{continue}} foraging elsewhere. Where numerous large animals are present, cattle egrets selectively forage around species that move at around 5–15steps per minute, avoiding faster and slower moving herds; in Africa, cattle egrets selectively forage behind plains zebras, waterbuck, blue wildebeest and Cape buffalo. Dominant birds feed nearest to the host, and obtain more food.|$|E
5|$|It {{is a white}} bird {{adorned with}} buff plumes in the {{breeding}} season. It nests in colonies, usually near bodies of water and often with other wading birds. The nest is a platform of sticks in trees or shrubs. Cattle egrets exploit drier and open habitats more than other heron species. Their feeding habitats include seasonally inundated grasslands, pastures, farmlands, wetlands and rice paddies. They often accompany cattle or other large mammals, catching insect and small vertebrate prey disturbed by these animals. Some populations of the <b>cattle</b> <b>egret</b> are migratory and others show post-breeding dispersal.|$|E
50|$|Land {{surrounding}} the small community is mostly irrigated, la Thompson seedless grapevines used for Raisin and agricultural land. Row crops include feed {{crops such as}} alfalfa. It is common to see <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets</b> patrolling the fields for insect life. Raptors including red-shouldered hawks are also widely visible during daylight hours.|$|R
5000|$|An {{arbovirus}} [...] "Balagodu", trematodes {{and several}} other parasites have been isolated from the species. Antibodies to Japanese encephalitis and West Nile virus has been detected in pond herons and <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets</b> from southern India. Traces of heavy metals acquired from feeding in polluted waters may be particularly concentrated in the tail feathers.|$|R
50|$|Ochsner Island on {{the east}} side of the park {{features}} a rookery that is one of the prime birding spots in Greater New Orleans. The island attracts hundreds of wading birds, including great <b>egrets,</b> <b>cattle</b> <b>egrets,</b> snowy egrets, ibis, little blue herons, green herons, night herons and others. The park is also home to diving double-crested cormorants and anhingas, as well as to many species of ducks. Recently, black-bellied whistling ducks have begun using the park's lagoons as a stopover on their migrations.|$|R
