50|$|The <b>Cuvier's</b> <b>gazelle</b> (Gazella cuvieri) is {{a species}} of gazelle found in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. It {{is also known as}} the edmi.

40|$|Here I {{present a}} {{detailed}} analysis of individual inbreeding coefficient effects on some reproductive parameters and longevity in three species of gazelles under different conservation status: vulnerable dorcas <b>gazelle,</b> endangered <b>Cuvier’s</b> <b>gazelle,</b> and extinct in the wild mhorr gazelle. The novelty of this study stems from the inclusion of both males and females in analyses including a large database of information collected during two decades of periodical studbook inventories for these species. Translocations to different zoo locations of the extinct subspecies mhorr gazelle do not apparently affect reproductive performance (population sex ratio) or individual longevity. In agreement with previous works, the average inbreeding coefficients vary inter-specifically, being higher in Cuvier’s, followed by mhorr and dorcas gazelles. This reflects the different population size of the founding individuals of each species’ captive population. Sexual maturity and age at first birth follow an allometric pattern, occurring at an earlier age in the smallest species (dorcas), followed by Cuvier’s and then the mhorr <b>gazelle.</b> Twinning in <b>Cuvier’s</b> <b>gazelle</b> depends on maternal experience, as it is less frequent in primiparous females. Inbreeding affects neither twinning nor sex ratio. Mhorr gazelles’ studbook shows several causes of death and it emerges that a higher proportion of non-inbred females die due to pathologies than males, although both sexes show similar proportion of mortal pathologies when inbred. Multifactor ANOVA shows that longevity decreases with inbreeding level and that females live longer than males in the three species of gazelles studied, as expected in polygynous mammals. Mhorr and dorcas non-inbred females show higher juvenile survival than males, whereas inbred individuals show a similar declining juvenile survival, particularly in mhorr and <b>Cuvier’s</b> <b>gazelles.</b> Finally, it is discussed the apparent 3 inbreeding tolerance in Cuvier’s species, and the great value keeping and studying long term data of well-monitored captive populations may prove to the conservation of threatened species.

40|$|Captive {{breeding}} of a threatened species {{is an important}} tool for species conservation. Since 1971 the Parque de Rescate de Fauna Sahariana, a facility belonging to the Estación Experimental de Zonas Áridas (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas) in Almería, manages populations of three species of endangered gazelles which were rescue from extinction through ex situ conservation, captive breeding programmes. One of this species managed at Almería is <b>Cuvier’s</b> <b>gazelle,</b> or “harmush” {{as it is called}} in Western Sahara. The first <b>Cuvier’s</b> <b>gazelle</b> individuals (2. 2) were brought to the Parque de Rescate de Fauna Sahariana in 1975 by Dr. Valverde from the former Spanish Sahara, where {{they were part of a}} captive population in the Oued Drâa Valley, near Tan-Tan (Escós 1992). Thirty-three years later, the captive population of the harmush in Almería is over 145 individuals. Apart from that, there are smaller captive populations in 11 zoological institutions of the United Stated, Canada, and Europe, totalling up to 260 individuals (including Almería). Considering that one of the goals of captive breeding is to establish captive populations large enough to be demographically stable, it seems that this goal has been met by the captive population of <b>Cuvier’s</b> <b>gazelle.</b> During this period, the species studbook has been published twice. The first, by Dr. J. Escós in 1992, included data from 1975 up to 1992. In 2005, the second edition, by Drs. T. Abáigar and M. Cano, updated records to 2001. Wendy Enright, the North American studbook keeper, has been updating and publishing a deliverable version of the Regional Studbook yearly. In 2001, she provided us with an updated version of the North American population, which was included in the published edition by Abáigar and Cano (2005). Since then, Wendy has been collaborating in this International Studbook by maintaining the North American Regional one. This current edition is not just an update. It includes the records of individuals that have been “missing” for over 20 years. We are deeply in doubt to Beatrix Köler, from the Münchener Tierpark Hellabrun, for providing the invaluable information on the individuals they kept that zoo for about seven years. From this information we have been able to “find” out very important data on the parentage of individuals which were not included in previous editions. Considering that individuals from Münchener Tierpark Hellabrun were transferred to the San Diego Zoo (USA) between 1982 and 1988, data provided by Mrs Köler has much improved the information available on the world-wide captive population of <b>Cuvier’s</b> <b>gazelle.</b> IUCN recommendations require captive populations to be founded and managed according to sound scientific principles for the primary purpose of securing the survival of the species through stable, self-sustaining captive populations. With this goal in mind, we became the studbook keepers for this species in 2001. In the following pages, we would like to show what has been done to reach the goals of the captive breeding program throughout the history of the captive population: 1) to maintain a healthy age structure, 2) to ensure that reproduction is reliably successful, 3) to protect the population against diseases, and 4) to preserve the gene pool to avoid the problems of inbreeding. An updated version of the studbook up to 31 December 2007 is included, where some parentage errors found in the previous versions have been detected and corrected. Successful breeding in captivity is dependent on the availability of information on the focal species. Therefore, we also provide a husbandry manual, as it represents a valuable tool for institutions participating or willing to participate in the <b>Cuvier’s</b> <b>gazelle</b> breeding programme. We hope the guidelines of this manual improve species management through better understanding of the species in captivity.

40|$|The use of {{assisted}} reproductive {{techniques for}} endangered species {{is a major}} goal for conservation. One of these techniques, testis tissue xenografting, allows {{for the development of}} spermatozoa from animals that die before reaching sexual maturity. To assess the potential use of this technique with endangered species, testis tissue from six Iberian lynxes (one fetus, two perinatal cubs, two 6 -month-old and one 2 -year-old lynx), two <b>Cuvier's</b> <b>gazelle</b> fetuses and one 8 -month-old Mohor gazelle were transplanted ectopically into nude mice. Tissue from the lynx fetus, perinatal cubs and 2 -year-old donors degenerated, whereas spermatogonia were present in 15 % of seminiferous tubules more than 70 weeks after grafting in transplanted testis tissue from 6 -month-old donors. Seminal vesicle weights (indicative of testosterone production) increased over time in mice transplanted with tissue from 6 -month-old lynxes. Progression of spermatogenesis was observed in xenografts from gazelles and was donor age dependent. Tissue from <b>Cuvier's</b> <b>gazelle</b> fetuses contained spermatocytes 40 weeks after grafting. Finally, round spermatids were found 28 weeks after transplantation in grafts from the 8 -month-old Mohor gazelle. This {{is the first time that}} xenotransplantation of testicular tissue has been performed with an endangered felid and the first successful xenotransplantation in an endangered species.

40|$|Since {{threatened}} species are generally incapable of surviving {{in their natural}} environments, ex situ conservation programs are required to preserve them from total extinction. Captive breeding provides the tool to rear sustained populations. Knowledge about biology of such species is critical for managing such breeding programmes. In this paper {{we look at the}} sex variation in calves surviving to 30 days in captive populations of two endangered polygynous gazelles, Gazella cuvieri and Gazella dama mhorr. We examined which of the following mother traits may affect sex allocation: her age, experience and inbreeding coefficient. Because twins are quite common in <b>Cuvier's</b> <b>gazelle,</b> we also analyze whether offspring sex is mediated by litter size in this gazelle. In both species the overall sex ratio did not differ from unity at the age of 30 days. These results support the suggestion that for a given population to be in equilibrium, a 1 : 1 calf sex ratio is to be expected, with females in good condition producing sons and females in poor condition producing daughters. We also found that offspring sex is not significantly related to the same mother traits in the two <b>gazelles</b> studied. <b>Cuvier's</b> <b>gazelle</b> findings showed that only maternal inbreeding influenced offspring sex, the less inbred the mother the higher the probability of producing sons. In contrast, none of the maternal traits studied were related to offspring sex in Mohor gazelle. Two non exclusive explanations are given to justify differences observed between these two species; one relate to a probable differential cost of producing either sex; the other refers to the actual homozygosis level in captive populations of each species. For <b>Cuvier's</b> <b>gazelle</b> litter size has no effect on offspring sex when the sex of the littermate is taken into account. This result fit predictions derived from Trivers-Willard model: mother in good conditions (less inbred) produce the sex with higher fitness returns (i. e., male), no matter if born at single or twins brood. Many variables are likely to affect progeny sex ratio. We have presently examined only a few.

50|$|His work, however, {{reached its}} peak in 1971 onwards, when, in {{collaboration}} with Valverde, he created the La Hoya Nature Reserve, on a farm owned by the CSIC, located {{in the neighborhood of}} that name, towards the back of the citadel of the Almeria capital. Valverde and Cano, particularly sensitive about the little-studied situation of the North African gazelle species, such as the dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas neglecta) and the dama gazelle or springbok Mohor (Gazella dama), decided to undertake captive breeding, a successful pioneering act at the time. It was the Spanish Army who assisted in the capture of the species required in the Sahara Desert. In 1975 the Natural Reserve became the Saharan Wildlife Rescue Park, under the umbrella of the Ministry of Education and Science and the Arid Zone Experimental Station of Almeria. The Park performs an important task of breeding and reintroduction of species of North African gazelles, including the above plus other species such as <b>Cuvier's</b> <b>gazelle</b> (Gazella cuvieri) and aoudad Sahara (Ammotragus lervia sahariensis).|$|R
40|$|There is a {{constant}} {{increase in the number}} of species suffering marked reductions in population size. This reduction in size and the lack of genetic flow may lead to a decrease in genetic variability and to matings between close relatives (i. e. inbreeding) with an ensuing reduction in fitness. It is thus important to understand the mechanism underlying the deleterious effects of inbreeding and to develop reproductive biotechnologies that will allow the reduction of inbreeding depression by facilitating gene exchange between populations. The study of three endangered species of <b>gazelles,</b> <b>Cuvier's</b> <b>gazelle</b> (Gazella cuvieri), Mohor gazelle (Gazella dama mhorr) and dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas neglecta) has revealed that inbreeding negatively affects several semen parameters (motility, sperm morphology, acrosome integrity). Semen cryopreservation has been achieved in the three species but success varies depending on the diluent employed and the level of inbreeding. Artificial insemination of Mohor gazelles have led to the birth of the first gazelle born using frozen-thawed semen but improvements are needed before this technology can be applied on a routine basis for the genetic management of the populations. Collection of oocytes after ovarian stimulation, followed by in vitro maturation, fertilization and culture has met with some initial success in the Mohor gazelle. These, together with other reproductive technologies, will offer an invaluable help in preserving the maximum of genetic diversity of these and related endangered ungulate species...|$|R
40|$|The arid {{climate of}} the High Algerian Plateaux {{constitutes}} a limiting factor {{to the development of}} wild endangered <b>Cuvier’s</b> <b>Gazelle</b> (Gazella cuvieri) registered in IUCN’s red list. This antelope can utilize water from plants as well as dew, but it needs to visit waterholes frequently. In this semi-desert region, the classified nature reserve of Mergueb located in the M’sila Wilaya (Algeria) is the predilection area for <b>Cuvier’s</b> <b>Gazelle.</b> It is located south of Algiers in the main high steppes of Hodna and covers an area of about 16 482 hectares. It faces however the critical problem of water scarcity and surface water storage, vital for the survival of the gazelle. Precipitation in this arid region, with an annual average around 260 mm, is characterized by a large variability, with a sporadic and torrential distribution. Maximum monthly values are observed in May and from October to December. Months from June to September suffer important water deficit. The study undertaken in 2002 by the General Direction of Forestry (DGF) within the framework of G 35 UNDP-DGF project led to the selection of sites to mobilize and store surface water for wild mammals to ensure water availability during periods of shortage. An integrated management scheme has been proposed, using simple techniques and local building materials at a minimum cost. It is represented by the ‘Djobs traditional water storage system’ which description constitutes the core of the present paper. The choice of djobs as water storage system is based on: (1) simple building techniques adapted to the local materials; (2) a topography with very small watershed, where the runoff can be gathered and stored. Djob can be defined as a large shallow hole in the soil, or a small pond, that will store enough runoff water and will allow gazelles to easily use it without being scared. Favorable runoff catchment area for djob’s construction, should: (1) be clean, smooth, non-erosive and have small slope to slow down the runoff; (2) not require heavy equipment disturbing the environment; (3) provide local building materials and at a minimum cost; (4) be easy to clean and to restore; (5) allow the wild species to approach. Selected sites are characterized by: (1) their position across small shallow and very narrow thalwegs, thus requiring only an embankment to be built with local rocks and soil gathered from the stream channel bottom; (2) impermeable reservoir bottom and side wall reducing water loss; (3) limited dike height which is function of the amount of water to be mobilized and which should reduce surface water plan to limit evaporation. With this storing method, drinking water is available for a long period and the construction is easy to realize and does not disturb the environment, thus allowing wild livestock to settle. Because of the extreme intensity of the storms that may occur in the region, the dike resistance should be increased: (1) by curing the stream channel bottom and cleaning the banks (thalweg preparation); (2) by compacting the talus and its vegetation. Autumn rainfall is responsible for alluvial deposits in the djobs. Silt deposits inside these reservoirs are inevitable in these arid lands. However, the choice of the sites should minimize this effect; catchment area less than 63 000 m 2 with geological formations hard to erode should be favoured. In conclusion, djobs are the solution for helping developing and protecting <b>Cuvier’s</b> <b>Gazelle.</b> Their construction is simple to perform at a minimum cost. However, they should periodically be cleaned, controlled and fixedL'aridité du climat des Hauts Plateaux algériens constitue un facteur limitant pour l'émancipation de la faune sauvage et particulièrement pour les espèces protégées.

40|$|Together {{with the}} {{avoidance}} of any negative impact of inbreeding, preservation of genetic variability for life-history traits that could undergo future selective pressure is {{a major issue in}} endangered species management programmes. However, most of these programmes ignore that, apart from the direct action of genes on such traits, parents, as contributors of offspring environment, can influence offspring performance through indirect parental effects (when parental genotype and phenotype exerts environmental influences on offspring phenotype independently of additive genetic effects). Using quantitative genetic models, we estimated the additive genetic variance for juvenile survival in a population of the endangered <b>Cuvier’s</b> <b>gazelle</b> kept in captivity since 1975. The dataset analyzed included performance recording for 700 calves and a total pedigree of 740 individuals. Results indicated that in this population juvenile survival harbors significant additive genetic variance. The estimates of heritability obtained were in general moderate (0. 115 – 0. 457) and not affected by the inclusion of inbreeding in the models. Maternal genetic contribution to juvenile survival seems to be of major importance in this gazelle’s population as well. Indirect genetic and indirect environmental effects assigned to mothers (i. e., maternal genetic and maternal permanent environmental effects) roughly explain a quarter of the total variance estimated for the trait analyzed. These findings have major evolutionary consequences for the species as show that offspring phenotypes can evolve strictly through changes in the environment provided by mothers. They are also relevant for the captive breeding programme of the species. To take into account, the contribution that mothers have on offspring phenotype through indirect genetic effects when designing pairing strategies might serve to identify those females with better ability to recruit, and, additionally, to predict reliable responses to selection in the captive population.

40|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{of endangered species}} often aims at preserving genetic diversity and to avoid {{the harmful effects of}} inbreeding. However, deleterious alleles causing inbreeding depression can be purged when inbreeding persists over several generations. Despite its great importance both for evolutionary biology and for captive breeding programmes, few studies have addressed whether and to which extent purging may occur. Here we undertake a longitudinal study with the largest captive population of <b>Cuvier's</b> <b>gazelle</b> managed under a European Endangered Species Programme since 1975. Previous results in this population have shown that highly inbred mothers tend to produce more daughters, and this fact was used in 2006 to reach a more appropriate sex-ratio in this polygynous species by changing the pairing strategy (i. e., pairing some inbred females instead of keeping them as surplus individuals in the population). Here, by using studbook data we explore whether purging has occurred in the population by investigating whether after the change in pairing strategy a) inbreeding and homozygosity increased at the population level, b) fitness (survival) increased, and c) the relationship between inbreeding and juvenile survival, was positive. Consistent with the existence of purging, we found an increase in inbreeding coefficients, homozygosity and juvenile survival. In addition, we showed that {{in the course of the}} breeding programme the relationship between inbreeding and juvenile survival was not uniform but rather changed over time: it was negative in the early years, flat in the middle years and positive after the change in pairing strategy. We highlight that by allowing inbred individuals to mate in captive stocks we may favour sex-ratio bias towards females, a desirable managing strategy to reduce the surplus of males that force most zoos to use ethical culling and euthanizing management tools. We discuss these possibilities but also acknowledge that many other effects should be considered before implementing inbreeding and purging as elements in management decisions...|$|R
