5|$|In December 2007 Pacific National {{announced}} plans to sell or close its grain transport and Portlink rural container business operations in Victoria. The decision has been criticised as it will force grain growers to use higher cost road transport to transport the annual grain harvest from rural silos to the ports. The decision has seen many commentators accuse Pacific National of only acquiring the operations of Freight Australia in 2004 {{for the purposes of}} asset stripping and eliminating competition in rail freight. In 2008 El Zorro took over the Warrnambool - Melbourne <b>container</b> <b>service</b> from Pacific National, and moved into broad gauge grain services, while Aurizon has taken over the Melbourne - Horsham <b>container</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Common {{middleware}} platforms {{support software}} components {{by providing a}} number of standard <b>container</b> <b>services.</b> Adding new <b>container</b> <b>services</b> can adapt a system to changed requirements without modifying its constituent components. Custom-made <b>container</b> <b>services</b> can intercept communication calls between system’s components and enforce new or changed requirements. Hence, legacy or off-the-shelf components {{can be adapted to}} comply with requirements that are not taken into consideration by the initial system design. In a global market, companies must be able to quickly adapt their software systems to requirement changes. However, not all middleware platforms allow to integrate additional <b>container</b> <b>services,</b> yet. This paper describes a framework that enables developers to dynamically integrate additional <b>container</b> <b>services</b> into existing systems and to configure them at runtime. Moreover, the framework allows for conditional execution of these services – they can adapt to the system’s state or its current context. ...|$|R

25|$|In 1973, {{the area}} around the old railway station was {{developed}} into a container port facility, with P & O operating a <b>container</b> <b>service</b> to Larne in Northern Ireland. In 1975, this became a Roll-on/roll-off service. This development led indirectly to some renewal of the then largely derelict Dock Street area, and improved road access to the town to support the container traffic. Twice-daily <b>container</b> <b>service</b> continued until 2004 when Stena Line bought the route and increased the service to three times a day. In December 2010, Stena Line announced that the service would be withdrawn at the end of 2010, with the loss of 140 jobs.|$|E

25|$|On May 12, 1975 {{a unit of}} the Cambodian Khmer Rouge {{seized a}} {{container}} ship, the SS Mayagüez, on the Gulf of Siam. The botched recovery of the ship's crew on May 15 by the U.S. Marine Corps off the island of Koh Tang became known as the Mayagüez Incident, considered by historians as one of president Gerald Ford's first foreign policy setbacks. The ship was owned and operated by Sea-Land Service, which operated <b>container</b> <b>service</b> to Puerto Rico until 1975 and explains why the city's name became entangled in such a major military international incident.|$|E
500|$|ML inaugurated a <b>container</b> <b>service</b> to the Mediterranean in 1971 using smaller ships. [...] Initial {{destinations}} included Malta, Cyprus and Israel.

To further improve service to shippers, two large road hauliers were acquired in 1971 and 1972, enabling a [...] "door-to-door" [...] container operation to be introduced. Facilities for container storage and repair were also acquired. Following its successful pioneering of the UK container trade, ML {{was given the}} Queen's Award for Export in 1971, {{the first to be}} given to a shipping company; every ship in the fleet flew the award flag.|$|E
40|$|As {{the world}} economy slipped into {{recession}} in recent years, growth in international trade slowed down considerably. Slow growth in international trade often leads {{to a decline in}} inter-modal traffic and the subsequent reduction in demand for <b>container</b> <b>services.</b> The reduced demand in <b>container</b> <b>services</b> and the continuous glut of container port facilities throughout the world have sparked fierce competition among international container terminals. In an effort to help port authorities develop a winning formula in the increasingly competitive container market, this paper aims to develop a meaningful set of benchmarks that will set the standard for best practices. In particular, we propose an inter-temporal data envelopment analysis (DEA) that is proved to be useful for measuring the operational efficiency of various profit or non-profit organisations over time. Using the examples of major container terminals in South Korea, this paper illustrates the usefulness of DEA for the continuous improvement of <b>container</b> <b>services.</b> <b>container</b> terminals; data environmental analysis; DEA; inter-temporal efficiency; benchmarking; best practice; South Korea; container services; continuous improvement...|$|R

500|$|With {{the running}} {{down of the}} coal mining and {{shipbuilding}} industries, Blyth largely exists today as a dormitory town in the commuter belt serving Newcastle and North Tyneside. [...] However, its port still remains a major industry in the area, handling over 1.5 million tonnes of cargo annually. [...] Its main trades are forest products, such as paper, pulp and timber, unitised cargo (containers and RoRo) and the import of materials used {{in the production of}} aluminium. [...] It also handles the import of a variety of stones and metals. [...] A twice weekly <b>container</b> <b>service</b> between the port and Moerdijk, near Rotterdam, provides connections with the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and France as well as South America and the Far East. [...] The port is operated by Port of Blyth, which is the operating division of Blyth Harbour Commission. [...] Port of Blyth is a trust port, which means that it is governed by its own local legislation under the control of an independent board; there are no shareholders and therefore no dividends to support, which allows any surplus to be reinvested in the port.|$|E

2500|$|In 1926, {{a regular}} {{connection}} of the luxury passenger train from London to Paris, Golden Arrow/Fleche d'Or, [...] by Southern Railway and French Northern Railway, began. For transport of passengers' baggage four containers were used. These containers were loaded in London or Paris and carried to ports, Dover or Calais, on flat {{cars in the}} UK and [...] "CIWL Pullman Golden Arrow Fourgon of CIWL" [...] in France. At the Second World Motor Transport Congress in Rome, September 1928, Italian senator Silvio Crespi proposed the use of containers for road and railway transport systems, using collaboration rather than competition. [...] This would be done {{under the auspices of}} an international organ similar to the Sleeping Car Company, which provided international carriage of passengers in sleeping wagons. In 1928 Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) started regular <b>container</b> <b>service</b> in the northeast United States. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929 in New York and the subsequent Great Depression, many countries were without any means of transport for cargo. The railroads were sought as a possibility to transport cargo, and there was an opportunity to bring containers into broader use. Under auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris in Venice on September 30, 1931, on one of the platforms of the Maritime Station (Mole di Ponente), practical tests were done to assess the best construction for European containers as part of an international competition.|$|E
