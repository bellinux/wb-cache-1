5|$|In 2014 Consumer Reports {{published}} {{results from}} a survey conducted with 19 secret shoppers that went to 85 dealerships in four states, making anonymous visits between December 2013 and March 2014. The secret shoppers asked a number of specific questions about cars to test the salespeople’s knowledge about electric cars. The <b>consumer</b> <b>magazine</b> decided to conduct the survey after several consumers who {{wanted to buy a}} plug-in car reported to the organization that some dealerships were steering them toward gasoline-powered models. The survey found that not all sales people seemed enthusiastic about making PEV sales; a few outright discouraged it, and even one dealer was reluctant to even show a plug-in model despite having one in stock. And many sales people seemed not to have a good understanding of electric-car tax breaks and other incentives or of charging needs and costs. Consumer Reports also found that when it came to answering basic questions, sales people at Chevrolet, Ford, and Nissan dealerships tended to be better informed than those at Honda and Toyota. The survey found that most of the Toyota dealerships visited recommended against buying a Prius Plug-in and suggested buying a standard Prius hybrid instead. Overall, the secret shoppers reported that only 13 dealers “discouraged sale of EV,” with seven of them being in New York. However, at 35 of the 85 dealerships visited, the secret shoppers said sales people recommended buying a gasoline-powered car instead.|$|E

2500|$|According to Consumer Reports, , the Nissan Leaf has an out-of-pocket {{operating}} cost of 3.5 cents per mile (2.19¢ per km) while the heavier Chevrolet Volt has a cost in electric mode of 3.8 cents per mile (2.38¢ per km). These costs {{are based on}} the U.S. national average electricity rate of 11 cents per [...] and energy consumption was estimated from their own tests. The <b>consumer</b> <b>magazine</b> also compared the Leaf with the most fuel-efficient hybrid and gasoline-powered cars as tested by Consumer Reports. The results are summarized in the following table, and the analysis found that the Leaf {{operating cost}} is much {{less than half of the}} gasoline-powered cars for trips up to , which is close to the Leaf's maximum range. The Volt while on EV mode has a close cost per mile but as the distance is larger than its electric range of , the Leaf advantage is similar to the other cars. Consumer Reports also noted that even with a much higher electric rate of 19 cents per , such as rural Connecticut, the Leaf still cost about 20% less to operate than the Prius and around 50% less than the Corolla.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} thesis “The role of the <b>consumer</b> <b>magazines</b> in {{the leisure}} time utilization of the young people” is to give an overview of media use and role of <b>consumer</b> <b>magazines</b> reading habits of youngsters. The main part consists of five chapters. First chapter gives an overview of empirical and theoretical background that {{is related to the}} concept of lifestyle, different previous researches of leisure time habits, and the usage of <b>consumer</b> <b>magazines</b> among young people. Second chapter of the thesis provides the reader with some {{of the results of the}} questionnaire “Me. World. Media” conducted by the Department of Journalism and Communication of University of Tartu in 2005. This questionnaire analyzed the results of people` s leisure time habits and media use and that information is also used as the basis for this thesis. Next chapter gives the explanation of the choice of qualitative study methodology and the description of selection criteria of the interviewee´ s. In discussion and results part compendious picture has been developed according to the thesis and conclusion. While observing the use of media and <b>consumer</b> <b>magazines</b> reading among the youth, it turned out that media use is mostly differentiated by the age, gender and free time activities of young people. Young people are active TV watchers and new media, especially Internet plays a significant role in youth leisure time activities. Qualitative analysis showed that representatives use media mostly on entertaining and communicative purposes. Reading <b>consumer</b> <b>magazines</b> has mainly a diverting function in youth leisure time. Because of that, young people are affected by <b>consumer</b> <b>magazines</b> only by taking over new styles, trends and reading this kind of magazines is an easy and cosy way to spend time. But the magazines are not causing young people to behave differently or making them to take over new attitudes...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper was}} refereed. In 1998, the retail sales and {{marketing}} division of Time Inc., the largest publisher of <b>consumer</b> <b>magazines</b> in the US, reviewed its newsstand distribution principles and procedures for its magazines. This review affected the three major distribution decisions: the evaluation of each magazine’s national print order, the wholesaler allotment procedure, and the store distribution process. For this three-echelon distribution problem, we had to adapt wellknown formal solutions {{so that they could}} be implemented within the constraints of the magazine distribution channel. The revised process, referred to as Time Inc. ’s Draw Management Program, has generated incremental profits in excess of $ 3. 5 million annually. (Inventory/production: applications. Industries: communications/journalism.) In the US, the distribution channel for <b>consumer</b> <b>magazines</b> sold at retail consists of publishers, wholesalers, and retailers. Currently, several thousand <b>consumer</b> <b>magazines</b> are distributed to about 200, 000 stores. These numbers, however, belie the market concentration in this industry. In many retail outlets, the leading 100 <b>consumer</b> <b>magazines,</b> by and large published by a handful of major publishing houses, account for over 80 percent of all unit sales volume. Most of the 200 magazine wholesalers servicing retailers are organized into four groups. The leading 200 retail chains account for over 80 percent of all magazine sales. Distribution levels in the channel are negotiated by all partners. As publishers take unsold product back for a full refund of cost, they are mostly responsible for determining the national print order as wel...|$|R
