Cox stated, [...] "Miller's going to try to run things in a more conservative way, but he's still trying to run things -- so he has the same fundamental problem of all the other politicians". After Cox was arrested, Miller sought to distance himself from Cox, releasing a statement saying [...] "Mr. Miller has never had any connection to any of Mr. Cox's militia organizations, and in no way condones any lawless behavior." ...|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} with John Norris of MTV News, <b>Cox</b> <b>said</b> of the reception to Let the Blind Lead: [...] "The response to this Atlas Sound record…the general response was very, very positive, but very, very much rooted in the concept {{that this is an}} emotional album. [...] This is an album {{that has a lot of}} feeling behind it, and it's very naked…That might in fact be , but the reason it is that way is because it was done stream-of-consciously. [...] I'm not calculated. [...] I don't mind sentimentality, as long as it's not calculated." ...|$|E
500|$|Cox {{benefited from}} co-creating Confessions, {{as well as}} from the success of [...] "Burn".

His contribution to this song elevated him to fame, and garnered more attention for his past work. [...] "Burn" [...] earned him two Grammy nominations. <b>Cox</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Everybody who does this for a living, dreams about being nominated. It's the ultimate accomplishment. I've always been the silent guy — I come in, do my job and head out. I like to leave all the glory and shine to others, but this is the validation that means the most to me.

Through the platform, banks can provide an added service to their clients by connecting those seeking capital through alternate routes to lenders and institutional investors." [...] The Marketplace Lending Gateway also permits brands to offer loan alternatives to their constituencies.

500|$|Kojima's input {{included}} advising Cox's team {{to redesign}} {{some of the}} lead character, Gabriel, who he felt needed a [...] "more heroic face". Originally, Gabriel's design resembled a classic barbarian, before Kojima then advised the staff to refine him into a character that was more relatable for the player. Cox mentioned that the voice acting provided by Robert Carlyle helped humanize Gabriel's character. Kojima also oversaw the Japanese localization of the game, employing a number of voice actors from the Japanese versions of Metal Gear Solid. Cox stated that Kojima otherwise allowed the actors a lot of freedom with the project. MercurySteam wanted to depart from the art style of the other games in favour of one that was darker. <b>Cox</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The old games had this boyish depiction of vampires and monsters and we wanted {{them to have a}} darker edge this time around."

500|$|To create {{tracks on}} Let the Blind Lead, Cox {{continually}} adds elements to a song until he [...] "feel like it's getting crowded…When it sounds done, it's done. And {{if it seems}} like it's missing something, I'll go back and add something." [...] Most of his music {{is the product of}} several hours' work, rather than that of a few days. [...] To Pitchfork Media <b>Cox</b> <b>said</b> that, with each song, [...] "The genesis is usually a beat." [...] Cox considers the music of Let the Blind Lead to have a [...] "dynamic arc": {{the first half of the}} record contains [...] "more accessible songs. I was very depressed in the middle, and it created this kind of black hole of misery. Then I tried to bring it up again at the end." [...] Cox intended for his music to be [...] "therapeutic", for both himself and his audience. [...] In addition, he wanted the album to have a healing element, and be something [...] "somebody could listen to all the way through and feel like they went through a bad period of time and came out of it." [...] Pauline Oliveros, a composer who runs an organization that studies music therapy, was described by Cox as having [...] "a big influence" [...] on him and his ideas of therapeutic music. [...] He considers music [...] "the only art form I know of that has such an immediate effect on the human psyche", and found the time he first met and talked with Oliveros as being [...] "like meeting a hero of mine." ...|$|E
500|$|While in prison, Cox mailed several {{letters to}} the St. Petersburg Times in 2008 in which he accused {{politician}} Kevin White of taking bribes from him during Cox's criminal career. He claims he made payoffs to White, an ultimately successful candidate for the Tampa City Council, in 2002 and 2003. <b>Cox</b> <b>said</b> White {{told him he could}} not receive the money directly, and suggested that Cox have friends donate $500 each, and then reimburse them. Records and statements from those who donated show that Cox did in fact make numerous contributions to White's campaign, and reimbursed others who did so as well. White, he claims, agreed to vote to rezone vacant properties in Tampa and Ybor City. When Cox was first arrested, the FBI talked to him about White, whom they were also investigating, and he told them the same information. He claimed to have paid him $7,000 in cash in addition to the recorded contributions he arranged. When White and a fellow City Council member were told Cox's contributions might have been illegal in 2004, his colleague told the police, while White kept silent. White has denied that he knew these contributions were reimbursed, and called Cox's accusations [...] "the jailhouse ramblings of a reputed con man." [...] White said he befriended Cox when he came to believe the con man was interested in revitalizing Tampa Heights. Cox had fled the Tampa area before White cast any rezoning votes, so there is no voting record which could help confirm the validity of his accusations. In 2012, White, who had gone on to serve as Hillsborough County Commissioner, was convicted of unrelated federal bribery and corruption charges and sentenced to three years in federal prison.|$|E

Martha guarded her independence and reminisced with her visiting nurse Anna (Gosia Dobrowolska) while dying of cancer. The film also starred Norman Kaye as her neighbour Billy who had dementia, and Chris Haywood as her son Jonathan. Florance's performance was widely praised both within Australia, and internationally following the film's release.

2500|$|In March 2008, SEC Chairman Christopher Cox gave {{a speech}} {{entitled}} the [...] "'Naked' Short Selling Anti-Fraud Rule," [...] in which he announced new SEC efforts to combat naked short selling. Under the proposal, the SEC would create an antifraud rule targeting those who knowingly deceive brokers about having located securities before engaging in short sales, and who fail to deliver the securities by the delivery date. [...] <b>Cox</b> <b>said</b> the proposal would address concerns about short-selling abuses, particularly {{in the market for}} small-cap stocks. [...] Even with the regulation in place, the SEC received hundreds of complaints in 2007 about alleged abuses involving short sales.

2500|$|While expressing {{concerns}} about Robertson's alleged past expressions of antisemitism (faculty blamed this on poorly chosen ghost writers) and associations with dominion theology promoting Christian control of secular institutions that some critics believe inspired the school's name, <b>Cox</b> <b>said</b> the faculty insisted that Regent {{did not support}} Dominionism, pointing to the firing of Herbert Titus, the founding dean of the Law School, who was inclined to such a philosophy. Cox pointed to historian Bruce Barron's suggestion that the Regent faculty serve as a [...] "moderating influence": [...] "They are pragmatists who accept religious pluralism and do not insist on the universal applicability of Old Testament law" [...] while preferring to focus on constitutional issues. Cox characterized Regent's mission as continuing {{in the tradition of}} religiously trained professionals by various Catholic and Protestant faiths such as Jesuit universities and (originally) Harvard. He found that academic freedom was promoted and that although half of the student body considered themselves affiliated with renewal theology, there existed a wider range of political attitudes than he first imagined.|$|E

His verdict was to wait. Matthew Cox (Rock, Paper, Shotgun) said it was good that the developers switched to the Unity engine in late 2014 due to the instability of the game. He found many glitches in the late 2014 version, including unresponsive animals, framerate issues and sometimes servers would randomly disconnect him. <b>Cox</b> <b>said</b> Rust had potential, and the performance issues had been regularly acknowledged in the dev blogs.
