5|$|On {{top of the}} Przeworsk culture's {{internal}} <b>crisis</b> <b>situation</b> came external pressures, {{namely the}} massive migration of peoples. At around 370 AD the Huns crossed the Volga River, defeating the Alans and then the Ostrogoths, causing in 375 the fall of their state located in the Black Sea shores region. This unleashed a domino effect, as various Germanic peoples moved west and south to avoid the danger. The Visigoths and others retreated, forcing further migrations, while {{the weakness of the}} Roman Empire encouraged encroachments of its territory, the whole scenario resulting in the fall of its western part. The paths of this Great Migration of Peoples led in part through the Polish lands, and the Germanic tribes living here joined the movement themselves, with the result of an almost complete, {{in the course of the}} 5th century, depopulation of Poland.|$|E

Originally an opening batsmen, Arnold has since moved down the batting order. He is most famous in the pearl island as a utility and very versatile player, making him ideally suitable for the limited over version of the game. However, when he started his career, he was seen primarily as a solid top order batsmen where he impressed against Australia during the AIWA cup of 1999, {{as well as the}} subsequent Test series against them, where he batted at No. 3. Failure in the 2003 Cricket World Cup saw him sidelined for many months. However, he fought his way back into the side with a string of good scores in domestic cricket for his club, Nondescripts. A calm and cool player in a <b>crisis</b> <b>situation,</b> Arnold has dragged Sri Lanka out of many sticky situations. He is highly valued for his gritty qualities and is considered an unselfish team man. He is considered an ideal No. 6; he is a Methodist Christian of Tamil descent as is Muttiah Muralitharan.|$|E
25|$|In Winter 1943 Gottlieb Duttweiler and the Migros-Genossenschafts-Bund, Zürich, {{withdrew from}} the {{shipping}} company Maritime Suisse S.A. originally planned to establish the Merchant Marine of Switzerland during World War II. Nevertheless, {{the creation of a}} shipping company with initially three Victory and three Liberty ships, sailing on a regular liner service between the USA and the Mediterranean Sea, never was realized. The shipping company Reederei Zürich AG was founded on 26 July 1951, and immediately two fast freighters were ordered from the shipyard H. C. Stülcken, Hamburg: Adele, named after Duttweiler's wife Adele Duttweiler, and Amelia, named after Göner's wife Amelia Göhner. Each unit was valued to 5,0 Mio. DM without the main engines which were ordered separately from Gebrüder Sulzer, Winterthur, for a total price of 3,75 Mio. CHF. The Swiss government financed 75% of the building costs under the terms, that during a <b>crisis</b> <b>situation,</b> the vessels would be immediately put at the government's disposal. Some of the Swiss parliamentarians, but also Swiss news papers were disturbed about the English prefix SUN {{in the name of a}} Swiss ship, and other were indignant with the charterers. In February 1966 the time charter of SUNADELE with Saguenay was terminated and later sold; SUNAMELIA remained in the Saguenay charter until 31 December 1968 until she was sold in February 1970.|$|E

Heavy casualties {{since the start of}} Operation Overlord resulted in a critical shortage of infantry replacements even before the <b>crisis</b> <b>situation</b> created by the Ardennes Offensive. Steps were taken to divert men from Communications Zone units. The commander of the Communication Zone, Lieutenant General John C. H.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Doctor Who Magazine, actor Tom Price states {{that one of the}} original producers had originally wanted to kill Andy off in the first series as he was such a peripheral character. Executive producer Julie Gardner felt that it suited to have Andy return later in the series as it maintains a sense of continuity. She believes that there's a palpable relationship between Gwen and Andy. Director Brian Kelly opines that it makes perfect sense for Andy to return in episode thirteen as [...] "he is the person who would phone Gwen" [...] in a <b>crisis</b> <b>situation.</b> Eve Myles, who portrays Gwen, believes that Price conveys the humorous aspects of Andy's character [...] "fantastically", which enables her as an actress to understand the friendship between the characters. Myles also feels that Andy plays a crucial part in reminding viewers of Gwen's development; when he reappears [...] "it takes you right back to the beginning, it reminds you where she came from, how Jack found Gwen". Price enumerates that by the second series Andy is used by the production team as a [...] "pressure valve" [...] to relieve tension.|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} my thesis was {{published}} {{with the title}} of local government activities and a proposal of the methodological approach {{in dealing with the}} disruption of food supplies. The objective of my thesis was to outline the local government and also to focus on its activities. It also describes the basic principles of emergency planning as part of preparatory measures for dealing with <b>crisis</b> <b>situations,</b> including <b>crisis</b> <b>situations</b> with the disruption of food supplies with large-scale consequences. My thesis also contains a general overview of the economic measures for <b>crisis</b> <b>situations,</b> which includes regulatory measures. The regulatory measures are a central subject of my thesis research. The objective of my thesis was to create a proposal of the methodological approach in dealing with the disruption of food supplies. A presumptive hypothesis was subsequently formed for this objective. This thesis is classified as a theoretical type of qualifying work. This type of thesis is accompanied by a formative evaluation as a minimum. An essential basis for the work on this thesis was a relevant and rich source base. This platform was used for performing a comparison of published literary sources, current legislation, methodological proposals and procedures related to this issue. Based on analytical and critical approach, the data acquired was assessed and processed into a draft methodological guide. The draft methodological approach in dealing with the disruption of food supplies consists of two basic parts. The methodological guide is intended for local authorities that can use it in their planning documents for dealing with emergencies and <b>crisis</b> <b>situations.</b> The proposed methodology should help local governments in dealing with <b>crisis</b> <b>situations</b> with food supply disruptions and simplify orientation in the issue of economic measures for <b>crisis</b> <b>situations,</b> which include regulatory measures. It would be suitable to inform local authorities about the issue of economic measures for <b>crisis</b> <b>situations,</b> focusing on regulatory measures concerning the solutions to <b>crisis</b> <b>situations</b> with food supply disruptions with large-scale consequences, through training and professional seminars on the issue...|$|R

2500|$|Ray Nagin : Incumbent mayor Ray Nagin sought re-election. [...] Before Katrina, he {{was widely}} {{perceived}} {{as having a}} very high chance of re-election, but the new political climate left his level of support uncertain. [...] Nagin faced strong criticism of his handling of Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath. [...] Many middle- and upper-class white voters, who supported him in the 2002 election and were vital to his success in that contest, were alienated by his ‘chocolate city’ speech in January 2006, and very few white voters supported him this time. [...] The elements {{of the business community}} that were such an important part of his support base in 2002 mainly supported other candidates, while Nagin's business-oriented plans for reconstruction in New Orleans have alienated many voters. [...] Moreover, the city’s black majority has been significantly reduced, and many in the city’s black community were critical of Nagin even before the hurricane, citing amongst other issues {{the fact that he was}} known to have conservative politics and had supported Republican candidates in the past. [...] Nagin campaigned on his experience as mayor and in defense of his record, arguing that New Orleans needs experienced leadership in a <b>crisis</b> <b>situation.</b> [...] After being defeated in the primary, Rob Couhig, Virginia Boulet, and Tom Watson endorsed Nagin in the runoff.|$|E
