We study timing effects of carbon mitigation and solar radiation management (SRM) policies for correlated pollutants, CO₂ and SO₂. We show that national levels of carbon and sulfur emissions quotas and SRM implementation are positively correlated with each other. First-mover advantages exist when deciding both <b>carbon</b> <b>quotas</b> and SRM levels. Moreover, we use an example to illustrate that if international equity is considered, governments {{would be willing to}} choose SRM levels before <b>carbon</b> <b>quotas</b> since it yields higher payoffs and less acid rain and droughts damages.

Here we investigated the physiological performance of a highly calcified E. huxleyi strain, NZEH, in a multiparametric experiment. Cells were exposed to different CO 2 levels (ranging from 250 to 1314 &# 181;atm) under three nutrient conditions [nutrient replete (R), nitrate limited (-N) and phosphate limited (-P) ]. We focused on calcite and organic <b>carbon</b> <b>quotas</b> and on nitrate and phosphate utilization by analyzing the activity of nitrate reductase (NRase) and alkaline phosphatase (APase), respectively. Particulate inorganic (PIC) and organic (POC) <b>carbon</b> <b>quotas</b> increased with increasing CO 2 under R conditions but a different pattern was observed under nutrient limitation. The PIC:POC ratio decreased with increasing CO 2 in nutrient limited cultures. Coccolith length increased with CO 2 under all nutrient conditions but the coccosphere volume varied depending on the nutrient treatment. Maximum APase activity was found at 561 &# 181;atm of CO 2 (pH 7. 92) in -P cultures and in R conditions, NRase activity increased linearly with CO 2. These results suggest that E. huxleyi’s competitive ability for nutrient uptake might be altered in future high-CO 2 oceans.

We translate this global <b>carbon</b> <b>quota</b> to regional and national scales, on a spectrum of sharing principles that extends from continuation of the present distribution of emissions to an equal per-capita distribution of cumulative emissions.

For a <b>carbon</b> <b>quota</b> consistent with a 2 °C warming limit (relative to pre-industrial levels), the necessary long-term mitigation rates are very challenging (typically over 5 % per year), both because of strong limits on future emissions from the global <b>carbon</b> <b>quota</b> and also the likely short-term persistence in emissions growth in many regions...|$|R
40|$|This paper employs {{analytical}} and numerical general equilibrium models {{to assess the}} efficiency impacts of two policies to reduce U. S. carbon emissions — a revenue-neutral carbon tax and a non-auctioned <b>carbon</b> <b>quota</b> — {{taking into account the}} interactions between these policies and pre-existing tax distortions in factor markets. We show that tax interactions significantly raise the costs of both policies relative to what they would be in a first-best setting. In addition, we show that these interactions put the <b>carbon</b> <b>quota</b> at a significant efficiency disadvantage relative to the carbon tax: for example, the costs of reducing emissions by 10 percent are more than three times as high under the <b>carbon</b> <b>quota</b> as under the carbon tax. This disadvantage reflects the inability of the quota policy to generate revenue {{that can be used to}} reduce pre-existing distortionary taxes. Indeed, second-best considerations can limit the potential of a <b>carbon</b> <b>quota</b> to generate overall efficiency gains. Under our central values for parameters, a non-auctioned <b>carbon</b> <b>quota</b> (or set of grandfathered carbon emissions permits) cannot increase efficiency unless the marginal benefits from avoided future climate change are at least $ 17. 8 per ton of carbon abatement. Most estimates of marginal environmental benefits are below this level. Thus, our analysis suggests that any carbon abatement by way of a non-auctioned quota will reduce efficiency. In contrast, our analysis indicates that a revenue-neutral carbon tax can be efficiency-improving so long as marginal environmental benefits are positive. ...|$|R

China is the biggest carbon emissions country in the world. In order to solve this problem, implementation of an innovative policy is necessary. Personal carbon trading (PCT) is latest idea on the subject of new policy to control the carbon emission. But whether a new policy can be implemented, it depends on its public acceptability. In this article we discussed public acceptability of PCT by exploring the influencing factors and its level of acceptance in China. We designed a questionnaire with five aspects to collect data from three main cities of China. We applied ordinal logistic regression model to investigate the factors which influence public acceptability.

40|$|Abstract — Global warming has {{compelled}} us {{to reduce}} carbon dioxide emissions. To prevent climate change, {{in the coming}} future a carbon budget will be set for each country, and in turn the country will sell <b>carbon</b> <b>quotas</b> to companies. Companies can also buy or sell their quotas with each other. In other words, companies {{have to pay for}} the carbon dioxide emissions. In effect, it will deeply influence the whole supply chain of a company including sourcing, producing and distributing processes. Nowadays, with globalization, many multi-national companies deploy their manufacturing base in Asia where the production cost is low, and then transport products to major consuming markets viz U. S. and Western Europe either by sea or by air. Therefore this mode requires global oceangoing ships or long-haul flights, which consume fuel and generate carbon dioxide emissions. However, with the carbon quota or extra cost for consuming energy that will be further reflected in the corresponding price, the current mode will be significantly changed to adapt for the new constraint. Except the delivery cost adjusted by carbon quota, carbon charge will also affect the producing and storing processes, for both of them need energy consumption as well as greenhouse gas emissions. In short, the supply chain of a company is forced to be redesigned to conform to the carbon reduction obligation. This research aims to investigate the impacts of <b>carbon</b> <b>quotas</b> on supply chain management. Analytic models will be constructed to describe the trade-offs in supply chain when carbon quota is further considered. Numerical experiments will be conducted to examine the optimal solution to minimize the expected total cost. Keywords-Carbon quota, Supply chain management, Global Warmin...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{establishes}} an agent-based simulation {{system of}} the carbon emissions trading {{in accordance with the}} complex feature of the trading process. This system analyzes the impact of the <b>carbon</b> <b>quota</b> allocation mechanism on emissions trading for three different aspects including the amount of emissions reduction, the economic effect on the emitters, and the emissions reduction cost. Based on the data of the carbon emissions of different industries in China, several simulations were made. The results indicate that the emissions trading policy can effectively reduce carbon emissions in a perfectly competitive market. Moreover, by comparing separate quota allocation mechanisms, we obtain the result that the scheme with a small extent quota decrease in a comprehensive allocation mechanism can minimize the unit carbon emission cost. Implementing this scheme can also achieve minimal effects of carbon emissions limitation on the economy on the basis that the environment is not destroyed. However, excessive quota decrease cannot promote the emitters to reduce emission. Taking into account that several developing countries have the dual task of limiting carbon emissions and developing the economy, it is necessary to adopt a comprehensive allocation mechanism of the <b>carbon</b> <b>quota</b> and increase the initial proportion of free allocation...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate interactive effects of OA and dynamic light, mimicking natural mixing regimes. - The Antarctic diatom Chaetoceros debilis was grown under two pCO 2 (390 and 1000 latm) and light conditions (constant and dynamic), the latter yielding the same integrated irradiance over the day. To characterize interactive effects between treatments, growth, elemental composition, primary production and photophysiology were investigated. - Dynamic light reduced growth and strongly altered the effects of OA on primary production, being unaffected by elevated pCO 2 under constant light, yet significantly reduced under dynamic light. Interactive effects between OA and light were also observed for Chl production and particulate organic <b>carbon</b> <b>quotas.</b> - Response patterns can be explained by changes in the cellular energetic balance. While the energy transfer efficiency from photochemistry to biomass production (Φe,C) was not affected by OA under constant light, it was drastically reduced under dynamic light.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the consequences of}} alternative CO 2 emission reduction strategies on economic development and, in particular, the implications for the poor by empirically implementing an economy-wide model for India over a 35 -year time horizon. A multi-sectoral, inter-temporal model in the activity analysis framework is used for this purpose. The model with specific technological alternatives, endogenous income distribution, truly dynamic behaviour and covering the whole economy is an integrated top-down bottom-up model. The results show that CO 2 emission reduction imposes costs in terms of lower GDP and higher poverty. Cumulative emission reduction targets are, however, preferable to annual reduction targets and that a dynamically optimum strategy can help reduce the burden of emission reductions. The scenarios involving compensation for the loss in welfare are not very encouraging as they require large capital inflows. Contrasted with these, scenarios involving tradable emission quota give India an incentive to be carbon efficient. It becomes a net seller for the first 25 years and because of reduction in carbon intensity it would demand less in later years when it becomes a net buyer. The results suggest that for India, and other developing countries, {{the window of opportunity}} to sell <b>carbon</b> <b>quotas</b> is the next two decades or so. ...|$|E

From samples of the bacillariophyte Asterionella formosa, the chrysophyte Chromulina sp., the cryptophyte Cryptomonas ovata and the zygnematophyte Cosmarium botrytis we first separated glycolipids (monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, digalactosyldiacylglycerol, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol), phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanol-amine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine) as well as non-polar lipids (triacylglycerols), before analyzing the fatty acid composition of each lipid class. High variation in the fatty acid composition existed among different species. Individual fatty acid compositions differed in their reaction to changing light intensities in the four species.

40|$|Iron {{availability}} strongly {{governs the}} growth of Southern Ocean phytoplankton. To investigate how iron limitation affects photosynthesis {{as well as the}} uptake of carbon and iron in the Antarctic diatom Chaetoceros simplex, a combination of chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements and radiotracer incubations in the presence and absence of chemical inhibitors was conducted. Iron limitation in C. simplex led to a decline in growth rates, photochemical efficiency and structural changes in photosystem II (PSII), including a reorganisation of photosynthetic units in PSII and an increase in size of the functional absorption cross section of PSII. Iron-limited cells further exhibited a reduced plastoquinone pool and decreased photosynthetic electron transport rate, while non-photochemical quenching and relative xanthophyll pigment content were strongly increased, suggesting a photoprotective response. Additionally, iron limitation resulted in a strong decline in carbon fixation and thus the particulate organic <b>carbon</b> <b>quotas.</b> Inhibitor studies demonstrated that, independent of the iron supply, carbon fixation was dependent on internal, but not on extracellular carbonic anhydrase activity. Orthovanadate more strongly inhibited iron uptake in iron-limited cells, indicating that P-type ATPase transporters are involved in iron uptake. The stronger reduction in iron uptake by ascorbate in iron-limited cells suggests that the re-oxidation of iron is required before it can be taken up and further supports the presence of a high-affinity iron transport pathway. The measured changes to photosystem architecture and shifts in carbon and iron uptake strategies in C. simplex as a result of iron limitation provide evidence for a complex interaction of these processes to balance the iron requirements for photosynthesis and carbon demand for sustained growth in iron-limited waters. ...|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change and}} its {{possible}} detrimental effects {{are among the}} most widely debated issues of our time. Deforestation and forest degradation may account for nearly 20 % of the global emissions. Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) & has therefore been launched as a global framework. Efforts made by wealthier factions of the international community to initiate a system of payments to governments and local people in the South for not cutting trees, aim to reduce deforestation and forest degradation. What does this grand, global framework look like when implemented in different areas of the world? This thesis attempts to paint a picture of what REDD looks like on the ground in Zanzibar, drawing upon fieldwork conducted on Unguja Island, Zanzibar in East Africa. My data is based both on a long-term village stay and constant contact and interaction with the implementers of the REDD pilot project HIMA Hifadhi ya Misitu ya Asili (Conservation of Natural Forests) - Piloting REDD in Zanzibar through Community Forest Management throughout my fieldwork. In this thesis I argue that there are aspects of the HIMA stakeholders characteristics and relationships which can provide possibilities for the accomplishment of the HIMA project and REDD in Zanzibar. That said, I believe lack of other sufficient income opportunities which could substitute the sale of forest products for the villagers, will make it hard to achieve a decrease in deforestation. If the business of forest products is in fact successfully limited it seems unlikely that villagers will be appropriately compensated, especially since the possible REDD money Zanzibar can attract through sales of <b>carbon</b> <b>quotas</b> is not expected to be substantial enough for money to be distributed to individuals. In this thesis I am also concerned with how commercial logging is viewed by the implementers as a place-bound activity which happens in rural communities. I argue that not enough attention is being paid to urban demand for firewood and charcoal as well as other external factors. By following specific firewood {{all the way from the}} forest through the sale processes to end use as cooking fuel, I identify urban and rural people involved in the business. These local middle-men, drivers, and conductors could lose a substantial part of their income as a result of the HIMA project. Yet, they themselves are also integral to the success of the project.

Reconstructing pCO 2 is therefore {{one of the}} major challenges for the scientific community today. This thesis aims at investigating if past pCO 2 can be reconstructed based on the carbon isotopic composition of dinoflagellates. In order to do so, experiments were carried out with four dinoflagellate species and correlations between the carbon isotopic composition in the dinoflagellates and the CO 2 concentrations in the growth medium were determined. Next to CO 2, nitrogen concentration and light availabilities were modified and thereby their influences on the carbon isotopic fractionation were tested. Furthermore, inorganic carbon fluxes were measured by means of membrane inlet mass spectrometry. Such in vivo assays allowed for estimating the preferred inorganic carbon source (i. e. bicarbonate or CO 2) and the degree of CO 2 efflux/leakage during photosynthesis, both key determinants for carbon isotope fractionation. My results show a general positive correlation of dinoflagellate carbon isotopic fractionation with CO 2 availability. In addition to CO 2, carbon isotopic fractionation was found to be affected by growth rates and particulate organic <b>carbon</b> <b>quotas.</b> Accounting for these growth parameters improved the correlations significantly in most species. However, these correlations were found for dinoflagellates grown under replete conditions. Reduced light levels showed comparable CO 2 dependencies, but increased the overall carbon isotopic fractionation in one species, while under nitrogen limitation no CO 2 dependency was observed. Results of in vivo assays showed that carbon isotopic composition in dinoflagellates was influenced by CO 2 because increased CO 2 availability decreased the relative uptake rates of bicarbonate, i. e. the inorganic carbon species containing more 13 C compared to CO 2, and increased leakage, i. e. the amount of CO 22 diffusing out of the cell in relation to total inorganic carbon uptake, thereby preventing the accumulation of 13 C. Results of this thesis are promising with respect to proxy development. However, measuring CO 2 dependencies of the carbon isotopic composition in dinoflagellates under higher CO 2 concentrations than tested here, and estimating the potential influence of other environmental factors than nitrogen and light, besides CO 2, are important next steps. In addition, it remains to be tested whether there is an isotopic offset between the carbon isotopic composition of the dinoflagellate cells and the dinoflagellate cysts. Such experiments could not be performed within the frame of this thesis but should certainly be considered in future work to allow an eventual application of the proxy...|$|E

We first construct a basic multi-period risk optimization model for the fashion retailer and illustrate how its optimal solution can be determined by solving a simpler problem. Then, we analytically find that the optimal ordering quantity is increasing in the expected profit target, decreasing in the number of periods of the season, and increasing in the market interest rate. After that, we propose and solve several extended models which consider realistic and timely industrial measures such as minimum ordering quantity, carbon emission tax, and <b>carbon</b> <b>quota.</b> We analytically derive the necessary and sufficient condition(s) for the existence of the optimal solution for each model and show how the purchasing budget, the profit target, and the market interest rate affect the optimal solution. Finally, we investigate the supply chain coordination challenge and analytically illustrate how an upstream manufacturer can offer implementable supply contracts to optimize the supply chain.

40|$|Coccolithophores, {{a diverse}} group of phytoplankton, make {{important}} contributions to pelagic calcite production and export, yet the comparative biogeochemical role of species other than the ubiquitous Emiliania huxleyi is poorly understood. Here we examined the relative importance of E. huxleyi and two Coccolithus species (Coccolithus pelagicus and Coccolithus braarudii), in terms of daily calcite production, by culturing E. huxleyi and Coccolithus in parallel, and comparing growth rates and biometrically determined cellular <b>carbon</b> calcite <b>quotas.</b> Biometric measurements of Coccolithus species, and E. huxleyi cell diameters, were performed using polarised light microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy was used for all other biometric measurements of E. huxleyi...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{estimate}} the effects of pollution charges, ash handling and of the <b>carbon</b> dioxide <b>quota</b> trade on the competitiveness of natural gas, oil shale, peat and wood chips in Estonia for 2010 and 2015. The pollution charges and levels are calculated based on the Environmental Charges Act, and Regulations No 99 / 2004 and No 94 / 2004 of the Estonian Minister of the Environment. The calculations show a considerable change in the cost competitiveness of fuels. Fuel related costs of the fossil fuels with high CO 2 emission factors and other environmental impacts may be doubled...|$|R
