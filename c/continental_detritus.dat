40|$|ABSTRACT: It is {{suggested}} (1) that large amounts ofA 1, Fe and Si carried in solution by fresh water are chemically precipitated as hydroxide gels in the brackish water environment of estuaries and deltas, and (2) that these gels are subsequently deposited {{in both the}} brackish water environment and in the neighbouring seas, where they become parental material for the neoformation f clay minerals, and various other silicate and iron minerals. The types of neoformed minerals will depend upon both the com-position of the parental gels and the physico-chemical milieu of their crystallization. Evidence is discussed supporting this hypothesis from the following sources (1) the concentrations of A 1, Fe and Si dissolved in fresh water and in sea-water, (2) experi-mental work on the crystallization of alumino-siliceous gels, and (3) {{a study of the}} precipitation of Si from the waters of the Mississippi River delta. Because of the unusual sediment pattern of present times, this source of neoformed clay minerals and other minerals contributes only a small proportion of the sediments of the brackish parts of estuaries, deltas and the adjacent seas, which are dominated by fine-grained <b>continental</b> <b>detritus.</b> In earlier geological eras, when the world's river systems carried only relatively minor amounts of fine-grained <b>continental</b> <b>detritus,</b> this source of neoformed minerals i likely to have contributed a considerable proportion of the fine-grained sediments of these areas of sedimentation.

40|$|Under {{suitable}} conditions, magnetofossils (the inorganic {{remains of}} magnetotactic bacteria) {{can contribute to}} the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of sediments. In recent years, magnetofossils {{have been shown to be}} preserved commonly in marine sediments, which makes it essential to quantify their importance in palaeomagnetic recording. In this study, we examine a deep-sea sediment core from offshore of northwestern Western Australia. The magnetic mineral assemblage is dominated by <b>continental</b> <b>detritus</b> and magnetite magnetofossils. By separating magnetofossil and detrital components based on their different demagnetization characteristics, it is possible to quantify their respective contributions to the sedimentary NRM throughout the Brunhes chron. In the studied core, the contribution of magnetofossils to the NRM is controlled by large-scale climate changes, with their relative importance increasing during glacial periods when detrital inputs were low. Our results demonstrate that magnetite magnetofossils can dominate sedimentary NRMs in settings where they are preserved in significant abundances...|$|E
40|$|Non-collisional, {{convergent}} margin orogens {{are generally}} called accretionary orogens, although {{there may not}} have been horizontal accretion across the plate boundary. We revive the term non-collisional orogen and use a Gondwanaland perspective to discuss different types. On the northern margin of the Australian Plate, the New Guinea non-collisional, accretionary orogen was formed by large-scale terrane accretion across an advancing plate margin. On the eastern margin, the Southwest Pacific Orogen is a non-collisional and non-accretionary orogen, involving virtually no horizontal transfer of material across its eastward-retreating plate boundary. In the Tasmanides, the Lachlan Orogen, commonly described as an accretionary orogen, is another non-collisional, non-accretionary orogen developed behind the plate margin after major Cambrian rollback, with resultant backarc basins filled mainly by quartz-rich turbidites subsequently recycled. The outboard New England Orogen is a non-collisional but accretionary orogen, marked by the frontal accretion of <b>continental</b> margin arc <b>detritus,</b> subsequently recycled into younger arcs. The Permian to Cretaceous Rangitata Orogen of New Zealand is an ?oblique non-collisional, accretionary orogen in which Permian–Triassic sediments of the accretionary wedge have no link with inboard (near) arc terranes. Late Jurassic to Cretaceous parts were sourced by a combination of first cycle volcanogenic detritus passing through the forearc basin together with recycling of the exhumed parts of the wedge. All non-collisional orogens involve continental growth, but only the New England Orogen {{and to a lesser extent}} the New Guinea Orogen involve significant crustal growth. 44 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Phosphorites {{from the}} Murray Ridge, NW Arabian Sea {{comprise}} nodules, bioclasts, and bone fragments. The nodules {{are made up}} of a homogeneous, light-colored phosphate nucleus consisting of Rivulariacean filamentous cyanobacteria and a thin dark-grey colored phosphate cortex showing abundant microbial filaments and microborings. The bioclasts comprise ~ 14 - 14. 5 Ma old planktonic foraminifers, accepted as the time of deposition. Spherical to ovoid-shaped apatite microparticles resembling fossil bacteria are distinct components in the bioclasts. Bone fragments exhibit apatite fillings. The nodules and bone fragments consist entirely of carbonate fluorapatite with low Al, K, and Th concentrations suggesting absence of <b>continental</b> <b>detritus.</b> Shale-normalized REE patterns of the samples support a seawater-derived composition. The highly uniform initial εNd values of- 4. 8 to- 5. 1 are interpreted as the seawater value at the onset of phosphatization ~ 14 Ma ago. In contrast, 87 Sr / 86 Sr ratios show a large range of 0. 709055 to 0. 709124 corresponding to unusually young stratigraphic ages of ~ 1 to 3 Ma. The data are interpreted as evidence for post-depositional Sr-exchange of the recrystallizing phosphorites with fluids isotopically not much different from modern seawater. It is concluded that the phosphorites formed under oxic, shallow-water conditions where microbial populations assimilated phosphorus primarily from seawater and mediated precipitation of CFA during early diagenesis at the sediment-water interface on different substrates...|$|E

40|$|Geological reconstructions {{and general}} {{circulation}} models {{suggest that the}} onset of both Northern Hemisphere glaciation, 2. 7 Myr ago, and convection of Labrador Sea Water (LSW) were caused by {{the closure of the}} Panama Gateway ~ 4. 5 Myr ago. Time series data that have been obtained from studies of ferromanganese crusts from the northwestern Atlantic suggest that radiogenic isotopes of intermediate ocean residence time (Pb and Nd) can serve as suitable tracers to reconstruct these events. However, it has been unclear until now as to whether the changes that have been observed in isotope composition at this time are the result of increased thermohaline circulation or due to the effects of increased glacial weathering. In this paper we adopt a box model approach to demonstrate that the shifts in radiogenic isotope compositions are unlikely to be due to changes in convection in LSW but can be explained in terms of increases of erosion levels due to the glaciation of Greenland and Canada. Furthermore, we provide experimental evidence for the incongruent release of a labile fraction of strongly radiogenic Pb and nonradiogenic Nd from <b>continental</b> <b>detritus</b> eroding into the Labrador Sea. This {{can be attributed to the}} glacial weathering of old continents and accounts for the paradox that one of the areas of the world most deficient in radiogenic Pb should provide such a rich supply of radiogenic Pb to the oceans. An important general conclusion is that the compositions of radiogenic isotopes in seawater are not always a reflection of their continental sources. Perhaps more importantly, the transition from chemical weathering to mechanical erosion is likely to result in significant variations in radiogenic tracers in seawater...|$|E
40|$|The {{origin and}} {{continuity}} of Phanerozoic lithostratigraphic terranes in southern and Baja California remain an unsolved issue in Cordilleran tectonics. We present data from eight detrital zircon samples collected across the southern {{extent of the}} Peninsular Ranges that help constrain the provenance of detritus and the depositional ages of these basement units. Detrital zircon signatures from units in the eastern Peninsular Ranges correlate with Palaeozoic passive margin assemblages in the southwestern North American Cordillera. Units in the central belt, which consists of Triassic–Jurassic metasedimentary turbidite assemblages that probably deformed in an accretionary prism setting, and Cretaceous metasedimentary and metavolcanic units that represent {{the remnants of a}} continental margin arc, were derived from both proximal and more distal sources. The westernmost units, which are locally structurally interleaved with the Triassic through Cretaceous units of the central belt, are Cretaceous deposits that represent a series of collapsed basin complexes located within and flanking the Cretaceous Alisitos volcanic island arc. Cretaceous intra-arc units show little influx of cratonal material until approximately 110 Ma, whereas coeval sediments on the northern and eastern flanks of the Alisitos arc contain abundant cratonal detritus. Intra-arc strata younger than approximately 110 Ma contain large amounts of Proterozoic and older detrital zircons. These data suggest that basins associated with the Alisitos arc were either too distant or somehow shielded from North American detritus before 110 Ma. In the case of the former, increased influx of <b>continental</b> <b>detritus</b> after 110 Ma would support a tectonic model in which the arc was separated from North America by an ocean basin and, as the arc approached the continent, associated depositional centres were close enough to receive input from continental sources...|$|E
40|$|Mudrocks {{from three}} lower Paleozoic basins in the British Caledonides (southern Lake District, {{northern}} Lake District and Southern Uplands) were investigated {{to determine the}} influence of sub-greenschist facies metamorphism on Li and the factors that control Li in fine-grained terrigenous sedimentary rocks. Metamorphic grade, as determined by KI (Kübler index) does not correlate with Li content ([Li]) and δ 7 Li, indicating that sub-greenschist facies metamorphism has negligible effect on Li in these rocks. Collectively, the data for all three basins show a negative correlation between [Li] and δ 7 Li and a positive correlation between [Li] and the Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA), suggesting that provenance exerts the greatest control on Li in mudrocks. Samples from the northern Lake District, which were deposited in an extensional basin, have homogeneous REE patterns, similar to shale composites (PAAS), the highest CIA, Th/U and [Li] and the lowest δ 7 Li and εNd, consistent with their derivation from a highly weathered, ancient continental source. By contrast, mudrocks from the Southern Uplands range to the lowest CIA, Th/U and [Li] and have the highest δ 7 Li and εNd. These samples were deposited in a forearc basin on the southern margin of the Laurentian craton and contain volcanic detritus. Their REE patterns are the most variable, ranging from average shale-like patterns to less LREE-enriched patterns. The compositional heterogeneity within the Southern Uplands mudrocks is consistent with a mixed provenance that includes juvenile crustal materials (lower [Li], εNd and Th/U, higher δ 7 Li), likely derived from the arc, as well as more highly weathered <b>continental</b> <b>detritus.</b> Mudrocks from the southern Lake District were deposited in a foreland basin, and exhibit geochemical characteristics intermediate between the northern Lake District and the Southern Uplands mudrocks, indicating their derivation from a mixed source. Our study shows that Li concentrations and δ 7 Li can provide additional information on the degree of weathering of the provenance of mudrocks...|$|E
40|$|Tectonic {{models of}} the {{evolution}} of the inter-American region show that induced subduction initiation/polarity reversal is required in order to isolate the Caribbean as a separate plate. However, the timing and mechanism of this subduction initiation/reversal are still controversial. In order to shed light on this issue we investigate the geochemistry of arc-derived, ~ 80 Ma, basic to acidic igneous rocks from the Main Ridge Formation (MRF) in central Jamaica. The affinity of the mantle component in the MRF arc rocks can help increase our understanding of the initiation of any new subduction zone in the inter-American region. Trace element geochemistry demonstrates that the MRF mantle source component was N-MORB-like. Conversely, younger circum-Caribbean arc rocks (≤ 75 Ma) have a more enriched plume-like mantle component. Unfortunately, when considering the slab component, some of the most useful trace elements {{that can be used to}} identify the affinity of a slab flux in arc lavas (e. g., Ba) have been mobilised by subsolidus alteration processes in the MRF. Consequently, the immobile element Th/La–(Ce/Ce*) Nd discrimination diagram is proposed as a method of determining the affinity of slab components from altered igneous rocks. This diagram identifies sedimentary slab components that have potentially contaminated an arc source region, e. g., <b>continental</b> <b>detritus,</b> volcanic detritus, hydrogenous Fe–Mn oxides, fish debris-rich clay and hydrothermal sediments. In this study, the Th/La–(Ce/Ce*) Nd diagram suggests that the slab component in most of the MRF samples has a composition similar to continental detritus/GLOSS II. Additionally, several MRF samples are derived from a source region that has been fluxed with a subduction component, in part, composed of fish debris and hydrothermal sediments. These results help constrain the timing and mechanism of Cretaceous subduction initiation in the inter-American region. The geochemical components recognised in the MRF rocks support a Turonian–Campanian (93. 5 – 70. 6 Ma) model of intra-Caribbean induced subduction polarity reversal that resulted from the collision of the Caribbean oceanic plateau with an inter-American arc system (the Great Arc of the Caribbean) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{sedimentary}} and basaltic inputs of lithium to subduction zones. Various sediments from DSDP and ODP drill cores {{in front of the}} Mariana, South Sandwich, Banda, East Sunda and Lesser Antilles island arcs have been analysed and show highly variable Li contents and d 7 Li values. The sediment piles in front of the Mariana and South Sandwich arcs largely consist of pelagic sediments (clays and oozes). The pelagic clays have high Li contents (up to 57. 3 ppm) and Li isotope compositions ranging from + 1. 3 ? to + 4. 1 ?. The oozes have lower Li contents (7. 3 - 16 ppm) with d 7 Li values of the diatom oozes from the South Sandwich lower (+ 2. 8 ? to + 3. 2 ?) than those of the radiolarian oozes from the Mariana arc (+ 8. 1 ? to + 14. 5 ?). Mariana sediment also contains a significant portion of volcanogenic material, which is characterised by a moderate Li content (14 ppm) and a relatively heavy isotope composition (+ 6. 4 ?). Sediments from the Banda and Lesser Antilles contain considerable amounts of <b>continental</b> <b>detritus,</b> and have high Li contents (up to 74. 3 ppm) and low d 7 Li values (around 0 ?), caused by weathering of continental bedrock. East Sunda sediments largely consist of calcareous oozes. These carbonate sediments display intermediate to high Li contents (2. 4 - 41. 9 ppm) and highly variable d 7 Li values (- 1. 6 ? to + 12. 8 ?). Basaltic oceanic crust samples from worldwide DSDP and ODP drill cores are characterised by enrichment of Li compared to fresh MORB (6. 6 - 33. 1 vs. 3. 6 - 7. 5 ppm, respectively), and show a large range in Li isotope compositions (+ 1. 7 ? to + 11. 8 ?). The elemental and isotopic enrichment of Li in altered basalts is due to the uptake of isotopically heavy seawater Li during weathering. However, old oceanic crust samples from Sites 417 / 418 exhibit lighter Li isotope compositions compared to young basaltic crust samples from Sites 332 B and 504 B. This lighter Li isotope signature in old crust is unexpected and {{further research is needed to}} explore this issue...|$|E
40|$|We have {{determined}} the concentrations and isotopic compositions of Sr and Nd in hydrothermal fluids from 21 °N, East Pacific Rise and Guaymas Basin, Gulf of California. The purest solutions analyzed from 21 °N exhibit a small range in Sr concentration between individual vents from 5. 8 to 8. 7 ppm, close to normal seawater Sr concentrations. They exhibit a small range in ^(87) Sr/^(86) Sr from ε_(Sr) (0) = − 13. 4 to − 17. 7, corresponding to ε_(Sr) (0) ≈ − 18 ± 2 in the pure hydrothermal end-member. These results indicate extensive but not complete isotopic exchange with Sr in the depleted oceanic crust (ε _(Sr) (0) = − 31. 8) {{and suggest that}} Sr concentrations in these solutions are buffered. In contrast, the concentration and isotopic composition of Nd in solutions show large variations between vents. The concentration of Nd ranges from 20 to 336 pg/g (6 – 100 times seawater Nd concentrations). The isotopic composition ranges from ε_(Nd) (0) = − 3. 6 (similar to Pacific seawater) to + 7. 9. Many samples show substantial contributions from MORB, but all have ε_(Nd) (0) well below MORB at this locality (ε_(Nd) (0) = + 9. 7) in spite of very large enrichments in Nd concentrations. While complete isotopic exchange with water/rock≈ 2 or exchange with anomalous oceanic crust can explain the Sr data, the Nd data require exchange with a reservoir having ε_(Nd) (0) < Pacific seawater. Low-temperature reactions with metalliferous sediments on the ridge flanks may provide such a source. Both Sr and Nd in the Guaymas Basin solution {{are very different from}} 21 °N. ε_(Sr) (0) = + 11. 0 and ε_(Nd) (0) = − 11. 4 and are consistent with the fluid exchanging Sr and Nd with heated sediments having a substantial component of old <b>continental</b> <b>detritus.</b> Some irregularities in the Nd isotopic data reported here indicate that there must be a problem of contamination for some ultra-low-level trace elements during sample collection and processing which requires further attention. Using a simple box model, the estimates for hydrothermal Nd fluxes are compared with fluxes which would be required to maintain the relatively radiogenic value of ε_(Nd) (0) ≈ − 3 in the Pacific against the influx of more negative Antarctic waters (ε_(Nd) (0) ≈ − 9). It is shown that the hydrothermal flux of Nd from mid-ocean ridges falls far short of that necessary to maintain the isotopic balance. This indicates that weathered material from volcanic terranes (ε_(Nd) (0) ≈ + 7) is the most reasonable major source of radiogenic Nd in the Pacific...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of establishing Nd isotopic variations in seawater over geologic time. Calcite, aragonite and apatite are examined as possible phases recording seawater values of ϵ_(Nd). Modern, biogenic and inorganically precipitated calcite and aragonite from marine environments {{were found to have}} Nd concentrations of from 0. 2 to 70 ppb, showing that primary marine CaCO_ 3 contains little REE and that Nd/Ca is not greatly enhanced relative to seawater during carbonate precipitation. Very young marine limestone and dolomite containing no <b>continental</b> <b>detritus</b> have 200 ppb Nd. All the carbonates are LREE enriched (- 0. 16 ≤ƒ^(Sm/Nd) ≤- 0. 45). Modern and very young Atlantic and Pacific carbonates have ϵ_(Nd) in the range of shallow Atlantic and Pacific seawater respectively, implying that they derive their REE from local seawater. The Nd in well preserved carbonate fossils is ≤ 4 × 10 ^ 4 ppb, much greater than in their modern counterparts but like the high values found for carbonates in other studies. We believe the high REE contents (at the 500 ppb level) in some detritusfree carbonates are due to REE-rich Fe-hydroxide in/on the carbonate. In favorable cases, such material may record seawater ϵ_(Nd) values, however introduction of extraneous REE may obscure the original isotopic composition of pure CaCO_ 3 because of its very low intrinsic primary REE abundance. Modern biogenic apatite is also shown to have very low REE content (< 150 ppb Nd) but appears to quickly scavenge REE from seawater. Inorganically precipitated apatite from phosphorites has high concentrations of seawater-derived REE. Young phosphorite apatite from the Atlantic and Pacific oceans has ϵ_(Nd) in the range of the seawater from these oceans. Older apatite samples of similar age from different localities bordering common oceans record similar values of ϵ_(Nd) (T). Sedimentary apatite has ϵ_(Sr) (T) values in good agreement with the curves for ^(87) Sr/^(86) Sr of seawater as a function of time. Individual conodonts from a single formation yield the same ϵ_(Sr) (T) and ϵ_(Nd) (T). Other workers have shown that sedimentary apatite preserves seawater REE patterns. These characteristics suggest that sedimentary apatite can be used to determine ϵ_(Nd) (T) in ancient seawater. The seawater values so inferred range between − 1. 7 and − 8. 9 over the last 700 my and lie in the range of modern seawater, showing no evidence for drastic changes. High values of seawater ϵ_(Nd) (T) in the Triassic and latest Precambrian may correlate with the breakup of large continental landmasses. The initial ϵ_(Nd) (T) =− 15. 0 of a 2 AE old phosphorite implies the presence of 1. 5 AE old continental crust at 2 AE ago. The approach outlined here can be used to constrain the age of the exposed crust as a function of time...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Cores {{taken from}} the ridge areas of the Gorda-Juan de Fuca plate have a {{sedimentation}} rate that is appropriate {{for the study of}} late Quaternary stratigraphy. An analysis of the clay and silt mineralogy of the cores using X-ray diffraction methods and by noting changes in the foraminiferan-radiolarian abundances in the cores were utilized in developing a stratigraphic sequence. The clay fractions of these sediments consists of chlorite, illite and smectite. Cores taken from bathymetric highs contain, on the average, less smectite than do the turbidites from the adjacent lowlands. The low smectite content suggests eolian enrichment of these sediments since dusts collected from the nearby continent also have low smectite concentrations. Changes in the relative abundances of radiolaria and foraminifera are used to put biostratigraphic constraints on the correlation of mineralogical datums. Two changes in the foraminiferan-radiolarian ratios, marked by sharp increases in the abundance of radiolaria, occurred at 12, 500 years B. P. and 83, 000 years B. P. as dated by carbon- 14 and sedimentation rate extrapolations, respectively. Such faunal changes serve as an independent check of correlations of the mineralogical datums. In the 2 to 20 micron, silt fraction, quartz, chlorite, mica and feldspar are the predominant minerals. Intervals in which the relative abundance of quartz changes can be dated by carbon-l 4 and sedimentation rates, and related to late Quaternary climatic events. The quartz-rich zones are synchronous with periods of high insolation, high stands of sea-level, and to a lesser degree with the catastrophic floods of the Columbia River. The correlation with high solar radiation reflects quartz enrichment of the sediment due to an increased eolian contribution. The coincident high sea level stands effectively decreased the sedimentation rate of quartz-poor <b>continental</b> <b>detritus</b> that otherwise dilutes the eolian component. The periodic floods of the Columbia River, caused by the failure of ice dams, swept quartz-rich loess from eastern Washington down the river and injected into the marine environment. Such sediment also increased the quartz abundance in the quartz-rich zones on the ridges. Thus, the late Quaternary stratigraphy of the cores can be related to global late Quaternary climatic variations as well as to events recorded on the adjacent continents. The structural development of the Gorda-Juan de Fuca plate over the last 10 million years can be explained by north-south shortening coupled with the normal tectonism associated with a spreading sea floor. This hypothesis {{for the development of the}} plate is based on the presently known magnetic anomaly pattern. A series of reconstructions of this pattern back through the past 10 million years shows that both the Gorda and Juan de Fuca portions of the plate have grown steadily smaller. The incorporation of sequentially shorter Gorda ridge anomalies into the Pacific plate appears to have led to the northwest-southeast orientation of the Blanco Fracture Zone, with consequent changes in the direction of spreading of the Juan de Fuca Ridge. On the Juan de Fuca portion of the plate, the shortening was accomplished by shear faulting in Cascadia Basin. Furthermore, this faulting resulted in the rapid subduction of this portion of the plate, which, in turn, produced a disconformity in the sediments of Cascadia Basin. The reconstruction strengthens the notion that right lateral strike slip motion between the Pacific and Gorda-Juan de Fuca plate does, indeed, exist...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} on the backarc mantle lithosphere in Patagonia has shown that it suffered a regional, pervasive, re-crystallisation and that the regions {{to the north and}} south of the latitude of the actual triple point (40 ° 30 ’) between the Antartctica, Nazca and South America plate present important differences in the regional distribution of metasomatic components. Subduction of the Chile ridge is believed to have induced an interruption in the subducting plate (slab window, D’ 0 razio et al. 2001, Gorring and Kay, 2001), upraise and melting of the sub-slab astenosphere, producing the abundant plateau and postplateu OIB like lavas, which record slab component only in the westernmost occurrences (Stern et al., 1990). The Cerro de los Chenques locality occurs immediately {{to the north of the}} latitude of the Triple point, it overlays the subducted Nazca plate and occurs at the edge of the putative slab window. It is, therefore, of especial importance for revealing the processes and constraining the metasomatic components of the mantle wedge in a complex geotectonic situation. Xenoliths occurring in alkaline lavas are predominately granular to porphyroblastic spinel-facies lherzolites, being harzburgites and dunites less abundant. They do not contain hydrous phases, but may contain trace amounts of glass derived from infiltration of the host basalt. They record equilibrium temperature in the range of 900 - 1100 °C. Bulk-rock and mineral phases exhibit major element variation trends apparently consistent with melting and melt removal processes. This is also the case for moderately incompatible elements (e. g. HREE) in bulk rock and clinopyroxene, but not for highly incompatible elements. In lherzolites, clinopyroxene varies from moderately LREE depleted (Cen/Ybn 0. 26 – 0. 91) to moderately LREE-enriched (Cen/Ybn up to 2. 6), being the REE pattern virtually flat in the range Eu – Lu at a 2 to 5 xPM concentration level. Harzburgitic clinopyroxene is LREE-enriched and the whole REE pattern varies from U-shaped to steadily fractionated (Cen/Ybn 14. 4) In dunite, cpx is slightly LREE enriched. All the pyroxenes are enriched in Th, U and La with respect to Nb and Ta and depleted in Ti and Pb with respect to Gd and Ce, respectively. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr value in clinopyroxene ranges 0. 70279 – 0. 70423 and 143 Nd/ 144 Nd 0. 51279 – 0. 51349. In the Sr-Nd isotope diagram, clinopyroxenes constitute a tight array (R 2 = 0. 79) between a highly depleted end-member and a component enriched in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr with respect to BE. The C. Chenques array runs at higher 87 Sr/ 86 Sr than the field of the Gobernador Gregores xenoliths and it is followed also by the xenoliths from P. Indios and E. Alvares (northern Patagonia) and Fraile and Cumbres (south of the volcanic gap). It is also on line at the enriched side with the isotope values of the C. Pampa, Lautaro and Aguilera adakites (those closest to the present occurrence). Isotope variations correlate with bulk-rock and cpx composition, so that the increase of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr correlates in cpx with an increase of the Mg# value and Sr, Zr, LREE, Pb, Th and U concentrations and with the decrease of Na, Fe, Ti, V, Y, Nb and HREE concentrations. Obviously the 143 Nd/ 144 Nd variation with respect to the geochemical parameters has the opposite behaviour of Sr. Assuming higher porosity in depleted peridotites, these data may indicate that a metasomatic agent affected a mantle that suffered previous variable depletion, being the amount of the metasomatic component proportional to the depletion. Alternatively, the variation trends may indicate melting triggered by the addition of a metasomatic agent and removal of the resulting hybrid melt. The increase of the highly incompatible element concentrations with increasing isotope fertility favours the first possibility. The trace element - isotope relationships reveal that the added component was enriched in LILE, LREE, Zr and depleted in Nb and Ti. These are characteristics expected in components derived from the subducting slab. The similarity of the potential melts estimated from clinopyroxene with the Patagonia arc magmas supports this conclusion. More detailed information on the composition of the subducted plate is provided by the correlations of isotopes with Th/La, Pb/U, Ce/Pb, Nb/U and Zr/Hf, showing that the metasomatic component was enriched in Pb with respect to U, in Ce with respect to Pb, in Th with respect to La, thus suggesting contribution of altered oceanic crust, pelagic sediments and, possibly, <b>continental</b> <b>detritus</b> components occurring in the trench. However, Klein and Karsten (1995) have documented the occurrence of Chile ridge basalts having arc-like geochemistry. Subduction of the Nazca plate related to one of these segments may control the composition of the metasomatic agent...|$|E
