5|$|The {{shipping}} line operations of Cunard didn't escape review by Smallpeice. He was already {{familiar with the}} <b>containerisation</b> of freight prior to taking up his position with Cunard, but spent time during 1966 to visit the Sea-Land Service container terminal at Port Newark and further familiarised himself {{with the use of}} containers in marine traffic. Container ships were considered too large for the traditional British {{shipping line}}s, including Cunard and their subsidiaries to operate, so it would be necessary to form partnerships.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Second World War had {{finished}} the Albert Dock's future looked bleak. The owners of the dock, the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board (MDHB) were in financial crisis and chose not to repair any of the wartime bomb damage, adopting an attitude of 'if it's not broke don't fix it, {{and if it is}} broke we still won't fix it'. At the same time a change in geo-political orientation towards Europe, coupled with the advent of <b>containerisation</b> meant the whole docking system in the city of Liverpool suffered as newer, stronger ports emerged elsewhere in the UK. Nonetheless the architectural and technological value of the docks was recognised in 1952 when the Albert Dock was granted Grade I listed building status.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1887; it took {{six years and}} cost £15million (equivalent to about £1.65billion in 2011). When the ship canal opened in January 1894 {{it was the largest}} river {{navigation}} canal in the world, and enabled the newly created Port of Manchester to become Britain's third busiest port despite the city being about 40 miles (64km) inland. Changes to shipping methods and the growth of <b>containerisation</b> during the 1970s and 80s meant that many ships were now too big to use the canal and traffic declined, resulting in the closure of the terminal docks at Salford. Although able to accommodate a range of vessels from coastal ships to inter-continental cargo liners, the canal is not large enough for most modern vessels. By 2011 traffic had decreased from its peak in 1958 of 18million long tons (20million short tons) of freight each year to about 7million long tons (7.8million short tons). The canal is now privately owned by Peel Ports, whose plans include redevelopment, expansion and an increase in shipping from 8,000 containers a year to 100,000 by 2030 as part of their Atlantic Gateway project.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>containerisation</b> in the 1960s {{had a major}} impact on the Port, changing cargo handling methods and significantly reducing the size of the local workforce.|$|E
25|$|The {{final phase}} of {{reclamation}} {{took place in the}} 1960s and 1970s. A government report in 1967 recommended the adoption of <b>containerisation</b> and that Wellington should be one of the two New Zealand ports. With <b>containerisation</b> came new roll-on/roll-off cargo handling methods that require more land adjacent to ships' berths. This resulted in the start of an extension to the Aotea Quay reclamation. Reclamation was carried out on both sides of Queens Wharf and the Wellington Harbour Board Container Terminal was created by a large reclamation at Thorndon.|$|E
25|$|The {{reclamation}} of Wellington Harbour {{started in}} the 1850s, originally {{to increase the amount}} of usable flat land for Wellington city. Reclamations in the 1960s and 1970s were to meet the needs of container shipping (<b>containerisation)</b> and new cargo handling methods. Reclamation has added more than 155 hectares to Wellington.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s Melbourne Yard was rearranged {{for greater}} efficiency, with a hump yard opened on 9 December 1970 {{to assist in}} the {{marshalling}} of wagons. Increased <b>containerisation</b> of freight traffic left the yard outdated, with the Dynon complex of terminals taking over the freight task, with the hump yard last used in September 1987.|$|E
25|$|The Second Malaysia Plan {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of <b>containerisation</b> in Malaysia to better facilitate transportation. The plan called {{for the establishment of}} a national haulage company to handle inland transport; in August 1971, Kontena Nasional Berhad (National Containers Limited) was established by the government. In December, M.V. Benavon became the first container vessel to dock in Malaysia, at the North Terminal of Port Klang in Selangor.|$|E
25|$|In 1969 British and Commonwealth Shipping, Furness Withy, P and The Ocean Steamship Company {{established}} Overseas Containers Limited ('OCL') {{to exploit}} <b>containerisation.</b> By the early 1980s it had converted {{all of its}} dry cargo liner routes to container operations and in 1986 it bought out the remaining OCL partners, renaming the operation P Containers Limited (P). P was merged with Nedlloyd in 1996 to form P Nedlloyd.|$|E
25|$|Container-sized {{units are}} also {{often used for}} moving large pieces of {{equipment}} to temporary sites. Specialised containers are particularly attractive to militaries already using <b>containerisation</b> to move much of their freight around. Shipment of specialized equipment in this way simplifies logistics and may prevent identification of high value equipment by enemies. Such systems may include command and control facilities, mobile operating theatres or even missile launchers (such as the Russian 3M-54 Klub surface-to-surface missile).|$|E
25|$|PERNAS was {{established}} to purchase businesses and participate in joint ventures with private companies, {{as well as to}} develop nascent industries to be held in trust until the Malays held sufficient capital to take them over. By the end of the plan's tenure, PERNAS owned 100% of eight companies involved in insurance, trading, construction, properties, engineering, securities, and mining. Joint ventures had also been formed with the private sector to develop the mining, <b>containerisation,</b> tourism and consulting industries.|$|E
25|$|From {{the mid-1970s}} onwards, Liverpool's docks and {{traditional}} manufacturing industries declined due to restructuring of shipping and heavy industry, causing massive losses of jobs. The advent of <b>containerisation</b> {{meant that the}} city's docks became largely obsolete, and dock workers were thrown out of jobs. By the early 1980s unemployment rates in Liverpool were {{among the highest in}} the UK, standing at 17% by January 1982. This was about half the level of unemployment that had affected the city during the Great Depression 50 years previously.|$|E
25|$|Tranz Rail {{was accused}} of forcing freight onto the roads, and in 2002 {{introduced}} a <b>containerisation</b> scheme that assumed that most freight would be carried in containers on unit trains made up of fixed consists of flat deck wagons. Container loading depots were constructed at the major freight terminals. One of the reasons often cited for these policies was {{that the cost of}} using road transport to Tranz Rail was less than that of using rail, because the road infrastructure is provided as a public good, whereas the rail network was a private good.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, <b>containerisation</b> revolutionised shipping, {{eventually}} {{coming to}} New Zealand as well. The local harbour boards wrought massive changes on those ports selected (after much political wrangling) {{to handle the}} new giant vessels, such as Lyttelton and Auckland Port. Gantry cranes, straddle carriers and powerful tugboats were built or purchased, and shipping channels dredged deeper, while large areas of land were reclaimed to enable the new container terminals. The changes {{have been described as}} having been more radical than the changeover from sail to steam a century before.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>containerisation</b> {{made many}} of the smaller ports suffer, this being only later {{recovered}} somewhat with newer, smaller multi-purpose ships that could travel to smaller ports, and the loosening of the trade links with the United Kingdom, which diversified the trade routes. The time for river ports had gone however, {{and most of them}} disappeared, facing particular pressure from the new rail ferries, In the 1980s, deregulation also involved and heavily changed the port industry, with harbour boards abolished, and replaced by more commercially focused companies. Many port jobs were lost, though shipping costs fell.|$|E
25|$|The Apple Express narrow-gauge {{tourist train}} to Avontuur {{operated}} from the separate station in Humewood Road near King's Beach. It departed regularly for Thornhill Village via Van Stadens River bridge, the highest narrow-gauge rail {{bridge in the}} world. The Apple Express was launched to provide a service to transport fresh produce and wood from the farms along the line to Avontuur. The line was completed in 1914 and the train delivered produce directly from the farms to ships in the Port Elizabeth Harbour. Due to modern transport methods such as <b>containerisation,</b> and refrigerated containers and trucks, the Apple Express and its services became redundant. Service has now ceased.|$|E
25|$|Grimsby is {{strongly}} {{linked with the}} sea fishing industry, which once generated wealth for the town. At its peak in the 1950s, {{it was the largest}} and busiest fishing port in the world. As a result of the Cod Wars with Iceland, this industry has been in decline for many years. In 1970 around 400 trawlers were based in the port, by 2013 only 5 trawlers remain based there. By comparison, 15 vessels are used to maintain offshore wind farms in the North Sea. The town still has the largest fish market in the UK, but most of what is sold is now brought overland from other ports or Iceland via <b>containerisation.</b> Of the 18,000 tonnes of fresh fish sold in Grimsby fish market in 2012, almost 13,000 tonnes, mainly cod and haddock, came from Iceland.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1960s, {{there was}} little focus on long-distance freight between the major centres. Instead, the Main South Line was used to feed its many branch lines, with the {{majority}} of goods trains being local services between regional areas and major centres or harbours in Christchurch (Lyttelton), Timaru, Oamaru, Dunedin (Port Chalmers), and Invercargill (Bluff). A good example of how regionalised this traffic was comes from the Dunedin-Invercargill portion of the line. North of Clinton were five branches whose traffic essentially ran to and from Dunedin/Port Chalmers, while south of Clinton were four branches whose traffic essentially ran to or from Invercargill/Bluff. As this short-distance local traffic declined in the 1950s and 1960s and branch lines closed, long-distance freight increased, with through services between the major centres rising to prominence. The concentration of exports on fewer ports and the development of <b>containerisation</b> spurred on long-distance freight, and the first freight train from Christchurch to Invercargill was introduced in December 1970 on a 16-hour schedule.|$|E
25|$|Arjun Mark II has a {{total of}} 93 upgrades, {{including}} 13 major improvements. The major upgrades are missile-firing capability against long-range targets, panoramic sight with night vision to engage targets effectively at night, <b>containerisation</b> of the ammunition, enhanced main weapon penetration; additional ammunition types, explosive reactive armour, an advanced air-defence gun to engage helicopters; a mine plough, an advanced land navigation system and a warning system which can fire smoke grenades to confuse laser guidance. Other upgrades are an enhanced Auxiliary power unit providing 8.5 KW (from 4.5 KW) and an improved gun barrel, changes in the commander's panoramic sight with eye safe LRF, night vision capability including for driver, digital control harness, new final drive, track and sprocket. The Arjun Mk.2 has an advanced hydropneumatic suspension system which provides very good comfort to the crew, This tank is also fitted with auxiliary power unit which powers all systems when the main engine is turned off and It can be also fitted with a mine plough.|$|E
25|$|Ferries used to link {{opposite}} sides of the Clyde in Glasgow but they have been rendered near-obsolete, by bridges and tunnels including the Erskine Bridge, Kingston Bridge, and the Clyde Tunnel. The only remaining crossings are the Renfrew Ferry between Renfrew and Yoker, and the Kilcreggan Ferry in Inverclyde, both run by SPT but outwith the city boundary. The PS Waverley, the world's last operational seagoing paddle-steamer, provides services from Glasgow city Centre, mainly catering to the pleasure cruise market. A regular waterbus service links the city Centre with Braehead in Renfrewshire, some 30 minutes downstream. A service by Loch Lomond Seaplanes, connecting the city with destinations in Argyll and Bute started in 2007. The only operational dock left in Glasgow operated by Clydeport is the King George V Dock, near Braehead. Since the advent of <b>Containerisation,</b> most other facilities, such as Hunterston Terminal are located in the deep waters of the Firth of Clyde, which together handle some 7.5million tonnes of cargo each year. Longer distant commercial sea shipping from Glasgow occurs regularly to many European destinations including Mediterranean and Baltic ports via passage through the Sea of the Hebrides.|$|E
500|$|The {{design of}} the Skylon D1 {{features}} a large cylindrical payload bay, [...] long and [...] in diameter. It {{is designed to be}} comparable with current payload dimensions, and able to support the <b>containerisation</b> of payloads that Reaction Engines envisions being produced in the future. To an equatorial orbit, Skylon could deliver [...] to a [...] altitude or [...] to an [...] altitude. Using interchangeable payload containers, Skylon could be fitted to carry satellites or fluid cargo into orbit, or, in a specialised habitation module, the latter being capable of housing a maximum of 30 astronauts during a single launch.

500|$|He {{moved to}} Cunard as a {{director}} and then chairman, where {{he was responsible for}} radically altering the passenger and freight operations of the business; on the passenger side of the business, he cut massive losses by selling the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth liners, then oversaw the radical re-design of the replacement liner the Queen Elizabeth 2, which was under construction when he took up his position with Cunard. The changes he oversaw allowed the Queen Elizabeth 2 to become a profitable luxury liner for the company. His work on the freight size of the business included the <b>containerisation</b> of the business together with the amalgamation of smaller lines and the formation of joint ventures which would be needed to operate larger container ships. He was chairman of Cunard when the Atlantic Conveyor was ordered and launched as part of Cunard's contribution to the Atlantic Container Line joint-venture.|$|E
500|$|The {{standard}} ocean-going {{cargo ship}} was the Liberty ship. They were not ideal for logistical purposes. With a maximum speed of , they were slow, {{but this was}} considered less important than their ability to be turned out cheaply and in large numbers. They were deliberately built small, which reduced the loss when one was sunk, but limited the cargo capacity to [...] Critically, their draft was [...] when fully laden. They had five small holds, {{each with its own}} hatch. Their curved sides made them wider at the top than the bottom, and wider amidships than fore and aft. <b>Containerisation</b> of shipping did not begin until a decade after war, so most wartime military shipments were break bulk cargo, with goods in bags, boxes, crates, barrels and drums. This was very efficient in terms of shipping space, but loading and unloading was consequently slow and manpower intensive. It also meant that ships could be unloaded with their own tackle, without special port facilities. Loading a ship was something of an art form. The ideal was to make best use of irregular spaces. Goods had to be stowed so as to wedge everything together tightly, as items that shifted at sea could break open and cause damage to their contents and other items. A load that shifted could even cause the ship to capsize.|$|E
500|$|The first railway ('The Commercial Railway') to be built, in 1840, was a {{passenger}} service based on cable haulage by stationary steam engines {{that ran the}} [...] from Minories to Blackwall {{on a pair of}} tracks. It required [...] of hemp rope, and 'dropped' carriages as it arrived at stations, which were reattached to the cable for the return journey, and the train 'reassembling' itself at the terminus. The line was converted to standard gauge in 1859, and steam locomotives adopted. The building of London termini at Fenchurch Street (1841), and Bishopsgate (1840) provided access to new suburbs across the River Lea, again resulting in the destruction of housing and increased overcrowding in the slums. [...] After the opening of Liverpool Street station (1874), Bishopsgate railway station became a goods yard, in 1881, to bring imports from Eastern ports. With the introduction of <b>containerisation,</b> the station declined, suffered a fire in 1964 that destroyed the station buildings, and it was finally demolished in 2004 for the extension of the East London Line. In the 19th century, the area north of Bow Road became a major railway centre for the North London Railway, with marshalling yards and a maintenance depot serving both the City and the West India docks. Nearby Bow railway station opened in 1850 and was rebuilt in 1870 in a grand style, featuring a concert hall. The line and yards closed in 1944, after severe bomb damage, and never reopened, as goods became less significant, and cheaper facilities were concentrated in Essex.|$|E
2500|$|After the war, {{the docks}} {{underwent}} a brief resurgence and were even upgraded in 1967. However, {{with the advent}} of <b>containerisation,</b> which the docks could not handle, they became obsolete soon afterwards. The docks closed progressively during the 1970s, with the last [...] the West India and Millwall docks [...] closing down in 1980. This left the area in a severely dilapidated state, with large areas being derelict and abandoned.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first report}} {{identified}} 2,363 stations and [...] of railway line for closure, 55% of stations and 30% of route miles, with an objective of stemming the large losses being incurred {{during a period}} of increasing competition from road transport and reducing the rail subsidies necessary to keep the network running; the second identified a small number of major routes for significant investment. The 1963 report also recommended some less well publicised changes, including a switch to <b>containerisation</b> for rail freight.|$|E
2500|$|Up to the 1950s, much of {{the freight}} traffic in Canterbury {{involved}} services between rural areas and the major centres and ports. [...] Manufactured imports were distributed mainly from Christchurch and Dunedin, with agricultural produce exported from Port Chalmers, Oamaru, Timaru and Lyttelton. [...] The South Island Main Trunk connected the major centres to the branch lines rather than handling long-haul traffic. [...] Since the 1950s, with {{the decline in the}} branch line network, the role of the South Island Main Trunk has changed with it now handling predominantly long-haul freight, a change brought about in part by the <b>containerisation</b> of freight handling and the inter-island ferries.|$|E
2500|$|The {{assumption}} at {{the time}} was that car owners would drive to the nearest railhead (which was usually the junction where the closed branch line would otherwise have taken them) and continue their journey onwards by train. In practice, having left home in their cars, people used them for the whole journey. Similarly for freight: without branch lines, the railways' ability to transport goods [...] "door to door" [...] was dramatically reduced. As in the passenger model, it was assumed that lorries would pick up goods and transport them to the nearest railhead, where they would be taken across the country by train, unloaded onto another lorry and taken to their destination. The development of the motorway network, the advent of <b>containerisation,</b> improvements in lorries and the economic costs of having two break-bulk points combined to make long-distance road transport a more viable alternative.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1956, railcars {{replaced}} the Opua Express. [...] Unfortunately for Opua, the railcars operated {{to the other}} northern terminus of Okaihau on the Okaihau Branch, leaving Opua without any dedicated passenger trains. [...] Passengers {{had to rely on}} mixed trains, which did not connect with the railcars. [...] Nonetheless, the mixed trains lasted another two decades (longer than the railcars, which ceased operating in 1967); the last one ran between Whangarei and Opua on 18 June 1976. [...] From this time, this part was used to carry solely freight, almost all of which was output from the Moerewa Dairy Factory and Affco Meat Works to the port of Opua. [...] By the 1980s, regular freight services beyond Kawakawa were becoming irregular due to the decline of shipping to Opua as a result of <b>containerisation.</b> [...] It was last used in 1985 and leased to the Bay of Islands Vintage Railway to operate tourist passenger services from Opua to Kawakawa, including running down the centre of Kawakawa's main street.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1970s, <b>containerisation</b> {{started in}} India {{in a limited}} way with the {{creation}} of interim container handling facilities at Mumbai and Cochin ports in 1973. During the same period, Chennai Port began handling containerised cargoes. In 1983, a container terminal was built at the Bharathi Dock with a [...] quay, a [...] container yard, and a [...] container freight station, which was commissioned by the then prime minister Indira Gandhi on 18 December 1983 as the country's first dedicated container terminal facility. The terminal was provided with tow-shore cranes and other shore facilities. In 1991, the port's container terminal quay was lengthened by [...] with two additional tow shore cranes. In November 2001, the container terminal and back-up area was privatised through a 30-year concession with Chennai Container Terminal Private Limited. Continually increasing container traffic resulted in another [...] extension of the quay in 2002, bringing the total berth length to [...] During 2008–09, the port recorded a 17.2% share of container traffic in India. Having the capability of handling fourth-generation vessels, the terminal is ranked among the top 100 container ports in the world. To meet the demand in container handling, the port is added with the second container terminal with a capacity to handle 1.5 million TEUs. The port is also planning a mega container terminal, capable of handling 4 million TEUs per annum expected to be operational from 2013, when {{the first phase of the}} project will be completed. The full project will be completed by 2017.|$|E
