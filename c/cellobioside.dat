40|$|Winter cress (Barbarea vulgaris) is {{resistant}} {{to a range}} of insect species. Some B. vulgaris genotypes are resistant, whereas others are susceptible, to herbivory by flea beetle larvae (Phyllotreta nemorum). Metabolites involved in resistance to herbivory by flea beetles were identified using an ecometabolomic approach. An F 2 population representing the whole range from full susceptibility to full resistance to flea beetle larvae was generated by a cross between a susceptible and a resistant B. vulgaris plant. This F 2 offspring was evaluated with a bioassay measuring the ability of susceptible flea beetle larvae to survive on each plant. Metabolites that correlated negatively with larvae survival were identified through correlation, cluster, and principal component analyses. Two main clusters of metabolites that correlate negatively with larvae survival were identified. Principal component analysis grouped resistant and susceptible plants as well as correlated metabolites. Known saponins, such as hederagenin <b>cellobioside</b> and oleanolic acid <b>cellobioside,</b> as well as two other saponins correlated significantly with plant resistance. This study shows the potential of metabolomics to identify bioactive compounds involved in plant defense...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{the number}} of studies {{investigating}} triterpenoid saponins has drastically increased due to their diverse and potentially attractive biological activities. Currently the literature contains chemical structures of few hundreds of triterpenoid saponins {{of plant and animal}} origin. Triterpenoid saponins consist of a triterpene aglycone with one or more sugar moieties attached to it. However, due to similar physico-chemical properties, isolation and identification of a large diversity of triterpenoid saponins remain challenging. This study demonstrates a methodology to screen saponins using hyphenated analytical platforms, GC-MS, LC-MS/MS, and LC-SPE-NMR/MS, in the example of two different phenotypes of the model plant Barbarea vulgaris (winter cress), glabrous (G) and pubescent (P) type that are known to differ by their insect resistance. The proposed methodology allows for detailed comparison of saponin profiles from intact plant extracts as well as saponin aglycone profiles from hydrolysed samples. Continuously measured 1 D proton NMR data during LC separation along with mass spectrometry data revealed significant differences, including contents of saponins, types of aglycones and numbers of sugar moieties attached to the aglycone. A total of 49 peaks were tentatively identified as saponins from both plants; they are derived from eight types of aglycones and with 2 – 5 sugar moieties. Identification of two previously known insect-deterrent saponins, hederagenin <b>cellobioside</b> and oleanolic acid <b>cellobioside,</b> demonstrated the applicability of the methodology for relatively rapid screening of bioactive compounds...|$|E

The enzyme exhibited low hydrolytic activity on acid-swollen cellulose and practically no activity on carboxymethyl cellulose, Avicel cellulose, and cellobiose, but it hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl lactoside and released cellobiose from cellotriose and from higher cello-oligosaccharides.

40|$|Although {{numerous}} biologically active molecules {{exist as}} glycosides in nature, {{information on the}} activity, stability, and solubility of glycosylated antioxidants is rather limited to date. In this work, {{a wide variety of}} antioxidants were glycosylated using different phosphorylase enzymes.

Glycosylation was found to significantly increase the solubility and stability of all evaluated compounds. Despite decreased radical-scavenging abilities, most glycosides were identified to be potent antioxidants, outperforming the commonly used 2, 6 -bis(1, 1 -dimethylethyl) - 4 -methylphenol (BHT).

40|$|The crystal {{structures}} of Family 7 glycohydrolases {{suggest that a}} histidine residue near the acid/base catalyst {{could account for the}} higher pH optimum of the Humicola insolens endoglucanase Cel 7 B, than the corresponding Trichoderma reesei enzymes. Modelling studies indicated that introduction of histidine at the homologous position in T. reesei Cel 7 A (Ala 224) required additional changes to accommodate the bulkier histidine side chain. X-ray crystallography of the catalytic domain of the E 223 S/A 224 H/L 225 V/T 226 A/D 262 G mutant reveals that major differences from the wild-type are confined to the mutations themselves. The introduced histidine residue is in plane with its counterpart in H. insolens Cel 7 B, but is 1. 0 Å (= 0. 1 nm) closer to the acid/base Glu 217 residue, with a 3. 1 Å contact between Ne 2 and Oe 1. The pH variation of kcat/Km for 3, 4 -dinitrophenyl lactoside hydrolysis was accurately bell-shaped for both wild-type and mutant, with pK 1 shifting from 2. 22 ± 0. 03 in the wild-type to 3. 19 ± 0. 03 in the mutant, and pK 2 shifting from 5. 99 ± 0. 02 to 6. 78 ± 0. 02. With this poor substrate, the ionizations probably represent those of the free enzyme. The relative kcat for 2 -chloro- 4 -nitrophenyl lactoside showed similar behaviour. The shift in the mutant pH optimum was associated with lower kcat/Km values for both lactosides and <b>cellobiosides,</b> and a marginally lower stability. However, kcat values for <b>cellobiosides</b> are higher for the mutant. This we attribute to reduced non-productive binding in the + 1 and + 2 subsites; inhibition by cellobiose is certainly relieved in the mutant. The weaker binding of cellobiose is due to the loss of two water-mediated hydrogen bonds...|$|R
40|$|The enzymatic {{degradation}} of cellulose {{is an important}} process in nature. This thesis {{has focused on the}} degradation of cellulose by enzymes from two cellulose-degrading fungi, Hypocrea jecorina and Phanerochaete chrysosporium, including both the action of the individual enzymes and their synergistic interplay. The end-preference of cellobiohydrolases on crystalline cellulose was studied. Cellobiohydrolases belonging to glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family 7 were found to hydrolyse cellulose processively, starting from the reducing end of the cellulose chain. End-labelled cellulose can serve as a tool for functional classification of cellulases. The synergy mechanism between endoglucanases and cellobiohydrolases was studied using substrates with different physical properties derived from bacterial cellulose. A new mechanism for synergism between endo- and exoacting enzymes was proposed whereby endoglucanases, in addition to creating nicks in amorphous parts of cellulose, thereby making new starting-points for processively acting cellobiohydrolases, also “polish” the cellulose surface by removing shorter chains from cellulose surface. A new small endoglucanase belonging to the GH 12 family was isolated and characterised. The proposed role of this enzyme is to make the cellulose in wood more accessible to other cellulases. Oxygen conversion by cellobiose dehydrogenase was studied. Hydrogen peroxide produced by cellobiose dehydrogenase can be decomposed even by traces of certain metal ions into a hydroxyl radical and a hydroxyl ion. As an example, reduced metal ions will be continuously regenerated by cellobiose dehydrogenase, which thus stimulates the degradation. Interactions between GH 7 family cellobiohydrolases and o-nitrophenyl <b>cellobioside</b> were studied by fluorescence spectroscopy and kinetic tests. o-nitrophenyl <b>cellobioside</b> was used as indicator ligand to determine the dissociation constants for cellobiose binding to catalytically inactive Cel 7 A mutants by displacement binding experiments...|$|E
40|$|The {{cellulase}} {{mixture of}} Hypocrea jecorina (formerly Trichoderma reesei) contains {{a variety of}} exo- and endoglucanases that belong to different structural families. As such, these enzymes form an interesting model system to study the enzyme-ligand interactions in glycoside hydrolases. The nucleophilic carboxylate of retaining -glycosidases is believed to form a hydrogen bond with the 2 -hydroxyl group of their substrate. Consequently, replacing this hydroxyl group with an amino group should result in a stronger electrostatic interaction and thus an increased affinity for the ligand. In this study, several modified cellobiosides were synthesized and evaluated as cellulase inhibitors. The introduction of an amino group {{was found to have}} an unpredictable effect on the inhibitory power of the ligands. However, the enzymes display a very high affinity for the corresponding 2 -azido compounds, precursors in the synthetic route.

40|$|A {{glucoside}} and <b>cellobioside</b> of glycolamide were synthesised and {{the crystal}} chemistry of these compounds investigated. The amidoglucoside crystallised in the P 2 (1) space group. The primary amide group participates in C(7) and C(17) chains also involving the pyranose oxygen and hydroxyl groups. The amidocellobioside crystallised as a methanol solvate in the P 2 (1) space group. The amide N-H groups donate hydrogen bonds to oxygen atoms on the cellobiose units, while intramolecular hydrogen bonds {{give rise to}} S(7) and S(9) motifs {{in addition to a}} R- 3 (3) (9) motif. A tetra-O-acetylglucoside derivative of thioglycolamide and its sulfoxide derivative were synthesised to examine the effect of protecting the glucopyranose hydroxyl groups. The thioglycolamido derivative, which crystallised in the P 2 (1) 2 (1) 2 (1) space group, featured amide N-H groups donating to the glucopyranose oxygen and an acetyloxy group.

The fusion protein was used to raise a CEL 1 -specific antibody. CEL 1 was detected as an extracellular 49. 8 kDa protein in A. bisporus cellulose-grown cultures, where it bound strongly to cellulose. CEL 1 was neither an endoglucanase, a cellobiohydrolase able to hydrolyze fluorogenic <b>cellobiosides,</b> a beta-glucosidase, a xylanase, nor a cellobiose: quinone oxidoreductase.

40|$|Values of kcat. and Km for the {{hydrolysis}} of cellotetraose, cellotriose, beta-cellobiosyl fluoride {{and various}} beta-aryl <b>cellobiosides</b> by endoglucanase A (CenA) from Cellulomonas fimi indicate that specific binding {{interactions between the}} reducing-end glucose residues of cellotetraose and cellotriose and the enzyme at the transition state provide enormous stabilization, endowing glucose with the "effective leaving group ability' of 2, 4 -dinitrophenol. As has been seen with several other inverting glycosidases, CenA hydrolyses the "wrong' anomer of its glycosyl fluoride substrate, alpha-cellobiosyl fluoride, according to non-Michaelian kinetics. This indicates that CenA carries out this hydrolysis by a mechanism involving binding of two substrate molecules in the active site (Hehre, Brewer and Genghof (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 5942 - 5950] in contrast with that reported for cellobiohydrolase II, another family- 6 enzyme [Konstantinidis, Marsden and Sinnott (1993) Biochem. J. 291, 833 - 838]. The pH profiles for wild-type CenA indicate that kcat. for CenA depends {{on the presence of}} both a protonated group and a deprotonated group for full activity, consistent with the presence of an acid and a base catalyst at the active site. By contrast, the profile for the Asp 252 Ala mutant of CenA shows a dependence only on a base-catalytic group, thereby confirming the role of Asp- 252 as an acid catalyst. These results show that hydrolysis by CenA occurs by a typical inverting mechanism involving both acid and base catalysis, as first proposed by Koshland. It also suggests that endoglucanases from family 6 may function by fundamentally different mechanisms for exoglucanases in this family...|$|R

CelD releases a fluorescent 4 -methylumbelliferyl product from 4 -methylumbelliferyl <b>cellobioside.</b> This hydrolysis activity was used to quantify the amount of DBP–CelD bound to an immobilised biotin-labelled target sequence. The DNA-binding assay can be performed in a 96 -well plate format for high- throughput analysis of putative DBPs. This method was applied to analysis of the binding properties and sequence selectivity of a cold-inducible transcription factor HvCBF 1 from barley containing an AP 2 DNA-binding domain. A base-scanning approach using degenerate oligonucleotide probes was employed for rapid identification of the conserved core motif of the HvCBF 1 binding site. Quantitative analysis of the binding site of HvCBF 1 using systematic base substitution revealed that a (G/a) (C/t) CGAC sequence was sufficient to constitute a functional motif, where the lower-case letters represent less efficient bases. The method enables us to provide accurate and quantitative data on a comprehensive DNA-binding profile for a cold-inducible AP 2 transcription factor {{as well as information}} on environmental parameters potentially influencing the DNA-binding activity.

40|$|Insertional {{mutagenesis}} {{was applied}} {{for the first time}} to a fungal biocontrol agent, Pseudozyma flocculosa, in an attempt to obtain mutants with altered antagonistic properties. Transformants were obtained via DNA-mediated transformation. Molecular analyses of the transformants revealed that multiple copies of the plasmid were integrated in tandem at one to many chromosomal loci. The transformants were screened for their biocontrol properties using standard bioassays, and the 160 tested transformants were classified into four groups: group I mutants (22 transformants) showed a stronger antagonistic effect than the wild type (WT) while those of group II (107 transformants) had a comparable antagonistic effect; group III mutants (17 transformants) had a decreased antagonistic effect relative to WT and group IV mutants (14 transformants) had lost their biocontrol properties. Culture extracts of the mutants (group IV) and WT were analyzed and compared for the presence of active metabolites which were then separated by solid-phase extraction and purified using conventional methods. Nuclear magnetic resonance experiments and analytical studies on a metabolite specifically produced by the WT revealed the presence of 2 -(2 ′, 4 ′-diacetoxy- 5 ′-carboxy-pentanoyl) octadecyl <b>cellobioside</b> (flocculosin), a novel glycolipid with strong antifungal properties; the production of this compound would account for the biocontrol activity of P. flocculosa...|$|E
40|$|One {{important}} feature of hydrolysis of cellulose by cellulases is that the reaction slows down quickly after it starts. In this work, we investigate the slowdown mechanism at the early stage of the reaction using endoglucanase Tr. Cel 5 A-catalyzed phosphate acid-swollen cellulose (PASC) hydrolysis as a model system. Specifically, {{we focus on the}} effect of enzyme adsorption on the reaction slowdown. Nineteen single mutations are introduced (with the assistance of molecular dynamics simulations) to perturb the enzyme PASC interaction, yielding the adsorption partitioning coefficient Kr that ranged from 0. 12 to 0. 39 L/g, compared to that of the wild type (0. 26 L/g). Several residues, including T 18, K 26, Y 26, H 229, and T 300, are demonstrated to be important for adsorption of the enzyme to PASC. The kinetic measurements show that the slowdown of the hydrolysis is not correlated with the adsorption quantified by the partitioning coefficient Kr but is anticorrelated with the initial activity. This result suggests that the mutants with higher activity are more prone to being trapped or deplete the most reactive substrate faster and the adsorption plays no apparent role in the reaction slowdown. The initial activity of Cel 5 A against PASC is correlated with the enzyme specific activity against a soluble substrate p-nitrophenyl <b>cellobioside...</b>|$|E
40|$|Cellulose I, {{mainly as}} ramie or as Avicel {{microcrystalline}} cellulose, has been monitored by optical microscopy and by C- 13 CPMAS NMR, {{over the course}} of its dissolution in hot N-methylmorpholine N-oxide solvent. Its interaction with the near-solvent N-ethylmorpholine N-oxide and related non-solvents has also been investigated. NMR shows that N-methylmorpholine N-oxide partly converts crystalline cellulose I into amorphous solid cellulose. The changes in chemical shift imply increased flexibility at the glycosidic bonds. In contrast, N-ethylmorpholine N-oxide converts cellulose I to cellulose IIII, without dissolution. Microscopy shows that the ramie fibres swell laterally, and at least some also shorten longitudinally, during dissolution. Model studies using methyl-beta-d-glucopyranose show no evidence from C- 13 chemical shifts for different modes of binding with different solvents. However, N-methylmorpholine N-oxide binds more strongly to methyl-beta-d-glucopyranose in DMSO than does N-ethylmorpholine N-oxide, whereas N-ethylmorpholine N-oxide binds better to H 2 O. Also, C- 13 T- 1 values for aqueous <b>cellobioside</b> show increasing rotational freedom of the -CH 2 OH sidechains as N-methylmorpholine N-oxide is added. Together, these observations imply the initial penetration of solvents and near-solvents between the molecular cellulose sheets. Subsequently, N-methylmorpholine N-oxide breaks H-bonds, particularly to O- 6, just sufficiently to loosen individual chains and then dissolve the sheets...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} of the cellulolytic activities found in three commercial Trichoderma reesei preparations is presented. Classical substrates such as native or processed cellulose and substituted (soluble) derivatives (e. g. carboxymethylcellulose) are poorly defined. Chromogenic (fluorogenic) 4 -methylumbelliferyl beta-glycosides can advantageously be applied to provide clear differentiation of the three main cellulolytic components of the complex from Trichoderma reesei, after separation by isoelectric focusing. Cellobiohydrolase I (CBH I) releases the fluorescent phenol from the lactoside (MULAC) and from the <b>cellobioside</b> (MUC). Endoglucanase I (EG I) liberates the phenol from the same substrates but the enzymes can be differentiated by specific inhibition with cellobiose (suppressing selectively the cellobiohydrolase activity). Endoglucanases III (EG III) is the only enzyme present in the complex capable of catalysing the hydrolysis of the cellotrioside (MUG) 3 at the heterosidic bond, yielding the fluorescent 4 -methylumbelliferone. The corresponding 2 -chloro- 4 -nitrophenol glycosides offer an attractive alternative to classical reductometric methods. The substrates are sufficiently stable (pH 4 - 8; 60 -degrees-C) and the favourable absorption characteristics of the phenol (pK 5. 5, absorption coefficient at 405 nm 8750 M- 1 cm- 1, pH 5. 6) allow sensitive, continuous and quantitative assays. Using these methods, {{it was found that}} Novo (Denmark) cellulase is particularly poor in beta-glucosidase activity, an IFP (France) preparation is maximally active on the classical substrates in contrast to the Genencor (USA) cellulase with high activity against the small, chromophoric substrates...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrolysis}} kinetics {{of bacterial}} cellulose and its derivatives by Trichoderma reesei cellulases was studied. The cellulose surface erosion model {{was introduced to}} explain the gradual and strong retardation of the rate of enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose. This model identifies the decrease in apparent processivity of cellobiohydrolases during the hydrolysis as {{a major contributor to}} the decreased rates. Both enzyme-related (non-productive binding) and substrate-related (erosion of cellulose surface) processes contribute to the decrease in apparent processivity. Furthermore, the surface erosion model allows, in addition to conventional endo-exo synergism, the possibility for different modes of synergistic action between cellulases. The second mode of synergism operates in parallel with the conventional one and was found to be predominant in the hydrolysis of more crystalline celluloses and also in the synergistic action of two cellobiohydrolases. A mechanism of substrate inhibition in synergistic hydrolysis of bacterial cellulose was proposed whereby the inhibition is a result of surface dilution of reaction components (bound cellobiohydrolase and cellulose chain ends) at lower enzyme-to-substrate ratios. The inhibition of cellulases by the hydrolysis product, cellobiose, was found to be strongly dependent {{on the nature of the}} substrate. The hydrolysis of a low molecular weight model substrate, such as para-nitrophenyl <b>cellobioside,</b> by cellobiohydrolase I is strongly inhibited by cellobiose with a competitive inhibition constant around 20 μM, whereas the hydrolysis of cellulose is more resistant to inhibition with an apparent inhibition constant around 1. 5 mM for cellobiose...|$|E

Significant differences were observed in the preferred site of cleavage even when substrates with {{the same number of}} glycosidic bonds were compared. Thus, although endoglucanase I was unable to attack normal cello-oligosaccharides shorter than degree of polymerization 6, it hydrolysed reduced cellopentaose to yield cellotriose and cellobi-itol, and it produced cellotriose and 4 -methylumbelliferyl glucoside from 4 -methylumbelliferyl cellotetraoside. Endoglucanase IV hydrolysed [1 - 3 H]cellotriose but did not attack either cellotri-itol or 4 -methylumbelliferyl <b>cellobioside.</b> These and other anomalous results indicated clearly that modification of the reducing glycosyl residue on the cello-oligosaccharides induces in an apparent change in the mode of action of the endoglucanases. It is suggested that, although cello-oligosaccharide derivatives are useful for differentiating and classifying endoglucanases, conclusions on the mechanism of cellulase action resulting from these measurements should be treated cautiously. Unequivocal information on the mode of endoglucanase action on cello-oligosaccharides was obtained with radiolabelled cello-oligosaccharides of degree of polymerization 3 to 5. Indications that transglycosylation was a property of the endoglucanases were particularly evident with the 4 -methylumbelliferyl cello-oligosaccharides. Turnover numbers for hydrolysis of the umbelliferyl cello-oligosaccharides were calculated, and these, along with the other analytical data collected on the products of hydrolysis of the normal, reduced and radiolabelled cello-oligosaccharides, suggested that the various endoglucanases had different roles to play in the overall hydrolysis of cellulose to sugars small enough to be transported through the cell membrane...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{synthesis}} and solid state analysis of carbohydrate derivatives, including many novel compounds. Although the synthetic chemistry surrounding carbohydrates is well established in the literature, the crystal chemistry of carbohydrates is less well studied. Therefore this research aims to improve understanding of the solid state properties of carbohydrate derivatives through gaining more information on their supramolecular bonding. Chapter One focuses on an introduction to the solid state of organic compounds, with a background to crystallisation, including issues that can arise during crystal growth. Chapter Two is based on glucopyranuronate derivatives which are understudied in terms of their solid state forms. This chapter reports on the formation of novel glucuronamides and utilising the functionality of the amide bond for crystallisation. TEMPO oxidation was completed to form glucopyranuronates by oxidation of the primary alcohol groups of glucosides to the carboxylic acid derivatives, to increase functionality for enhanced crystal growth. Chapter Three reports on the synthesis of glucopyranoside derivatives by O-glycosylation reactions and displays crystal structures, including a number of previously unsolved acetate protected and deprotected crystal structures. More complex glycoside derivatives were also researched in an aim to study the resultant supramolecular motifs. Chapter Four contains the synthesis of aryl <b>cellobioside</b> derivatives including the novel crystal structures that were solved for the acetate protected and deprotected compounds.

G 3 was not cleaved at all. G 2 was the main product of Avicel hydrolysis. Xylotetraose (X 4) and xylobiose (X 2) were mainly produced by the enzyme hydrolysis of xylan. G 2 inhibited the activity of carboxymethyl cellulase and Avicelase, whereas Mg 2 + stimulated it. The enzyme was completely inactivated by Hg 2 +, and it was inhibited by a thiol-blocking reagent. Hydrolysis of CMC took place, with a rapid decrease in viscosity but a slow liberation of reducing sugars.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains several {{enzyme kinetics}} studies, each demonstrating {{the importance of}} dimensional analysis in justifying rate expressions and the usefulness of perturbation techniques in generating approximate time-dependent solutions. Our {{focus has been on}} the action of cellulases, enzymes which hydrolyze the glycosidic bonds of cellulose, releasing sugars which can be used as feedstock for renewable commodities and fuels. The process involves two fundamental steps at the solid-liquid phase boundary: enzyme binding and hydrolysis. The development of detailed mathematical models plays an essential role in understanding the mechanism of this heterogeneous process. First, we present two homogenous enzyme kinetics studies, where reactions are carried out in a single well-mixed liquid-phase. The first study focuses on the Michaelis-Menten (MM) mechanism for enzyme kinetics. The mass balances for MM kinetics are simple to write but deceptively difficult to solve; consequently, various approximate solutions have been offered over the past 50 years, none of which works in all cases. We generate a uniformly-valid time-dependent solution that converges accurately for any combination of initial conditions, and we systematically define where each previous solution fits within the new solution. In the second study, we investigate the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl <b>cellobioside</b> by Thermobifida fusca Cel 5 A, a retaining endocellulase, and develop a mechanistic model for its hydrolysis and transglycosylation in the enzyme's active site. Our work extends previous treatments by providing criteria that justify the use of the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) and provide an integrated form of the resulting rate expression. The results can be extended to other retaining glycosyl hydrolases acting on nitrophenol glycosides. Next, we present a heterogeneous two-phase kinetics model for the hydrolysis of dense cellulose fibers by cellulase enzymes. The model reveals that the shapes of the time-dependent liquid phase concentration curves can appear nearly identical even when different underlying mechanisms are dominant. The results substantiate the importance of including penetration and local reaction history in cellulase kinetics models and of more carefully measuring the evolving shapes of fibers when applying such models. Finally, we review our collaborative efforts to develop a synthetic cellulose substrate with controlled microstructure and physical properties...|$|E
