25|$|Some {{evidence}} can {{be gathered}} from the 'usual suspects', like Caesar's De Bello Gallico, who discusses some aspects of Celtic laws in {{his account of the}} Gaulish Wars, specifically his famous excursus on the Gauls, but also in some other passages. Some of these passages allow us to confirm the existence, in some Iron Age Celtic laws, of some of the legal principles which can be reconstructed from early medieval Celtic laws as likely elements of common Celtic law, increasing the likelihood of any such generalised reconstruction. Other passages <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> about particular legal practices in individual Gaulish societies, which are specific for just the society described, without allowing any greater generalisations.|$|E
25|$|Due to Belyi's theorem, {{the action}} of Γ on dessins is {{faithful}} (that is, every two elements of Γ define different permutations {{on the set of}} dessins), so the study of dessins d'enfants <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> much about Γ itself. In this light, it is of great interest to understand which dessins may be transformed into each other by {{the action of}} Γ and which may not. For instance, one may observe that the two trees shown have the same degree sequences for their black nodes and white nodes: both have a black node with degree three, two black nodes with degree two, two white nodes with degree two, and three white nodes with degree one. This equality is not a coincidence: whenever Γ transforms one dessin into another, both will have the same degree sequence. The degree sequence is one known invariant of the Galois action, but not the only invariant.|$|E
25|$|Surprisingly, gauge {{symmetry}} {{can give}} a deeper explanation {{for the existence of}} interactions, such as the electric and nuclear interactions. This arises from a type of gauge symmetry relating to the fact that all particles of a given type are experimentally indistinguishable from one another. Imagine that Alice and Betty are identical twins, labeled at birth by bracelets reading A and B. Because the girls are identical, nobody would be able to tell if they had been switched at birth; the labels A and B are arbitrary, and can be interchanged. Such a permanent interchanging of their identities is like a global gauge symmetry. There is also a corresponding local gauge symmetry, which describes the fact that from one moment to the next, Alice and Betty could swap roles while nobody was looking, and nobody would be able to tell. If we observe that Mom's favorite vase is broken, we can only infer that the blame belongs to one twin or the other, but we cannot tell whether the blame is 100% Alice's and 0% Betty's, or vice versa. If Alice and Betty are in fact quantum-mechanical particles rather than people, then they also have wave properties, including the property of superposition, which allows waves to be added, subtracted, and mixed arbitrarily. It follows that we are not even restricted to complete swaps of identity. For example, if we observe that a certain amount of energy exists in a certain location in space, there is no experiment that <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> whether that energy is 100% A's and 0% B's, 0% A's and 100% B's, or 20% A's and 80% B's, or some other mixture. The fact that the symmetry is local means that we cannot even count on these proportions to remain fixed as the particles propagate through space. The details of how this is represented mathematically depend on technical issues relating to the spins of the particles, but for our present purposes we consider a spinless particle, for which {{it turns out that the}} mixing can be specified by some arbitrary choice of gauge θ(x), where an angle θnbsp&=nbsp&0° represents 100% A and 0% B, θnbsp&=nbsp&90° means 0% A and 100% B, and intermediate angles represent mixtures.|$|E

500|$|The most {{commonly}} given {{answer is that}} we attribute consciousness to other people because we see that they resemble us in appearance and behavior; we reason that if they look like us and act like us, they must be like us in other ways, including having experiences {{of the sort that}} we do. [...] There are, however, a variety of problems with that explanation. [...] For one thing, it seems to violate the principle of parsimony, by postulating an invisible entity that is not necessary to explain what we observe. [...] Some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett in an essay titled The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies, argue that people who give this explanation do not really understand what they are saying. [...] More broadly, philosophers who do not accept the possibility of zombies generally believe that consciousness is reflected in behavior (including verbal behavior), and that we attribute consciousness on the basis of behavior. [...] A more straightforward way of saying this is that we attribute experiences to people because of what they can do, including the fact that they <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> about their experiences.|$|E

[...] In Merleau-Ponty's account, whereas art {{is an attempt to}} capture an individual's perception, science is anti-individualistic. [...] In the preface to his Phenomenology of Perception, Merleau-Ponty presents a phenomenological objection to positivism: that it <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> nothing about human subjectivity. All that a scientific text can explain is the particular individual experience of that scientist, which cannot be transcended. For Merleau-Ponty, science neglects the depth and profundity of the phenomena that it endeavors to explain.|$|E
2500|$|The metaphysical {{distinction}} between necessary and contingent truths {{has also been}} related to a priori and a posteriori knowledge. A proposition that is necessarily true is one whose negation is self-contradictory (thus, {{it is said to}} be true in every possible world). Consider the proposition that all bachelors are unmarried. Its negation, the proposition that some bachelors are married, is incoherent, because the concept of being unmarried (or {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "unmarried") is part of the concept of being a bachelor (or part of the definition of the word [...] "bachelor"). To the extent that contradictions are impossible, self-contradictory propositions are necessarily false, because it is impossible for them to be true. Thus, the negation of a self-contradictory proposition is supposed to be necessarily true. By contrast, a proposition that is contingently true is one whose negation is not self-contradictory (thus, it is said that it is not true in every possible world). As Jason Baehr states, it seems plausible that all necessary propositions are known a priori, because [...] "ense experience <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> only about the actual world and hence about what is the case; it can say nothing about what must or must not be the case." ...|$|E

2500|$|Soil forms from parent rocks through {{physical}} {{disintegration of}} rocks and by chemical alteration of the rock fragments. The types of soil minerals <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> if the environment was cool or warm, wet or dry, or whether the water was fresh or salty. Because CRISM is able to detect many minerals that form in soil, a goal was to use the instrument to help decipher ancient Martian environments. CRISM has found a characteristic layering pattern of aluminum-rich clays overlying iron- and magnesium-rich clays in many areas scattered through Mars' highlands. Surrounding Mawrth Vallis, these [...] "layered clays" [...] cover {{hundreds of thousands of}} square kilometers. Similar layering occurs near the Isidis basin, in the Noachian plains surrounding Valles Marineris, and in Noachian plains surrounding the Tharsis plateau. The global distribution of layered clays suggests a global process. Layered clays are late Noachian in age, dating from the same time as water-carved valley networks. The layered clay composition is similar to what is expected for soil formation on Earth - a weathered upper layer leached of soluble iron and magnesium, leaving an insoluble aluminum-rich residue, with a lower layer that still retains its iron and magnesium. Some researchers have suggested that the Martian clay [...] "layer cake" [...] was created by soil-forming processes, including rainfall, at the time that valley networks formed.|$|E
