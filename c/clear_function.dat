5|$|The brain {{controls}} {{the rate of}} breathing, mainly by respiratory centres in the medulla and pons. The respiratory centres control respiration, by generating motor signals that are passed down the spinal cord, along the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm and other muscles of respiration. This is a mixed nerve that carries sensory information back to the centres. There are four respiratory centres, three with a more clearly defined function, and an apneustic centre with a less <b>clear</b> <b>function.</b> In the medulla a dorsal respiratory group causes the desire to breathe in and receives sensory information directly from the body. Also in the medulla, the ventral respiratory group influences breathing out during exertion. In the pons the pneumotaxic centre influences the duration of each breath, and the apneustic centre seems to have an influence on inhalation. The respiratory centres directly senses blood carbon dioxide and pH. Information about blood oxygen, carbon dioxide and pH levels are also sensed {{on the walls of}} arteries in the peripheral chemoreceptors of the aortic and carotid bodies. This information is passed via the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves to the respiratory centres. High carbon dioxide, an acidic pH, or low oxygen stimulate the respiratory centres. The desire to breathe in is also affected by pulmonary stretch receptors in the lungs which, when activated, prevent the lungs from overinflating by transmitting information to the respiratory centres via the vagus nerve.|$|E

40|$|Nonlinear <b>clearing</b> <b>functions</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} in the literature as metamodels to represent the behaviour of production resources that can be embedded in optimisation models for production planning. However, most <b>clearing</b> <b>functions</b> tested to date use a single-state variable to represent aggregate system workload over all products, which performs poorly when product mix affects system throughput. <b>Clearing</b> <b>functions</b> using multiple-state variables have shown promise, but require significant computational effort to fit the functions and to solve the resulting optimisation models. This paper examines the impact of aggregation in state variables on solution time and quality in multi-item multi-stage production systems with differing degrees of manufacturing flexibility. We propose multi-dimensional <b>clearing</b> <b>functions</b> using alternative aggregations of state variables, and evaluate their performance in computational experiments.

To gain insight we focus on the dual prices of capacity and demand in a single-stage single-product production-inventory system, and discuss their interpretation. In particular, we examine the behavior of two different production planning models: a conventional linear programming model and a nonlinear model that captures queuing behavior at resources in an aggregate manner using nonlinear <b>clearing</b> <b>functions.</b> The classical linear programming formulation consistently underestimates the dual price of capacity due to its failure to capture the effects of queuing.

40|$|In {{this study}} we provide {{insights}} into {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>clearing</b> <b>function</b> concept in a hierarchical planning context. The <b>clearing</b> <b>function</b> is a mathematical representation of the relation between the Work-In-Process (WIP) and the throughput of a production process. We use it in a deterministic order release planning model to anticipate the dynamics of the operational level, which is subject to uncertainties. A multi-period single-item order release and scheduling problem is considered in which the delivery schedule of the orders is determined through the planned lead times, and the capacity loading decisions are separated from the order release decisions in a way so as to plan for on-time deliveries. Early or late delivery of the orders, which are released and delivered in batches, has not been considered explicitly in previous studies on <b>clearing</b> <b>functions,</b> and it significantly affects the inventory costs. Both linear and non-linear <b>clearing</b> <b>functions</b> are tested using a simulation approach. The results indicate that modeling the clearing of WIP by a shop should be based on the short-term operational dynamics of the shop rather than on the long-term average shop behavior, since it improves the consistency between the operational planning and scheduling levels of the hierarchy.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Supply chain design {{problems}} can be analyzed as cooperative linear production games. The maximal total payoff and the optimal coalition of a “market responsive ” supply network {{can be obtained from}} the solution of the mixed-variables Linear Programming problem. Then, using duality theory, the “Owen set ” can be constructed in order to allocate the payoff among the members of the optimal coalition. However, it is shown that for a classical aggregate planning model, such an allocation scheme may be unfair and its stability critical. Two techniques are proposed to correct this defect. The first one consists in introducing transfer payments among the players of the optimal coalition. Then, as this technique is not always feasible, a second technique is proposed. It relies on an improved representation of capacitated resources through <b>clearing</b> <b>functions.</b> It is shown that a better payoff allocation mechanism can then be computed through an appropriate tuning of <b>clearing</b> <b>functions...</b>|$|R

[...] His original submission 27.3 included plans for the medals to be held together by invisible magnets, concealing a cavity on the inside where an athlete could store a memento, and having an onsite engraver etch the sounds of the last ten minutes before a medal event onto the medal itself.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two parts. In the first part, we use nonlinear <b>clearing</b> <b>functions</b> that relate the expected output of a production resource in a planning period to the expected work in process (WIP) inventory level over that period to develop improved formulations for capacity expansion problems. We exploit {{the properties of the}} <b>clearing</b> <b>function</b> to develop a pseudo-polynomial time solution for the single stage capacity expansion problem. This procedure then forms the basis for two constructive greedy heuristics and a Lagrangian heuristic for the multistage problem. The latter procedure also provides lower bounds on the optimal value. We present computational experiments showing that the proposed heuristics obtain high-quality solutions in modest CPU times. ^ As an alternative solution for the multistage problem, we propose a column generation procedure that employs the pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for the single-stage problem to solve sub-problems and generate new columns. The fractional solution to the LP relaxation obtained by column generation is then used to construct a feasible solution. Computational experiments on randomly generated test problems show that the procedure consistently produces near-optimal solutions in shorter CPU times than the Lagrangian heuristic. We also use the column generation formulation to obtain lower bounds in an exact branch and bound algorithm, and show that this new procedure is able to obtain exact solutions to problems that are significantly larger than those that were solved with previous methods. ^ In {{the second part of the}} thesis, we present a planning model that allocates production capacity between production and engineering activity to capture the tradeoff between engineering activity that results in increased output in the future, and production that meets demand and generates revenue immediately. The effect of engineering activity is modeled as a concave function of the total number of engineering lots processed to date, while the production facility is represented by a <b>clearing</b> <b>function</b> capturing the nonlinear relationship between resource utilization and lead time.

40|$|Most {{production}} planning models suffer {{from one or}} more of the following limitations: they either (i) ignore the stochasticity of demand, or (ii) ignore the relationship between load and lead time by treating capacity as an upper limit or using fixed lead times, or (iii) ignore the role of work in process (WIP) inventory in buffering against uncertainty; or (iv) make all the decisions at the beginning of the planning horizon with no simple way to adjust the decisions other than re-solving the problem on a rolling horizon basis. In this thesis, using: (i) <b>clearing</b> <b>functions</b> to capture the load and lead time dependency, (ii) chance constraints to capture both demand stochasticity and WIP contribution towards buffering, and (iii) linear decision rules to provide flexibility in the decision making mechanism, we propose a tractable model for single stage single product systems that addresses the limitations of the existing models.
