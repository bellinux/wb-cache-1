Quality analysis of samples ensures that the correct active components are present for medicinal use. Thin layer chromatography has been used extensively to determine the quality of plant extracts and could just as readily be applied to the assessment of quality of homoeopathic mother tinctures. The development of a multidimensional technique allows for greater quality analyses of these extracts. Materials and Methods The Salvia officinalis sample was extracted and the one dimensional thin layer <b>chromatographic</b> <b>plate</b> development of extracted sample was performed according to the German Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia (GHP).
