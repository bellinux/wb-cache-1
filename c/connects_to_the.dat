5|$|Another {{transitional}} {{feature of}} Dimetrodon is a ridge {{in the back}} of the jaw called the reflected lamina. The reflected lamina is found on the articular bone, which <b>connects</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> quadrate bone of the skull to form the jaw joint. In later mammal ancestors, the articular and quadrate separated from the jaw joint while the articular developed into the malleus bone of the middle ear.

Part of the saccule will eventually give rise and connect to the cochlear duct. This duct appears approximately during the sixth week and <b>connects</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> saccule through the ductus reuniens.|$|E

Poole Bridge, a narrow bascule bridge constructed in 1927, connects the town centre and Hamworthy. Approval for a second bridge was given by the Department for Transport in 2006 and the £37million Twin Sails bridge was completed in 2012.

50|$|Unlike with {{discrete}} FET transistors, {{the substrate}} terminal is not <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> source connection.

The substrate terminal of the p-channel MOSFET is thus <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> positive supply voltage potential and the substrate terminal of <b>the</b> n-channel MOSFET <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> negative supply voltage potential.|$|R
5|$|The Aire and Calder still fulfils its {{original}} purpose of linking Leeds and Wakefield with York and the Humber (and thence the Trent), although the routes by which this is achieved have changed significantly.

Beyond Leeds, the Leeds and Liverpool Canal carries boats over the Pennines. The Calder and Hebble Navigation, which <b>connects</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Navigation at Wakefield, allows boats to reach the Huddersfield Broad and Narrow Canals, and the Rochdale Canal. The Selby Canal <b>connects</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ouse, from where boats can travel upstream to reach York, Boroughbridge and Ripon, or downstream to the River Derwent. Beyond Goole are the Humber and hence Hull, Immingham, and the North Sea.
