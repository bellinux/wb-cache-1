In this paper, we introduce a notion of qualitative robustness for risk measures, concerning the sensitivity of a risk mea-sure to the uncertainty of dependence in risk aggregation.

We also give approximations and inequalities for aggregation and diversification of VaR under dependence uncertainty, and derive an asymptotic equivalence for worst-case VaR and ES under general conditions.

40|$|Banking is so {{inherently}} risky {{that we need}} powerful {{public policy}} interventions to make it stable. But these banking risks can be present and indeed can be even more severe in a shadow banking system, or in a system which involves inter-linkages between bank balance-sheets, shadow bank balance-sheets, and capital markets. ” “Given the enormous cost which instability can produce, and given the uncertain benefits which this complexity has delivered, our regulatory response should therefore entail a bias to prudence – a bias against complex interconnectivity, against procyclical market contracts, and against allowing maturity transformation or high leverage to develop in unregulated institutions or markets. ” Adair Turner, p. 19 and p. 36 1 Overarching remarks The Financial Stability Board (FSB) mentions key issues of shadow banking such as excessive maturity liquidity transformation, immense leverage, procyclicality, highly complex and deeply intertwined credit intermediation chains as well as regulatory arbitrage.

However, quantitative specifications of the proposals are still missing. Even in the regular sector, standards are often far too low. A recent example is the renewed weakening of Basel III rules in terms of liquidity standards (Master). In order to be effective, the proposed measures must be substantial enough.

40|$|Economic {{authors have}} {{underlined}} the deep inroads of economic thinking into competition ( EU ) and antitrust ( US ) policies. Analysing the 70 s and 80 s, some have {{gone so far}} as to refer to this phenomenon as a ?revolution? (Kwoka & White [1989] ; Dumez [1990]). Prima facie, they cannot be dismissed. The economics vocabulary and concepts, even when used as rhetoric (McCloskey [1994]), has pervaded in competition and antitrust literature. The various economic criteria set forward in guidance or <b>consultative</b> <b>documents</b> such as ?greenpapers? in the EU or ?guidelines? in the US is another example. Yet a fair deal of renowned microeconomists remain skeptical. They stress that microeconomics develops according to its own academic agenda, increasingly losing touch with the practicalities of the markets. The academic analytical tools become more and more complex and do not provide with straight answers. But what could really be said about the status of economics in the antitrust decision making process? What can economists claim from their involvement in such matters? To tackle these issues, some distance with the current debates is necessary. Only an historical approach will provide the means to put into perspective the impact of antitrust economic analysis and controversies on the dynamic of markets. Also, concentrating on a particular industry will enable to avoid generalities. The paper selects the cement industry as an empirical material. The focus is made on two important topics in industrial economics: pricing, with the basing point system antitrust case which has arisen in the US in the late 30 s and along the 40 s (Supreme Court decision, 1948); and industry structure, with the antitrust case on vertical integration which has run along the 60 s (?Statement of general policy enforcement?, Federal Trade Commission [1967]).

5000|$|A Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Bill was {{introduced}} to the House of Commons by Home Secretary John Reid on 20 July 2006 to create new offences of corporate manslaughter, in England and Wales, and corporate homicide, in Scotland. Originally, the Bill proposed that the offence would require a company's or organisation's activities to be so managed or organised by its senior managers as to cause a person's death, and to amount to a [...] "gross breach" [...] of a duty of care owed to the deceased. The requirement for the failure of management or organisation to have been [...] "by its senior managers" [...] was dropped in Standing Committee. The Bill also sought to abolish the common law offence of manslaughter by gross negligence so far as it applies to corporations. A juristic person cannot be imprisoned, but the penalty would be an unlimited fine as for the existing common law offence. The Bill received royal assent on 26 July 2007, becoming the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007. The Act came into force on 6 April 2008.

[...] Robinson published the first <b>consultative</b> <b>document</b> on reorganisation and the need for administrative reform of the National Health System. One compromise he instituted was to reduce the number of hospital beds, under an argument of current under-utilization, and in agreement with the medical profession. [...] In return, the government lifted the limits on fees that medical consultants could charge to patients. These actions helped to form the basis for the 1966 General Practitioner's Charter, which Robinson negotiated with Dr. James Cameron, the General Medical Services Committee chairman. [...] Robinson also placed emphasis on nursing, appointing Sir Brian Salmon to a special committee of management experts and nurses, which looked into ways to advise and prepare senior staff at hospitals for their posts.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Reports and <b>consultative</b> <b>documents</b> published at national level since about 1980 have indicated that British Industry must look to modern technology and also educate and train its workers on a 'broad base', with an 'integrated' approach. Traditionally, and still very much the mode of operation, teaching has been confined within subject boundaries. A research group was established by Professor Bajpai consisting of the author, Mr Rod Bond (Burleigh Community College, Loughborough) {{and a few others}} working overseas to investigate a teaching strategy based on an interrelated approach to teaching mathematics. Measurement was chosen as the first topic of investigation using this approach which then formed the basis for further research undertaken by the two research workers of the group whose work is reported in the form of two theses. This thesis aims to show that mathematics is naturally related to science and technology in industrial practice and that when taught in an interrelated way it would be more interesting and have more relevance to real applications in technology-based employment at craft and technician levels. To help establish the case experiments carried out by the author are referred to; these include a few case studies, a questionnaire survey and results analysed from more than five hundred basic mathematics tests. The various kinds of mathematics taught in further education are described and compared with mathematics in a practical context as seen from a case study within an engineering training school. Next a survey of mathematics at work shows that, like the training school, there is a task associated with the mathematics which is also related to science or technology or both. Another case study in the pharmaceutical industry lends further support to the way mathematics is used in industry. Much of the mathematics also seems to be basic and used in association with measurement and a particular task. It was decided by the research group that a tape/slide programme on measurement for students and educators should be developed by the author and tested in different situations. Teaching modules on relevant mathematical topics based on the interrelated approach were constructed for students with strong support from industry in the form of materials and advice. Testing of these modules, in their original and revised forms after feedback, is described. These trials were also carried out in other establishments. Modules based upon the interrelated approach developed by the author formed a basis for promoting the underlying philosophy behind this approach. These were presented to educators in in-service training and staff development programmes in the north western region of the UK with success. Observations and conclusions drawn clearly indicate that this type of method makes mathematics more interesting and relevant for students of different abilities and backgrounds. Finally pointers are given in the thesis as to the wider use and promotion of this approach for teaching mathematics in further education...|$|R
