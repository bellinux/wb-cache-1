5|$|It was {{announced}} that TecToy has developed a new Genesis console that not only looks almost {{identical to the original}} model of the Sega Genesis known as the Genesis III, but also has a traditional <b>cartridge</b> <b>slot</b> and SD card reader which will be released in June 2017.|$|E
5|$|Reviews of the Nintendo DSi were {{generally}} positive; although IGN and bit-tech decried the console's lack of exclusive software and {{removal of the}} GBA <b>cartridge</b> <b>slot,</b> its added functionality caused many journalists to recommend it {{to those who had}} not purchased a previous DS model. Numerous critics were disappointed with the limited resolution of DSi's cameras, though others such as Ars Technica and GameSpot agreed they were adequate for the handheld's display. CNET and PCWorld considered the DSi Shop {{to be the most important}} buying incentive for current DS owners. Some critics believed the DSi XL was not an essential upgrade. GamePro and Wired UK, on the other hand, praised the DSi XL's larger screens for improving the gaming experience and revitalizing older DS games.|$|E
50|$|The two <b>cartridge</b> <b>slots</b> are {{designed}} to share data between the games. The <b>cartridge</b> placed in <b>slot</b> 1 is the game that will be played, while the <b>cartridge</b> in <b>slot</b> 2 supplies additional data {{for use in the}} main game. Nine of the thirteen SuFami Turbo titles make use of this system.|$|R

25|$|Uemura {{added an}} eject lever to the <b>cartridge</b> <b>slot</b> {{which was not}} really necessary, but he felt that {{children}} could be entertained by pressing it. He also added a microphone to the second controller {{with the idea that}} it could be used to make players' voices sound through the TV speaker.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Japanese Famicom was {{predominantly white}} plastic, with dark red trim. It featured a top-loading <b>cartridge</b> <b>slot,</b> grooves {{on both sides}} of the deck in which the hardwired game controllers could be placed when not in use, and a 15-pin expansion port located on the unit's front panel for accessories.|$|E
25|$|MSX {{standard}} requires {{at least}} 1 <b>cartridge</b> <b>slot,</b> most MSX models have 2. These slots are interchangeable, so {{in most cases}} {{it makes no difference}} in which slot a cartridge is inserted. The physical connector is a 50 pin (2 x 25 contacts), standard 2.54mm (0.1 inch) pitch edge connector. Using these cartridge slots, a wide variety of peripherals could be connected.|$|E

5000|$|TV hookup, {{joystick}} {{support and}} <b>cartridge</b> <b>slots</b> were already found on regular C64 machines. Hence normal C64s were already recognized as [...] "game consoles" [...] despite actually being home computers with integrated keyboards.|$|R
50|$|The IBM PCjr {{was also}} seldomly sold without a floppy disk drive, {{but it also}} had two ROM <b>cartridge</b> <b>slots</b> {{on the front of}} the unit - a much more {{convenient}} and reliable option for loading software.|$|R
25|$|Aside from minor {{adjustments}} to reflect its hardware design differences, the system software of the Nintendo 2DS is otherwise {{identical to that}} of the 3DS, remaining compatible with all games released for the 3DS and DS (excluding those requiring the Game Boy Advance <b>cartridge</b> <b>slot),</b> and offering online features such as Nintendo Network for multiplayer and online gaming, Nintendo eShop for downloading and purchasing games, and StreetPass and SpotPass.|$|E
25|$|When Nintendo {{released}} the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately {{different from that}} of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the <b>cartridge</b> <b>slot</b> design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo’s choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of lower}} incomes and the {{domination}} of the Sinclair Spectrum in the UK, almost all British C64 software used cassette tapes. Few cassette C64 programs were released in the US after 1983, and in North America the diskette was the principal method of software distribution. The <b>cartridge</b> <b>slot</b> on the C64 was also mainly a feature used in the computer's first two years {{on the market and}} became rapidly obsolete once the price and reliability of 1541 drives improved. A handful of PAL region games used bank switched cartridges to get around the 16k memory limit. C64 cartridges normally map into $8000 and depending on the ROM size may extend up to $BFFF, in which case they displace the BASIC ROM. A special ID string is checked for on power-up; if found, the kernel will jump to the starting address specified in the ID string. A few early C64 cartridges released in 1982, used the so-called MAX Mode, a leftover feature of the failed MAX Machine. These cartridges map into $F000 rather than $8000 and displace the kernel ROM. If MAX Mode is used, the programmer will have to provide his own code for handling system interrupts. Disk and tape software normally load at the start of BASIC memory ($801) and use a small BASIC stub (e.g. 10 SYS(2064)) to jump {{to the start of the}} program. Although no Commodore 8-bit machine except the C128 can automatically boot from a floppy disk, some software intentionally overwrites certain BASIC vectors in the process of loading so that execution begins automatically rather than requiring the user to type RUN at the BASIC prompt following loading.|$|E
50|$|This version {{had a real}} {{keyboard}}, not a chiclet keyboard {{like its}} predecessors. The VG-8020 was released in 1984 and featured a Zilog Z80A microprocessor clocked at 3.56 MHz, 64KB of RAM, 16KB of VRAM, and two <b>cartridge</b> <b>slots.</b>|$|R
50|$|It had a Z80 {{compatible}} microprocessor, and ran {{a customized}} version of the CP/M-80 operating system as well as various applications {{from a pair of}} ROM <b>cartridge</b> <b>slots</b> which were treated as drives. For file storage it had a built-in microcassette drive.|$|R
50|$|Tectoy also {{develops}} various Master System and Genesis/Mega Drive derivatives {{targeting the}} low-income market. These consoles {{generally do not}} have the <b>cartridge</b> <b>slots,</b> as games are installed directly on its internal memory. One of these consoles is the Genesis/Mega Drive Portable, a portable Sega Genesis/Mega Drive with 20 games installed onto its memory.|$|R
500|$|In 2009, Chinese company AtGames {{produced}} a Sega Genesis/Mega Drive-compatible console, the Firecore. It features a top-loading <b>cartridge</b> <b>slot</b> and includes two controllers {{similar to the}} six-button controller for the original Genesis. The console has 15 games built-in and is region-free, allowing cartridge games to run regardless of their region. [...] AtGames {{produced a}} handheld version of the console. Both machines have been released in Europe by distributing company Blaze Europe.|$|E
500|$|Cartridges for {{the system}} were {{referred}} to as [...] "Storyware", and {{take the form of}} picture books with a <b>cartridge</b> <b>slot</b> on the bottom. The Pico changes the television display and the set of tasks for the player to accomplish each time a page is turned. Sound, including voices and music, also accompanied every page. Games for the Pico focused on education, including on subjects such as music, counting, spelling, reading, matching, and coloring. Titles included licensed animated characters from various franchises, such as Disney's The Lion King: Adventures at Pride Rock and A Year at Pooh Corner. Sega also released titles including their mascot, Sonic the Hedgehog, including Sonic Gameworld and Tails and the Music Maker.|$|E
500|$|Like the Genesis, the Saturn had an Internet-based gaming service. The Sega NetLink was a 28.8k modem {{that fit}} into the <b>cartridge</b> <b>slot</b> in the Saturn for direct dial multiplayer. In Japan, a now defunct pay-to-play service was used. It {{could also be used}} for web browsing, sending email, and online chat. Because the NetLink was {{released}} before the Saturn keyboard, Sega produced a series of CDs containing hundreds of website addresses so that Saturn owners could browse with the joypad. The NetLink functioned with five games: Daytona USA, Duke Nukem 3D, Saturn Bomberman, Sega Rally, and [...] In 1995 Sega announced it was developing a variant of the Saturn featuring a built-in NetLink modem under the code name [...] "Sega Pluto", but it was never released.|$|E
50|$|The Retrode {{was based}} on an Atmel AVR {{microcontroller}} (AT90USB646) with an integrated USB interface, connecting to <b>cartridge</b> <b>slots</b> and game controller ports via the microcontroller's GPIO pins. Its updateable firmware {{was based on}} the LUFA library by Dean Camera, and was developed mainly by Hullin {{with the help of a}} few users.|$|R
50|$|The console was {{produced}} by different companies and sold with different names. Not every console is compatible with others {{due to differences in}} the shapes and dimensions of the <b>cartridge</b> <b>slots</b> (but all of the consoles are software compatible).Here a table of the consoles grouped by compatibility family (due to the slots).|$|R
50|$|A second {{revision}} of the system, the Super Famicom Box 2, used standard Super Famicom cartridges and had a set of multiple internal <b>cartridge</b> <b>slots</b> of the same setup as the Neo-Geo MVS with similarities to the design used by Nintendo on the Nintendo M82. It can accept up to ten standard Super Famicom cartridges.|$|R
500|$|The [...] is a dual-screen {{handheld}} {{game console}} released by Nintendo. The console launched in Japan on November 1, 2008, and worldwide beginning in April 2009. It {{is the third}} iteration of the Nintendo DS, and its primary market rival is Sony's PlayStation Portable (PSP). The fourth iteration, entitled Nintendo DSi XL, is a larger model that launched in Japan on November 21, 2009, and worldwide beginning in March 2010. Development of the DSi began in late 2006, and the handheld was unveiled during an October 2008 Nintendo conference in Tokyo. Consumer demand convinced Nintendo to produce a slimmer handheld with larger screens than the DS Lite. Consequently, Nintendo removed the Game Boy Advance (GBA) <b>cartridge</b> <b>slot</b> to improve portability without sacrificing durability.|$|E
500|$|Several {{accessories}} {{were created}} for the Game Gear during its lifespan. [...] A TV Tuner accessory plugged into the system's <b>cartridge</b> <b>slot,</b> and allowed one to watch TV on the Game Gear's screen. [...] Released at $105.88 ($186 in 2016), the add-on was expensive but unique for collectors {{and contributed to the}} system's popularity. [...] Another accessory, the [...] "Super Wide Gear", was an accessory that magnified the Game Gear screen to compensate for its relatively small size. [...] Also released was an adaptor (known as the Game Gear Car Adaptor) that plugged into cars or [...] cigarette lighters to power the system while traveling, and the [...] "Gear-to-Gear Cable", an accessory that established a data connection between two Game Gear systems using the same multiplayer game and let users play against each other.|$|E
500|$|After {{making the}} initial {{purchase}} and paying the activation fee, Genesis owners would receive an adapter {{that would be}} inserted into the <b>cartridge</b> <b>slot</b> of the console. [...] The adapter connected the console to a cable television wire, doing so {{by the use of}} a coaxial cable output {{in the rear of the}} cartridge. [...] Starting up a Genesis console with an active Sega Channel adapter installed would prompt for the service's main menu to be loaded, which was a process that took approximately 30 seconds. [...] From there, gamers could access the content they wished to play and download it into their system, which could take up to a few minutes per game. [...] This data would be downloaded into the adaptor's on-board 4 MB [...] RAM, and would be erased when the system was powered off.|$|E
50|$|In South Korea, two {{electronics}} companies released different {{personal computers}} based on Sord M5. The FC-150 was produced and released by LG and the TommyCom was manufactured and launched by Koryo Systems. Both computers supported the Korean alphabet, Hangul. The system specifications of these computers were {{identical to the}} original M5 but they had differently shaped <b>cartridge</b> <b>slots.</b> <b>Cartridges</b> from the Sord M5 or other manufacturers could not be used on these computers directly. LG released some original software including several educational programs and games.|$|R
50|$|All {{this only}} {{applies to the}} fast RAM used on the MSX turboR. External hardware, {{connected}} through <b>cartridge</b> <b>slots,</b> uses timings similar to Z80. Not even the internal ROM of turboR is fast enough for this fetch scheme, so additional chips on the turboR can mirror the contents of ROM into RAM, {{in order to make}} it run faster.|$|R
50|$|There were {{a number}} of {{proprietary}} accessories available including a portable printer, bar code reader, and an early 3.5-inch diskette drive, the PF-10. The disk drives from the HX-20 could also be used. For the ROM <b>cartridge</b> <b>slots</b> a number of applications were available: Basic, CP/M utilities, Portable WordStar, CalcStar, Scheduler, dBase II and Portable Cardbox-Plus.|$|R
500|$|The 32X can be {{used only}} in {{conjunction}} with a Genesis system. [...] It is inserted into the system like a standard game cartridge. [...] The add-on requires its own separate power supply, a connection cable linking it to the Genesis, and an additional conversion cable for the original model of the Genesis. [...] As well as playing its own library of cartridges, the 32X is backwards-compatible with Genesis games, and can also be used in conjunction with the Sega CD to play games that use both add-ons. [...] The 32X also came with a spacer so it would fit properly with the second model of the Genesis; an optional spacer was offered for use with the Sega Genesis CDX system, but ultimately never shipped due to risks of electric shock when the 32X and CDX were connected. [...] Installation of the 32X also requires the insertion of two included electromagnetic shield plates into the Genesis' <b>cartridge</b> <b>slot.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Nintendo DSi {{received}} generally positive reviews. Critics praised {{many of the}} console's {{changes to}} the DS Lite's aesthetic and functionality, but complained that it launched with insufficient exclusive software. IGN's Craig Harris noted that the DSi-exclusive software library and DSi Shop were lacking in content even after five months on the Japanese market. Jeff Bakalar of CNET said that owners of the original DS should consider buying a DSi, but that its only incentive for DS Lite owners was the DSi Shop. PCWorld New Zealand's Jan Birkeland shared Bakalar's opinion, but {{believed that it was}} too early to judge the quality of DSi Shop software. Many critics were disappointed by the removal of the GBA <b>cartridge</b> <b>slot,</b> but some of them, such as PCWorlds Darren Gladstone, Bit-techs Joe Martin, and IGN's Harris and Lowe, believed that it was a reasonable exchange for SD card support and the DSi Shop. However, Bakalar stated, [...] "We'd gladly give up the 4 millimeters [...] {{to be able to play}} any Game Boy Advance game." ...|$|E
500|$|Featuring a {{total of}} eight {{processors}} the Saturn's main central processing units are two Hitachi SH-2 microprocessors clocked at 28.6MHz and capable of 56 MIPS. The system contains a Motorola 68EC000 running at 11.3MHz as a sound controller, a custom sound processor with an integrated Yamaha FH1 DSP running at 22.6MHz capable of up to 32 sound channels with both FM synthesis and 16-bit PCM sampling at a maximum rate of 44.1kHz, and two video display processors, the VDP1 (which handles sprites, textures and polygons) and the VDP2 (which handles backgrounds). Its double-speed CD-ROM drive is controlled by a dedicated Hitachi SH-1 processor to reduce load times. The Saturn's System Control Unit (SCU), which controls all buses and functions as a co-processor of the main SH-2 CPU, has an internal DSP running at 14.3MHz. The Saturn contains a <b>cartridge</b> <b>slot</b> for memory expansion, 16 Mbit of work random-access memory (RAM), 12 Mbit of video RAM, 4 Mbit of RAM for sound functions, 4 Mbit of CD buffer RAM and 256 Kbit (32 KB) of battery backup RAM. Its video output, provided by a stereo AV cable, displays at resolutions from 320×224 to 704×224 pixels, and is capable of displaying up to 16.77 million colors simultaneously. Physically, the Saturn measures [...] The Saturn was sold packaged with an instruction manual, one control pad, a stereo AV cable, and its 100V AC power supply, with a power consumption of approximately 15W.|$|E
50|$|The FC Twin uses a card edge {{connector}} {{rather than a}} ZIF connector and has separate circuitry and <b>cartridge</b> <b>slots</b> for the NES and SNES. With the Super Game Boy adaptor, Game Boy cartridges can also be used. It features a single-pole, double-throw power switch with open position; the switch can be thrown to 8-Bit (NES) or 16-Bit (SNES), or set to off.|$|R
50|$|On 20 April 2009, NASA Ames {{announced}} that it would replace ten of their 20-year-old silo tape libraries with two Spectra Logic T950 tape libraries. This allowed the center to reclaim 1400 sq ft of floor space and increase its storage capacity from 12 petabytes to 32 petabytes. The new tape libraries used 20,000 tape <b>cartridge</b> <b>slots</b> and Linear Tape-Open (LTO-7) drives.|$|R
50|$|This {{device is}} {{designed}} to sit {{on top of the}} Super Famicom, and features two <b>cartridge</b> <b>slots.</b> The premise behind this idea is that games could be produced at a much cheaper rate (not having to rely on Nintendo). Unlike the Aladdin Deck Enhancer, this device was officially approved by Nintendo under the provision that Bandai handle all the hardware manufacturing themselves.|$|R
