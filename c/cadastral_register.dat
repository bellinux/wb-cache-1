To acheive detail understanding of the timeline and the content of each particular proceeding we present the legislation concerning non-contentious procedure of managing land boundaries in Slovenia. In the practical part of the thesis we analyze the court expert's reports of judicial definition of land boundaries which were based on the final order of the Surveying and mapping authority, concluded and recorded after the adoption of the Real-Estate Recording Act in 2006. Most analysed proceedings, regarding the judicial definition of boundaries, were recorded in 2011, changes specified in final judicial acts of these procedures were in a <b>cadastral</b> <b>register</b> mostly recorded within five years or less. In the thesis we focus on the most common issues and technical mistakes in the surveyors reports of judicial definition of land boundaries and the cause for their reasons for the request to complete the report, encountered by surveyors at Ljubljana SMA branch office.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of sustainable land policies {{is in need}} of monitoring methods that go beyond a mere description of the proportion values of land use classes. The annual statistical surface area report on actual land utilization (German: “Bodenfläche nach Art der tatsächlichen Nutzung”), published by the statistical offices of the German federal states and the federation, provides information on a set of pre-defined land use classes for municipalities, districts and federal states. Due to its surveying method of summing up usage information from <b>cadastral</b> <b>registers,</b> {{it is not possible to}} determine previous and subsequent usages of land parcels. Hence, it is hard to precisely indicate to what extent particular land use classes contribute to the settlement area increase. Nevertheless, this information is crucial to the understanding of land use change processes, which is needed for a subsequent identification of driving forces. To overcome this lack of information, a method for the spatial and quantitative determination of previous and subsequent land usages has been developed, implemented and tested. It is based on pre-processed land use data for different time slices, which are derived from authoritative geo-topographical base data. The developed method allows for the identification of land use changes considering small geometric shifts and changes in the underlying data model, which can be adaptively excluded from the balance...|$|R

40|$|The study {{outlined}} here is {{an investigation}} of mining and smelting evidence across eastern Macedonia in northern Greece particularly through the Byzantine (AD 324 - 1453) and Ottoman (AD 1453 - 1912) periods. Diverse evidence for mineral exploration and metallurgical extraction in the ancient and medieval past exists throughout this region bounded by the Strymon and Nestos river valleys. Through an integrated approach to survey, site characterization and scientific analysis of metallurgical debris it has been intended to approach issues of interrelatedness between subsistence and production sectors, and address questions relating to Byzantine economy and technological complexity. Documentary evidence from antiquity, late Byzantine Mount Athos charters and Ottoman <b>cadastral</b> <b>registers</b> refer to local, large-scale iron production in the region. Although at present there exists no {{clear understanding of the}} chronology for the various production sites, surveys and analytical studies carried out elsewhere have been proven enlightening towards that end. Further, the actual practices represented at these sites remains to be established. Although the mainstay of the metallurgical traditions seems to be iron metallurgy, analyses of slag from sites across Macedonia, particularly high arsenic concentrations, and the occurrence of speiss among the debris, suggested that precious metal extraction could have been an important but peripheral activity. This coupled with documentary evidence allows for the potential of eastern Macedonia to be a minor but significant source of precious metals in the Byzantine world. The current study focuses on the survey and sampling of four smelting sites in the region and scientific analysis by various instrumental techniques undertaken in view to characterizing the metallurgical processes represented in each case. The production sites are characterized by spatial and scalar variation reflecting distinct modes of organizing labour and fluctuations in specialization, intensity and time-length of operations. Analytical data provide an overview of the technical parameters which in turn represent human capacities and choices deeply rooted in social and cultural information. Eventually the dynamics of practice and technical choices for organizing seasonal smelting ventures are being perceived as identity forging incidents among the medieval rural communities of the region...|$|R

Uncertainties on the implementation of a 3 D cadastre in a specific country exist due to technological developments on the one hand and cadastral and legal developments on the other hand. Also two disciplines are involved (i. e. technical and legal experts) who need to understand the impact of 3 D cadastre in each other's domain for proper 3 D cadastre developments. To meet these uncertainties, the proposed 3 D cadastre NL solution consists of a two-phase process. The aim of the first phase is to gain experiences by introducing evolving technologies in the legal domain of 3 D cadastre.

40|$|Abstract]: The {{surveying}} profession {{continues to}} suffer from a shortage of personnel {{in a time when}} demand for surveyors is increasing. Concurrently, the ongoing improvements in surveying technology have been proven in making surveys more efficient, thereby passing time savings on to clients and the general public who rely on an accurate system of land ownership. The current system of re-establishing boundaries in Australia is based on survey monument evidence, and relies on the education and experience of a <b>Registered</b> <b>Cadastral</b> Surveyor to make sense of this evidence. Given the shortage of surveyors, there is concern that surveying services may not be provided in a timely manner, or worse, that extra pressure on surveyors may lead to cases of incorrect boundary reestablishment. This project aims to investigate the potential for recent software technology to perform the boundary re-establishment process, with a view to alleviating the Registered Surveyors workload. To achieve this aim, a capable software program will be used to re-establish several general boundary problems, and these answers will be compared to that of a <b>Registered</b> <b>Cadastral</b> Surveyor and long established reinstatement doctrine. Results will show that in some of the tested scenarios the software solutions are the same as the human results, but many were found to be in disagreement. It will be observed that the methods used by the software in solving such problems are, although mathematically sound, not capable of the analysis and reasoning of a Registered Surveyor. This project will provide a foundation for future research into the programming of boundary reinstatement software, and will enable informed decision making in surveying practices as to the potential for this software to alleviate staff workloads...|$|R

40|$|In Denmark the <b>{{cadastral}}</b> <b>register</b> and the {{cadastral map}} are digital. The mayor argument for computerising {{of the map}} was broader use of the cadastre. It was assumed that a digital cadastral map together with other digital maps could improve GIS use. Furthermore {{it was assumed that}} a digital cadastral map could increase the possibilities for registration of property regulations in the cadastre. The aim was a multipurpose cadastre. Since 1997 four new themes have been registered in the Danish cadastre. The four all are the registration of regulations according to new land use legislations. Regional authorities carry out the practical registration of the themes. The implementations of the registrations have been top down. The top down implementation and the new users give some challenges for the cadastral authority – the NSC- to make the processes of the registrations of the new themes efficient and to make the quality of the registrations sufficient. The challenges of the multipurpose cadastre have legal, organisational and technological aspects. The challenges and the aspects are primarily related to the use of a digital cadastral map. Depending on the point of view {{one of the biggest challenges}} have been building up and maintaining cadastral knowledge at new users of the cadastre. In the preparation of registration of a new theme it is important that the legislation authority and the NSC exchange knowledge in a broad sense. The first question from the NSC to the legislation authority is really to find out what is the purpose and why the regulation should be registered in the cadastre.

Posebno se analiziraju elementi prema kojima se maksimalna hipoteka razlikuje od fiksne hipoteke. Razrađuju su specifičnosti i podvrste maksimalne hipoteke te posebno kontinuirana hipoteka. Maximum amount {{mortgage}} is a subtype {{of mortgage}} for the securing, {{to the maximum}} amount, {{of one or more}} claims whose total amount is not specified at the moment of concluding a mortgage loan contract, but can be specified. It is used for securing claim(s) whose total amount cannot be known at the moment of entering into contract so an approximate amount is stipulated instead. Maximum amount mortgages are mostly characterised by their connection to a specifiable claim. This way they derogate to a substantial degree two traditional principles of security interests on real property: accessoriness (by securing future planned and possible claims) and speciality (at the moment of placing a mortgage lien the claim is not specified, but is specifiable). Certainly, these special characteristics entail differences in relation to the so-called fixed-rate mortgage. This primarily pertains to the stage in which the mortgage is created both in terms of the contents of the mortgage contract and entry into the <b>cadastral</b> <b>register.</b> Unspecifiedness and the maximum possible amount of claim guaranteed by a maximum mortgage are its main peculiarities. The amount of claim can remain unspecified for a longer period, even {{for as long as the}} mortgage is “concealed”, i. e. during the pre-settlement phase. However, in the settlement phase the amount of claim, paid from the value of the mortgaged property, can no longer remain unspecified, at least in terms of the principal. Maximum mortgage is usually constituted as a guarantee mortgage, a credit mortgage, or as one of the two variants of the continuous-repayment mortgage. It can also be constituted as one of the following: a mortgage for own or another’s debt; annuity mortgage; mortgage on state-owned property; joint mortgage; mortgage on civil fruits; submortgage; public notary mortgage (on the basis of an agreement between parties); public notary mortgage on a vessel or an aeroplane or a yacht on the basis of an agreement between parties; mortgage on the basis of a directly enforceable public notary act; mortgage on a property under construction, etc...|$|E

It is the generation heavily involved in bringing the <b>cadastral</b> maps and <b>registers</b> from analogue to computerised environments. A unique event with unique knowledge built up for that purpose. Cadastral maps required extra attention in computerisation {{in order to keep}} the spatial data consistent and accessible. After conversion the data have been harmonised in many countries using extended or linked data models; the data quality has been improved; complete archives have been scanned and digital workflows have been introduced.

In addition to the cadastral map itself, the computerisation of all land, cadastral and mortgage, documentation has made the French cadastral and mortgage system more reliable, flexible and economical, and has contributed to maintaining a form of social order for 200 years in the area of land ownership. It has thus helped to consolidate a climate of trust. The computerisation of the system has also led to major productivity gains for the administration and offers new services to administration officers, land and real estate professionals, and to the general public...|$|R
