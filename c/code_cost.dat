40|$|Event {{detection}} is {{a typical}} application of wireless sensor networks. The existing approaches of event detection usually employ certain event models that are constructed with prior domain knowledge. The resulting event detection processes appear to be cost-inefficient, which require either intensive data exchanges among neighboring nodes or caching large columns of history data. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} issue of locating event in wireless sensor network without locations. This involves two tasks, namely detecting an event and identifying an area in the network where the event occurs. Motivated by the real system, we propose a model-free approach for event detection called CCD (<b>Coding</b> <b>Cost</b> based event Detection). <b>Coding</b> <b>cost</b> is a metric that quantifies the diversity of a set of sensor readings. Incorporated into the inherent data collection mechanism, CCD passively constructs a gradient map of <b>coding</b> <b>cost</b> throughout the network. An event is then detected where a change point of gradient appears and identifies the event pattern automatically. CCD is fully distributed and does not incur apparent communication overhead. We implement CCD and evaluate its performance with extensive experiments and simulations. The results demonstrate that CCD is accurate, scalable, and applicable to a variety of sensor networks. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{software}} testing community had much less awareness and debate about UML then software design and development communities, and {{has largely been}} absent as the modeling standard was developed. This is an important issue, because in many software development organizations, the cost of testing can {{account for more than}} 40 % of the total development cost for a software system. In software engineering, system modeling is the process of formulating a representation of a real system in an abstract way to understand its behavior. Software testing encourages reusing these models for testing purpose. This expedites the process of test case generation. The objective {{of this paper is to}} explore the possibility of using the UML for {{software testing}} and how much does development of <b>code</b> <b>cost</b> with and without the models. This paper emphasis on automation of software testing which is widely used in organizations to reduce manual effort and project cost. The testing process that encourages the automation of software testing is Model based testing i. e, MBT.

In this paper, we describe an approach to enable the user to obtain a COTS glue code integration {{risk analysis}} with no inputs other than the set of glue <b>code</b> <b>cost</b> drivers the user submits to get a glue code integration effort estimate with the COnstructive COTS integration cost estimation (COCOTS) tool. The risk assessment approach is built on a knowledge base with 24 risk identification rules and a 3 -level risk probability weighting scheme obtained from an expert Delphi analysis. Each risk rule is defined as one critical combination of two COCOTS cost drivers that may cause certain undesired outcome if they are both rated at their worst case ratings. The 3 -level nonlinear risk weighting scheme represents the relative probability of risk occurring with respect to the individual cost driver ratings from the input. Further, to determine the relative risk impact, we use the productivity range of each cost driver in the risky combination to reflect the cost consequence of risk occurring. We also develop a prototype called COCOTS Risk Analyzer to automate our risk assessment method. The evaluation of our approach shows that it has done an effective job of estimating the relative risk levels of both small USC eservices and large industry COTS-based applications...|$|E
40|$|Context. Reports {{suggest that}} defects in <b>code</b> <b>cost</b> the US {{in excess of}} 50 billion per year to put right. Defect Prediction is an {{important}} part of Software Engineering. It allows developers to prioritise the code that needs to be inspected when trying to reduce the number of defects in code. A small change in the number of defects found will have a significant impact on the cost of producing software. Aims. The aim of this dissertation is to investigate the factors which a ect the performance of defect prediction models. Identifying the causes of variation in the way that variables are computed should help to improve the precision of defect prediction models and hence improve the cost e ectiveness of defect prediction. Methods. This dissertation is by published work. The first three papers examine variation in the independent variables (code metrics) and the dependent variable (number/location of defects). The fourth and fifth papers investigate the e ect that di erent learners and datasets have on the predictive performance of defect prediction models. The final paper investigates the reported use of di erent machine learning approaches in studies published between 2000 and 2010. Results. The first and second papers show that independent variables are sensitive to the measurement protocol used, this suggests that the way data is collected a ects the performance of defect prediction. The third paper shows that dependent variable data may be untrustworthy as there is no reliable method for labelling a unit of code as defective or not. The fourth and fifth papers show that the dataset and learner used when producing defect prediction models have an e ect on the performance of the models. The final paper shows that the approaches used by researchers to build defect prediction models is variable, with good practices being ignored in many papers. Conclusions. The measurement protocols for independent and dependent variables used for defect prediction need to be clearly described so that results can be compared like with like. It is possible that the predictive results of one research group have a higher performance value than another research group because of the way that they calculated the metrics rather than the method of building the model used to predict the defect prone modules. The machine learning approaches used by researchers need to be clearly reported in order to be able to improve the quality of defect prediction studies and allow a larger corpus of reliable results to be gathered...|$|E

This allows to regularize the shapes of the layers and a very elegant handling of occlusions. (2) We present an efficient, parallel algorithm for extracting super-resolved layers, based on TV-filtering. I...|$|R
