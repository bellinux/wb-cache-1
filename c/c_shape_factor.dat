The function of <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> is to define the leakage term between the matrix block and fracture conduits. Different geometric assumption of the double porosity medium resulted in different <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> and consequently the leakage term. The influence of various <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> based on different geometric assumptions on their matrix-fracture transfer rate has been studied in this study.

The {{aim is to}} {{identify}} an optimal combination of <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> to measure granule shape and roughness. Granules were prepared from microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), alpha-lactose, microfine cellulose (MFC), and dextrin, using a small-scale high-shear mixer. Granule shapes were analysed by measuring weight, by microscopic analysis, and by sedimentation analysis in olive oil. A comparison was made among (1) the aspect ratio, (2) the circularity, (3) a new projection <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> defined in this paper, (4) the <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> e(R), (5) the radial <b>shape</b> <b>factor,</b> (6) One-Plane-Critical-Stability (OPCS), (7) the Stokes' <b>shape</b> <b>factor,</b> and (8) a new mass <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> defined in this paper. Besides {{the evaluation of the}} <b>shape</b> <b>factors,</b> (9) a roughness factor R is defined. When the shape of granules is evaluated, there can be effects of both shape and surface roughness. The scale of scrutiny of the measurement determines whether or not a <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> is affected by surface roughness. We chose to call a protrusion smaller than 60 mum a roughness, and a larger protrusion a shape effect. The best evaluation of granule shape is obtained when shape and roughness are described by different parameters. The aspect ratio, the mass <b>shape</b> <b>factor,</b> OPCS, e(R) and the radial <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> could not significantly discriminate between some of the different shapes. The other three <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> give distinct differences in value for all different shapes used in this study. Of these <b>factors,</b> Stokes' <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> was rejected because of the high viscosity of the oil needed, which results in a significant temperature dependency. Circularity and the new projection <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> both work very well for our granules. The combination of the roughness factor with the new projection <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> will provide a good description of granule shape and roughness. Granule shapes were(C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

Particle sizing methodology was evaluated using laser diffraction, time-of-flight and Andersen cascade impactor measurements combined with electron microscopy and surface area determination. Particle interactions, assessed on the basis of powder bulk density and inverse gas chromatography surface energy measurements, were compared with the aerodynamic forces generated by a dry-powder dispersion device. The supercritically produced material showed by a factor of seven reduced tensile strength of the aggregates and indicated a two-fold increase of fine particle fraction deposited in a cascade impactor when blended with lactose. This effect was explained by the reduced particle aggregation at low differential air pressures and flow rates. A relatively small value of aerodynamic stress required to disperse supercritically produced particles in comparison to micronized material comes from: (a) lower bulk density (loose aggregate structure), (b) larger volume mean diameter, (<b>c)</b> larger aerodynamic <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> and (d) smaller specific free energy of S-SX particles, in this order of priority.

The {{authors have}} investigated, in another paper, the problem {{related to the}} {{definition}} of a “set of <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> ” in order to declare the feasibility of a product through sheet hydroforming. In particular the defined <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> are three different a-dimensional coefficients by which it is possible to declare the feasibility of a product through the calculation, in different sections, of the three previous <b>shape</b> <b>factors.</b> The robustness of this methodology is related to the correct calculation of the “limit value ” of each <b>shape</b> <b>factor.</b> In fact the feasibility is reached if, in any section, the calculated <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> are higher than their respective limit values. In this paper the authors have performed an extensive numerical and experimental campaign, taking into account a different geometry respect to that of the first paper, in order to: re-calculate the limit value for each <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> and, then, verify the correctness of the limit values exposed in the previous first paper. The numerical campaign has been used, after the evaluation of the accuracy of the numerical model, in order to study the feasibility of the product without engaging the hydroforming machine. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) has been extensively used in order to investigate and define each <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> with a proper comparison to the macro feasibility of the chosen component geometry. The limit values that have been calculated by the authors in this paper are slightly different from those calculated in the first paper. From this point of view it is possible that, although the <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> are a-dimensional coefficients, they are affected by different choices of the users as, for example, the dimensions of the initial blank.

40|$|Quarry rock is a {{frequently}} applied {{construction material}} in hydraulic engineering. The main reason is its unique stability capacities in environments of high hydrodynamic activity. Furthermore, quarry rock is produced and handled relatively easily and available at numerous locations across the globe. The size, or more precisely, {{the dimension of}} rock {{plays an important role}} in the realization of granular hydraulic structures. In general, two definitions are applied for the dimension of quarry rock, viz. : the nominal diameter and the sieve diameter. The ratio of both diameters is referred to as the <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> of quarry rock and is frequently applied to express the one diameter in the other. Quarry rock however consists of a practically infinite variety of sizes and shapes and as a result the material is typically graded. For quarry gradings therefore the <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> is based on ‘median’ values for the nominal diameter and sieve diameter, which are related to the fifty percent cumulative mass percentage of the grading. In a report published by G. J. Laan (1981) the value of the <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> for quarry rock was determined to be 0. 84. Unfortunately, Laan passed away and the concerned report is missing from the libraries. Despite the resulting lack of theoretical background the value of 0. 84 is still widely applied in hydraulic engineering practice, as is recommended by - amongst other literature - the Rock Manual (2007). In this thesis the value of the <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> has been reassessed. By conducting experiments on 21 samples, consisting of 200 - 250 rocks, extracted from various gradings, it is found that the <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> is reasonably well represented by means of a Gaussian distribution. The average value and standard deviation are 0. 86 and 0. 24 respectively. Furthermore, it is concluded that the value of the <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> is not constant within a grading. The value of the <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> slightly decreases for increasing rock size. Such relation is however not discerned over the coarseness of the tested gradings. According to the tested gradings, the value of the <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> is independent from the shape of the rock, in terms of both elongation and blockiness. For individual rock however, on average the value of the <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> slightly increases for an increase of elongation as well as blockiness. As a consequence it cannot be completely ruled out that, for gradings consisting of a significantly higher percentage of relatively elongated or blocky rock compared with the tested gradings, the <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> will increase. Like the <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> for rock gradings, the <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> of individual rocks is also represented reasonably well by means of a Gaussian distribution. The average value and standard deviation are 0. 84 and 0. 083 respectively. Moreover, it is found that the <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> of an individual rock may exceed the value of 1. 0. For such rock the nominal diameter exceeds the sieve diameter. Subesequent research should focus on the <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> value for gradings of significantly different coarseness and gradings that consist of a significantly higher percentage of relatively elongated or blocky rock compared with the tested gradings, the <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> will increase. For uncrushed rock it is expected both interests are met. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

The results of VFSA optimization reveal that various parameters show a number of equivalent solutions when shape of the target body is not known and <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> ‘q’ is also optimized together with other model parameters. The study reveals that amplitude coefficient k is strongly dependent on <b>shape</b> <b>factor.</b> This shows that there is a multi-model type uncertainty between these two model parameters derived from the analysis of cross-plots.

In this paper, analytical expressions for the <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> for a rectangular and an elliptical vacuum chamber as a function of longitudinal position along the circumference in a storage ring are derived using an approach in which the position of electrons at the focusing quadrupole is transformed to the location of defocusing quadrupole and vice versa to define the parts of the vacuum chamber, where the loss of electrons takes place at the location of quadrupoles.

40|$|This {{research}} {{has tried to}} find a relation between particle settling velocity and shape. This was done by taking the settling velocity log-contrast of a non-spherical particle and an equivalent spherical particle. This log-contrast should be the logarithmic function of a certain <b>shape</b> <b>factor.</b> Settling data of several shapes were taken from previous authors and with those data several existing and new <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> were tested to form a single relation. Recently a simple equation was developed which can explicitly predict the settling velocity of spherical particles for any Reynolds number. This equation was tested to be fairly accurate for spherical data. However, the spherical data showed a systematic error which needs to be resolved for the equation to be perfectly accurate. The equation also showed to be fairly accurate for non-spherical sieve diameter data. However sieve diameter data cannot be used to define the shape of a particle as there is no direct relation between sieve diameter and actual particle size and shape. In order to find a relation between particle settling velocity and shape, a correct <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> must be found. For that matter several <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> from previous authors were tested on data directly available from previous authors. The existing <b>shape</b> <b>factors</b> were proved to not be able to combine all investigated shapes into a single relation for settling velocity and a new <b>shape</b> <b>factor</b> was found with which a single relation might be formed. This new equation is a generalization of the Corey <b>Shape</b> <b>Factor,</b> the Boekhout <b>Shape</b> Factor: BSF=D_s/(?D_l?^n D_i^(1 -n)). However due to the small amount of data, important data gaps exist so that nothing can be concluded with certainty. Therefore more settling experiments should be done over a large range of Reynolds numbers to be able to conclude whether the Boekhout <b>Shape</b> <b>Factor</b> is the correct link between particle settling velocity and shape.
