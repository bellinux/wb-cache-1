The reports, which are based on the Best Interests of the Child Model of Kalverboer and Zijlstra (2006) and which are drawn up in line with General Comment No. 14 of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, currently fill a gap in Dutch migration law and administrative practice regarding the state’s obligation under international law to take {{the best interests of the}} child into account in every decision concerning children. This chapter presents the preliminary results of a qualitative analysis of the legal effect of submitting the assessment reports by lawyers in Dutch judicial migration proceedings. The reports strengthen the relevant appeal procedures, although the child depends on a lawyer who is able to make a good transposition of social-behavioural expert opinions into legal terms. The reports also enhance compliance with the CRC. However, the best interests of children are not necessarily fairly balanced. Here, General Comment No. 14 may offer an opportunity for lawyers further to substantiate the best interests of the child...|$|E

Almost 163, 000 people sought asylum in 2015, whereof approximately 70, 000 children. The influx challenged the reception system and severe child protection concerns such as disappearances and sexual exploitation of unaccompanied minors were identified. Half of the <b>children</b> that arrived <b>in</b> 2015 came with families but this group have received less attention so far. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the child protection systems around asylum-seeking and returning <b>children</b> <b>in</b> families by identifying child protection concerns and existing gaps in the services provided to this target group. Fourteen semi-structured interviews with twenty individuals belonging to various stakeholder groups such as staff at asylum accommodations, social workers, parents and, volunteer and staff from civil society organisations were conducted in two municipalities in Skåne, Sweden. The data was analysed using thematic analysis and the results are discussed in regards to the Protective Environment Framework. The results suggest that <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>migration,</b> with families, face multiple protection concerns in Sweden. Significant gaps exist in the services provided to these children and there are large disparities between accommodation centres.

Drawing on the experiences of children from rural Burkina Faso and Ghana, the book provides rich material on the circumstances of children's voluntary migration and their experiences of it. Their accounts challenge the normative ideals of what a 'good' childhood is, which often underlie public debates about children's migration, education and work in developing countries The comparative study of Burkina Faso and Ghana highlights that social networks operate in ways that can be both enabling and constraining for young migrants, as can cultural views on age- and gender-appropriate behaviour. The book questions easily made assumptions regarding children's experiences when migrating independently of their parents and contributes to analytical and cross-cultural understandings of childhood.

30|$|Our paper {{contributes}} to the existing literature {{in at least two}} directions. First, although children may be important stakeholders <b>in</b> the <b>migration</b> phenomenon, little attention has been given to <b>children</b> <b>in</b> the analysis of <b>migration</b> decisions <b>in</b> the international <b>migration</b> literature. A few exceptions are Djajic (2008) and Dustmann (2003). In the Chinese context, the dearth of data is an important limit {{to the study of the}} interaction between left-behind children and migration duration. To our knowledge, Connelly et al. (2012) is the only work that thoroughly studies the role of <b>children</b> <b>in</b> the <b>migration</b> decisions of Chinese women using data collected in the early 2000 s. Complementary to their study, we propose an updated and more comprehensive evaluation of how left-behind children affect the return decision. In particular, we use a recent database that covers a period during which both rural–urban migration and a counter-flow of population back to the countryside increased dramatically, which may enable us to better capture recent changes associated with return <b>migration</b> <b>in</b> China. Based on these data, our analysis also adds to the work of Connelly et al. (2012) by examining the whole migrant population (rather than only women at the age of childbearing) and by analysing both complete and incomplete episodes of migration for the entire individual migration history.|$|R

In particular, we find that having children of school-age is a motivation for migrant parents to extend their length of stay in the city, a result we interpret as illustrating the need for migrant parents to accumulate money for their offspring’s education. In contrast, parental time appears substitutable by coresiding grandparents who contribute to delay the parents’ return, especially mothers, when they have pre-school <b>children</b> or <b>children</b> <b>in</b> primary school.

40|$|In 2011 almost 50 % of the {{displaced}} persons {{around the world}} were children but still {{there is a lack}} of migration research about children’s experiences; roles and perspectives (Special issue in Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies Volume 37 Issue 8 2011). The aim of this paper is first and foremost to demonstrate how the leading theories and debates in the debate about ethics of migration lack a discussion of children as moral beings in their own right and that the debate is characterized by an adult discourse and traditional rooted assumptions about children. Secondly; the paper argues that the ethics of migration should acknowledge children as moral beings with agency; interests; rights and experiences in their own right. If children´s rights are acknowledged as morally relevant and if ethical theory should play a relevant role in the future debate of migration and policymaking then it is crucial to take a critical view on the construction of children as moral beings. Thirdly; the paper examines what the implications of future research <b>in</b> ethics of <b>migration</b> can be; if children are acknowledged as moral subjects in their own right. <b>In</b> <b>migration</b> research <b>children</b> are traditionally represented as “passive; needy and different” (Ibid p. 1159). When <b>children</b> are <b>in</b> focus it is often in a fragmented fashion; with a perspective on children as future adults and as passive members of the family. However we can see an increased interest in challenging the traditional rooted assumptions about <b>children</b> <b>in</b> the latest years in the field of migration research as well as in some fields of philosophy. We have not yet seen a similar development in the ethics of migration. This paper analyses some of the leading contributions in the debate about ethics of migration represented by particularly Joseph Carens and David Miller that represents arguments for and against open and restricted borders. The analysis demonstrates how children to a great extent is invisible and that their roles; interests and experiences to a great extent have been left out of the debate. When children are mentioned it is in a fragmented fashion; in an adult-centric discourse; portraying children as reduced to family members and as vulnerable with a special need of protection and care. The paper suggests that more expanded conceptions of children will lead to new and important ethical questions. It concludes that many theoretical questions remain unanswered about the moral status of <b>children</b> <b>in</b> the ethical debate about migration and that the case of children point at gaps and weaknesses in some of the dominating theories about borders. A way to fill these gaps is to a greater extent take into account existing empirical research on <b>children</b> <b>in</b> <b>migration</b> and a growing philosophical research interest <b>in</b> <b>children</b> as moral subjects. The recognition of children as moral beings in their own right is put forward as one way of making ethical theory more applicable and relevant to policymaking and research of <b>migration</b> <b>in</b> the future...|$|R

40|$|Using novel {{household}} {{survey data}} collected between September 2011 and December 2012 on migrant- and non-migrant households in Moldova and Georgia, this paper proposes {{a method for}} measuring and comparing multidimensional <b>child</b> well-being <b>in</b> a <b>migration</b> context. While {{a growing body of}} literature addresses the effects of migration for children “left behind”, relatively few studies have empirically analysed if and to what extent migration implies different well-being outcomes for children. To compare the outcomes of <b>children</b> <b>in</b> current- and non-migrant households, the present paper defines a multidimensional well-being index comprised of six dimensions of wellness: education, material living standards, protection, physical health, emotional health, and communication access. The results of both bivariate and multivariate analysis suggest that migration bears limited consequences for different domains of well-being. In both Moldova and Georgia <b>children</b> <b>in</b> migrant households were found to have a slightly lower probability of attaining material well-being, but <b>in</b> Georgia <b>migration</b> was linked to higher probabilities of <b>children</b> attaining wellbeing <b>in</b> physical health, communication access, and on total index level. The results suggest that when migration has any statistically significant effect on child well-being, it is generally positive and relatively low in magnitude. The impacts of migration appear to differ widely between Moldova and Georgia, however. While migration was seen to have limited effect on the well-being of <b>children</b> <b>in</b> Moldova, it seemed to bear more consequences for <b>children</b> <b>in</b> Georgia, which likely reflects different migration trajectories, mobility patterns, and levels of maturity of each migration stream...|$|R

However, we argue {{that in the case of}} China, there are good reasons to believe that the implied bias should not be too strong because the fertility decision is not fully private and free as it is in other countries.

While equal division among all children is the most favored practice—thus further farm fragmentation is anticipated in the near future—parents with very small land endowment are unable to divide land equally amongall their children and some children are unable to receive land from their parents. The expansion of migration opportunity has not caused fundamental changes in landtransfer practices, but the premarital migration experience of children is negatively associated with land transfer, especially when <b>children</b> settle <b>in</b> the <b>migration</b> destination or marry a person from another province whom they met at the migration destination and move to their partner’s place of origin. The data indicate that, taking advantage of labor migration experience, children of land-poor parents chooseto leave their home province and make a living without land.

40|$|<b>Child</b> <b>migration</b> <b>in</b> Ghana {{has moved}} beyond the {{concerns}} of individual child migrants and their families, to one of national development concerns. Streets, pavements and other public spaces in the cities and towns - especially Accra - are flooded with <b>children</b> engaged <b>in</b> various activities. These children are not only a nuisance to road users and city authorities, but exert pressure on social amenities as well as threat to security. However, {{little is known about}} the education of children when they migrate. This requires research attention, to shed light on the phenomenon. In this study, I explore the motivations for migration of children from Bongo district to Accra in Ghana and examine how migration influences their pursuit of basic education. The study employed a mixed methods design involving observation, interviews with 35 child migrants, community discussions, interviews with experts and schedule officers of government and non-governmental organisations working on issues of child migration. Furthermore, questionnares were administred to 490 (250 migrant and 240 non-migrant) <b>children</b> <b>in</b> 10 schools in the district and their academic performance data obtained and analysed, using Mann-Whitney U Test, to find differences in their performance. Poverty, peer influence and pursuit of education emerged as major motivational factors, while non-migrant school children performed relatively better than their migrant counterparts. Nevertheless, the overall effects of migration on education was found to be mixed. Whereas it was negative or positive for some, others pursued apprenticeship as an alternative. I conclude that <b>children</b> <b>in</b> deprived regions migrate to escape unfavourable living conditions and to accumulate wealth in urban areas. However, involvement <b>in</b> <b>migration</b> has negative effects on performance in class with the likelihood of stalling progress in education.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the various roles that <b>children</b> played <b>in</b> {{the long journey}} westward that many brave families made to frontier settlements during the middle and late nineteenth century. It also analyzes the influences children had on the successful outcomes of those settlements once frontier families reached western lands. It includes information about rural farm settlements, {{in places such as}} Oregon, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Iowa, as well as urban mining towns in California, Nevada, and Colorado. While some authors have discussed frontier children during this time before, the goal of this thesis is to reinforce previous studies while taking a new comparative approach to understanding the importance of children to frontier families. It is comparative in its examination of rural versus urban communities, its consideration of both western migration and settlement of western communities, {{as well as in the}} earlier and later decades of westward settlement that occurred. Following this approach, the examined research is divided into an introduction and four chapters. The introduction allows for the description of research strategies, sources, and methods. It also provides an opportunity to explain specific parameters, pitfalls, and future possibilities associated with this type of research. Following a historiographical chapter on the development of frontier history, the bulk of the thesis material is separated into two main chapters. First, the thesis explores the lives and experiences of pioneer children traveling along similar routes during the 1840 s and early 1850 s to western settlements in the Oregon Territory, mainly Willamette Valley, and gold mining camps in California. The focus for these children is on the arduous journey along the Overland Trail with their families and the important roles that they played in the successful completion of those trips and the initial settlement of western communities. Next, families that settled in rural and urban communities in later decades are presented. The children during this time are examined with a focus on already established western territories and the importance of <b>children</b> <b>in</b> growing and developing prosperous American towns and settlements. By looking at the importance of <b>children</b> <b>in</b> this manner, the research can then be compared to better understand both the differences and similarities of these two groups over time and conclusions can then be made about the essential roles <b>children</b> filled <b>in</b> western <b>migration.</b> The comparisons and conclusions are presented in a closing summative chapter. Understanding the importance of <b>children</b> <b>in</b> western <b>migration</b> and settlement is an important addition to the new western history that is being done within the broader scope of American frontier history. Scholars are no longer strictly viewing the west through the eyes of pioneer men, and it is for this reason that I believe this thesis will add a new variation to existing thoughts on frontier settlement. Although resources are somewhat scarce, the understanding of children and their important roles in western history can be better understood when examined exclusively for the purpose of comparing different settlement groups, rather than taking each individual account on its own.

Special {{attention is paid to}} the role played by personal networks to Eastern and Western destinations as well as investments into the transferability of human capital made by migrants prior to their stay abroad. We find that many determinants and migration patterns are quite similar across the CIS countries under consideration but exhibit some surprising differences to standard results from the migration literature, e. g. the prevalence of older migrants and the low importance of <b>children</b> <b>in</b> the <b>migration</b> decision process. Networks and human capital transferability are the main explaining factors for the migration and destination decision, a result proofing robust after correcting for endogeneity. We expect that migration is likely to grow in importance for some countries at the European Borderlands, as networks develop and the costs of migration decrease. However, our analysis reveals that fears of brain drain have little substance as the educational background of migrants is rather low. As a considerable number of migrants have invested into destination country specific human capital prior to migration, this improved human capital endowment can benefit both, migrants and the society of sending countries, alike.

It examines the role that school may play <b>in</b> preventing the <b>migration</b> of vulnerable youth to become homeless "street children". Specific focus {{is placed on the}} correlations found between children's attendance in school, their reports of abuse or support in their family, and their status of living "on the street" full-time or part-time. Methods This study is from quantitative interview data gathered from 1, 098 children and youth between 5 and 24 years old on the streets of Moshi and Arusha, Tanzania, over a 48 -hour period during the school year on October 26 th and 27 th, 2006. Respondents were given survey questions about their home, school and street life experiences, in order to measure the impact of outreach work being performed by a Tanzanian NGO. Interviewers used purposive sampling, approaching all young people who appeared to be under the age of 25 years within a number of precincts in each town known to be where 'street children' were known to congregate. Results Results suggest that regular attendance in school may be a significant protective factor for <b>children</b> <b>in</b> preventing <b>migration</b> to the street life. Statistical analysis revealed that those young people who dropped out of school had nearly 8 times higher chances for ending up on the streets permanently than those who attended school daily. Conclusions This study supports the new concept of "multi-layered social resilience", providing evidence from research completed by one NGO on how community-based organizations can help enhance resilience in a broader social context, spanning individuals, households and community structures. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{diversity}} of the experience of migrants to rural, peri–urban, and urban areas using a unique longitudinal data set from the Philippines. In 2003 and 2004, the Bukidnon Panel Study followed up with 448 families in rural Mindanao who were previously interviewed in 1984 / 85 by the International Food Policy Research Institute and the Research Institute for Mindanao Culture, Xavier University, and surveyed both a sample of their offspring living in the same area as well as a sample of those who had moved away to different locations. Parents (original respondents) and children who formed separate households in the same locality were interviewed in 2003; original respondents' offspring that migrated to different rural and urban areas were interviewed <b>in</b> 2004. Thus, <b>migration</b> patterns were examined using the full listing of children of the original respondents as well as a special survey of 257 of their migrant offspring who were tracked down in 2004. This migrant survey focused on differences <b>in</b> the <b>migration</b> experience of males and females who moved to other rural areas, poblaciones (the administrative seats of municipalities or towns), and urban areas. We follow this with an examination of the determinants of children's location, using the sample of all <b>children.</b> <b>In</b> addition to <b>migration</b> to rural, peri–urban, and urban destinations, we explicitly consider the case where the individual leaves his or her parental residence, but remains in the same village, as a locational choice.
