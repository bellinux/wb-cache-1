In separate studies, <b>cattle</b> preferred <b>creeping</b> foxtail to smooth brome (Bromus inermis), reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinaceus) and tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum).

40|$|Tonight {{we come to}} {{our second}} meeting on the sixth day of {{creation}} and our discussion {{will be on the}} future evolution of man. Many scientists think that man will soon be able to take his future evolution into his own hands by means of genetic engineering or eugenics using the recently discovered tool of recombinant DNA. Let me begin our meeting as usual by reading the Scriptural account of the sixth day: And God said: &quot;Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds; <b>cattle</b> and <b>creeping</b> things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds. &quot; And it was so. And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, and everything that creeps upon the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. Then God said, &quot;Let us make man in our image, and after our likeness: and let him have dominion over all the earth. &quot; So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. And God blessed them, and God said to them, &quot;Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth. &quot; And God said, &quot;Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with its seed in its fruit: you shall have for food. And to every beast of the earth, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life. I have given every green plant for food. &quot; And it was so. And God saw that everything that he had made, and behold it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning a sixth day (Gen 1 : 24 - 31). Dr. Arthur Schonfield Evolutionists have recognized for many years that there is still much to learn about the subject, especially the mechanisms involved. Mutation, natural selection, and isolation can't be the whole story. I think this is the underlying reason for the great excitement in the scientific community about recombinant DNA. I was quite surprised to hear during our discussion on the origin of species both Mrs. Stepan and Rev. Swezey defend the antiquated theory of fixism. If man can cross the so-called &quot;species barrier &quot; in the laboratory by recombining the DNA of different species, surely the same thing must also be occurring in nature, though of course ther...|$|R

The fourth {{thing that}} God created, it was (in mine opinion) that chaos, or first matter, {{with which he}} in the six days framed this earth, with its appurtenances; for the visible things that are here below, {{seem to me to}} be {{otherwise}} put into being and order, than time, the angels, and the heavens, they being created in their own simple essence by themselves: But the things that are visibly here below, whatever their essence and nature be, they were formed of that first deformed chaos. [...] "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth, and the earth was without form and void" [...] (Gen 1:1,2). He saith not so of the heavens; they, as I said, were at first stretched forth as a curtain; indeed they were afterwards garnished with the beauty which we now behold; but otherwise they had, at their first instant of being, that form which now they have. This seems clear by the antithesis which the Holy Ghost put between them, God created the heaven and the earth, but [...] "the earth was without form and void" [...] (Gen 1:2). The earth was without form, &c., without order; things were together on a confused heap; the waters were not divided from the earth, neither did those things appear which are now upon the face of the earth; as man, and beast, fish, fowls, trees, and herbs; all these did afterwards shew themselves, as the word of God gave them being, by commanding their appearance, in what form, order, place and time he in himself had before determined; but all, I say, took their matter and substance of that first chaos, which he in {{the first day of the}} world had commanded to appear, and had given being to: And therefore 'tis said, God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, herbs, trees, &c., (v 12) and that the waters brought forth the fish, and fowl, yea, even to the mighty whales (vv 21,22). Also the earth brought forth <b>cattle,</b> and <b>creeping</b> things (v 24). And that God made man of the dust of the ground (3:19). All these things therefore were made of, or caused by his word distinctly to appear, and be after its kind, of that first matter which he had before created by his word. Observe therefore, That the matter of all earthly things was made at the same instant, but their forming, &c., was according to the day in which God gave them their being, in their own order and kind. And hence it is said, that after that first matter was created, and found without form and void, that the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters; that is to work, and cause those things to appear in their own essence and form, which, as to matter and substance, was before created: Wherefore it follows, And God said, Let there be light; and God divided the light from the darkness, &c. Now he set to putting in frame that which before lay in disorder and confusion: And this was a great part of the six days' work; I say, a great part, but not all; for (as I said) before that time, the angels, and the heavens were made; yea, after the beginning of the morning of the first day. I am of the belief, that other things also, that were formed after, were not made of that first chaos, as the sun, the moon, the stars, the light, the souls of men, and possibly the air, &c. The sun, and moon, and stars, are said to be made the fourth day, yet not of the body of heaven itself, much less, in my opinion, of any earthly matter: God made them, and set them in the firmament of heaven (vv 16,17). So the light that was made before, it seems to be a thing created after the heavens and the earth were created: Created, I say, as a thing that wanted a being before, any otherwise, than in the decree of God: and God said, Let there be light; Let it have a being (v 3). And so, though the body of man was made of the substance of earth, yet as to his soul, it is said, God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul (2:7).|$|R
