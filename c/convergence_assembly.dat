The modelling of an assembly process as a hybrid dynamic system {{has been shown to}} be a very effective strategy to incorporate both the continuous and discrete natures of the interaction between the workpiece and its environment.

40|$|A new {{discrete}} event controller synthesis {{methodology for}} the successful <b>convergence</b> of <b>assembly</b> tasks is pre- sented. Discrete event control {{has been shown to}} be a very effective strategy to incorporate both the continuous and discrete natures of an assembly task. A discrete event controller synthesis methodology for forcecontrolled systems is highly desirable because force control is naturally compliant and compliance reduces sensitivity to positioning errors. In this paper we present a number of experimental results for the new controller synthesis method, including a complete assembly task. These experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the combination of discrete event control and force control for assembly tasks, successfully completing the assembly with positioning errors of up to 50 ram and orientation errors of up to 30...|$|R

The modelling of an assembly process as a hybrid dynamic system {{has been shown to}} be a very effective strategy to incorporate both the continuous and discrete natures of the interaction between the workpiece and its environment. Prior works have presented separate controller synthesis methodologies for both velocity- and force-controlled systems and here we present the next step, a hybrid force/velocity con- troller. Force control is a natural paradigm for assembly as it is fundamentally compliant and velocity control is used to ensure that frictional forces are overcome during sliding motions. Experimental results for a four degree of freedom assembly task are presented, demonstrating the robustness of the system to very large positioning and orientation errors...|$|R
40|$|A {{discrete}} event controller (DEC) synthesis {{methodology for}} the successful <b>convergence</b> of <b>assembly</b> is presented. The modelling of an assembly process as a hybrid dynamic system (HDS) {{has been shown to}} be a very effective strategy to incorporate the interaction between the workpiece and its environment. In addition, this modelling has allowed the derivation of realistic conditions on the DEC for the convergence to the full assembly, known as p-convergence. In this paper we propose a DEC synthesis methodology resulting in an optimal p- convergence by combining the maintaining and enabling conditions proposed by McCarragher and Asada and dynamic programming. The applicability of the proposed synthesis methodology is then demonstrated for a dual peg insertion task. 1 Introduction The modelling, analysis and control synthesis for a successful assembly need to consider not only the robotic system but also its environment and the presence of uncertainties such as workpiece tolerances, posit [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Summary. External {{actuation}} in self-reconfigurable modular robots {{promises to}} allow modules to shrink down in size. Synchronous external motions promise to allow fast <b>convergence</b> and <b>assembly</b> times. XBot is a modular system that uses synchronous external actuation, {{but has a}} limited range of reachable configurations stemming from a single motion primitive of a module rotating about another. This paper proposes to extend the motion primitives by using moves with two modules swinging in a dynamic chain. The feasibility of these motion primitives are proven experimentally. A parameterization of the external actuation motion profiles is ex-plored to define a space of physically valid motion profiles. The larger the space, the more robust the motion primitives will be to inexact initial conditions and to imprecision in the external actuation mechanisms. Additionally, this paper proves a configuration of XBot meta-modules can reach any configuration using just these motion primitives. ...|$|R

40|$|A new hybrid dynamic {{controller}} synthesis {{methodology for}} the successful <b>convergence</b> of force-controlled <b>assembly</b> tasks with friction is presented. Hybrid dynamic modeling {{has been shown to}} be a very effective strategy to incorporate both the continuous-time and discrete-event natures of an assembly task. Previously, hybrid dynamic controllers have used velocity control. This paper develops a hybrid dynamic controller that uses force control, the accepted paradigm for constrained motion systems such as assembly tasks. Frictional forces present a significant problem for force control and cannot be neglected in the development of a controller. Constraints on the control command are developed for each type of single-contact transition, and then further constraints are developed to ensure that superposition can be used for multicontact situations. Experimental results are presented for the new controller synthesis method performin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A new graph-theoretic {{approach}} to neural structure identification with implications for information-theoretic optimization is proposed for dynamic link architecture neural networks. The method addresses {{the organization and}} interconnection of feature-representing multicellular units (MCUs) at the network architecture level. It incorporates indices for the identification of both dynamic and static data pathway and binding code links between neurons within an MCU and between different MCUs. It also proposes a new objective function for optimization of a measure of conditional entropies and mutual information properties of the system. The method {{is based on an}} extension of a method of graph-theoretic information flow analysis recently proposed by Akuzawa and Ohnishi, here called Akuzawa-Ohnishi Analysis (AOA). Background. Damasio [1]-[2] has proposed a general theoretical framework for understanding the neural basis of memory and consciousness at the systems level. His model proposes that timelocked multiregional retroactivation of feature-representing networks in sensory and motor cortices, coordinated by binding codes from <b>convergence</b> zone cell <b>assemblies,</b> constitutes a fundamental neural substrate for higher cognitive functions in the central nervous system (CNS). In this model objects (entities and events) are put together from representational fragments o...|$|R
40|$|Structural and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar {{data from}} the Yunkaidashan Belt {{document}} kinematic and tectonothermal characteristics of early Mesozoic Indosinian orogenesis {{in the southern part}} of the South China Block. The Yunkaidashan Belt is tectonically divided from east to west into the Wuchuang-Sihui shear zone, Xinyi-Gaozhou block, and the Fengshan-Qinxi shear zone. Indosinian structural elements ascribed to the Indosinian orogeny include D 2 and D 3 deformation. The early D 2 phase is characterized by folding and thrusting with associated foliation and lineation development, related to NW-SE transpression under amphibolite- to greenschist-facies conditions. This event is heterogeneously overprinted by D 3 deformation characterized by a gentle-dipping S- 3 foliation, subhorizontally to shallowly plunging L 3 lineation, some reactived-D 2 folds and low-angle normal faults. The D 3 fabrics suggest a sinistral transtensional regime under greenschist-facies metamorphism. The timing of the D 2 and D 3 events have been constrained to the early to middle Triassic (similar to 248 - 220 Ma) and late Triassic (similar to 220 - 200 Ma) respectively on the basis of 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology and regional geological relations. The change from oblique thrusting (D 2) to sinistral transtension (D 3) may reflect oblique convergence and crustal thickening followed by relaxation of the overthickened crust. In combination with the regional relations from Xuefengshan to Yunkaidashan and on to Wuyishan, the early phase of the Indosinian orogeny constituted a large-scale positive flower structure and is related to the intracontinental <b>convergence</b> during the <b>assembly</b> of Pangea in which the less competent South China Orogen was squeezed between the more competent North China and Indosinian Blocks.
