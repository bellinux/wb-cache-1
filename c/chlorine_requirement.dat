High amounts of such extract (up to 10 g/L) were required to clarify humic acid solutions whereas 0. 5 g/L were used to remove 90 % of initial turbidity of a surface water.

40|$|The most cornmon {{method of}} {{disinfecting}} waste water effluent is by chlorination which destroys pathogenic microorganisms in the waste water stream. A field study {{conducted at the}} Wahiawa Wastewater Treatment Plant {{on the island of}} Oahu, Hawaii was established to determine the effect of aeration on disinfection efficiency in the chlorine contact chamber. A range of chlorine dosages was applied to the waste water entering the contact chamber for aeration rates of 0, 2. 36 x 10 ^(- 3), and 4. 72 x 10 ^(- 3) std. m^ 3 /s (0, 5, and 10 std. cfm) of air. The chlorine demand and <b>chlorine</b> <b>requirement</b> of the waste water was then determined by measuring the chlorine residual and fecal coliform concentration in the effluent leaving the chlorine contact chamber. The addition of aeration into the chlorine contact chamber enhanced the disinfection efficiency of chlorine, while its effect on chlorine residual loss in the contact chamber was not readily apparent; however, a greater drop in the chlorine residual was observed for higher chlorine dosages during periods of aeration, in comparison to nonaerated conditions.

40|$|Abstract: Incidence {{of round}} heart disease was {{prevalent}} in starting turkey poults in studies at our experimental facility. Two experiments {{were conducted to}} evaluate two dietary factors that {{may have contributed to}} increased susceptibility of poults to round heart disease. Experiment 1 consisted of 4 dietary treatments in which dietary chlorine ranged from 0. 17 to 0. 29 % as a result of salt addition, but dietary sodium was maintained at 0. 17 %. Experiment 2 consisted of poults fed the same pre-starter (0 - 3 wk of age) and starter (3 - 6 wk of age) feeds. The diets were fed either in a mash or crumbled form with or without a post-hatch supplement {{the first day of the}} experiment. Poults were placed approximately 4 hr after departure from the hatchery. There was no evidence of round heart disease mortality in Experiment 1. According to body weight data, the dietary <b>chlorine</b> <b>requirement</b> was estimated to be 0. 21 % when adequate dietary sodium and potassium are fed. Mortality was increased in Experiment 2 due to round heart disease when crumbles were fed. The addition of a post-hatch supplement did not affect growth or mortality. The results of these studies indicate that feeding crumbles to poults increased round heart disease incidence starting at 6 days of age due to faster growth rate...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1999 The {{financial}} and process benefits {{of improving the}} mill fiber line are widely acknowledged. However, process optimization of the fiber line is difficult due to the complex behavior of pulp and paper systems. The dissertation project focused on application of multivariate analysis techniques for understanding and improving fiber line performance. Models for prediction and variability analysis of kappa number and total bleaching cost were developed using data generated by pulping and bleaching operations. The research project led to refinement of earlier methods of data preprocessing and development of algorithmic solution for the data time shifting problem. Multivariate statistical techniques were used to analyze sources of kappa and bleaching cost variability for Weyerhaeuser Longview mill and Georgia Pacific Ashdown mill. For the Weyerhaeuser Longview mill, factor analysis allowed development of models that successfully predict kappa number out of a continuous digester and O 2 delignification stage. The most important cause of kappa variability in the continuous digester {{was found to be}} mischarges in alkali. Variations in kappa number can be reduced by 45 % in the digester and 40 % in the O 2 delignification reactor if variables correlating with the important factors are brought under control. None of the multivariate techniques were successful in predicting K-number for the Georgia Pacific Ashdown mill. The main reason for poor prediction was that the digester was already under tight control as evident from low (6. 12 %) coefficient of variation of K-number. Processes under tight control appear to generate datasets with minimal correlation structures. Such datasets are not suitable candidates for the purposes of predicting output variables such as K-number. In the bleaching study, principal component analysis as well as factor analysis models with fourteen upstream variables successfully predicted bleaching cost trend. However, neural networks bleaching cost predictions were poor. Factor analysis and PCA models of the bleaching cost indicated that most of the bleaching cost variability was either due to lignin factor (which represents pulping and washing variables) or due to digester column stability represented by outlet device amperage. A method to compare results from various multivariate methodologies was also developed. The factor model with fourteen variables achieved the highest score on comparison scale for bleaching cost study. Both the lignin and digester stability factor point at the digester being the major source of bleaching cost variability. It appears that there are variations in pulp lignin content (or some latent variable) that are not measured by the K number test at the Decker, but results in changes in the <b>chlorine</b> <b>requirements</b> at the D/C stage. In this situation, bleaching cost predicted by the model may be used as a soft sensor to manipulate temperature, steam flow in digester to produce pulp with uniform bleach chemical requirements (i. e., consistent latent variable variation). This way cost variability will be reduced, as presumably the variation in lignin content will be minimized...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the <b>chlorine</b> nutritional <b>requirement</b> of Japanese Quails during the laying phase, based on performance and egg quality parameters. A total of 240 Japanese quails were distributed according to a randomized block design, with five treatments and six replicates, with 8 birds each. The experiment lasted 84 days, divided in four cycles of 21 days each. Treatments consisted of a basal diet formulated to meet the nutritional <b>requirements,</b> except for <b>chlorine,</b> and four supplementation levels with ammonium chloride, generating the levels 0. 8; 1. 6; 2. 4; 3. 2 and 4. 0 g/kg. The parameters evaluated were: feed intake (g/bird/day), egg production (egg/bird/day), egg weight (g), egg mass (g), egg mass conversion (g/g), conversion per dozen eggs (kg/dz), weight of yolk (g/ 100 g of egg), albumen (g/ 100 g of egg) and shell (g/ 100 g of egg), specific gravity (g/cmÂ³) and shell thickness (mm). As a result of this study, feed intake, egg weight, weights of albumen, yolk, shell and specific gravity were not affected by treatments. There was a quadratic behavior for egg production, egg mass, egg mass conversion, conversion per dozen eggs and shell thickness according to the chlorine levels in the diets, with the requirements for those parameters established at 1. 54; 1. 37; 1. 39 and 2. 78 g/kg, respectively. The recommendation is 1. 39 g/kg of chlorine and 244. 22 mEq/kg of electrolyte balance in diets for Japanese quails...|$|R
40|$|Beside its {{application}} as a diffusion barrier between the Al metallization and the Si substrate TiN {{is a possible}} candidate for local interconnects to further increase the packing density of VLSI circuits. The dry etching process to pattern the TiN has high demands on the etch rate selectivity to the underlying layers like SiO 2 or CoSi 2 and the photoresist mask. To adress these <b>requirements</b> <b>chlorine</b> based and bromine based etch processes have been investigated and characterized. Etching tool was a Tegal 1581 HRe triode reactor with magnetic confinement (MCR), working at low pressures equal to 5 m Torr to obtain the desired high anisotropy. TiN etch processes using Cl 2 are distinguished by high TiN etch rates of approximately equal to 350 nm/min and selectivities to SiO 2 of approximately equal to 8 : 1, while the HBr processes have lower TiN etchrates of equal to 140 nm/min, but better selectivities to resist of approximately equal to 1. 5 : 1. On the basis of HBr chemistry, an optimized pro cess with a selectivity to CoSi 2 of nearly 10 : 1, capable of etching sub-Mym TiN structures, will be presented...|$|R
