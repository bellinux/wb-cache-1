On June 19 the Rowan and the Bremerton were fired on but no hits resulted.|$|E

500|$|On 9 July 1916, {{the scout}} cruiser , 54 T, 73 F and another torpedo boat raided the Otranto Barrage, the Allied naval {{blockade}} of the Strait of Otranto, {{which resulted in}} the sinking of two drifters, and damage to two more. Ten days later, 65 F and 66 F sank the Italian submarine Balilla off Lissa. On 8 October, 68 F encountered the Italian [...] off San Giovanni di Medua, but after a brief chase was able to reach the <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shore <b>battery.</b> On 16 November 1917, 61 T and 65 F were part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minesweeping force supporting the bombardment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] Italian shore battery at Cortellazzo near the mouth of the Piave. All boats were due to have their aft torpedo tube replaced by a single Škoda [...] L/30 anti-aircraft gun in late 1918, {{but it is not clear}} whether this actually occurred. 52 T ran aground near Split in December 1918. Following World War I, the Kaiman-class boats were allocated to Great Britain, Italy and the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed Yugoslavia). Great Britain and Italy scrapped their boats, but the Yugoslavs retained 54 T, 60 T, 61 T and 69 F as T12, T9, T10 and T11 respectively. All four were discarded and broken up between 1928 and 1930.|$|R

With an aging model, the lifetime <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> can be precisely predicted {{with respect to}} the State-of-Charge (SoC) <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery.</b> The mathematical model in terms of state variables involving smart BMS is presented in this work. The state space model is crucial as an accurate model and is able to represent the complex dynamic behavior <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> system. <b>A</b> numerical case study is done to verify the model obtained through mathematical derivations by adopting the prominent RC battery model from literature. Furthermore, the well-known Kalman filter (KF) is applied to estimate the SoC <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> system. With accurate prediction of SoC of battery system, its lifetime could be prolonged, and thereby saving us substantial cost. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
