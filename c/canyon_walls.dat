5|$|Mesa Verde is {{best known}} for a large number of well-preserved cliff dwellings, houses built in alcoves, or rock {{overhangs}} along the <b>canyon</b> <b>walls.</b> The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard sandstone, held together and plastered with adobe mortar. Specific constructions had many similarities but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the <b>canyon</b> <b>walls.</b> In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{entire area}} {{underwent}} uplift during the Laramide orogeny between 70 and 40 {{million years ago}} which was {{also part of the}} Gunnison Uplift. This raised the Precambrian gneiss and schist that makes up the <b>canyon</b> <b>walls.</b> During the Tertiary from 26 to 35 million years ago large episodes of volcanism occurred in the area immediately surrounding the present day Black Canyon. The West Elk Mountains, La Sal Mountains, Henry Mountains, and Abajo Mountains all contributed to burying the area in several thousand feet of volcanic ash and debris.|$|E

5|$|Along crater and <b>canyon</b> <b>walls,</b> {{there are}} {{thousands}} of features that appear similar to terrestrial gullies. The gullies tend to be in the highlands of the southern hemisphere and to face the Equator; all are poleward of 30° latitude. A number of authors have suggested that their formation process involves liquid water, probably from melting ice, although others have argued for formation mechanisms involving carbon dioxide frost or the movement of dry dust. No partially degraded gullies have formed by weathering and no superimposed impact craters have been observed, indicating that these are young features, possibly still active. Other geological features, such as deltas and alluvial fans preserved in craters, are further evidence for warmer, wetter conditions at an interval or intervals in earlier Mars history. Such conditions necessarily require the widespread presence of crater lakes across {{a large proportion of the}} surface, for which there is independent mineralogical, sedimentological and geomorphological evidence.|$|E
5|$|US730 {{begins at}} a partial {{cloverleaf}} interchange with I-84 and US30 at Boardman Junction, located {{east of the}} city of Boardman in Morrow County. The highway, a continuation of Columbia River Highway No. 2, travels northeast across a Union Pacific rail line and passes the Umatilla National Wildlife Refuge on the Columbia River before reaching the city of Irrigon. From Irrigon, US730 continues northeast along the Columbia River into Umatilla County and becomes 6th Street in the city of Umatilla. The highway intersects I-82 and US395 in a diamond interchange and forms a short concurrency with US395. US730 continues east through the unincorporated community of McNary and the northern terminus of Oregon Route207 (OR207) in rural Umatilla County. The highway turns northeastward along Lake Wallula and intersects OR37 at Cold Springs Junction, providing connections north to the Warehouse Beach Recreation Area and Hat Rock State Park on the Columbia River and south to the city of Pendleton. US730 heads into Washington, traveling between a Union Pacific rail line and the <b>canyon</b> <b>walls</b> of the Columbia River Gorge. An ODOT survey measuring traffic volume for any average day of the year, expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), was conducted in 2011 on US730 and calculated that the busiest section of the highway in Oregon was at its interchange with I-82, serving 11,800 vehicles, while the least busy section of the highway was at the Washington state line, serving 2,500 vehicles.|$|E

25|$|The Ancestral Pueblo people {{crafted a}} unique {{architecture}} with planned community spaces. The ancient population centers such as Chaco Canyon (outside Crownpoint, New Mexico), Mesa Verde (near Cortez, Colorado), and Bandelier National Monument (near Los Alamos, New Mexico) have brought renown to the Ancestral Pueblo peoples. They consisted of apartment-like complexes and structures made from stone, adobe mud, {{and other local}} material, or were carved into the sides of <b>canyon</b> <b>walls.</b> Developed within these cultures, the people also adopted design details from other cultures {{as far away as}} contemporary Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Falsework {{centering}} (in British English: arch frame) is fabricated, typically from timbers and boards. Since each arch of a multi-arch bridge will {{impose a}} thrust upon its neighbors, {{it is necessary}} either that all arches of the bridge be raised at the same time, or that very wide piers be used. The thrust from the end arches is taken into the earth by substantial (vertical) footings at the <b>canyon</b> <b>walls,</b> or by large inclined planes forming in a sense ramps to the bridge, which may also be formed of arches.|$|E

25|$|The {{downtown}} {{core and}} {{much of the rest of}} Billings is in the Yellowstone Valley which is a canyon carved out by the Yellowstone River. Around 80 million years ago, the Billings area was on the shore of the Western Interior Seaway. The sea deposited sediment and sand around the shoreline. As the sea retreated it left behind a deep layer of sand. Over millions of years this sand was compressed into stone that is known as Eagle Sandstone. Over the last million years the river has carved its way down through this stone to form the <b>canyon</b> <b>walls</b> that are known as the Billings Rimrocks or the Rims.|$|E
25|$|The Colonial Route {{is mostly}} in the central {{highlands}} with {{a significant number of}} churches, monasteries and other structures from the colonial period along with some from the 19th century and even into the early 20th. The most important city on this route is San Cristóbal de las Casas, located in the Los Altos region in the Jovel Valley. The historic center of the city is filled with tiled roofs, patios with flowers, balconies, Baroque facades along with Neoclassical and Moorish designs. It is centered on a main plaza surrounded by the cathedral, the municipal palace, the Portales commercial area and the San Nicolás church. In addition, it has museums dedicated to the state’s indigenous cultures, one to amber and one to jade, both of which have been mined in the state. Other attractions along this route include Comitán de Domínguez and Chiapa de Corzo, along with small indigenous communities such as San Juan Chamula. The state capital of Tuxtla Gutiérrez does not have many colonial era structures left, but it lies near the area's most famous natural attraction of the Sumidero Canyon. This canyon is popular with tourists who take boat tours into it on the Grijalva River to see such features such as caves (La Cueva del Hombre, La Cueva del Silencio) and the Christmas Tree, which is a rock and plant formation on the side of one of the <b>canyon</b> <b>walls</b> created by a seasonal waterfall.|$|E
25|$|By the 1850s the Fraser Canyon was {{transformed}} from a First Nations and fur trade corridor to a busy route, called the Cariboo Road, used by gold rush miners seeking access to the upper Fraser Basin. During the 1880s, the Canadian Pacific Railway built a new transcontinental railroad to unite the far-flung provinces of the young Dominion of Canada. This nation-building project saw new railroad tracks constructed on the west riverbank at Hells Gate, connecting the British Columbia coast to the Interior (and the rest of Canada) through the Fraser Canyon. Some assert that rocks and debris dumped into the river during construction of the CPR constricted the river flow and impeded salmon passage, {{though there is no}} documented historical or physical evidence to support this claim. By early 1911 the Canadian Northern Railway began a second transcontinental railway along the south and east bank of the canyon, which was completed in a year's time. While carving into <b>canyon</b> <b>walls</b> to create new rail-bed, rock and debris were again dumped into the river in significant volumes at various locations, including Hells Gate. In early 1914, two years after the completion of the CNR and during construction of a new tunnel, a large rockslide fell into the river just above the Hells Gate portal. Debris dispersed on the river bottom caused a 5-meter vertical drop in water depth and increased water velocity from five meters per second to 6.75m/second. As observed and noted by local residents and later by biologists {{in the aftermath of the}} slide, noticeably higher water velocity seemed to exceed the swimming capacity of the salmon, resulting in premature mortality and reduced populations of salmon fry in the subsequent year. In an initial attempt to redress the ecological and physical changes at Hells Gate that impeded migrating salmon, tons of rocks and debris were removed from the river during the winter of 1914-1915. By early 1915, Hells Gate was pronounced clear. While government officials declared that the river at Hells Gate was fully restored, many biologists maintain that the slide permanently altered the river's ecology.|$|E
