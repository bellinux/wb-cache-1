5|$|Both iron(III) {{chloride}} and PAC {{are used}} as flocculation and <b>coagulation</b> agents in sewage treatment, drinking water production, and paper production.|$|E
5|$|The swollen, {{inflamed}} muscle may directly compress {{structures in}} the same fascial compartment, causing compartment syndrome. The swelling may also further compromise blood supply into the area. Finally, destroyed muscle cells release potassium ions, phosphate ions, the heme-containing protein myoglobin, the enzyme creatine kinase and uric acid (a breakdown product of purines from DNA) into the blood. Activation of the <b>coagulation</b> system may precipitate disseminated intravascular <b>coagulation.</b> High potassium levels may lead to potentially fatal disruptions in heart rhythm. Phosphate binds to calcium from the circulation, leading to low calcium levels in the blood.|$|E
5|$|Disseminated {{intravascular}} <b>coagulation</b> generally resolves {{when the}} underlying causes are treated, but supportive measures are often required. For instance, if the platelet count drops significantly and there is resultant bleeding, platelets may be administered.|$|E
5|$|Disseminated {{intravascular}} <b>coagulation,</b> another {{complication of}} rhabdomyolysis {{and other forms}} of critical illness, may be suspected on the basis of unexpected bleeding or abnormalities in hematological tests, such as a decreasing platelet count or prolongation of the prothrombin time. The diagnosis can be confirmed with standard blood tests for DIC, such as D-dimer.|$|E
5|$|Normal <b>coagulation</b> is {{initiated}} by the release of tissue factor from damaged tissue. Tissue factor binds to circulating factor VIIa. The combination activates factor X to factor Xa and factor IX to factor IXa. Factor Xa (in the presence of factor V) activates prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin is a central enzyme in the <b>coagulation</b> process: it generates fibrin from fibrinogen, and activates {{a number of other}} enzymes and cofactors (factor XIII, factor XI, factor V and factor VIII, TAFI) that enhance the fibrin clot. The process is inhibited by TFPI (which inactivates the first step catalyzed by factor VIIa/tissue factor), antithrombin (which inactivates thrombin, factor IXa, Xa and XIa), protein C (which inhibits factors Va and VIIIa in the presence of protein S), and protein Z (which inhibits factor Xa).|$|E
5|$|Obesity {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as {{a risk factor for}} venous thrombosis. It more than doubles the risk in numerous studies, particularly in combination with the use of oral contraceptives or in the period after surgery. Various <b>coagulation</b> abnormalities have been described in the obese. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, is present in higher levels in people with obesity. Obese people also have larger numbers of circulating microvesicles (fragments of damaged cells) that bear tissue factor. Platelet aggregation may be increased, and there are higher levels of <b>coagulation</b> proteins such as von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, factor VII and factor VIII. Obesity also increases the risk of recurrence after an initial episode of thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of cases (60–80%) are not precipitated by a particular cause. A quarter {{has a history of}} high blood pressure, but this is a common problem in the general population, and {{it is not clear whether}} it significantly increase the risk of apoplexy. A number of cases has been reported in association with particular conditions and situations; it is uncertain whether these were in fact causative. Amongst reported associations are surgery (especially coronary artery bypass graft, where there are significant fluctuations in the blood pressure), disturbances in blood <b>coagulation</b> or medication that inhibits <b>coagulation,</b> radiation therapy to the pituitary, traumatic brain injury, pregnancy (during which the pituitary enlarges) and treatment with estrogens. Hormonal stimulation tests of the pituitary have been reported to provoke episodes. Treatment of prolactinomas (pituitary adenomas that secrete prolactin) with dopamine agonist drugs, as well as withdrawal of such treatment, has been reported to precipitate apoplexy.|$|E
5|$|These {{tests are}} useful {{in a range of}} medical specialisms, {{including}} infectious disease, oncology, human leucocyte antigen typing (which investigates and predicts immune function), <b>coagulation,</b> and pharmacogenomicsthe genetic prediction of which drugs will work best. They overlap with clinical chemistry (medical tests on bodily fluids).|$|E
5|$|About 5% of {{all people}} are {{diagnosed}} only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often {{in the context of}} a hemolytic anemia (anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells). This leads to abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged <b>coagulation)</b> and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, the person develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening swelling of the brain).|$|E
5|$|According to {{the solar}} nebular disk model, rocky planets {{form in the}} inner part of the protoplanetary disk, within the frost line, where the {{temperature}} is high enough to prevent condensation of water ice and other substances into grains. This results in <b>coagulation</b> of purely rocky grains {{and later in the}} formation of rocky planetesimals. Such conditions are thought to exist in the inner 3–4AU part of the disk of a Sun-like star.|$|E
5|$|Any {{blood clot}} forms {{due to an}} {{imbalance}} between <b>coagulation</b> (the formation of the insoluble blood protein fibrin) and fibrinolysis. The three major mechanisms for such an imbalance are enumerated in Virchow's triad: alterations in normal blood flow, injury to the blood vessel wall, and alterations in the constitution of blood (hypercoagulability). Most cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are due to hypercoagulability.|$|E
5|$|Cancer, {{particularly}} when metastatic (spread {{to other places}} in the body), is a recognised risk factor for thrombosis. A number of mechanisms have been proposed, such as activation of the <b>coagulation</b> system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances. Furthermore, particular cancer treatments (such as the use of central venous catheters for chemotherapy) may increase the risk of thrombosis further.|$|E
5|$|Clinical or {{biochemical}} {{evidence of}} liver toxicity may develop in {{one to four}} days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12hours. Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated AST, ALT, bilirubin, and prolonged <b>coagulation</b> times, particularly an elevated prothrombin time. After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed. In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000IU/L.|$|E
5|$|Dust {{particles}} tend {{to stick}} {{to each other in}} the dense disk environment, leading to the formation of larger particles up to several centimeters in size. The signatures of the dust processing and <b>coagulation</b> are observed in the infrared spectra of the young disks. Further aggregation can lead to the formation of planetesimals measuring 1km across or larger, which are the building blocks of planets. Planetesimal formation is another unsolved problem of disk physics, as simple sticking becomes ineffective as dust particles grow larger.|$|E
5|$|Holmium-chromium-thulium triple-doped Yttrium {{aluminum}} garnet (Ho:Cr:Tm:YAG, or Ho,Cr,Tm:YAG) is {{an active}} laser medium material with high efficiency. It lases at 2097nm and is widely used in military applications, medicine, and meteorology. Single-element thulium-doped YAG (Tm:YAG) lasers operate between 1930 and 2040nm. The wavelength of thulium-based lasers is very efficient for superficial ablation of tissue, with minimal <b>coagulation</b> depth in air or in water. This makes thulium lasers attractive for laser-based surgery.|$|E
5|$|In the early, or {{fulminating}} form, hemorrhaging {{appears on}} {{the second or third}} day as sub-conjunctival bleeding turns the whites of the eyes deep red. Hemorrhagic smallpox also produces a dusky erythema, petechiae, and hemorrhages in the spleen, kidney, serosa, muscle, and, rarely, the epicardium, liver, testes, ovaries and bladder. Death often occurs suddenly between the fifth and seventh days of illness, when only a few insignificant skin lesions are present. A later form of the disease occurs in patients who survive for 8–10 days. The hemorrhages appear in the early eruptive period, and the rash is flat and does not progress beyond the vesicular stage. Patients in the early stage of disease show a decrease in <b>coagulation</b> factors (e.g. platelets, prothrombin, and globulin) and an increase in circulating antithrombin. Patients in the late stage have significant thrombocytopenia; however, deficiency of <b>coagulation</b> factors is less severe. Some in the late stage also show increased antithrombin. This form of smallpox occurs in anywhere from 3 to 25 percent of fatal cases depending on the virulence of the smallpox strain. Hemorrhagic smallpox is usually fatal.|$|E
5|$|Other {{blood tests}} are often taken to help {{understand}} a person's general health and risk {{factors that may}} contribute to heart disease. These often include a full blood count investigating for anaemia, and basic metabolic panel that may reveal any disturbances in electrolytes. A <b>coagulation</b> screen is often required {{to ensure that the}} right level of anticoagulation is given. Fasting lipids and fasting blood glucose (or an HbA1c level) are often ordered to evaluate a person's cholesterol and diabetes status, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Poisoning {{symptoms}} are rapid in onset, consisting initially of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and associated decreased blood volume. Shortly after these initial symptoms appear, hemolysis develops, resulting in reduced urine output, hemoglobin {{in the urine}} or outright absence of urine formation, and anemia. Medical laboratory tests consist of testing {{for the presence of}} increasing bilirubin and free hemoglobin, and falling haptoglobins. Hemolysis may lead to numerous complications including acute renal failure, shock, acute respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular <b>coagulation.</b> These complications can cause significant morbidity with fatalities having been reported.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary care {{consists}} of gastric decontamination with either activated carbon or gastric lavage. However, {{due to the}} delay between ingestion and the first symptoms of poisoning, it is commonplace for patients to arrive for treatment long after ingestion, potentially reducing the efficacy of these interventions. Supportive measures are directed towards treating the dehydration which results from fluid loss during the gastrointestinal phase of intoxication and correction of metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, and impaired <b>coagulation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ryan White {{was born}} at St. Joseph Memorial Hospital in Kokomo, Indiana, to Hubert Wayne and Jeanne Elaine (Hale) White. When he was circumcised, the {{bleeding}} would not stop. When he was three days old, doctors diagnosed him with severe hemophilia A, a hereditary blood <b>coagulation</b> disorder associated with the X chromosome, which causes even minor injuries to result in severe bleeding. For treatment, he received weekly infusions of Factor VIII, a blood product created from pooled plasma of non-hemophiliacs, an increasingly common treatment for hemophiliacs at the time.|$|E
5|$|Swelling of damaged muscle {{occasionally}} {{leads to}} compartment syndrome—compression of surrounding tissues, such as nerves and blood vessels, {{in the same}} fascial compartment—leading {{to the loss of}} blood supply and damage or loss of function in the part(s) of the body supplied by these structures. Symptoms of this complication include pain or reduced sensation in the affected limb. A second recognized complication is disseminated intravascular <b>coagulation</b> (DIC), a severe disruption in blood clotting that may lead to uncontrollable bleeding.|$|E
5|$|The German-speaking {{scientists}} who isolated and described vitaminK (in addition to naming it as such) {{did so because}} the vitamin is intimately involved in the <b>coagulation</b> of blood following wounding (from the German word Koagulation). At the time, most (but not all) of the letters from F through to J were already designated, so {{the use of the}} letter K was considered quite reasonable. The table nomenclature of reclassified vitamins lists chemicals that had previously been classified as vitamins, as well as the earlier names of vitamins that later became part of the B-complex.|$|E
5|$|The M3 subtype of AML, {{also known}} as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), is almost universally treated with the drug all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in {{addition}} to induction chemotherapy, usually an anthracycline. Care {{must be taken to}} prevent disseminated intravascular <b>coagulation</b> (DIC), complicating the treatment of APL when the promyelocytes release the contents of their granules into the peripheral circulation. APL is eminently curable, with well-documented treatment protocols.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is {{large quantities of}} intravenous fluids. Other treatments may include dialysis or hemofiltration in more severe cases. Once urine output is established sodium bicarbonate and mannitol are commonly used but they are poorly supported by the evidence. Outcomes are generally good if treated early. Complications may include high blood potassium, low blood calcium, disseminated intravascular <b>coagulation,</b> and compartment syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The {{third phase}} follows at 3 to 5 days, and {{is marked by}} {{complications}} of massive liver necrosis leading to fulminant liver failure with complications of <b>coagulation</b> defects, low blood sugar, kidney failure, hepatic encephalopathy, brain swelling, sepsis, multiple organ failure, and death. If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and kidney function typically return to normal in a few weeks. The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.|$|E
5|$|Thrombophilia (sometimes {{hypercoagulability}} or a prothrombotic state) is an abnormality {{of blood}} <b>coagulation</b> {{that increases the}} risk of thrombosis (blood clots in blood vessels). Such abnormalities can be identified in 50% of people who have an episode of thrombosis (such as deep vein thrombosis in the leg) that was not provoked by other causes. A significant proportion of the population has a detectable abnormality, but most of these only develop thrombosis in the presence of an additional risk factor.|$|E
5|$|A rare but serious {{complication}} {{resulting from}} treatment with warfarin is warfarin necrosis, which occurs more frequently shortly after commencing treatment {{in patients with}} a deficiency of protein C. Protein C is an innate anticoagulant that, like the procoagulant factors that warfarin inhibits, requires vitamin K-dependent carboxylation for its activity. Since warfarin initially decreases protein C levels faster than the <b>coagulation</b> factors, it can paradoxically increase the blood's tendency to coagulate when treatment is first begun (many patients when starting on warfarin are given heparin in parallel to combat this), leading to massive thrombosis with skin necrosis and gangrene of limbs. Its natural counterpart, purpura fulminans, occurs in children who are homozygous for certain protein C mutations.|$|E
5|$|Another {{study has}} implicated EFS in the Chediak-Higashi {{syndrome}} (CHS). This rare and severe autosomal recessive disorder associated with partial albinism, peripheral neuropathy, mild <b>coagulation</b> defects and propensity to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, caused by incomplete phagocytosis due to failure in phagolysosome formation. This work identified a direct interaction in vitro and in vivo between EFS and LYST (lysosomal trafficking regulator, aka CHS1 - Chediak-Higashi syndrome 1), a large protein that regulates the intracellular trafficking of proteins through endosomes that is mutated in CHS. These results may imply {{the role of}} EFS as a disease progression modifier, although further testing and establishment of mechanism is necessary.|$|E
5|$|Anticoagulation, which {{prevents}} further <b>coagulation,</b> {{but does not}} act directly on existing clots, is the standard treatment for DVT. Balancing risk vs. benefit is important in determining the duration of anticoagulation, and three months is generally the standard length of treatment. In those with an annual risk of VTE in excess of 9%, as after an unprovoked episode, extended anticoagulation is a possibility. Those who finish VKA treatment after idiopathic VTE with an elevated D-dimer level show {{an increased risk of}} recurrent VTE (about 9% vs about 4% for normal results), and this result might be used in clinical decision-making. Thrombophilia test results rarely {{play a role in the}} length of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Arafat was {{pronounced}} dead at 03:30UTC on 11 November 2004 {{at the age of}} 75 of what French doctors called a massive hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (hemorrhagic stroke). Initially, Arafat's medical records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials, and Arafat's wife refused an autopsy. French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular <b>coagulation,</b> although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, the Palestinian people went into a state of mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and tires burned in the streets. The Palestinian Authority and refugee camps in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning.|$|E
5|$|In humans, bites {{from this}} species can produce severe local and {{systemic}} symptoms. Based {{on the degree}} and type of local effect, bites {{can be divided into}} two symptomatic categories: those with little or no surface extravasation, and those with hemorrhages evident as ecchymosis, bleeding and swelling. In both cases there is severe pain and tenderness, but in the latter there is widespread superficial or deep necrosis and compartment syndrome. Serious bites cause limbs to become immovably flexed as a result of significant hemorrhage or <b>coagulation</b> in the affected muscles. Residual induration, however, is rare and usually these areas completely resolve.|$|E
5|$|Protease {{inhibition}} by serpins controls {{an array}} of biological processes, including <b>coagulation</b> and inflammation, and consequently these proteins are the target of medical research. Their unique conformational change also makes them {{of interest to the}} structural biology and protein folding research communities. The conformational-change mechanism confers certain advantages, but it also has drawbacks: serpins are vulnerable to mutations that can result in serpinopathies such as protein misfolding and the formation of inactive long-chain polymers. Serpin polymerisation not only reduces the amount of active inhibitor, but also leads to accumulation of the polymers, causing cell death and organ failure.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{disease is}} marked by the {{problems}} of capillary permeability (an allowance of fluid and protein normally contained within blood to pass) and disordered blood clotting. These changes appear associated with a disordered state of the endothelial glycocalyx, which acts as a molecular filter of blood components. Leaky capillaries (and the critical phase) {{are thought to be}} caused by an immune system response. Other processes of interest include infected cells that become necrotic—which affect both <b>coagulation</b> and fibrinolysis (the opposing systems of blood clotting and clot degradation)—and low platelets in the blood, also a factor in normal clotting.|$|E
5|$|With {{regards to}} {{digestive}} tract lesions, mild bleeding and mild resultant anemia is treated with iron supplementation, and no specific treatment is administered. There is limited data on hormone treatment and tranexamic acid to reduce bleeding and anemia. Severe anemia or episodes of severe bleeding {{are treated with}} endoscopic argon plasma <b>coagulation</b> (APC) or laser treatment of any lesions identified; this may {{reduce the need for}} supportive treatment. The expected benefits are not such that repeated attempts at treating lesions are advocated. Sudden, very severe bleeding is unusual—if encountered, alternative causes (such as a peptic ulcer) need to be considered—but embolization may be used in such instances.|$|E
25|$|The <b>coagulation</b> system {{overlaps}} with the immune system. <b>Coagulation</b> can physically trap invading microbes in blood clots. Also, some {{products of the}} <b>coagulation</b> system {{can contribute to the}} innate immune system by their ability to increase vascular permeability and act as chemotactic agents for phagocytic cells. In addition, some of the products of the <b>coagulation</b> system are directly antimicrobial. For example, beta-lysine, an amino acid produced by platelets during <b>coagulation,</b> can cause lysis of many Gram-positive bacteria by acting as a cationic detergent. Many acute-phase proteins of inflammation are involved in the <b>coagulation</b> system. In addition, pathogenic bacteria may secrete agents that alter the <b>coagulation</b> system, e.g. coagulase and streptokinase.|$|E
