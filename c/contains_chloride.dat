There is a possibility to discern hyperchloremia caused by intravenous fluid use from many other causes by considering the relationship between sodium and chloride rather than treating the latter as a separate entity. The physicochemical approach introduced by the late Peter Stewart argues that the difference between strong cations and anions, by definition fully dissociated in human plasma, is one of the three independent determinants of pH [12]. This entity, termed strong ion difference or (SID), is reduced when hyperchloremia exists without an equal increase in sodium, e.g., after the intravenous administration of NaCl 0.9  %. Knowledge of the clinical impact of (SID) could contribute to the complex debate on the use of balanced solutions whose purpose is to prevent hyperchloremia and/or metabolic acidosis caused by a reduction in (SID). At this moment, despite being a well-known and independent cause of metabolic acidosis, the relevance of a decreased (SID) is doubted [13, 14].|$|E

A feasibility study, completed in 1976, after six wells had been drilled and tested, indicated that development of the Olkaria field was feasible.

The first unit was brought on stream in July 1981, the second in December, 1982, and the third is scheduled to be completed in early 1985. The current output of 19 productive wells is equivalent to 46 MWe.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effects of}} stray currents on durability and reinforcement corrosion of underground concrete structures. Cathodic protection of underground pipelines are stationary sources of stray current interference with concrete, and rail traction systems are non-stationary sources. The soil is the electrolyte that conducts stray current to the concrete structure and absorbs current from it. The current passes through the concrete cover at entry points (cathodes), via the reinforcement and again through the cover at exit points (anodes). Polarization of steel occurs at these points. Anodic polarization can break down the normal passivation of steel in concrete and initiate corrosion. A quantitative model for this mechanism is proposed. An empirical relationship was derived from literature data relating the time to initiation of corrosion to the anodic current density and the chloride content of the concrete. At chloride contents below 0. 4 % by mass of cement, corrosion may be initiated {{in a year or}} less by exit currents of 1 A/m 2 or higher. At chloride contents of 0. 4 % or higher, the initiation time for 1 A/m 2 is short (days). For lower current densities, extrapolating from the experimental results is necessary. The distribution of current between concrete elements and soil can be calculated from geometrical considerations and their resistivities. Inside the concrete, the cathodic steel surface may be larger than the anodic surface. The cathode/anode ratio constitutes a concentration factor which may be between 1 and 100. If the soil <b>contains</b> <b>chloride</b> ions, migration of chloride into the concrete at anodic sites may further reduce the time to initiation of corrosion. The empirical model was applied to a bored tunnel lining segment. Critical (cathodic) stray current densities were calculated for a (mean) initiation time of 100 years, depending on the initial chloride content. The time between initiation of corrosion and cracking of concrete is relatively short (days). The time to complete dissolution of reinforcing bars may be as short as days for high stray current densities or as long as decades for low current densities. The results indicate that stray current interference is significant with regard to durability of underground concrete structures and should be further studie...|$|E
40|$|Geopolymer {{material}} using by-products {{can lead}} to a significant reduction of the carbon footprint and have positive impact on the environment. Geopolymer is recognized as an alternative construction material for the Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) concrete. The mechanical properties of geopolymer concrete are superior for normal exposure environments. In terms of durability in the seawater, a limited number of publications were available. The seawater environment <b>contains</b> <b>chloride</b> ions and microorganisms that are harmful for reinforced concrete structures. Hence, a study of the durability of fly ash geopolymer concrete is essential when this material is to be used in a real application. The present study aims to investigate the durability of fly ash geopolymer concrete mixture in a seawater environment such as seawater resistance and corrosion of steel reinforcement bars. The development of mixtures and their mechanical properties were also presented. The concrete mixtures were developed using the Taguchi optimization method. Three mixtures, labelled T 4, T 7, T 10 and a control mix were investigated further. Mechanical properties such as compressive strength, tensile strength, flexural strength, Young’s Modulus of Elasticity were determined for each mix. In addition the water absorption/AVPV and drying shrinkage were also measured. The seawater resistance study comprises chloride ion penetration, change in strength, change in mass, change in Young’s Modulus of Elasticity, change in effective porosity and change in length. The corrosion performance of steel reinforcement bars in fly ash geopolymer concrete was determined by measuring the corrosion potential by half-cell potential, accelerated corrosion test by impressed voltage method and microbiologically influenced corrosion incorporating algae. The microstructure of the samples was also investigated using SEM and microscope. It can be summarized that the fly ash geopolymer concrete has an equivalent or higher strength than the OPC concrete. The seawater resistance revealed a high chloride ion penetration into the fly ash geopolymer concrete due to lack of a chloride binding ability and continuous hydration under aqueous medium. The geopolymer concrete had a higher strength and small expansion following exposure to wetting-drying cycles. There was a rapid depassivation of steel reinforcement bars in fly ash geopolymer concrete, although it has a smaller corrosion rate than the OPC concrete. This could delay the pressure in generating cracks in the concrete cover which is not favourable in the long term, due to a sudden loss of load carrying capacity. A novel study on the corrosion performance in algae medium demonstrated a risk of steel bar corrosion in fly ash geopolymer concrete due to the low alkalinity of this concrete. It can be concluded that the low calcium fly ash geopolymer offers some advantages in durability for reinforced concrete in seawater environments...|$|E
