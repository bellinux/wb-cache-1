50|$|The United States, which {{aimed at}} a {{complete}} exemption of non-contraband private property from <b>capture</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> withheld its formal adherence in 1857 when its “Marcy” amendment was not accepted by all powers, chiefly {{as a result of}} British influence. The US was also keen on maintaining privateers. It argued that, not possessing a great navy, it would be obliged in time of war to rely largely upon merchant ships commissioned as war vessels, and that therefore the abolition of privateering would be entirely in favour of European powers, whose large navies rendered them practically independent of such aid. All other maritime states acceded to the declaration except Venezuela and Bolivia.|$|E

The future Admiral John Surman Carden was a member of Smith's crew from 1787 to 1793, before his transfer to the HMS Marlborough. As captain of Perseverance, Smith was assigned to the East Indies Station under the overall command of Admiral William Cornwallis and took part in the <b>capture</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> of the French frigate Résolue in 1791 at the Battle of Tellicherry, shortly before the outbreak of the first French Revolutionary War.|$|E

There {{were a number of}} {{unilateral}} and bilateral declarations limiting privateering between 1785 and 1823. However, the breakthrough came in 1856 when the Declaration of Paris, signed by all major European powers, stated that [...] "Privateering is and remains abolished". The US did not sign because a stronger amendment, protecting all private property from <b>capture</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> was not accepted. In the 19th century many nations passed laws forbidding their nationals from accepting commissions as privateers for other nations. The last major power to flirt with privateering was Prussia in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War, when Prussia announced the creation of a 'volunteer navy' of ships privately owned and manned and eligible for prize money. The only difference between this and privateering was that these volunteer ships were under the discipline of the regular navy.|$|E

5000|$|Edmund Magauran's {{value as}} an {{emissary}} from Catholic Europe to the Irish chiefs was recognised by Pope Gregory XIII. who rewarded {{him with a}} bishopric. Magauran was praeconised in the Papal Consistory of 2 September 1581 and on 11 September 1581 he was appointed Bishop of Ardagh, a diocese adjacent to Kilmore. The Consistorial Act states- [...] "Die 11 Sept., 1581, referente Senonen. Providit ecc. Ardachaden, in Hib. vac., per trans. Reverendissimus Pater Dominus Richardi ad ecc. Kilmoren., de persona Edmundi Macsaruraghan, ipsumque etc." [...] Bishop Magauran was neither the first nor last Kilmore priest to hold this bishopric as his immediate predecessor Richard Brady O.F.M., a Franciscan from Cavan, ruled Ardagh from 1576 to 1580 when he {{was transferred to the}} See of Kilmore. Furthermore a namesake of Edmund's, Cormac Mác Shamhradháin, the Prior of Drumlane Abbey, was Bishop of Ardagh from 1444 to 1476, while another namesake James Magauran was parish priest of Oughteragh in Kilmore diocese before he ruled as Bishop of Ardagh from 1815 to 1829. As Edmund Magauran was only aged about 34 {{at the time of his}} appointment, he must have been highly regarded by his superiors. Pope Gregory XIII later proved this by entrusting Bishop Magauran with a special mission to the Ulster Gaelic chiefs, when he was to attempt to obtain their support for the Geraldine war or Desmond Rebellions (1579-83), which was then raging in Munster. It is regarded as the first Counter-Reformation military crusade in Ireland. Following the reduction of Desmond, MacGauran was exiled from Ireland in 1585 by Queen Elizabeth I of England and he went first to Scotland with some trusty servants. In the summer of 1585 Magauran travelled around Scotland and claimed to have confirmed upwards of 10,000 Scottish Catholics. The English government was afraid Magauran was trying to start a joint uprising in both Scotland and Ireland to overthrow the Protestant religion, so at the request of Queen Elizabeth, the Scottish government issued orders for his arrest but he evaded them by boarding a ship bound for France in September 1585. On the way the ship was captured by Sir Francis Drake on 7 September 1585 and taken to London. However Magauran and his companions were concealed in a hideout in the bottom of the ship and escaped detection when it was searched. The bishop then boarded another ship for France which was attacked by pirates. However they escaped and landed in France where they made their way to Paris, arriving shortly before 31 September 1585. Father James Tyrie, a Jesuit priest in Paris, wrote a letter to Fr. Claudio Acquaviva, the Superior-General of the Jesuits in Rome on 31 September, stating- [...] "We have had a visit from an Irish Bishop, who has been some time in Scotland, and with Fathers Hay and Gordon. He was entrusted by them with letters, which he eventually threw into the sea when in peril from enemies. From letters by Robert Bruce and others, I extract these particulars. Fathers Hay and Gordon are in the North of Scotland with the Earl of Huntly; Fathers Holt and Dury are in the West with the Earl of Morton i.e., Lord Maxwell at Dumfries. The number of Catholics increases rapidly every day, and the Irish Bishop assures me that during the short time he remained in Scotland, he administered the sacrament of confirmation to at least ten thousand persons." [...] Corroboration of this event is provided by a later report in the same year which suggested that the same number of souls had been reconciled to Catholicism in the previous six months. Bishop Magauran then left France for Spain. The Lord Deputy, Sir John Perrot writing from Dublin on 12 January 1586 to Sir Francis Walsingham, stated- [...] "Sir Cuconnaught Maguire is at this present with me here, and telleth me that the Pope's bishop of Ardagh, maintained by O'Rourke, went this last summer to Scotland, and thence to France and thence to Spain, did assure him that Spaniards would land this Spring, either in the west or in the north or in both places, but he durst not deliver this matter to any other but to myself. It was that bishop which Brian McGeoghegan told Captain Nicholas Dawtrey of."In 1586 Magauran left Spain for Rome. On entering Italy he first went on a pilgrimage to the Marian Shrine at Loreto, Marche on foot to fulfill a double vow he made when saved from <b>capture</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b> Loreto is a hilltown and comune of the Italian province of Ancona, in the Marche. It is mostly famous as the seat of the Basilica della Santa Casa, a popular Catholic pilgrimage site and it was the foremost Marian Shrine in Europe at that time. The reason Bishop Magauran gave for this pilgrimage to Loreto was that his escape from Drake's search happened on the eve of the birthday of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who had warned one of his companions in a dream. Magauran spent three days at Loreto and left the above account of his adventures in the shrine. He reached Rome before 25 April 1586 as on that date we find him acting as one of the principal co-consecrators of Maol Muire Ó hÚigínn, the new Archbishop of Tuam. Following this visit to Rome he returned to Spain to continue his efforts to extract help with the Counter-Reformation movement in Ireland from King Philip II of Spain. The King selected Magauran to perform the consecration ceremony for the new basilica at El Escorial on 10 August 1586 so he must have been held in high regard. In Spain he associated with the Geraldine exiles from Lisbon such as Maurice Fitzgerald, Edmund Eustace, Charles O'Conor-Faly, and Bishop Cornelius O'Mulrian of Killaloe.|$|E

40|$|Four {{species of}} sea terns in the genus Sterna were studied {{primarily}} {{to determine how}} they differed in strategies used to exploit available food, and to identify factors that influenced their success in obtaining it. Where the four species coexisted during the breeding season, interspecific {{differences were found in}} feeding dispersion, dive height, immersion time, use of 'contact-dipping' and size of prey taken. These variations should alleviate competition for food, and therefore facilitate coexistence. The food-robbing behaviour exhibited by Roseate Terns on Coquet Island was examined. The intensity and success of attacks were correlated with the density of "host" terns. Fish size affected the likelihood of attack, and of robbing success. Several variables were found to influence rates of fish <b>capture</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b> Feeding rates contained both diurnal and tidal patterns, the latter corresponding with tidal variations in the rate of fish capture in the littoral zone. In Africa, first-winter Sandwich Terns were less successful than older birds at catching fish, suggesting that foraging skill is acquired gradually. An assessment of weather factors influencing fishing success, and growth rates of chicks indicated that windspeed and/or sea surface disturbance increase to levels that optimise fishing ability of inshore-feeding terns, after which their effects become detrimental. The inimical effects of paralytic shellfish poisoning on the breeding success of terns in 1968 are described. Analysis of the composition of tern eggs demonstrated significant differences between the terminal egg and the prior egg(s) of any laying sequence. The adaptedness of terns to a variable food supply is discussed with reference to other predator-prey systems. Hypotheses for the causation and function of deferred maturity in birds and other animals are assessed in relation to the slow acquisition of foraging skills by Sandwich Terns and some other seabirds...|$|E
