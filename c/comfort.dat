5|$|Cameron and <b>Comfort</b> {{participated in}} a {{televised}} debate with atheists Brian Sapient and Kelly O'Conner of the Rational Response Squad, at Calvary Baptist Church, in Manhattan, on May 5, 2007. It was moderated by ABC's Martin Bashir and parts of it were aired on Nightline. At issue was the existence of God, which <b>Comfort</b> stated he could prove scientifically, without relying on faith or the Bible. The audience was composed of both theists and atheists. Points of discussion included atheism and evolution. While Sapient contended during his arguments that <b>Comfort</b> violated the rules by talking about the Ten Commandments, Cameron later stated on The Way of the Master radio show that {{the rules of the}} debate did not say that the Bible could never be referenced, but rather that <b>Comfort</b> simply {{had to come up with}} one argument that did not reference the Bible or faith.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine patients' {{attitudes to}} <b>comforting</b> touch in family practice. DESIGN: A survey was {{designed}} with statements {{and responses to}} proposed scenarios. SETTING: Twenty family practices throughout Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Family practice patients; of 400 surveys distributed, 376 were completed (94 % response rate). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients responded to scenarios on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Results were analyzed using SPSS for DOS. RESULTS: Most patients in this population believed that touch can be <b>comforting</b> (66. 3 %) and healing (57. 9 %). Women were more accepting of <b>comforting</b> touch than men in all scenarios. Acceptance of <b>comforting</b> touch declined for both sexes as touch became proximal and more intimate. Men and women were more accepting of <b>comforting</b> touch from female doctors. Acceptance of all <b>comforting</b> touch declined markedly if a physician was unfamiliar to a patient, regardless of the physician's sex. CONCLUSION: Most patients surveyed believed touch is <b>comforting</b> and healing and viewed distal touches (on the hand and shoulder) as <b>comforting...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we tested whether children’s play with {{feminine}} toys {{is related to}} social abilities in which girls typically excel. We measured gender-typed toy play, empathy, and <b>comforting</b> skill in 80 Grade 1 children (about 6 years-old) in Hong Kong, China. Toy play was assessed with a standard observational paradigm; empathy, with the Empathy Quotient-Child questionnaire; and <b>comforting</b> skill, with an infant-cry paradigm requiring the generation of <b>comforting</b> strategies. As predicted, boys and girls differed in their preferences for play with masculine and feminine toys, but not for gender-neutral toys. Importantly, toy play was related to <b>comforting</b> skill. Girls scored higher on the <b>comforting</b> task, and girls who played more with feminine toys and boys who played more with gender-neutral toys generated more <b>comforting</b> strategies. Regression and mediational analyses also suggested a stronger role of gender-typed play on <b>comforting</b> {{than the other way}} round. Contrary to hypothesis, there was no gender difference in empathy, and no relationship between empathy and toy play. These results extend previous understandings of the link between play and development and suggest that early gender-typed experiences may have long-term consequences for the development of some social skills...|$|R

40|$|<b>Comforting</b> {{touch is}} an {{integral}} aspect of nursing care. Health care providers touch can help patients to ease their descomfort. In the preent study, using surface electromyography, we investigated the effect of <b>comforting</b> touch on patient's feeling during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy without sedation. Twenty-seven patients, aged from 23 to 75 years, were informed of this study and consented to participate. During the examination, subjects were in supine position. Integrated electromyogram (IEMG) of sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles of 17 patients was recorded during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and <b>comforting</b> touch on their shoulder or arm (touch group) and of 10 patients during upper gastrintestinal endscopy (control group). IEMG was decreased by about 50 % in the touch group while very little change was observed in the control group. The {{difference between the two}} groups was statistically significant. Because the decrease in IEMG indicates relief of muscular strain induced by <b>comforting</b> touch, the results of this study suggest that <b>comforting</b> toush can relieve muscular strain during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The intended use of <b>comforting</b> touch should be emphasized in nursing education and staff development programs...|$|R
