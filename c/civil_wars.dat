5|$|The former Oxford University {{historian}} Adrian Goldsworthy {{has argued}} that the cause of the fall of the Roman Empire in the West should not be blamed on barbarization of the late Roman Army, but on its recurrent <b>civil</b> <b>wars,</b> which led to its ability to repel or defeat invasions from outside its frontiers to be seriously weakened. The East Roman or Byzantine empire on the other hand had fewer <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> to contend with in the late fourth and early fifth centuries, or in the years from 383-432 A.D.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} became {{worse for}} Byzantium during the <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> after Andronikos III died. A six-year-long civil war devastated the empire, allowing the Serbian ruler Stefan Dušan (r. 1331–1346) to overrun {{most of the}} Empire's remaining territory and establish a Serbian Empire. In 1354, an earthquake at Gallipoli devastated the fort, allowing the Ottomans (who were hired as mercenaries {{during the civil war}} by John VI Kantakouzenos) to establish themselves in Europe. By the time the Byzantine <b>civil</b> <b>wars</b> had ended, the Ottomans had defeated the Serbians and subjugated them as vassals.

5|$|During the British <b>Civil</b> <b>Wars</b> (mid-17th {{century in}} Great Britain), both the Parliamentarian and Royalist armies used various {{incendiary}} devices to attack enemies and destroy property {{that might be}} used for military purposes, according to historian Stephen Porter in Destruction in the English <b>Civil</b> <b>Wars.</b> The flaming arrow attack was used to set fire to buildings at a distance. An arrow with a flammable substance attached to the shaft, close to the tip, was shot from a bow or short-muzzled musket. Such arrows shot from a musket had their feathers removed, to fit inside the muzzle, and were called fire-darts. These devices were cheap to make and easy to prepare. Although used infrequently during the wars, the flaming arrows and darts proved to be destructive. The Royalists shot flaming arrows into the thatched homes {{in the suburbs of}} Chester causing extensive damage. Lyme Regis was partly razed using flaming arrows.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 16th century, the Lords was the {{stronger}} {{of the two}} houses of Parliament. A process of gradual developments combined with such moments of crisis as the English <b>Civil</b> <b>Wars</b> transferred the political control of England, first from the Crown to the House of Lords {{and then to the}} House of Commons. The rising wealth of the Commons eventually allowed it to wage two <b>civil</b> <b>wars,</b> dethrone two Kings, and gradually reduce the power of the Lords. Prior to the House of Lords Act 1999, the power of the Lords had been diminished by the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 which stripped the Lords of the ability to block, or veto, adoption of most bills; at most it could delay bills for one year. Furthermore, the Commons has absolute power when it comes to money bills.|$|E

40|$|This article {{draws on}} a {{comparative}} {{case study design}} to refine formal-quantitative models of <b>civil</b> <b>war,</b> expanding them to highlight political processes that lead to <b>civil</b> <b>war.</b> It uses 21 case studies of <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> onset and avoidance to show the shortcomings in prominent rationalist models of <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> that rely heavily on economic variables. These shortcomings include measurement error, unit heterogeneity, model misspecification, and lack of clarity about causal mechanisms. Additionally, the greed/grievance distinction that underlies the economic models is misguided. This article analyzes <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> not as a discrete phenomenon, but rather as one phase in a cycle of violence. Economic models of <b>civil</b> <b>war,</b> however, rely on theories that cannot distinguish effectively between <b>civil</b> <b>war</b> {{and other forms of}} political violence.

Bonville's son and grandson had been killed with the Duke of York and the Earl of Salisbury at the Battle of Wakefield in December 1460, and Bonville himself, captured after the Second Battle of St Albans was summarily beheaded – probably, so the chroniclers tell us, after a mock trial directly instigated by the Earl of Devon.|$|E
