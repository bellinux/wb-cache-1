6000|$|Blindly, instinctively, Crayford made {{an effort}} to part them. His brother officers, {{standing}} near, pulled him back. They looked at each other anxiously. The merciless <b>cold,</b> <b>striking</b> its victims in various ways, had struck in some instances at their reason first. Everybody loved Crayford. Was he, too, going on the dark way that others had taken before him? They forced him to seat himself on one of the lockers. [...] "Steady, old fellow!" [...] they said kindly--"steady!" [...] Crayford yielded, writhing inwardly under the sense of his own helplessness. What in God's name could he do? Could he denounce Wardour to Captain Helding on bare suspicion--without so much as the shadow of a proof to justify what he said? The captain would decline to insult one of his officers by even mentioning the monstrous accusation to him. The captain would conclude, as others had already concluded, that Crayford's mind was giving way under stress of cold and privation. No hope--literally, no hope now, but in the numbers of the expedition. Officers and men, they all liked Frank. As long as they could stir hand or foot, they would help him on the way--they would see that no harm came to him.|$|E
50|$|After the Second World War, he was {{regarded}} as the top researcher and constructor specialized in automation of the striking technology, mainly in techniques of <b>cold</b> <b>striking,</b> which were positively reviewed in abroad. This technology allowed minting a medal with a record diameter of 150 mm in an incredibly short period of five days beginning with a sketch and ending with the medal. That was the biggest world medal exhibited at Salon International de la Médaille 1949, in Paris. The annual report of the Kremnica Mint (2011) states that in 1948 the Mint was recognized at the world fair of medal manufacturers (FIDEM) in Paris for its medal with a diameter of 150 mm, which remained unsurpassed until the early 21st century.|$|E
40|$|Increased {{awareness}} of the medical and social costs of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) has resulted in greater attention to the control of these illnesses. STDs are responsible for {{a significant amount of}} morbidity in Morocco and have become a key target of the HIV control program. In 1996, the Ministry of Health conducted a qualitative study in order to enhance information, education and communication strategies in the national STD/HIV program. Data on the conceptualization and knowledge of STD, information sources and health-care-seeking behavior were gathered through 70 semidirected, in-depth interviews conducted with {{men and women in the}} general population and health care providers (HCPs). Two commonly applied health behavior theories in STD/HIV prevention, the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) served as a framework for data analysis. The most common name for STD is berd, which means "the cold" in Moroccan Arabic. Berd is caused either by <b>cold</b> <b>striking</b> the genital area or sexual intercourse and most often designates a syndrome of genital discharge. However, the term was also often used to indicate STD in general. The dual causality of berd maintains social stability by providing an honorable excuse for individuals who become infected, while warning against unsanctioned sexual behavior. Clear gender differences in understanding STDs and health-care-seeking behavior emerged through these interviews. STDs in Morocco are viewed as women's illnesses and men with STD often reported feeling victimized by women. Men appear to have more extensive informal information sources for STD than women. Consequences of STD, both physical and psychosocial, were viewed as more severe for women than men, and men had greater access to treatment, for both social and economic reasons.

60|$|The {{cause of}} all which Phænomena I imagine to be no other then this, That the Parts of the Glass being by the {{excessive}} heat of the fire kept off and separated one from another, and thereby put {{into a kind of}} sluggish fluid consistence, are suffered to drop off with that heat or agitation remaining in them, into cold Water; by which means the outsides of the drop are presently cool'd and crusted, and are thereby made of a loose texture, because the parts of it have not time to settle themselves leisurely together, and so to lie very close together: And the innermost parts of the drop, retaining still much of their former heat and agitations, remain of a loose texture also, and, according as the <b>cold</b> <b>strikes</b> inwards from the bottom and sides, are quenched, as it were, and made rigid in that very posture wherein the cold finds them. For the parts of the crust being already hardened, will not suffer the parts to shrink any more from the outward Surface inward; and though it shrink a little by reason of the small parcels of some Aerial substances dispersed through the matter of the Glass, yet that is not neer so much as it appears (as I just now hinted;) nor if it were, would it be sufficient for to consolidate and condense the body of Glass into a tuff and close texture, after it had been so excessively rarified by the heat of the glass-Furnace.|$|R

The analysis of the temperature-load coupling of these pavement structures from seven different base forms were conducted. The comprehensive comparison was also made, such as stresses and strains at the bottom layer of asphalt, the stresses of the base, the shear stresses of the asphalt layer, and the compressive strains {{of the top of}} base, etc., in order to choose the preferred and most adapted asphalt pavement structure form...|$|R

50|$|Green's {{position}} {{with his new}} team—as well as his career—was instantly put in jeopardy on October 7 as he suffered another severe concussion early {{in a game against}} the Texans at Houston. With just under 4 minutes to play in the first quarter, Green put his shoulder low to the knees of 315-pound Houston defensive tackle Travis Johnson in a successful attempt to block him on a play that started with a fumbled handoff to Dolphins rookie wide receiver Ted Ginn Jr. Ginn, who was running right-to-left across the backfield when the exchange was fumbled, recovered the ball near the sidelines and then reversed field. Johnson went down in a sprawling tumble on the block at the same time Green fell face-down to the turf, knocked out <b>cold</b> after <b>striking</b> Johnson's knee with his helmet. Johnson, upon getting up and seeing Ginn had been stopped and the play ended, immediately walked towards Green's body, jabbing his finger at the motionless quarterback. Johnson was flagged with a 15-yard penalty for taunting, and medical personnel quickly made their way to Green. After being examined on the field for nearly five minutes, Green was carted off on a stretcher as Cleo Lemon stepped in to take his place.|$|R

40|$|The {{voltage-gated}} {{sodium channel}} Nav 1. 8 {{is known to}} function in the transmission of pain signals induced by cold, heat, and mechanical stimuli. Sequence variants of human Nav 1. 8 {{have been linked to}} altered cardiac conduction. We identified an allele of Scn 10 a encoding the α-subunit of Nav 1. 8 among mice homozygous for N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mutations. The allele creates a dominant neurobehavioral phenotype termed Possum, characterized by transient whole-body tonic immobility induced by pinching the skin {{at the back of the}} neck (“scruffing”). The Possum mutation enhanced Nav 1. 8 sodium currents and neuronal excitability and heightened sensitivity of mutants to <b>cold</b> stimuli. <b>Striking</b> electroencephalographic changes were observed concomitant with the scruffing-induced behavioral change. In addition, electrocardiography demonstrated that Possum mice exhibited marked sinus bradycardia and R-R variability upon scruffing, abrogated by infusion of atropine. However, atropine failed to prevent or mitigate the tonic immobility response. Hyperactive sodium conduction via Nav 1. 8 thus leads to a complex neurobehavioral phenotype, which resembles catatonia in schizophrenic humans and tonic immobility in other mammals upon application of a discrete stimulus; no other form of mechanosensory stimulus could induce the immobility phenotype. Our data confirm the involvement of Nav 1. 8 in transducing pain initiated by cold and additionally implicate Nav 1. 8 in previously unknown functions in the central nervous system and heart...|$|R
