5|$|The Middleton Junction and Oldham Branch Railway was {{routed through}} Chadderton. Middleton Junction railway station {{was within the}} town limits. Opened on 31 March 1842 it closed in 1966. On 12 August 1914 Chadderton goods and <b>coal</b> <b>depot</b> was opened. The depot {{was at the end}} of a 1097 yards long branch which came off the Middleton Junction to Oldham line at Chadderton Junction. The line from Chadderton Junction to Oldham Werneth was closed on 7 January 1963, but Chadderton goods and <b>coal</b> <b>depot</b> {{remained}} open for a period. Electric tramways to and from Middleton opened in 1902. Tram services ran along Middleton Road and terminated in Chadderton. The final tram ran in 1935. The Oldham Loop Line closed as a heavy rail line in 2009, and reopened in June 2012 as part of a new Manchester Metrolink light-rail line from Manchester Victoria to Rochdale via Oldham. South Chadderton Metrolink station, Freehold Metrolink station and the former Hollinwood railway station are part of the conversion to Metrolink. Proposals to extend the Metrolink system through Chadderton were announced in January 2016. The proposed link would add a spur between Westwood tram stop and Middleton with the line continuing to the Bury line near Bowker Vale.|$|E
5|$|In November 1891, notice {{was given}} {{of a private}} bill that would be {{presented}} to Parliament {{for the construction of}} the Hampstead, St Pancras & Charing Cross Railway (HStP). The railway was planned to run entirely underground from Heath Street in Hampstead to Strand in Charing Cross. The route was to run beneath Hampstead High Street, Rosslyn Hill, Haverstock Hill and Chalk Farm Road to Camden Town and then under Camden High Street and Hampstead Road to Euston Road. The route then continued south, following Tottenham Court Road, Charing Cross Road and King William Street (now William IV Street) to Agar Street adjacent to Strand. North of Euston Road, a branch was to run eastwards from the main alignment under Drummond Street to serve the main line stations at Euston, St Pancras and King's Cross. Stations were planned at Hampstead, Belsize Park, Chalk Farm, Camden Town, Seymour Street (now part of Eversholt Street), Euston Road, Tottenham Court Road, Oxford Street, Agar Street, Euston and King's Cross. Although a decision had not been made between the use of cable haulage or electric traction as the means of pulling the trains, a power station was planned on Chalk Farm Road close to the London and North Western Railway's Chalk Farm station (later renamed Primrose Hill) which had a <b>coal</b> <b>depot</b> for deliveries.|$|E

2500|$|The Midland Railway {{operated}} {{a kind of}} Super Outer Circle from 1878 to 1880. In 1876 the Midland had negotiated running rights over the District Railway from the London & South Western Railway at Hammersmith to South Kensington. The Midland's main interest was supplying coal to Kensington, and in 1878 it opened <b>coal</b> <b>depots</b> at Kensington High Street and West Kensington. From 1 May 1878 it also ran a passenger service from Earl's Court to St Pancras via Hammersmith, [...] and the Dudding Hill freight line to [...] Two trains an hour ran until 30 September 1880. The <b>coal</b> <b>depots</b> closed in the 1960s.|$|R

25|$|The British {{were looking}} for a <b>coal</b> <b>depot</b> to service their steamers en route to India. It took 700 tons of coal for a round-trip from Suez to Bombay. East India Company {{officials}} decided on Aden. The British Empire tried to reach an agreement with the Zaydi imam of Sana'a, permitting them a foothold in Mocha, and when unable to secure their position, they extracted a similar agreement from the Sultan of Lahej, enabling them to consolidate a position in Aden. An incident played into British hands when, while passing Aden for trading purposes, one of their sailing ships sank and Arab tribesmen boarded it and plundered its contents. The British India government dispatched a warship under the command of Captain Stafford Bettesworth Haines to demand compensation.|$|E
25|$|Sir Edward Hughes was {{launched}} in 1784 as an East Indiaman for the British East India Company (EIC). She spent four years as a country ship, i.e., sailing in the East Indies but without going to Britain. Then between 1788 and 1803 she made eight voyages to India and China for the EIC. In 1804 the EIC sold Sir Edward Hughes to the British Royal Navy, which commissioned her as a 38-gun frigate. The Navy renamed her Tortoise in 1807 and converted her to a storeship in 1808. After {{the end of the}} Napoleonic Wars she became variously a <b>coal</b> <b>depot,</b> a hulk, and then a convict transport. In 1844 she became a receiving ship at Ascension Island. She was lost there in 1859, or broken up there in 1860, or 1863.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{development}} of the Kent coalfields {{in the early part of}} the 20th century, house coal from the north for distribution in south London and as far afield as Maidstone and Brighton was an important source of revenue. Access at the north end of the line was difficult: trains were limited to 26 wagons and had to be shunted into the Great Eastern's Liverpool Street station and drawn forward onto the ELR. To avoid this reversal, a line was planned from the ELR north of Whitechapel to the GER at Bethnal Green. Acts for this were passed in 1866 and 1868. When the GER route to Hackney Downs Junction, now Hackney Downs, was constructed in 1872, the route was altered to connect at Cambridge Heath, with an abandonment Act for the previous route in 1871 and two new Acts in 1876 and 1877. A short length of the latter tunnel was built, and from October 1900 additional capacity was offered by a wagon lift, carrying two ten-ton wagons, from the Great Eastern <b>coal</b> <b>depot</b> at Spitalfields to a siding laid in the tunnel stub. The surface junction was taken up in 1966 and the lift closed in 1967, after a fire at the Spitalfields depot.|$|E
50|$|Coal trains, each {{consisting}} {{of up to}} 85 wagons, were despatched from the marshalling yards at Toton (between Nottingham and Derby), and received at Brent sidings. Here, they were split up and forwarded to the Midland Railway's own <b>coal</b> <b>depots</b> around London, and also to the London area marshalling yards belonging to other railways.|$|R

500|$|The {{double track}} loop through {{the station was}} {{extended}} at both ends in March 1912, with the platforms also extended. A small goods yard and <b>coal</b> <b>depot</b> was built at the north-west end of the station at the same time. A signal box {{was built on the}} southern platform {{at the end of the}} First World War. By 1929, services had increased to 21 trains per day on weekdays and eight per day on Sundays. This allowed a train every half-hour, with one train per hour running to Bristol Temple Meads and the other terminating at [...] Passenger traffic was mainly commuters, to both Bristol and Portishead, as well as people who wished to use the Pill ferry across the river to Shirehampton. During the Second World War, many evacuees from Bristol commutered into the city from Pill. The station staff at this time consisted of a station master, two porters and two female signallers.|$|E

500|$|Radstock was the {{terminus}} for {{the southern}} branch of the Somerset Coal Canal which was subsequently turned into a tramway and became the centre for railway development and <b>coal</b> <b>depots,</b> <b>coal</b> washeries, workshops and a gas works. As part {{of the development of}} the Wiltshire, Somerset and Weymouth Railway, an [...] line from Radstock to Frome was built to carry coal. In the 1870s the broad-gauge line was converted to standard gauge and connected to the Bristol and North Somerset Line connecting it to the Great Western Railway. The Radstock railway site comprises approximately 8.8 hectares of land which has been subject to planning and development applications.|$|R

2500|$|The {{overall picture}} was further {{complicated}} by the establishment of <b>coal</b> <b>depots</b> in South London by the [...] "northern" [...] companies, mainly the MR and GNR, which enabled them {{to take control of}} the whole transit of the coal from colliery to local distributor.
