40|$|Rotary tiller {{generally}} {{refers to}} breaking down soil aggregates into ultimate soil particles. The degree of <b>clod</b> <b>breaking</b> depends on moisture content, tillage implements {{and intensity of}} <b>clod</b> <b>breaking.</b> One unit of animal drawn rotary tiller with L - shapes of blades was developed and fabricated at workshop of Faculty of Agricultural Engineering, Raipur. The effective field capacity of animal drawn rotary tiller (18 blades) was found 0. 12 ha/h at a forward speed of 2. 5 km/h. The field efficiency of 62. 85 % was observed during the field performance. The draft requirement of the developed animal drawn rotary tiller is 378 N. Mean Mass Diameter (MMD) of soil clod size was found 28. 42 mm. The operational cost was found 384 Rs/ha...|$|E
40|$|Clod {{crushing}} is {{a principal}} problem with soils of high clay content. Therefore, {{there is a need}} for determining the conditions for <b>clod</b> <b>breaking</b> and clod crushing. The objective of the work was to develop a special purpose tool for single <b>clod</b> <b>breaking</b> both by rigid support of the clod and by a single clod supported by soil and to develop a machine for clod crushing. Furthermore, the purpose was to determine the relationship between the specific energy requirement for clod crushing in the function of soil plasticity and the soil moisture content by the means of the developed tool and machine. The main result of the experiments is summarized in a 3 D diagram where the specific energy requirement for soil clod crushing is given in the function of the moisture content and the plasticity index for different clay soils...|$|E

40|$|Walking {{around on}} a {{perfectly}} manicured golf course, it's easy to forget most of the plant is below ground. It almost {{goes without saying that}} proper soil management is vital in turf management. The best kind of soil structure for plant growth is granular structure, which resembles cookie crumbs and is usually less than 0. 5 centimeter in diameter. One important soil property that can be easily overlooked is soil structure or tilth. Soil structure refers to the spatial arrangement of soil particles. These aggregates form through physical, chemical and biological processes, which will greatly influence soil quality (Brady and Weil, 2008). Good soil structure is a hallmark of healthy soil. If soils are healthy, then healthy turf can follow. An easy way to determine soil structure quality is to collect surface soil between 5 centimeters (cm) and 10 cm deep. Gently toss the soil in {{the palm of your hand}} to break up the soil. Take a representative soil clod and gently try to break it apart. If the <b>clod</b> <b>breaks</b> or fractures along a plane, it means you have some structure. If the clod tears apart, then it's a clear indication you have very poor or no structure...|$|R
40|$|To study Assessing {{the impact}} of tillage {{practices}} on soil carbon losses dependents {{it is necessary to}} describe the temporal variability of soil CO 2 emission after tillage. It has been argued that large amounts of CO 2 emitted after tillage may serve as an indicator for longer-term changes in soil carbon stocks. Here we present a two-step function model based on soil temperature and soil moisture including an exponential decay in time component that is efficient in fitting intermediate-term emission after disk plow followed by a leveling harrow (conventional), and chisel plow coupled with a roller for <b>clod</b> <b>breaking</b> (reduced) tillage. Emission after reduced tillage was described using a non-linear estimator with determination coefficient (R²) as high as 0. 98. Results indicate that when emission after tillage is addressed {{it is important to consider}} an exponential decay in time in order to predict {{the impact of}} tillage in short-term emissions...|$|E
40|$|Both the {{inadequate}} use and {{the ignorance}} of the different soil tillage implements available in the home market {{has become one of}} the leading motives of failures, related to soil and water conservation. The periodical tillage is traditionally utilized after subsoiling for soil <b>clod</b> <b>breaking,</b> leveling and residue incorporation. This work aimed to evaluate the energy requirement for different periodical soil tillage systems performed before and after subsoiling in a soil classified as Distroferric Red Nitosol. The periodic tillage systems were: disk plowing; disk plowing plus one leveling harrowing; disk harrow; disk harrow plus leveling harrowing stirring. The experimental design was a 5 x 2 factorial scheme with 5 completely randomized blocks. The results show that the periodic soil preparation systems based on disks have better energy efficiency when performed before the operation of subsoiling. The system of soil preparation with harrowing obtained the lower energy demand, in relation to other periodic soil preparation systems, when done after subsoiling...|$|E

50|$|The {{agreement}} was highly unfavourable to Henry and Edward, {{but it must}} be assumed that they agreed to it under duress, since Edward was held hostage by the barons after the defeat at Lewes. On 15 August the document was dispatched to King Louis IX of France, who previously had been acting as an arbiter between the two parties. Louis had already rejected the terms of the Mise of Lewes; the stricter conditions of the Peace of Canterbury might have been intended to bring pressure on the French king, to help bring about a settlement. King Louis, however, rejected the proposition in angry terms. He was reported to have said that he would rather <b>break</b> <b>clods</b> behind a plough than have this sort of kingly rule. Montfort's government after this gradually started running into problems. In the spring of 1265, Gloucester defected {{to the side of the}} royalists, and Edward managed to escape his captivity. The baronial rule came to an end on 4 August 1265, when Montfort was defeated and killed at the Battle of Evesham, and Henry was restored to full powers.|$|R
60|$|It {{was early}} morning when I rode alone towards Crane Valley, feeling, {{in spite of}} Dixon's good advice, {{distinctly}} anxious. It is true that Thorn and Steel were both energetic, but no man can drive two teams at once, {{and it was my}} impression that, having more at stake, I could do considerably more in person than either of them. I had small comfort in the reflection that, after all, the question how much had been accomplished was immaterial, because there was little use in sowing where, while I lay in jail, an enemy might reap, and I urged my horse when I drew near the hollow in which the homestead lay, and then pulled him up with a jerk. Gordon had said things had been going tolerably well, but this proved a very inadequate description. The plowed land had all been harrowed and sown, and beyond it lay the shattered <b>clods</b> of fresh <b>breaking,</b> where I guessed oats had been sown under the sod newly torn from the virgin prairie. Ten men of greater endurance could not have accomplished so much, and I sat still, humbled and very grateful, with eyes that grew momentarily dim, fixed on the wide stretch of black soil steaming under the morning sun. It seemed as though a beneficent genie had been working for my deliverance while I lay, almost despairing, in the grip of the law.|$|R

[...] said Harry, bending his {{uncovered}} head, as, a sinewy, graceful {{figure in}} dusty canvas, {{with the white}} sod behind him, he helped her across a raw strip of steaming clod, while neither of us spoke again until we had completed another furrow. It was a glorious spring, and not for long years had there been such a seed time, the men who helped us said, while my hopes rose with every fresh acre we drilled with the good grain. I was sowing the best that was within me {{as well as the}} best hard wheat, and it seemed that {{the rest of my life}} depended on the result of it. There is no need to tell how we labored among the black <b>clods</b> of the <b>breaking,</b> or the dust that followed the harrows, under the cool of morning or the mid-day sun, for we were young and strong, fighting for our own hand, with a great reward before at least one of us. Still, at times I remembered Lee, who was in his own way fighting a harder battle against drunkenness and misery, the reward of which was only hardship and poverty. Once I said so to Aline, and she answered me: [...] "It was his vocation; he could not help it. Yours, and I do not think you could help it either--you would have made a remarkably poor preacher, Ralph--is to break new wheat-lands out of the wilderness; for, you will remember--well, I'm not a preacher either, but not wholly for Grace or yourself." ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Implements for tilling {{compacted}} {{forest soils}} were tested on sites logged with ground-based machines in Oregon. The sites covered {{a variety of}} soil conditions ranging from a clay loam to a rock 7 2 C 2 iplemeflts tested included disk harrows (four aies), brusa blades (three sites), standard subsoiler tines (two sites), wing. - ed subsoiler tines (two sites), and rock ripper tines (five sites). Soil density and strength measurements made prior to the tillage operatIons indicated that the depth of compacted soil within primary skid trails exceeded 12 inches and was often detectable {{to a depth of}} 18 inches. Logging debris typically was incorporated into the skid trail surfaces. The disk harrow proved ineffective for loosening compacted forest soils at depth when: 1) the soil had a high rock content, 2) disk weighting was insufficient, or 3) the trail cross-section was concave and the harrow wide. The brush blade failed to loosen the deeper layers of compaction and resulted in transfer of some of the loosened soil to the trail edges. The short closely-spaced tines did not allow loosened soil and logging debris to pass between the tines. The performance of subsoiler and rock ripper tines was favorable in the rocky coarse-grained soils and some of the cohesive soils. However, plastic flow rather than shatterin. g occurred when tines operated below their crit- [...] ical depth. The critical depth was controlled by soil conditions and tue geometry. The winged subsoiler tines resulted in 30 to 64 percent greater shattering than did standard subsoiler tines at a ripping depth of 1. 5 feet. Close tine spacing caused logging debris to accumulate in front of the tines. The tines produced large angular clods when working in a cohesive soil. These <b>clods</b> did not <b>break</b> down after heavy rains. Clods from coarse-grain soils broke down readily when moistened. A trapezoid-shaped representatjoii of the soil sbattering pattern produced by tines was shown to compare adequately with actual shattering patterns. A computer program was developed to analyze ripping depth and tine spacing combinations resulting in maximum shattering across the skid trail width. The cost of the tillage operations ranged from 89 to 228 per mile of skid trail (1980 - 1981 dollars) ...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{structure}} can {{be strongly}} damaged by compaction which derives from compressive forces of wheels and tillage machinery applied to soils under farming systems. Compaction process alters the spatial arrangement, {{size and shape}} of clods and aggregates. As a consequence, the soil bulk density and the soil strength increase and the soil functioning is severely disturbed with a reduction in permeability to air, water and heat which in turn affects environmental quality, root and shoot growth and consequently crop production. Compaction causes a restriction in root penetration and rooting depth, an increase in root diameter and a reduction in water and nutrient uptake. However the responses in rooting stress and then in plant growth to compaction are controversial. They depend on the degree of compaction, its depth and persistence both laterally and vertically, on the texture of soils and their capacity to transfer water and more on weather conditions. Indeed, the crop production is strongly influenced by water stocks invested by roots. It was also observed that roots are preferentially confined to macropores as earthworm’s galleries, voids, cracks, bypassing generally compacted clods with a clump effect in loose soil. For high rainfall intensity, it results in preferential water flow which may supply enough water to plants. In addition compaction damage is not irreversible. As a result of climate activity, soil cracking through wetting and drying, fauna activity, compacted <b>clods</b> may progressively <b>break</b> down with decreasing soil impedance and changing in water retention and flow. Given the above mentioned debate, the objective {{of this study was to}} examine in space and time at high resolution the eventual changes in water content and soil structure of cropped soil as compared to bare soil after a prior compaction by in-field wheel traffic. Our study focused on the growing season of wheat crop. From in-field experiment, a precise time monitoring of water content and soil structure was analysed at the soil profile scale on a loamy-clay soil. The methods used to estimate both variables consisted in local soil sampling and visual morphological descriptions supplemented by Electrical Resistivity Tomographies (ERT), which have already been proven to be useful and efficient enough to describe soil water changes and the structural variability in soils. Our results enhanced the relevant impact of compaction on water transfer and, therefore, on availability of water reserves for plants. Compacted zones created by wheel tracks and the tillage pan restricted root penetration and remained wetter than the loosen matrix. However these results depend on climatic events. As observed after rainfalls, reduced infiltration due to compaction was overcome by preferential flow pathways identified at borders of clods where roots were relatively clumped. In addition, the ploughpan was shown to be a restrictive layer for water flow. These combined effects modified in time water stocks in the rooting zone as well as the structural resilience of clods...|$|R
