The current study evaluated a confined, non-conductive thermal, 3 -nanosecond pulse laser {{in order to determine}} how to produce the greatest therapeutic range without causing collateral damage. Data were compared with that obtained from a standard thermal laser. Materials and Methods: Porcine ocular explants were used; apposed neuroretina was also in place <b>for</b> actual <b>laser</b> treatment. After treatment, the retina was removed and a calcein-AM assay was used to assess retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) cell viability in the explants. Histological methods were also employed to examine lased transverse explant sections. Three nanoseconds pulse lasers with either speckle- or gaussian-beam profile were employed in the study. Comparisons were made with a 100 [*]milliseconds continuous wave (CW) 532 [*]nm laser. The therapeutic energy range ratio was defined as the minimum visible effect threshold (VET) versus the minimum detectable RPE kill threshold. Results: The 3 -nanosecond lasers produced markedly lower minimum RPE kill threshold levels than the CW laser (e. g., 36 [*]mJ/cm 2 for speckle-beam and 89 [*]mJ/cm 2 for gaussian-beam profile nanosecond lasers vs. 7, 958 [*]mJ/cm 2 <b>for</b> <b>CW</b> <b>laser).</b> VET values were also correspondingly lower <b>for</b> the nanosecond <b>lasers</b> (130 [*]mJ/cm 2 for 3 [*]nanoseconds speckle-beam and 219 [*]mJ/cm 2 for gaussian-beam profile vs. 1, 0346 [*]mJ/cm 2 <b>for</b> <b>CW</b> <b>laser).</b> Thus, the therapeutic range ratios obtained with the nanosecond lasers were much more favorable than that obtained by the CW laser: 3. 6 : 1 for the speckle-beam and 2. 5 : 1 for the gaussian-beam profile 3 -nanosecond lasers versus 1. 3 : 1 <b>for</b> the <b>CW</b> <b>laser.</b> Conclusions: Nanosecond lasers, particularly with a speckle-beam profile, provide a much wider therapeutic range of energies over which RPE treatment can be performed, without damage to the apposed retina, as compared with conventional CW lasers.

The influence of the pressure results in spreading of the melted solder on the aluminum material.

Fiber optics technology has the capability to meet the requirements of these applications. Thus far, the vast majority of research on fiber-optic analog communications has concentrated on the modulation of continuous wave (<b>CW)</b> <b>lasers</b> <b>for</b> encoding data, such as sub-carrier multiplexing (SCM). However, since the signals are multiplexed and demultiplexed in the electrical domain, the maximum number of channels is limited in such a system due to intermodulation distortion caused by nonlinearities in the electrical-optical-electrical conversion process. In contrast, the techniques presented in the work are based on the multiplexing and demultiplexing of signals in the optical domain, thereby reducing nonlinear interactions between channels. In our approach, each analog signal is encoded as an envelope onto an optical pulse train. By using ultrashort optical pulses to sample the analog waveforms, multiple channels can be interleaved and combined resulting in TDMA frames of pulsed analog data. The individual channels can then be extracted from the aggregate pulse stream with the use of an ultrafast optical gating device, such as the terahertz optical asymmetric demultiplexer...|$|R

Advanced ultrafast mode-locked lasers can generate broad optical frequency combs with unprecedented stability. This breakthrough has revolutionized the field of frequency metrology, as it allows for bi-directional conversion between high (optical) and low (radio, microwave) frequencies (cf. [1, 2]). However, noise sources in the lasing medium induce a jitter in the pulses, which, in turn, broadens the comb lines. We derive the fundamental scaling laws of the linewidth induced by Spontaneous Emission (SE) or quantum noise for a general jitter scaling law.
