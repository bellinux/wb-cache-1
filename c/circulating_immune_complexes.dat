The cause of death from smallpox is not clear, but the infection is now known to involve multiple organs. <b>Circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes,</b> overwhelming viremia, or an uncontrolled immune response may be contributing factors. In early hemorrhagic smallpox, death occurs suddenly about six days after the fever develops. Cause of death in hemorrhagic cases involved heart failure, sometimes accompanied by pulmonary edema.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{pathophysiology}} of the postpolio {{syndrome is}} not fully understood. Increased cytokine levels in cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood indicate a systemic inflammatory process. Decreased cytokine levels and the clinical effect of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment further indicate an inflammatory/immunological pathogenesis. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate whether an autoimmune process follows the initial infection, by means of analyzing <b>immune</b> <b>complexes.</b> Patients and methodsCirculating <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> were analyzed from blood samples of 20 postpolio patients and 95 healthy controls. To compensate for differences in age between patients and controls, a sub-analysis was performed using only the 30 oldest controls.

40|$|Purpose: To Study {{immune status}} in {{patients}} with coxarthrosis consequent to treatment of congenital hip dysplasia and Perthes' disease {{as well as to}} determine additional variables indicating arthrosis progression. Materials and methods: The authors analyzed results of preoperative immune examination of 13 male patients aged 11, 4 ± 0, 7 years (10 - 13) with coxarthrosis of type I-II developed consequently to treatment of hip dysplasia and Perthes' disease. Based on obtained anatomical and functional outcomes the authors divided the patients into two groups. First group included 8 patients with postoperative improvement of joint function and absence of disease progression. Second group (5 patients) was featured by functional deterioration and arthrosis advancing. Results: Patients of the second group demonstrated statistically significant elevation in certain parameters of humoral (<b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complex)</b> and cellular immunity (CD 3 +HLA-DR (%), CD 3 +HLA-DR (109 /l)) as well as interleukin- 6.

40|$|Rheumatoid factor (RF) {{production}} {{has been demonstrated}} during infections, including infectious exacerbations of cystic fibrosis (CF). The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the relationship of RF production to infection, and examine the mechanisms involved. Serial peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures with measurement of spontaneous production of IgM RF, IgA RF, total IgM and IgA, and measurement of serum levels of <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> were carried out during exacerbations of CF. The percentage of B cells expressing CD 5 was examined in a second cohort of acutely infected CF patients, and related to IgM RF production. IgM RF production was significantly elevated during acute infection compared with convalescence (P < 0. 05), stable CF subjects (P < 0. 005) and normal controls (P < 0. 05). IgM RF production did not correlate with total IgM production in the majority of patients, but was closely related to <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complex</b> levels in 8 / 10 subjects. IgA RF production did not increase significantly during infection, and did not correlate with total IgA or IgM RF production, or with <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complex</b> levels. CD 5 + B cells were not increased in the CF group, and the percentage of CD 5 + B cells did not correlate with IgM RF synthesis.

40|$|Since mucosal immune {{response}} involving IgA {{may be particularly}} important in the pathogenesis of gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE), we examined the sera of 22 patients with GSE for IgA-containing <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> using a sensitive radioimmunoassay, the Raji cell assay for IgA-containing <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes.</b> The Raji cell assay for IgG-containing <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> and the 125 I-C 1 q-binding assay were also used to measure IgG- or IgM-containing <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> in these patients.

Neither the presence nor level of immune complexes correlated with disease activity in any of the patients studied. Five patients, whose disease was well controlled on a gluten-free diet, were studied serially during dietary challenge with gluten. It was found that IgA-containing <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> did not develop or increase in amount in the serum of these patients despite the induction of gastrointestinal symptoms.

40|$|Using the Raji cell {{radioimmunoassay}} (RCRIA) {{reported by}} Theofilopoulos et al., 26 serum samples from {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) patients were evaluated. All of those patients had definite granular immune deposits in renal biopsy specimens, {{and the presence of}} <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complex</b> in these patients was also suspected. RCRIA values of these patients were generally higher than those of normal human sera. RCRIA values were compared with other serological parameters of SLE including serum complement (CH(50)), serum gammaglobulin, anti-double stranded DNA antibody, anti-nuclear ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and anti-lymphocyte antibody. There was no correlation between the RCRIA values and anti-lymhocyte antibody. The correlation with CH(50) was also rather negative. There was positive correlations between the RCRIA values and serum gammaglobulin and anti-ds DNA antibody. However there were four serum samples which were negative to anti-ds DNA antibody but high RCRIA values. Three samples had high anti-RNP antibody titiers. The data suggest that not only the ds-DNA antigen-antibody system, but also other kinds of antigen-antibody systems may compose the <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complex.</b> The RCRIA values of sera from SLE patients using Raji cells killed by 100 % acetone instead of living cells were generally higher. The increases in the RCRIA values were regarded as being due to the participation of anti-nuclear antibodies present in the patients' sera. Thus, in evaluating SLE sera, there is the possibility that the RCRIA may give false positive results due to the presence of antibodies, including antinuclear antibodies, which react with Raji cells. As long as this possibility is kept in mind, the RCRIA value may become a valuable serological index of SLE...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] <b>Circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> can be {{elevated}} in serum {{samples of}} patients with sarcoidosis and are associated with disease activity, but their diagnostic significance is not understood. METHODS [...] The different classes of <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> containing immunoglobulin A, G, or M, {{and the content of}} complement in <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> (polyethylene glycol precipitation) as well as levels of complement binding <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> (complement binding assay) were determined in 19 patients with active, untreated pulmonary sarcoidosis. The results were compared with other parameters in the serum (soluble interleukin 2 receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme, immunoglobulin A, G, and M) and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (lymphocytes, helper cells, suppressor cells, activated T cells), and with radiological stage and functional parameters (FEV 1, vital capacity, total lung capacity, transfer coefficient (KCO), and the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference during exercise). RESULTS [...] In all patients <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> could be detected by polyethylene glycol precipitation and were similar to control subjects. The content of C 1 q in <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> was higher than in controls, yet in {{all but one of the}} cases was still within normal limits. In contrast, elevated levels of complement binding <b>circulating</b> <b>immune</b> <b>complexes</b> were found in 67 % of the patients.

Several murine models of skin inflammation were found to develop autoantibodies to Dsg 3 tightly correlated with disease aggravation, especially in MRL lpr/lpr mice. Furthermore, SLE-prone skin disease-free FcγRIIb-deficient mice developed skin inflammation upon immunization with Dsg 3.
