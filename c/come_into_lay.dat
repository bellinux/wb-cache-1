40|$|THE {{reproductive}} {{system of the}} fowl undergoes remarkable changes at sexual maturity at which time a weight increment of several thousand percent occurs in both the oviduct and ovary in-side a few weeks. It is also well established that a very large increase in weight of the oviduct in the adult fowl occurs when egg laying recommences following periods of ovarian inactivity and {{that many of the}} changes which take place as a hen <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> <b>lay</b> can be simulated by the injection of sex hormones into immature pullets. These effects of sex hormones in birds have been reviewed by Parkes and Em-mens (1944) and Lorenz (1954). The injection of oestrogen will evoke an increase in oviduct size and changes in blood composition, although the ovaries remain quiescent. The production of lipaemia in birds by the administration of oestrogens has been confirmed by variou...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT One-day-old pullet {{chickens}} from {{an infectious}} bronchitis-free flock we e exposed to Massachusetts serotype infectious bronchitis virus. Permanent damage was caused in the oviduct {{which led to}} permanently reduced production and quality when the chickens <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>lay.</b> The following characteristics of eggs from infected chickens were found in significant numbers: faculty-shaped eggs, calcareous deposits, ridges on the shell surface, yolk separating from albumen and albumen sticking to shell membrane on breaking the egg. Each chicken was consistent {{in the type of}} egg laid and there was a positive correlation between abnormal egg quality and morphological lesions in the oviduct. There was also a positive correlation between shell and internal abnormalities. POULTRY SCIENCE 51 : 582 - 585, 1972 INFECTIOUS bronchitis (LB.) has long been associated with the reproductive tract (Van Roekel et al., 1939). Hens that have recovered from the disease lay eggs of poor internal and external quality. Produc-tion is also reduced (Urban and Goodwin...|$|R

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 infection in birds is low but several deliberate inoculation {{studies show that}} poultry are readily and persistently infected by this organism indicating a possible threat to public health. The mechanisms of colonisation of poultry are not understood and {{the aim is to}} establish models to study the interaction of E. coli O 157 :H 7, at the cellular and whole animal levels. A non-toxigenic E. coli O 157 :H 7 (NCTC 12900) was used in adherence assays with an avian epithelial cell line (Div- 1) and used to inoculate 1 -day-old SPF chicks. In vitro, NCTC 12900 induced micro-colonies associated with cytoskeletal arrangements and pedestal formation with intimate bacterial attachment. In the 1 -day-old SPF chick, a dose of 1 × 105 cfu resulted in rapid and extensive colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract and transient colonisation of the liver and spleen. The number of E. coli O 157 :H 7 organisms attained approximately 108 cfu/ml caecal homogenate 24 h after inoculation and approximately 107 cfu/ml caecal homogenate was still present at day 92. Faecal shedding persisted for 169 days, ceasing 9 days after the birds <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>lay</b> and 6 % of eggs were contaminated on the eggshell. Histological analysis of tissue samples from birds dosed with 1 × 107 cfu gave evidence for E. coli O 157 :H 7 NCTC 12900 induced micro-colonies on the caecal mucosa, although evidence for attaching effacing lesions was equivocal. These models may be suitable to study those factors of E. coli O 157 :H 7 that mediate persistent colonisation in avian species...|$|R
5000|$|The fish has a {{distinctive}} [...] "foghorn" [...] sound used by males to attract {{females in the}} mating season, which is April-October. The sound-producing (sonic) muscles attached to its swimbladders are the fastest known vertebrate muscles. Following the foghorn sound, the female <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> the nest, <b>lays</b> eggs, and then leaves (the toadfish lays the largest eggs of any Chesapeake Bay fish). The male fertilizes the eggs; they hatch after about one month. When the eggs hatch, the young toadfish stay attached to the yolk for some time. When the yolk has been absorbed for energy, the young toadfish learn to swim. Even when the young have started to swim, the adult still protects its young.|$|R

40|$|The {{trial was}} started by {{importing}} GDR chicken from Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany and indigenous Cameroon fowl by collecting eggs from villages in the Western highland area of Cameroon hatched at the Institute of Animal and Veterinary Research, Mankon (Cameroon). The males of the base population were subjected to fattening test (body weight performance) up to 12 weeks of age. Approximately 10 percent of the birds were slaughtered at 12 weeks of age to determine gizzard, feet, head, liver, heart and dressed yield as the percent of the liveweight. The hen were tested for egg production up to 72 weeks of age and traits such as egg number, body weight at 20, 30, 36, 42, and 72 weeks, shank length at 20, 30 and 42 weeks, egg quality, survival age, age at sexual maturity, feed intake and abdominal fat were measured. First generation chicks were then produced by mating the parent generation using artificial insemination to produce a stock which comprised of eight genotype groups (DlNN; DLNO; LDNN; LDNO, LONN; LONO; DANN; and DANO). The cockerels were subjected to fattening test and egg production of pullets was recorded following the procedure as in the parent generation. Results from fattening test in the parent generation indicated that the Dahlem both normal feathered and naked neck had higher body weight at hatch than the local fowl. At 12 weeks of age, the Dahlem naked naked neck males had higher body weight dressed percentage than the Dahlem normal feathered and the indigenous fowl (normal feathered). Traits such as gizzard, head, liver and heart percentage were unimportant since no significant difference were observed among the three-genotype groups. Results from laying test (Parent generation) indicated that the Dahlem Red both naked neck and normal feathered laid eggs than the indigenous fowl. The Dahlem (both naked neck and normal feathered) had higher feed intake and feed efficiency than the indigenous chicken. Indigenous fowl <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>lay</b> (Sexual maturity) later than the Dahlem birds but had lower mortality and higher yolk percentage. Eggs of Dahlem layer had higher albumen and yolk height {{than that of the}} local fowl. No differences were observed among genotypes for yolk colour, shell percentage and egg breaking strength. Indigenous hens had higher abdominal fat percentage than the Dahlem hens. Results on body weight in the first generation, revealed that Dahlem naked neck chicks had body weight at hatching. Local x Dahlem naked neck crossbreds had highest 12 weeks body weight and carcass yield. Heterosis for 12 weeks body weight was positive in both naked neck and normal feathered type. Local x Dahlem crossbreds, both normal feathered and naked neck types had higher 12 weeks body weight than its reciprocal cross. Results on egg production performance (G 1) revealed that local x Dahlem crossbreds produced highest number of eggs (233 eggs) than local naked neck (142 eggs). Dahlem normal feathered hens produced higher egg mass (12. 8 kg) than local naked neck hens (6. 7 kg). Highest feed consumption was observed for in the Dahlem normal feathered genotype group (0. 27) and it was lowest for local naked neck genotype group (0. 16). Crossbreds attained earkier sexual maturity than the pure breeds. Positive heterosis was observed for egg number and egg mass in both naked neck and normal feathered genotypes. Normal feathered local x Dahlem crossbreds produced higher egg number than its reciprocal cross but it was reverse for the naked neck type. Similar pattern was observed for egg mass also. Difference in feed efficiency was not found between reciprocal crosses of normal feathered types while local x Dahlem crossbred had higher feed efficiency among the naked neck type. An appreciable improvement in body weight and egg production traits was observed on crossing ICF with German Dahlem Red. Positive heterosis was observed for body weight in cockerels, egg number and egg mass. Reciprocal effects were variable between the normal feathered and naked neck genotypes for most of the traits. Effect of necked neck gene was consistent in improving body weight, carcass yield and egg weight...|$|R
