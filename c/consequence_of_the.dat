5|$|Utmost {{necessity}} may {{be invoked}} where an interest {{protected by the}} Criminal Code (such as right to property or right to life) is endangered. An example of necessity would be a defense against a raging dog (unless the dog was directly sent by the owner, which would be case of necessary defense). The necessity may be invoked only in case of imminent danger and only {{if there is no}} other way of avoiding it (subsidiarity), such as locking oneself behind a fence or calling the police. Also, the <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> necessity must be less serious than the <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> endangering act (proportionality).|$|E
5|$|Among the colonies, news of {{the attack}} led to {{rejection}} of British authority {{and the establishment of}} independent governments.

5|$|Following an 1866 {{conflict}} between the increasingly authoritarian Cuza and the political class, various trends organized a coup which brought Prince Carol, a Hohenzollern, to the Romanian throne—echoing a will expressed {{by some of the}} 1848 activists to have a foreign dynasty rule over a unified state. In 1877, as a <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russo-Turkish War, Romania proclaimed her independence.|$|E
5|$|Historically, auls were a Circassian type {{of rural}} locality.

These auls tend to be located in mountainous or {{otherwise}} difficult-to-access terrains, while most of those established after the Caucasian War are found on the plains beside the Caucasus Mountains.|$|E

5|$|In {{everyday}} life, {{there are}} three familiar dimensions of space: height, width and depth. Einstein's {{general theory of relativity}} treats time as a dimension on par with the three spatial dimensions; in general relativity, space and time are not modeled as separate entities but are instead unified to a four-dimensional spacetime, three spatial dimensions and one time dimension. In this framework, the phenomenon of gravity is viewed as a <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geometry of spacetime.|$|E
5|$|One final <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> raid {{was that}} the Telecommunications Research Establishment, {{where much of the}} Bruneval {{equipment}} was analysed, and British radar systems were designed and tested, was moved further inland from Swanage on the southern coast of England to Malvern to ensure that it was not the target of a reprisal raid by German airborne forces.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{historically}} contentious views within Jainism {{is in part}} attributed to Mahavira and his ascetic life where he never wore any clothes as a mark of disowning everything (interpreted as a <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fifth vow of Aparigraha). The disputes triggered by this teaching of Mahavira are those related to gender and whether a female mendicant (sadhvi) can achieve spiritual liberation just like a male mendicant (sadhu) through Jain ascetic practices.|$|E
