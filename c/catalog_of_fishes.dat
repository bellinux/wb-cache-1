5000|$|José Luis Castro Aguirre (24 June 1943 - 20 January 2011) was a Mexican ichthyologist. He was a {{founding}} member of the Mexican Ichthyological Society and a member of the National System of Investigators who produced around 150 publications, focusing chiefly on the taxonomy, ecology, and biogeography <b>of</b> the <b>fishes</b> <b>of</b> Mexico. His 1978 book Catálogo sistemático de los peces marinos que penetran en aguas continentales de México, con aspectos zoogeográficos y ecológicos ("Systematic <b>catalog</b> <b>of</b> marine <b>fish</b> entering inland waters of Mexico, with zoogeographical and ecological aspects") was the first <b>catalog</b> <b>of</b> estuarine <b>fishes</b> <b>of</b> Mexico. Born in Mexico City, he attended the National School of Biological Sciences at the National Polytechnic Institute (ENCB-IPN) earning a master's degree in 1974 and a PhD in 1986. He worked at the National Fisheries Institute and the Food and Agriculture Organization in the 1960s, and later was professor and researcher at the ENCB-IPN, Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana (UAM; 1979-1987), the Interdisciplinary Center of Marine Science (CICIMAR; 1976-1979, 1994-2011) and Northeast Center of Biological Research (CIBNOR; 1987-1994). He described around a dozen fish species, including several species of shark. A book of research papers in his honor was produced in 2012, and he was posthumously commemorated in the names <b>of</b> the <b>fish</b> species Hypoplectrus castroaguirrei (a hamlet) [...] and Eugerres castroaguirrei (a mojarra).|$|R
40|$|Diablo Cove, {{a future}} warm water {{discharge}} site, is located about midpoint of a 13 mile long rocky shoreside reef in central California. The reef, physically isolated from other similar coastal areas, supports important kelp bed communities of nonmigratory vertebrates and invertebrates {{that must be}} constantly monitored to ensure they are protected. This 2 year study is a base line inventory done {{in the vicinity of}} Diablo Cove with major emphasis on abalones, including their food chain, and bony fishes. Data was obtained on the life history and annual canopy development of the kelp Nereocystis and all macroalgae were <b>cataloged.</b> Seasonal collections <b>of</b> <b>fishes</b> were made to document those species indigenous to the system and to obtain life history information on the common forms.

40|$|The <b>Fish</b> Collection <b>of</b> the Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS) {{dates back}} to the late 1800 s and the {{extensive}} surveys <b>of</b> Illinois <b>fishes</b> led by Dr. Stephen A. Forbes, director of the Survey's predecessor, the Illinois State Laboratory of Natural History (ISLNH). From 1876 to 1903 Forbes, assisted by his esteemed colleague Robert E. Richardson and numerous field and laboratory personnel, collected and preserved over 200, 000 specimens from more than 450 localities distributed in 93 of the 102 counties of Illinois. During this time, the ISLNH Collection served as the basis for several <b>catalogs</b> <b>of</b> Illinois <b>fishes</b> (Nelson 1876; Jordan 1878 a; Forbes 1884; Large 1903), and provided material for the description of at least 25 species. This work culminated in the classic <b>Fishes</b> <b>of</b> Illinois written by Forbes and Richardson, published by the Survey in 1909 and reprinted in 1920 (although no publication date is given for the original volume, H. C. Oesterling, former INHS editor, lists the date as 1909 in Howard 1932 : 46). Accompanied by a separate atlas of distribution maps of 98 species, this comprehensive treatment of the state's ichthyofauna still is {{recognized as one of the}} finest publications on fishes. The INHS Fish Collection was expanded by Dr. Philip W. Smith, who worked as a systematic biologist at the Survey from 1942 until his retirement in 1979 (Burr and Page 1987). Over a period of 1 1 years from 1962 to 1972, Smith assembled a large collection <b>of</b> <b>fishes</b> from Illinois and neighboring states. The ichthyological surveys conducted by Smith, his students, and INHS staff led to the publication <b>of</b> a second <b>Fishes</b> <b>of</b> Illinois (Smith 1979). Smith's monograph provided identification keys, information on the ecology and taxonomy <b>of</b> Illinois <b>fishes,</b> and detailed distribution maps that documented changes in the state's fish fauna that had occurred since the survey of Forbes and Richardson. The size and geographic scope of the INHS collection have been considerably expanded in the past three decades; the collection now contains about 7 1 1, 000 cataloged specimens (over 7 1, 000 lots) of more than 1, 800 species. A recent literature survey identified over 250 publications citing the use of INHS specimens over the past 40 years. Included are two publications that have greatly advanced both the professional and popular understanding of North American fishes: the Handbook of Darters (Page 1983) and A Field Guide to Freshwater <b>Fishes</b> <b>of</b> North America North of Mexico (Page and Burr 1991). published or submitted for publicationis peer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|The Honey Lake Wildlife Area (HLWA) is a California Department <b>of</b> <b>Fish</b> and Game {{protected}} area wetland of 7667 acres {{at the mouth}} of the Susan River on the north shore of Honey Lake which has numerous bird species.

The state issued a special series of text-only season-long waterfowl hunting permit stamps for the area, starting with the 1956-57 season and ending with the 1985-86 season.
