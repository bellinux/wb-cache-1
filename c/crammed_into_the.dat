In May, Hartmann filed claims number 208 to 231 which included six on the 6 May. On 8 May 1944, JG52 fled {{the region as}} the German defence collapsed. Hartmann flew out with two mechanics <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fuselage of his Bf109.

5|$|One hundred {{thousand}} {{soldiers on the}} high seas in a multitude of transports converged on Gibraltar. More than 400 aircraft of all types were <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dispersal areas around the Gibraltar runway. Fighters had been shipped in crates and assembled on the airfield. Every available area of storage was taken up with ammunition, fuel, and other essential supplies. 168 American pilots were housed in the RAF messes at North Front.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19thcentury the {{population}} of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. Despite this rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately , spread across around 200 small sites. The difficulty of digging without disturbing existing graves led to bodies often simply being stacked on top of each other to fit the available space and covered with a layer of earth. In more crowded areas even relatively fresh graves had to be exhumed to free up space for new burials, their contents being unearthed and scattered to free up space. In some cases large pits were dug on existing burial grounds, unearthing the previous burials, and fresh corpses <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> available space. Intact material from burials was sold on a thriving market in second hand coffin furniture, coffin wood was burned as household fuel, and exhumed bones were shipped in bulk to the north of England to be sold as fertiliser. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid; in 1842 the mean working life of a London professional man was 30 years and of a London labourer just 17 years.|$|E
50|$|The trial, at its time, was as notorious as the O.J. Simpson {{trial was}} in the 1990s and was {{accompanied}} by a media circus akin to such trials today. A reputed 8,000 people tried to <b>cram</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> church for the funeral and Cunningham reportedly threw herself dramatically on Burdell's casket.|$|R
50|$|Game II {{was played}} on a cold and wet night that saw almost 30,000 <b>cram</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Sydney Cricket Ground, {{signalling}} that the New South Wales public had finally embraced the Origin concept. The mud, rain and tolerant eye of referee Barry Gomersall combined to form an explosive mix. Progress was arduous in the SCG quagmire and handling almost impossible.|$|R

It appears she had only charged for damage to the bicycle, not for the entire machine which Mr. Lingnam was ruthlessly gleaning, spoke by spoke, from <b>the</b> highway and <b>cramming</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> slack of the hood. At last he answered, and I {{have never seen a}} man foam at the mouth before. 'If you don't stop, I shall come into your house--in this car--and drive upstairs and--kill you!' ...|$|R
25|$|Britain again won the Ashes in 1932. In 1932 {{the police}} locked the SCG gates after 70,204 <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> SCG. This would remain {{the world record}} test match {{attendance}} until eclipsed by the 73,631 who attended the 1992 World Cup Final at Wembley Stadium.|$|E
25|$|As more {{blind people}} are <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> prison, {{overcrowding}} {{and lack of}} outside support causes hygiene and living conditions to degrade. Soon, the walls and floors are caked in filth and human feces. Anxiety over the availability of food undermines the morale {{and the lack of}} organization prevents the fair distribution of food. The soldiers who guard the asylum become hostile.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, {{at a time}} {{of growing}} {{ambition}} for the club, terracing was cut into the cinder banking of the Kop and further earth removal from the Cross Street to Saltergate end was undertaken to level the pitch.

50|$|In May 2008, WJSC was uprooted once again. <b>Cramming</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hot and window-less {{transmitter}} room in {{the attic}} of Dibden, WJSC went on auto-pilot for 8 months while construction {{took place on the}} Stearns Student Center. The result was well worth the wait as the station received much recognition from the administration and was given the “best spot in the building” to house our new studio, as well as a full technological makeover; bringing WJSC on-par with commercial radio stations of the 21st century.|$|R

Not entirely; for, to the last, he would <b>cram</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> satchel sacred to literature any odds and ends of rubbish that he couldn't find a handy place for elsewhere. When threatened with death for this, it did not trouble him; he only looked pleasant, saluted with soldierly grace, said [...] "Wair good," [...] and did it again next day.|$|R

25|$|Through {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s a {{sustained}} period of aircraft hijackings between Cuba and the U.S. by citizens of both nations {{led to a}} need for cooperation. By 1974, U.S. elected officials had begun to visit the island. Three years later, during the Carter administration, the U.S. and Cuba simultaneously opened interests sections in each other's capitals. In 1980, after 10,000 Cubans <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Peruvian embassy seeking political asylum, Castro stated that any who wished to do so could leave Cuba, in {{what became known as}} the Mariel boatlift. Approximately 125,000 people left Cuba for the United States.|$|E
25|$|The record {{attendance}} for an SANFL fixture {{was set at}} the 1976 SANFL Grand Final between Sturt and Port Adelaide at Football Park {{which saw}} 66,987 <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stadium, though some estimate the crowd to have been as high as 80,000 with thousands turned away at the gates. The largest attendance for a minor round fixture was set in Round 19, 1988 for a double header at Football Park. 38,213 fans saw Sturt play Port Adelaide in the early game while reigning premiers North Adelaide faced ladder leaders Central District in the late game. The record suburban ground attendance was an estimated 24,000 who saw Sturt and Norwood at Unley Oval on 9 June 1924. A verified attendance of 22,738 saw Port play Norwood at Alberton in Round 11, 1977*.|$|E
500|$|The {{designers}} of dreadnoughts sought to provide as much protection, speed, and firepower {{as possible in}} a ship of a realistic size and cost. The hallmark of dreadnought battleships was an [...] "all-big-gun" [...] armament, but they also had heavy armour concentrated mainly in a thick belt at the waterline and {{in one or more}} armoured decks. Secondary armament, fire control, command equipment, and protection against torpedoes also had to be <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hull.|$|E
5000|$|The genus name Ambystoma {{was given}} by Johann Jakob von Tschudi in 1839, and is {{traditionally}} translated as [...] "cup-mouth",. Tschudi did not provide a derviation for the name, and many thought that he intended the name Amblystoma, [...] "blunt-mouth." [...] Occasionally, old specimens and documents use the name Amblystoma. Writing in 1907, Leonhard Stejneger offered a derivation of Ambystoma based on the contraction of a Greek phrase meaning [...] "to <b>cram</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mouth," [...] but others have not found this explanation convincing. [...] In the absence of clear evidence that Tschudi committed a lapsus, the name given in 1839 stands.|$|R

25|$|By 1902 Regents Field {{had grown}} {{inadequate}} for {{the uses of}} the football team {{as a result of}} the sport's increasing popularity. Thanks to donations from Dexter M. Ferry, work began on planning the next home stadium for the Michigan football team. Powered by a $30,000 donation from Ferry, Ferry Field was constructed with a maximum temporary capacity of 18,000 for the 1906 season. Ferry Field was expanded to a capacity of 21,000 in 1914 and 42,000 in 1921. However, attendance was often over-capacity with crowds of 48,000 <b>cramming</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> small stadium. This prompted athletic director Fielding Yost to contemplate the construction of a much larger stadium.|$|R
500|$|According to Nyiszli, [...] "Eight {{hundred to}} a {{thousand}} people were <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> superimposed compartments of each barracks. Unable to stretch out completely, they slept there both lengthwise and crosswise, with one man's feet on another's head, neck, or chest. Stripped of all human dignity, they pushed and shoved and bit and kicked each other {{in an effort to}} get a few more inches' space on which to sleep a little more comfortably. For they did not have long to sleep".|$|E
500|$|The {{parchment}} used in {{the manuscript}} is of the lowest quality, and the text is written untidily, {{with an eye to}} economical use of space; it is laid out in continuous lines like prose, with words and lines close together, and with various additions and corrections, new exegesis, and allegorical readings, <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> corners of the margins (as {{can be seen in the}} reproduction above). Robert Burchfield argues that these indications [...] "suggest that it was a 'workshop' draft which the author intended to have recopied by a professional scribe" [...] (Burchfield 1987, p.280).|$|E
500|$|... "Stairmageddon" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics, with praise {{going to the}} drama in the Jim-Pam storyline, while the zaniness of other storylines received more mixed opinions. The A.V. Club reviewer Erik Adams complimented the drama between Jim and Pam, writing that it has [...] "been given {{just the right amount}} of weight". He criticized the episode for being [...] "one of the loudest tonal clashes in the history of The Office", comparing it negatively to the previous episode, [...] "Promos". He said that the other storylines seemed <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> episode, particularly due to the writers' decision to flesh out the supporting cast. Adams gave the episode a C. M.

50|$|Well, {{geography}} {{is about the}} world around you so I {{spend a lot of}} time staring out of my window! In between staring, I get information from books, TV programmes, magazines and the internet. I am also a member of the Royal Geographical Society (with Institute of British Geographers) in London. It's where all the great geographical expeditions of the past set out from. They have a fantastic library and lots of things belonging to explorers like Captain Scott (included stuffed penguins) and David Livingstone (including his diary, boots etc). The trouble is, finding out about deserts or poles etc is so fascinating, I tend to get carried away and do far more research than I can <b>cram</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> book.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the Rufus on {{the cruiser}} {{has been working}} with Cletus, (whom he {{mistakes}} for one of the other Rufus clones).

At the headquarters, Rufus is mourning the death of the other Rufus. Seagull prepares to kill Rufus when the Rufus riding Opperbot crashes into him killing them both. The last remaining Rufus reunites with Goal and apologizes to her and everyone for having doomed them all. However, Goal convinces everyone to give Rufus another chance pointing out it's thanks to him Deponia has not yet been destroyed. The resistance looks to Rufus for one last crazy idea. Rufus decides they will all <b>cram</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> vehicle inside the cannon and fire it at the cruiser.|$|R
500|$|Ellen's {{body was}} {{examined}} by five physicians: police surgeon Charles Templeman, his colleague Alexander Stalker, Edinburgh surgeon Henry Littlejohn and two local doctors, David Lennox and William Kinnear. They concluded that Ellen had been strangled from behind. Her right leg was broken {{in two places}} {{so it could be}} <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> crate. Incisions, made by the penknife, ran downwards along her abdomen and had been made [...] "within at most ten minutes of the time of death" [...] according to Templeman, Stalker and Littlejohn. Lennox disagreed and thought the wounds were made later on the basis that when he examined the body the wound was not everted, but Templeman and Stalker said the wound was everted when they examined the body. Littlejohn explained that as Lennox made his examination three days after the others, the shape of the wounds could have changed, to which Lennox agreed.|$|E
500|$|An {{enthusiastic}} {{fan base}} supporting California Chrome became visible at the Santa Anita Derby, when someone invited the horse's supporters {{to join the}} owners in the winner's circle and over 100 people <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> area, including one woman dressed entirely in metallic foil. [...] Coburn told CNN of a supporter who had a jackass tattooed on his shoulder. An unofficial Twitter account for the horse, @CalChrome, was started by a 37-year-old fan from Florida, Shawn LaFata, had over 12,000 followers by Belmont week. The New York Times noted the enthusiasm of the fans, who used the hashtag #Chromies on Twitter. LaFata believes the word [...] "Chromies" [...] first appeared on @CalChrome eight nights before the Kentucky Derby. The humble origins of the horse and {{the people around him}} played a role in his popularity, as did the horse's people-focused attitude. Supporters appeared to be further motivated by the continuing doubts raised by industry experts about California Chrome's ability.|$|E
500|$|The revamped show in 2014 {{received}} acclaim by critics. Isabel Mohan from The Daily Telegraph acclaimed the revamped show {{praising the}} singer's sex appeal {{and noted that}} although the set included many new songs, the singer [...] "remained strikingly composed and confident throughout a show which proved her talent, charisma and awe-inspiring thighs". Sidney Madden who praised the upgraded set list further commended the show's fashion. Digital Spy's Robert Copsey felt that the show's set list {{was better than the}} original one describing the tour as [...] "wall-to-wall amazing Beyoncé". He concluded in his review, [...] "The relentless pace, ever-changing visuals and sheer amount of songs <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> set is a lot to take in, let alone the fact that Beyoncé delivers the entire thing with power yet impeccable ease. When it comes to putting on a show of this calibre, these days she's really only competing with herself." [...] The Observers Kitty Empire praised the singer's ranuchiness during the tour different from the other performers and concluded by writing, [...] "There is no question as to Beyoncé's own powers. She can stop and start her all-female band... with a click of her fingers, and keep climbing octaves until you think her lungs are about to jump out of her chest. She sings (with a range that only gets wider and deeper with every tour) and dances (flawlessly) for more than one and a half hours." [...] David Pollock of The Independent felt that, [...] "this near two-hour epic is a ferocious distillation of musical styles old and new and a stunning declaration of intent that Knowles intends to be recognised as the defining pop artist of her era. It was, at the very least, one of the hardest working shows likely to be witnessed on a stage this year, and with barely a drop of minutely-choreographed sweat to be seen." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1943, after the German {{invasion}} of the Dodecanese, the Germans had to transfer {{tens of thousands of}} Italian prisoners over the sea.

Several ships sank, by allied attack or by accident, causing the death of thousands of prisoners.|$|R
50|$|People {{had started}} queuing a good {{hour before the}} shuttle buses started running from 4:25pm. The gates opened at 5.00pm, {{and by that time}} some people had already been queuing {{for an hour and a}} half. At an hour before kick off there were already an {{estimated}} 60,000 in the ground. The traffic on the roads in the surrounding area was at a standstill as more and more spectators converged on the stadium. Some squatted around the pitch, while others climbed onto rooftops for a better view. Fences around the ground had collapsed, as more people struggled to <b>cram</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bowl of Odsal before kick-off. The official figure for the crowd at the match was 102,575, easily the biggest number to see a rugby football match of either code. However it is widely believed that the real figure for spectators present is closer to 120,000.|$|R
2500|$|Other sources {{state that}} it was the old and sick who were called upon to report in the first action; the date was July 27, 1941. Thousands of people were <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> small old fortress, with only two water taps, almost no {{sanitary}} facilities, and no food. Many people were naturally anxious to leave. [...] A column of 2,000 people was quickly formed up, and marched out under the guard of Latvian auxiliary police. A few days later, possibly on August 6, a similar offer was extended to all parents with small children, with similar results.|$|E
2500|$|The English laid siege to St. Augustine in November 1702. About 1,500 town {{residents}} and soldiers were <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fort during the two-month siege.

The siege was broken when the Spanish fleet from Havana arrived, trapping some English vessels in the bay. The English were defeated and decided to burn their ships to prevent them from falling under Spanish control, and then marched overland back to Carolina. The town of St. Augustine was destroyed, in part by the Spanish and in part by the English, as a result of the siege.|$|E
2500|$|Football {{served as}} a {{distraction}} for people {{on the home front}} during the war, particularly during the darkest days between 1941 and 1943. The Australian government requisitioned a number of VFL grounds, including the MCG. Therefore, the grand final was staged at Princes Park (Carlton) in 1942, 1943 and 1945, and at St Kilda's Junction Oval in 1944 when Fitzroy won its last premiership on the second hottest grand final day on record. The 1943 clash was a thrilling contest, Richmond defeating Essendon by five points. The 1942 and 1945 matches were marred by violence, and the latter game has gone down in history as [...] "the [...] "Bloodbath". An amazing crowd of 62,986 <b>crammed</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Carlton ground for this game, which was played just weeks after the armistice with Japan was declared.|$|E

[...] Molly Freeman of Screenrant praised the episode and overall the sixth season, by saying, [...] "All in all, ‘Glued, Where’s My Bob?’ is an excellent cap to a season of Bob’s Burgers as well as its milestone 100th episode (though, that’s according to production codes, while it’s the 107th episode to have aired). Altogether season 6 of Bob’s Burgers maintained the balance of comedy and heart that has made the series so popular among fans." ...|$|R
