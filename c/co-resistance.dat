40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{prevalence}} of the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) -producing enterobacteria (ESBLE) in the French community, during a 2006 survey. METHODS: All enterobacteria isolated from urine samples of patients, exhibiting a decreased susceptibility to broad-spectrum cephalosporins, were analysed for their beta-lactamase content (synergy test, isoelectrofocusing, conjugation transfer, PCR amplification and/or cloning experiments and sequencing). Additional <b>co-resistances</b> were investigated by PCR, sequencing and/or cloning. Epidemiological relationship was studied by PFGE for all species and, in addition, for Escherichia coli by the determination of the phylogenetic group, multilocus sequence type (ST) and O 25 b antigen. Characteristics of CTX-M-producing E. coli carriers were compared with other ESBLE carriers. RESULTS: Seventy-two ESBLE were collected from 71 patients. Most of them expressed a CTX-M enzyme (n = 42, comprising 40 E. coli), with a predominance of CTX-M- 15 (n = 24); 10 CTX-M- 15 -producing E. coli belonged to the same clone (phylogroup B 2, ST 131, serotype O 25 b). The 30 remaining strains possessed a TEM- or SHV-type ESBL. In addition, three strains presented unusual <b>co-resistances</b> such as DHA- 1 (n = 2), QnrB 4 and ArmA. Risk factors for ESBLE acquisition were substantially less frequent when the ESBL was of the CTX-M type, except for prior antimicrobial therapy. Eighteen percent of the patients were considered to have true community-acquired ESBLE; most of them harboured a CTX-M-producing E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: This first nationwide study reports an ESBLE prevalence of 1. 1 % in the French community setting in 2006, mainly related to the presence of CTX-M-producing E. coli strains; furthermore, unusual <b>co-resistances</b> rarely found in the community setting were occasionally observed, which may threaten future emergence...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} facing health professionals is the prevalence of antibiotic resistance. Most Gram-negative bacteria produce beta-lactamases which are enzymes that in-activate β-lactams. Recent publications suggested that extended spectrum beta-lactamase production in E. coli and K. pneumoniae {{is one of the}} main causes of antimicrobial resistance in penicillins, cephalosporins and some non-beta-lactam antibiotics in Accra. This present work sought to determine the resistance profile of antimicrobials to non-ESBL-producing isolates in Accra. The 400 K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates were screened for non-ESBL-producing strains using the combined disk method. The minimum inhibition concentration for 17 antibiotics was determined using Vitek 2 Compact System (bioMérieux, Marcy I’Etoile, France). Among the 400 total bacterial isolates, 198 (49. 5 %) were non-ESBL producers. <b>Co-resistances</b> to ampicillin (66. 7 %), piperacillin (59. 1 %), tetracycline (77. 8 %) and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (68. 2 %) have been collaborated in this work. The increasing rise in resistance to the beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination antibiotics such as amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (13. 6 %) and piperacillin/tazobactam (18. 7 %) is problematic since they have become the empirical drug of choice for treating most infections. The steady increase in resistance to gentamicin (17. 2 %) as well as the floroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin (39. 4 %) and norfloxacin (34. 9 %) is alarming.

40|$|Background: One {{third of}} {{travellers}} {{to the poor}} regions of the (sub) tropics become colonized by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE). <b>Co-resistance</b> to non-betalactam antibiotics complicates the treatment of potential ESBL-PE infections. Methods: We analysed <b>co-resistance</b> to non-beta-lactams among travel-acquired ESBL-PE isolates of 90 visitors to the (sub) tropics with respect to major risk factors of colonization: destination, age, travellers' diarrhoea (TD) and antibiotic (AB) use. Results: Of the ESBL-PE isolates, 53 %, 52 %, 73 %, and 2 % proved co-resistant to ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, co-trimoxazole, and nitrofurantoin, respectively. The rates were similar among those with (TD+) or without (TD-) travellers' diarrhoea. Among fluoroquinolone-users vs. AB non-users, the <b>co-resistance</b> rates for ciprofloxacin were 95 % versus 37 % (p = 0. 001), for tobramycin 85 % versus 43 % (p = 0. 005), co-trimoxazole 85 % versus 68 % (p = 0. 146), and nitrofurantoin 5 % versus 2 % (p = 0. 147). In multivariable analysis <b>co-resistance</b> to ciprofloxacin was associated with increasing age, fluoroquinolone use, and tobramycin resistance.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed an age-structured population model for S. pneumoniae transmission in a human community exposed to heptavalent vaccine, and beta-lactams, macrolides and ketolides. The dynamics of intra-individual selection of resistant strains under antibiotic exposure and interindividual transmission were simulated, with antibiotic-specific resistance mechanisms defining the path to <b>co-resistances</b> and cross-resistances, and parameters concerning the French situation. Results of this simulation study suggest that new antibiotic consumption could markedly slow the diffusion of multiresistant strains. Wider use was associated with slower progression of multiresistance. When ketolides were prescribed to all ages, resistance to them reached 10 % after > 15 years, while it took > 40 years when they were prescribed only to adults. In the scenario according to which new antibiotics totally replaced former antimicrobials, the beta-lactam resistance rate was limited at 70 %.

Expected randomly distributed resistance covariation was compared with observed <b>co-resistance</b> among gram-negative enteric bacteria in 92 paediatric blood culture isolates that had been harvested in the same hospital {{during the same period}} of time. Mortality was fivefold increased among patients with positive blood culture results [50. 0 % vs. 9. 8 %; OR 11. 24 (4. 38 - 25. 88), p < 0. 0001], and for this group of patients mortality was significantly associated with antimicrobial resistance [OR 23. 28 (3. 3 - 164. 4), p = 0. 002]. All 11 patients with Enterobacteriaceae resistant to 3 rd. generation cephalosporins died. Eighty-nine patients had pancytopenia grade 3 - 4. Among patients with negative blood culture results, mortality was significantly associated with pancytopenia [OR 3. 12 (1. 32 - 7. 39), p = 0. 01].

However, 50  % of advanced ER-positive cancers display de novo resistance to tamoxifen, and acquired resistance evolves in 40  % of patients who initially respond. Mechanisms underlying resistance development remain poorly understood and new therapeutic opportunities are urgently needed. Here, we report the generation and characterization of seven tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cell lines from four parental strains. Methods Using high throughput drug sensitivity and resistance testing (DSRT) with 279 approved and investigational oncology drugs, exome-sequencing and network analysis, we for the first time, systematically determine the drug response profiles specific to tamoxifen resistance. Results We discovered emerging vulnerabilities towards specific drugs, such as ERK 1 / 2 -, proteasome- and BCL-family inhibitors as the cells became tamoxifen-resistant. <b>Co-resistance</b> to other drugs such as the survivin inhibitor YM 155 and the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel also occurred. Conclusion This study indicates that multiple molecular mechanisms dictate endocrine resistance, resulting in unexpected vulnerabilities to initially ineffective drugs, as well as in emerging co-resistances.

All susceptibility test results for Mannheimia haemolytica recovered from lung tissues of cattle were eligible for inclusion in the survey. There were no isolates over the course of the analysis that were resistant to all 6 antimicrobials, primarily due to a lack of resistance to ceftiofur.

The aims of this thesis were to investigate and evaluate the susceptibility of isolates of S. epidermidis from various infections to chlorhexidine (CHX) and to other disinfectants such as benzalkonium chloride (BKC), triclosan (TLN) and povidone-iodine (PI). In addition, the mechanisms of resistance of S. epidermidis to chlorhexidine (the original isolates and strains adapted to chlorhexidine by serial passage) were examined and <b>co-resistance</b> to clinically relevant antibiotics investigated. In 3 of the 11 S. epidermidis strains passaged in increasing concentrations of chlorhexidine, resistance to the disinfectant arose (16 -fold).

Beside the gene linkage phenomenon of metal and antibiotic resistance on transferable elements which was found several decades ago, multidrug resistance (MDR) pump was another important mechanism explored afterwards (Foster 1983). Plasmids from Salmonella abortus equi contained resistances to ampicillin and several metals (Ghosh et al. 2000), the copper and macrolide resistance plasmid (tcrB-ermB) was found in Enterococcus faecium (Aarestrup et al. 2002; Hasman and Aarestrup 2002).

Methods The susceptibilities to amphotericin B and fluconazole of Candida species collected in 1999 and 2002 of the Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance of Yeasts (TSARY) were determined by the microdilution method. Results The antifungal susceptibilities of 342 and 456 isolates collected from 11 hospitals participating in both TSARY 1999 and TSARY 2002, respectively, have been determined. The resistance rate to amphotericin B has increased from 0. 3 % in the TSARY 1999 to 2. 2 % in the TSARY 2002. In contrast, the resistance rate to fluconazole has decreased from 8. 8 % to 2. 2 %. Nevertheless, significantly more C. glabrata isolates were not susceptible to fluconazole in the TSARY 2002 (47. 4 %) than that in the TSARY 1999 (20. 8 %).

Current rates of <b>co-resistance</b> in hospital-acquired ESBL-PE are 50 – 60 % for gentamicin and 10 – 20 % to amikacin [81, 82], although local variations are observed. Methylases of the 16 S ribosomal subunit (i.e., {{the target of}} aminoglycosides) have been more recently described, notably in NDM-producing strains [83]: these enzymes, named ArmA and Rmt, confer resistance to all aminoglycosides except neomycin.|$|E
40|$|Viomycin-resistant strains {{isolated}} from Mycobacterium smegmatis demonstrated pleiotropic resistance to tuberactinomycin-N, capreomycin, streptomycin, and kanamycin {{as a result}} of mutational alteration of ribosomes, even though they were selected for resistance to a single antibiotic. The pleiotropic drug resistance of three mutants isolated by stepwise selection for resistance to viomycin was due to alteration of the 30 S ribosomal subunit. One mutant, strain A, isolated independently by multiple-step selection to viomycin resistance, was resistant to viomycin, tuberactinomycin-N, and capreomycin through an alteration of the 50 S ribosomal subunit, whereas it was sensitive to kanamycin but resistant to streptomycin through an alteration of the 30 S ribosomal subunit. Three streptomycin-resistant strains, which were isolated by one-step selection at a high concentration of streptomycin, did not show significant <b>co-resistance</b> to any other antibiotics tested in culture and cell-free systems; streptomycin resistance in these mutants was localized on the 30 S ribosomal subunit...|$|E
40|$|AbstractResistance to broad-spectrum beta-lactams, {{mediated}} by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase enzymes (ESBL), {{is an increasing}} problem worldwide. The present study was undertaken to determine the incidence of ESBL-production among the clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and their susceptibility to selected antimicrobials. A total of one eighty-seven clinical specimens were tested {{for the presence of}} ESBL production using the double-disc synergy test. Of these, 25. 13 % (n= 47) isolates of P. aeruginosa were observed as ESBL positive. The maximum number of ESBL-producing strains were found in sputum (41. 67 %; n= 24) followed by pus (28. 36 %; n= 19), cerebrospinal fluid and other body fluids (21. 74 %; n= 5), urine (20. 45 %; n= 9) and blood (13. 79 %; n= 4). ESBL producing isolates exhibited <b>co-resistance</b> to an array of antibiotics tested. Imipenem and meropenem can be suggested as the drugs of choice in our study...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Background & Aims: One of {{the most}} common causes of {{bacterial}} resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics is beta-lactamase producing. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the antibiotic resistance of urinary Escherichia coli (E. coli) isolates producing CTX-M and TEM type beta-lactamases, and to determine the strains with <b>co-resistance</b> to multiple antibiotics in Mashhad, Iran. Methods: E. coli bacteria were isolated from urine samples of hospitalized patients referred to two selected hospitals in Mashhad, Iran, in 2010. The bacteria were identified by differential biochemical tests and confirmed using Microgene Kit tests. The antibiotic assay was performed by disk diffusion method. Double disk approximation and phenotypic confirmatory test were carried out for screening ESBLs. Plasmids of ESBL-producers were extracted. TEM and CTX-M type beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were identified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: The percentage of bacteria with blaCTX-M gene was more than blaTEM (97. 2...|$|E
40|$|Chancroid {{caused by}} Haemophilus ducreyi has been {{described}} as a significantly predisposing factor of HIV heterosexual transmission in an endemic region of both diseases. The fastidious, H. ducreyi has been reported world wide with various antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. A high tendency of drug resistances has generally been found among isolates derived in Thailand. In this study, the plasmids of H. ducreyi were isolated and analysed from 63 clinically derived organisms. Twenty-nine out of 63 isolates (46 %) revealed the same plasmid profiles. Plasmid DNA was further cloned into Escherichia coli and transformants were selected. A 3. 6 kb plasmid (pCb) carrying ampicillin resistance was subsequently identified. The pCb conferred resistance to various beta-lactam antibiotics including penicillin G, carbenicillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefoperazone, ampicillin-sulbactam, and amoxicillin-clavulanate but not to cefoxitin. <b>Co-resistance</b> to streptomycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline was not detected. Beta-lactamase gene was located on the major pCb fragment of EcoRI and AatII cutting...|$|E
40|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} is recognised {{as a major}} global threat to public health by the World Health Organization. Currently, several hundred thousand deaths yearly {{can be attributed to}} infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The major driver for the development of antibiotic {{resistance is}} considered to be the use, misuse and overuse of antibiotics in humans and animals. Nonantibiotic compounds, such as antibacterial biocides and metals, may also contribute to the promotion of antibiotic resistance through co-selection. This may occur when resistance genes to both antibiotics and metals/biocides are co-located together in the same cell (<b>co-resistance),</b> or a single resistance mechanism (e. g. an efflux pump) confers resistance to both antibiotics and biocides/metals (cross-resistance), leading to co-selection of bacterial strains, or mobile genetic elements that they carry. Here, we review antimicrobial metal resistance {{in the context of the}} antibiotic resistance problem, discuss co-selection, and highlight critical knowledge gaps in our understanding...|$|E
40|$|This {{study used}} {{statistical}} methods to investigate linkages in phenotypic resistance profiles {{in a population}} sample of 321 Salmonella Typhimurium isolates from sporadic salmonellosis cases in Lower Saxony, Germany, collected during 2008 – 2010. A resistance index was applied to calculate the conditional probability of resistance to one antimicrobial agent given the resistance {{to one or more}} other antimicrobial agent(s). A susceptibility index was defined analogously. A contingency plot, which visualizes the association between resistances to two antimicrobial agents, facilitated the interpretation. Linkages between minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were analysed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and jittered scatter plots. Applying these methods provided a compact description of multi-resistance and linkages between resistance properties in large datasets. Moreover, this approach will improve monitoring of antimicrobial resistance dynamics of bacteria in human or animal populations by identifying linked resistance to antimicrobial agents (cross- or <b>co-resistance)</b> with a non-molecular method...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} whether acquired resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) group molecules, being normal {{components of the}} human immune system, may select <b>co-resistance</b> to antibiotic peptides such as polymyxins, considering they share the same mechanism of action. We aimed to evaluate strains producing the recently identified plasmid-encoded polymyxin resistance determinant MCR- 1, which is a phosphoethanolamine transferase that modifies the lipopolysaccharide structure of Gram-negative bacteria. In vitro susceptibility studies were performed using human CAMPs, namely cathelicidin LL- 37, α-defensin 5 (HD 5), and β-defensin 3 (HDB 3), towards MCR- 1 -producing and colistin-resistant Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Cross-resistance to CAMPs and colistin mediated by MCR- 1 or chromosomal mechanisms was neither observed in E.  coli nor in K.  pneumoniae. Future therapeutic development of human CAMPs {{is not likely to}} be impeded by the spread of MCR- 1 plasmid-mediated resistance to polymyxins, at least in E.  coli...|$|E
40|$|A {{network of}} shared intermediates/components and/or common {{molecular}} outputs in biotic and abiotic stress signaling {{has long been}} known, but the possibility of effective influence between differently triggered stresses (co-protection) is less studied. Recent observations show that wounding induces transient protection in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) to four pathogens {{with a range of}} lifestyles, locally and systemically. The contribution of ethylene (ET) in basal but also in wound-induced resistance to each pathogen, although dispensable, is demonstrated to be positive (Botrytis cinerea, Phytophthora capsici) or negative (Fusarium oxysporum, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato). Furthermore, the expression of several defense markers is influenced locally and/or systemically by wounding and ET, and might be part of that core of conserved molecular responses whereby an abiotic stress such as wounding imparts <b>co-resistance</b> to biotic stress. In this addendum, we speculate on some of the physiological responses to wounding that might contribute to the modulation of resistance in a more pathogen-specific manner...|$|E
40|$|Bacteria {{employ a}} number of {{resistance}} mechanisms against antimicrobials, commonly including target site modification, antimicrobial degradation and active efflux. Of these mechanisms, efflux is unique in that a single efflux system can confer resistance to a remarkably broad range of structurally dissimilar antibiotics and biocides that have different intracellular targets and modes of action. For example, in the opportunistic pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii, single multidrug efflux systems facilitate the extrusion of agents as broad and diverse as quaternary ammonium compounds, intercalating dyes, diamidines, biguanidines, anionic detergents, aminoglycosides, ?-lactams, chloramphenicol, tetracyclines, trimethoprim and fluoroquinolones (Table 1). This promiscuity of substrates, coupled with the genetic linkage of exporter genes with other resistance determinants on transferable elements such as plasmids, raises the possibility of cross and <b>co-resistance</b> to biocides and antibiotics. Furthermore, data generated by our and other research groups clearly demonstrate a remarkable propensity of multidrug efflux systems to bind new substrates following only minor amino acid changes to their active sites. 4 page(s...|$|E
