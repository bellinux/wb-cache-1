50|$|The Postal Transportation Service (PTS) was the renamed {{successor}} to the Railway Mail Service of the United States Post Office Department from 1 October 1949. Although this branch of the service had {{been in charge of}} all transit mail, some parts {{had little to do with}} railroads, even though they were still the most important part of the service. In 1950, of the 32,000 clerks assigned to the PTS, only about 16,000 actually worked on trains. The remainder were in terminals, transfer offices, Air Mail Facility, Highway Post Offices (HPO), administrative offices, etc. Boat Railway Post Office (Boat RPO), Streetcar Railway Post Offices, and the Seapost Service had already been discontinued. The name of the <b>Chief</b> <b>Clerk's</b> <b>office</b> was changed to District Superintendent's office.|$|R

A central hallway (1.8 x 11.3 m) separated from the public area {{by a pair of}} timber doors leads {{to the rear of the}} building and provides access to four rooms, two on each side which are interconnected with doorways. In the hallway wall, a slot exists into the area behind the counter, most likely for the quick transmission of documents.

50|$|In 1872 Wakeford was {{transferred}} to the Colonial Office, leaving the responsibilities of the comptroller general's position to his <b>office's</b> <b>chief</b> <b>clerk,</b> W. B. Fauntleroy. Fauntleroy was confirmed as acting comptroller general later that year.In December 1877 the office of comptroller general was abolished, with Fauntleroy superannuated; his duties were passed on to the superintendent, John F. Stone, who was later appointed comptroller of convicts. With the transfer of Fremantle Prison to the colonial government in 1886, the role of the comptroller was replaced by that of the sheriff, responsible for all of the prisons in the colony. By the 1890s, the sheriff also held the post of inspector of prisons. The position of comptroller general was split off from the sheriff's office in early 1911, following the retirement of Sheriff Octavius Burt. In 1971, the Prisons Department was renamed the Department of Corrections, restructured, and the position of comptroller general was replaced with director of the department.|$|R
