50|$|In {{the initial}} service trial, {{broadband}} <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> <b>lines</b> initially linked Berlin to Leipzig. After {{a period of}} experimentation the system entered public use and was soon extended another 160 km (100 miles) from Berlin to Hamburg, and then in July 1938 from Leipzig to Nuremberg and Munich. The system eventually operated with more than 1,000 km (620 miles) of <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> transmission <b>lines.</b> The videophones were integrated within large public videophone booths, with two booths provided per city. Calls between Berlin and Leipzig cost RM3½, approximately one sixth of a British pound sterling, or about one-fifteenth of the average weekly wage. The video telephone equipment used in Berlin was designed and built by the German Post Office Laboratory. Videophone equipment used in other German cities were developed by Fernseh A.G., partly owned by Baird Television Ltd. of the U.K., inventors of the world's first functional television. During its life the German system underwent further development and testing, resulting in higher resolutions and a conversion to an all-electronic camera tube transmission system to replace its mechanical Nipkow scanning disc. While the system's image quality was primitive by modern standards, it was deemed impressive in contemporary reports of the era, with users able to clearly discern the hands on wristwatches.|$|R

An engineer was stationed there to activate the Oakland feed into the entire network when the game began, to cut it on instruction and then to return to his base. He had been told to expect at 6:58:20 Eastern Time a network announcement for Heidi, after which he was to cut the feed from Burbank, and the Heidi feed from New York would begin. This placed Burbank in effective control of whether the engineer would cut the feed, since he would act upon hearing the announcement.|$|R
5000|$|An {{addressable}} {{cable box}} {{is one that}} can be controlled by the local cable company. Addressability is the process by which (optionally encrypted) messages are sent from the cable provider for a particular cable box via the cable signal. The cable company can [...] "address" [...] a particular customer's cable box to command it to activate or deactivate the descrambling of selected premium or pay-per view channels. The system can also send messages. This function affords the cable company the ability to add or delete descrambling on the channels that come in through the <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> <b>line.</b> It also allows them to remotely disable the box, for reasons such as non-payment of the cable bill or theft of the unit itself. Such commands are referred to as bullets and are a transmitted message which affects the cable box program effectively disabling or [...] "killing" [...] it. [...] "Bullets" [...] do not affect the electronics inside converters or descramblers, only the programming. Non-addressable boxes are [...] "bulletproof", as they are unable to detect such messages.|$|R
5000|$|Despite being shielded, {{interference}} {{can occur}} on <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> <b>lines.</b> Susceptibility to interference has little relationship to broad cable type designations (e.g. RG-59, RG-6) but is {{strongly related to}} the composition and configuration of the cable's shielding. For cable television, with frequencies extending well into the UHF range, a foil shield is normally provided, and will provide total coverage as well as high effectiveness against high-frequency interference. Foil shielding is ordinarily accompanied by a tinned copper or aluminum braid shield, with anywhere from 60 to 95% coverage. The braid is important to shield effectiveness because (1) it {{is more effective than}} foil at preventing low-frequency interference, (2) it provides higher conductivity to ground than foil, and (3) it makes attaching a connector easier and more reliable. [...] "Quad-shield" [...] cable, using two low-coverage aluminum braid shields and two layers of foil, is often used in situations involving troublesome interference, but is less effective than a single layer of foil and single high-coverage copper braid shield such as is found on broadcast-quality precision video cable.|$|R

At the headend, the radio frequency electrical signal carrying all the channels is modulated on a light beam and sent through the fiber. The fiber trunkline goes to several distribution hubs, from which multiple fibers fan out to carry the signal to boxes called optical nodes in local communities.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new method {{based on the}} elec-tromagnetic time-reversal (EMTR) theory for locating faults in power networks. The applicability of the EMTR technique to lo-cate faults is first discussed. Using the classical transmission-line equations in the frequency domain, analytical expressions are de-rived to infer {{the location of the}} fault. The accuracy of the pro-posed method is then discussed in relation to the number of obser-vation points adopted to record the fault-originated electromag-netic transients. Then, this paper illustrates the extension of the proposed method to the time domain. The experimental valida-tion of the proposed method is presented by making reference to a reduced-scale <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> system where real faults are hard-ware-emulated. Finally, the application of the proposed EMTR-based fault-location method to Electromagnetic Transients Pro-gram-simulated cases is presented. The simulated test cases are: a mixed overhead/coaxial cable transmission system and the IEEE 34 -bus distribution test feeder. Compared to other transient-based fault-location techniques, the proposed method {{presents a}} number of advantages, namely, its straightforward applicability to inho-mogeneous media (mixed overhead and <b>coaxial</b> power <b>cable</b> <b>lines),</b> the use of a single observation (measurement) point, and robust-ness against fault type and fault impedance.

5000|$|Space cloth is a {{hypothetical}} infinite plane of conductive material having a resistance of η ohms per square, where η is the Impedance of free space. η ≈ 376.7 ohms. If a transmission line composed of straight parallel perfect conductors in free space is terminated by space cloth that is normal to {{the transmission line}} then that transmission line is terminated by its characteristic impedance. [...] The calculation of the characteristic impedance of a transmission line composed of straight, parallel good conductors may {{be replaced by the}} calculation of the D.C. resistance between electrodes placed on a two-dimensional resistive surface. This equivalence can be used in reverse to calculate the resistance between two conductors on a resistive sheet if the arrangement of the conductors {{is the same as the}} cross section of a transmission line of known impedance.

50|$|The {{majority}} of modern transmitting equipment {{is designed to}} operate with a resistive load fed via <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> of a particular characteristic impedance, often 50 ohms. To connect the power stage of the transmitter to this <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> transmission <b>line</b> a matching network is required. For solid state transmitters this is typically a broadband transformer which steps up the low impedance of the output devices to 50 ohms. A tube transmitter will contain a tuned output network, most commonly a PI network, that steps the load impedance which the tube requires down to 50 ohms. In each case the power producing devices will not transfer power efficiently if the network is detuned or badly designed or if the antenna presents other than 50 ohms at the transmitter output. Commonly an SWR meter and/or directional wattmeter are used to check {{the extent of the}} match between the aerial system and the transmitter via the transmission line (feeder). A directional wattmeter indicates forward power, reflected power, and often SWR as well. Each transmitter will specify a maximum allowable mismatch based on efficiency, distortion, and possible damage to the transmitter. Many transmitters have automatic circuits to reduce power or shut down if this value is exceeded.|$|R
