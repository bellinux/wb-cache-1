5|$|Diptera {{go through}} a {{complete}} metamorphosis with four distinct life stages – egg, larva, pupa and adult. In many flies, the larval stage is long and adults may have a short life. Most dipteran larvae develop in protected environments; many are aquatic and others are found in moist places such as carrion, fruit, vegetable matter, fungi and, {{in the case of}} parasitic species, inside their hosts. They tend to have thin cuticles and become desiccated if exposed to the air. Apart from the Brachycera, most dipteran larvae have sclerotinised head <b>capsules,</b> which may be reduced to remnant mouth hooks; the Brachycera, however, have soft, gelatinized head <b>capsules</b> from which the sclerites are reduced or missing.

40|$|Background: Remote {{manipulation}} of wireless <b>capsule</b> endoscopes might improve diagnostic accuracy and facilitate therapy. Objective: To test a new capsule-manipulation system. Setting: University hospital. Design and Interventions: A first-in-human study tested a new magnetic maneuverable wireless <b>capsule</b> in a volunteer. A wireless <b>capsule</b> endoscope was modified to include neodymium-iron-boron magnets. The <b>capsule's</b> magnetic switch {{was replaced with}} a thermal one and turned on by placing it in hot water. One imager {{was removed from the}} Pill Cam colon-based <b>capsule,</b> and the available space was used to house the magnets. A handheld external magnet was used to manipulate this <b>capsule</b> in the esophagus and stomach. The <b>capsule</b> was initiated by placing it in a mug of hot water. The <b>capsule</b> was swallowed and observed in the esophagus and stomach by using a gastroscope. <b>Capsule</b> images were viewed on a real-time viewer. Main Outcome Measurements: The <b>capsule</b> was manipulated in the esophagus for 10 minutes. It was easy to make the <b>capsule</b> turn somersaults and to ungulate at the cardioesophageal junction. In the stomach, it was easy to move the <b>capsule</b> back from the pylorus to the cardioesophageal junction and hold/spin the <b>capsule</b> at any position in the stomach. The <b>capsule</b> in the esophagus and stomach did not cause discomfort. Limitations: Magnetic force varies with the fourth power of distance. Conclusions: This study suggests that remote {{manipulation of}} a <b>capsule</b> in the esophagus and stomach of a human is feasible and might enhance diagnostic endoscopy as well as enable therapeutic wireless <b>capsule</b> endoscopy...|$|R
40|$|<b>Capsule</b> {{endoscope}} aspiration {{into the}} respiratory tract {{is a rare}} complication of <b>capsule</b> endoscopy. Despite the potential seriousness of this complication, no accepted methods exist to accurately predict and therefore prevent it. We describe {{the case of an}} 85 -year-old male who presented for evaluation of iron deficiency anemia. He complained of dysphagia while ingesting a patency <b>capsule,</b> with several attempts over a period of 5 min before he was successful. Five days later, he underwent <b>capsule</b> endoscopy, where he experienced similar symptoms in swallowing the <b>capsule.</b> The rest of the examination proceeded uneventfully. On reviewing the captured images, the <b>capsule</b> endoscope was revealed to be aspirated, remaining in the respiratory tract for approximately 220 s before images of the esophagus and stomach appeared. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of a patient who experienced <b>capsule</b> endoscope aspiration after ingestion of a patency <b>capsule.</b> This case suggests that repeated attempts required for ingesting the patency <b>capsule</b> can predict <b>capsule</b> endoscope aspiration. We presume that paying sufficient attention to the symptoms of a patient who ingests a patency <b>capsule</b> could help us prevent serious complications such as aspiration of the <b>capsule</b> endoscope. In addition, this experience implies the potential risk for ingesting the patency <b>capsule.</b> We must be aware that the patency <b>capsule</b> could also be aspirated and there may be more unrecognized aspiration cases...|$|R

40|$|Background {{and study}} aims: Video <b>capsule</b> {{endoscopy}} (VCE) is invaluable {{in the diagnosis}} of small-bowel pathology. <b>Capsule</b> retention {{is a major concern}} in patients with Crohn's disease. The patency <b>capsule</b> was designed to evaluate small-bowel patency before VCE. However, the actual benefit of the patency <b>capsule</b> test in Crohn's disease remains unclear. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the clinical impact of patency <b>capsule</b> use on the risk of video <b>capsule</b> retention in patients with established Crohn's disease. Patients and methods: This was a retrospective, multicenter study of patients with established Crohn's disease who underwent VCE for clinical need. The utilization strategy for the patency <b>capsule</b> was classified as selective (only in patients with obstructive symptoms, history of intestinal obstruction or surgery, or per treating physician's request) or nonselective (all patients with Crohn's disease). The main outcome was video <b>capsule</b> retention in the entire cohort and within each utilization strategy. Results: A total of 406 patients who were referred for VCE were included in the study. VCE was performed in 132 / 406 patients (32. 5 %) without a prior patency <b>capsule</b> test. The patency <b>capsule</b> test was performed in 274 / 406 patients (67. 5 %) and was negative in 193 patients. Overall, VCE was performed in 343 patients and was retained in the small bowel in 8 (2. 3 %). In this cohort, the risk of video <b>capsule</b> retention in the small bowel was 1. 5 % without use of a prior patency <b>capsule</b> and 2. 1 % after a negative patency test (P = 0. 9). A total of 18 patients underwent VCE after a positive patency <b>capsule</b> test, with a retention rate of 11. 1 % (P = 0. 01). Patency <b>capsule</b> administration strategy (selective vs. nonselective) was not associated with the risk of video <b>capsule</b> retention. Conclusions: <b>Capsule</b> retention is a rare event in patients with established Crohn's disease undergoing VCE. The risk of video <b>capsule</b> retention was not reduced by the nonselective use of the patency <b>capsule.</b> Furthermore, VCE after a positive patency <b>capsule</b> test in patients with Crohn's disease was associated with a high risk of video <b>capsule</b> retention...|$|R

In a manner and style considered similar to Tetris, the player manipulates each capsule as it vertically falls 1 unit of space at a time, able to move it left or right and rotate it 90 degrees in either clockwise or counter-clockwise. When four or more capsule halves or viruses of matching color are aligned in vertical or horizontal configurations, they are removed from play. Any remaining capsule halves or whole <b>capsules</b> which are now not supported by a virus or capsule will fall {{to the bottom of the}} playing field or until it hits another supported object, and any new 4-in-a-row alignments created from this will also be removed.

5|$|Mating in the tawny {{nurse shark}} is known to occur from July to August off Madagascar. Adult females have one {{functional}} ovary and two functional uteruses. The mode of reproduction is aplacental viviparity, meaning that the embryos hatch inside the uterus; females in captivity have been documented depositing up to 52 non-viable egg <b>capsules,</b> {{which has led to}} erroneous reports of this shark being oviparous. The egg <b>capsules</b> of this species are onion-shaped, with thin, brown, translucent shells. The {{tawny nurse shark}} is the only carpet shark in which there is oophagy: once the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, they gorge on eggs produced by the mother and acquire the distended abdomen characteristic of such oophagous embryos. Unlike in mackerel sharks, the eggs consumed by the embryos are large and shelled rather than small and undeveloped. There is no evidence of sibling cannibalism as in the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus).|$|E
