However, the design of <b>cable</b> percussive <b>drill</b> is mainly relied on empirical methods or simplified formulas, the dynamic characteristics of coupling system has not been fully understood. Based on the special conditions, the two degrees of freedom dynamic system coupling with buffering mechanism and bit is analyzed, and the vibration differential equation is built. Finally, the modal frequency of system is obtained by numerical method, and the correlation between the modal frequency of system and the structure parameters is built. The result develops the design theory of <b>cable</b> percussive <b>drill</b> and provides valuable preferences for the optimal design...|$|R

5000|$|Reuben Carlton [...] "Carl" [...] Baker, Sr. (July 18, 1872 - September 29, 1957) was an American oil {{industry}} drilling pioneer. He established {{the forerunner of}} Baker International (ultimately Baker Hughes) in 1907 after developing a casing shoe that revolutionized <b>cable</b> tool <b>drilling.</b> In 1903, he introduced the offset bit for <b>cable</b> tool <b>drilling</b> to enable casing wells in hard rock and in 1912 the cement retainer that allowed casing to be cemented in the wells. Baker further improved the process with the float shoe in 1923. He is credited with obtaining more than 150 new or improved patents on oil drilling tools.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The deep ice-sheet coring (DISC) drill {{consists}} of four major mechanical drilling subsystems and four subsystems supporting on-surface activities. The mechanical drilling subsystems are a drill sonde, a <b>drill</b> <b>cable,</b> a tower and a winch. The drill sonde is the down-hole portion of the drill system and {{consists of}} six distinct sections: (1) the cutter head, (2) the core barrel, (3) the screen section, (4) the motor/pump section, (5) the instrument section and (6) the upper sonde, which includes anti-torques and <b>drill</b> <b>cable</b> terminations. The <b>drill</b> <b>cable</b> not only provides the means of supporting the drill sonde in the borehole, but also provides conduits for electrical power and data transmission. The tower tilts to allow the drill sonde to be serviced in the horizontal position without removing it from the tower. The winch provides a means of quickly raising the sonde from the borehole and providing the fine control necessary for coring operations...|$|R
5000|$|Drilled wells are {{typically}} created using either top-head rotary style, table rotary, or <b>cable</b> tool <b>drilling</b> machines, {{all of which}} use drilling stems that are turned to create a cutting action in the formation, hence the term drilling.|$|R
5000|$|The oldest form of {{drilling}} machinery is the cable tool, still used today. Specifically designed {{to raise and}} lower a bit into the bore hole, the spudding of the drill causes the bit to be raised and dropped onto {{the bottom of the}} hole, and the design of the cable causes the bit to twist at approximately [...] revolution per drop, thereby creating a drilling action. Unlike rotary <b>drilling,</b> <b>cable</b> tool <b>drilling</b> requires the drilling action to be stopped so that the bore hole can be bailed or emptied of drilled cuttings.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cable</b> tool <b>drilling</b> was {{developed}} in ancient China and was used for drilling brine wells. The salt domes also held natural gas, which some wells produced and which was used for evaporation of the brine. Chinese well drilling technology was introduced to Europe in 1828.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{there were}} many efforts in the mid-19th century to drill for oil Edwin Drake's 1859 well near Titusville, Pennsylvania, is {{considered}} the first [...] "modern oil well". Drake's well touched off a major boom in oil production in the United States. [...] Drake learned of <b>cable</b> tool <b>drilling</b> from Chinese laborers in the U. S. [...] The first primary product was kerosene for lamps and heaters. Similar developments around Baku fed the European market.|$|R
50|$|Cable tool rigs are {{simpler and}} cheaper than {{similarly}} sized rotary rigs, although loud and very slow to operate. The world record cable tool well was drilled in New York {{to a depth}} of almost 12,000 ft. The common Bucyrus-Erie 22 can drill down to about 1,100 ft. Since <b>cable</b> tool <b>drilling</b> does not use air to eject the drilling chips like a rotary, instead using a cable strung bailer, technically there is no limitation on depth.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mechanical}} {{success of}} <b>cable</b> tool <b>drilling</b> has greatly depended on a device called jars, invented by a spring pole driller, William Morris, {{in the salt}} well days of the 1830s. Little is known about Morris except for his invention and that he listed Kanawha County (now in West Virginia) as his address. Morris received [...] for this unique tool in 1841 for artesian well drilling. Later, using jars, the cable tool system was able to efficiently {{meet the demands of}} drilling wells for oil.|$|R
5000|$|The {{well was}} financed by Charles B. Shaffer of Chicago, who hired Slick to drill wells at the Frank Wheeler farm using <b>cable</b> tool <b>drilling</b> techniques, {{which could not}} prevent gushers or blowouts. Three {{unsuccessful}} wells preceded the strike, which initially produced 400 barrels of high-grade oil a day from a depth of between 2319 ft and 2347 ft. Because no mechanism existed to control the flow, the oil was diverted into pits for collection and storage. The source of the oil was a sand zone in the Drumright Dome, a syncline. Slick attempted to keep the strike secret, hiring armed guards, [...] but eventually revealed the well's success in April 1912. A dugout built for the guards remains on the site, together with a commemorative plaque.|$|R
50|$|Wherever possible, the cut-and-cover {{construction}} {{method was}} desirable. Some sections between Central and the university, underneath the Hirschengraben, and from Bellevue to Heimplatz, {{were to be}} constructed by drilling and blasting. A direct routing between the main station and Paradeplatz below the middle part of the Bahnhofstrasse was to be avoided due to water mains and <b>cable</b> tunnels. Instead, <b>drilling</b> a slightly curvy alignment along Rennweg and {{the western side of}} St. Peterhofstatt was suggested.|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} an {{improved}} understanding {{of the effects of}} temperature on the hydro-mechanical behaviour of compacted clays is important in many applications, such as disposal of high level nuclear wastes, burial of high voltage <b>cables,</b> <b>drilling</b> of deep offshore wells, and clay liners used on landfills. In this thesis, a study of the thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) behaviour of kaolin clay under different conditions is presented. A series of experimental unsaturated tests was carried out, including temperature and suction controlled oedometer tests, and suction measurements to obtain the soil water retention curves at different temperatures. In order to describe the dependency of the soil water retention curves on temperature, the influences of temperature on the contact angle of menisci and the microstructure of the soil samples were studied. Moreover, Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy was employed for studying the microstructure of the soil at certain conditions of interest. A new suction and temperature controlled oedometer cell was designed, developed and calibrated for investigating THM behaviour of kaolin clay. The oedometer was used to examine the combined effects of suction and temperature on compressibility and collapse behaviour of the soil. In this thesis, special attention was given to the filter paper methodology for suction measurements at different temperatures. The calibration curve of Whatman No. 42 filter paper was determined at 10, 25 and 50 ºC using the vapour equilibrium technique with sodium chloride solutions at different concentrations and the axis translation technique. Based on the experimental data, a unique calibration equation was proposed; taking into account the effect of temperature. The experimental results showed that temperature has a relevant influence on filter paper suction measurement and that misleading results can be obtained if temperature is not taken into account in the calibration equation...|$|R

50|$|Baker International {{was formed}} by Reuben C. Baker, who {{developed}} a Casing shoe, that revolutionized <b>cable</b> tool <b>drilling.</b> In July 1907, R.C. Baker, a 34-year-old inventor and entrepreneur in Coalinga, California, was granted a U.S. patent for a casing shoe that enabled drillers to efficiently run casing and cement it in oil wells. This innovation launched the business that would become Baker Oil Tools and Baker Hughes Incorporated. Mr. Baker {{had arrived in the}} California oilfield in 1895 with 95 cents in his pocket and dreams of making his fortune in the Los Angeles oil boom. Subsequently, he hauled oil for drillers with a team of horses and became a drilling contractor and an oil wildcatter before achieving success as an innovator in oilfield equipment. In 1928, Baker Casing Shoe Company changed its name to Baker Oil Tools, Inc., to reflect its product line of completion, cementing and fishing equipment.|$|R

In this paper, a hybrid algorithm is used to optimize indoor wireless network planning while satisfying three demands: maximum coverage, minimal full installation cost (<b>cabling,</b> <b>cable</b> gutters, <b>drilling</b> holes, labor, etc.), and minimal human exposure.

50|$|Drilled wells {{are usually}} cased with a factory-made pipe, {{typically}} steel (in air rotary or <b>cable</b> tool <b>drilling)</b> or plastic/PVC (in mud rotary wells, {{also present in}} wells drilled into solid rock). The casing is constructed by welding, either chemically or thermally, segments of casing together. If the casing is installed during the drilling, most drills will drive the casing into the ground as the bore hole advances, while some newer machines will actually allow for the casing to be rotated and drilled into the formation {{in a similar manner}} as the bit advancing just below. PVC or plastic is typically welded and then lowered into the drilled well, vertically stacked with their ends nested and either glued or splined together. The sections of casing are usually 6 m or more in length, and 6 to 12 in in diameter, depending on the intended use of the well and local groundwater conditions.|$|R
40|$|Multi-factor {{productivity}} (MFP) in underground {{coal mining}} {{has been on}} the decline for the last decade. The mining industry requires a viable and sustainable approach to overcome the current downtrend. This is only possible by concurrently focussing on productivity improvement and operating costs reduction, delivered through both incremental and step change technology development. Four technologies are presented in this paper: fibre optic borehole sensing has been demonstrated to reveal detailed information about gas flow influx, water level and borehole blockage events occurring along the length of a surface-to-inseam lateral. Fibre optic gas sensing has also been investigated, and this technology promises a remote, intrinsically safe, distributed solution. Recent developments in continuous water jet drilling technology have demonstrated a step change increase in drilling rates and flexibility for coal seam degassing, applicable in both surface-to-inseam and underground in-seam applications.

Since then, another 624 land wells have been drilled around Miri until 1972 which are collectively known as the [...] "Miri field". The Miri field is the only onshore field in Sarawak, because oil production has shifted offshore since the late 1950s. The first oil well on Canada Hill (Miri Well No. 1) produced a total of 0.65 million oil barrels for the next 60 years until its closure on 31 October 1972.

40|$|A common {{fear for}} all ice drillers is a stuck drill. A less severe but {{important}} concern is a foreign object in a borehole, deflected borehole or slush formation in a borehole {{filled with an}} ethanol-water solution (EWS). Prevention is {{the most efficient way}} to avoid troublesome situations. However, should these problems arise it is important to be equipped with safe and efficient tools. A stuck drill occurs rather frequently but it is rarely serious. Electro-mechanical (EM) drills usually become stuck due to inefficient chip removal from the kerf. When the drill gets stuck there are several possible actions. The simplest initial approach should be sharp jerks with a reverse rotating core barrel. Many times the Byrd Polar Research Center (BPRC) dry hole EM drill has been successfully recover using this technique. When this technique fails, another solution to the problem is to pour a few liters of auto-antifreeze into the hole using a rubber hose to bypass the upper firn. This usually frees the drill in less than one hour. In 1999 the cable on the BPRC EM drill broke, but we successfully recovered the drill from 110 m depth using 2 ̆ 7 fishing tool 2 ̆ 7. Ethanol thermal drills also experience complications. In order to free a thermal drill when the main heating element has failed, a second heating element can be turned-on by switching the polarity of the power. There are a number of reasons why slush can form and clog a borehole. This paper presents a field proven technique for the EWS concentration correction at any depth in the borehole. Directional drilling (DD) techniques can be used to resume drilling if the drill or foreign object cannot be removed from the borehole.
