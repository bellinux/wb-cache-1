We show that incorporation of {{two different types of}} delay, length independent and length dependent, leads to dramatically different temporal properties of the network. In the first case formation of global random <b>connections</b> <b>leads</b> to increased temporal ordering, while in the second case it annihilates locally ordered clusters and forms a disordered state.

During their second therapy session, Amy experiences a miscarriage, but the couple returns to therapy to work on their issues. Amy's inability to hold emotional <b>connection</b> <b>leads</b> her to have an affair with her boss, a man she finds [...] "gross" [...] but uses as a buffer against her husband. Jake and Amy each have an individual session, the first in which Jake breaks down his family of intellectuals, and the second in which Amy recounts watching her father die while he was sitting next to her and was hit by a car after they got ice cream. She and Jake finally and sadly decide to end their tumultuous marriage and split custody of their son. Jake thinks the therapy was helpful, but Amy thinks it hurt their marriage.|$|E

50|$|When a Kelvin {{connection}} is used, current is supplied via {{a pair of}} source <b>connections</b> (current <b>leads).</b> These generate a voltage drop across the impedance to be measured according to Ohm's law V=IR. A pair of sense <b>connections</b> (voltage <b>leads)</b> are made immediately adjacent to the target impedance, {{so that they do}} not include the voltage drop in the force leads or contacts. Since almost no current flows to the measuring instrument, the voltage drop in the sense leads is negligible.|$|R
