40|$|Aims: To {{demonstrate}} {{the effects of}} intravesical ozone treatment on inflammation and epithelial cell damage in <b>chemical</b> <b>cystitis</b> animal model. Materials and Methods: A total of 30 New Zealand rabbits were divided into six groups. Cystitis was conducted with transurethral intravesical hydrochloric acid instillation on the subjects in Groups IA, IB, IIA, and IIB. Then, Group IA-IB subjects were transurethrally administered intravesical ozone therapy twice a week, while Group IIA-IIB subjects were only given intravesical isotonic NaCl instillation. Group IIIA-IIIB subjects were administered intravesical isotonic NaCl instillation without conducting <b>chemical</b> <b>cystitis</b> {{in order to create}} the same stress. Treatment schemes of all groups were arranged in the same manner. Following a 3 -week (early period) and 6 -week (late period) therapy, the rabbits were sacrificed and histopathologic investigations were carried out in order to demonstrate changes in the urinary bladder. Results: In our study, we observed that the basal membrane and mucosal integrity were maintained, inflammatory cells were suppressed in Group IA-IB (Early and late period), which received ozone therapy. However, it was also observed that mucosal integrity was spoiled, numerous inflammatory cells were accumulated in Group IIA-IIB, which was administered isotonic NaCl. Conclusion: Due to its low cost and minimal side effects; ozone therapy could be a new therapeutic approach in the treatment of interstitial cystitis...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} effects of {{intravesical}} agents, doxorubicin, mitomycin C (MMC), and epirubicin on release of mediators and inflammatory cytokines from the urothelium, and tissue responses and morphological integrity of the bladder. Intravesical therapy which administers cytotoxic agents into the bladder lumen is an important approach for treatment of superficial bladder cancer. Despite evidence of significant local adverse effects such as <b>chemical</b> <b>cystitis</b> (dysuria, increased urinary frequency and urgency) following this treatment, few studies have assessed their effects on non-malignant tissues of the bladder and the changes in urinary function resulting from this therapy. A {{better understanding of the}} mechanisms of bladder toxicity by these agents may lead to the identification of novel approaches forreducing the severity of reported adverse effects. Moreover, {{the effects of}} ageing on bladder function were also investigated in this thesis...|$|E
50|$|Adenovirus (particularly serotypes 11 and 21 of {{subgroup}} B) is {{the most}} common cause of acute viral hemorrhagic cystitis in children, though it can result from BK virus as well. A <b>chemical</b> hemorrhagic <b>cystitis</b> can develop when vaginal products are inadvertently placed in the urethra. Gentian violet douching to treat candidiasis has resulted in hemorrhagic cystitis when the drug was misplaced in the urethra, but this hemorrhagic cystitis resolved spontaneously with cessation of treatment. Accidental urethral placement of contraceptive suppositories has also caused hemorrhagic cystitis in several patients. The bladder irritation was thought to be caused by the spermicidal detergent nonoxynol-9. In the acute setting, the bladder can be copiously irrigated with alkalinized normal saline to minimize bladder irritation.|$|R
40|$|The role {{of sodium}} {{hyaluronate}} and sodium chondroitin sulphate {{in the management}} of bladder disease Rocco Damiano and Antonio Cicione Abstract: Bladder epithelium is not only a simple defence against infections, {{but it is also a}} specialized tissue regulating complex bladder functions and playing an active role in the pathogenesis of many bladder diseases. There is strong evidence that different chronic inflammatory bladder diseases, such as recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), <b>chemical</b> or radiation <b>cystitis</b> and painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC), can be pathophy-siologically linked in the first step of the disease to the loss of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) mucous layer independently of the original cause of the inflammatory process. The aim of this article is to review the current evidence on the clinic applications of GAGs in urology, with particular emphasis on the therapeutic use of hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulphate (CS).

40|$|We {{have studied}} the effects of two newly {{developed}} tachykinin antagonists, MEN 1 0, 207 and MEN 1 0, 376, which are highly selective for NK- 2 tachykinin receptors on tachykinin-induced contraction in the rat urinary bladder and guinea pig airways in vivo. MEN 1 0, 207 exhibited antagonism only at doses which produced agonist effects. By contrast, MEN 1 0, 376 was devoid of significant agonist activity at i. v. doses (1 - 3 moI/kg) which selectively antagonized the effects of an NK- 2 agonist [fl-Ala 8]-neurokinin A(4 - 1 0) (bladder contraction in rats, bronchoconstnc-tion in guinea pigs) without affecting the response to an NK- 1 agonist [Sar]-substance P sulfone (hypotension, salivation and bladder contraction in rats, bronchoconstnction in guinea pigs). At these NK- 2 -selective blocking doses, MEN 10, 376 : 1) did not affect urodynamic parameters at cystometry in normal rats but reduced amplitude of mictuntion contractions following induction of <b>chemical</b> (intravesical xylene) <b>cystitis</b> and 2) reduced by a maximum of 50 % the nonchollnergic bronchoconstrictor re-sponse to vagal nerve stimulation. These findings provide the first evidence for involvement of NK- 2 receptors in physiological responses in the urinary and respiratory tracts. TKs, particularly SP and NKA, are present in primary afferent nerves distributed to several viscera such as the rat urinary bladder and guinea pig airways (Lundberg and Saria...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{pelvic pain}} (CPP) {{is defined as}} pain in the pelvic organs and related {{structures}} of at least 6 months’ duration. The pathophysiology of CPP is uncertain, and its treatment presents challenges. Botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A), known for its antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, and muscle relaxant activity, has been used recently to treat refractory CPP with promising results. In patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, most studies suggest intravesical BoNT-A injection reduces bladder pain and increases bladder capacity. Repeated BoNT-A injection is also effective and reduces inflammation in the bladder. Intraprostatic BoNT-A injection could significantly improve prostate pain and urinary frequency in the patients with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome. Animal studies also suggest BoNT-A injection in the prostate decreases inflammation in the prostate. Patients with CPP due to pelvic muscle pain and spasm also benefit from localized BoNT-A injections. BoNT-A injection in the pelvic floor muscle improves dyspareunia and decreases pelvic floor pressure. Preliminary studies show intravesical BoNT-A injection is useful in inflammatory bladder diseases such as <b>chemical</b> <b>cystitis,</b> radiation cystitis, and ketamine related cystitis. Dysuria {{is the most common}} adverse effect after BoNT-A injection. Very few patients develop acute urinary retention after treatment...|$|E

Recurrence-free rate was significantly higher in the Instillation group than in the TURBT-only group (p= 0. 02, HR = 0. 457). The 5 -year recurrence-free rate was 58. 5 % for the Instillation group and 38. 6 % for the TURBT-only group. Our instillation schedule represents the most intensive regimen among previously reported therapies and resulted in a 54. 3 % decrease in incidence of tumor recurrence.

40|$|In this study, female rats induced with <b>chemical</b> <b>cystitis</b> were {{administered}} the hormone human choriogonadotropin (HCG), {{and it was}} aimed to reveal the usefulness of HCG {{in the treatment of}} interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. The materials for this study were 32 Wistar albino female rats. The study groups were formed as follows: the cystitis group (Group 1), the cystitis + HCG protection group (Group 2), the cystitis + HCG treatment group (Group 3), and the control group (Group 4), with eight rats in each group. In this study, blood and urine samples were taken from the rats, they were euthanized, and their bladders were removed for glutathione, malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interferon gamma measurements. It was observed that tissue damage in Group 2 was lower than that in the other two groups. Glutathione levels in Groups 2 and 4 were significantly higher than in Groups 1 and 3 (p =  0. 01). Malondialdehyde levels of Groups 2 and 4 were significantly lower than the values in Groups 1 and 3 (p <  0. 001). When the cystitis groups were compared in terms of their interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels, the lowest interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels were detected in Group 3. It was found that HCG has positive effects on experimental cystitis in rats. This study revealed that HCG should be researched as a therapeutic agent and formed a step for studies to be carried out on this subject...|$|E

There is strong evidence that different chronic inflammatory bladder diseases, such as recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), <b>chemical</b> or radiation <b>cystitis</b> and painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC), can be pathophysiologically linked in the first step of the disease to the loss of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) mucous layer independently of the original cause of the inflammatory process. The aim of this article is to review the current evidence on the clinic applications of GAGs in urology, with particular emphasis on the therapeutic use of hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulphate (CS). A comprehensive electronic literature search was conducted in May 2011 using the Medline database. Three studies supported the decrease of the rate of recurrent UTIs by restoring the GAG layer, showing a significant reduction of UTI rates and a prolonged median time to recurrence after HA intravesical instillations in women with recurrent UTI. We provide higher level evidence by reporting a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on the use of intravesical HA and CS in women with recurrent UTIs. A significant reduction of 77 % in the UTI rate per patient per year versus placebo was observed at the end of the study. Nine studies were published between 2002 and 2011 on the use of HA and CS to treat PBS/IC. Three of them evaluated the use of GAGs bladder instillation to prolong the effects of bladder hydrodistension. In the other six studies the efficacy of HA bladder instillations to reduce symptoms score was assessed. Preliminary studies support data on the role of HA–CS in detrusor overactivity, nonbacterial cystitis and urological malignancies. Few data are available regarding the mode of action of HA–CS or its effectiveness in the management of bladder diseases. The major issue in interpreting the available evidence regarding HA–CS is that most of the reported studies are nonrandomized and without a control arm. HA–CS may be considered for further studies, including randomized, controlled trials with adequate power...|$|R
40|$|A multicenter {{study was}} {{performed}} in 110 patients with superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Adriamycin (50 mg/ 50 ml) was administered intravesically within 24 h after transurethral resection of TA-T 1 (O-A) bladder tumors. Instillation was repeated twice during the first week, then weekly during the first month, and monthly for 1 year. Tolerance was evaluated in these 110 patients and 29 patients presented with local side effects. In 24 of these patients the <b>chemical</b> <b>cystitis</b> was severe enough to cause them {{to drop out of}} the study. No systemic side effect was observed. Recurrence was studied in 82 evaluable patients at 1 year of follow-up and on 72 patients followed for 2 - 3 years (mean: 32 months). Of these 82 patients, 23 were primary cases and 59 recurrent. In all 82 patients, 50 (61 %) did not show any recurrence after 1 year, while 32 (39 %) presented with one or more recurrences. Of these recurrences, 27 were T 1 tumors while 5 progressed to more invasive lesions. In patients that were free of recurrence during the first year, 80 % remained tumor-free during the 2 - 3 year follow-up period. In patients who had developed one or more recurrences during the first year, only half of them developed further recurrences once the instillations were stopped. The beneficial effect of adriamycin appears obvious and might be related to the drug itself, the early and repeated instillations after TUR, or both factors. © 1983 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|PURPOSE: This paper aims to {{evaluate}} the safety and heating efficiency of external deep pelvic hyperthermia combined with intravesical mitomycin C (MMC) as a novel therapy for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled subjects with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) refractory NMIBC to an early phase clinical trial of external deep pelvic hyperthermia (using a BSD- 2000 device) combined with MMC. Bladders were heated to 42 [*]°C for 1 [*]h during intravesical MMC treatment. Treatments were given weekly for 6 weeks, then monthly for 4 months. Heating parameters, treatment toxicity, and clinical outcomes were systematically measured. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were enrolled on the clinical trial. Median age was 66 years and 87 % were male. Median European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) recurrence and progression scores were 6 and 8, respectively. The full treatment course was attained in 73 % of subjects. Effective bladder heating was possible {{in all but one}} patient who could not tolerate the supine position due to lung disease. Adverse events were all minor (grade 2 or less) and no systemic toxicity was observed. The most common adverse effects were Foley catheter pain (40 %), abdominal discomfort (33 %), <b>chemical</b> <b>cystitis</b> symptoms (27 %), and abdominal skin swelling (27 %). With a median follow-up of 3. 18 years, 67 % experienced another bladder cancer recurrence (none were muscle invasive) and 13 % experienced an upper tract recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: External deep pelvic hyperthermia using the BSD- 2000 device is a safe and reproducible method of heating the bladder in patients undergoing intravesical MMC. The efficacy of this treatment modality should be explored further in clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{standard}} method for pancreatic transplantation involves drainage of exocrine secretions into the urinary bladder with venous outflow into the systemic circulation. Despite the high success rate {{associated with this}} approach, it often leads to complications, including <b>chemical</b> <b>cystitis,</b> reflux pancreatitis, metabolic acidosis, and hyperinsulinemia. The authors developed a new technique of pancreatic transplantation with portal drainage of endocrine secretions and enteric drainage of exocrine secretions (PE), which theoretically should be more physiologic. PROCEDURES: All patients were insulin-dependent diabetics with end-stage renal disease who underwent combined kidney-pancreas transplantation. Between 1990 and 1994, 19 patients have been transplanted using intraperitoneal placement of the pancreas allograft with exocrine drainage into a Roux-en Y loop and venous drainage into the portal circulations (PE). A comparison group of all patients undergoing standard systemic-bladder (SB) transplantation between April 1989 and March 1993 (n = 28) also was studied. Patient follow-up ranges from 6 months to 5 years for the SB patients (mean = 2. 5 years) and 6 months to 4 years for the PE patients (mean = 1. 6 years). Routine follow-up includes documentation of the clinical course and detailed endocrine studies. FINDINGS: Patient and graft actuarial survival at 1 and 3 years is no different for SB and PE patients. Urinary tract infections occurred in 89. 3 % of the SB patients (2. 8 /patient) versus 26. 3 % of the PE patients (0. 25 /patient, p < or = 0. 0001). None of the PE patients experienced hematuria compared with 53. 6 % of the SB patients (p < or = 0. 0001); however, two PE patients had melanotic episodes. The incidence of urinary retention and reflux pancreatitis was 32. 1 % versus 5. 3 % (p < or = 0. 028) for SB and PE groups, respectively. Patients in the SB group required sodium bicarbonate therapy (mean = 55 mEq/day) although no PE patient required routine therapy; despite this, SB patients experienced more episodes of acidosis (44 vs. 5). Endocrine studies indicate no difference in glycosylated hemoglobin or fasting and stimulated glucose values throughout the follow-up period. In contrast, hyperinsulinemia was evident in both fasting and stimulated tests for the SB patients, with values consistently two- to fivefold {{higher than those of}} the PE group. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that PE and SB pancreas transplantation are equivalent in terms of patient and graft survival and suggest that the PE approach is associated with a decreased incidence of metabolic and bladder-related complications. In addition, the PE approach eliminates the state of peripheral hyperinsulinemia that characterizes the SB procedure. Continued follow-up will be necessary to determine if long-term outcomes will differ for patients with PE and SB grafts...|$|E
