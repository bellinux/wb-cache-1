25|$|The {{earliest}} public {{warnings about}} the reckless and fradulent CIS in West Bengal started in 2009 from MPs Somendra Nath Mitra and Abu Hasem Khan Choudhury and TMC leader Sadhan Pande. Apart from the SEBI investigation, no executive actions were taken at this time. On 7 December 2012, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Duvvuri Subbarao said the West Bengal government should initiate suo motu action against {{companies that were}} indulging in financial malpractice. By that time, the Saradha Group Ponzi scheme was already beginning to unravel. In January 2013, the group's <b>cash</b> <b>inflow</b> was, for the first time, less than its cash payouts. This outcome is inevitable in a Ponzi scheme that is allowed to run full course. Sudipto Sen tried but failed to calm uneasy depositors and agents, and could not increase inflow of funds.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} optimal portfolios with discounted stochastic <b>cash</b> <b>inflows</b> (SCI). The <b>cash</b> <b>inflows</b> are invested into {{a market}} that is characterized by inflation-linked bond, a stock and a cash account. It was assumed that inflation- linked bond, stock and the <b>cash</b> <b>inflows</b> are stochastic and follow a standard geometric Brownian motion. The vari ational form of Merton portfolio strategy was obtained by assuming that the investor chooses constant relative risk averse (CRRA) utility function. The inter-temporal hedging terms that offset any shock to the SCI were obtained. A closed form solution to our resulting non-linear partial differential equation was obtained. </p...|$|R

30|$|The {{direction}} of the changes of the total additional payment surplus is as expected from an analytical point of view: an increase (decrease) of the cash outflows leads to a decrease (increase) of the total additional payment surplus and vice versa for the <b>cash</b> <b>inflows.</b> Here, increased (decreased) savings or increased (decreased) <b>cash</b> <b>inflows</b> lead to an increased (decreased) total additional payment surplus.|$|R
500|$|Lincoln {{stayed in}} business; from mid-1987 to April 1989, its assets grew from $3.91 billion to $5.46 billion. During this time, the parent American Continental Corporation was desperate for <b>cash</b> <b>inflow</b> {{to make up}} for losses in real estate {{purchases}} and projects. Lincoln's branch managers and tellers, by order of John Granger, convinced customers to replace their federally-insured certificates of deposit with higher-yielding bond certificates of American Continental; the customers later said they were never properly informed that the bonds were uninsured and very risky given the state of American Continental's finances. Indeed, the regulators had already adjudged the bonds to have no solvent backing. FDIC chair L. William Seidman would later write that Lincoln's push to get depositors to switch was [...] "one of the most heartless and cruel frauds in modern memory." ...|$|E
500|$|As Lincoln grew, {{money was}} {{siphoned}} from Lincoln {{to the parent}} American Continental Corporation {{under a variety of}} schemes, and American Continental spent lavishly on speculative investments and personal expenses. A new regulatory investigation began in July 1988. After Arthur Young indicated doubts about some accounting practices, Keating fired them in September 1988 and switched to Touche Ross.

2500|$|Rabbi Aharon Rokeach, {{known as}} the [...] "Wonder Rebbe", {{was at the top}} of the Gestapo's [...] "wanted list" [...] of rabbis {{targeted}} for extradition and extermination during the Nazi occupation of Poland. With <b>cash</b> <b>inflow</b> from Belzer Hasidim in Palestine, England, and the United States, the Rebbe and his half-brother, Rabbi Mordechai of Bilgoray, 22 years his junior, managed to stay one step ahead of the Nazis in one escape attempt after another. Notwithstanding the watchful presence of Gestapo patrols at every turn, the pair was spirited out of Premishlan into the Kraków Ghetto, and then to the Bochnia ghetto. In their most hair-raising escape attempt, the brothers were driven out of occupied Poland and into Hungary by Major General István Újszászy, head of the Vkf2 Hungarian counter-intelligence who was friendly to Jews and acting on orders of Hungarian Regent Admiral Miklós Horthy. The Rebbe, his brother, and his attendant, shorn of their distinctive beards and payot (sidelocks), were disguised as Russian generals who had been captured at the front and were being taken to Budapest for questioning.|$|E
30|$|Hence, when {{estimating}} the <b>cash</b> <b>inflows,</b> special attention {{has to be}} paid to the consequences of misestimating long-termed effects like customer-related issues, as these can be higher than rather short-termed ones. Moreover, as the <b>cash</b> <b>inflows</b> depend on the aggregated function over all corporate activities, these can be higher than the other components that only focus on single corporate activities and consequently have a considerable stronger effect on the model results.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a computational technique {{for the evaluation}} of the distribution of the net present value (NPV) of an investment, in which the <b>cash</b> <b>inflows</b> occur at random time points, {{as in the case of}} venture capital. The initial cash outlay is deterministic and the magnitudes of the <b>cash</b> <b>inflows</b> are nonnegative, random variables with known distributions. The lengths of the intervals between successive <b>cash</b> <b>inflows</b> are independently distributed and independent of the magnitude of the inflows. The Laplace transforms and the first two moments of the distribution are computed for both independent and perfectly correlated inflows. It is shown that the use of constant time intervals when the timing of the inflows is random underestimates the variance of the distribution of the NPV. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a computational technique {{for the evaluation}} of the net present value (NPV) of an investment, in which the <b>cash</b> <b>inflows</b> occur at random time points and which terminates after a fixed time interval. The initial cash outlay is deterministic and the magnitudes of the <b>cash</b> <b>inflows</b> are nonnegative random variables with known distributions. The lengths of the intervals between successive <b>cash</b> <b>inflows</b> are independently distributed and independent of the magnitude of the inflows. The Laplace transform of the distribution of the NPV is computed for both cases of mutual independence and perfect correlation of the inflows. It is argued that these distributions are indispensable in determining the accuracy of the manager's estimates and in evaluating actual versus expected performance of a project. ...|$|R
50|$|For example, if a company’s post-tax outlays {{consist of}} CPLTD of $90M and $10M in unfinanced CAPEX, and its noncash {{expenses}} are $100M,then {{the company can}} apply $100M of <b>cash</b> <b>inflow</b> from operations to post-tax outlays without paying taxes on that $100M <b>cash</b> <b>inflow.</b> In this case, the pretax cash that the borrower must set aside for post-tax outlays would simply be $100M.|$|E

30|$|Cash flows {{emerging}} from financial planning {{are based on}} negotiated interest rates. Therefore, <b>cash</b> <b>inflows</b> are directly relatable to corresponding cash outflows, {{in contrast to the}} aforementioned supply chain planning. In particular, there are <b>cash</b> <b>inflows</b> resulting from money borrowing at the capital market. According to solvency, a specific amount can be borrowed and leads to one cash outflow including the full redemption plus interests at maturity (final date redemption). Limited financing objects are considered in the following.|$|R
