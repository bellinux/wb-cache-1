5|$|In 1811, iodine was {{discovered}} by French chemist Bernard <b>Courtois,</b> who was born to a manufacturer of saltpeter (an essential component of gunpowder). At {{the time of the}} Napoleonic Wars, saltpeter was in great demand in France. Saltpeter produced from French nitre beds required sodium carbonate, which could be isolated from seaweed collected on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany. To isolate the sodium carbonate, seaweed was burned and the ash washed with water. The remaining waste was destroyed by adding sulfuric acid. <b>Courtois</b> once added excessive sulfuric acid and a cloud of purple vapour rose. He noted that the vapour crystallised on cold surfaces, making dark crystals. <b>Courtois</b> suspected that this material was a new element but lacked funding to pursue it further.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, Bernard <b>Courtois</b> {{discovered}} iodine {{was present}} in seaweed, and iodine intake was linked with goiter size in 1820 by Jean-Francois Coindet. Gaspard Adolphe Chatin proposed in 1852 that endemic goiter {{was the result of}} not enough iodine intake, and Eugen Baumann demonstrated iodine in thyroid tissue in 1896.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, {{when the}} Parisian saltpetre {{manufacturer}} Bernard <b>Courtois</b> made iodine {{for the first}} time from the kelp ash, his discovery was greeted with great interest by experts. Accum was among the first chemists in England to undertake experiments to isolate iodine. In two articles published in Tilloch's Philosophical Journal in January and February 1814, Accum described the iodine content of different kinds of seaweed and gave a detailed account of a process for iodine production.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Two main {{approximation}} {{methods for}} steady-state analysis of Markov chains are introduced: <b>Courtois’s</b> decomposition method and Takahashi’s iterative method. The <b>Courtois's</b> approach {{is based on}} decomposability properties of the models under consideration. While <b>Courtois's</b> method is non-iterative and is applied for the approximate computation of the steady-state probability vector for a given ergodic Discrete-Time Markov Chain-DTMC (or Continuous-Time Markov Chain), Takahashi's iterative method allows computation of the exact state probability vector. Examples and numerical results are shown...|$|R

5|$|Matić {{took part}} in Chelsea's trophy {{ceremony}} in full kit despite being suspended, similar to what Terry had done after Chelsea won the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final with him suspended. Mourinho did not concur with the official man of the match award going to Terry, stating that the honour {{should have gone to}} Thibaut <b>Courtois</b> and Filipe Luís for their performances against Liverpool, and Andreas Christensen for his performance against Shrewsbury Town.|$|E
5|$|The only goal of {{the match}} came near the midway point of the first half; Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain {{collected}} a pass from Theo Walcott from the right and scored past Thibaut <b>Courtois.</b> Both managers did not shake hands after the game, which drew media attention. Arsenal's victory was their first against Chelsea in over three years and manager Arsène Wenger's first over José Mourinho in 14 attempts.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matić was {{suspended}} for the final, due to a two-match ban he received for pushing over Burnley's Ashley Barnes in a league match on 21 February 2015. Another central midfielder for the club, John Obi Mikel, missed the match through a knee injury. Due to Matić's absence, Kurt Zouma – usually a central defender – moved into defensive midfield, with Gary Cahill introduced into Zouma's previous position. Chelsea made four other changes from their draw with Burnley: Petr Čech started in goal in place of Thibaut <b>Courtois,</b> César Azpilicueta at left-back instead of Filipe Luís, and Ramires and Willian came into the midfield {{at the expense of}} Juan Cuadrado and Oscar. Chelsea set up with a three-man attack, with Eden Hazard and Willian wide of Diego Costa.|$|E
5000|$|Of <b>Courtois's</b> works, {{one book}} of madrigals for five voices {{and a handful}} of works printed in other anthologies survive. Two of the {{separate}} works are motets, written in the early 1540s, and attributed to [...] "Lamberto", who was most likely the composer. The book of madrigals is dedicated to three aristocrats of Ragusa, who were likely students of the composer during his time in that city.|$|R
50|$|Emma Cheves Wilkins {{was born}} on December 10, 1870, the first child of Emma Cheves and Gilbert A. Wilkins. She was a lifelong {{resident}} of Savannah, Georgia and inherited the artistic talents {{of her mother and}} grandmother. Alongside her mother in the 1890s, Wilkins taught art lessons at a studio in Savannah as the market for her artwork extended. As a self-sustaining artist, Wilkins painted portraits of judges, politicians, bankers, doctors, {{and to a lesser extent}} of women and children. Wilkins traveled to Paris in 1896 with fellow Savannah artist Lucile Desbouillons. The pair lived at the American Girl's Club for a few months and were enrolled in Gustave-Claude-Etienne <b>Courtois's</b> class for foreigners. In the 1900s, she began restorative artwork on several paintings.|$|R
40|$|Realistic {{models of}} {{computer}} and communication systems result in large, complex performance models. Compositionality, offered by stochastic process algebra constructs a model from submodels which are {{smaller and more}} tractable. We present a technique to exploit this structure {{in order to enhance}} the solution of the model by decomposition of the underlying Markov process. The decomposition under consideration is time scale decomposition, based on <b>Courtois's</b> near complete decomposability. This work has been influenced by related work on stochastic Petri nets and presents a major advancement related to a preliminary version of this technique already presented at a workshop of this series. In particular, a transformation technique is developed which is based on a delayed choice operator and preserves equivalence. 1 Introduction Stochastic process algebras (SPA) are formal description techniques by which systems are modelled as an interaction of autonomous agents or components who engage i [...] ...|$|R
5|$|French chemist Bernard <b>Courtois</b> {{discovered}} Iodine in 1811, and in 1896 Eugen Baumann documented it as {{the central}} ingredient in the thryoid gland. He did this by boiling the thyroid glands of a thousand sheep, and named the precipitate, {{a combination of the}} thyroid hormones, 'iodothyrin'. David Marine in 1907 provided iodine is necessary for thyroid function. Thyroxine itself was first isolated in 1914 and synthesized in 1927, and trirodothyroxine in 1952. The conversion of T4 to T3 was discovered in 1970. The process of discovering TSH took place over the early to mid twentieth century. TRH was discovered by Polish endocrinologist Andrew Schally in 1970, contributing in part to his Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea, {{in their}} usual home strip of blue, kicked-off the match and {{immediately}} lost possession when Walcott dispossessed Matic. Walcott sent {{the ball to}} Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, whose cross on the right forced a punch from Thibaut <b>Courtois.</b> Francis Coquelin conceded a free kick in the sixth minute having fouled Willian inside Chelsea's half, though nothing came of the set piece. Fàbregas went down under the challenge of Per Mertesacker in Arsenal's penalty area soon afterwards, but his appeal for a penalty kick was turned down by referee Anthony Taylor and play resumed. Chelsea, having settled the slower of the two teams, began to dominate ball possession and won two early corners, {{both of which were}} easily dealt with. In the 17th minute, Nacho Monreal's charge forward was stopped by Cahill; the Chelsea defender in the process of making that challenge had suffered a nose bleed. A free kick for Arsenal presented a chance for Walcott to score, but his header goalwards was saved.|$|E
5|$|On 15 December 2014, Buffon {{was named}} Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year {{for the ninth}} time in his career, and {{was elected to the}} 2014 Serie A Team of the Year. On 22 December, Juventus were {{defeated}} by Napoli in the 2014 Supercoppa Italiana 8–7 on penalties, following a 2–2 draw after extra-time. Although Buffon made several saves during the match, and managed to stop three penalties in the shoot-out, he was unable to prevent his team from losing the title. Buffon placed fourth in the 2014 IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper Award, behind Manuel Neuer, Thibaut <b>Courtois</b> and Keylor Navas; this was the 15th consecutive year in which he had been named as one of the world's top five goalkeepers. On 15 February 2015, Buffon surpassed Gaetano Scirea as the Juventus player with the second most minutes played in Serie A, behind only Giampiero Boniperti. On 2 March 2015, Buffon equalled Scirea as the Juventus player with the third most appearances in Serie A, behind only Boniperti and Del Piero. He later surpassed Scirea on 14 March, making his 378th Serie A appearance with Juventus in a 1–0 away win over Palermo. After keeping a clean sheet in the second leg of the Champions League quarter-final against Monaco on 22 April, Buffon overtook Dida as the goalkeeper with the fourth-highest number of clean sheets in Champions League history, with 36. On 26 April, Buffon made his 528th appearance for Juventus in all competitions, equalling Giuseppe Furino as the player with third-most appearances for the club; he overtook Furino on 29 April. On 2 May, Buffon kept a clean sheet in a 1–0 away win over Sampdoria, as Juventus won their fourth consecutive Serie A title. On 13 May, Buffon produced a man of the match performance as Juventus drew 1–1 with Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in the second leg of the UEFA Champions League semi-final, only being beaten by a Cristiano Ronaldo penalty; the result allowed Buffon to progress to his second career Champions League final with Juventus, 12 years after his last appearance. On 20 May, he won his first Coppa Italia title with Juventus, despite not featuring throughout the tournament that season. On 23 May, in his 900th career appearance, Buffon saved a Lorenzo Insigne penalty in a 3–1 home win over Napoli in Serie A.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{scored the}} game's only {{goal in the}} 24th minute; set-up by Walcott, Oxlade-Chamberlain managed to cut inside César Azpilicueta {{on the right and}} shoot the ball into the top-left corner of <b>Courtois's</b> net. It was the first goal Chelsea had conceded against Arsenal in 506 minutes. Most of the action in the first half was {{conducted}} in a congested midfield, with Fàbregas attempting to sedate the rhythm and the Arsenal midfielders forcing their opponents to play narrow. This favoured Arsenal, who had space to counter-attack had Chelsea lost the ball. Ramires nearly levelled the scoreline in the 33rd minute, but his curling effort failed to creep into the bottom right-hand corner. Ramires then missed another chance, heading the ball high and over the Arsenal goal after good work by Rémy. Arsenal created another chance to score four minutes before the break, when Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross found Monreal, who under pressure from Ivanovic headed over. Rémy, often a lone figure upfront, was ruled offside late on.|$|R

40|$|The {{principal}} {{question we}} address {{in this work}} is the following: "Is Markov modelling appropriate to analyse data networks?". We will conclude that it is. The motivation for this question comes {{from the work of}} a research team at Bellcore who argue that the models used in teletraffic engineering are questionnable. Their argument is based on long measurements performed on their local network. Their results, with the major conclusion that the traffic is self-similar, have shaken the teletraffic community. After having exposed the principal characteristics of the Markovian model, we analyse measurements done on the EPFL network and on the Bellcore network. The results of the analysis lead us to suspect the suitability of Markovian models. Therefore, we study the interworking unit Ethernet/DQDB considering a network totally loaded. No hypothesis is made for the traffic profile, yet the study leads to strong conclusions and we therefore try to understand the queue behavior with the spectral analysis in order to better characterize the data traffic. The next step consists of reproducing the self-similarity observed in the data traffic with modulated Markov chains. Here, <b>Courtois's</b> theory of decomposability is used. We have shown {{that it is possible to}} reproduce self-similarity on a finite timescale, but that the number of parameters needed to manipulate in the modulated Markov remains large. In the next step, we propose a technique to reduce them drastically. A method of finding a Markov modulated chain as a function of the expectation, the local Hurst parameter and the domain where the process exhibits self-similarity has been developed. Finally, we analyse the statistical multiplexing in a new ATM architecture by comparing the multiplexing of VBR sources (with a modulated Markovian chains) on a CBR and on a VBR connection, using the above techniques...|$|R

40|$|Babblers {{together}} with the close related Timallidae are not very common inmates of the zoological gardens. In the Czech Republic they are only bred in the zoological gardens in Ohrada, Pilsen and Prague. The breeding in the zoological gardens is not generally very successful. The zoo in Prague with its number of species owns the largest collection of these birds in Europe. In the past the breeders in Prague were the first ones in Europe who managed to raise for example Rufous-fronted Laughingthrush, Sunda Laughingthrush, Barred Laughingthrush or Sumatran Laughingthrush (Black-and-white Laughingthrush). As the first ones in the Czech Republic {{they were able to}} reproduce the critically endagered Blue-crowned Laughingthrush (<b>Courtois's</b> Laughingthrush). The Blue-crowned Laughingthrush is so rare that for several years it was not clear at all if they still live in nature. In the year 2000 they were rediscovered in the number of 240 pieces. The quantity of them in the zoological gardens all over the world does not exceed 100 pieces. The zoo in Chester does a European breeding book of these pieces. Some birds in Prague reproduce repetitively and they prove that the right method of the breeding was found. Hopefully this method would lead to the birth of the securing population in the care of humans. This securing population is very important for the protection of these birds. The attempt of this work is to assess the links between the results of the breeding and their conditions, the comparison of the nesting activities of the two chosen species of babblers, then the summarizing of the expansion and the results of the breeding of the individual species and also the processing of the expansion, the development of the quantity and the problems of the protection of the babblers in nature. The following facts were found out: the breeding of the birds in the exposition or in its environment does not have an essential influence on their nesting activity. However, for the nesting activity it is more important if they are a newly formed couple or a couple paired for a longer time and at the forest babbler it is the female that has an important role in incubation period. However, at the Sumatran Laughingthrush there is a frequent changing in different time intervals. The work also shows that only 5 species out of 12, that showed the nesting activity, are able to build a nest without the help of the keepers. That can be attributed to their closer relational breeding and also to putting the higher number of artificially reared individuals into the breeding...|$|R
