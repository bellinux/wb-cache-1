40|$|The {{question}} of applicable law is of essence in discussing {{access to justice}} and legal protection under the WTO dispute settlement system because it determines which disputes are suitable for resolving under the WTO framework. The WTO dispute settlement system is primarily oriented towards protection of rights under the <b>covered</b> <b>agreements.</b> One of the central problem in this discussion is the competence of the WTO judicial bodies (panels and the Appellate Body) to resolve disputes concerning rights and obligations that are not regulated by the <b>covered</b> <b>agreements.</b> According to the rulings of the WTO judicial bodies, they only have jurisdiction to examine <b>covered</b> <b>agreements</b> as the only relevant and applicable law in dispute settlement proceedings. Some scholars support a strict conception of the WTO judicial bodies' jurisdiction pertaining only to the WTO law. Some other authors suggest a more flexible approach, given that the WTO is neither 'a closed legal circuit' nor a self-contained regime. As a branch or a sub-system of Public International Law, the WTO has to interact with other branches or subsystems, such as human rights treaties and international environmental protection agreements. Many scholars and experts insist that the WTO bodies {{must take into account}} the 'new dimensions of international trade', like environmental protection and human rights. Hence, the rules of free trade cannot be legally and politically excommunicated from general international law. Nevertheless, this assertion must be taken with caution: it would be the only way for ensuring protection of security and predictability of the multilateral trading system under the WTO. Therefore, it is important to establish clear borderlines and situations in which interaction with extrinsic sources of law is necessary...|$|R

This provision has been interpreted broadly: for example, several agreements amongst firms with no production in the EU have been considered to affect trade between Member States. In the Webb-Pomerene case, EU law was applied to a US cartel with no production in the EU. The ECJ has also held that [...] "trade between Member States" [...] includes [...] "trade between regions of a Member State", to prevent cartels [...] "carving up" [...] territories for their own benefit.|$|R

This was a conference turned inside-out and on its head, where the informal contacts that arise at any meeting were at its heart, and traditional plenary sessions at the edge. For three days, the building buzzed with 1, 021 one-to-one contacts, officially mediated, plus thousands more informal parleys. Workshops were held on project preparation and monitoring, and, co-organised by the Centre for the Development of Enterprise and CTA, on health and hygiene standards for fish products and on opportunities in the (mainly organic) fruit and vegetable markets, with the COLEACP promotion agency). When not doing their deals, participants went shopping. Not in the nearby médina, but at the supermarket-style Technical Information Centre. There, information suppliers, including CTA, helped clients to locate key data. Other valuable data, including country profiles of the agro-industrial potential in the West African market of 220 million people, is available in Agro-Ind reports and online.

While the provisions of the <b>covered</b> <b>agreements</b> cited by the complainant, Guatemala, were not unique to a WTO dispute, this case raised the puzzling spectre of one RTA member complaining against the other that a provision in their own Free Trade Agreement (FTA) violates the WTO.

40|$|Since 1947, the ‘Most Favoured Nation (MFN) treatment’ {{principle}} {{has been}} the key principle governing trade relations amongst states, especially {{in the context of}} the GATT and the WTO. It plays a key role in liberalising trade by preventing discrimination between goods coming from different countries at national borders. The principle is now enshrined in numerous provisions of multilateral WTO agreements, such as the GATT, the GATS, and the TRIPS Agreement. There is a strong possibility that this provision would be interpreted differently by different countries, particularly in areas that are not directly related to trade such as intellectual property (IP) protection afforded by the TRIPS Agreement. This chapter aims to provide an analysis of the MFN principle under the WTO <b>covered</b> <b>agreements,</b> by focusing specifically on the GATT and the TRIPS Agreement...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} and evaluates, from a comparative perspective, {{the recent developments}} {{in the treatment of}} resale price fixing (RPF) in EU competition law. It inquires whether, as to the treatment of RPF, EU competition law is in line with US antitrust after the changes introduced by the 2010 regulatory package; and demonstrates that considerable differences exist. The paper concludes that the 2010 revision of the rules on vertical restraints somewhat refined but did not reform the law on RPF. The new rules ignore the transaction costs and realities of competition assessment and balancing. It is submitted that in EU competition law the main problem is that, conceptually, the question of RPF has been pushed in the pigeonhole of Article 101 (3). The paper argues that the Notice on Agreements of Minor Importance should be amended so as to <b>cover</b> <b>agreements</b> containing RPF where market share is low...|$|R
