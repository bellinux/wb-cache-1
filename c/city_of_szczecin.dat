40|$|AbstractThe {{main problem}} arising {{in the process}} of {{analysing}} the functioning of the transport and distribution of goods in urban areas is the lack of data on their implementation, in particular with regard to the classification of vehicles, their routes, changes in demand for transport, etc. The paper introduces the methodology and results of analysis of the goods distribution within the <b>city</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>Szczecin</b> in the area covering the significant number of companies, retail and service entities, entities of the HoReCa sector, schools, universities, and public administration.

5000|$|Before its abolition, the {{territory}} of the Kingdom of Prussia included the provinces of West Prussia; East Prussia; Brandenburg; Saxony (including much of the present-day state of Saxony-Anhalt and parts of the state of Thuringia in Germany); Pomerania; Rhineland; Westphalia; Silesia (without Austrian Silesia); Lusatia; Schleswig-Holstein; Hanover; Hesse-Nassau; and a small detached area in the south called Hohenzollern, the ancestral home of the Prussian ruling family. The land that the Teutonic Knights occupied was flat and covered with rich soil. The land was perfectly suited to the large-scale raising of wheat. The rise of early Prussia was based on the raising and selling of wheat. Teutonic Prussia became known as the [...] "bread basket of Western Europe" [...] (in German, Kornkammer, or granary). The port <b>cities</b> <b>of</b> Stettin (<b>Szczecin)</b> in Pomerania, Danzig (Gdańsk) in Prussia, Riga in Livonia, Königsberg (Kaliningrad) and Memel (Klaipėda) rose on the back of this wheat production. Wheat production and trade brought Prussia into close relationship with the Hanseatic League during the period of time from 1356 (official founding of the Hanseatic League) until the decline of the League in about 1500.|$|R
