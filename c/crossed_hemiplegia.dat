30|$|One hundred seventy four {{patients}} (87 %) {{presented with}} manifestations of anterior circulation stroke such as hemiparesis and hemihypothesia, while 26 patients (13 %) presented with manifestations of posterior circulation stroke such as <b>crossed</b> <b>hemiplegia,</b> ataxia, and vertigo. Regarding {{the etiology of}} stroke, 82 (41 %) patients had small vessel disease, 58 (29 %) had large vessel disease, 49 (24.5) had cardio-embolic stroke, 6 (3 %) had ischemic stroke of other determined etiology, and 5 (2.5 %) had stroke of undetermined etiology. The mean NIHSS of stroke cases was (8.9 [*]±[*] 0.58) ranged between 1 and 30.|$|E
40|$|Weber's {{syndrome}} is a distinctive brainstem disease characterized by ipsilateral 3 rd nerve palsy with contralateral hemiplegia and {{is due to}} an intrinsic or extrinsic lesion in the ventral midbrain. To date, there is limited literature concerning Weber's syndrome associated with central facial palsy, but none was demonstrated with comprehensive explanation. We report a rare case presented with Weber’s syndrome and central facial palsy caused by infarction of ventromedial crural region of the mesencephalon. The patient was a 68 -year-old woman who developed central type facial palsy on right side, and complete left 3 rd nerve palsy, right hemiparesis and paresthesia with deep sensory disturbance of right upper and lower extremities. A T 2 weighted cranial MRI showed an acute infarct in the left ventromedial crural region of the mesencephalon and this lesion was presumed to involve both the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts. This report demonstrates an extremely rare case of <b>crossed</b> <b>hemiplegia</b> with oculomotor and facial nerve palsy due to an infarct in {{the upper part of}} the midbrain as documented by the MRI scan. The other interesting feature to note in our report is that the patient completely recovered six months later. This indicates that some of these patients may have a good prognosis.
