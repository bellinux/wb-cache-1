Oil painting allowed for a blending of tones to produce {{a wide range of}} realistic, attractive colors, in a way not possible with traditional <b>Chinese</b> <b>ink</b> and brush painting. [...] Wang admired how, in Moscow museums, Lenin's career was chronicled and made accessible to the masses through artifacts accompanied by {{oil paintings}} showing crucial moments in the Communist leader's career. [...] He and higher-level officials decided to use a similar technique as they planned the Museum of the Chinese Revolution. [...] Thus, they sought to chronicle the Party's history and showcase its accomplishments. [...] Paintings were commissioned, even though the museum did not yet exist and would not open until 1961. [...] Chinese leaders were eager to be presented in paintings, wanting to be immortalized as central characters in the nation's historical drama.|$|E

5000|$|The {{history of}} <b>Chinese</b> <b>inks</b> {{can be traced}} to the 23rd century BC, with the {{utilization}} of natural plant (plant dyes), animal, and mineral inks based on such materials as graphite that were ground with water and applied with ink brushes.

The best inks for drawing or painting on paper or silk are produced from the resin of the pine tree. They must be between 50 and 100 years old. The Chinese inkstick is produced with a fish glue, whereas Japanese glue (膠 [...] "nikawa") is from cow or stag.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{artifacts of}} <b>Chinese</b> <b>inks</b> can be dated back to 12th century BC, {{with the use}} of charred materials, plant dyes, and animal-based inks being occasionally used, with mineral inks being most common.

The mineral origins of <b>Chinese</b> <b>inks</b> were discussed by the Eastern Han dynasty scholar Xu Shen (許慎, 58 - c. 147). In his Shuowen Jiezi, he wrote [...] "Ink, whose semantic component is 'earth', is black." [...] (墨，從土、黑也), indicating that the character for [...] "ink" [...] (墨) is composed of the characters for [...] "black" [...] (黑) and [...] "soil" [...] (土), due to the earthly origins of the dark mineral used in its production.|$|R

60|$|In {{the part}} of the Dionysiac mysteries at which the toys of the child Dionysus were exhibited, and during which (as it seems) the [Greek], or bull-roarer, was whirred, the {{performers}} daubed themselves all over with clay. This we learn from a passage in which Demosthenes describes the youth of his hated adversary, AEschines. The mother of AEschines, he says, was a kind of 'wise woman,' and dabbler in mysteries. AEschines used to aid her by bedaubing the initiate over with clay and bran. {40a} The word [Greek], here used by Demosthenes, is explained by Harpocration as the ritual term for daubing the initiated. A story was told, as usual, to explain this rite. It was said that, when the Titans attacked Dionysus and tore him to pieces, they painted themselves first with clay, or gypsum, that they might not be recognised. Nonnus shows, in several places, that down to his time the celebrants of the Bacchic mysteries retained this dirty trick. Precisely the same trick prevails in the mysteries of savage peoples. Mr. Winwood Reade {40b} reports the evidence of Mongilomba. When initiated, Mongilomba was 'severely flogged in the Fetich House' (as young Spartans were flogged before the animated image of Artemis), and then he was 'plastered over with goat-dung.' Among the natives of Victoria, {40c} the 'body of the initiated is bedaubed with clay, mud, charcoal powder, and filth of every kind.' The girls are plastered with charcoal powder and white clay, answering to the Greek gypsum. Similar daubings were performed at the mysteries by the Mandans, as described by Catlin; and the Zunis made raids on Mr. Cushing's black paint and <b>Chinese</b> <b>ink</b> for like purposes. On the Congo, Mr. Johnson found precisely the same ritual in the initiations. Here, then, not to multiply examples, we discover two singular features in common between Greek and savage mysteries. Both Greeks and savages employ the bull-roarer, both bedaub the initiated with dirt or with white paint or chalk. As to the meaning of the latter very un-Aryan practice, one has no idea. It is only certain that war parties of Australian blacks bedaub themselves with white clay to alarm their enemies in night attacks. The Phocians, according to Herodotus (viii. 27), adopted the same 'aisy stratagem,' as Captain Costigan has it. Tellies, the medicine-man ([Greek]), chalked some sixty Phocians, whom he sent to make a night attack on the Thessalians. The sentinels of the latter were seized with supernatural horror, and fled, 'and after the sentinels went the army.' In the same way, in a night attack among the Australian Kurnai, {41a} 'they all rapidly painted themselves with pipe-clay: red ochre is no use, it cannot frighten an enemy.' If, then, Greeks in the historic period kept up Australian tactics, it is probable that the ancient mysteries of Greece might retain the habit of daubing the initiated which occurs in savage rites.|$|E

50|$|The {{first known}} inks {{were made by}} the Chinese, and date back to the 23rd century B.C. They used natural plant dyes and {{minerals}} such as graphite ground with water and applied with an <b>ink</b> brush. Early <b>Chinese</b> <b>inks</b> similar to the modern inkstick have been found dating to about 256 BC {{at the end of the}} Warring States period. They were produced from soot, usually produced by burning pine wood, mixed with animal glue. To make ink from an inkstick, the stick is continuously ground against an inkstone with a small quantity of water to produce a dark liquid which is then applied with an ink brush. Artists and calligraphists could vary the thickness of the resulting ink by reducing or increasing the intensity and time of ink grinding. These inks produced the delicate shading and subtle or dramatic effects of Chinese brush painting.|$|R
