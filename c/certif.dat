(Dogus Author) [...] Conference full title: 2010 14 th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference (EPE/PEMC 2010) : Ohrid, Macedonia, 6 - 8 September 2010 This paper {{presents}} a novel {{solution to the}} sliding mode output feedback control for uncertain discretetime systems, which is aimed at electronic embedded motion control of implementation designs. The uncertainty is considered mismatched and with an unknown bound, which is identified by the proposed dead-zone adaptive law. The uncertain discrete-time system is made asymptotically stable under the proposed adaptive sliding mode output feedback control, {{which is based on}} the multirate sampling technique. Finally, a numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control strategy. ELEM, Repub. Macedonia Chamb. <b>Certif.</b> Archit. <b>Certif.</b> Eng...|$|E

The usual drawback of control chattering occurred in the classical sliding mode control can be alleviated with the proposed control scheme. Also the robustness of adaptive control system employing neural network is improved to some extent. Simulation investigation for scenario of vehicle activating brakes on dry road situation is carried out using Matlab/Simulink platform. Simulation results demonstrate both feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed ABS control scheme. ELEM, Repub. Macedonia Chamb. <b>Certif.</b> Archit. <b>Certif.</b> Eng...|$|E

(Dogus Author) [...] Conference full title: 2010 14 th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference (EPE/PEMC 2010) : Ohrid, Macedonia, 6 - 8 September 2010 A genetic {{algorithm}} based optimization technique for optimum design of power system damping controller in a multi-machine power {{system has been}} developed. In this technique, the {{genetic algorithm}} involves an objective function {{that is based on}} the integral of squared-time- squared-error criterion. Parameters of the power system stabilizers are tuned via simulation experiments based on a non-linear model of the system. The dynamic performance has been investigated under both small and large disturbance perturbation, and compared with the case of conventional optimization using phase compensation. Simulation experiments have demonstrated the proposed genetic-algorithm optimized power system stabilizers do enhance quality dynamic performance over a wide range of operating conditions by effectively damping both local and inter-area oscillation modes.

A back-propagation artificial neural-network (BP-ANN) genetic algorithm (GA) based optimizing technique for improved accuracy of predictions short term loads is proposed. With GA's optimizing and BP-ANN's dynamic capacity, the weighted GA optimization is realized by selection, crossing and mutation operations. The performance of the proposed technique has been tested using load time-series from a real-world electrical power system. Its prediction has been compared to those of obtained by only backpropagation based neural-network techniques. Simulation results demonstrated that the here proposed technique possesses superior performance thus guarantees better forecasting. ELEM, Repub.

40|$|I Abstract [The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a liquid chromatography-tandem mass {{spectrometry}} (LC-MS-MS) method for the analysis of benzodiazepines in human hair. The method was tested by analyzing hair samples from forensic and clinical psychiatric patients where benzodiazepines had been prescribed during hospitalization and after care. Hair samples were obtained at discharge from the clinic and then after six months. Two-centimeter segments of the hair samples (10 - 30 rag) were washed once with isopropanol, three times with phosphate buffer, and again with isopropanol, dried, weighed, and digested with proteinase K before solid-phase extraction with BondElut <b>Certif...</b>|$|E
40|$|Massive open {{online courses}} (MOOCs) are being {{undertaken}} {{by hundreds of}} thousands of participants globally. Reasons for taking thes e courses vary, such as improving employment prospects, especially in the technology sector, though the impact of these <b>certif</b> icates has not been established. Factors identified as barriers to the acceptance of these certifications include user verification issues and a lack of familiarity of MOOC content. There are positive signs in employers recommending MOOCs for training purposes and a major MOOC platform collaborating with compa nies to provide a work placement scheme. The discussion regarding the value of traditional and online education also applies, as employers are seeking candidates who are technically skilled and ready for work, which is not guaranteed by a traditional degre e certificate. This review provides a baseline collation of current opinion and research. I ndependent qualitative research and further literature review should be conducted to build an evidence base regarding the use of MOOCs and their certificates...|$|E

We explore the experiences of student teachers in the Vaal University of Technology Post-graduate <b>Certif</b> icate in Education (PGCE) during their 10 weeks ’ teaching practice in the Vaal area. In this article we aim to establish {{the ways in which}} these experiences influence the student teachers ’ perception of the teaching profession. Semi-structured interviews with all student teachers were used to collect the data while content analysis was used to identify themes and analyse the data. We established that, despite the positive experiences during teaching practice, student teachers experienced challenges which affected their percep-tion of the teaching profession. Based on the findings of this study, measures are suggested on how to improve teaching practice {{in order to have a}} positive influence on the student teachers ’ perception of, and attitude towards, the tea-ching profession...|$|E

40|$|That {{aldehydes}} {{produce a}} curious effect upon structures stained with basic fuchsin {{has been known}} for some time. Both Goodpasture (6) and Fite (4) demonstrated that organisms which have been stained red with carbol fuchsin and then differentiated with formaldehyde are rendered violet. Fite found this procedure to be successful when acid-fast bacilli were most difficult to stain. Gomori (5), in 1950, reported that basic fuchsin, in the presence of strong mineral acids, forms intensely purplish dyes with certain aldehydes. The dye was referred to as aldehyde-fuchsin and was found to possess useful staining prop-erties. During an investigation on the staining of beta-cell granules in pancreatic islets, it was observed that methyl violet 2 B or crystal violet stained these granules, after selective oxidation, just as intensely as did aldehyde-fuchsin after the same oxidation. Basic fuchsin, methyl violet 2 B, and crystal violet are known basic triphenylmethane dyes which differ structurally in regard to the relative number of open amino groups. It seemed possible, then, that certain aldehydes are capable of reacting with the open amino groups of basic fuchsin to produce a dye similar both structurally and in staining properties to methyl or crystal violet. The present study was undertaken in order to support or disprove this hypothesis regarding the chemical characteristics of Gomori’s paraldehyde-fuchsin dye. PREPARATION OF THE DYE SOLUTIONS The following basic triphenylmethane dyes were used in the present investi-gation: 1. Basic fuchsin (C. I. No. 677; <b>Certif.</b> No. NF- 59; Nat’l.
