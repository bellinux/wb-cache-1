(This standard specifies requirements for an environmental-management system.) BEMS saves time by partly automating what were previously manual processes for creating audit checklists; recording and tracking audit results; issuing, tracking, and implementing corrective-action requests (CARs); tracking continuous improvements (CIs); and tracking audit results and statistics. BEMS consists on an administration module and an auditor module. As its name suggests, the administration module is used to administer the audit. It helps administrators to edit the list of audit questions; edit the list of audit locations; assign manditory questions to locations; track, approve, and edit CARs; and edit <b>completed</b> <b>audits.</b> The auditor module is used by auditors to perform audits and record audit results: It helps the auditors to create <b>audit</b> checklists, <b>complete</b> <b>audits,</b> view <b>completed</b> <b>audits,</b> create CARs, record and acknowledge CIs, and generate reports from audit results...|$|R
