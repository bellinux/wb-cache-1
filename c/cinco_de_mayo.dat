A number of annual events celebrating the state's ethnic and historical heritage take place around the state, such as Days of '76 in Deadwood, Czech Days in Tabor, {{and the annual}} St. Patrick's Day and <b>Cinco</b> <b>de</b> <b>Mayo</b> festivities in Sioux Falls.

Custer State Park holds an annual Buffalo Roundup, in which volunteers on horseback gather the park's herd of around 1,500 bison.|$|E
25|$|The main Mexican holiday is the Day of Independence, {{celebrated on}} September 16. Americans are more {{familiar}} with the <b>Cinco</b> <b>de</b> <b>Mayo.</b> <b>Cinco</b> <b>de</b> <b>Mayo</b> commemorates the date of the Battle of Puebla, in which Díaz participated, when a major victory was won against the French. Under the Porfiriato, the Mexican Consuls in the United States gave <b>Cinco</b> <b>de</b> <b>Mayo</b> more importance than the Day of Independence due to the President's personal involvement in the events. It is still widely celebrated in the United States, although largely due to cultural permeation.|$|E

[...] After her publicity press, Selena was booked to play at several concerts throughout Mexico, including a performance at Festival Acapulco in May 1993, which garnered her critical acclaim. Her performance in Nuevo Leon on September 17, 1993 was attended by 70,000 people, garnering her the title of the biggest Tejano act in Mexico.|$|E
