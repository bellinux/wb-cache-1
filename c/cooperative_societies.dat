5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, Cuban society was highly stratified, {{consisting}} of a Spanish creole ruling class of tobacco, sugar, and coffee plantation owners, a middle class of black and Spanish plantation workers, and an underclass of black slaves. The upper echelons of society were also deeply divided between the creoles and Spaniards (known as peninsulares), with the Spaniards benefiting greatly from the colonial regime. Cuba was a colony of Spain, although there were movements for independence, integration into the U.S., and integration with Spain. The roots of anarchism were first seen in 1857, when a Proudhonian mutualist society was founded. After being introduced to the ideas of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon by José de Jesus Márquez, Saturnino Martínez (an Asturian immigrant to Cuba) founded the periodical La Aurora in 1865. Directed at tobacco workers, it included the earliest advocation of <b>cooperative</b> <b>societies</b> in Cuba. By the Ten Years' War, the insurgents against Spain included expatriates from the Paris Commune, and others influenced by Proudhon, including Salvador Cisneros Betancourt and Vicente García.|$|E

40|$|Community Supported Agriculture and <b>Cooperatives</b> <b>Societies</b> (CSACs) are envisioned as model {{vehicles}} to building and developing communities, especially in rural areas. They are models in preserving and developing local food production systems, {{protecting the environment}} and eradicating poverty {{in support of the}} notion and general understanding, especially in Kenya, that farming as a business should support a middle level lifestyle. Despite the fact that most rural communities in Africa, especially in Kenya, are the producers of products that are consumed by urban dwellers, these communities do not appear to fruitfully gain from their efforts and labour (World Development Indicators, 2009). Although rural communities are knowledgeable, they do not always put their tacit and explicit knowledge into practice to consciously communicate to, and share this knowledge with others and to economically support themselves. Effective knowledge management enables people to combine their efforts and knowledge to economically develop themselves without resorting to hand-outs and donations from the government and well wishers. This paper presents findings from a case study of a community-supported <b>cooperative</b> <b>society.</b> The paper describes how the Nyala Multipurpose <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Society</b> has successfully functioned as the vehicle for social and economic development in a rural community in Central Kenya using funds originally contributed by the members and later raised from milk sales. The <b>cooperative</b> <b>society</b> has also served as a civil society organisation. Data was collected through interviews with key members of the <b>cooperative</b> <b>society</b> and the youth. Families were visited, interviewed and their dairy activities observed. The Nyala Multipurpose <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Society</b> Centre and the cooling plant were visited and operations also observed. Their records were also inspected. The Nyala Multipurpose <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Society</b> has grown from a membership of 2700 in 2005 to 7000 in 2010. The <b>cooperative</b> <b>society</b> is democratically owned and managed by its members. Problems that the <b>cooperative</b> <b>society</b> has endeavoured to solve include poverty among members, youth idleness, poor transport system, lack of good market for their main agricultural product and exploitation by middlemen. The study established that the funds generated by the Nyala <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Society</b> were used to finance the development and installation of a milk cooling plant. The Nyala Multipurpose <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Society</b> is a model that offers useful insight and successful elements that have focused on milk production...|$|R

25|$|Some kibbutzim {{have been}} {{involved}} in legal actions related to their status as kibbutzim. Kibbutz Glil Yam, near Herzliya, petitioned the court regarding privatization. In 1999, eight members of kibbutz Beit Oren applied to the High Court of Justice to order the registrar of <b>cooperative</b> <b>societies</b> to declassify Beit Oren as a kibbutz and reclassify it as a different kind of cooperative society. The petitioners argued that the Kibbutz had dramatically changed its life style, having implemented differential salaries, closing the communal dining room, and privatizing the educational system and other services. These changes did not fit the legal definition of a kibbutz, and in particular, the principle of equality in consumption. Consequently, the registrar of <b>cooperative</b> <b>societies,</b> who has the authority to register and classify <b>cooperative</b> <b>societies,</b> should change the classification of kibbutz Beit Oren. The kibbutz responded that it still maintained the basic principles of a kibbutz, but the changes made were vital to prevent a financial collapse and to improve the economic situation.|$|E

25|$|Termite colonies are {{examples}} of eusocial insects. Eusocial insects are animals that develop large, multigenerational <b>cooperative</b> <b>societies</b> that assist {{each other in the}} rearing of young, often at the cost of an individual’s life or reproductive ability. Such altruism is explained in that eusocial insects benefit from giving up reproductive ability of many individuals to improve the overall fitness of closely related offspring. Hamilton’s rule is the key to explaining this phenomenon, where altruism is justified evolutionarily when the benefit to the individual receiving the help, weighted by the relatedness to said individual, outweighs the cost to the organism being altruistic.|$|E
25|$|It was {{feared that}} {{legitimate}} non-banking financial companies and micro finance institutions would be stigmatised, {{leading to a}} vicious cycle of low depositor trust, higher interest rates, lower lending and a localised credit crisis. Because most of the Saradha Group depositors came from the lowest economic strata, {{the loss of the}} investment would cause a further decrease in social mobility. The scandal drew attention to similar illegal deposit mobilising companies, which are facing increased regulatory pressure. Many of these companies have been variations of time share travel schemes, of which there are few clear regulations. These companies tried to register as <b>cooperative</b> <b>societies</b> to continue their financial operations.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1894, when his {{campaign}} reached a size {{too big to}} be directed by a few individuals, Plunkett founded the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society (IAOS), with Lord Monteagle, Thomas A. Finlay and others. Robert A Anderson acted as secretary, with AE and PJ Hannon his assistants. IAOS soon became the powerhouse of co-operation, with 33 affiliated dairy <b>cooperative</b> <b>societies</b> and cooperative banks, introducing co-operation among Irish farmers by proving the benefits obtainable through more economical and efficient management. The following year he and Russell began publishing its journal The Irish Homestead to spread information on farming. Four years later there were 243 affiliated societies. Within a decade 800 societies were in existence, with a trade turnover of three million pounds sterling.|$|E

However, the {{discharged}} employees then took over the branches, {{under the leadership of}} the then communist leader A. K. Gopalan and renamed the network as Indian Coffee House. The first Indian Coffee Workers Co-Operative Society was established in Bengaluru on 19 August 1957. The first Indian Coffee House was opened in New Delhi on 27 October 1957. Gradually, the Indian Coffee House chain expanded across the country, with branches in Pondicherry, Thrissur, Lucknow, Nagpur, Jabalpur, Mumbai, Kolkata, Tellicherry and Pune Tamil Nadu by the end of 1958. These coffee houses in the country are run by 13 <b>cooperative</b> <b>societies,</b> which are governed by managing committees elected from the employees.

2500|$|Within that context, Bogatyrets {{emerged as}} a figure of {{importance}} among the Bukovina Russophiles (or [...] "Old Ruthenians"). The faction was led by Orthodox theologian Eugene Hakman and scholar Jevhen Kozak; its adversaries were [...] "Ukrainophiles", Greek Catholics, and modernizing [...] "Young Ruthenians" [...] such as Hierotheus Pihuliak and Nikolai von Wassilko. The Russophile movement {{as a whole was}} discouraged by the Austrian administrators, who backed the Pihuliak faction. When Bogatyrets applied for a lecturer's chair at his alma mater, he received a veto from the Austrian officials and Metropolitan Arcadie. He continued his ministry, receiving commendation. In 1901, he rose to the position of parish priest, and, in this capacity, began a long-lasting career in popular education and political activism, establishing reading rooms and <b>cooperative</b> <b>societies,</b> and spreading Russophile ideas among his parishioners.|$|E

This drive of the SDF to unite with various non-Marxist organizations brought about an immediate reaction from the party's hardline [...] "impossibilist" [...] left wing, who sought revolutionary transformation rather than incremental, piecemeal parliamentary reforms. The rise of the left caused Hyndman to temporarily leave the SDF's executive council and alienated Spargo to some extent from the party. Providentially, Spargo received at this time an invitation from the private lecture bureau to travel to America to spend a couple months traveling the country, speaking about socialism. And so the newlyweds sailed for America and ultimately a new life there.|$|E
2500|$|With {{more than}} half the {{population}} being rural, agriculture and allied industries {{play an important role in}} the states's economy. The agriculture and allied activities sector contributes 12.9% to the state's income. Staples such as rice and millet are the main monsoon crops. Important cash crops include sugarcane, cotton, oilseeds, tobacco, fruit, vegetables and spices such as turmeric. [...] Animal husbandry is an important agriculture related activity. The State's share in the livestock and poultry population in India is about 7% and 10% respectively. Maharashtra was a pioneer in the development of Agricultural <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Societies</b> after independence. In fact, it was an integral part of the then Governing Congress party's vision of ‘rural development with local initiative’. A ‘special’ status was accorded to the sugar cooperatives and the government assumed the role of a mentor by acting as a stakeholder, guarantor and regulator, Apart from sugar, Cooperatives play a crucial role in dairy, cotton, and fertiliser industries.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th century, like many other {{industrial}} towns, a <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Society</b> was formed in Mexborough. This was modelled on the consumer cooperative set up by the Rochdale Pioneers in 1844. In 1861 nine working men met together at the home of James Simpson in Mexborough and decided to form the Mexborough Working Men's Industrial Society (later renamed as the Mexborough <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Society).</b> The aim of the Society was to supply (at first to the nine men themselves) the necessary things of life. Membership quickly grew and by the 1890s it stood at 1,200. In its heyday, there were ten shops which were to be found in every built up area of Mexborough. By 1903 land had been purchased in the middle of Mexborough on which to build a large and grand new central store, but then suddenly in 1904 the Mexborough <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Society</b> went into liquidation. Soon after they were taken over by the Barnsley British Co-operative Society.One of Mexborough's landmarks is closely associated with the <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Society.</b> This is the former Barnsley British <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Society</b> flour mill which stands on the north side of the River Don Navigation close to the Church of St John the Baptist. It started off as the [...] "Don Roller Mills". It was owned by James White who sold it to the Barnsley British <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Society</b> in 1912.|$|R
