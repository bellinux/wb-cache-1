40|$|The {{hydrogeology}} of {{the northeastern}} part of Mt Xishan {{has historically been}} interpreted {{in terms of a}} simple unconfined aquifer model. The groundwater required is characterized by (1) karst terrain, (2) multilayered unconfined groundwater flow developed in block mountains involving rapid hanging discharges and (3) deep confined groundwater with a <b>carbon</b> <b>14</b> <b>age</b> of 1000 - 2800 years and low tritium content. The flows are partly towards the southern part of Mt Xishan, partly east towards the porous aquifers of the Nitun Basin and partly discharging through the Lancun Spring system. The spatial structure of karst aquifers in block mountains i elucidated by an understanding of stratigraphic, structural, lithological, climatic and karst geomorphological evolution. The actual complex hydrogeological conditions in the Mt Xishan area considered are demonstrated bya comprehensive model proposed by the author. Such a model may also be applied in other karstic block mountains...|$|E

40|$|The {{observed}} excess <b>carbon</b> <b>14</b> in {{the atmosphere}} from 1963 to 1970 provides unique, but limited, data up to an altitude of about 35 km for testing the air motions calculated by 11 multidimensional atmospheric models. Strontium 90 measurements {{in the atmosphere}} from 1964 to mid- 1967 provide data that have more latitude coverage than those of <b>carbon</b> <b>14</b> and are useful for testing combined models of air motions and aerosol settling. Model calculations for <b>carbon</b> <b>14</b> begin at October 1963, 9 months after {{the conclusion of the}} nuclear bomb tests; the initial conditions for the calculations are derived by three methods, each of which agrees fairly well with measured <b>carbon</b> <b>14</b> in October 1963 and each of which has widely different values in regions of the stratosphere where there were no <b>carbon</b> <b>14</b> measurements. The model results are compared to the stratospheric measurements, not as if the observed data were absolute standards, but in an effort to obtain new insight about the models and about the atmosphere. The measured <b>carbon</b> <b>14</b> vertical profiles at 31 deg N are qualitatively different from all of the models; the measured vertical profiles show a maximum mixing ratio in the altitude range of 20 to 25 km from October 1963 through July 1966, but all modeled profiles show mixing ratio maxima that increase in altitude from 20 km in October 1963 to greater than 40 km by April 1966. Both <b>carbon</b> <b>14</b> and strontium 90 data indicate that the models differ substantially among themselves with respect to stratosphere-troposphere exchange rate, but the modeled <b>carbon</b> <b>14</b> stratospheric residence times indicate that differences among the models are small with respect to transport rate between the middle stratosphere and the lower stratosphere. Strontium 90 data indicate that aerosol settling is important up to at least 35 km altitude. Relative to the measurements, about three quarters of the models transport <b>carbon</b> <b>14</b> from the lower stratosphere to the troposphere too rapidly, and all models with all three sets of initial conditions appear to sweep <b>carbon</b> <b>14</b> out of the midstratosphere (above 28 km) much more slowly than was observed from 1963 to 1970. Atmospheric dynamicists should seriously consider that the <b>carbon</b> <b>14</b> measurements imply with respect to advection in the midstratosphere...|$|R

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} describing the factors and processes which determine the measured C- <b>14</b> <b>ages</b> of soil calcium carbonate. Pedogenic carbonate forms in isotopic equilium with soil CO 2. Carbon dioxide in soils {{is a mixture}} of CO 2 derived from two biological sources: respiration by living plant roots and respiration of microorganisms decomposing soil humus. The relative proportion of these two CO 2 sources can greatly affect the initial C- 14 content of pedogenic carbonate: the greater the contribution of humus-derived CO 2, the greater the initial C- <b>14</b> <b>age</b> of the carbonate mineral. For any given mixture of CO 2 sources, the steady-state (14) CO 2 distribution vs. soil depth can be described by a production/diffusion model. As a soil <b>ages,</b> the C- <b>14</b> <b>age</b> of soil humus increases, as does the steady-state C- <b>14</b> <b>age</b> of soil CO 2 and the initial C- <b>14</b> <b>age</b> of any pedogenic carbonate which forms.

The model provides a satisfactory simulation of the observed data. Due to the impulsive nature of its source, initial distributions of excess <b>carbon</b> <b>14</b> exhibit large spatial gradients. This permits important constraints on the range of transport coefficients in the lower stratosphere to be derived. The standard model uses the circulation and eddy diffusivity of the year 1980. Large deviations (by factor of 2) from this standard transport are ruled out by our model. A self-consistently derived K_(yy) which is small (∼ 10 ^ 9 cm^ 2 s^(− 1)) in tropical regions, but is larger (∼ 10 ^(10) cm^ 2 s^(− 1)) at higher latitudes is preferred.

40|$|Paleosols contain {{information}} about the rates of soil organic carbon turnover when the soil was actively forming. However, this temporal information {{is often difficult to}} interpret without tight stratigraphic control on the age of the paleosol. Here we apply ramped pyrolysis/oxidation (Ramped PyrOx) C- 14 analyses to evaluate age spectra of transgressive early Holocene paleosols from the Mississippi Delta in southeastern Louisiana, USA. We find C- <b>14</b> <b>age</b> spectra from soil organic matter (SOM) in both paleosols and overlying basal peats that represent variability in age that is close to, or only slightly greater than, analytical uncertainty of C- 14 measurements, despite different sources of carbon with likely disparate ages. Such age spectra have not previously been observed in the sedimentary record. Here they indicate vigorous soil carbon turnover prior to burial, which homogenized C- <b>14</b> <b>ages</b> within SOM across the entire thermochemical spectrum. The weighted bulk C- <b>14</b> <b>ages</b> from Ramped PyrOx of paleosols and overlying peats are identical within analytical and process-associated uncertainty, and corroborate C- <b>14</b> <b>ages</b> from charcoal fragments and plant macrofossils from the overlying peat. The youngest ages from Ramped PyrOx age spectra may also potentially be applied as chronometers for stratigraphic burial ages. Our results suggest rapid turnover (<< 300 years) of carbon in these soils relative to input of allochthonous carbon, indicating that the C- <b>14</b> <b>age</b> of different soil components is decoupled from thermochemical stability and instead reflects vigorous turnover processes. The concurrence of paleosol and peat C- <b>14</b> <b>ages</b> also suggests that pedogenic processes were linked with the development of coastal marshes, and that the priming effect potentially masked the signal of allochthonous carbon inputs during sea level rise...|$|R
