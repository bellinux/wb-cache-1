5|$|Generally, in {{cabinets}} or display <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> entirely or partially made of wood, the hydrolysis of {{acetyl groups}} in the wood hemicelluloses creates acetic acid. The {{rate at which the}} acetic acid is produced is proportional to the concentration of esters in the wood, the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment. Acidic fumes can also be released from formaldehyde which can occur in wood as a degradation product of lignin. Acidic fumes can also be given off from ubiquitous formaldehyde resins (commonly urea-formaldehyde resins).|$|E
5|$|The {{powers of}} the OSC derive from the Oregon Constitution’s Article VII. Like other supreme courts in the United States, the Oregon Supreme Court acts {{primarily}} as a court of appeals. They choose <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> of legal significance or to unify lower court decisions. In this aspect the court has discretionary review over many of the cases appealed to the high court. Discretionary review allows the court to choose which cases it will hear on appeal. With those <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> denied {{an appeal to the}} Supreme Court, the decision of the lower court becomes final and binding. As of 1995, the court only accepted one in eight appeals that were discretionary. The justices meet once per week in a formal conference in which only the justices are involved to determine rulings. Once a case is accepted, the court hears the case en banc. That is the court is not divided into panels, and instead all justices participate in all the cases, unless a justice recuses themselves due to a conflict of interest or other concern.|$|E
30|$|Figure 3 {{also shows}} that the {{participation}} of lawyers in settlements is larger. This indicates that some lawyers have only participated in <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> have <b>been</b> settled through an agreement. Also note that {{the tail of the}} distribution of participation in <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> lost is heavier than participation in <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> won. Intuitively, it is more “easy” (common) to lose a case than to win a case. In addition, the tail of the distribution of participation of lawyers in <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> settled is even heavier—it is more “easy” (common) to settle a case than to lose a case. This analysis indicates that lawyers do participate in many cases both winning and losing, and thus this could give rise to an interesting network.|$|R

One example is telling whether a given network of interacting (asynchronous and non-deterministic) finite-state machines can reach a deadlock. This problem is PSPACE-complete, i.e., it is decidable, but it is not likely that there is an efficient (centralised, parallel or distributed) algorithm that solves the problem in the case of large networks.|$|E
25|$|DPI {{usually is}} managed {{medically}} with nasogastric intubation every 1–2 hours to relieve gastric pressure secondary to reflux, and aggressive fluid support to maintain hydration and correct electrolyte imbalances. Horses are often withheld food for several days. Use of anti-inflammatory, anti-endotoxin, anti-microbial, and prokinetic drugs are common with this disease. Surgery {{may be needed}} to rule out obstruction or strangulation, and in <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> long-standing to perform a resection and anastomosis of the diseased bowel. Survival rates for DPJ are 25-94%, and horses in the southeast United States appear to be more severely affected.|$|E
25|$|When {{previously}} fired {{cases are}} used, {{they must be}} inspected before loading. <b>Cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> dirty or tarnished are often polished in a tumbler to remove oxidation and allow easier inspection of the case. Cleaning in a tumbler will also clean the interior of cases, which is often considered important for handloading high-precision target rounds. Cracked necks, non-reloadable cases (steel, aluminum, or Berdan primed cases), and signs of head separation are all reasons to reject a case. Cases are measured for length, and any that are over the recommended length are trimmed down to the minimum length. Competition shooters will also sort cases by brand and weight to ensure consistency.|$|E

25|$|Competition {{shooters}} {{also often}} sort bullets by weight, often down to 0.10 grain (6.5mg) increments. The bullet {{is placed in}} the case mouth by hand, and then seated with the press. At this point, the expanded case mouth is also sized back down. A crimp can optionally be added, either by the seating die or with a separate die. Taper crimps are used for <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> held in the chamber by the case mouth, while roll crimps may be used for cases that headspace on a rim or on the cartridge neck. Roll crimps hold the bullet far more securely, and are preferred in situations, such as magnum revolvers, where recoil velocities are significant. A tight crimp also helps to delay the start of the bullet's motion, which can increase chamber pressures, and help develop full power from slower burning powders (see internal ballistics).|$|E
25|$|The Indiana Supreme Court {{is made up}} of five judges with a Court of Appeals {{composed}} of 15judges. The governor selects judges for the supreme and appeal courts from a group of applicants chosen by a special commission. After serving for two years, the judges must acquire the support of the electorate to serve for a 10-year term. In nearly all cases, the Supreme Court does not have original jurisdiction and can only hear <b>cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> petitioned to the court following being heard in lower courts. Local circuit courts are where the majority of cases begin with a trial and the consequence decided by the jury. The Supreme Court does have original and sole jurisdiction in certain specific areas including the practice of law, discipline or disbarment of Judges appointed to the lower state courts, and supervision over the exercise of jurisdiction by the other lower courts of the State.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the case}} {{is the single most}} {{expensive}} part of a loaded round, the more times a case can be re-used, the better. <b>Cases</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> loaded to a moderate pressure will generally last longer, as they will not be work hardened or flow under pressure as much as cases loaded to higher pressures. Use of moderate pressure loads extends the life of the case significantly, not to mention saving quite a bit of wear and tear on the barrel. Work hardening can cause cracks to occur in the neck as the hardened brass loses its malleability, and is unable to survive swaging back into shape during the resizing operation. Rifle brass tends to flow towards the neck (this is why rifle brass must be trimmed periodically) and this takes brass away {{from the rear of the}} case. Eventually, this will show as a bright ring near the base of the cartridge, just in front of the thick web of brass at the base. If brass is used after this ring appears, it risks a crack, or worse, a complete head separation, which will leave the forward portion of the brass lodged in the chamber of the gun. This generally requires a special stuck case removal tool to extract, so it is very undesirable to have a head separation.|$|E
