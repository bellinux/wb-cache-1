500|$|Whether true or not, the CIA's {{exploding}} cigar assassination plot {{inspired the}} cover of the October 1963 issue (#82) of Mad Magazine. Conceived by Al Jaffee, the cover (pictured at right) bears the headline, [...] "You'll Get a BANG out of this issue of Mad Magazine", and features a painting by Norman Mingo depicting Castro in the act of lighting a cigar wrapped with a <b>cigar</b> <b>band</b> on which is drawn Alfred E. Neuman with his fingers plugging his ears, awaiting the explosion. An exploding cigar is also featured on the poster for the Channel 4 British Documentary, 638 Ways to Kill Castro, which shows Castro with a cigar in his mouth that has a fuse projecting from the end and a lit match approaching. An exploding cigar was tested on a season 2 episode of Deadliest Warrior, KGB vs. CIA. The cigar completely destroyed the upper and lower jaw of a gel head but was determined to be very unreliable due to its timed fuse and small explosive payload.|$|E
2500|$|The words SANTA FE {{were applied}} in yellow in a 5"–high {{extended}} font, and {{centered on the}} nose was the [...] "Santa Fe" [...] box logo (initially consisting of a blue cross, circle, and square painted on a solid bronze sheet, but subsequently changed to baked steel sheets painted bronze with the blue identifying elements applied on top). Three thin, pale yellow stripes (known as Cat Whiskers) extended from the nose logo around the cab sides. In January, 1951, Santa Fe revised the scheme to consist of three yellow stripes running up the nose, {{with the addition of}} a blue and yellow <b>Cigar</b> <b>Band</b> (similar in size and shape to that applied to passenger units); the blue background and elongated yellow [...] "SANTA FE" [...] lettering were retained.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cigar</b> <b>bands</b> in {{the early}} 20th Century were precut by the printer and {{generally}} were shipped in bundles of 100. Bands were applied by hand {{as one of the}} final stages of the production process, with the cigarmaker generally backing the band with a dab of plant-based glue to hold it in place on the finished <b>cigar.</b> <b>Bands</b> produced in Europe were typically carefully designed to match packaging motiffs while in the United States many bands bore to the boxes or inner paper in which they were packaged.|$|R
50|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th Century an {{estimated}} four out of five American men smoked cigars, with production handled in literally hundreds of factories. Product differentiation became very important in the fiercely competitive marketplace as makers struggled to win and keep market share. With the cost of production of <b>cigar</b> <b>bands</b> approximately 70 cents per thousand, the use of colorful maker's marks became an important tool for building brand identities. Historians estimate that approximately 2 billion <b>cigar</b> <b>bands</b> were sold in the United States in the year 1900 alone.|$|R

50|$|A <b>cigar</b> <b>band</b> is a loop made {{of paper}} or foil fitted {{around the body}} of a cigar to denote its brand or variety. Although origins of the device are the subject of several legends, modern historians credit a European {{immigrant}} to Cuba named Gustave Bock with invention of the <b>cigar</b> <b>band</b> in the 1830s. Within two decades, banding of cigars exported from Havana became almost universal.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{a series of}} <b>cigar</b> <b>bands</b> commemorating {{important}} figures of the 19th century included Henry Eckford along with industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, merchant and yachtsman Sir Thomas Lipton, inventor Samuel F. B. Morse, and industrialist and philanthropist Cornelius Vanderbilt.|$|R
50|$|From the 1920s {{through much}} of the 20th century <b>cigar</b> <b>bands</b> tended to become more utilitarian, owing to the spread of low cost four-color {{printing}} and the growth of cigarettes, which dramatically reduced the number of cigar manufacturers and their need for brand differentiation.|$|R

50|$|Felipe Jesus Consalvos (1891-c. 1960) was a Cuban-American cigar roller and artist, {{known for}} his posthumously {{discovered}} body of art work based on the vernacular tradition of <b>cigar</b> <b>band</b> collage.|$|E
50|$|The brand {{bears the}} company owner's {{signature}} on the <b>cigar</b> <b>band</b> and box. Nicaraguan grown, the filler is a Cuban-seed “Corojo ‘99” blend, the wrapper is a Colorado leaf. The cigars are celloed and packed in boxes of 25. Each box is dated.|$|E
50|$|Their use {{remains very}} much a part of modern cigar production, with a recent trend towards larger and more {{elaborate}} designs in evidence. Cigar bands are considered a collectible by some people today, with collectors organized into a group called the International Label, Seal and <b>Cigar</b> <b>Band</b> Society.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cigar</b> <b>bands</b> {{were also}} used as a {{primitive}} form of trading stamps by some cigarmakers of the early 20th Century, {{with at least one}} company producing an illustrated catalog replete with premiums which could be received in exchange for dozens, hundreds, or thousands of its bands.|$|R
5000|$|With {{advances}} in printing technology, <b>cigar</b> <b>bands</b> became brighter and more pictorial as the 19th Century {{drew to a}} close. The bands and box art printed from 1890 to 1920 are today {{considered to be a}} product of the [...] "Golden Age" [...] of cigar-related artwork.|$|R
50|$|The {{origin of}} the use of <b>cigar</b> <b>bands</b> is steeped in myth. One legend has it that Russian Tsaritsa Catherine the Great took cigars wrapped in silk so as not to stain her fingers, with members of her court {{beginning}} to wrap <b>cigars</b> in fabric <b>bands</b> in emulation of the queen. Similarly, tales have been told of paper <b>bands</b> used on <b>cigars</b> exported to England to prevent the staining of gentlemen's white gloves.|$|R
50|$|Vintage {{and modern}} cigar bands are {{collected}} today, with collectors joined into {{an organization called}} the International Label, Seal and <b>Cigar</b> <b>Band</b> Society. The largest collection of bands was accumulated by American collector Joe Hruby, listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for a collection of over 165,000 distinct varieties of bands — although that number had ballooned to over 221,000 varieties by 1999.|$|E
50|$|One of Cuba's great {{baseball}} teams was the Club Habana team who played as the Habana Leones (Havana Lions). They were nicknamed los Rojos ("The Reds"), {{which was the}} team color. This brand commemorates and celebrates this great Cuban baseball team, and the color theme is carried over to the <b>cigar</b> <b>band,</b> which is red with gold lettering. The brand consists of a single range of seven vitolas.|$|E
5000|$|After an {{exhaustive}} search, Carl selects Jacksonville FL, {{as the new}} site of the headquarters.The country's first [...] "fresh work" [...] rolling machines turn on at the Jacksonville headquarters, mass-producing cigars that are superior in uniformity, appearance, and quality. Swisher then became the first to wrap individual cigars in cellophane, {{and the first to}} come up with a simple device for removing the cellophane by pulling the <b>cigar</b> <b>band.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Cabinet {{selection}} cigars generally come packaged without cellophane, and (especially when {{purchased in}} 50s) often {{come in the}} wooden box tied together in a bundle with a silk ribbon with the maker's name and the cigar model stated on the silk ribbon. Sometimes they come without <b>cigar</b> <b>bands</b> (occasionally referred to as [...] "naked").|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cigar</b> <b>bands</b> were {{sometimes}} collected by children during the so-called [...] "Golden Age" [...] of cigar art {{due to their}} varied and colorful nature and their ready availability. The bright bands {{were sometimes}} collected and combined into collage art by scrapbookers — surviving specimens of which are eagerly sought today by collectors of folk art.|$|R
50|$|Former {{managers}} at El Laguito {{have claimed that}} the Davidoff blend was very similar to Cohíba, though with a lighter wrapper leaf. The bands used on Davidoff cigars themselves are of the same format that personalized diplomatic <b>cigar</b> <b>bands</b> had been in previous years. Adriano Martínez, a former executive of Habanos SA, confirmed in Min Ron Nee's Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Post-Revolution Havana Cigars that the Cohíba Línea 1492 was made {{to fill the gap}} left by the discontinuation of Davidoff.|$|R
50|$|The {{matter of}} whether to leave a <b>cigar</b> <b>band</b> on while the cigar is being smoked {{is a matter of}} some debate. In Great Britain bands have been {{traditionally}} removed, the retention of the brand names being commonly considered a form of impolite boasting by one smoker amongst his fellows. Elsewhere, whether or not one retains the band while the cigar is being smoked is deemed a matter of personal preference.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "head" [...] of {{the cigar}} {{is usually the}} end closest to the <b>cigar</b> <b>band.</b> The {{opposite}} end of the cigar is called the [...] "foot". The band identifies the type of the cigar and may be removed or left on. The smoker cuts the cap from the head of the cigar and ignites the foot of the cigar. The smoker draws smoke from the head of the cigar with the mouth and lips, usually not inhaling into the lungs.|$|E
50|$|These fanciful {{theories}} aside, cigar historians credit Dutch-born cigarmaker Gustave Bock {{with the}} invention of the <b>cigar</b> <b>band</b> in the 1830s, when he ordered paper rings with his signature on them placed on every cigar intended for export to Europe. In this way, an indication of quality and prestige would be lent to Bock's products, he believed. By the middle of the 1850s, virtually all Cuban cigarmakers were banding their exported cigars, registering their marks with the government and urging consumers to insist on banded products.|$|E
5000|$|Richard Marquis {{was born}} on September 17, 1945, in Bumble Bee, Arizona, [...] the second son of an {{itinerant}} grocery-store worker and a ceramics-hobbying mother. Marquis {{and his older brother}} were the first persons in his parents' families to finish high school, and {{he was the first to}} attend college. As a child he began a life-long absorption with collecting found and scavenged objects in categories (<b>cigar</b> <b>bands,</b> bottle caps), though the collections disappeared each time the family moved. He also engaged in building hobby models.|$|R
5000|$|Very {{little is}} known about this Dunhill-exclusive brand. It is {{believed}} to have been introduced sometime in the 1970s and produced in the Partagás Factory. The name may be a reference to the signature [...] "White Spot" [...] of inset ivory on the shank of every Dunhill smoking pipe, as one of the meanings of the Spanish word punto is [...] "dot" [...] or [...] "point". The same [...] "White Spot" [...] also appeared on Dunhill-exclusive <b>cigar</b> <b>bands,</b> up until the creation of the Dunhill cigar itself.|$|R
500|$|Lithograph {{copies of}} September Morn were mass-produced for popular sale, {{extending}} {{the success that}} followed the scandal, and were widely hung in private homes. Reproductions were featured {{on a variety of}} products, including <b>cigar</b> <b>bands,</b> postcards, bottle openers, statuettes, watch fobs, and candy boxes; the model was also popular as a tattoo. September Morn was the first nude used for calendars, and by the late 1950s it had featured on millions. A couplet referring to Chabas's work, [...] "Please don't think I'm bad or bold, but where its deep it's awful cold", was widely circulated.|$|R
50|$|Being a {{globally}} marketed brand, Hoyo de Monterrey {{has been}} chosen for Habanos' annual Edición Limitada releases since 2000. The Particular had some production problems {{during the first}} Edición Limitada line-up in 2000, with few of the cigars getting out to vendors. This prompted Habanos to release it again the next year, the only Edición Limitada cigar so far to have had this happen. In 2004, a new size {{was added to the}} Hoyo de Monterrey line, the Petit Robusto, which also wore a slightly redesigned Hoyo de Monterrey <b>cigar</b> <b>band.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{fountain}} pens have a wide, two toned gold-plated and steel nib that fans {{out at the}} base and tapers to a fine point, decorated with an Art Deco styled engraving. The gold plated pen-clip carries the Waterman hexagon seal and flows {{from the top of}} the cap. The ebony black crown contrasts with the gold-plated ring around the barrel which resembles an engraved <b>cigar</b> <b>band.</b> There are three other bands on the barrel and cap as vestiges of traditional fountain pen design, which used these rings to limit cracking.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cigar</b> <b>band</b> has {{an overall}} maroon background, with {{elaborate}} gold borders and scrollwork. The left wing has the words [...] "Little Havana (brk) Miami" [...] in gold; {{the right wing}} terminates in an elaborate monogram [...] "P" [...] and has also the words [...] "Cuban Crafted" [...] with the lot number below it, both in gold. The center has the elaborate Padilla monogram at the apex, below that is [...] "Padilla", below that is [...] "Signature (in script)" [...] and below that is [...] "1932." [...] At {{the bottom of the}} center is the Cuban coat of arms.|$|E
50|$|Besides the diocesan {{committees}} {{another important}} branch {{was formed by}} the Boniface collecting societies. The first of these was founded in 1885 among the merchants of Paderborn by the Marist congregation; this branch of the association was designed {{to care for the}} religious training of Catholic children in non-Catholic communities, by the founding of orphan asylums and institutions where children are prepared for their first communion, funded by the collection and sale of objects of little value in themselves, such trifles as tin-foil, old postage stamps, clothing, leaden seals, old coins, books, <b>cigar</b> <b>bands</b> and - tips. Related to the Boniface Association was the Academic Boniface Association.|$|R
50|$|A {{large body}} of Consalvos' art work was {{discovered}} in 1983 at a Philadelphia garage sale. The body of work consists of over 800 collages on paper, found photographs, musical instruments, furniture, and other objects. Consalvos' playful and often subversively political work—on which he {{is thought to have}} collaborated with his son, Jose Felipe Consalvos -- appropriated <b>cigar</b> <b>bands</b> and cigar-box paper, along with magazine images, family photographs, postage stamps, and cut-up money. Following extensive conservation work, Consalvos' work was first exhibited in a solo show in 2004 at Fleisher/Ollman Gallery in Philadelphia. Subsequently, his work has appeared in a number of public exhibitions and collections, including the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the American Folk Art Museum, and the Art Institute of Chicago.
