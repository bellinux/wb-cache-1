40|$|The {{problem of}} {{scheduling}} {{two classes of}} real-time traffic with correlated time constraints is considered.

40|$|Abstract — A {{number of}} schemes have been {{proposed}} for providing differentiated QoS in optical burst-switched (OBS) networks. Most existing schemes {{are based on a}} relative QoS model in which the service requirements for a given <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> are defined relative to the service requirements of another <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic.</b> In this paper, we propose an absolute QoS model that provides an upper-bound guarantee on the loss probability for the guaranteed traffic. We describe two mechanisms for providing loss guarantees at OBS core nodes: an early drop mechanism, which probabilistically drops non-guaranteed traffic, and a wavelength grouping mechanism, which reserves wavelengths for guaranteed traffic. It is shown that combining these two mechanisms outperforms other approaches in providing loss guarantees, while also reducing the loss for non-guaranteed traffic. We then discuss admission control and resource provisioning for OBS networks, and propose a path clustering technique to further improve the network throughput. We develop analytical loss models for the different proposed approaches and verify the results by simulation...|$|E

The PMIPv 6 network is modeled as an M/M/m/m tandem queuing network with two types (<b>classes)</b> <b>of</b> arrival process and an analytical model is presented.

We use results from the effective bandwidth of the output processes (see Chang and Thomas (1995)) to derive simple and asymptotically exact call-admission policies for such a system to guarantee the cell-loss requirements for the different classes assuming that each source produces a single class traffic.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{multi-cell}} analytic model for multi-class cellular networks. We investigate the effects subscriber mobility has on bandwidth control strategies when the network supports multiple classes of subscribers having different bandwidth requirements. We introduce control strategies from non-mobile networks and examine them in a mobile environment. The expressions for call blocking using these control strategies have product form solutions. This allows us to develop a multi-cell, multi-class, model by generalizing on the Erlang fixed point approximation using generalized multi-rate, multi-class, Erlang loss formulas for each <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic.</b> We produce expressions for originating calls lost, hand-off calls lost, forced-termination, and mean channel occupancy for each <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> in each cell for different control strategies.
