40|$|The {{bottleneck}} of convolutional {{neural networks}} (<b>CNN)</b> for <b>medical</b> imaging {{is the number}} of annotated data required for training. Manual segmentation is considered to be the "gold-standard". However, medical imaging datasets with expert manual segmentation are scarce as this step is time-consuming and expensive. We propose in this work the use of what we refer to as silver standard masks for data augmentation in deep-learning-based skull-stripping also known as brain extraction. We generated the silver standard masks using the consensus algorithm Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE). We evaluated CNN models generated by the silver and gold standard masks. Then, we validated the silver standard masks for CNNs training in one dataset, and showed its generalization to two other datasets. Our results indicated that models generated with silver standard masks are comparable to models generated with gold standard masks and have better generalizability. Moreover, our results also indicate that silver standard masks could be used to augment the input dataset at training stage, reducing the need for manual segmentation at this step...|$|R

We can use such algorithm in a medical diagnosisassistance system, to process and analyze computertomography images or in a system developed to assistpeople with visual impairments in moving. An analogchip for CNN computing is very expensive, but anFPGA hardware is not so expensive and is morepopular. Now we can implement the correlationalgorithm in CNN manner on FPGA...|$|R

40|$|We show two {{important}} {{findings on the}} use of deep convolutional neural networks (<b>CNN)</b> in <b>medical</b> image analysis. First, we show that CNN models that are pre-trained using computer vision databases (e. g., Imagenet) are useful in medical image applications, despite the significant differences in image appearance. Second, we show that multiview classification is possible without the pre-registration of the input images. Rather, we use the high-level features produced by the CNNs trained in each view separately. Focusing on the classification of mammograms using craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views and their respective mass and micro-calcification segmentations of the same breast, we initially train a separate CNN model for each view and each segmentation map using an Imagenet pre-trained model. Then, using the features learned from each segmentation map and unregistered views, we train a final CNN classifier that estimates the patient’s risk of developing breast cancer using the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) score. We test our methodology in two publicly available datasets (InBreast and DDSM), containing hundreds of cases, and show that it produces a volume under ROC surface of over 0. 9 and an area under ROC curve (for a 2 -class problem - benign and malignant) of over 0. 9. In general, our approach shows state-of-the-art classification results and demonstrates a new comprehensive way of addressing this challenging classification problem. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} super-resolution (SR) {{approaches}} is {{to overcome the}} hardware limitations and the clinical requirements of imaging procedures by reconstructing high-resolution images from low-resolution acquisitions using post-processing methods. SR techniques could strong impacts on structural MRI when focusing on cortical surface or fine-scale structure analysis for instance. In this paper, we study deep three-dimensional (3 D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for SR of brain MRI data. First, our work delves the relevance of several factors {{in the performance of}} the purely CNN-based technique for monomodal SR: optimization method, weight initialization, network depth, residual learning, filter size in convolution layers, number of the filters, training patch size and number of training subjects. Second, our study also highlights that one single network can efficiently handle multiple arbitrary scaling factors based on a multi-scale training approach. Third, we further extend our SR networks to multimodal SR using intermodality priors. Lastly, comparison to state-of-the-art methods in terms of transfer learning demonstrates the potential of <b>CNNs</b> for enhancing <b>medical</b> imaging...|$|R
40|$|Remarkable {{progress}} has been made in image recognition, primarily due to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets and the revival of deep CNN. CNNs enable learning data-driven, highly representative, layered hierarchical image features from sufficient training data. However, obtaining datasets as comprehensively annotated as ImageNet in the medical imaging domain remains a challenge. There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ <b>CNNs</b> to <b>medical</b> image classification: training the CNN from scratch, using off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN pre-training with supervised fine-tuning. Another effective method is transfer learning, i. e., fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained from natural image dataset to medical image tasks. In this paper, we exploit three important, but previously understudied factors of employing deep convolutional neural networks to computer-aided detection problems. We first explore and evaluate different CNN architectures. The studied models contain 5 thousand to 160 million parameters, and vary in numbers of layers. We then evaluate the influence of dataset scale and spatial image context on performance. Finally, we examine when and why transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet (via fine-tuning) can be useful. We study two specific computer-aided detection (CADe) problems, namely thoraco-abdominal lymph node (LN) detection and interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the mediastinal LN detection, with 85 % sensitivity at 3 false positive per patient, and report the first five-fold cross-validation classification results on predicting axial CT slices with ILD categories. Our extensive empirical evaluation, CNN model analysis and valuable insights can be extended to the design of high performance CAD systems for other medical imaging tasks...|$|R
40|$|Convolutional neural {{networks}} (CNNs) are deep learning network architectures that have pushed forward the state-of-the-art {{in a range}} of computer vision applications and are increasingly popular in medical image analysis. However, training of CNNs is time-consuming and challenging. In medical image analysis tasks, the majority of training examples are easy to classify and therefore contribute little to the CNN learning process. In this paper, we propose a method to improve and speed-up the <b>CNN</b> training for <b>medical</b> image analysis tasks by dynamically selecting misclassified negative samples during training. Training samples are heuristically sampled based on classification by the current status of the CNN. Weights are assigned to the training samples and informative samples {{are more likely to be}} included in the next CNN training iteration. We evaluated and compared our proposed method by training a CNN with (SeS) and without (NSeS) the selective sampling method. We focus on the detection of hemorrhages in color fundus images. A decreased training time from 170 epochs to 60 epochs with an increased performance-on par with two human experts-was achieved with areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0. 894 and 0. 972 on two data sets. The SeS CNN statistically outperformed the NSeS CNN on an independent test set...|$|R
