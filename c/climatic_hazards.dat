40|$|The study {{examined}} the spatiotemporal distribution of drought in the Maasai rangelands of Kenya. The implications of this distribution, {{in concert with the}} documented existing and/or projected social and biophysical factors, on critical rangeland resources in Maasai-pastoralism are discussed using an integrated approach. Participatory interviews with the Maasai, retrieval from archives, and acquisition from instrument measurements provided data for the study. Empirical evidence of the current study reveals that drought occurrences in this rangeland have been recurrent, widespread, cyclic, sometimes temporally clustered, and have manifested with varying intensities across spatial, temporal, and, occasionally, social scales; and they have more intensity in lower than higher agroecological areas. An estimated 86 % of drought occurrences in this rangeland, over the last three decades alone, were of major drought category. The 2000 s, with four major drought events including two extreme droughts, are an important drought period. A strong consensus exists among the Maasai regarding observed drought events. In Maasai-pastoralism, the phenomenon called drought, pastoralist drought, is simultaneously multivariate and multiscalar: its perception comprises the simultaneous manifestation of cross-scale meteorological, socioeconomic, and environmental factors and processes, and their various combinations. The inherent simultaneous multivariate and scalar nature of the pastoralist drought distinguishes it from the conventional drought types, particularly the meteorological drought that predominantly guides drought and resource management in the rangelands of Kenya. In Maasai-pastoralism, the scarcely used (33 %) meteorological drought is construed as rainfall delay/failure across spatial and/or temporal scale, and never its reduced amount. Collectively, the current findings reveal that knowledge about drought affects the way the manifestation of this <b>climatic</b> <b>hazard</b> is perceived, communicated, and characterized; hence, ceteris paribus, alongside its spatiotemporal distribution, shapes the nature of the adaptive capacity of and resource management in Maasai-pastoralism. Studies that anticipate enhancing the drought-adaptive capacity of the Maasai should account for cross-scale social and biophysical factors, their processes, and interactions; they must engage the affected inhabitants, and utilize and integrate multiple data sources and approaches. These necessities become more crucial for informing adaptation under the present spatiotemporal distribution of drought as well as in relation to the projected increase in occurrence and intensity of this <b>climatic</b> <b>hazard</b> as the climate continues to change, and as pressures from socioeconomic globalization persistently proliferate into the Maasai’s social and biophysical landscapes...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze and {{identify}} the most exposed areas to snowdrifts, in case of a blizzard phenomenon, in the plain area of Buzău County. Blizzard is the most frequently occurring <b>climatic</b> <b>hazard</b> in the study area, in the cold season, that causes the blocking of the roads and the massive snow accumulation in th built-up areas found in the open field or in negative relief forms. In order to identify areas with high potential snowdrifts, the Snow Drifts Potential Index (SDPI) was defined, calculated and localized. This was achieved in the GIS by integrating three factors, namely: the use of land, river valleys and the surfaces exposure in the study area. Finally, the results showed that the most exposed areas to the the snow-drift phenomenon are the built areas found in the river beds, and also those on slopes sheltered from contact with the Carpathian. The importance of this study lies in the fact that once established and localized the areas with high potential for snow-drifts, measures can be taken in order to combat the disastrous effects generated by blizzards in the plains of Buzău County...|$|R

40|$|Rural {{communities}} {{have long been}} using ecosystems to sustain their livelihoods, especially in times of disasters when forests act as safety nets and natural buffers. However, it is less clear how climate variability influences changes in land uses, and their implications for human well-being. We examined how forests and trees can reduce human vulnerability by affecting the three components of vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. A total of 24 focus group discussions and 256 household surveys were conducted in two smallholder-dominated rural landscapes in Indonesia, which were affected by floods, drought and disease outbreaks. Our results suggest that forests and trees are important in supporting community resilience and decreasing their vulnerabilities to climate-related stresses in different ways. The role of trees varied according {{to the type of}} ecosystem service, whether provisioning or regulating, in relation to the phase of the <b>climatic</b> <b>hazard,</b> either in the pre-disaster phase or in the post-disaster recovery phase. It is therefore important to distinguish between these elements when analyzing people's responses to climatic variability in order to fully capture the contribution of forests and trees to reducing people's vulnerability. Landscape spatial characteristics, environmental degradation and community awareness of climate variability are crucial because if their linkages are recognized, local people can actively manage natural resources to increase their resilience. Interventions related to forests and trees should take into consideration these aspects to make ecosystem services a valuable option for an integrated strategy to reduce disaster risks and climate-related vulnerabilities.

The satellite RFE 2 based SPI corresponding to the critical tasseling and silking phases (in the months of January, February, and March) were statistically regressed with drought-induced yield losses at the district level. The analysis has shown that the drought conditions in February and early March lead to most damage to maize yields in this region. The district-wise vulnerabilities to drought were up scaled to obtain a regional maize vulnerability model for southern Malawi.

40|$|This paper investigates {{what drives}} {{household}} coping strategies in rural Uganda under different <b>climatic</b> <b>hazards.</b> Rural households in sub-Saharan Africa draw on various coping strategies {{to reduce the}} impact of <b>climatic</b> <b>hazards</b> on their livelihoods.

Using empirical data from Uganda, this research contributes to this gap by (1) exploring how household coping strategy relates to household characteristics and livelihood activity and (2) how these coping strategies vary depending on the hazard. Coping strategy is found to be hazard specific for households that lack market-orientated activities, whereas those with market access rely on economic activities regardless of hazard. To maintain and improve the livelihoods and coping strategies of those most vulnerable to climatic variability and change, policies that advocate diversification away from a sole reliance on customary activities need to recognize the level and opportunity for market-based activities. These interventions must account for different sensitivities to different hazards as well as the homogeneity of the community in order to effectively support rural communities to cope with climate variability...|$|E

40|$|Sustainability of {{livestock}} farming systems (LFS) based on grassland {{depends on their}} abilities to buffer environmental variations while maintaining targeted production project. These abilities come from the regulating properties of LFS. On one side, regulations can arise from adaptive grazing management {{in order to take}} advantage of resource diversity under <b>climatic</b> <b>hazard</b> (Andrieu et al., 2007). On the other side, regulations can also arise from female adaptive abilities driven by farmer practices. At the herd level, variable female responses generate a diversity of lifetime performances. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the contribution of lifetime performance diversity to the sustainability of LFS based on grassland. We relied on the example of dairy goat herd. Total milk production in year 1 was similar for both cases (Case 1 : 120 601 kg; Case 2 : 119 016 kg). The decline in fertility led to a decrease of production in both cases. However, in case 1 this decline was around 17 % of herd production in year 1 and around 8 % in case 2. In case 2, the perturbation due to low fertility was buffered at herd level due to an increase in the number of females maintained in extended lactation. These females contributed to 14 % and 24 % of overall production in years 1 and 2 respectively. Both management cases illustrate that herd can have regulating properties arising from the diversity of female lifetime performances. This aspect can be of great interest for grassland systems where feed supply is highly variable and female regulating properties are strongly solicited...|$|R
40|$|On 11 August 1831, St Vincent {{was struck}} by the Great Caribbean Hurricane. Ninety-two out of 96 sugar estates on the island {{experienced}} damage to buildings and crops. Destruction varied, however, according to location and the type of structure at risk. Worst affected were the northerly regions of St David and Charlotte's parishes, while slave villages suffered more than mill works or great houses. As a result of the storm the colony's exports fell by nearly 50 per cent, reflecting disruption to the infrastructure supporting overseas trade as well as a sugar crop shortfall of more than 25 per cent. In contrast to the hazard's large impact on plantation agriculture, relatively few casualties occurred. St Vincent also suffered less acutely than Barbados, a similar sized island, equally dependent on sugar and slavery. A plausible explanation for the hurricane's differential impact between the two colonies lies in localised vulnerability of place. While the enslaved population did not take advantage of the disaster to mount a challenge to white authority, shortages of provisions and timber strained relations on some estates. St Vincent's plantation economy, however, recovered relatively quickly, demonstrating considerable disaster resilience. Although slaves and the free black and mixed-race population received little direct government support, grant-in-aid was allocated to agents primarily responsible for coordinating supplies of food, clothing and shelter. The speed of recovery questions whether natural disasters weakened planter resistance to emancipation across the British West Indies.

The purpose of this research is to assess South Dakota ranchers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of a natural hazard that directly affects their livelihood and to identify what operational adjustments have been made in response to drought in the area since 1870. Content analysis of data from interviews with ranchers provides a number of attribute categories for description of drought. A matrix of similarity coefficients derived from the categories is analyzed to isolate associations of drought descriptors used to formulate a more general definition applicable to semi-arid environments. The adjustments made by South Dakota ranchers prior to 1930 to mitigate drought are compared with contemporary perceptions concerning drought and subsequent adjustments to assess the persistence of certain ranching practices. Results indicate that ranchers recognize drought as a major <b>climatic</b> <b>hazard</b> that they expect to occur on an unpredictable basis.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} humans and their environment {{in the context of}} climate change in coastal Cambodia. Specifically, this thesis focuses on household energy consumption behavior, climate change adaptation and subjective human health impacts. A cross-sectional survey of 1823 individuals in four coastal provinces in Cambodia was conducted. A series of quantitative analyses, including complementary log-log regression, ordered logistic regression and logistic regression analysis, were employed to analyze the data. The results showed that both past experience of extreme climatic events and awareness of climate change had a positive relationship with household energy reduction behavior. Females and rural residents were less likely to report reduction in household energy. Perceived self-efficacy, education and duration of residence had positive relationships with both anticipatory and reactive adaptation to climate change although to varying degrees. Perceived socio-ecological impact of climate change and barriers to protect against the impact of climate change had negative associations with self-rated health. Furthermore, older individuals, females and higher income households had negative associations with self-reported health. However, individuals who had attained higher formal education and those who were employed reported better health status. This study makes contributions to theory, methodology and more importantly policy issues around climate change in coastal Cambodia. Using theoretical constructs from the Social Cognitive Theory, the findings show that direct personal agency (first-hand experiences) of <b>climatic</b> <b>hazard</b> events {{plays a key role in}} behavior response to climate change through a reduction in household energy consumption. Perceived self-efficacy also plays an important role in both anticipatory and reactive adaptation to climate change. The overall interaction between personal and social-environment in this context influences self-rated health. The utilization of a plurality of statistical techniques in this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the interaction of coastal populations and their environment in Cambodia under a changing climate. Finally, the findings of this study may serve as a potential road map for policy makers on household energy reduction, climate change adaptation and coastal community health in Cambodia...|$|R

The delineation between the two phenomena, respectively snow transport at heights as compared to the one on the ground is often subjective or difficult to assess (being determined visually by the observatories at the meteorological stations.) The topography of the place, the moment of day when the phenomenon is produced, the luminosity, the visibility landmarks, etc. can often times lead to the incorrect assessment of the phenomenon. The only parameter measured exactly (among the meteorological parameters that define the phenomenon) is the wind (parameter that is determined automatically by the sensors in the meteorological stations where they exist), aspect that might be a delineating factor when the occurrence of the phenomenon is estimated. The climatological analysis of the data derived from 19 meteorological stations located in the South-East of Romania, throughout a period of over 50 years (1961 - 2012) revealed the existence of the phenomenon of blizzard (transported on ground or at height), associated/not-associated to the phenomenon of snow, with a snow layer/without and at different intensities of the wind. Being a natural phenomenon with <b>climatic</b> <b>hazard</b> and negative impact on the environment and the human society, the correct delineation of the two phenomena might highlight the territories with increased vulnerability to its occurrence. Starting from those presented above, the hereby paper aims to make a detailed climatological analysis regarding the snow transport on ground and at height and their delineation based on the data given by the 19 meteorological stations placed in the South-East of Romania (1961 - 2012) ...|$|R
