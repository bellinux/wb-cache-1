25|$|By some analysts, {{the process}} has been {{declared}} ineffective. The stalling of the Middle East Peace Process is having an impact on the Barcelona Process and is hindering progress especially in the first basket. The economic basket can be considered a success, and there have been more projects for the exchange on a cultural level and between the peoples in the riparian states. Other criticism is mainly based on the predominant role the European Union is playing. Normally it is the EU that is assessing the state of affairs, which leads to the impression that the North is dictating the South what to do. The question of an enhanced <b>co-ownership</b> of {{the process has}} repeatedly been brought up over the last years.|$|E

Paolo Castellini, also out on loan the previous year, was again farmed out, this time to relegated side Sampdoria. Meanwhile, right-sided Brazilian Ângelo left the club after the expiry of his contract for Serie A rivals Siena.

25|$|<b>Co-ownership</b> co-ops are {{generally}} older apartment buildings, incorporated before the Ontario Condominium Act, 1973 came into existence, where shareholders each own one voting {{share in the}} corporation that owns the building and have a registered right to occupy individual units as described on their share certificate. Most {{of these types of}} co-ops date from the thirties, forties and fifties and are located in the City of Toronto. They are similar to condominiums, in that units may be bought and sold by private sale or on the open market. Until relatively recently, these units tended to be bought by older people with home equity who could buy the unit outright, as it was difficult to get a mortgage against these units. However, a number of Ontario credit unions are now offering limited financing, provided that that individual co-op corporations meet their fiscal standards, making these units affordable housing options for younger buyers. Incoming owners must be approved by the building's Board of Directors, and agree to abide by building by-laws and Occupancy Agreements.|$|E

Moreover, in 2010 the result was boosted by acquiring the asset from subsidiary (related to AC Fiorentina) and the re-valuation of its value in separate balance sheet. If deducting that income (€14,737,855), 2010 financial year was net loss 24,342,208 and 2011 result was worse with €8,131,876 only in separate balance sheet. In 2012, the club benefited from the sales of Matija Nastasić and Valon Behrami, followed by Stevan Jovetić and Adem Ljajić in 2013.

2500|$|Building on {{the successes}} of the Jive label, Zomba began {{expanding}} its reach by purchasing and creating new labels, and by creating new divisions that helped expose more people to Zomba artists and services. [...] In 1988, Andrew Lauder formed the UK-based Silvertone Records under the Zomba Group. [...] While Jive focused on hip hop, Silvertone focused on more rock-oriented music. [...] The label's roster was initially bolstered by The Stone Roses, but quickly expanded to include blues, acoustic, and roots music.
