50|$|Ribosomes, the organelles that {{catalyze}} protein synthesis, {{consist of}} a small 40S subunit and a large 60S subunit. Together these subunits are composed of 4 RNA species and approximately 80 structurally distinct proteins. This gene encodes a ribosomal protein that is {{a component of the}} 60S subunit. The protein belongs to the L30P family of ribosomal proteins. It contains an N-terminal basic region-leucine zipper (BZIP)-like domain and the RNP consensus submotif RNP2. In vitro the BZIP-like domain mediates homodimerization and stable binding to DNA and RNA, with a preference for 28S rRNA and mRNA. The protein can inhibit <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> of mRNAs, suggesting that it plays a regulatory role in the translation apparatus. It is located in the cytoplasm. The protein {{has been shown to be}} an autoantigen in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. As is typical for genes encoding ribosomal proteins, there are multiple processed pseudogenes of this gene dispersed through the genome.|$|E
40|$|Meiotic {{maturation}} stimulates {{a change}} in the translation of stored mRNAs: mRNAs encoding proteins needed for growth of oocytes are translated before meiotic maturation, whereas those encoding proteins required for cleavage are translated after meiotic maturation. Studies of translational regulation during meiotic maturation have been limited by the lack of translationally active cell-free supernatants. Starfish oocytes are ideal for preparing <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> systems because experimental application of the hormone 1 -methyladenine induces their maturation, synchronizing meiosis. We have prepared such systems from both immature and mature oocytes of starfish. Changes in protein synthesis rates and the specificity of proteins synthesized in these <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> supernatants mimic those seen in vivo. Supernatants both from immature and mature oocytes have a high capacity to initiate new translation because 90 % of the proteins made are newly initiated from mRNAs. Cell-free supernatants from mature oocytes have a much higher rate of initiation of translation than those from immature oocytes and use the 43 S preinitiation complexes more efficiently in initiation of translation. Similarly, we have shown that mRNAs and initiation factors are rate limiting in <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> systems prepared from immature oocytes. In addition, <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> systems prepared from immature oocytes are only slightly, if at all, inhibitory to <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> systems from mature oocytes. Thus, soluble inhibitors, if they exist, are rapidly converted by cell-free supernatants from mature oocytes. The similarities between translation in our starfish <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> systems and in intact oocytes suggests that the <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> systems will be useful tools for further studies of maturation events and translational control during meiosis...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{metallothionein}} (MT) {{was assessed}} in the copper-loading disease prevalent in Bedlington terriers. Fractionation of tissue supernatants over Sephadex G- 75 showed {{that most of}} the additional cytosolic copper present in liver tissue of these dogs was bound to MT, and that substantially more MT-bound copper could be solubilized by detergent plus mercaptoethanol. Zinc contents were only slightly raised, although most of the extra zinc was associated with a 4000 -Mr ligand. Ion-exchange chromatography revealed two isoproteins, MT 1 and MT 2, in all the dog liver samples examined. In Bedlington terrier liver, copper associated with both isoproteins was increased, although the increase for MT 2 was greater than for MT 1. The content of MT protein was also raised, although <b>cell-free</b> <b>translations</b> and RNA blots of total liver RNA showed that this increase was not associated with a rise in MT mRNA.

40|$|The {{invariant}} {{gamma chain}} is transitorily associated with class II histocompatibility antigens during intracellular transport. We have isolated and sequenced a cDNA clone {{corresponding to the}} human gamma chain. mRNA hybridizing to the cDNA clone translated into a 33, 000 -dalton chain that associated specifically with class II antigen alpha and beta chains. The gamma chain consists of 216 amino acids. The two N-linked carbohydrates are attached to asparagines 114 and 120. A continuous stretch of hydrophobic and neutral amino acids occurs in positions 31 - 56 from the NH 2 terminus. This region seems to constitute the transmembrane portion of the polypeptide chain. The positions of the carbohydrate moieties and the putative transmembrane segment indicate that the NH 2 terminus of the gamma chain resides on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. <b>Cell-free</b> <b>translations</b> in conjunction with radiochemical amino acid sequence analyses suggest that the gamma chain lacks an NH 2 -terminal signal sequence...|$|R

The effect of simian virus 40 (SV 40) large T antigen (T-ag) was examined on the translation of the 14 -kDa MBP mRNA in reticulocyte lysates and on MBP expression after transfection into cells that express SV 40 T-ag. SV 40 T-ag did not inhibit translation of 14 -kDa MBP cRNAs in <b>cell-free</b> <b>translations</b> even at 30 µ M (∼ 600 µg/ml) T-ag. Permanent transfection of COS- 1 cells (which endogenously express SV 40 T-ag) with the 14 -kDa MBP cDNA resulted in {{the expression of the}} 14 -kDa MBP as determined by western blot analysis. Permanent transfection of N 20. 1 cells, an oligodendrocyte line immortalized with a temperature-sensitive SV 40 T-ag, with the 14 -kDa MBP cDNA construct also resulted in the expression of the 14 -kDa MBP under conditions in which the cells expressed functional SV 40 T-ag. These results indicate that SV 40 T-ag does not prevent expression of the MBP gene at the translational level and that in those immortalized oligodendrocyte lines that express MBP mRNA, but not MBP protein, some factor other than the SV 40 large T-ag is responsible for the posttranscriptional regulation...|$|R
40|$|We {{characterized}} seven temperature-sensitive capsid cleavage (cleavage-defective) mutants of encephalomyocarditis virus. Our experimental {{approach was}} to monitor in vitro proteolysis reactions of either wild-type or cleavage-defective mutant capsid precursors mixed with <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> products (containing the viral protease) of either wild-type or mutant viral RNA. The <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> reactions and in vitro proteolysis reactions were done at 38 degrees C, because at this temperature cleavage of the capsid precursors was restricted in reactions containing cleavage-defective mutant viral RNA as the message, relative to those reactions containing wild-type viral RNA as the message. Wild-type or cleavage-defective mutant capsid precursors were prepared by adding cycloheximide to <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> reactions primed with wild-type or mutant viral RNA, respectively, 12 min after {{the initiation of}} translation. In vitro proteolysis of wild-type capsid precursors with <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> products of either wild-type or cleavage-defective mutant viral RNA led to similar products at 38 degrees C, indicating that the cleavage-defective mutant viral protease was not temperature sensitive. As a corollary to this, at 38 degrees C cleavage-defective mutant capsid precursors were not cleaved as completely as were wild-type capsid precursors by products of <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> of wild-type viral RNA.

40|$|We {{have used}} proteinase K as a probe to detect cytoplasmically and luminally exposed {{segments}} of nascent polypeptides undergoing transport across mammalian microsomal membranes. A series of translocation intermediates consisting of discrete-sized nascent chains was prepared by including microsomal membranes in <b>cell-free</b> <b>translations</b> of mRNAs lacking termination codons. The truncated mRNAs {{were derived from}} preprolactin and the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus and encoded nascent chains ranging between 64 and 200 amino acid residues long. Partially translocated nascent chains of 100 amino acid residues or less were insensitive to protease digestion from the external surface of the membrane while longer nascent chains were susceptible to digestion by externally added protease. We conclude that the increased protease sensitivity of larger nascent chains {{is due to the}} exposure of a segment of the nascent polypeptide on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. In contrast, low molecular weight nascent chains were remarkably resistant to protease digestion even after detergent solubilization of the membrane. The protease resistant behaviour of detergent solubilized nascent chains could be abolished by release of the polypeptide from the ribosome or by the addition of protein denaturants. We propose that the protease resistance of partially translocated nascent chains can be ascribed to components of the translocation apparatus that remain bound to the nascent chain after detergent solubilization of the membrane...|$|R

40|$|Extracts from unfertilized {{sea urchin}} eggs contain an {{inhibitor}} of translation that inhibits protein synthesis in <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> systems from sea urchin embryos or rabbit reticulocytes.

The accumulated data suggest that the ability of eIF- 4 F to recycle may be compromised. The addition of eIF- 4 F to <b>cell-free</b> <b>translation</b> systems from unfertilized sea urchin eggs also stimulates protein synthesis.

40|$|In {{the early}} sea urchin embryo, newly {{synthesized}} cytoplasmic histone mRNA is found both on polysomes {{and free of}} ribosomes as nonpolysomal messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (free RNPs). The distribution of newly synthesized histone mRNAs between translating and nontranslating compartments is nonrandom and dependent on the developmental stage. Gel electrophoresis and autoradiography of polysomal and free RNP RNA from embryos at various stages show that (i) the fraction of total newly synthesized histone mRNA that is in polysomes {{is greater than the}} fraction of total newly synthesized poly(A) +mRNA that is in polysomes, at all stages examined, and (ii) among the five histone mRNAs. H 1 mRNA and H 4 mRNA are relatively more enriched in the free RNPs than are the mRNAs for H 2 A, H 2 B, and H 3. These data suggest that histone mRNA, as a class, is more efficiently utilized as a template than the average mRNA and, of the cytoplasmic histone mRNAs, the mRNAs for histones H 2 A, H 2 B, and possibly H 3 are selected more frequently for translation than those for H 1 and H 4. <b>Cell-free</b> <b>translations</b> of polysomal and free RNP RNAs yield different ratios of in vitro histone products, consistent with the RNA distribution data.

In addition, Stage III embryos develop into mature embryos in culture medium containing ABA. In the absence of ABA, Stage III embryos precociously germinate and yield mature wheat plants indistinguishable from those produced by Stage V embryos. Germination is characterized by synthesis {{of a number of}} specific proteins, including the small subunit of ribulose- 1, 5 - bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (ssRUBISCO). De novo svnthesis of ssRUBISCO is first detected two days after imbibition. Dark-grown seedlings have 40 % of the amount of ssRUBISCO present in light-grown seedlings at this time. Synthesis and accumulation of ssRUBISCO increases in light-grown seedlings by three days, while decreasing in seedlings deprived of :Light. Synthesis and accumulation of ssRUBISCO were monitored by in vivo protein labelling and immunologically using Western blotting. Neither synthesis nor accumulation of this protein is detected when germination is repressed by ABA. <b>Cell-free</b> <b>translations</b> of extant mRNA of Stage V embryos and that of germinating seedlings show a dramatic change in translatable RNA upon imbibition. ABA does not prevent this change in translatable RNA. Both in vivo and in vitro protein synthesis reveal few differences between +ABA- and -ABA-seedlings during early germination. This indicates that ABA is not a general inhibitor of transcript formation, but rather affects specific gene expression. Nick-translated cDNA homologous to wheat ssRUBISCO mRNA is used to determine levels of ssRUBISCO mRNA in germinating seedlings. This message is newly transcribed during the first day of germination. As germination progresses, an increasing percentage of the poly A+ population is found as ssRUBISCO mRNA.

The protein products are therefore directly immobilized onto solid surfaces and furthermore were discovered to adopt a more native state with proper protein folding and superior biological activity compared with conventional liquid-phase approaches.

On {{the basis of these}} findings, we have devised a chip-based approach for the rapid screening of blockers against ion channels. The technique is demonstrated here with the viral potassium channel, Kcv...|$|R
