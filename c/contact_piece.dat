Three-dimensional (3 -D) finite element method (FEM) is employed to compute the electro-dynamic repulsion forces, including the Holm force and Lorentz force, which are acting on the static and movable contacts.

40|$|Abstract. Vibration or {{bouncing}} {{of electrical}} contacts at closure {{is a reason}} of failure occurring in relays, contactors, circuit breakers and other electrical equipment due to arc erosion and welding. Experimentally observed bouncing of electrical contacts in vacuum circuit breakers cannot be satisfactorily explained by elastic restitution force or electrodynamic repulsion. This paper attempts to estimate the influence of metallic vapour pressure generated by arc in the contact gap on contact motion. The mathematical model describing these phenomena includes a non-linear differential motion equation for a movable <b>contact</b> <b>piece,</b> heat equations for anode and cathode (Axisymmetric Stefan’s problem with two free boundaries for melting and evaporation), a differential equation for the arc column, and non-linear algebraic equations for near-electrode regions. The special method of majorant functions is applied for the solution of this problem. It is found theoretically and confirmed experimentally that the vapour force at contact bouncing is sometimes comparable and may be greater than the contact spring force even in vacuum. Some aspects of resonance phenomena, when the frequency of mechanical oscillations {{is close to the}} frequency of alternative current are also discussed...|$|E

30|$|The {{principle}} of EDM and EDM drilling is same except that during drilling process the electrode rotates and removes the burrs effectively with fluid pressure {{supplied by the}} channels in the electrode. Drilling micro-holes with conventional methods is often extremely difficult if not impossible. After drilling micro-holes, the geometrical accuracy was distorted and also the surface quality {{was not so much}} effective. EDM drilling is often the only practical method for producing such holes. As conventional drills enter or exit, they can break if torque is not carefully controlled. Small broken drills are often difficult to remove from the workpiece, and time is wasted replacing broken drills and parts may have to be scrapped. With EDM drilling, torque does not exist since the electrode never <b>contacts</b> the <b>piece</b> (Simon and Grama 2011). Song et al.

40|$|Formation of {{multiple}} polymorphs during two-dimensional (2 D) crystallization of organic molecules {{is more of}} a routine occurrence than rarity. Although such diverse crystalline structures provide exciting possibilities for studying crystal engineering in 2 D, predicting the occurrence of polymorphs for a given building block is often non-trivial. Moreover, there is scarcity of methods that can experimentally verify the presence of such crystalline polymorphs in a straightforward fashion. Here we demonstrate a relatively simple experimental approach for screening of 2 D polymorphs formed at the solution–solid interface. The strategy involves use of solution flow produced by <b>contacting</b> a <b>piece</b> of tissue paper to the sample to generate a lateral density gradient along the substrate surface. In situ generation of such gradient allows rapid discovery and nanoscale separation {{of multiple}} 2 D polymorphs in a single experiment.
