40|$|This paper {{combines}} {{the idea that}} securities should be information insensitive {{in order to be}} liquid, with the idea that an infrastructure which performs clearing of trades, and offers additional services to the counterparties, facilitates securities to be liquid. In a recent paper, Gorton et al. [3] argue that securities that serve as a transaction medium should be the least information-sensitive, and derive sufficient conditions for such security to be debt. Also, a few recent papers 1 emphasize the role of a Central Counterparty (CCP) in internalizing externalities that stem from the opacity of over-the-counter (OTC) transactions and the role of a CCP in providing the participants with insurance and cost effective clearing services. This paper focuses on the latter role: it develops a framework very similar to Gorton et al. [3], modified to analyze some of the functions that a CCP performs. It shows that for any type of security, regardless of whether it is debt or equity, <b>clearing</b> <b>transactions</b> through a CCP reduces the extent to which securities are information-sensitive. Two functions of a CCP are key: multilateral netting and the provision of insurance through a default fund. B...|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the role of the central banks in {{advanced}} market economies and the theoretical possibility of abolishing these institutions. Central banks have monopolies in some areas, especially regarding monetary policy. In many countries, central banks also have monopolies in other areas, for example in the payment and <b>clearing</b> <b>transactions</b> for banks and the state. In the context of the financial crises, there have been calls for the abolition of central banks and the restoration of money fully-backed by gold and issued by different subjects. The main reasoning behind these requests is connected with the accusation that central banks have been the basic culprits in the current crisis, because of their monopoly of the issuing money. This argument fails to recognize that central banks do not have a monopoly in issuing money as the dominant share of the money creation is attached with the process of multiplication of demand deposits by commercial banks. Restoration of the money backed by gold is furthermore completely unrealistic. The article discusses the shortage of gold stock as one of many reasons why gold is not suitable for monetary purposes. multiplication, monopoly, money issuance, monetary policy, gold, central bank, banking regulation and supervision...|$|E
40|$|Prepaid cards, cash cards, {{electronic}} purses, {{smart cards}} these {{are but a}} few of the elements inthe revolution now taking place in monetary systems around the world. At that movement's heart is the emergence of a new value transfer system where alternative monies are offered toconsumers through the miracle of electronics. There are many stories in the business press about the general enthusiasm for these new forms of money. According to the hyperbole from marketing reps from this side of the financial community, currency and demand deposits soon will be endangered species. Consumer acceptance is alleged to be high, and cost efficiency associated with the new technology is expected to be substantial. Yet, as Wenninger and Laster (1995) suggest, "to succeed, an electronic purse system will need to offer enough features of value to its three constituencies consumers, merchants, and issuers to induce them to bear the cost. " Most arguments in favorof these media of exchange can be viewed as a reaction to the rising costs associated with current check clearing and on-line credit systems. Data are scare. However, the cost advantages to the banking system of a movement from paper check to debit cards is alleged to be in the range of 50 %. Off-line pre-paid cards are expected to reduce the cost of <b>clearing</b> <b>transactions,</b> handling cash and reducing fraud for merchants. To read the press, the consumer is equally enthusiastic. However, the economic rationale for this consumer enthusiasm is a bit unclear. Each application of the emerging electronic technology has been different in important ways. The universal receptivity to alternative monies may be more a good marketing ploy than good economics. To understand consumer reaction requires a careful analysis of the desirability of any one of these alternative technologies in terms of its impact on consumer cash management costs through changes in transaction patterns, average money holdings, and total transaction costs. The authors attempt this analysis by investigating the effect of variations in the number and type of monies on consumer transactions demand using a Baumol-Tobin type model of moneydemand. They investigate the behavior of a representative consumer facedwith a choice ofmonies with which to transact, and ask how variations in the characteristics of these monies will affect the consumer choice of transaction vehicle, transactions frequency, and average balance in various media. The results are surprising. Variations in the cost of transfer, interest rates, and the acceptabilityof alternative media have surprising effects on consumer choice. In general, the cost of using amedium of exchange determines whether it will be used and for which goods it will be traded. The choice of medium of exchange, then, has a direct effect on both the average holdings ofdifferent types of money and their transition frequencies. It suggests that efforts by banks to alter the costs of using a particular form of money may cause consumers to change their exchange behavior, shifting it sometimes rather dramatically. The authors demonstrate the impact of these results with an example of a stored value card, and its competitive position vis-a-vis the two most common media of exchange. This transfermedium offers some of the features of demand deposits such as ease of transfer and generalacceptability. At the same time, it avoids the fixed costs of a checking account while offering noreturn on average balances. The authors have observed that households tend to use the high-interest medium of exchange to buy the good that constitutes the larger share of its income. Given the relative rates of return on stored value cards and checking account balances, the former is unlikely to dislodge the use of checks for purchases. On the other hand, the stored value card represents a credible threat for cash transactions. Here, rates of return are both zero, although it can be argued that cash may have a negative return due to theft. Given their new ease of use, smart cards could also be competitive from a transfer fee perspective. In fact, given the lower cost of transfer into the card, it may dominate cash in the near future. While the foregoing results apply to the individual household, aggregate results often are moredifficult to prove. For example, an increase in the cost of obtaining a medium of exchange,reduces the number of households using the exchange, but raises average balances for thosehouseholds that continue to use it. Therefore, efforts by banks to lower the costs of using aparticular form of medium of exchange may well reduce the average holding of that medium. Also, interest rates generally have ambiguous effects on money holdings. Determining whetheran increase in a particular interest rate will raise or lower holdings of a particular form of money requires a case by case analysis, and the conclusions can change from one day to the next with changes in other parameters of concern to the household. The authors conclude that affecting monetary behavior is no simple matter. As providers ofdifferent monies move from experimentation to implementation, these results offer a warning. The choice of money or monies to be used for transactions purposes is a complex decision. Itdoes not lend itself to simple extrapolation from consumer surveys, and, in fact, may result insubstantially different outcomes than had been presumed. ...|$|E

40|$|In a Black Scholes {{world there}} exists a dynamic trading {{strategy}} that can replicate the payoff of an option. The technique of Portfolio Insurance is an application of this principle. This paper examines {{the ability of a}} futures based trading strategy to replicate the returns of a protective put option, thereby creating perfect portfolio insurance. The performance of these insured portfolios is simulated over a period from April 1984 to march 1989. Results indicate that portfolio insurance is effective at eliminating downside risk when the market falls significantly albeit at a level below the guaranteed minimum return. For smaller downward movements the results are not as encouraging. While the dynamic strategy may be able to "meet-the-floor" in cost adjusted terms, in most instances the terminal value of the insured portfolio is actually lower than the value of the market portfolio. Reducing the minimum required rate of return increases the likelihood of portfolio insurance being able to acieve its objective. Increasing the volatility estimate above the historical level - which is a way of incorporating market imperfections like transaction costs and futures mispricing into the model - resulted in better performance when the market fell but exacted a higher opportunity costs when prices were rising. Evidence suggests that market initiated rebalance strategies result in better performance although there is a <b>clear</b> <b>transaction</b> cost - replication error trade-off. ...|$|R
40|$|The main {{contribution}} of the diploma thesis is to give a comprehensive picture of the switch from LIBOR to OIS discounting. Prior to the global financial crisis, LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) represented an approximation of the risk-free rate in the valuation of interest rate derivatives. The collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 resulted in sharp widening of the LIBOR-OIS spread, {{an indicator of the}} interbank market stress. Many derivative practitioners have become concerned about the choice of an appropriate risk-free rate. Traditional valuation approaches using LIBOR discounting have been reviewed. Meanwhile, the OIS (Overnight Indexed Swap) rate has become a better proxy for the risk-free rate, at least for collateralized or centrally <b>cleared</b> <b>transactions.</b> Firstly, the research aims to discover the divergences between LIBOR rates, popular pre-crisis proxies for the riskfree rate, and OIS rates, their post-crisis alternatives. Secondly, it covers the interbank lending market, and analyzes individual LIBOR-OIS spreads for the USD, EUR, GBP and CZK currency. Thirdly, it explores the transition to OIS discounting in connection with an influence on a wide spectrum of interest rate derivatives. Therefore, any potential effects are demonstrated on numerical valuation examples of interest rate swaps in the USD, EUR, and GBP currency. Finally, the diploma thesis addresses a topic of collateral management and clarifies different approaches using LIBOR or OIS rates for collateralized or non-collateralized transactions...|$|R
