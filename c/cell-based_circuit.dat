40|$|Soft-Max (SM) {{operation}} in vector signal processing usually serves to remap an input distribution within a predetermined range; by a scalar (gain) parameter one can adjust {{the sharpness of}} the overall process. Thus, to exhibit practical interest, design approaches to SM circuitry should be consistent and, at the same time, allow dynamic gain control. Therefore, a preliminary analysis applies a power-series expansion to Soft-Max processing and derives both an analytical upper bound to the resulting approximation error, and a convenient mathematical approach to gain control. Theoretical achievements drive the subsequent current-mode circuit design, which yields a modular architecture that enhances overall parallelism. For simplicity, a digital mechanism supports the dynamic gain control in Soft-Max processing, but analogue solutions are also feasible. Simulation results in both static and dynamic tests confirmed the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed design method.

40|$|A fault f j {{is said to}} {{dominate}} another fault f i if all tests for fi detect fj. When two faults dominate each other, they are called equivalent. Dominance and equivalence relations among faults around a Boolean gate are called " and are used for fault collapsing in large circuits. Some fault equivalences, that cannot {{be determined by the}} structural analysis, can be found by " equivalence relations. This paper gives a dominance" relation, which has not been described in the literature. Since the functional analysis is computationally expensive, it can only be applied to small circuits such as standard cells. A graph-theoretic hierarchical fault collapsing method from the recent literature can then collapse faults in any large <b>cell-based</b> <b>circuit.</b> It is found that the size of the dominance collapsed set for an exclusive-OR cell reduces to just four faults when functional dominance isconsidered. With the traditional method of structural collapsing this set contains 13 faults. When the exclusive-OR cell is used to build an 8 -bit adder circuit, the size of the dominance collapsed set reduces to 112 faults from a total of 466 faults. Traditional structural dominance collapsing would have given a set of 226 faults. Smaller fault set can lead to more compact tests. Collapsing for the cell-based design of benchmark circuit, c 499, reduces a set of 2, 710 faults to just 586 faults. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} control pre-mRNA {{splicing}} with small molecules could facilitate the development of therapeutics or <b>cell-based</b> <b>circuits</b> that control gene function. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM 1) {{is caused by the}} dysregulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing due to sequestration of muscleblind-like 1 protein (MBNL 1) by expanded, non-coding r(CUG) repeats (r(CUG) exp). Here we report two small molecules that induce or ameliorate alternative splicing dysregulation. The thiophene-containing small molecule (1) inhibits the interaction of MBNL 1 with its natural pre-mRNA substrates. Compound (2), a substituted naphthyridine, binds r(CUG) exp and displaces MBNL 1. Structural models show that 1 binds MBNL 1 in the Zn-finger domain and that 2 interacts with UU loops in r(CUG) exp. This study provides a structural framework for small molecules that target MBNL 1 by mimicking r(CUG) exp and shows that targeting MBNL 1 causes dysregulation of alternative splicing, suggesting that MBNL 1 is thus not a suitable therapeutic target for the treatment of DM 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{design of}} high performance, high precision, {{real-time}} {{digital signal processing}} (DSP) systems, such as those associated with wavelet signal processing, is a challenging problem. This paper reports on the innovative use of the residue number system (RNS) for implementing high-end wavelet filter banks. The disclosed system uses an enhanced index-transformation defined over Galois fields to efficiently support different wavelet filter instantiations without adding any extra cost or additional look-up tables (LUT). A selection of a small wordwidth modulus set are the keys for attaining low-complexity and high-throughput. An exhaustive comparison against existing two’s complement (2 C) designs for different custom IC technologies was carried out. Results reveal a performance improvement of up to 100 % for high-precision RNS-based systems. These structures demonstrated to be well suited for field programmable logic (FPL) assimilation {{as well as for}} CBIC (<b>cell-based</b> integrated <b>circuit)</b> technologies...|$|R

40|$|As CMOS {{processes}} {{scale and}} digital gates become faster, it is practical to implement precisely-timed digital circuits switching in the GHz range. As a result, traditionally analog circuits have moved towards mostly-digital designs, utilizing accurate time control and digital signal processing. Recently published all-digital architectures have shown several advantages over conventional analog circuits {{in terms of}} area, scalability, testability, and programmability. This thesis proposes a cell-based design methodology for synthesizable RF/analog circuits, where all functional blocks are not only implemented in all-digital architectures, {{but they are also}} described in a hardware description language, synthesized from commercial standard cell libraries, and automatically placed and routed using design tools. This cell-based design procedure significantly shortens the design time, and enhances portability of the circuits for various applications and different design nodes. A cell-based digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) is proposed as a core block for synthesizable circuits. The DCO consists of tri-state buffers from standard cell libraries, and the frequency of the DCO is digitally controlled by turning on/off the buffers. Instead of custom layout, the buffers in the DCO are automatically placed and routed (P&R), and systematic mismatch from automatic P&R is modeled and utilized to characterize the DCO in the design phase. Calibration schemes utilizing systematic mismatch are also proposed to achieve higher DCO resolution. This thesis presents an ultra-wideband (UWB) transmitter, a time-to-digital converter (TDC), and a PLL in 65 nm CMOS technologies as prototypes of <b>cell-based</b> <b>circuits.</b> The UWB transmitters embed the proposed DCO to control the center frequency and width of output pulses in the 3. 1 GHz- 5. 0 GHz UWB band, and the measured active energy efficiency of the transmitter ranges from 12 pJ/pulse to 19 pJ/pulse. The TDC adopts a cyclic Vernier structure, where two DCOs are oscillating with slightly different periods. The resolution of the TDC is the difference between two periods, which is measured as low as 8 ps. The prototype PLL adopts the TDC and the DCO, and shows 3. 2 psrms of period jitter at 2. 5 GHz output frequency, which is comparable to state-of-the-art full-custom ADPLLs...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} GOLDENGATE - a bridging fault simulator for <b>cell-based</b> digital VLSI <b>circuits</b> {{with the following}} features: 1. It targets both combinational and sequential circuits. 2. It simulates general (routing, adjacency, and intra-cell) realistic bridging faults efficiently through a table-based scheme. The pre-computed table contains accurate cell output voltage and I DDQ values obtained through electrical-level simulations. 3. It simulates both feedback and nonfeedback bridging faults (BFs) efficiently through a cycling event-driven technique. 4. It allows mixed voltage and I DDQ simulation to support a fully hybrid test scheme where mixed logic and I DDQ sensings are allowed. The experimental results show that GOLDENGATE is both accurate and fast. 1 Introduction Due to the high integration density of VLSI circuits, bridging faults (a physical defect that form a faulty resistive short between two conducting nets in the layout), have {{become one of the}} most frequently [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Among {{the various}} CMOS logic families, PTL has been {{recognized}} as one of the potential alternatives to static CMOS for the synthesis of high performance and low power circuits. Moreover, as BDDs can be readily mapped to PTL circuits, use of BDDs has been synonymous with the synthesis of PTL circuits. Most of the reported works on PTL synthesis are based on the Reduced Ordered BDDs (ROBDDs). We have developed a novel heuristic-based technique for obtaining Reduced Unordered BDDs (RUBDDs), which leads to circuits of smaller size having lesser delay and smaller power consumption compared to the existing results. We propose the technology mapping using the popular LEAP-like cells, such that the PTL circuit synthesis flow has the same flavor as that of the standard <b>cell-based</b> static CMOS <b>circuit</b> synthesis. We have also developed models for the estimation of delay and power consumption of the synthesized PTL circuits and compared those with the static CMOS and other existing PTL-based circuit realizations. ...|$|R
40|$|Treatment of {{neurodegenerative}} disease is {{entering a new}} era where direct intracerebral delivery of therapeutic factors aims to restore normality to dysfunctional <b>circuits.</b> <b>Cell-based</b> therapeutic approaches, where virally manipulated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) overexpressing glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) are utilized as vehicles to deliver neurotrophic support to the Parkinsonian brain, have shown promising preclinical results at preserving dopaminergic neuron integrity. However, poor cell survival following transplantation will hinder clinical progression. One approach to improve MSCs survival following transplantation is to couple the cell engraftment procedure with a scaffold thereby providing a physical substrate upon which to eventually complex pro-survival factors. Evaluation of commercially available, clinically accepted materials with an established safety profile will expedite clinical translation. Therefore, this study sought {{to determine if a}} clinically used fibrin scaffold can be utilized as an adjunct to intracerebral cell transplantation without evoking an adverse host or stem cell response. Sixteen male Sprague&# 8722;Dawley rats received bilateral intrastriatal transplants of 30 000 GDNF-transduced MSCs delivered in either control transplantation medium or a fibrin scaffold. Rats were sacrificed 1, 4, 7, and 14 days post-transplantation. Brains were analyzed to determine in situ polymerization and biodegradability of the fibrin scaffold, GDNF release from transplanted GDNF-MSCs, survival of the GDNFMSC graft and the host s immune response to the transplant. This study found that fibrin scaffold was adaptable to intracerebral delivery with successful polymerization of the fibrin scaffold in situ. Inclusion of the fibrin scaffold was not detrimental to cell survival nor did it impede neurotrophin release from entrapped cells. Importantly, the inclusion of the fibrin scaffold was associated with a reduced host astroglial and microglial response compared to cells alone indicative of a favorable biocompatibility profile. Overall, fibrin represents an adaptable scaffold for inclusion in a minimally invasive cell-based therapeutic approach for {{neurodegenerative disease}}s...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} optimal generation of design-specific cell libraries. In <b>cell-based</b> integrated <b>circuit</b> design, a cell library defines the final {{quality of a}} design. Hence, use of a general-purpose cell library {{may lead to a}} poor quality. We address various issues regarding optimal generation of design-specific cell libraries, targeting high-performance digital circuit design. The goal of {{the first part of the}} dissertation is to provide the key components required to successfully realize the automatic generation of design-specific cell libraries, which consists of cell logic type selection and drive strength type selection. Chapter 2 addresses feasibility issues on transistor-level optimization. During transistor-level optimization, cell layout synthesis and characterization steps are the major bottlenecks with respect to runtime. To resolve this drawback, we present a fast and accurate prelayout estimation technique of cell characteristics. Our estimation technique is based on quick transistor placement. Given a transistor-level circuit of a cell, layout parasitics are estimated using quick transistor placement. Then, the cell is characterized by simulating an estimated circuit which is built according to the estimated layout parasitics. Experimental results on a 0. 13 um industrial standard cell library demonstrate that the proposed technique estimates the cell characteristics with a reasonable accuracy in a negligibly small amount of time. Chapter 3 addresses a cell logic type selection problem for design-specific cell libraries. Our methodology consists of two steps: logic-rich cell library generation and cell logic type count minimization. We propose a cell logic type count minimization method which minimizes the logic type count iteratively under performance constraints. Experimental results on the ISCAS 85 benchmark suite in an industrial 90 nm technology demonstrate that it is feasible to find the minimal set of cell logic types under performance constraints. Chapter 4 addresses a performance-constrained cell count minimization problem for continuously-sized circuits. After providing a formal formulation of the problem, we propose an effective heuristic for the problem. The proposed hill-climbing heuristic iteratively minimizes the number of cells under performance constraints such as area, delay and power. Experimental results on the ISCAS 85 benchmark suite in an industrial 90 nm technology demonstrate its effectiveness. We also discuss several implementation issues towards a practical application of the proposed method to large-scale circuits. The second part of the dissertation focuses on transistor-level topology synthesis, which is an important component in the manual generation phase where portions of a circuit are manually identified and cells for the portions are synthesized at the transistor level. We present three transistor-level topology synthesis methods. Although their objectives are to minimize the transistor count, they have different solution spaces. Combining these methods, the minimum solution in larger solution space can be obtained. Chapter 5 presents a method for synthesis of minimal static CMOS circuits where the solution space is restricted to the circuit structures which can be obtained by performing algebraic transformations on an arbitrary prime-and-irredundant two-level circuit. The circuit structures are implicitly enumerated via structural transformations on a single graph structure, then a dynamic-programming based algorithm efficiently finds the minimum solution among them. Experimental results on a benchmark suite targeting standard cell implementations demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed procedure. We also demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm by a numerical analysis on randomly-generated problems. It is also shown that the proposed procedure sometimes generates significantly smaller circuits compared to conventional approach. Chapter 6 presents an exact method for minimum logic factoring which can be viewed as the synthesis of a static CMOS compound gate. We first introduce a novel graph structure, called an X-B (eXchanger Binary) tree, which implicitly enumerates binary trees. Using this X-B tree, the factoring problem is compactly transformed into a quantified Boolean formula (QBF) and is solved by general-purpose QBF solver. Experimental results on artificially-created benchmark functions show that the proposed method successfully finds the exact minimum solutions to the problems with up to 12 literals. Chapter 7 studies the synthesis of read-once switch networks in which every variable appears only once. The proposed procedure is based on the notions of prime implicants and unateness, which establish a basis for Boolean expression synthesis. We also propose a pruning technique for an efficient search. Experimental results on randomly-generated problems with up to 20 switches demonstrate that the proposed procedure successfully solves about 90 % of the problems in 10 minutes each and the resulting read-once switch networks are up to 78 % smaller compared to series-parallel switch networks. Chapter 8 conducts an experimental study using a circuit consisting of C 432 and C 499 from the ISCAS 85 benchmark suite as a design example. We compare the circuits synthesized with a typical cell library and optimal design-specific libraries in an industrial 90 nm technology, and demonstrate that using the design-specific cell libraries, the area-delay tradeoff curve is shifted to the left-bottom from that using the typical library. Comparing between the area-optimal circuits, the area is improved by 27. 3 %. And, comparing between the delay-optimal circuits, the maximum delay is improved by 22. 4 %. These results clearly prove the effectiveness of the flow and the key components for optimal generation of design-specific cell libraries. 報告番号: 甲 22279; 学位授与年月日: 2007 - 03 - 22; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(工学); 学位記番号: 博工第 6484 号; 研究科・専攻: 工学系研究科電子工学専...|$|R
