5|$|In <b>computational</b> <b>geometry,</b> the duality between Voronoi {{diagrams}} and Delaunay triangulations {{implies that}} any algorithm for constructing a Voronoi diagram can be immediately converted into an algorithm for the Delaunay triangulation, and vice versa. The same duality {{can also be}} used in finite element mesh generation. Lloyd's algorithm, a method based on Voronoi diagrams for moving a set of points on a surface to more evenly spaced positions, is commonly used as a way to smooth a finite element mesh described by the dual Delaunay triangulation. This method improves the mesh by making its triangles more uniformly sized and shaped.|$|E
5|$|The classic {{point in}} polygon test from <b>computational</b> <b>geometry</b> applies the above ideas. To {{determine}} if a point lies within a polygon, one casts a ray from infinity to the point and counts {{the number of times}} the ray crosses the edge of polygon. The crossing number is even if and only if the point is outside the polygon. This algorithm works because if the ray never crosses the polygon, then its crossing number is zero, which is even, and the point is outside. Every time the ray does cross the polygon, the crossing number alternates between even and odd, and the point at its tip alternates between outside and inside.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, John Mauchly {{made the}} first mention of binary search {{as part of the}} Moore School Lectures, the first ever set of lectures {{regarding}} any computer-related topic. Every published binary search algorithm worked only for arrays whose length is one less than a power of two until 1960, when Derrick Henry Lehmer published a binary search algorithm that worked on all arrays. In 1962, Hermann Bottenbruch presented an ALGOL 60 implementation of binary search that placed the comparison for equality at the end, increasing the average number of iterations by one, but reducing to one the number of comparisons per iteration. The uniform binary search was presented to Donald Knuth in 1971 by A. K. Chandra of Stanford University and published in Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming. In 1986, Bernard Chazelle and Leonidas J. Guibas introduced fractional cascading as a method to solve numerous search problems in <b>computational</b> <b>geometry.</b>|$|E

In this work, we briefly summarize {{the recent developments}} for methods and related applications in <b>computational</b> conformal <b>geometry.</b> There are two major approaches, holomorphic differentials and curvature flow. Holomorphic differential method is a linear method, which is more efficient and robust to triangulations with lower quality. Curvature flow method is nonlinear and requires higher quality triangulations, {{but it is more}} flexible. The conformal geometric methods have been broadly applied in many engineering fields, such as computer graphics, vision, geometric modeling and medical imaging. The algorithms are robust for surfaces scanned from real life, general for surfaces with different topologies. The efficiency and efficacy of the algorithms are demonstrated by the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Many {{statistical}} models are algebraic {{in that they}} are defined in terms of polynomial constraints, or in terms of polynomial or rational parametrizations. The parameter spaces of such models are typically semi-algebraic subsets of the parameter space of a reference model with nice properties, such as for example a regular exponential family. This observation leads to the definition of an ‘algebraic exponential family’. This new definition provides a unified framework for the study of {{statistical models}} with algebraic structure. In this paper we review the ingredients to this definition and illustrate in examples how <b>computational</b> algebraic <b>geometry</b> can be used to solve problems arising in statistical inference in algebraic models.
