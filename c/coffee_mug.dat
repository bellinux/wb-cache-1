5|$|As {{noted by}} Pavel Alexandrov and Hermann Weyl in their obituaries, Noether's {{contributions}} to topology illustrate her generosity with ideas and how her insights could transform entire fields of mathematics. In topology, mathematicians study {{the properties of}} objects that remain invariant even under deformation, properties such as their connectedness. A common joke is that a topologist cannot distinguish a donut from a <b>coffee</b> <b>mug,</b> since they can be continuously deformed into one another.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{in their}} Philadelphia apartment, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Jim find their living styles are {{increasingly}} clashing. Jim is slovenly, leaving dirty dishes {{to soak in}} the sink until someone else washes them, while Darryl is so fastidious about his possessions that he puts labels with his name on all of them, even a bag of flour. When Darryl takes issue with Jim using his labeled <b>coffee</b> <b>mug,</b> the two begin bickering. Eventually the two come to understand each other's habits better, and relieve tension by playing a video game together.|$|E
25|$|Intuitively, two {{spaces are}} homeomorphic {{if one can}} be {{deformed}} into the other without cutting or gluing. A traditional joke is that a topologist cannot distinguish a <b>coffee</b> <b>mug</b> from a doughnut, since a sufficiently pliable doughnut could be reshaped to a coffee cup by creating a dimple and progressively enlarging it, while shrinking the hole into a handle.|$|E

500|$|The {{official}} website for The Office included three cut scenes from [...] "Broke". In the first 90-second clip, Michael is running late because he overslept, and he instinctively {{runs into the}} Dunder Mifflin office by accident instead of his Michael Scott Paper Company office. In the second one-minute clip, Andy is angry that he cannot find his personalized <b>coffee</b> <b>mug</b> with his face on it, and {{he and the others}} around the office complain about losing their clients to Michael's new company. In the final 80-second clip, stress drives Ryan to the breaking point and he begins trashing the Michael Scott Paper Company Office, for which he quickly recovers and apologizes.|$|E
500|$|While Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{leaves with}} Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to sign closing papers {{for his new}} condominium, the staff fills out their expense reports. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) [...] "dies" [...] of boredom, and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) revives him by calling him to the {{reception}} desk and throwing objects into Dwight's <b>coffee</b> <b>mug.</b> Jim discovers that his co-workers have their own office games, such as Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) [...] "Dunderball", and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) and Oscar Martinez's (Oscar Nunez) [...] "paper football flicking and hitting" [...] game. Jim and Pam organize the Games of the First Dunder-Mifflin Olympiad, competing for hand-made medals constructed from yogurt lids and paper clips.|$|E

500|$|... "Casual Friday" [...] {{included}} several callbacks to previous episodes. The {{scene in which}} Michael pretends to fire Pam, and she tells him, [...] "Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore," [...] is {{a reference to the}} first episode of The Office, in which Michael pretends to fire Pam as a prank and she becomes very upset, which he then does exactly to Erin. Michael compares the difficult choice of choosing between renting the movies The Devil Wears Prada and Sophie's Choice, both of which star Meryl Streep. The reference to the former film is a callback to the cold open to fourth season episode, [...] "Money", in which Michael discusses having watched the movie recently and acts rudely toward Pam in the same fashion as Miranda Priestly, the film's antagonist, who is played by Streep. [...] When Dwight is writing the secret messages, he uses Ryan's <b>coffee</b> <b>mug,</b> that Kelly gave to him from the [...] "Customer Survey" [...] episode, to hold the urine.|$|E
500|$|The Mr. Hankey {{character}} {{was based on}} an idea Trey Parker's father created when he was toilet-training Trey as a child. Parker said he refused to flush the toilet as a child, so his father told him if he did not flush down his stool, which he called [...] "Mr. Hankey", it would come to life and kill him. The concept stayed with Parker throughout his childhood; starting in elementary school and throughout his entire education, he would often draw the character in class, wearing a sailor's hat instead of the Santa Claus hat he would later wear in South Park. Parker shared the concept with future South Park co-creator Matt Stone when the two met at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and the duo immediately knew they wanted to create a film or production involving Mr. Hankey. The two discussed filming a three-minute short film involving a boy who befriended the talking stool, but Mr. Hankey would not come alive for anybody else, prompting others to believe the boy was crazy. They planned for the boy's parents to find him holding a stool in the bathroom and blame the child for smearing feces along the walls when it was actually Mr. Hankey's fault; they also planned to have him visit a school counselor, where Mr. Hankey would leap into the counselor's <b>coffee</b> <b>mug</b> and the boy would be blamed. At the end, it would turn out that the boy was indeed crazy and Mr. Hankey was not real at all, but a figment of the boy's imagination. Parker and Stone never made the short film, but practically all of its elements were included in the future South Park episode [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", with the notable exception of the ending.|$|E

2500|$|On August 11, 2011, {{major news}} media in Utah {{reported}} that Anderson had denounced the Democratic Party and had resigned his {{membership of the}} party.

[...] He added: [...] "I'm done with the Democratic Party. As I said on Amy Goodman's show a couple years ago, I've put my 'Proud Democrat' <b>coffee</b> <b>mug</b> in storage.

2500|$|The {{new term}} {{starts with a}} number of minor yet inexplicable occurrences. For {{the first time in his}} life, Straitley's {{register}} goes missing without ever turning up again. Also, his <b>coffee</b> <b>mug</b> is no longer at the place in the Common Room where it has sat for many years. Pupils report that various objects are missing from their classrooms or lockers. In particular, a 13-year-old Jewish boy from Straitley's form deplores the alleged theft of his expensive fountain pen, a Bar Mitzvah present. Presently, the boy's mother accuses the school and especially Straitley of anti-Semitism. Soon afterwards, a pupil in Straitley's class nearly dies, following another malicious trick, and closely guarded secrets in the lives of the St Oswald's staff are anonymously revealed. Life at St Oswald's begins to suffer a gradual disintegration. One morning, after the discovery of a computer virus on the school's computer system, Pat Bishop is arrested, because child pornography has been downloaded onto his computer and paid for with his credit card. Bishop denies this, but the damage to his career has been done. Meanwhile, a mysterious figure called [...] "Mole" [...] publishes in the local newspaper damaging allegations about St Oswald's.|$|E
