25|$|In 1964, {{the three}} Princesses were all {{purchased}} by Eoin Mekie {{on behalf of}} Aero Spacelines, who planned to use them as heavy-duty freight aircraft for transporting Saturn V rocket components for NASA. When the <b>cocooning</b> was removed, {{it was found that}} they were badly corroded (the contract for maintenance and inspection of the stored aircraft had been allowed to lapse, which resulted in the airframes deteriorating rapidly), and all three Princesses were broken up by 1967. They were the last fixed-wing commercial aircraft produced by Saunders-Roe. The company constructed one more fixed-wing design, the Saunders-Roe SR.53 mixed-power (rocket and turbojet) fighter design; aside from that venture, the company primarily concentrated its efforts on helicopters and hovercraft after this point.|$|E

It featured thematic ideas such as <b>cocooning</b> and thread-weaving that she would later explore on Vespertine. Björk had released her previous studio album, Homogenic, in 1997. The album was highly acclaimed on its initial release and stylistically differed from her previous two releases, described by her as [...] "very emotionally confrontational and [...] very dramatic". The singer also described [...] "All Is Full of Love" [...] — Homogenics closing track — as the first song on Vespertine, as it opposed the rest of the album's [...] "aggressive, macho" [...] aesthetic. In 2000, she starred in Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark, and composed its soundtrack, [...] The filming process was conflictive. Von Trier believes the problem was two-fold: they were both used to being the [...] "dictator" [...] over their products, and Björk was unable to separate herself from her character while acting. Björk wrote [...] "he has to destroy [...] during the filming" [...] and declared that she would never make another movie. Her performance was praised: the film was awarded the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and she received the Best Actress award. On 25 March 2001, Björk attended the 73rd Academy Awards — as [...] "I've Seen It All" [...] was nominated for Best Original Song — wearing a swan dress designed by Marjan Pejoski that caused a media frenzy and was widely criticized.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{quantitative}} trait loci (QTLs) associated with <b>cocoon</b> traits in silkworms were mapped in 44 individuals of a backcross of Dazao females with hybrid F 1 males; the hybrid males were from females of inbred C 100 strain, which have white <b>cocoons</b> and superior <b>cocoon</b> traits, crossed with males of inbred strain Dazao, which have green <b>cocoons</b> and inferior <b>cocoon</b> traits. Nineteen putative major QTLs of silkworm <b>cocoon</b> traits, five QTLs of whole <b>cocoon</b> weight, four QTLs of <b>cocoon</b> shell weight, six QTLs of pupa weight, and four QTLs of <b>cocoon</b> shell rate were scattered across nine linkage groups.

50|$|Work ants in F. rufa {{have been}} {{observed}} to practice parental care or perform <b>cocoon</b> nursing. A worker ant goes through a sensitive phase, where it becomes accustomed to a chemical stimulus emitted by the <b>cocoon.</b> The sensitive phase occurs at an early and specific period. An experiment was conducted by Moli et al. to test how worker ants react to different types of cocoon: homospecific and heterospecific <b>cocoons.</b> If the worker ant is {{brought up in the}} absence of <b>cocoons,</b> it will show neither recognition nor nursing behaviour. Both types of <b>cocoons</b> are opened up by the workers and devoured for nutrients. When accustomed to only the homospecific <b>cocoons,</b> the workers collect both types of <b>cocoons,</b> but only place and protect the homospecific <b>cocoons.</b> The heterospecific <b>cocoons</b> are neglected and abandoned in the nest and eaten. Lastly, if heterospecific <b>cocoons</b> were injected with extract from the homospecific <b>cocoons,</b> the workers tend to both types of <b>cocoons</b> equally. This demonstrates that a chemical stimulus from the <b>cocoons</b> seems to be of paramount importance in prompting adoption behaviour in worker ants.
