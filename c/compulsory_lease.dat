40|$|The {{power of}} {{compulsory}} acquisition {{has always been}} an important aspect in the acquisition of land for public purposes in the history of PNG. The Power, however, was abused during the colonial era by virtue of the fact that too many occuppied lands were acquired by the Colonial Administration. These acquisitions led first, to shortage of land {{in many parts of the}} country and second, domination of Papua New Guinea's economy by foreigners, especially plantation economy. The successive post - Independence Governments of PNG have adopted an overall policy to redress the situation by acquiring foreign owned lands and redistributing them to nationals for subsistence farming or economic development so that they may participate in the economic development of the country. This work examines the law relating to compulsory acquisition of land in PNG. In particular it examines the policies, laws and practices aimed at compulsory acquisition. of land and their effects on the landowners. The work also proposes reforms to the laws relating to compulsory acquisition of land in PNG. The thesis proposes several reforms to the law relating to compulsory acquisition of land in th,e country. 1. That the power of compulsory acquisition in PNG continue as it is essential to acquire lands the Government needs for development purposes in the interest of the greater national community. However, an amendment to the provisions of the Land Act is necessary to introduce a system of H <b>compulsory</b> <b>lease</b> " to replace the current system of compulsory acquisition. 2. That the payments of compensation to the dispossessed citizen owner, especially an automatic citizen, should be over and above the market value of the land compulsorily acquired to reflect the extra market values or non - economic values that Papua New Guineans often attached to their land. However, the situation regarding payments of compensation to remedy grievances caused by colonial land acquisitions requires urgent review as there appears to be no proper guidelines for such payments and it has proved to be unnecessarily costly to the nation. That the payment of compensation to the dispossessed non - citizen owner should be less thanthe concept of the market value of the land. The Government should pay the dispossessed non - citizen landowner compensation based on what it considers just. 3. The imposition of two months time - limit under the present Land Act within which landowners are required to respond to a notice to treat is unrealistic and should be extended to six months as most of the customary landowners are still in the remote rural areas with poor communication and transportation systems. However, provisions be inserted in the Land Act to establish a minimum time - limit within which the Government must complete the compuslory acquisition once a notice to treat has been issued. The absence of such a time - limit could cause injustice to the landowners as months or years may elapse before the procedure for the acquisition is effected...|$|E

Through this Act, the Australian Government seized administrative control of sixty remote indigenous communities, attained <b>compulsory</b> <b>leases</b> on indigenous settlements {{for a minimum of}} a five-years and enacted legislation to act on these changes. As a result, [...] "all communities located on the Aboriginal inalienable freehold land under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act of 1976 would have their permit systems revoked." ...|$|R
40|$|Book synopsis: This book {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between space, subjectivity and property in order to invert conventional socio-legal understandings of property. Sarah Keenan demonstrates that new political possibilities for property may be unveiled by thinking about property in terms of space and belonging, rather than exclusion. Drawing on feminist and critical race theory, this book shifts focus away from the propertied subject {{and on to the}} broader spaces in and through which the propertied subject is located. Using case studies, such as analyses of <b>compulsory</b> <b>leases</b> under Australia’s Northern Territory Intervention and lesbian asylum cases from a range of jurisdictions, Keenan argues that these spaces consist of networks of relations that revolve around belonging: not just belonging between subject and object, as property is traditionally understood, but also the less explored relation of belonging between the part and the whole. This book therefore offers a conceptually useful way of analysing a wide range of socio-legal issues. It will be of relevance to those working in the area of property and legal geography, but also to those with more general interests in socio-legal studies, social and political theory, postcolonial studies, critical race studies and gender and sexuality studies...|$|R
50|$|RAF Woodcote In September 1941 the RAF {{announced}} that four new Equipment Dispersal Depots were then under construction and that No.70 Woodcote {{was one of}} them it was to be placed in No.40 Group, Maintenance Command.A Headquarters Site and 3 separate sites, one to three miles apart and not unduly conspicuous from the air and therefore difficult to attack, needed to be built. The attraction of the local area was the ancient beech woodlands {{on the edge of the}} village, most of which was owned by Christ Church, Oxford. The woodland provided a natural camouflage from the air. A total of over 176 acres of mixed woodland and open pasture bordered by some 7 miles of winding country lanes was requisitioned on <b>compulsory</b> <b>leases</b> from a number local landowners on a total compensation rental of £100 pa. Site 3 covered 63½ acres on the edges of the road to Exlade Street. The site to the west of the road and also bordering Deadmans Lane was owned by Christ Church, Oxford University, whilst the site to the east was owned by Lawrence Hignett of Hook End Farm.The initial establishment was 8 RAF Officers and 476 civilians and during the next few months the civilian establishment was increased to 755.the role of this Unit was to hold a range of stores for the use of the RAF.Evidence of the huge amount of equipment, stores and buildings hidden in the local woods can still be seen in Abbey Wood with large concrete foundations, water storage tanks and blast shelters.|$|R
5000|$|The Australian Government is {{committed}} to providing voluntary five-year leases and will not extend the measure for <b>compulsory</b> five-year <b>leases</b> in the Northern Territory Emergency Response Act. In addition, [...] "the Australian Government and Northern Territory Government will continue negotiate leases with Aboriginal landowners to manage social housing in remote areas." [...] Furthermore, the legislation allows for the Australian Government to instate regulations that ease leasing on town camp and community living area land in the Northern Territory {{in order to encourage}} Aboriginal landowners to use their land for a wider range of functions such as economic development and private land ownership. The Australian Government in collaboration with the Northern Territory Government seek to ensure the establishment of fair standards for social housing provisions by non-governmental organisations. In addition, beginning in areas with township leases, both Governments ensure that building protections are applied in remote communities of the Northern Territory.|$|R
