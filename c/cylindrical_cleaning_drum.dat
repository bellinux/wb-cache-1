40|$|Abstract. Lauroyl {{chloride}} is synthesized by {{the reaction}} of phosphorus trichloride and lauroyl acid. It is, in turn, oxidized by a toluene solution of hydrogen peroxide and sodium peroxide to manufacture lauroyl peroxide (LPO). As a retrospective case, a <b>cleaning</b> <b>drum</b> exploded during transfer of the toluene layer including LPO to the filter after separation of the aqueous phase. It is speculated that plant managers did not fully apprehend the hazardous decomposition of LPO, or could not make operators understand it. This study investigated the reaction hazards in the manufacturing process to forestall explosion in the manufacturing of LPO by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and TSS model simulations...|$|R

25|$|The du Temple was {{an early}} naval {{water-tube}} boiler, patented in 1876. It was invented by Félix du Temple in France and was tested in a Royal Navy torpedo gunboat. Water tubes were convoluted, arranged in four rows to a bank, and S-shaped with sharp right angle bends. This packed a large tube heating area into a small volume, but made tube <b>cleaning</b> impractical. The <b>drums</b> were cylindrical, with perpendicular tube entry and external downcomers between them.|$|R

40|$|Field {{trials of}} the predacious copepod Mesocyclops longisetus Thiubaud were {{conducted}} in northeastern Mexico to determine {{the effectiveness of this}} species to control larval Aedes aegypti (L.) populations and to survive and reproduce in nature. Groups of 200, 50, and 50 ovigerous M. longisetus females were inoculated into 200 -liter metal drums, discarded tires, and cemetery newer vases, respectively, which are 3 of the more important Aedes breeding sites in this area. Larvae were sampled at 15 -d intervals, and total surviving cyclops were collected {{at the end of the}} study, 120 d later. Community participation was solicited through a simple training program on copepod rescue before <b>drum</b> <b>cleaning</b> and facilitated by the addition of a drum marker to remind residents of copepod presence. Results showed good cooperation and after 4 mo all peridomestic drums still supported variable numbers of cyclopoids. Average of larvae reduction was 37. 5 % for drums, 67. 5 % for flower vases, and 40. 9 % for tires. This study shows difficulties of using cyclopoids for tires and vases in areas where prolonged dry seasons dessicated these habitats and reduced copepod survival...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Chlorine bleach and {{detergent}} {{are routinely}} used by householders in El Progreso, Honduras {{in the process}} of <b>cleaning</b> washbasins and <b>drums,</b> the two most important larval habitats of Aedes aegypti in the city. The efficacy of these materials in eliminating eggs, larvae, and pupae of Ae. aegypti was assessed under controlled conditions. The promising results obtained led to trials using a combination of chlorine bleach and detergent to apply to the walls of washbasins and drums as a method for eliminating eggs. The bleach maintained its ovicidal properties when mixed with detergent, and the detergent gave the mixture consistency so that it could be applied as a thin film to the walls. This new procedure was named the little dab (Untadita in Spanish) and allows households to direct their efforts against a stage of the mosquito life cycle that has been ignored in the past: the egg. The first confirmed cases of dengue in Honduras occurred in 1977. Since that time dengue transmission has become endemic, and large epidemics were documented in 1978, 1987, 1989, 1991, and 1995. 1 All four dengue serotypes are now circulating in the country, and there were at least 30 confirmed cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever during the most recent epidemic in 1995.

50|$|The printer {{contains}} melted wax when at operating temperature, and owners' manuals {{warn that}} it cannot be moved {{until it has}} completed a special cool-down cycle selected from the machine's control panel. It is recommended to provide a 30-minute cool down time {{from the point of}} removing main power, however all modern solid-ink printers have a shutdown cycle which use fans to solidify the ink in less than ten minutes, with the added benefit of physically restraining the printhead to prevent damage during moving or shipping. The manuals warn that substantial damage is possible otherwise, requiring servicing by a trained technician if not properly cooled down before moving the printer. Moving the printer before cool down completes can damage the print head by spilling molten ink between reservoirs of different color as well as over other components inside the printer (motors, belts, etc.), and is not covered under maintenance or warranty. Because of the liquid-ink-spillage concern, solid-ink printers are not suitable for mobile usage, such as on movable carts for printing pricing tags in retail settings. Unlike some inkjet printers where the cartridge includes the print head, the printhead in these printers is fixed. Over time, parts of the printhead may become permanently clogged, resulting in unsightly streaks, but there are printhead and <b>drum</b> <b>cleaning</b> cycles and jet-substitution options which can resolve most printing issues. There is a filter for the ingested ink implemented at least on the recent ColorQube devices (8570/8870), according to a service manual for those models. Dust caused by the use of cheap paper may cause printhead clogging, which is why Xerox recommends the use of papers that are not prone to giving off dust and fibers during regular usage. Paper dust may also accumulate as debris inside the printer; this could cause abrasions on the drum and may mimic a weak or missing jet. For this reason, the basic built-in drum-cleaning procedure is therefore recommended to be invoked at least three times before initiating printhead-nozzle cleaning cycle. The printhead system also contains a wiper-assembly unit that is used to wipe the printhead from dust, debris and residual ink, {{in order to protect the}} nozzles from clogging. Overall, the design of this system is robust: printheads have been known to last one million prints or more. Ink blocks are not compatible between Phaser models, due to Xerox changing each CMYK molded shape with each new model release due to changes in the formulation (and especially melt point) of the ink. Special openings prevent the insertion of ink sticks from the wrong model, or the wrong slot. Lamination becomes difficult due to the nature of the ink technology. The ink melts and becomes smeared unless the laminator temperature is reduced to just enough to seal a pouch.|$|R
40|$|Background: Very {{little is}} known about work and health in the sisal industry. Previous studies on sisal are old and mainly focused on sisal fibre {{textiles}} and rope factories. Stationary dust concentration rather than personal exposures has been measured in a few studies but not bio-aerosols content of sisal dust. Globally, Tanzania occupies a third place in annual sisal export. Production methods in Tanzanian sisal factories are still labour intensive, implying that many workers are currently employed in the country’s 82 sisal estates. Yet very {{little is known}} about work-related health risks among sisal workers in Tanzania. Methods: Six sisal processing factories were selected for the study. Walkthrough surveys were conducted in the decortication and brushing departments and all 165 sisal processing workers (exposed) in these departments (including 93 decorticators, 72 brushing) and 32 randomly selected security guards (low exposed) were {{invited to participate in the}} study. Daily interviews on acute respiratory symptoms arising during or after work, and assessment of peak expiratory flow rates before and after work shifts were performed from Monday to Friday. All sisal workers and security guards were also interviewed for chronic respiratory symptoms. Thirty-eight randomly selected sisal workers were involved to collect personal dust samples using 30 cellulose acetate and 48 polycarbonate filters for gravimetric dust analysis and for bacteria and fungi spore counting, respectively. Furthermore, 138 out of 165 sisal processing workers and 78 conveniently sampled urban-based control participants were skin prick tested with dry and fresh sisal extracts. Serum samples from a subset of 43 skin pricked participants were tested for total and sisal specific IgE, PhadiatopTM, and ELISA. A fresh sisal extract was examined by SDS PAGE (electrophoresis method) to look for sisal allergen proteins. Results: Walkthrough surveys indicated generally poor working conditions in five of the six sisal factories, with workplaces characterized by wet floors, visible dust emissions, long stressful work shifts, monotonous tasks at awkward postures and heavy manual lifting. Use of personal protective equipment and other general occupational health and safety services was almost absent. Old brushing and decortication machinery from as early as the 1890 s was still in use. The arithmetic mean exposure of all sisal processors was 1. 18 mg thoracic dust/m 3, 43 x 106 bacteria /m 3, and 2. 35 x 106 fungal spores/m 3. The highest mean thoracic dust (2. 06 mg/m 3), bacteria spores (230 x 106 /m 3) as well as fungal spores (15. 10 x 106 /m 3) were measured when <b>cleaning</b> corona <b>drums</b> at the decortication. Personal exposure measurements showed significant differences in thoracic dust levels and bacteria exposures between work departments and workers tasks. Positive correlations were found between fungal and bacteria counts (r = 0. 47; p = 0. 01; n = 32), but no significant differences were detected among the study groups for fungal exposure. Mixed effect models including the brushing and decortication departments explained 64. 7 % of the thoracic dust exposure variance between workers. The models also showed that working in the brushing department was a significant exposure determinant (p = 0. 04) After the first day of work (Monday), and when compared to security guards, odds ratios for sisal processing workers were for sneezing 4. 2 (95 %CI; 1. 6 – 11. 1) and for dry cough 2. 9 (95 %CI; 1. 3 – 5. 4) after adjusting for age, smoking and past respiratory illnesses. Compared to decortication workers, brushing workers had significantly higher odds ratio for sneezing; 3. 2 (95 %CI; 1. 6 – 6. 2) and stuffy nose 3. 1 (95 %CI; 1. 4 – 7. 0). With the exception of shortness of breath and wheezing, brushing workers had significantly higher prevalence for all acute respiratory symptoms than decortication workers. During the five days of follow-up, brushing workers showed significantly higher severity scores and prevalences for most acute respiratory symptom than security guards and decorticators. Compared to security guards, workers in decortication had significantly higher prevalence of shortness of breath. A significantly decreasing trend across the week was found for the prevalence of shortness of breath among brushing workers (from 39 % to 20 %: P 100 kU/L) IgE levels. Analysis of the sisal extract showed two IgE binding protein bands at 45 kDa. Discussion and conclusion: The combined effect of poor working conditions, use of old machinery and lack of protective clothing implies increased health risks due to possible exposures to sisal dust and bio-aerosols among sisal processing workers. Sisal processing workers had significantly higher severity scores and prevalence of respiratory symptoms, and were more sensitized to sisal than controls, indicating a possible association with exposure arising within the sisal fibre processing areas. Dust and bio-aerosol exposure levels appear to be higher for some tasks, emphasizing the need to consider differences in workers tasks when assessing workplace exposures and when planning control measures. Preventive action and more studies are recommended in this industry...|$|R
