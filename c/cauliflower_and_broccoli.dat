40|$|Sensory {{properties}} are reported {{as one of}} the main factors hindering an appropriate vegetable intake by the young. In the present work the sensory determinants of likings for vegetables were explored in adolescents of four European countries (Denmark, n =  88; France, n =  206; Italy, n =  110 and United Kingdom, n =  93). A questionnaire was designed to study cross country differences in stated liking for and familiarity with a list of vegetables popular among European markets (between-vegetable approach). A within-vegetable comparison approach with actual tasting was used to analyze differences and similarities in liking for canned pea and sweet corn samples across the countries. A close positive relationship between stated liking and familiarity was found. Irrespective of the country, one group of highly liked vegetables (carrots, tomatoes, green salad) was identified, characterized by innately liked tastes (sweet, umami), delicate flavour and bright appealing colour. A second group of highly disliked vegetables consists of <b>cauliflowers</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli,</b> characterized by disliked sensations such as bitter taste and objectionable flavour. Internal Preference Maps from actual liking scores indicate that the generally disliked tastes (bitter, sour), are clearly correlated with a negative hedonic response for both peas and sweet corn. The hedonic valence of a generally well accepted taste such as salty and texture descriptors depends on the type of vegetable. Internal preference maps from actual liking data indicate that flavour and appearance descriptors of the distinct sensory properties of each type of vegetable positively affect liking, while the intensity of unusual flavours is related to sample disliking...|$|R

40|$|In {{coastal regions}} of Mediterranean areas, summer crops are often {{irrigated}} with saline water. As a consequence, salts may accumulate in the root zone, damaging the following winter crops if the rainfall {{is insufficient to}} leach them. In 1994 and 1996 we investigated the effect of residual salts from the previous summer irrigations on plant growth, yield and mineral composition of <b>cauliflower</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli,</b> two non-irrigated winter crops. The salt treatments for the irrigated summer crops were four concentrations of commercial sea salt, corresponding to ECw of 2. 3 (S 1), 4. 4 (S 2), 8. 5 (S 3) and 15. 7 dSm− 1 (S 4), plus a non-salinized control (NSC 0. 5 dSm− 1). An increase of the electrical conductivity of the saturated-soil extract (ECe) from 2. 0 dSm− 1 (NSC) to 6. 0 dSm− 1 (S 4) caused {{a decrease in the}} marketable yield from 26. 9 to 9. 6 t ha− 1 and from 15. 8 to 4. 9 t ha− 1 in <b>cauliflower</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli,</b> respectively. A 55 and 57 % salt induced leaf area reduction was observed in <b>cauliflower</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli,</b> respectively. Leaf dry matter concentration and specific leaf weight were positively correlated with ECe. In contrast, head weight and diameter were negatively correlated with ECe. Based on the Maas and Hoffman bi-linear model we ranked <b>cauliflower</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli</b> as moderately tolerant crops. The ECe thresholds were 1. 52 and 1. 28 dSm− 1 and the relative yield reductions per unit increase in ECe above the threshold were 14. 4 and 15. 8 % for <b>cauliflower</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli,</b> respectively. Assessment of the relative yield as a function of soil pH revealed an 80 and 119 % yield reduction per pH unit increase above a 7. 2 and 7. 12 threshold for <b>cauliflower</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli,</b> respectively. Head concentration of Na, Cl, S and Fe increased with soil ECe whereas N, P and K decreased. Overall, residual soil salinity and salt-induced permanent modifications of the soil physical–chemical properties affected both growth and yield of non-irrigated <b>cauliflower</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli</b> crops...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Vegetable pollen {{is a rare}} {{source of}} {{occupational}} allergens. Occupational allergy has only been described {{in the case of}} paprika pollen and tomato pollen. We describe a new source of occupational pollen allergy. AIM: To study the incidence and the impact of broccoli and cauliflower pollen allergy in employees involved in classical plant breeding. METHODS: Fifty-four employees of five companies working with cauliflower (Brassica oleracea botrytis) and broccoli (B. oleracea italica/cymosa) pollen were eligible for complete evaluation. Allergy to <b>cauliflower</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli</b> pollen was evaluated by questionnaire and determination of sensitization by radioallergosorbent test (RAST) and skin-prick tests (SPT). SPT and RAST were performed with a panel of commercial and homemade extracts from <b>cauliflower</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli</b> pollen. RESULTS: Work-related symptoms such as rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthma and urticaria caused by B. oleracea pollen were reported by 44 % of the participants (24 / 54), of whom all but one had positive SPT for cauliflower- and/or broccoli-pollen/flower extracts and 58 % (14 / 24) had positive RAST results. Symptoms had developed within the first 2 years in 33 % of the patients. Six patients had to stop or change work.

50|$|Bagrada hilaris is {{a species}} of shield bug known by the common names bagrada bug and painted bug (See a short video at YouTube). It could be mistaken for or erroneously {{referred}} to as harlequin bug. It is native to Asia. It is known elsewhere as an introduced species, including California and Arizona, where {{it was first reported}} in 2008. It is a major pest insect of Brassica oleracea crops (including cabbage, kale, <b>cauliflower,</b> Brussels sprouts, <b>and</b> <b>broccoli),</b> <b>and</b> related crucifers such as turnips, rape, and mustard. The adult and nymph of the species suck sap from the leaves of the plants, causing wilting, yellowing, and stunting of growth. Besides crucifers, the bugs are known on papaya, sorghum, maize, potato, cotton, caper, pearl millet, and some legumes. Large numbers of the bug congregate on the plants and cause extensive damage.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. RNA-dependent RNA {{polymerase}} (RDR) {{activities were}} readily detected in extracts from <b>cauliflower</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli</b> florets, Arabidopsis thaliana (L.)

A loss-of-functionmutation in RDR 1, RDR 2 or RDR 6 did not significantly reduce the amount of cRNA synthesis. This indicates that these RDRs did not account for the bulk RDR activities in plant extracts, and suggest that either the individual RDRs each contribute a fraction of polymerase activity or another RDR(s) is predominant in the plant extract...|$|E

50|$|Some of the {{vegetables}} that rabbits enjoy are escarole, turnips, collards, kale, parsley, thyme, cilantro, dandelion, and basil. The green, leafy tops of radish and carrots also are excellent sources of nutrients—more than the vegetable itself. New vegetables should be introduced slowly {{due to the}} delicate digestive systems of rabbits. It is recommended that <b>cauliflower,</b> <b>broccoli</b> <b>and</b> cabbage be avoided, as they cause gas {{and can lead to}} gastrointestinal stasis, which can be fatal. Vegetables such as potatoes and corn should also avoided due to their high starch content.

50|$|Erysiphe cruciferarum is a plant {{pathogen}} {{of the family}} Erysiphaceae, that causes the main powdery mildew of crucifers, including on Brassica crops, such as <b>cauliflower,</b> cabbage, <b>broccoli,</b> <b>and</b> Brussels sprouts. E. cruciferarum is distributed worldwide, and is of particular concentration in continental Europe and the Indian subcontinent. E. cruciferarum is an ascomycete fungus that has both sexual and asexual stages.

40|$|The {{enlarged}} inflorescence (curd) of <b>cauliflower</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli</b> provide {{not only}} a popular vegetable for human consumption, but also a unique opportunity for scientists who seek to understand the genetic basis of plant growth and development. By the comparison of quantitative trait loci (QTL) maps constructed from three different F(2) populations, we identified a total of 86 QTL that control eight curd-related traits in Brassica oleracea. The 86 QTL may reflect allelic variation in as few as 67 different genetic loci and 54 ancestral genes. Although the locations of QTL affecting a trait occasionally corresponded between different populations or between different homeologous Brassica chromosomes, our data supported other molecular and morphological data in suggesting that the Brassica genus is rapidly evolving. Comparative data enabled us to identify a number of candidate genes from Arabidopsis that warrant further investigation to determine if some of them might account for Brassica QTL. The Arabidopsis/Brassica system is an important example of both the challenges and opportunities associated with extrapolation of genomic information from facile models to large-genome taxa including major crops...|$|E
40|$|The Brassicaceae family {{comprises}} about 3000 species, {{the majority}} of which {{are found in the}} Northern Hemisphere. Many common agricultural weeds, such as Brassica nigra (L.) Koch, Brassica rapa L., Cardaria draba (L.) Desv., Raphanus raphanistrum L., and Sinapis arvensis L., belong to this family. The most important crop species from this family are the oilseed Brassicas; Brassica napus L., B rapa L., and B juncea Coss., which are generally referred to as rapeseed, oilseed rape, or canola. Other widely cultivated species in this family are: B. oleracea L. (cabbage, kale, kohlrabi, Brussels sprouts, <b>cauliflower,</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli),</b> B. chinensis L. (syn. B. napus var. chinensis; Chinese cabbage), Raphanus sativus L. (radish), and Armoracia rusticana Gaertn. (horseradish). We agreed to limit our discussion to the rapeseed species because they are the focus of most of the gene transfer technology.

40|$|The genus Xanthomonas is {{composed}} of several species that cause severe crop losses around the world. In Latin America, {{one of the most}} relevant species is Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, which is responsible for black rot in cruciferous plants. This pathogen causes yield losses in several cultures, including cabbage, <b>cauliflower</b> <b>and</b> <b>broccoli.</b> Although the complete structural genome of X. campestris pv. campestris has been elucidated, {{little is known about the}} protein expression of this pathogen in close interaction with the host plant. Recently, a method for in vivo analysis of Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri was developed. In the present study, this technique was employed for the characterization of the protein expression of X. campestris pv. campestris in close interaction with the host plant Brassica oleracea. The bacterium was infiltrated into leaves of the susceptible cultivar and later recovered for proteome analysis. Recovered cells were used for protein extraction and separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Proteins were analysed by peptide mass fingerprinting or de novo sequencing and identified by searches in public databases.
