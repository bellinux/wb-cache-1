40|$|In the ofice. it {{is often}} {{necessary}} to scan a picture at a certain resolution and then reproduce it at a different (usually higher) resolution. This conversion {{can be achieved by}} interpolating the scanned signal between the sample intervals. This paper discusses a class of linear interpolating methods based on resampling polynomial functions. In addition, we introduce new methods to compare the performance of these interpolating schemes. The signal models used are one-dimensional step and pulse functions. These bi-level models are suficient to describe many blacklwhite documents. The performance of the linear interpolators is determined by evaluating their accuracy in reconstructing the original bi-level signal. The analysis considers the effects of the <b>coarse</b> <b>scan</b> and fine print intervals well as as the quantization effects. Experiments using the IEEE facsimile chart as input verifv the analytical findings. The results show the advantage of using odd-order polynomials, such as the first order and TR W cubic.

40|$|Indoor mapping and {{modelling}} {{requires that}} acquired data be processed by editing, fusing, formatting the data, amongst other operations. Currently the manual interaction the user has {{with the point}} cloud (data) while processing it is visual. Visual interaction does have limitations, however. One {{way of dealing with}} these limitations is to augment audio in point cloud processing. Audio augmentation entails associating points of interest in the point cloud with audio objects. In <b>coarse</b> <b>scan</b> registration, reverberation, intensity and frequency audio cues were exploited to help the user estimate depth and occupancy of space of points of interest. Depth estimations were made reliably well when intensity and frequency were both used as depth cues. Coarse changes of depth could be estimated in this manner. The depth between surfaces can therefore be estimated with the aid of the audio objects. Sound reflections of an audio object provided reliable information of the object surroundings in some instances. For a point/area of interest in the point cloud, these reflections can be used to determine the unseen events around that point/area of interest. Other processing techniques could benefit from this while other information is estimated using other audio cues like binaural cues and Head Related Transfer Functions. These other cues could be used in position estimations of audio objects to aid in problems such as indoor navigation problems...|$|R

40|$|Forearm {{rotation}} (pro-/supination) {{involves a}} non-trivial combination of rotation and trans-lation of two bones, namely, radius and ulna, relatively to each other. Early works regarded this relative motion as a rotation about a fixed (skew) axis. However, this assumption turns {{out not to}} be exact. This thesis regards a spatial-loop surrogate mechanism involving two de-grees of freedom with an elastic coupling for better forearm motion prediction. In addition, the influence of the bone morphology and position of elbow on kinematics are also consid-ered. The model parameters are not measured directly from the anatomical components, but are fitted by reducing the errors between predicted and measured values in an optimization loop. For non-invasive measurement of bone position, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is employed. We present a method to self-calibrate the arm position in the MRI scanning tube and to fit the model parameters from a few, <b>coarse</b> MRI <b>scans.</b> Results show a good con-cordance between measurement and simulation.

40|$|Ion trap based mass spectrometers {{are widely}} used in {{chemical}} analysis. A typical mass spectrometer is a stationary laboratory instrumentation that is inconvenient for on-site chemical detection tasks. In recent years, more and more efforts have been put to develop the portable mass spectrometry system. Ion trap, the mass analyzer, is {{a key component of}} the mass spectrometer. A miniature ion trap not only has a reduced size by itself, it also leads the miniaturization of other components, including vacuum manifold, vacuum pump and RF generator. The operating RF voltage is proportional to the square of the ion trap size. The lowered operating RF voltage on the miniature ion trap enables the low-power battery operation as well. With these advantages, miniature ion trap could be a promising candidate that will {{play a major role in}} portable mass spectrometer. In this dissertation, a fabrication methodology of creating polymer-based miniature rectilinear ion trap (RIT) is reported. An advanced manufacturing technique (Stereolithography) is used to fabricate the polymer-based rectilinear ion trap with simulation-guided design method. Simulations of electric field, capacitance associated with the ion trap, ion trajectories and mass spectra are performed for evaluation and optimization purposes. Challenges such as achieving uniform post metallization and high thermal stability are analyzed and solved systematically with the aid of the simulation results. The miniature rectilinear ion trap with dimensions of 1. 67 mm x 1. 33 mm x 16. 7 mm (1 / 3 of the full-sized ion trap) demonstrates a much lower RF operating voltage of 100 V (1 MHz) with a mass range of 300 Th in boundary ejection mode, while a full-sized trap requires 1000 V to achieve the same mass range. By taking the advantage of the lower RF operating voltage, a coil-less RF generator is designed and implemented to provide the RF supply for the miniature ion traps with a much smaller size compared with the LC tank configuration. To prove the functionality of the coil-less RF generator, the RF system on Griffin 600 miniature mass spectrometer is directly replaced with the coil-less generator. Low power, instantaneous multi-frequency mass detection is demonstrated to produce broad mass range <b>coarse</b> <b>scan</b> and high resolution single peak analysis. Mass resolution of 0. 66 Th (FWHM) is obtained at m/z of 69. With the complete elimination of the large size LC tank, coil-less RF generator exhibits an ideal low-power, simple circuit configuration for miniature mass spectrometer. Optimal multi-resolution operation is introduced and it can be realized with the miniature polymer-based RIT and the coil-less RF generator. The combination of the miniature polymer-based rectilinear ion trap and the coil-less RF generator is a unique platform and it makes a big step closer to the handheld mass spectrometer. ...|$|R

The separated size fractions (< 0. 2, 0. 2 - 1. 0, and 1. 0 - 2. 0 mm) consist of illite (90 - 100 %) with small to minute amounts of chlorite and detectable quartz and feldspars in the <b>coarser</b> fractions. <b>Scanning</b> electron microscopic and transmission electron microscopic observations showed two types of illite morphologies: flakes coating detrital framework minerals and laths and fibers invading the pore space.

Microthermometric fluid-inclusion determinations in quartz and calcite characterize two types of percolating fluids: a highly saline (19 % NaCl equivalent) fluid at variable temperatures depending on the reservoirs (185 to 150 °C) and a slightly saline one (2. 6 % NaCl equivalent) again at varied temperatures (170 to 145 °C), also depending on the locations.

40|$|Atomic force microscopes or AFMs are {{instruments}} {{which use}} a mechanical probe to scan a sample and estimate surface topography with nanometer accuracy. The term atomic force originates {{from the fact}} that the imaging process relies upon the existence of the inter-atomic interaction force between the mechanical probe and sample surface. These instruments have established themselves as a vital cutting edge tool for investigation of matter at the nanometer scale. Their widespread usage is due not only to their superior resolution but also because they can operate in any medium namely air, liquid and vacuum. Another major advantage is that, unlike their predecessor instruments AFMs do not require their samples to be conductive. This fact alone has enabled in situ imaging of biological samples with unprecedented resolution and without sample alteration. Other instruments like scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) can also view biological samples, however they require the samples to be prepared and dried. While some sample structure may be preserved, AFMs have no such limitation. Despite the fact that AFMs offer all these advantages, the usage of a mechanical probe for image generation causes them to be inherently reliant upon a feedback control loop. This is because the probe motion must be controlled in a suitable manner to avoid letting its motion dynamics distort the sample image. In addition, since the mechanical probe must be sequentially moved over the sample point by point, the imaging times are long and range from a few seconds to in excess of ten minutes. Given that feedback control is an integral part of AFM operation, the end users are forced to manually tune Proportaional-Integral (PI) controllers which are used in most commercial AFMs. Since the vast majority of scientists using AFMs do not necessarily possess a knowledge of feedback control, they do this tuning though a manual trial and error procedure which consumes valuable research time. Although the control systems community has taken considerable interest in AFM control, the methods suggested often require high order controllers and are tested for a specific experimental set up. The primary objective of this research is therefore to develop a novel automated controller synthesis mechanism which has the potential of being used in a diverse range of AFM setups. The method of choice for this research is Multiple Model Adaptive Control (MMAC). The motivation for this decision as well as experimental verification is provided in detail in this thesis. Given the wide commercial usage of PI controllers, the same are used as a starting point for this work. The applicability of the method suggested is however by no means restricted to them, and in the future can be extended to incorporate more sophisticated controllers, for instance robust controllers. The second objective of this research is to investigate two novel methods which have the potential of substantially reducing the AFM imaging time. The first one suggests <b>coarser</b> <b>scan</b> trajectories to save time, and then estimates the sample image using a relatively new signal processing method called Compressive Sensing. The second method suggested uses the AFM's mechanical probe in a novel manner that can also substantially reduce imaging time...|$|R
30|$|We propose an {{optimized}} dedicated broadband sensing receiver architecture for use {{in cognitive}} radios supporting delay sensitive applications. Specifically, we first reason {{the need for a}} dedicated sensing receiver that employs a combination of <b>coarse</b> and fine <b>scanning</b> to reduce sensing time over a large bandwidth. We derive an expression for mean acquisition/detection time as a function of a number of parameters including the number of coarse and fine frequency bins employed. We then determine the optimal number of coarse and fine bins that minimize the overall detection time required to identify idle channels under various system conditions. Using analytical and simulation results, we quantify the dependence of optimal coarse and fine bin selection on system parameters such as (1) size of FFT used in scanning; (2) probability of detection and false alarm of the underlying sensing algorithm; (3) signal-to-noise ratio of the received signal, and (4) expected number of available channels. The primary contribution of this work lies in a practical realization of an optimal broadband sensing receiver.|$|R

Any other similar composite system of irregular (star-shaped) particles in a matrix can also be simulated. This paper integrates two new algorithms into the Anm model. The first new algorithm is the extent overlap box (EOB) method that detects interparticle contact, {{and the second is}} the capability of adding a uniform-thickness shell to each particle. Parameter analysis has shown that the EOB method leads to a more accurate detection of interparticle contact with a smaller computational cost than the previously used Newton-Raphson method. The uniform-thickness shell provides a customizable tool to control the minimum intersurface distance of particles during the parking process, as well as to simulate processes and microstructure that are dependent on the Euclidean distance from a particle surface. For mortar and concrete, the uniform-thickness shell can represent the observed interfacial transition zone (ITZ) structure. A parallel processing application programming interface (API) was integrated into the Anm model to accelerate the particle placement process by parallel optimization, which results in significant improvements in the packing efficiency on multicore processor systems. This significant speedup as well the improved contact function and new uniform-thickness shell algorithm greatly extend the range, size, and type of particle systems that can be studied...|$|R

It follows that {{the arrangement of}} atoms at the surfaces of crystals profoundly influences biological components at many levels, from cells through biopolymers to single organic molecules. Many {{studies have focused on}} the crystal-molecule interface in water using large, flat single crystals. However, little is known about atomic-scale surface structures of the nm- to μm-sized crystals of simple metal oxides typically used in batch adsorption experiments under conditions relevant to biogeochemistry and the origins of life. Here, we present atomic-resolution microscopy data with unprecedented detail of the circumferences of nanosized rutile (α-TiO 2) crystals previously used in studies of the adsorption of protons, cations and amino acids. The data suggest that one third of the { 110 } faces, the largest faces on individual crystals, consist of steps at the atomic scale. The steps have the orientation to provide under-coordinated Ti atoms of the type and abundance for adsorption of amino acids as inferred from previous surface complexation modeling of batch adsorption data. A remarkably uniform pattern of step proportions emerges: the step proportions are independent of surface roughness and reflect their relative surface energies. Consequently, the external morphology of rutile nm- to μm-sized crystals imaged at the <b>coarse</b> scale of <b>scanning</b> electron microscope images is not an accurate indicator of the atomic smoothness or of the proportions of the steps present. Overall, our data strongly suggest that amino acids attach at these steps on the { 110 } surfaces of rutile...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that Maillard reactions {{contribute to the}} formation of new soil organic matter (SOM) was investigated. Specific objectives of the research were to determine whether smectites (type of smectite and their associated saturating metal cations) and synthetic Al-substituted goethites catalyze the Maillard reaction leading {{to the formation of}} humic-like compounds under abiotic conditions and to determine the distribution of newly formed humic materials into mineralogical distinct clay-size fractions. To investigate clay catalysis of the Maillard reaction, four smectites and four synthetic Al-substituted goethites were incubated with arginine (or glycine peptides) + glucose solutions for 21 days at 37 °C under abiotic conditions. The results indicate that smectites {{and to a lesser extent}} goethites were capable of catalyzing dehydration of glucose to form furfural compounds and levulinic acid. Glucose dehydration was affected by the type of saturating cation on the clay; Al 3 + enhanced monosaccharide dehydration whereas Fe 3 + inhibited monosaccharide dehydration. In goethites + peptide + glucose systems, as Al substitution on goethites increased, cleavage of the peptide bond increased. The transformation products in the systems (sorbed C + N) are believed to be co-polymerization products of furfural compounds and levulinic acid and amino containing compounds. To determine the relationship between clay mineralogy and the distribution of newly formed humic materials, a Monona soil was fractionated into mineralogical distinct fractions. The Monona soil had been previously labeled with 14 C through the decomposition of labeled Oat roots. The total organic C and total N content in the fine clay (dominated by interstratified smectite/illite) and coarse clay (dominated by quartz) fractions were similar. However, the new 14 C preferentially accumulated in the fine clay fraction relative to the <b>coarse</b> clay fraction. <b>Scanning</b> electron micrographs reveal diffuse humic materials on the surfaces smectites in the fine clay fractions, suggesting that new humic materials are preferentially forming or accumulating on soil smectite surfaces.

This study aimed to investigate the morphology of soil aggregates of different size classes of a Red-Yellow (LBd) and a Dusky Red Latosol (LVdf) located in two respective natural toposequences, in Paraná State, Brazil, using scanner images. Undisturbed soil samples of the Bw 1 and Bw 2 horizons were collected in four LBd profiles and three profiles of the LVdf toposequence. After drying, the aggregates were separated into six size-classes (2 - 4 mm; 1 - 2 mm; 0. 5 - 1 mm; 0. 25 - 0. 5 mm; 0. 105 - 0. 25 mm; < 0. 105 mm), to determine the percentage mass distribution and geometric mean diameter (GMD). Aggregate images of the four <b>coarsest</b> size-classes were <b>scanned</b> and processed by UTHSCSA Image Tool. The aggregate shape of both soils was predominantly polyedric, with high roughness, which supposedly increases the external surface area of aggregates.

The aggregate roundness increased with the decrease in aggregate size, i. e., smaller aggregates {{seemed to be more}} spherical and less rough. The clay mineralogy was related with both size and surface morphology of the aggregates. In some size classes of the LBd and LVdf horizons, an increased GMD and area, the preferential growth in one axe (lengthiness) and the external roughness reduction of the structures were favored by the kaolinite content in the clay fraction. The opposite effect was verified for Fe and Al oxides...|$|R
