30|$|Blood parrot is {{a hybrid}} of female Cichlasoma synspilum and male Cichlasoma citrinellum artificially cross-bred in Taiwan as early as 1980 s (Yang et al. 2012). Currently, Blood parrot {{is one of the}} most popular and high-value {{ornamental}} fish because of its bright body color, their size is often 10 – 12  cm. At present, they can be breed and produced with commercial feed in fish farm. Nonetheless, the fish cannot synthesize their own carotenoid color. As the body color is the major factor that affects the market value of ornamental fish, enhancing it by supplementing pigments in diets is therefore necessary (Gouveia et al. 2003; Mills and Patterson 2009; Olson and Owens 1998). Astaxanthin is a pigment widely used in the foodstuff and forage industries as a dietary supplement for developing prospects (Spiller and Dewell 2003). In aquaculture, the carotenoids can be produced synthetically and are commonly used for pigmentation of fishes; furthermore, alternative natural carotenoid sources (yeast, algae, higher plants, and <b>crustacean</b> <b>meal)</b> have also been studied (Büyükçapar et al. 2007; Chatzifotis et al. 2011; Teimouri et al. 2013; Kalinowski et al. 2007; Lee et al. 2010; Pham et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2006; Whyte and Sherry 2001). In addition, carotenoids were reported to be able to change antioxidant activity of fish (Pham et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2006).|$|E
40|$|Apparent {{dry matter}} {{digestibility}} (ADMD) and apparent protein digestibility (APD) of four isonitrogenous practical diets (40 % crude protein) containing {{different combinations of}} marine animal protein sources prepared from fisheries by-products were determined for juvenile Penaeus monodon (average weight 4. 65 f 0. 99 g). An indirect method using chromic oxide (Cr,O,) as an indicator was employed for the determination of digestibility. The diet formulations tested contained mollusc and <b>crustacean</b> waste <b>meals</b> (scallop and shrimp head, diet Dl) and fish and <b>crustacean</b> waste <b>meals</b> (sardine and lobster, diet D 2; sardine and shrimp head, diet D 3). Diet D 4 contained commercially available fish and <b>crustacean</b> <b>meals</b> (anchovy and shrimp). In addition, all diets contained soya-bean meal, wheat flour and rice pollard as plant protein sources except for diet D 3 in which the diverse plant protein sources were replaced by lupinseed meal. The ADMD and APD values of the three diets Dl, D 2 and D 4 were similar {{with a range of}} 75. G 78. 1 % and 92. 0 - 92. 8 %, respectively. The diet combining sardine and shrimp head meals with lupinseed meal (D 3) had significantly lower ADMD and APD values of 53. 2 % and 85. 4 %. respectively, than the other three diets.

40|$|The {{digestibility}} of pre-selected ingredients {{was evaluated}} for Epinephelus morio using pH-stat and multi-enzyme extract (stomach, intestine, and ceca). The {{degree of hydrolysis}} (DH) was tested with acid and alkaline proteases using <b>crustacean</b> <b>meals,</b> squid meal, fish protein concentrate (FPC), fish meal, dried whey, as well as canola paste (w/ or w/o phytase), soybean meal (w/ or w/o phytase), soyprotein concentrate (SPC), and wheat gluten. SPC produced DH values between 3. 6 - 4. 1 %, obtained from the three {{different parts of the}} digestive tract. Canola paste produced high DH in the stomach by adding phytase to 0. 8 and 2 % feed. This process was repeated under alkaline conditions for DH, with 0. 6 - 2. 6 % in the pyloric ceca, and 1 - 2. 2 % in the intestine. The DH from stomach with <b>crustacean</b> <b>meals</b> (shrimp meal and crab meal) ranged from 32 - 87 %, while values for dried whey from the ceca and intestine ranged from 6 - 7. 4 %. It did not differ from crab meal with values of 4. 5 and 8. 7 % from pyloric ceca and intestine respectively. Based on the above results, 4 diets were developed using shrimp meal, dried whey, soy protein concentrate, and canola+phytase. The DH, FAA (fish amino acid) and SDS-PAGE (analysis of protein gels) for each diet were analysed. After an in vivo test, results on juveniles fed whey protein diet (WPd) and CPd+ ranked high (95 % and 92 % respectively) compared with other treatments. pH-Stat provided consistent results regarding digestibility of selected protein sources. Therefore, dried whey, shrimp meal, and canola+phytase ranked first to be included in E. morio feed formulation with a pool of 55 % of these components, complemented with a minimum of fish meal, FPC, grains and wheat glute...|$|R
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} with Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua (L.), to determine the apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs) of protein and energy and the digestible energy (DE) content in feed ingredients widely available in Canada. We also tested the assumption of 2 ̆ 01 cindependency 2 ̆ 01 d used in digestibility studies. The feed ingredients included two fish meals (herring, anchovy), three <b>crustacean</b> by-product <b>meals</b> (whole krill, crab, shrimp), two animal by-product meals (poultry by-product, hydrolyzed feather), six oilseed meals (soybean, soy protein concentrate, soy protein isolate, canola, canola protein concentrate, flaxseed), two pulse meals (white lupin, pea protein concentrate) and two cereal grain meals (corn gluten, wheat gluten). Protein ADCs were high for wheat gluten meal (99. 9...|$|R
