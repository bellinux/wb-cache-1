40|$|A deep-sea core over 16 m long {{from the}} crestal {{area of the}} Mediterranean Ridge has been {{investigated}} with different techniques, including quantitative micropaleontology, stable isotopes (measured on the epipelagic species Globigerinoides ruber and on the mesopelagic species Globorotalia inflata), and clay mineralogy. The resulting record of climatic fluctuations can be cross correlated to other Mediterranean cores by means of isochronous lithologies (tephra layers and sapropels). The climatic record of the Mediterranean is similar in <b>character,</b> <b>phase,</b> and chronology to the records investigated in the equatorial Pacific and in the Caribbean. Isotope stages 1 to 17 have been recognized. Cyclically repeated stagnant cycles resulting in sapropel deposition complicate both the isotopic and the faunal signal. The isotopic investigations reveal that the temperature change in the surface layers of the eastern Mediterranean was no greater than 8 °C in the late "glacial" Pleistocene. The chronostratigraphic and biostratigraphic interpretation of Core KS 09 indicate that the mean sedimentation rate was 2. 4 cm/ 1000 years, a value {{very close to the}} 2. 5 cm/ 1000 years calculated for the entire Quaternary section at DSDP Site 125, also located in the crestal area of the Mediterranean Ridge in the Ionian Basin.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{of water}} absorption in epoxide materials was studied by {{the aid of}} a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A-triethylenetetramine (DGEBA-TETA) epoxy-resin system containing various amounts of the plasticizer THIOCOL (0 - 40 phr). The presence of plasticizer permits the formation of products with different crosslinking densities and hydrophilic characters. Dynamic water absorption experiments were carried out at 15, 40, and 70 degrees C. For the fitting of the experimental results, a new model was used, based on a model proposed earlier by Jacobs and Jones. This model considers epoxide product as a two-phase system consisting of a master phase (where the major part of the water is absorbed), which is homogeneous and nonpolar (phase 1), and of a second phase with different density and/or hydrophilic <b>character</b> (<b>phase</b> 2). By making the assumption that water diffusion can take place independently in the different phases of the material in accordance with Fick's second law, we can calculate the diffusion coefficient D and the water content at saturation M-infinity for each phase separately. Equilibrium water sorption measurements were performed at 40 degrees C, and the data were analyzed and discussed based on the Guggenheim-Anderson- de Beer (GAB) equation, the results being in support of the two-phase model used in the analysis of absorption kinetics. The linear expansion coefficient and the glass transition temperature of the materials, employed in the discussion of the results, were measured by thermomechanical analysis.

40|$|Perylene bisimide (PBI) {{derivatives}} are {{n-type semiconductor}} materials {{widely used in}} a variety of optoelectronic devices. Great efforts have been devoted to the synthesis of soluble PBIs to allow processing by inexpensive solution-state methods. Recently, water-soluble compounds are receiving special attention for their potential in the fields of biology and “green” organic electronics. There is also a growing interest in the development of liquid crystalline PBIs, in order to improve the supramolecular organization and hence the transport performance. This work reports the first investigation of the mobility measured by the time-of-flight technique and the photoconductive response of the perylene derivative N,N′-bis[1 -(2, 5, 8, 11 -tetraoxadodec- 1 -yl) - 3, 6, 9, 12 -tetraoxatridec- 1 -yl]-perylene- 3, 4 : 9, 10 -bis(dicarboximide) (PBI-W), which is simultaneously water-soluble and liquid-crystalline. For comparison purposes, a parallel investigation with the commercial derivative N,N′-bis(1 -hexylheptyl) -perylene- 3, 4 : 9, 10 -bis(dicarboximide) (PBI-C 6), which is neither liquid-crystal nor water-soluble, has also been carried out. The conductive spectral response and the mobility dependence on the strength of the applied electric field were studied in order to optimize mobility measurements conditions. The mobility was determined as a function of temperature from room temperature (22 °C) up to 100 and 120 °C, for PBI-W and PBI-C 6, respectively. Results are discussed in correlation with the crystalline or liquid-crystalline <b>character</b> <b>phase</b> of the material.

40|$|Hydrological and hydrogeological {{dynamics}} along mountain slopes control {{many important}} phenomena, such as shallow landslide triggering and flood generation. The governing factors include: soil thickness, slope and bedrock morphology, rainfall pattern and subsurface groundwater conditions, {{both in the}} vadose zone and under the water table. We present {{the results of a}} monitoring project undertaken on a large slope parcel in the Alpine region of northern Italy. Both direct (piezometers, tensiometers, etc.) and indirect (geophysical) methods have been used to characterize slope and bedrock morphology as well as changes in soil moisture content over time. In this note, we focus {{on the use of the}} ground-penetrating radar (GPR) in surface-to-surface configuration. Recently, the use of multi- and single-offset GPR has been advocated for intermediate scale monitoring of moisture content changes in agricultural soils, e. g. in vineyards. We investigate the applicability of similar techniques to hillslopes. The monitoring has been performed using a PulseEkko 100 radar system. The estimation of the soil moisture content is based on the differential arrival time of direct waves through the air and the soil itself. GPR data can also provide information about the bedrock morphology, with special regard to the degree of fracturing. Care must be taken in data interpretation, because the GPR signal propagates in the soil layer as a guided wave, having a dispersive <b>character</b> (<b>phase</b> velocity is function of frequency) and possibly different modes. Consequently, the wave’s first arrival at a different offset cannot be simply interpreted as a direct wave through the shallow soil layer. Inversion of the dispersion curve – phase velocity versus frequency – must be performed to yield velocity and thickness of the soil layer as well as velocity of the bedrock. We show that GPR data, properly processed and inverted, carry significant information about the site structure and hydrological dynamics of mountain slopes...|$|E
