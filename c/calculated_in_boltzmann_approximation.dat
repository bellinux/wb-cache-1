For the case of an energy-dependent amplitude the problem cannot be reduced to the differential equation but the solution of the original integro-differential equation can be found in terms of the Taylor expansion, which in the case of aconstant amplitude shows a perfect agreement with the perturbative solution of the differential equation. Corrections to the spectrum of (possibly) massive tau-neutrinos are calculated.

It permits {{to calculate the}} average amplitude and the average intensity for one-photon states of the full transverse electromagnetic field in a dilute medium of unpolarized atoms. Special emphasis is laid upon an analysis in terms of irreducible representations of the rotation group. It allows to sum explicitly the ladder and maximally crossed diagrams, giving the average intensity <b>in</b> the <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>approximation</b> and the interference corrections responsible for weak localization and coherent backscattering. The exact decomposition into field modes shows that the atomic internal degeneracy contributes to the depolarization of the average intensity and suppresses the interference corrections.

40|$|We discuss {{resonant}} leptogenesis {{arising from}} the decays of two nearly-degenerate right-handed neutrinos, identified as the inflaton and stabiliser superfields in a model of chaotic sneutrino inflation. We compare an analytical estimate of the baryon asymmetry η_B <b>in</b> the <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>approximation</b> to a numerical solution of the full density matrix equations, and find that the analytical result fails to capture the correct physics in certain regions of parameter space. The observed baryon asymmetry can be realised for a breaking of the mass degeneracy as small as O(10 ^- 8). The origin of such a small mass splitting is explained by considering supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking in supergravity, which requires a constant in the superpotential {{of the order of}} the gravitino mass m_ 3 / 2 to cancel the cosmological constant. This yields additional terms in the (s) neutrino mass matrices, lifting the degeneracy and linking η_B to the SUSY breaking scale. We find that achieving the correct baryon asymmetry requires a gravitino mass m_ 3 / 2 ≥O(100) TeV.

40|$|The surface {{impedance}} approach {{is discussed in}} connection with the precise calculation of the Casimir force between metallic plates. It allows {{to take into account the}} nonlocal connection between the current density and electric field inside of metals. In general, a material has to be described by two impedances Z_s(ω,q) and Z_p(ω,q) corresponding to two different polarization states. In contrast with the approximate Leontovich impedance they depend not only on frequency ω but also on the wave vector along the plate q. In this paper only the nonlocal effects happening at frequencies ω<ω_p (plasma frequency) are analyzed. We refer to all of them as the anomalous skin effect. The impedances are calculated for the propagating and evanescent fields <b>in</b> the <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>approximation.</b> It is found that Z_p significantly deviates from the local impedance as a result of the Thomas-Fermi screening. The nonlocal correction to the Casimir force is calculated at zero temperature. This correction is small but observable at small separations between bodies. The same theory can be used to find more significant nonlocal contribution at ω∼ω_p due to the plasmon excitation. Comment: 29 pages. To appear in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

The potential to disentangle different energy deposition scenarios is explored by utilizing two different transport approaches {{for the early}} non-equilibrium evolution. In the hadronic transport approach the particle production in high energy heavy ion reactions is mainly governed by string excitation and fragmentation processes which are absent in the parton cascade approach. We find that in both approaches the initial state shows a strong longitudinal correlation of the event plane angles which is diluted but still persists in the final state momentum space distributions of the produced particles. A ridge-like structure can also be caused by near-collinear gluon radiation in a parton cascade approach and does not necessarily prove longitudinal flux tubes in the initial state.

40|$|Electronic {{devices are}} vital for our modern life. Semiconductor devices {{are at the}} core of them. Semiconductor devices are governed by the {{transport}} and behavior of electrons and holes which in turn are controlled by Fermi-Level or the Quasi-Fermi Level. The most frequently used approximation for the population of electrons and holes based on the <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>approximation</b> of Fermi-Dirac distribution. However when the Fermi-level is closer to the majority carrier band edge, by less than 3 kT, it causes significant errors in the number of the carriers. This in turn causes errors in currents and other quantities of interest. In heavily doped semiconductors, it is desirable to use Fermi-Dirac Integral itself. However this is a tabulated function and therefore approximations are developed. Most of the approximation are mathematically cumbersome and complicated and they are not easily differentiable and integrable. Although several approximations have been developed, some with very high precision, these are not simple nor are they sufficiently useful in semiconductor device applications. In this thesis after exploring and critiquing these approximations, a new set of approximations is developed for the Fermi-Dirac integrals of the order 1 / 2. This analytical expression can be differentiated and integrated, still maintaining high accuracy. These new approximation {{is in the form of}} an exponential series with few terms using Prony’s method. Application of this approximation for semiconductor device calculations are discussed.
