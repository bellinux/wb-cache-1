50|$|With the {{departure}} of Todd, the Department of Posts & Telegraphs appointed the Inter-Governmental Philatelic Corporation (IGPC), based in New York, as its sole, worldwide agent that permitted IGPC to design and print stamps against a royalty. During the IGPC time, two issues would bear the legacy of Burt Todd: the gold coins of 1975 and the 3D traditional masks series of 1976. Otherwise their issues would show the typical IGPC staple of thematic and commemorative sets and souvenir sheets, in general hardly related to the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> and {{with the use of}} high face-value stamps with no local postal usage. Furthermore, the sales income from IGPC decreased dramatically since mid 1986.|$|E

5000|$|This {{exercise}} {{illustrates the}} difficulty for {{the authors of}} international conventions of producing a perfectly neutral text. A truly balanced approach would probably have consisted in reintroducing in the substantive law governing securities {{certain aspects of the}} law of thecountry of the issuer. This method, known under the name of [...] "look-through approach", would thus have allowed that, in the event of bankruptcy of an American intermediary, American investors holding securities issued by European issuers would have the possibility to rivindicate these securities by following the rivindication procedures provided under the legislation of the latter. However, one must also acknowledge that the result would probably also have been greater complexity, the administrator of an intermediary in bankruptcy being obliged to apply different procedures for recovery depending on the <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> of the securities.|$|E

40|$|Modern new {{biotechnology}} {{has the potential}} to provide major economic and other benefits, {{but at the same time}} it poses potential hazards for human health, the environment, the ‘natural’ biological order and can have adverse socio-economic consequences. The application of such technology frequently violates traditional ethical, moral and religious values. This paper after outlining possible benefits of modern new biotechnologies, discusses the type of biosafety risks which they pose, their possible adverse consequences for the sustainability of biodiversity and agriculture and their potential impacts on socioeconomic welfare and traditional cultures. Particular concern is expressed about the possible consequences of such technologies for developing countries and the practice in some developed <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>issuing</b> patents conferring very broad rights over the use of genetically engineered material. Because these rights are so broad in some cases they have the potential to establish powerful multinational monopolies in the hands of private companies. Global debate about these issues suggest that more emphasis should be given globally to the socio-economic consequences of such technology than in the past. The need for this is highlighted by the North-South divide. Developing countries lag considerably in this new technological field, are placed in a dependant position and have weak institutional structures to control the application of such technology...|$|R
