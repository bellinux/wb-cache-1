40|$|We take {{a dynamic}} {{perspective}} on insurance markets under adverse selection and study a dynamic {{version of the}} Rothschild and Stiglitz model. We investigate the nature of dynamic insurance contracts by considering both conditional and unconditional dynamic contracts. An unconditional dynamic contract has insurance companies offering contracts where {{the terms of the}} contract depend on time, but not on the occurrence of past accidents. <b>Conditional</b> dynamic <b>contracts</b> make the actual contract also depend on individual past performance (such as in car insurances). We show that dynamic insurance contracts yield a welfare improvement only if they are conditional on past performance. With <b>conditional</b> <b>contracts,</b> the first-best can be approximated if the contract lasts long. Moreover, this is true for any fraction of low-risk agents in the population.

5000|$|The Purple Hotel, {{located at}} the corner of Lincoln and Touhy avenues, has a place in local lore. The hotel was built in 1960 by the Hyatt Corp. and was {{originally}} called the Lincolnwood Hyatt House. Well-known Chicago pianist Myles Greene, who now performs at Tuscany's in Oak Brook, was the first performer to open in the hotel 40 years ago. In 1983, convicted mobster- insurance executive Allen Dorfman was gunned down in the hotel parking lot. The murder has never been solved. The hotel changed hands numerous times after the infamous crime, first becoming a Radisson, and then a Ramada. But vaguely criminal associations have nonetheless persisted, especially after prominent reports of [...] "wild", [...] "drug-fueled" [...] parties taking place in 2004 in connection with allegations of political fixing. [...] Since 2004, it has been independent, simply calling itself by the name locals have used for years: the [...] "Purple Hotel." [...] The name came about because of the building's distinctive purple facade, somewhat radical for earth-toned suburbia. In 2006, the Village sued the owners of the Purple Hotel because of health and safety code violations such as mold in guest rooms. In January 2007, it was announced the hotel was to be closed, with future plans unknown. In May 2007, Chicago-based Sertus Capital Partners entered into a <b>conditional</b> <b>contract</b> to purchase the 8 acre hotel property, with plans to demolish the famed hotel and build residential and retail space. However, Sertus called off its proposed purchase of the Touhy Avenue property from the current owner Donald Bae in August 2007. The plans were scrapped due to the high cost that owners asked for the property and problems with an extended lease of one of the tenants on the property. In 2010, the Village again brought court action to either remedy more than three dozen building code violations, or demolish the building. [...] In February 2011, the Village was granted authority to condemn and demolish the Purple Hotel at the owner's expense. In late 2011, Weiss Properties and North Capital Group bought the hotel's mortgage note with intentions to restore the hotel with additional amenities. However, the hotel was demolished in August 2013.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to analyze philosophically {{about the existence of}} a hybrid contract (english) or al-‘Uqûd al-Murakkabah (Arabic) or multiakad (Indonesia). Search focused on the opinion of scholars of hadith and fiqh (muamalah), as well as its application in Islamic Financial Institutions.

By using qualitative and literature method, the study concluded that, firstly, fiqh muamalah contemporary view of the hadith related to contract hybrid models lead to the editorial about the ban of bai’ataini fi bai’atin (two sale and purchase in the sale), ban of shafqataini fi shafqatin (two agreements in the deal) and the prohibition of bay’ and the salaf (sale and purchase agreement and ordering of goods), secondly, the construction of contract hybrid models in Islamic banks is addressed to the construction of al- ‘Uqûd al-Mutaqâbilah (dependent or <b>conditional</b> <b>contract),</b> which implemented on Guarantee Bank (BG), and al-‘Uqûd al-Mujtami'ah (same type contract), which implemented on the Housing Financing...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experiment}} that investigates the effects of reciprocity and reputation on credit market performance. To do so, we replicate the three treatments carried out by Fehr and Zehnder (2005) in their experiment and introduce some alterations. More precisely, in our experiment, participants are matched by pairs exogenously so they have the opportunity of reputation building. Furthermore, our experiment allows us to investigate the effect of information on reputation building. In the first treatment called partner no information a lender and a borrower are matched for the all duration of the experiment. The second treatment (stranger no information) is identical to the previous one except that it is played under a stranger matching protocol. The third treatment (partner information) solely differs from the first one {{by the fact that the}} lenders have access to the project selected by the borrowers and the project outcome. The last treatment (Third party no information) allows for the introduction of a third party in charge of enforcing the contracts whereas in the three conditions aforementioned the contracts are not enforceable by an exogenous force. Our results show that an honour-based market – wherein participants cannot build up long term relationship – is not viable on the long run because borrowers have no repayment incentives, though a significant fraction of borrowers reciprocate fair offers. The opportunity to engage bilateral long term relationships strongly improves the market performance by partially mitigating the repayment problem and thus enhancing cooperation between borrowers and lenders. The latter succeed in applying a <b>conditional</b> <b>contract</b> renewal strategy. As a consequence selfish borrowers have an incentive to behave reciprocally. Surprisingly, rendering the information symmetric and transparent between the two parties involved does not improve market performance. This fact seems to highlight the prominence of reputation as a disciplining devise. The presence of an exogenous force in charge of enforcing contract undeniably improves the credit market functioning by solving the repayment problem and thus giving more confidence to the investors but also exacerbates moral hazard associated with project selection. Interestingly, the fact that lenders offer fair financing conditions significantly lowers moral hazar...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 78 - 79) This {{study examines}} the various methods automobile dealers from the Los Angeles area use for converting their automobile <b>conditional</b> sales <b>contracts</b> into working capital. As {{a foundation for}} this discussion, {{an example of a}} <b>conditional</b> sales <b>contract</b> and credit application is explained in detail with emphasis on dispelling confusion often surrounding installment financing. Personal interviews with banking and lending institutions revealed programs offered to automobile dealers for discounting the sales contracts. Interviews with automobile dealers from the Los Angeles area then determined what programs were chosen and why the dealer used it. The study shows that the dealer strives to use a method of discounting sales contracts which is the least expensive and which relieves the dealer of the responsibility for the customer making the payments. A compromise plan is in use today, whereby the dealer and lending institution share in the responsibility of the sales contract's unpaid balance, resulting in less expense to the dealer than if the lending institution were to accept full responsibility for the customer...|$|R
