5|$|Almost a {{thousand}} impact craters on Venus are evenly distributed across its surface. On other cratered bodies, such as Earth and the Moon, craters show {{a range of}} states of degradation. On the Moon, degradation is caused by subsequent impacts, whereas on Earth it is caused by wind and rain erosion. On Venus, about 85% of the craters are in pristine condition. The number of craters, together with their well-preserved condition, indicates the planet underwent a global resurfacing event about 300–600 million years ago, followed by a decay in volcanism. Whereas Earth's crust is in continuous motion, Venus {{is thought to be}} unable to sustain such a process. Without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle, Venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a <b>critical</b> <b>level</b> that weakens the crust. Then, over a period of about 100 million years, subduction occurs on an enormous scale, completely recycling the crust.|$|E

40|$|<b>Critical</b> <b>levels</b> to {{determine}} plant response to ozone (O 3) {{have been used}} in Europe since the 1980 s, utilizing the concentration-based AOT 40 to relate plant response to ambient O 3 exposure. More recently, there has been progress in Europe toward utilizing flux-based <b>critical</b> <b>levels,</b> because plant response is more closely related to O 3 uptake than to the amount of O 3 in ambient air. Flux-based <b>critical</b> <b>levels</b> are plant species specific; data for parameterization of flux-based <b>critical</b> <b>levels</b> models are lacking for most plant species. Although flux-based <b>critical</b> <b>levels</b> are now being used for a limited number of agricultural crops and tree species where data are available, the use of flux-based <b>critical</b> <b>levels</b> is limited by the lack of adequate consideration and incorporation of plant internal detoxification mechanisms in flux modeling. <b>Critical</b> <b>levels</b> have not been used in North America; however, recent interest in the U.

A major obstacle for utilization of <b>critical</b> <b>levels</b> in North America is that ambient air quality standards for O 3 in the U. S. and Canada are concentration based. It appears that cumulative exposure-based metrics, particularly when implemented with a quantification of peak concentrations and environmental variables, such as a drought index, are currently the most useful to relate O 3 to vegetation response.

5|$|Infamous is an action-adventure game set {{in an open}} world {{environment}} and played from a third-person perspective where the player controls Cole and primarily interacts {{with the world of}} Empire City through Cole's newly gained electricity-based powers; these are used for movement, offense and defense in combat, and either for better or worse in dealing with the citizens of Empire City. In order for Cole to use his powers, he must have stored electrical power, represented by a node meter on the player's heads up display (HUD). The player can recharge Cole by draining electricity from powered sources or from living beings; recharging also restores Cole's health, which is indicated by blood splattering onto the screen. The more damage that Cole takes, the more blood that covers the screen. When Cole's health is at a <b>critical</b> <b>level,</b> the screen will turn black and white, and if Cole takes a little bit more damage while the screen is black and white, a heartbeat will be heard and will get slower and slower as Cole takes more damage, until it is beating dangerously slow. At this point, further damage to Cole will kill him. If the player stays out of battle long enough, Cole's health will regenerate over time. The game features seventeen different electrical powers, ranging from simple bolts that do not consume Cole's energy to wide-field lightning storms that drain most of Cole's energy. The player can use such powers, giving the player options in certain situations. For example, the player may fire at a generator near foes to cause it to explode and cripple his opponents, then restrain them or fire at the body to kill the enemy.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWhile {{the ozone}} layer in the {{stratosphere}} is shielding the Earth's surface from radioactivity, high ozone concentrations in the troposphere have damaging effects on plants, animals and humans when they exceed certain <b>critical</b> <b>levels.</b> This {{is why it is}} necessary to resolve successfully three tasks: 1. (i) to determine in a sufficiently accurate way, the <b>critical</b> <b>levels</b> of the ozone concentrations, 2. (ii) to reduce the ozone concentrations to the <b>critical</b> <b>levels,</b> and 3. (iii) to develop reliable and robust control strategies by which the ozone concentrations can be kept under the <b>critical</b> <b>levels.</b> Both the second task and the third task are very expensive. Therefore, the high ozone concentrations must be reduced to the <b>critical</b> <b>levels,</b> but no more. Furthermore, it is necessary to reduce (as much as possible) the economical costs of these actions. Mathematical models can be used in the search of an optimal solution of the tasks listed above. A mathematical model for studying air pollution levels in Europe (the Danish Eulerian Model) will be shortly discussed. The model consists of a system of 35 partial differential equations and leads to huge computational tasks, when it is handled numerically. Therefore, it is necessary to use big modern high-speed computers (with vector and/or parallel capabilities). The Danish Eulerian Model has been used to run various scenarios in order to study some of the relationships between emission sources in Europe and high ozone concentrations. Modern visualization techniques have been applied to illustrate better the effects of different emission reductions used in the scenarios on the ozone concentrations and to draw some conclusions...|$|R

Once the concentration of this substance reaches a <b>critical</b> <b>level</b> (a measure of the number of bacteria in a limited area), transcription of specific other genes that had been repressed are turned on. Once the sequenced autoinducer gene was found to occur widely in gram-negative bacteria quorum sensing became accepted in the early 1990s. It is now known that in many pathogenic bacteria, there is delayed production of toxins, which serve to greatly augment their pathogenicity, this is similar to what happens for luciferase proteins.
