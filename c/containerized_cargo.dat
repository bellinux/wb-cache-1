25|$|Like {{all of the}} Great Lakes, Lake Michigan {{is today}} used as a major mode of {{transport}} for bulk goods. In 2002, 162 million net tons of dry bulk cargo were moved via the Lakes. This was, in order of volume: iron ore, grain and potash. The iron ore {{and much of the}} stone and coal are used in the steel industry. There is also some shipping of liquid and <b>containerized</b> <b>cargo,</b> but most container vessels cannot pass the locks on the Saint Lawrence Seaway because the ships are too wide.

25|$|Historically, the dry {{and liquid}} bulk {{segments}} have generated {{most of the}} canal's revenues. Bulk cargo includes dry goods, such as grains (corn, soy, and wheat, among others), minerals, fertilizers, coal, and liquid goods, such as chemical products, propane gas, crude oil, and oil derivatives. Recently, <b>containerized</b> <b>cargo</b> has replaced dry bulk as the canal's main income generator, moving it to second place. Vehicle carriers have become the third-largest income generator, replacing the liquid bulk segment. Shipping industry analyses conducted by the ACP and top industry experts indicate that the canal expansion will be beneficial to both the canal and its users because of the demand that will be served by allowing the transit of more tonnage.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} how {{to incorporate the}} inventory costs of <b>containerized</b> <b>cargoes</b> into existing liner service planning models such that the designed networks could be improved while not causing extra modeling/computational burden. Two approaches are compared: (i) not considering the inventory costs at all and (ii) incorporating the inventory costs associated with onboard time and those related to transshipment by assuming a fixed connection time. The two models are compared with the ideal model capturing the exact inventory costs on a route choice problem and a capacity planning problem based on extensive randomly generated and practical numerical experiments. The results show that: first, ignoring the inventory costs in service planning models may lead to network design with much higher costs (poor network design decisions); second, in service planning models assuming weekly frequency, the inventory costs associated with onboard time could be formulated exactly, and those related to the connection time of weekly services could be approximated by assuming fixed connection time of 3. 5  days for ports with 1 day’s minimum connection time and 4. 5  days for ports with 2 days’ minimum connection time.

40|$|Management of truck {{transport}} in a {{port area}} {{is important for}} Chinese container ports as heavy traffic congestion not only limits the terminal capacity but also generates serious air pollution. This article explores {{an effective way to}} manage the truck traffic of export containers based on a time window management programme that is widely used in Chinese terminals to facilitate terminal and truck delivery operations. Firstly, the arrangement of time windows is assumed to follow the principle of minimizing transport costs. A cost function includes the costs of truck and driver waiting time, fuel consumption associated with truck idling, storage time of the <b>containerized</b> <b>cargos</b> and yard fee. Secondly, to minimize the total cost, a heuristic is developed based on a genetic algorithm to find a near optimal time window arrangement. The optimized solution involves the position and the length of each time window. Finally, the model and the heuristic are tested using real data from a Chinese container terminal, and the result indicates that optimization of the time window can effectively flatten the peak traffic of export container trucks – one of the primary causes of road traffic congestion in port areas. ...|$|R

40|$|This report covers an {{intelligent}} {{decision support system}} (IDSS), which handles an efficient and effective way to rapidly inspect <b>containerized</b> <b>cargos</b> for defection. Defection is either cargo exposure to radiation, physical damages such as holes, punctured surfaces, iron surface oxidation, etc. The system uses a sorting array triangulation technique (SAT) and surface damage detection (SDD) to conduct the inspection. This new technique saves time and money on finding damaged goods during transportation such that, instead of running $n$ inspections on $n$ containers, only 3 inspections per triangulation or a ratio of $ 3 :n$ is required, assuming $n > 3 $ containers. The damaged stack in the array is virtually detected contiguous to an actually-damaged cargo by calculating nearby distances of such cargos, delivering reliable estimates for the whole local stack population. The estimated values on damaged, somewhat damaged and undamaged cargo stacks, are listed and profiled after being sorted by the program, thereby submitted to the manager for a final decision.
