40|$|Some informations {{obtained}} by the author {{as the result of}} tuna-long-line fishing training carried out near the Maratua Island in the Celebes Sea, with the training-ship Keiten-Maru (269 ton) of our Faculty shall be reported. Up to this day a lot of studies have been done about the vertical tuna-long-line form, but as to horizontal form few studies have been done, as the attentions have been paid chiefly to the fixing of the letting-go-line and heaving-up-line positions and to the counting of the shift and the distance between the both ends of the long-line. Accordingly the track of the horizontal tuna-long-line form was ascertained, by clearly plotting, with the interval of half an hour, the ship-position, namely the long-line position. Provided the technical conditions of the letting-go-line, the heaving-up-line, and seasonal conditions remain the same, the author divided the horizontal forms into three kinds, A, B, and C: Here kind A shows good <b>catch</b> (<b>hooked</b> rate of tuna 5. 26 %), kind B shows bad <b>catch</b> (<b>hooked</b> rate of tuna 1. 30 %), C shows the one which belong neither of these two. As to these two kinds, the difference of the form was investigated with the ascertainment that concerning the shift of the line-end, the shifting distance is small, in case of A, showing the shift of 0. 68 mile per hour, in case of B, 1. 97 mile. Some difference {{can be seen in the}} figures and types of the line. The relation between the line-shift and the fishing conditions was studied oceanographically, with the result that in A kind eddies, convergence is to be observed, which prevent the fish from swimming away in B kind, the tide current showing a fixed direction, the shift of the line is apt to be accelerated. The observation of the horizontal "long-line form" led the author of the following conclusion: 1). Good catch can be expected when the long-line form shows A form, provided that water temperature in 150 m. layer 21 ~ 23 °C. 2). Bad catch is to be expected when it shows B form in this case the water temperature in 150 m. layer is 19 °C. 3). when C form is got, this may be fixed to be belonging to A or B form on the second operation. As reported above, the ascertainment of the relation between the "horizontal tuna-long-line form" and the shifting of the line, enables us to foretell the catch on the spot, giving us much benifit in establishing the fishing schedule here after. 1959 ~ 1962 年の間のセレベス海,マラツア島近海漁場における,多数の縄位置をプロットして,水平的縄の形状並びに縄の流動の状態を観測し,これをA,B,Cと 3 種の型に大別し,この型と海況,漁況との関係を考察した。A型の場合は,漁場付近で暖水帯と冷水帯とが相接し,潮境を構成しているようであり,そのため縄の移動量が少なく,流動方向も区々で,彎曲,交叉が相当あり,鉛直温度分布より躍層が 150 ~ 200 mの間に存在し(150 m層,水温平均 21. 3 °C),釣針深度が躍層以浅の暖水中にあるものと思考され,その結果キハダの好漁をもたらしたものと考察される。また,B型は,漁場付近が冷水帯の流水中に存在し,そのため,縄の移動も大きく,定常方向に流され,彎曲,交叉が全然出現しないものと考える。また,水温,躍層もA型に比し浅く(70 ~ 150 mの間), 150 m層の平均水温は 18 °Cであり,この場合においては,釣針もほぼその付近に存在し,このことが漁況不振の原因となっているように考察される。C型は,出現回数が少なく,持続性なく, 1 ~ 2 日でA,B型に変化するものである。以上のように,水平的縄なりは漁況と密接な関係を有し,その結果水平的縄なりの観察は現場において漁況を予察し,早期海況予報を可能ならしめ,操業計画並びにその後の航海計画樹立に大いに役立つものであると考察する...|$|R
40|$|Elasmobranch {{mortality}} in pelagic longline fisheries poses {{a risk to}} some populations, alters the distribution of abundance between sympatric competitors, changing ecosystem structure, processes and stability. Individual and synergistic effects on elasmobranch catch and survival from pelagic longline gear factors, including methods prescribed to mitigate bycatch of other vulnerable taxa, were determined. Overall relative risk of higher circle vs. J-shaped <b>hook</b> shark <b>catch</b> rates conditioned on potentially informative moderators, from 30 studies, was estimated using an inverse-precision weighted mixed-effects meta-regression modelling approach. Sharks had a 1. 20 times (95 % CI: 1. 03 – 1. 39) significantly higher pooled relative risk of capture on circle hooks, with two significant moderators. The pooled relative risk estimate of ray circle <b>hook</b> <b>catch</b> from 15 studies was not significant (RR =  1. 22, 95 % CI: 0. 89 – 1. 66) with no significant moderators. From a literature review, wire leaders had higher shark catch and haulback mortality than monofilament. Interacting effects of hook, bait and leader affect shark <b>catch</b> rates: <b>hook</b> shape and width and bait type determine hooking position and ability to sever monofilament leaders. Circle <b>hooks</b> increased elasmobranch <b>catch,</b> but reduced haulback mortality and deep hooking relative to J-shaped hooks of the same or narrower width. Using fish vs. squid for bait increased shark <b>catch</b> and deep <b>hooking.</b> Pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea) catch and mortality were lower on wider hooks. Using circle instead of J-shaped hooks and fish instead of squid for bait, while benefitting sea turtles, odontocetes and possibly seabirds, exacerbates elasmobranch catch and injury, therefore warranting fishery-specific assessments to determine relative risks...|$|R

40|$|Preliminary {{studies in}} western North Atlantic pelagic {{longline}} fisheries {{indicate that a}} change in terminal gear from J-style hooks to circle hooks may reduce bycatch mortality. However, such studies have not examined {{the impact of this}} change in the equatorial fishery.

40|$|Reducing shark bycatch and {{depredation}} (i. e., {{damage caused}} by sharks to gear, bait, and desired fish species) in pelagic longline fisheries targeting tunas and swordfish is a priority. Electropositive metals (i. e., a mixture of the lanthanide elements lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, and praseodymium) {{have been shown to}} deter spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias, primarily a coastal species) from attacking bait, presumably because of interactions with the electroreceptive system of this shark. We undertook to determine the possible effectiveness of electropositive metals for reducing the interactions of pelagic sharks with longline gear, using sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus, family Carcharhinidae) as a model species. The presence of electropositive metal deterred feeding in groups of juvenile sandbar sharks and altered the swimming patterns of individuals in the absence of food motivation (these individuals generally avoided approaching electropositive metal closer than 100 cm). The former effect was relatively short-lived however; primarily (we assume) because competition with other individuals increased feeding motivation. In field trials with bottom longline gear, electropositive metal placed within 10 cm of the <b>hooks</b> reduced the <b>catch</b> of sandbar sharks by approximately two thirds, compared to the <b>catch</b> on <b>hooks</b> in the proximity of plastic pieces of similar dimensions.
