25|$|The X-axis of {{the system}} was fed by a time base {{generator}} that pulled the beam {{from left to right}} across the screen. Normally a time base is triggered to start its sweep as soon as the signal from the transmitter is seen, but as noted above, this would not provide the accuracy required for this role. Instead, the time base was set to span the screen at a much faster rate, representing only a portion of the signal's overall flight time. Triggering the time base was accomplished using a very accurate oil-filled potentiometer which exponentially increased the charge in a <b>capacitor</b> <b>bank</b> until it reached a trigger value. A very complex grounding system was needed to ensure the accuracy of the voltages leaving the potentiometer system, as any stray voltages could overwhelm the signal.|$|E
25|$|The main {{amplification}} {{takes place}} in a series of glass amplifiers located {{at one end of the}} beamlines. Before firing, the amplifiers are first optically pumped by a total of 7,680 xenon flash lamps (the PAMs have their own smaller flash lamps as well). The lamps are powered by a <b>capacitor</b> <b>bank</b> which stores a total of 422MJ (117kWh) of electrical energy. When the wavefront passes through them, the amplifiers release some of the light energy stored in them into the beam. To improve the energy transfer the beams are sent though the main amplifier section four times, using an optical switch located in a mirrored cavity. In total these amplifiers boost the original 6J provided by the PAMs to a nominal 4MJ. Given the time scale of a few billionths of a second, the peak UV power delivered to the target is correspondingly very high, 500TW.|$|E

Therefore, the VCBs have to be operated under a harsh condition to ensure {{the reliability of the}} equipment. This study presents a complete comparison study of ordinary and phase-controlled VCBs on switching 10 kV shunt <b>capacitor</b> <b>banks.</b> An analytical analysis for switching 10 kV shunt <b>capacitor</b> <b>banks</b> is presented {{on the basis of a}} reduced circuit with an ungrounded neutral. A phase selection strategy for VCBs to switch 10 kV shunt <b>capacitor</b> <b>banks</b> is proposed. Switching on current waveforms and switching off overvoltage waveforms with, and without, phase selection were measured and discussed by field experiments in a 110 kV substation in Chongqing, China. Results show that the operation of phase-controlled VCBs for 10 kV switching shunt <b>capacitor</b> <b>banks</b> is stable, and phase-controlled VCBs can be used to implement the 10 kV switching on/off shunt <b>capacitor</b> <b>banks</b> to limit the transient overvoltage and overcurrent.

40|$|Power System, {{over many}} years, has {{undergone}} dramatic revolution both in technological {{as well as}} structural aspects. With the ongoing growth of the electric utility industry, including deregulation in many countries; numerous changes are continuously being introduced to a once predictable system. In an attempt to maximally use the transmission system capacities for economic transfers, transmission systems are being pushed closer to their stability and thermal limits, with voltage instability becoming a major limiting factor. Insufficient reactive power support affects the reliable operation of electric power systems leading to voltage collapses as observed by the 2003 National blackout. As a quick corrective action, Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) has aggressively installing <b>Capacitor</b> <b>Banks</b> at its selected 132 kV substations with the intention to improve the voltage profile and the reactive power across the transmission system. The <b>Capacitor</b> <b>Banks</b> are installed in receiving substations, switching substations and substations near an inductive load.

40|$|Abstract: The {{switching}} of high-voltage <b>capacitor</b> <b>banks</b> for {{reactive power}} and voltage control usually produces significant transients. These high amplitude disturbances {{have a tendency}} to damage or reduce the lifespan of capacitor units, thus leading to complete failure of <b>capacitor</b> <b>banks.</b> Pre-insertion resistors or inductors as well as synchronous switching (Point on Wave) methods can be used to mitigate transient phenomenon.
