25|$|From December 2003 to {{the fall}} of 2004, Weezer {{recorded}} {{a large amount of}} material intended for a new album to be released in the spring of 2005 with producer Rick Rubin. The band's early recording efforts became available to the public through the band's website. The demos were a big hit, but none of the songs recorded at this time were included on the finished album. That album, titled Make Believe, was released on May 10, 2005. Despite commercial success, Make Believe got a mixed reception from critics, receiving an average score of 52 on review <b>collator</b> Metacritic. Although some reviews, such as AMG's, compared it favorably to Pinkerton, others, among them Pitchfork's score of 0.4 out of 10, panned the album as predictable and lyrically poor.|$|E
500|$|Russell had {{a program}} with a movable dot by January 1962, and an early {{operational}} game with rotatable spaceships by February. The two spaceships were designed to evoke the curvy spaceship from Buck Rogers stories and the PGM-11 Redstone rocket. That early version also contained a randomly generated background star field, initially added by Russell because a blank background {{made it difficult to}} tell the relative motion of the two spaceships at slow speeds. The programming community in the area, including the Hingham Institute and the TMRC, had developed what was later termed the [...] "hacker ethic", whereby all programs were freely shared and modified by other programmers in a collaborative environment without concern for ownership or copyright, which led to a group effort to elaborate on Russell's initial Spacewar game. Consequently, since the inaccuracy and lack of realism in the star field annoyed TMRC member Peter Samson, he wrote a program based on real star charts that scrolled slowly through the night sky, including every star in a band between 22.5° N and 22.5° S down to the fifth magnitude, displayed at their relative brightness. The program was called [...] "Expensive Planetarium"—referring to the high price of the PDP-1 computer compared to an analog planetarium, as part of the series of [...] "expensive" [...] programs like Expensive Typewriter—and was quickly incorporated into the game in March by Russell, who served as the <b>collator</b> of the primary version of the game.|$|E

Some machines, e.g. <b>collators,</b> could detect which number was higher {{if they were not}} equal. A tabulating machine might compare the account number on successive cards and print a total when a new account number appeared. For the compare function, IBM implemented what would now be called an XOR gate using opposing electromagnets. If neither magnet was energized or both magnets were energized at the same time, the relay armature would not move. If only one magnet was energized, the armature would move and touch one of two contacts placed on either side. The two contacts were wired together internally and connected to an exit hub that indicated an unequal comparison.|$|R
40|$|ReAgents are {{remotely}} executing {{agents that}} customize Internet applications for thin/weak clients. A reAgent {{is essentially a}} "one-shot" mobile agent that acts {{as an extension of}} a client, dynamically launched by the client to run on its behalf at a remote, more advantageous, location. ReAgents simplify the use of mobile agent technology by transparently handling data migration and run-time network communications, and provide a general interface for programmers to more easily implement their application- specific customizing logic. This is made possible by the identification of useful remote behaviors</i& gt;, i. e., common patterns of actions that exploit the ability to process and communicate remotely. Examples of such behaviors are filters, monitors, cachers, and <b>collators.</b> In this dissertation, we identify and analyze a set of useful reAgent behaviors, describe how to program and use reAgents, and show that reAgents provide a scalable, deployable, and effective {{solution to the problem of}} client heterogeneit...|$|R
