50|$|Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is {{a protein}} that binds to {{methylated}} DNA. MeCP2 {{has been found}} to associate most strongly with transcriptionally inactive <b>chromomere</b> domains. MeCP2 binding patterns to <b>chromomere</b> domains are proportional to the density of chromomeric DNA found on a chromosome. The binding of MeCP2 to chromomeric regions represents regions of chromatin that are highly dynamic on the lampbrush chromosome.|$|E

50|$|Chromomeres display {{different}} {{properties and}} behaviours when associated with lampbrush chromosomes. Although found {{all across the}} lampbrush chromosome, they are not organized in a clear pattern along {{as they are in}} normal pachytene chromosomes of meiosis. The two sister chromatids of a lampbrush chromosome separate fully, forming lateral loops that extend from chromomeres, and act as transcription complexes. The lateral loops are areas where the chromosomes are transcriptionally active. The loops define where the <b>chromomere</b> will be positioned. The <b>chromomere</b> is an organization of regions of non-transcribed chromatin. These regions of chromatin that have not been transcribed are located at the ends of the loops that were formed by the sister chromatids of a lampbrush chromosome. Each <b>chromomere</b> can have up to several pairs of loops from lampbrush chromosomes originating from it, as well as micro-loops that cannot be detected with a light microscope.|$|E
50|$|It {{is unknown}} when <b>chromomeres</b> first {{appear on the}} chromosome. <b>Chromomeres</b> can be {{observed}} best when chromosomes are highly condensed. The <b>chromomeres</b> are present during leptotene phase of prophase I during meiosis. During zygotene phase of prophase I, the <b>chromomeres</b> of homologs align {{with each other to}} form homologous rough pairing (homology searching). These <b>chromomeres</b> helps provide a unique identity for each homologous pairs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Chromomeres</b> are {{organized}} in a discontinuous linear pattern along the condensed chromosomes (pachytene chromosomes) during the prophase stage of meiosis. The linear pattern of <b>chromomeres</b> {{is linked to}} the arrangement of genes along the chromosome. <b>Chromomeres</b> contain genes and sometimes clusters of genes within their structure. Aggregates of <b>chromomeres</b> are known as chromonemata.|$|R

50|$|Cohesive {{proteins}} SMC3 and hRAD21(plays {{a role in}} {{sister chromatid}} cohesion) are found within chromomeres at high concentrations, and maintain the proper structure of chromomeres. The protein XCAP-D2 is also present at high concentrations within the <b>chromomere,</b> and acts as a condensin component. High concentrations of tandem repeats of the heterochromatin protein HP1Î² builds up within the <b>chromomere.</b> In regions where loops attach to chromomeres, there is hyperacetylation of histone 4. The extra acetylation loosens chromatin from a condensed form, making it more accessible to proteins involved in transcription.|$|E
50|$|A <b>chromomere,</b> {{also known}} as an idiomere, {{is one of the}} {{serially}} aligned beads or granules of a eukaryotic chromosome, resulting from local coiling of a continuous DNA thread. In areas of chromatin with the absence of transcription, condensing of DNA and protein complexes will result in the formation of chromomeres. It is visible on a chromosome during the prophase of meiosis and mitosis. Giant banded (Polytene) chromosomes resulting from the replication of the chromosomes and the synapsis of homologs without cell division is a process called endomitosis. These chromosomes consist of more than 1000 copies of the same chromatid that are aligned and produce alternating dark and light bands when stained. The dark bands are the <b>chromomere.</b>|$|E
50|$|Chromomeres of lampbrush {{chromosomes}} act as structural units, and are {{not considered}} to be genetic units participating in transcription. The arrangement of a chromosome into chromomeric units happens almost simultaneously with the start of transcription. The loop structures extending from chromomeres are maintained by a high level of transcriptional activity and structural proteins of the chromosome. Chromatin within the <b>chromomere</b> are held in position by a variety of histone modifications and epigenetic markers.|$|E

40|$|The {{constant}} and chromosome-specific band-interband pattern of insect polytene chromosomes has been useful in {{studies on the}} organization of the genetic material in eukaryotes. Early in these studies, it provided cytogeneticists with suitable landmarks for the localization of individual genes. In many investigations a single gene was shown to be confined to one polytene chromosome band, i. e., on the chromatid level, to one particular <b>chromomere</b> (see e. g., Lindsley and Grell, 1968). I t has, however, been more difficult to state whether {{there is more than one}} gene per <b>chromomere.</b> Although this problem is still not settled, recent data indicate that there is only one essential function per <b>chromomere</b> (Judd et al., 1972). The ordered structure of polytene chromosomes has also been of great benefit in analyses of the synthetic activities taking place on the chromo-somes. In studies of DNA replication, Keyl and Palling (1963) and Plaut (1963) found that this process occurs simultaneously at a great number of sites along each chromosome. In fact, it was suggested from their data that each <b>chromomere</b> is a replication unit. The synthesis of RNA is restricted to specific chromosome sections, the so-called puffs, which are more or less expanded regions containing large amounts of RNA (Palling, 1964). Beermann (1964) has argued that a puff originates in a defined chromosome band and is usually also confined to this band. Furthermore, the whole band seems to participate in the puffing process. These observations suggested to Beermann that a <b>chromomere</b> might be some kind of tran-scription unit. In the present investigation we have commenced a characterization of the ranscription products in one defined puff, Balbiani ring 2 in the salivary glands of Chironomus tentans, in order to determine the size and structure of the corre-sponding transcription unit.

The observation that <b>chromomere</b> 3 D 4 is the most probable locus for a chromosomal region which affects cAMP phosphodiesterase activity, and which may contain a structural gene for the enzyme, prompts the hypothesis that the diverse physiological effects caused by nullosomy for 3 D 4 are the result of an aberrant cAMP metabolism...|$|E

40|$|Intranuclear {{electrophoresis}} {{of living}} cells under appropriate conditions causes the chromatin and nucleoli to move rapidly into the anodal {{side of the}} nucleus. In pig kidney cells, chromatin lengths attached to the nuclear envelope are oriented by the current and freed from surrounding non-oriented chromatin. Individual chromatin strands isolated in this way are often long and have not been subjected to the trauma of isolation from the nucleus. This has allowed us to demonstrate oriented lines of up to 8 <b>chromomeres</b> in a strand, linked by fine single fibres. These <b>chromomeres</b> of chromatin have the same linear dimensions as the bands and interbands of polytene chromosomes. A very wide range of morphology of chromatin is revealed- from lines of nucleosomes in open array, to strands uniformly 25 nm thick. Doublet strands and multiple strands- often embedded in darkly staining material- are also seen. All morphological types {{may be seen in}} the same nucleus. Many of the oriented threads appear to be tran-scriptionally active. The variable morphology of these sites and their relation to peripheral heterochromatin is discussed. Histone nucleosomes are present in these apparently tran-scriptionally active regions. The method is useful for investigating the relationships between chromatin and the nuclear envelope.

40|$|The amount, by mass, of poly(A+) mRNA {{present in}} the polyribosomes of third-instar larvae of Drosophila melanogaster, and the {{relative}} contribution of the poly(A+) mRNA to the sequence complexity of total polysomal RNA, has been determined.

The present study shows that this RNA hybridized at saturation with 3. 3 % of the single-copy DNA in the Drosophila genome. After correction for asymmetric transcription and reactability of the DNA, 7. 4 % of the single-copy DNA in the Drosophila genome is represented in larval poly(A+) mRNA.

However, total polysomal RNA hybridizes at saturation to 10. 9 % of the single-copy DNA sequences. After correcting this value for asymmetric transcription and tracer DNA reactability, 24 % of the single-copy DNA in Drosophila is represented in total polysomal RNA.
