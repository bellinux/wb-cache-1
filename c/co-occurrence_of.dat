5|$|The graptolites are colonial organic walled fossils {{which also}} {{occurred}} from the Ordovician to the Devonian; {{only part of}} their life cycle is known {{and it is not}} clear how they reproduced. It has been suggested that the Chitinozoa may represent the pre-sicula stages of graptolites - the period between the colony's sexual reproduction, and the formation of a new colony. This hypothesis appears to be supported by the <b>co-occurrence</b> <b>of</b> graptolite and chitinozoan fossils, whose abundances appear to mirror one another. The similar chemical composition of the fossils has been seized by both sides of the argument. Proponents suggest that the use of the same chemical framework is an indicator that the two may be related. However, this factor means that situations favouring the preservation of one will also tend to preserve the other - and the preparation techniques used to extract the fossils will also favour or disfavour the two groups equally. Therefore, the apparent <b>co-occurrence</b> <b>of</b> the two fossils may merely be an artifact of their similar composition. The hypothesis struggles to explain the continuing abundance of chitinozoans after the middle Devonian, when graptolites became increasingly rare.|$|E
5|$|Crocodylomorphs are {{abundant}} in the Mussentuchit deposits, being represented largely by teeth. The largest known teeth have been referred to the Pholidosauridae; they are broad with rounded bases, {{and some of them}} bear longitudinal ridges. These large crocodilians would have been capable of preying upon at least juvenile Eolambia at the water's edge. The abundance of juvenile Eolambia specimens in the lakeside fossil material supports this hypothesis; larger Eolambia would have been invulnerable to crocodilians. Smaller crocodilian teeth are also present, with two distinct morphotypes: an ovoid form bearing ridges, which has been referred to two different species of Bernissartia; and a compressed, triangular form bearing heavy ornamentation, which has been attributed to the Atoposauridae. However, given the uniform small size of these teeth, and the <b>co-occurrence</b> <b>of</b> these morphotypes in some crocodilians, they may belong to the same species.|$|E

40|$|This poster {{shows the}} {{contribution}} of statistics to a quantitative semantic analysis in a technical corpus (1. 7 million words). A multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) is carried out in order to cluster first-order <b>co-occurrences</b> <b>of</b> a technical node, {{as a way to}} explore the semantic heterogeneity of the node. In distributional semantics, two words are semantically similar if they appear in similar contexts or if they share first-order co-occurrences (Peirsman and Geeraerts, 2009; Ferret, 2010). As a consequence, first-order <b>co-occurrences</b> <b>of</b> a node are semantically similar if they share second-order <b>co-occurrences</b> <b>of</b> the node (Lemaire and Denhi√®re, 2006). By taking into account the association scores (PMI) between relevant first-order and second-order co-occurrences, semantic similarities and dissimilarities between first-order co-occurrences can be determined, as well as proximities and distances on a 2 D-plot. MDS (Kruskal and Wish, 1978; Borg and Groenen, 2005) aims to model similarities and dissimilarities between the observations displayed in the rows of a data matrix (i. e. first-order co-occurrences) with respect to their values in the columns (i. e. second-order co-occurrences) ...|$|R

Facial dysmorphologies such as flattened noses also occur in approximately half of patients.

Although pterosaurs went extinct {{millions of years}} before humans evolved, humans have coexisted with pterosaur fossils for millennia.

25|$|In the United States, it is {{estimated}} that this condition afflicts as many as 200,000 Americans, but fewer than 50,000 are diagnosed. It is as widespread as Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis and more prevalent than cystic fibrosis, but it is less well known. Narcolepsy is often mistaken for depression, epilepsy, or the side effects of medications. It can also be mistaken for poor sleeping habits, recreational drug use, or laziness. Narcolepsy can occur in both men and women at any age, although its symptoms are usually first noticed in teenagers or young adults. There is strong evidence that narcolepsy may run in families; around 10 percent of people diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy have a close relative with this neurological disorder. While narcolepsy symptoms are often confused with depression, there is a link between the two disorders. Research studies have mixed results on <b>co-occurrence</b> <b>of</b> depression in narcolepsy patients - the numbers quoted by different studies are anywhere between 6% and 50%.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} to note that there is a distinction, often confounded in acquisition research, between mapping a label to a specific instance or individual and mapping a label to an entire class of objects. This latter process is sometimes referred to as generalization or rule learning. Research has shown that if input is encoded in terms of perceptually salient dimensions rather than specific details and if patterns in the input indicate that a number of objects are named interchangeably in the same context, a language learner will be much more likely to generalize that name to every instance with the relevant features. This tendency is heavily dependent on the consistency of context clues and the degree to which word contexts overlap in the input. These differences are furthermore linked to the well-known patterns of under and overgeneralization in infant word learning. Research has also shown that the frequency in <b>co-occurrence</b> <b>of</b> referents is tracked as well, which helps create associations and dispel ambiguities in object-referent models.|$|E

Women who have alcohol-use disorders often have a co-occurring psychiatric diagnosis such as major depression, anxiety, panic disorder, bulimia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or borderline personality disorder. Men with alcohol-use disorders more often have a co-occurring diagnosis of narcissistic or antisocial personality disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, impulse disorders or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Women with alcoholism are more likely to experience physical or sexual assault, abuse and domestic violence than women in the general population, which can lead to higher instances of psychiatric disorders and greater dependence on alcohol.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine patterns <b>of</b> <b>co-occurrence</b> among individuals <b>of</b> different Neotropical bat fly species. After establishing patterns <b>of</b> <b>co-occurrence,</b> tests on whether variation in fly morphology was linked to observed patterns <b>of</b> <b>co-occurrence</b> were performed. Co-occurrence patterns were determined using null model analyses, and a predominant pattern of aggregation was detected. To examine the relationship between co-occurrence and morphology, geometric morphometric analyses were performed to compare morphologies of co-occurring individuals of different species. Examination of ratios of species-pairs with significant differences in their morphology relative to speciespairs without significant differences resulted in both insight and more questions. Species segregation may result from morphological similarity between co-occurring streblid species, potentially reflecting historical niche overlap leading to competitive exclusion of one species from infesting the host individual. Aggregation of multiple streblid species however, does not appear to be due to differences in morphology.

2500|$|George Lakoff {{explained}} the inaccuracy of metonymic models, through which people {{jump to conclusions}} without sufficient elaboration, giving rise to prototype effects, in his book Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things. First of all, we commonly consider typical examples as the better examples of a category. For instance, {{in the category of}} fruits, apples and oranges are typical examples. It is common practice that we engage in reasoning by making inferences from typical to non-typical examples. As a matter of fact, an enormous amount of our knowledge about categories of things is organized in terms of typical cases. We constantly draw inferences on the basis of that kind of knowledge. Second, salient examples, which are familiar and memorable, are unconsciously used in our understanding of things. For instance, if one's best friend is a vegetarian and they don't know any others well, they will tend to generalize from their best friend to other vegetarians. This is what Tversky and Kahneman referred to as the [...] "Conjunction fallacy". To understand this notion via Probability theory, think of two mutually unrelated events. The theory assumes that the likelihood of the <b>co-occurrence</b> <b>of</b> the two events is lower than that of the occurrence of either, ignoring the fact that the two events are actually unrelated to one another. To understand this with regards to Lavender linguistics, just because two individuals are both self-identified bisexual males {{does not necessarily mean that}} they must engage in the same linguistic patterns and social styles. The failure to capture this asymmetry between prototypical and non-prototypical cases results in ineffective study of Lavender linguistics. Typical and salient examples are just two kinds of metonymic models. Others include social stereotypes, ideal cases, paragons, generators, and submodels.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Fetal facial {{development}} is essential {{not only for}} postnatal bonding between parents and child, but also theoretically {{for the study of}} the origins of affect. However, how such movements become coordinated is poorly understood. 4 -D ultrasound visualisation allows an objective coding of fetal facial movements. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: Based on research using facial muscle movements to code recognisable facial expressions in adults and adapted for infants, we defined two distinct fetal facial movements, namely "cry-face-gestalt" and "laughter- gestalt," both made up of up to 7 distinct facial movements. In this conceptual study, two healthy fetuses were then scanned at different gestational ages in the second and third trimester. We observed that the number and complexity of simultaneous movements increased with gestational age. Thus, between 24 and 35 weeks the mean number <b>of</b> <b>co-occurrences</b> <b>of</b> 3 or more facial movements increased from 7 % to 69 %. Recognisable facial expressions were also observed to develop. Between 24 and 35 weeks the number <b>of</b> <b>co-occurrences</b> <b>of</b> 3 or more movements making up a "cry-face gestalt" facial movement increased from 0 % to 42 %. Similarly the number <b>of</b> <b>co-occurrences</b> <b>of</b> 3 or more facial movements combining to a "laughter-face gestalt" increased from 0 % to 35 %. These changes over age were all highly significant. SIGNIFICANCE: This research provides the first evidence of developmental progression from individual unrelated facial movements toward fetal facial gestalts. We propose that there is considerable potential of this method for assessing fetal development: Subsequent discrimination of normal and abnormal fetal facial development might identify health problems in utero...|$|R
