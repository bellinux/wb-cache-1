At least five distinct inherited disorders of folate transport and metabolism are presently known, all of which cause systemic folate deficiency. We identified an inherited brain-specific folate transport defect that is caused by mutations in the folate receptor 1 (FOLR 1) gene coding for folate receptor alpha (FRalpha). Three patients carrying FOLR 1 mutations developed progressive movement disturbance, psychomotor decline, and epilepsy and showed severely reduced folate concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated profound hypomyelination, and MR-based in vivo metabolite analysis indicated a combined depletion of white-matter <b>choline</b> <b>and</b> <b>inositol.</b> Retroviral transfection of patient cells with either FRalpha or FRbeta could rescue folate binding. Furthermore, CSF folate concentrations, as well as glial <b>choline</b> <b>and</b> <b>inositol</b> depletion, were restored by folinic acid therapy and preceded clinical improvements.

To demonstrate the potential significance of these plasmenylethanolamines as substrates for the smooth muscle cell phospholipases that are activated during agonist stimulation, aortic rings were prelabeled with [3 H]arachidonic acid and stimulated with angiotensin II. Although the specific activities of the <b>choline</b> <b>and</b> <b>inositol</b> glycerophospholipid pools were similar after the labeling interval, ethanolamine glycerophospholipids had a specific activity of only 20 % of the specific activity of <b>choline</b> <b>and</b> <b>inositol</b> glycerophospholipids. Despite the marked disparity in the specific activities of these three phospholipid classes, angiotensin II stimulation resulted in similar fractional losses (35 - 41 %) of [3 H]arachidonic acid from vascular smooth muscle choline, ethanolamine, and inositol glycerophospholipid classes. Reverse-phase HPLC demonstrated that greater than 60 % of the [3 H]arachidonic acid released from ethanolamine glycerophospholipids after angiotensin II stimulation originated from plasmenylethanolamine molecular species. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the major phospholipid storage depot for arachidonic acid in vascular smooth muscle cells are plasmenylethanolamine molecular species which are important substrates for the phospholipase(s) that are activated during agonist stimulation...|$|E

40|$|A CURRENT {{theory of}} the {{mechanism}} of the hipotropic action of <b>choline</b> <b>and</b> <b>inositol</b> suggests that these substances exert such an effect because they are important constituents of phospholipids. It is not known, however, precisely how the metabolism of phospholipids {{may be related to}} lipotropic activity. The interesting and important experiments of Dr. Zilversmit, discussed in this Symposium may shed some light on this problem. In this paper I will discuss some current work on the enzy-matic synthesis of phospholipids, with the hope that some clue as to the mechanism of the lipo-tropic action of choline may emerge. Three main topics are to be considered: the enzy-matic synthesis of lecithin; the enzymatic syn-thesis of sphingomyehin; and some preliminary experiments on the level of CDP-cholinet in the livers of rats on a choline-deficient diet.

40|$|To {{precisely}} {{define the}} functional {{sequence of the}} CHO 1 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, encoding the regulated membrane-associated enzyme phosphatidylserine synthase (PSS), we subcloned the original 4. 5 -kilobase (kb) CHO 1 clone. In this report a 2. 8 -kb subclone was shown to complement the ethanolamine-choline auxotrophy and to repair the defect in the synthesis of phosphatidylserine, {{both of which are}} characteristic of cho 1 mutants. When this subclone was used as a hybridization probe of Northern and slot blots of RNA from wild-type cells, the abundance of a 1. 2 -kb RNA changed in response to alterations in the levels of the soluble phospholipid precursors inositol and choline. The addition of inositol led to a 40 % repression of the 1. 2 -kb RNA level, while the addition of <b>choline</b> <b>and</b> <b>inositol</b> led to an 85 % repression. Choline alone had little repressive effect. The level of 1. 2 -kb RNA closely paralleled the level of PSS activity found in the same cells as determined by enzyme assays. Disruption of the CHO 1 gene resulted in the simultaneous disappearance of 1. 2 -kb RNA and PSS activity. Cells bearing the ino 2 or ino 4 regulatory mutations, which exhibit constitutively repressed levels of a number of phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes, had constitutively repressed levels of 1. 2 -kb RNA and PSS activity. Another regulatory mutation, opi 1, which causes the constitutive derepression of PSS and other phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes, caused the constitutive derepression of the 1. 2 -kb RNA. When cho 1 mutant cells were transformed with the 2. 8 -kb subclone on a single-copy plasmid, the 1. 2 -kb RNA and PSS activity levels were regulated in a wild-type fashion.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of vasopressin-stimulated PtdIns(4, 5) P 2 and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) hydrolysis {{in relation}} to sustained diacylglycerol (DAG) formation was investigated in A 10 vascular-smooth-muscle cells in culture. Vasopressin stimulated a transient increase in Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 mass formation, which was mirrored by a decrease in PtdIns(4, 5) P 2 mass levels. Vasopressin stimulated sustained accumulation of total [3 H]inositol phosphates ([3 H]IP) {{in the presence of}} Li+; however, this was significantly decreased by adding a vasopressin-receptor antagonist at different times after initial stimulation. Vasopressin-stimulated phospholipase D (PLD) activity was found to be a transient phenomenon lasting approx. 2 min. Experiments involving agonist preincubation with subsequent addition of butanol confirmed that vasopressin-stimulated PLD activity was desensitized. Vasopressin stimulated an increase in formation of choline, but not of phosphocholine, suggesting that PLD was the major catalytic route of PtdCho hydrolysis in this cell line. The roles of <b>choline</b> <b>and</b> <b>inositol</b> phospholipid hydrolysis in the prolonged phase of DAG formation was examined by comparing vasopressin-stimulated changes in DAG levels in the presence of butanol, the protein kinase C inhibitor Ro- 31 - 8220 or a V 1 a-receptor antagonist. Vasopressin-stimulated DAG formation was decreased by 40 - 50 % in the presence of butanol between 1 and 10 min; however, during more prolonged stimulation butanol was without significant effect. In cells pretreated with Ro- 31 - 8220, vasopressin-stimulated DAG formation was decreased by approx. 30 % at 2 min, but was significantly potentiated at later times. This coincided with an enhancement of vasopressin-stimulated [3 H]IP accumulation. In cells exposed to the V 1 a-receptor antagonist 5 min after addition of vasopressin, subsequent DAG formation was significantly decreased, indicating that sustained formation of DAG, like [3 H]IP accumulation, was dependent on continual agonist receptor activation. The results are discussed in terms of different phospholipid-hydrolytic pathways providing DAG generation...|$|E

40|$|Generally, {{the vitamin}} B-complex widely {{contains}} {{both in the}} animal and vegetable kingdom, {{and a lot of}} reports have been published concerning its content, but as to the vitamin B-complex in marine algae, we have had only partial and fragmentary reports in two or three special sorts of it. However, much amounts of marine algae growing in the ocean is not utilized to-day. Accordingly, with the use of scores of marine algae in the southern sea-fronts of Japan as the material, content-measurement was carried out on the following vitamin B complex; namely, thiamine, riboflavin, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, biotin, folic acid, lipoic acid, B_ 12, <b>choline</b> <b>and</b> <b>inositol.</b> The clarified results of the study may be used as some important referential materials in the further utilization of algae as foods and feeding materials for some domestic animals. First, the respective vitamin-content in the specific algae was examined with the following results ascertained; namely, thiamine content was found to be within the range of 0. 27 - 4. 60 γ/g., being abundant in Gracilaria textorii, Gloiopeltis tenax, Chondrus ocellatus: Riboflavin content, 0. 84 - 23. 08 γ/g., being abundant in Porphyra tenera, Gelidium amansii, Chondrus ocellatus, Gloiopeltis tenax: Nicotinic acid content, 3. 51 - 68. 33 γ/g., being abundant in Porphyra tenera, Laurencia okamurai, Gracilaria textorii: Pantothenic acid content, 0. 25 - 12. 21 γ/g., being abundant in Lomentaria catenata, Gracilaria textorii, Laurencia okamurai, Sargassum thunbergii: Folic acid content, 46. 0 - 857. 1 mγ/g., being abundant in Hydroclathrus, clathratus, Gelidium amansii, Laurencia okamurai: Biotin content, 18 - 294 mγ/g., being abundant in Porphyra tenera, Sargassum thunbergii, Hizikia fusiforme, Ulva pertusa: Lipoic acid content, 90 - 985 mγ/g., being abundant in Craciloria textorii, Porphyra tenera, Chondrus ocellatus: B_ 12 content, 3. 3 - 290. 8 mγ/g., being abundant in Porphyra tenera, Chondrococcus japonicus, Gracilaria gigas, Caulerpa racemosa: Choline content, 24 - 4885 γ/g., being abundant in Gelidium amansii, Porphyra tenera: Inositol content, 55 - 1131 γ/g., being abundant in Myelophycus caespitosus, Gracilaria textorii, Caulerpa racemosa, Sargassum thunbergii. Concerning, the class-specific difference of these vitamin-contents in the three classes of Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyceae, in case of Chlorophyceae, the scarcity of the measured samples prevented the fixed conclusion, but in case of the other two classes a considerable difference was generally confirmed. This is to say that in Rhodophyceae such vitamin B-complex as thiamine, riboflavin, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, B_ 12 and choline are more abundant than in Phaeophyceae. While, the biotin content was found to be less in Rhodophyceae than in Phaeophyceae by about one and half. Concerning the contents of other vitamin B-complex, in folic acid and inositol, almost no difference could be observed. Next, after making a comparison of the vitamin content of algae assayed by author with those of vegetables, fruits, meats and fish-meats which have been well known, among the animal and vegetable foods, for their rich vitamin-content, the following results were obtained, namely: Among vitamin B-complex in the marine algae, the contents of inositol, folic acid and thiamine are, in some classes, inferior to those of animal and vegetable foods: while, other vitamin B-complex contents, namely the contents of B_ 12, riboflavin, nicotinic acid, biotin, pantothenic acid, lipoic acid and choline were found to be equal or even superior to those of other foods. In summary, the hitherto neglected role of the marine algae as the vitamin B-complex supplying resources was explored and fixed to be of equal or even more excellent value, as compared with such important foods as vegetables, fruits, and meats. According to the advancement of the researches concerned with the distribution of marine algae and the studies of the utilities for foods accompanied with the advanced technique of putting, dressing, and manufacturing of the marine algae, their vast potentiality as the vitamin B supplying resources would be beyond estimation. By the way, among the vitamin B-complex, as to pantothenic acid, biotin, lipoic acid, <b>choline,</b> <b>and</b> <b>inositol,</b> hitherto, almost nothing was known about their existence, to say, nothing of their content in algae, so, the present author was fortunate enough to {{be the first one to}} have confirmed their existence and fixed their contents. Farther more, it was, also, ascertained that, as was generally seen in animal and vegetable tissue, vitamin B-complex in the marine algae was found to be existing in the conjugated form. And it was after changing this conjugated form into free form that each separate assays was carried out by the present author concerning the specific form. And in folic acid, biotin and B_ 12 there exist many homologues in respective case, so, on separate assays of these homologues was carried out respectively, and the general existence-manner of the vitamin B-complex in marine algae field was here ascertained...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} known for almost 25 years now that {{inclusion}} of intact phospholipids in the diet could improve culture performance of various freshwater and marine fish species. The primary beneficial effect was improved growth in both larvae and early juveniles, but also increased survival rates and decreased incidence of malformation in larvae, and perhaps increased stress resistance. Determination of absolute dietary requirements has been hampered by the use, in different dietary trials, {{of a wide range of}} phospholipid preparations that can vary greatly both in phospholipid content and class composition. Larval studies have been compromised further by the need on many occasions to supply phospholipid through enrichment of live feeds with subsequent re-modelling of the phospholipid and fatty acid compositions. Generally, the levels of phospholipid requirement are around 2 - 4 % of diet for juvenile fish and probably higher in larval fish. The effects were restricted to young fish, as a requirement for dietary phospholipids has not been established for adult fish, although this has been virtually unstudied. As the majority of studies have used crude mixed phospholipid preparations, particularly soybean lecithin, but also other plant phospholipids and egg yolk lecithin, that are enriched in several phospholipids, it has been difficult to elucidate which specific phospholipid classes impart beneficial effects. Based on the few studies where single pure phospholipid species have been used, the rank order for efficacy appears to be phosphatidylcholine > phosphatidylinositol > phosphatidylethanolamine > phosphatidylserine. The efficacy of other phospholipid classes or sphingolipids is not known. The mechanism underpinning the role of the phospholipids in larval and early juvenile fish must also explain their lack of effect in adult fish. The role of phospholipids appears to be independent of fatty acid requirements although the presence of an unsaturated fatty acid at the sn- 2 position may be important. Similarly, the phospholipid requirement is not related to the delivery of other essential dietary components such as the bases <b>choline</b> <b>and</b> <b>inositol.</b> Studies also suggested that the phospholipid effect was not due to generally enhanced emulsification and digestion of lipids. Rather the evidence led to the hypothesis that early developing stages of fish had impaired ability to transport dietary lipids away from the intestine possibly through limitations in lipoprotein synthesis. The current hypothesis is that the enzymic location of the limitation is actually in phospholipid biosynthesis, perhaps the production of the glycerophosphobase backbone and that dietary supplementation with intact phospholipids in larvae and juvenile fish compensated for this. Thus, dietary phospholipids increase the efficiency of transport of dietary fatty acids and lipids from the gut to the rest of the body possibly through enhanced lipoprotein synthesis...|$|E

Many standardised analytical methods for the analysis of nutrients in formula are internationally available. Currently, EU regulation regarding formula (commission directive 2006 / 141 /EC) does not provide any indication on reference methods to be used in official controls for the analysis of vitamins, <b>choline</b> <b>and</b> <b>inositol</b> in formula. Therefore, an overview of the available standardised methods of analysis for the measurement of vitamins, inositol and choline in infant and follow-on formula is provided. 89 standardised analytical methods from both national and international organizations developing standard analytical methods have been collected and their performance characteristics (i. e. analytical technique, target compound, matrixes validated, LOD, LOQ, analytical range, repeatability, reproducibility, accuracy/spike recovery) are described. For most nutrients studied, several standardised analytical methods are available, with a maximum of 12 for vitamin A. Especially for water-soluble vitamins some current standardised methods are more than 25 years old. However, methods of analysis based on more modern analytical technologies have been developed in the recent decades. 11 new official AOAC methods for the analysis of Vitamin A, D, E, B 12, Folic acid and based on more advanced techniques have been adopted as First Action method in 2011 and new AOAC official methods of analysis are expected to be approved in the near future for other nutrients. For several nutrients the overall activity is the sum of the activities of several forms of the compound. However, it is important to notice that the analytical methods available may not always measure the overall activity but only a limited proportion based on specific forms of the compound. In the EU legislation the compound forms that may be used in the manufacturing of formula are listed, however, it does not provide unambiguous specification about the forms of the vitamin to be assessed. Moreover, the minimum and maximum values are provided per energy content, logic from a nutritional point of view. This means that both the uncertainty in the energy calculation and the uncertainty in the measurement of the target nutrient contribute to the total uncertainty in the assessment of the nutrient content when this is provided per energy content. The existence of many different available methods with different performance characteristics and possibly different target forms of the nutrients is identified as a serious gap in the current harmonisation status. In absence of relevant European Union rules, the choice of the best method of analysis for each of the target nutrients in formula should be based on several factors, such as the capacity of the method to assess all the forms of the vitamin that are nutritionally relevant in formula and the analytical performances of the method (i. e. accuracy/spike recovery, reproducibility, lower and upper limit of quantification). As CODEX is the most internationally recognized organization publishing standardised analytical methods, the methods of analysis recommended by CODEX might, although arbitrarily chosen, be taken as guidance for the choice. <br...|$|E

The vitamin B complex comprises a large number of compounds that differ extensively in chemical structure and biological action. They were grouped in a single class because they originally were isolated from the same sources, notably liver and yeast.

However, the specific metabolic pathways that, under physiological conditions, are regulated to produce the DAG required for the membrane trafficking at the Golgi complex are not known. In {{the first part of this}} work we worked on the hypothesis that phospholipid synthesis can control DAG levels at the Golgi complex for the generation of transport carriers at the Golgi complex. To study this, we altered phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylinositol synthesis for a short period of time in CHO cells to evaluate the changes in DAG and its effects in membrane trafficking at the Golgi. We found that cellular DAG rapidly increased when PC synthesis was inhibited at the non-permissive temperature for the rate-limiting step of PC synthesis in CHO-MT 58 cells. DAG also increased when <b>choline</b> <b>and</b> <b>inositol</b> were not supplied. The major phospholipid classes and triacylglycerol remained unaltered for both experimental approaches. The analysis of Golgi ultrastructure and membrane trafficking showed that 1) the accumulation of the budding vesicular profiles induced by propanolol was prevented by inhibition of PC synthesis, 2) the density of KDEL receptor-containing punctated structures at the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi interface correlated with the amount of DAG, and 3) the post-Golgi transport of the yellow fluorescent temperature-sensitive G protein of stomatitis virus and the secretion of a secretory form of HRP were both reduced when DAG was lowered. We confirmed that DAG-consuming reactions of lipid synthesis were present in Golgi-enriched fractions. We conclude that phospholipid synthesis pathways play a significant role to regulate the DAG required in Golgi-dependent membrane trafficking. In the second part of this work we investigate the role of phospholipase Cγ 1 (PLCγ 1), a DAG-producing signalling enzyme, on the membrane traffic at the Golgi complex and in the maintenance of its structure in HeLa cells. We based our work on the effects of the silencing and overexpression of PLCγ 1. We found that PLCγ 1 {{is required}} for post-Golgi trafficking of transmembrane and soluble proteins, that the catalytic activity of PLCγ 1 is necessary to maintain the morphology of the Golgi complex, in particular the trans-Golgi compartments, and that PLCγ 1 contributes to DAG homeostasis at the Golgi, measured by the localization of the DAG-sensing construct C 1 -PKCθ-GFP to the Golgi complex. Finally we show that cargo arrival at the Golgi complex increases the DAG production and that PLCγ 1 {{is required for}} this increase of DAG localized at the Golgi. Our results show for the first time that a physiologic event along the secretory pathway, such as cargo arrival at the Golgi complex, triggers DAG production at this organelle for membrane traffic. We also provide evidence for a pivotal role of PLCγ 1 at the Golgi: PLCγ 1 mediates the DAG production triggered by cargo arrival and {{is required for the}} Golgi structure and membrane traffic at the trans-Golgi compartment. The main conclusions of this work are that: 1 - Metabolic pathways for the synthesis of phospholipids that consume DAG regulate its levels at the Golgi complex. 2. - Phospholipid synthesis controls the levels of DAG needed for both retrograde and anterograde trafficking at the Golgi complex. 3. - Cargo arrival at the Golgi complex promotes DAG production. 4. - PLCγ 1 is involved in the production of DAG triggered by cargo arrival at the Golgi complex. 5. - PLCγ 1 is needed for post-Golgi transport and maintenance of the structure of the Golgi complex...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{analysed}} {{the value}} of metabolomic profiles to predict biochemical progression (BP) risk in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) submitted to radical prostatectomy(RP). They retrospectively analysed 183 PCa cases submitted to RP, using an intact-tissue magnetic resonance spectroscopy(MRS) method. A high-resolution, magic-angle, spinning proton MRS was used to investigate a metabolomic analysis of still-intact prostate tissue. This method allows study of chemical metabolites in their native state and control of intact tissue spectra, preserving the tissue for pathologic analysis. In this study, metabolomic profiles analysed by MRS could differentiate cases of PCa with BP after RP from clinical and pathologic-stage matched cases without BP. The major contributing factors to the observed metabolomic profiles were changes in spermine polyamines,phosphoryl <b>choline,</b> glutamine, <b>inositol,</b> <b>and</b> glutamate. The overall accuracy for predicting BP based on metabolomic profiles ranged from 71 % to 78 %. The suggestion is that PCa metabolic profiles studied at RP with MRS may provide available adjunct parameter to predict the risk of progression after surgery...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{phospholipid}} biosynthetic {{genes of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae are coordinately regulated {{in response to}} <b>inositol</b> <b>and</b> <b>choline.</b> <b>Inositol</b> affects the intracellular levels of phosphatidic acid (PA). Opi 1 p is a repressor of the phospholipid biosynthetic genes and specifically binds PA in the endoplasmic reticulum. In the presence of inositol, PA levels decrease, releasing Opi 1 p into the nucleus where it represses transcription. The opi 1 mutant overproduces <b>and</b> excretes <b>inositol</b> into the growth medium {{in the absence of}} <b>inositol</b> <b>and</b> <b>choline</b> (Opi− phenotype). To better understand the mechanism of Opi 1 p repression, the viable yeast deletion set was screened to identify Opi− mutants. In total, 89 Opi− mutants were identified, of which 7 were previously known to have the Opi− phenotype. The Opi− mutant collection included genes with roles in phospholipid biosynthesis, transcription, protein processing/synthesis, and protein trafficking. Included in this set were all nonessential components of the NuA 4 HAT complex and six proteins in the Rpd 3 p–Sin 3 p HDAC complex. It has previously been shown that defects in phosphatidylcholine synthesis (cho 2 and opi 3) yield the Opi− phenotype because of a buildup of PA. However, in this case the Opi− phenotype is conditional because PA can be shuttled through a salvage pathway (Kennedy pathway) by adding choline to the growth medium. Seven new mutants present in the Opi− collection (fun 26, kex 1, nup 84, tps 1, mrpl 38, mrpl 49, and opi 10 /yol 032 w) were also suppressed by choline, suggesting that these affect PC synthesis. Regulation in response to inositol is also coordinated with the unfolded protein response (UPR). Consistent with this, several Opi− mutants were found to affect the UPR (yhi 9, ede 1, and vps 74) ...|$|R

40|$|Regulation of the {{activity}} of the mitochondrial enzyme phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD) was measured in vitro by using membrane preparations from wild-type and mutant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. PSD specific activity was not affected by carbon source, and on all carbon sources, the highest specific activity was observed in cells entering the stationary phase of growth. However, PSD activity was found to be regulated in response to soluble precursors of phospholipid biosynthesis. PSD specific activity was reduced to about 63 % of the level observed in unsupplemented wild-type cells when the cells were grown in the presence of 75 microM inositol. The presence of 1 mM choline alone had no repressing effect, but the presence of 1 mM <b>choline</b> <b>and</b> 75 microM <b>inositol</b> together led to further repression to a level of about 28 % of the derepressed activity. Regulatory mutations known to affect regulation or expression of genes encoding phospholipid-synthesizing enzymes also affected PSD specific activity. opi 1 mutants, which are constitutive for a number of phospholipid-biosynthetic enzymes, were found to have high, constitutive levels of PSD. Likewise, in ino 2 or ino 4 regulatory mutants, PSD activity was found to be at the fully repressed level regardless of growth condition. Regulation of PSD activity was also affected in several structural-gene mutants under conditions of impaired phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. Together, these data strongly suggest that PSD expression is controlled by the mechanism of general control of phospholipid biosynthesis that regulates many enzymes of phospholipid biosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} whether changes in cellular fatty acid saturation can influence prostacyclin (PGI 2) production by cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. As compared to control cells, those enriched with linoleic acid released 60 [...] 75 % less PGI 2 {{in response to}} thrombin or the calcium ionophore A 23187. A similar but considerably smaller effect was observed when the cells were enriched with oleic or linolenic acid, but no reduction occurred with palmitic or linoelaidic acids. Some reduction in PGI 2 release was noted as early as 1 h after exposure to linoleic acid. When the culture medium was supplemented with linoleic acid, the cell phospholipids contained {{four to five times}} more linoleate and 25 [...] 40 % less arachidonate. These changes were most marked in the <b>choline</b> <b>and</b> serine plus <b>inositol</b> phosphoglyceride fractions. When the fatty acid composition of the cells enriched with linoleic acid was allowed to revert, there was a progressive increase in the capacity of the cells to release PGI 2 in response to thrombin. The increase correlated with a reduction in linoleate content of the cell lipids, but there was no change in arachidonate content. This suggests that linoleic acid may act as an inhibitor of PGI 2 production. The cultured endothelial cells were also able to produce PGI 2 directly from added arachidonic acid. As the arachidonic acid concentration of the medium was raised, PGI 2 formation by the linoleate-enriched cells increased relative to control cells, suggesting that the inhibition produced by linoleic acid may be competitive...|$|R
40|$|Choline is an {{essential}} nutrient and betaine is an osmolyte and methyl donor. Both are important to maintain health including adequate lipid metabolism. Supplementation of dietary <b>choline</b> <b>and</b> betaine increase muscle mass and reduce body fat in animals. However, little data is available regarding the role of dietary <b>choline</b> <b>and</b> betaine on body composition in humans. To investigate the association between dietary <b>choline</b> <b>and</b> betaine intakes with body composition in a large population based cross-sectional study. A total of 3214 subjects from the CODING (Complex Disease in Newfoundland population: Environment and Genetics) study were assessed. Dietary <b>choline</b> <b>and</b> betaine intakes were computed from the Willett Food Frequency questionnaire. Body composition was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry following a 12 -hour fast. Major confounding factors including age, sex, total calorie intake and physical activity level were controlled in all analyses. Significantly inverse correlations were found between dietary <b>choline</b> <b>and</b> betaine intakes, with all obesity measurements: total percent body fat (%BF), percent trunk fat (%TF), percent android fat (%AF), percent gynoid fat (%GF) and anthropometrics: weight, body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio in {{both women and men}} (r range from - 0. 13 to - 0. 47 for <b>choline</b> <b>and</b> - 0. 09 to - 0. 26 for betaine, p< 0. 001 for all).

40|$|Introduction Non-surgical {{sentinel}} node (SN) evaluation offers {{advantages over}} SN removal. Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) of lymph node needle aspirates accurately identifies {{the presence of}} metabolites associated with melanoma micrometastases. Validation of this technique would reduce the morbidity and costs of SN evaluation. Methods Fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNAB) from 70 malignant and 42 benign nodes from patients undergoing node resection for metastatic melanoma were obtained. Proton MRS (8. 5 T) was carried out using standard protocols (4). Four 5 ~tm sections from each node block (3 mm thick) were stained with H&E (2 sections) and for S 100 protein and HMB 45. MR spectra and histopathology were correlated using a statistical classification strategy (SCS) (3). Results Proton MRS of FNAB from benign and metastatic nodes are shown in Figure 1. Resonances include those from lipid (Lip), amino acids, lactate, creatine (Cre), phosphocreatine, <b>choline</b> (Chol) metabolites <b>and</b> <b>inositol.</b> An SCS-based classifier was generated for benign and metastatic nodes. In four random training sets, spectra from 47 metastatic and 28 benign nodes were subjected to SCS. Using five optimally discriminatory spectral regions, metastases was predicted with a sensitivity of 97. 3 %, a specificity of 90. 2 % and an accuracy of 94. 7 %. In independent validation sets (samples not in training sets), including 23 metastatic and 14 benign nodes, the presence of metastases was predicted with a sensitivity of 93. 5 %, a specificity of 87. 5 % and an accuracy of 91. 2 %. The crispness of the data (% samples with a class probability > 75 %) was ~ 88 % for training and validation sets. These data indicate that SN staging of melanoma may be achieved without surgical biopsy and histopathology. Conclusions Pro- ton MRS of FNAB of lymph nodes provides robust, accurate diagnosis of metastatic disease in nodes from melanoma patients...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} by nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy {{the evolution of the}} proton spectral changes in acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. We found an in vivo elevation in the ratio between the peaks assigned to “choline containing compounds” (Cho) and creatine plus phosphocreatine (Cr).

Histological examination revealed inflammation with no evidence of demyelination or neuronal loss. We conclude that the increase in the ratio of Cho:Cr was due to an increase in the concentrations of PC, betaine, <b>and</b> <b>choline</b> in association with inflammation, and not as others have suggested, with demyelination. The reported reduction in NAA may be due to dysfunction of neurones rather than their loss...|$|R
