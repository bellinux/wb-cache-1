40|$|To {{optimize}} the processing properties of <b>ceramic</b> <b>spray</b> dried granules for die pressing applications {{the use of}} defined kinds and combinations of chemical additives is necessary. Within this paper the effect of binder PVA, dispersant NaPA and plasticizer PEG (pure and in combinations) on resulting suspension properties {{as well as on}} mechanical and processing properties of alumina oxide granules is studied. All granules were spray dried at two different solid content levels of the suspensions (40 wt% and 68 wt%) to investigate the influence of the solid content additionally. Even though there was no effect of any additive addition on suspension properties (pH value, solid content, viscosity) at the 40 wt% level, differences concerning viscosity could be measured at 68 wt% level. Varied mechanical granule properties like size distribution, flowability, bulk and tap density as well as single granule strengths were measured depending on the added organics and solid content. The addition of PVA leads to higher granule fracture loads, whereas PEG softens the granules. The addition of a dispersant to the binder PVA leads to a wider fracture load distribution. The addition of dispersant to the plasticizer PEG shows a strength increasing effect...|$|R

A compliant metal fiber strain isolator between a plasma <b>sprayed</b> <b>ceramic</b> coating and a metal substrate improves ceramic durability while allowing thicker coatings for better insulation. Development of strain isolated coatings has concentrated on design and fabrication of coatings and coating evaluation via thermal shock testing. In thermal shock testing, five types of failure are possible: buckling failure im compression on heat up, bimetal type failure, isothermal expansion mismatch failure, mudflat cracking during cool down, and long term fatigue. A primary failure mode for thermally cycled coatings is designated bimetal type failure. Bimetal failure is tensile failure in the ceramic near the ceramic-metal interface. One of the significant benefits of the strain isolator is an insulating layer protecting the metal substrate from heat deformation and thereby preventing bimetal type failure...|$|R

40|$|Electrical {{insulation}} {{is indispensable}} in electrical equipment. Thermally <b>sprayed</b> <b>ceramic</b> coatings are promising materials, offering insulating capabilities {{in areas where}} other materials do not fulfil the requirements. For instance their chemical stability, a high wear resistance {{and an ability to}} withstand high temperatures are significant advantages. This thesis {{is a part of the}} HICC project (Highly Insulating Ceramic Coatings), in which a new class of thermally <b>sprayed</b> <b>ceramic</b> coatings, with significantly improved dielectric properties, will be developed. It contributes to that project in two ways. First by the development of a measurement program to measure the relative permittivity and the loss index in thermally sprayed coatings. Secondly by the analysis of the dielectric properties of three Al 2 O 3 coatings, coated by respectively ethylene high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) spraying, atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) and flexicord spraying. In the theoretical part of this thesis, a thorough literature study regarding general insulator behaviour and thermally <b>sprayed</b> <b>ceramic</b> coatings is performed. In the empirical part, the dielectric properties of the coatings were studied using dielectric spectroscopy measurements. It was found that at temperatures below 100 °C the permittivity and the losses are strongly dependent on the frequency, the temperature and the humidity. Regarding permittivity and dielectric losses, the flexicord sprayed sample showed the most promising results. On the other hand, the plasma sprayed sample showed the highest values for those quantities. These variations are found to be related to differences in microstructure and phase composition, due to the distinctions between the various spraying techniques. At temperatures above 100 °C, an unexpected permanent decrease in relative permittivity and loss index was observed during heat treatments. 	The outcome of this thesis provides a good base for the continuation of the HICC-project. More recommendations for further research and the advice to use stainless steel substrates for future samples, are provided as well...|$|R

40|$|Thermal barrier {{coatings}} (TBCs) {{are widely used}} in gas turbines to reduce the temperature in hot components, which allow a combination of increased part life and improved system performance. Experiments have shown that plasma <b>sprayed</b> <b>ceramic</b> coatings exhibit large tension-compression flow stress asymmetry and rate-dependent deformation behaviors. While in recent {{years there has been}} extensive activity in the analytical and numerical simulation of TBC behaviors, none of the research has focused on the realistic behavior of TBCs mentioned above. Instead, simple elastic and a few elastic-plastic models have been used. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate and implement a realistic viscoplastic model for a plasma <b>sprayed</b> <b>ceramic</b> TBC. Temperature-dependent material constants in the model are found for a specific material using a novel approach based on genetic algorithm. A finite element simulation of a plasma sprayed TBC system represented as a three-layer structure with an interface asperity is presented. The validity of results obtained using simpler and more convenient nonlinear constitutive models for the TBC is assessed by comparison. It is shown that elastic residual stresses at room temperature never become large enough to propagate asperity size scale cracks based on linear elastic fracture mechanics. Failure may need to be described in terms of volumetric damage associated with exceeding the limit stress of the TBC. ...|$|R
