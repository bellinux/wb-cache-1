5|$|<b>Catatonia</b> is {{no longer}} so {{strongly}} associated with schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Catatonia</b> were an {{alternative}} rock band from Wales who gained {{popularity in the}} mid- to late 1990s. The band formed in 1992 after Mark Roberts met Cerys Matthews. The first major lineup featured Dafydd Ieuan on drums, Clancy Pegg on keyboard, Owen Powell on guitar and Paul Jones on bass. They recorded two EPs, For Tinkerbell and Hooked.|$|E
5|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of Alex Shepherd, a Special Forces soldier who returns home from an {{overseas}} tour of duty to find that his father and younger brother are missing, and that his mother has gone into <b>catatonia.</b> Alex begins to search for his brother, leading him to Silent Hill after searching his hometown of Shepherd's Glen.|$|E
50|$|Following <b>Catatonia's</b> {{split on}} 21 September 2001, Owen became a judge on Welsh TV talent show Wawffactor.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{the band}} having not {{releasing}} any new material since their splitting following their last album, Paper Scissors Stone, yet another compilation {{was released in}} 2006, <b>Catatonia's</b> Platinum Collection.|$|R
5|$|On 6October 1971, American soldier Jacob Singer is {{with the}} 1st Air Cavalry Division, {{deployed}} in a village in the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War, when his close-knit unit comes under attack. As many of Jacob’s comrades are killed or wounded, others exhibit abnormal behavior with some suffering <b>catatonia,</b> convulsions and seizures. A terrified Jacob flees into the jungle, only to be bayoneted in the gut by an unseen assailant.|$|E
5|$|Popular {{bands that}} emerged from Wales include the Beatles-nurtured power pop group Badfinger in the 1960s, Man and Budgie in the 1970s and the Alarm in the 1980s. Many groups emerged during the 1990s, led by Manic Street Preachers, {{followed}} {{by the likes of}} the Stereophonics and Feeder; notable during this period were <b>Catatonia,</b> Super Furry Animals, and Gorky's Zygotic Mynci who gained popular success as dual-language artists. Recently successful Welsh bands include Lostprophets, Bullet for My Valentine, Funeral for a Friend and Kids in Glass Houses. The Welsh traditional and folk music scene is in resurgence with performers and bands such as Carreg Lafar, Fernhill, Siân James and the Hennessys.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include observations of specific abnormal movements, {{as well as}} more general observations of the patient's level of activity and arousal, and observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. Abnormal movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may indicate a neurological disorder. A tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of <b>catatonia,</b> such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E
50|$|Several {{tracks were}} re-recorded {{to appear on}} <b>Catatonia's</b> first studio album, Way Beyond Blue. All the tracks were later {{compiled}} onto The Crai-EPs 1993/1994 alongside those from the EP Hooked, released a year after For Tinkerbell.|$|R
50|$|After <b>Catatonia's</b> rise to fame {{with their}} second album International Velvet, and {{subsequent}} success with Equally Cursed And Blessed, the band returned in 2001 with their fourth studio album Paper Scissors Stone. In September 2001, the band officially split.|$|R
5000|$|International Velvet was {{released}} in the United Kingdom on 2 February 1998, following the earlier releases of both [...] "I am the Mob" [...] the previous October and [...] "Mulder and Scully" [...] a few days earlier. It was awarded 3x Platinum status by the British Phonographic Industry on 12 November 1999, meaning that in 22 months it had sold over 900,000 copies. The album was <b>Catatonia's</b> first release in the United States by the Vapor label owned by Neil Young, {{but it did not}} chart and according The Washington Post was [...] "overlooked". It was <b>Catatonia's</b> first album release in the United States. The success of the album was seen as launching the band into the public spotlight.|$|R
25|$|Studies {{indicate}} that 12–17% of {{adolescents and young}} adults with autism satisfy diagnostic criteria for <b>catatonia,</b> which is loss of or hyperactive motor activity. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been used to treat cases of <b>catatonia</b> and related conditions in people with autism. However, no controlled trials have been performed of ECT in autism, and there are serious ethical and legal obstacles to its use.|$|E
25|$|Depression often {{accompanies the}} disease and is best dealt with by {{treating}} the offending symptoms and if needed the judicious use of antidepressants. Some psychotropic drugs are porphyrinogenic, limiting the therapeutic scope. Other psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, depression, mania, hallucinations, delusions, confusion, <b>catatonia,</b> and psychosis may occur.|$|E
25|$|In {{the film}} sequel, , Setsuna and Celestial Being fight the ELS, an alien lifeform {{that has been}} attacking mankind. Setsuna falls into <b>catatonia</b> after {{attempting}} to share his consciousness which, by the burst of information he took, damaged his braincells but manages to recover upon seeing his lost allies in a dream. Piloting the GNT-0000 00 Qan, Setsuna makes contact with ELS, agrees to become humanity's liaison and uses the 00 Qan and quantize to the ELS homeworld. Several years later, Setsuna, having become a part ELS, reunites with Marina.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Catatonia's</b> Greatest Hits is a {{compilation}} of the band's best known songs, mainly the singles, but also included collaborations between Cerys Matthews with Space (on [...] "The Ballad of Tom Jones") and with Tom Jones himself (on [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside").|$|R
5000|$|... "Game On" [...] was {{the fourth}} single release from <b>Catatonia's</b> second studio album, International Velvet. Earlier {{releases}} from the album had included [...] "Mulder and Scully", which became the break-out song for the band, and [...] "Road Rage" [...] which was nominated for best song at the Brit Awards, the Ivor Novello Awards, and won at the Q Awards.|$|R
5|$|A {{music video}} was {{released}} that featured the band performing the track while Mulder and Scully, played by look-alikes, search the concert venue with torches. It was popular {{in both the}} United Kingdom and the United States. The song reached number three in the UK Singles Chart, making it <b>Catatonia's</b> highest UK charting song. It also charted in Ireland, peaking at number 17.|$|R
25|$|Cardiff is {{also well}} known for its musicians, such as Ivor Novello, after whom the Ivor Novello Awards are named. Idloes Owen, founder of the Welsh National Opera, lived in Llandaff, Shirley Bassey is {{familiar}} to many as the singer of three James Bond movie theme tunes, while Charlotte Church is famous as a crossover classical/pop singer. Shakin' Stevens {{was one of the}} top selling male artists in the UK during the 1980s. Tigertailz, a popular glam metal act in the 80s, also hailed from Cardiff. A number of Cardiff-based bands, such as <b>Catatonia</b> and Super Furry Animals were popular during the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), {{formerly}} known as electroshock therapy, and {{often referred to as}} shock treatment, is a psychiatric treatment in which seizures are electrically induced in patients to provide relief from mental disorders. The ECT procedure was first conducted in 1938 and is the only currently used form of shock therapy in psychiatry. ECT is often used with informed consent as a last line of intervention for major depressive disorder, mania, and <b>catatonia.</b> ECT machines have been placed in the Class III category (high risk) by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1976.|$|E
25|$|In {{more modern}} times {{there has been}} a {{thriving}} musical scene. Bands and artists which have gained popularity include acts such as Man, Budgie, and solo artists John Cale & Mary Hopkin in the early 1970s and solo artists Bonnie Tyler and Shakin' Stevens in the 1980s. These were followed by a wave of acts in the 1990s and early 21st century which produced a credible Welsh 'sound' embraced by the public and the media press of Great Britain. Such acts included the Manic Street Preachers, Stereophonics, <b>Catatonia,</b> Super Furry Animals and Gorky's Zygotic Mynci; the latter two bands being notable for bringing Welsh language songs to a British audience.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Catatonia's</b> Platinum Collection is a {{compilation}} {{album of the}} band's songs ranging from 1994 to 2001.Although the band released a Greatest Hits in 2002. Unlike that compilation, the Platinum Collection includes songs from their early EPs released prior to the 1996 album Way Beyond Blue.Platinum Collection contains no previously unreleased tracks, but {{is said to be}} [...] "remastered"; however, there is no discernible difference in comparison with previous releases.|$|R
500|$|... "Mulder and Scully" [...] was {{released}} {{as the second}} single from the band's album International Velvet. Originally, {{it was supposed to}} be the first single, but was delayed due to circumstances beyond the band's control. The song was <b>Catatonia's</b> first single in the United States. [...] "Mulder and Scully" [...] became the group's break-out hit and received a mixed to positive from the music press; many critics felt that, musically, the song was well played, but that the track's pop culture references were out of place.|$|R
5000|$|Ian Hyland gave [...] "Road Rage" [...] {{a rating}} of {{nine out of ten}} in his review for the Sunday Mirror. He said that if [...] "Matthews sounded any more Welsh she'd be a dragon but this is a very {{excellent}} tune in any language." [...] Richard Wallace called the single [...] "magnificent" [...] in an article for the Daily Mirror and praised the [...] "seductive rolling Rs in the chorus". Paul Cole, for the Sunday Mercury, described [...] "Road Rage" [...] in 2002 as the best of <b>Catatonia's</b> greatest hits and [...] "the perfect pop song".|$|R
25|$|Surveys {{of public}} opinion, the {{testimony}} of former patients, legal restrictions {{on the use of}} ECT and disputes as to the efficacy, ethics and adverse effects of ECT within the psychiatric and wider medical community indicate that the use of ECT remains controversial. This is reflected in the January 2011 vote by the FDA's Neurological Devices Advisory Panel to recommend that FDA maintain ECT devices in the Class III device category for high risk devices except for patients suffering from <b>catatonia.</b> This may result in the manufacturers of such devices having to do controlled trials on their safety and efficacy for the first time. In justifying their position, panelists referred to the memory loss associated with ECT and the lack of long-term data.|$|E
25|$|The Cardiff {{music scene}} is {{established}} and wide-ranging—it {{is home to}} the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and Welsh National Opera, has produced several leading acts itself and, as a capital city, has acted as a springboard for numerous Welsh bands to go and become famous both nationally and internationally. Acts who hail from Cardiff include Charlotte Church, Shirley Bassey, Iwan Rheon, the Oppressed, Kids In Glass Houses, Los Campesinos, the Hot Puppies, the School, We're No Heroes, Budgie and Shakin' Stevens. Also, performers such as the Automatic, Manic Street Preachers, Lostprophets, Super Furry Animals, <b>Catatonia</b> and Bullet for My Valentine have links with the city and are associated with the Cardiff music scene. In 2010, Cardiff was named the UK's second 'most musical' city by PRS for Music.|$|E
25|$|In the {{non-traditional}} arena, many Welsh musicians {{have been}} present in popular rock and pop, either as individuals, (e.g. Tom Jones, Shirley Bassey, Dave Edmunds, Shakin' Stevens), individuals in groups (e.g. John Cale of The Velvet Underground, Green Gartside of Scritti Politti, Julian Cope of Teardrop Explodes and Andy Scott of Sweet, Roger Glover of Deep Purple and Rainbow), or as bands formed in Wales (e.g. Amen Corner, The Alarm, Man, Budgie, Badfinger, Tigertailz, Young Marble Giants), but not until the 1990s did Welsh bands begin {{to be seen as}} a particular grouping. Following on from an underground post-punk movement in the 1980s, led by bands like Datblygu and Fflaps, the 1990s saw a considerable flowering of Welsh rock groups (in both Welsh and English languages) such as <b>Catatonia,</b> Manic Street Preachers, Feeder, Stereophonics, Super Furry Animals, The Pooh Sticks, 60ft Dolls and Gorky's Zygotic Mynci.|$|E
5000|$|Late in 1994 {{she joined}} Chris Tennent {{to form an}} indie guitar rock band, Hell's Kitchen, which later became The Superjesus. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, {{described}} McLeod's [...] "captivating voice and melodic rhythm guitar." [...] In May 1996 the group issued their debut four-track extended play, Eight Step Rail, with all the tracks co-written by McLeod with her band mates. Jonathan Lewis of AllMusic noticed McLeod's singing: [...] "Sounding {{like a cross between}} Liz Phair and <b>Catatonia's</b> Cerys Matthews, McLeod's voice was a major drawcard; strong, confident and rarely lapsing into the girlishness that characterized some of The Superjesus' contemporaries." ...|$|R
5|$|Matthews' {{drinking}} {{had long}} {{been reported in the}} tabloids and gossip columns, and she entered rehab in mid-2001 for drinking and smoking. The tour to support Paper Scissors Stone was cancelled, and a month later, the band announced that they were breaking up. Matthews has subsequently released solo albums, while Powell has become a radio presenter and joined the supergroup The Stand to release a charity single. Critics have highlighted the use of metaphors in <b>Catatonia's</b> work, and songs have been compared to poetry by critics. Writing duties had been shared across the band, although had been led by Matthews and Roberts. They disagreed with being labelled an indie band, with Powell saying they had only ever sought to write pop music.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{of those}} bands have had ongoing success, while the general {{popularity}} of Welsh music {{during this period}} led to a resurgence of singers such as Tom Jones with his album Reload. It was his first non-compilation number one album since 1968's Delilah. Meanwhile, Shirley Bassey reached the top 20 once more in the UK Charts with her collaboration with the Propellerheads on the single [...] "History Repeating". They also introduced new acts, such as <b>Catatonia's</b> Owen Powell working with Duffy during her early period. Moving into the 21st century, Bullet For My Valentine were named the Best British Band at the Kerrang! Awards for three years running. Other successful bands from this period include Funeral For A Friend, and Lostprophets.|$|R
25|$|Things {{come to a}} {{head when}} Seishirō loses an eye {{protecting}} Subaru, and Subaru realizes {{that he is in}} love with Seishirō. But the year is over, and Seishirō declares himself the winner of the bet. He breaks Subaru's arm and tortures him, but does not succeed in killing him, as Subaru's grandmother breaks his spell - an action which leaves her crippled. Subaru's shock and heartbreak leave him catatonic. Hokuto, feeling guilty for her promotion of Seishirō, whom she knew to be dangerous, but also believed to be the only one who might touch Subaru's heart, leaves to find Seishirō and confronts him, asking to be killed by him and casting a spell with her death. Subaru, seeing her in a dream, is shocked out of his <b>catatonia</b> by her action. He vows to find Seishirō and take revenge for his sister's death.|$|E
25|$|Gillian {{tells her}} lover, {{reporter}} Ben Caxton, about her experience with Smith. Ben explains that as {{heir to the}} entire exploration party, Smith is extremely wealthy, and following a legal precedent set during the colonisation of the Moon, he could be considered owner of Mars itself. His arrival on Earth has prompted a political power struggle that puts his life in danger. Ben persuades her to bug Smith's room and then publishes stories to bait the government into releasing him. Ben is seized by the government, and Gillian persuades Smith to leave the hospital with her. When government agents catch up with them, Smith makes the agents vanish, then is so shocked by Gillian's terrified reaction that he enters a semblance of <b>catatonia.</b> Gillian, remembering Ben's earlier suggestion, conveys Smith to Jubal Harshaw, a famous author {{who is also a}} physician and a lawyer.|$|E
25|$|The 1970s and 1980s were a less {{influential}} {{time for}} Welsh popular music, with many Welsh acts, such as Bonnie Tyler and Shakin' Stevens, being commercially successful but through mimicking American music styles such as Motown or Rock and Roll. The Welsh language scene saw {{a dip in}} commercial popularity, but a rise in experimentation with acts such as punk band Trwynau Coch leading into a 'New Wave' of music. Bands that followed, like Anhrefn and Datblygu, found support from BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel, {{one of the few}} DJs outside Wales to champion Welsh language music. In the 1990s, the Welsh pop scene flourished, with the emergence of Manic Street Preachers and the Stereophonics, who although not singing in Welsh, brought a sense of Welshness through iconography, lyrics and interviews. The same period saw <b>Catatonia,</b> Super Furry Animals and Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, bilingual bands that were successful enough to bring the Welsh language to an English speaking audience.|$|E

40|$|Eighty six {{consecutively}} admitted unmedicated patients, with {{a current}} duration of illness {{of less than}} two years, who fulfilled ICD- 10 criteria for mood disorder or schizophrenia were assessed for catatonic signs over a three week study period Thirty two {{of them could be}} rated as catatonic, most of them starting to exhibit the signs at the time of admission or a few days thereafter. While the percentage of manic patients showing catatonic signs was comparable to earlier studies, a significant proportion of patients belonging to the Schizophrenic and Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorder group also exhibited these signs. The reasons for obtaining such a high percentage of <b>catatonias</b> are discussed. It is contended that short lasting catatonic signs are a common feature of acute psychiatric admissions and are ignored when viewed within the framework of an affective or psychotic illness...|$|R
500|$|The band {{began work}} on a debut album, {{alongside}} producer Paul Sampson. Ieuan introduced Sampson to Aled Richards, who later replaced him as <b>Catatonia's</b> drummer when Ieuan left to join the Super Furry Animals. The label wanted to market the band, and so at some expense, had [...] photographer Gered Mankowitz conduct a photoshoot with Matthews. She, the band and their management all hated the photos, but the label wanted to use them {{in order not to}} write the cost off as a loss. In order to have some photos, a series of black and white photos of Matthews drinking a bottle of wine while wearing a Pepsi T-shirt were taken by one of the press agency staff. Warner Bros liked the images and authorised their use. The band had a recording session at Sawmills Studios, Cornwall, which saw some disagreements during recording between Matthews and Roberts. Afterwards, Sampson was removed as producer following a row over the arrangement for [...] "Sweet Catatonia".|$|R
