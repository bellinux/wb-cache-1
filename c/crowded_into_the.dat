5|$|After {{returning}} from their travels, the Workmans lectured all over Europe. Fanny lectured in English, German, or French, as the occasion required. At one talk in Lyon, France, 1000 people <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> auditorium and 700 were turned away. In 1905 Fanny became the second woman {{to address the}} Royal Geographical Society. (Isabella Bird Bishop {{had been the first}} in May 1897.) Her talk was mentioned in The Times.|$|E
5|$|In July 1995, {{forces of}} the Army of the Republika Srpska (VRS) {{captured}} the town of Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia, which had been cut off and surrounded {{despite the presence of}} soldiers from the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). Thousands of refugees had <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> town to escape the Serb advance. Following the Serb takeover of Srebrenica, an estimated 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were systematically massacred by Serb forces between 11–15 July and another 25,000–30,000 were subjected to ethnic cleansing. It was the largest act of mass murder in Europe since World War II.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, {{agitation}} grew in Alaska for {{the territory}} {{to become a}} state. Alaskans could not vote in presidential elections and had a territorial legislature with limited powers. Efforts to lobby federal legislators for an Alaska statehood bill met with limited success, so prominent territorial officials decided to draft a state constitution to prove Alaska's readiness to become a state. On November 8, 1955, 55 elected delegates gathered at the University of Alaska to begin drafting a state constitution. The resulting debates lasted {{more than two months}} and caused a sensation in Fairbanks. Debates of the constitutional convention were broadcast on Fairbanks radio, and the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner dedicated daily reports to the progress of the convention. On February 5, 1956, the delegates signed the constitution in front of 1,000 people who <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> University of Alaska gymnasium. The building where deliberations took place was subsequently named Constitution Hall.|$|E

25|$|It was {{the busiest}} {{part of the}} old Port of Singapore, {{handling}} three-quarters of all shipping business during the 1860s. Because the south of the river here resembles the belly of a carp, which according to Chinese belief is where wealth and prosperity lay, many shophouses were built, <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> area.|$|E
25|$|The Russians retreated east. There were {{as many as}} 250,000 Armenians <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> city of Van. These {{people were}} the escapees from the deportations {{established}} by Tehcir Law. Included many who {{broke away from the}} deportation columns as they passed the vicinity on their way to Mosul. Armenians from this region retreated to the Russian frontier.|$|E
25|$|Because he was photographing rapidly {{changing}} events during the celebrations, Eisenstaedt {{did not have}} an opportunity to get the names and details. The photograph does not clearly show the face of either person involved, and numerous people have claimed to be the subjects. The photograph was shot just south of 45th Street looking north from a location where Broadway and Seventh Avenue converge. Soon afterward, throngs of people <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> square and it became a sea of people.|$|E

25|$|Throughout June and July, as Turkish and Russian forces battled to {{the north}} of the Van region, {{thousands}} of Armenians from Mush and other neighbouring provinces started flooding into the city of Van. There were as many as 250,000 Armenians <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> city. This included people who broke away from the deportation columns as they passed the vicinity of the province on their way to Mosul. Before the crisis, the city of Van had housed and fed no more than 50,000 people.|$|E
25|$|During the Great Depression, {{many of the}} Masons {{lost their}} savings, and the Masons were forced to rent the ground floor to a social club that {{installed}} an illegal slot machine. After World War II, the Masons resumed full use of the structure, and in 1948, more than 300 people <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Masonic Temple to attend {{a memorial service for}} D. W.

25|$|The second relief attempt of the Siege of Mantua ended {{badly for}} Austria when General Napoleon Bonaparte routed Feldmarschall Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser's army at the Battle of Bassano. In the sequel, Wurmser marched for Mantua, evading French {{attempts}} {{to cut him}} off. He reached there with 16,000 soldiers on 12 September 1796, but was defeated and driven into the fortress by the French on the 15th. With Wurmser's Austrians and the original garrison <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> encircled city, disease and hunger began exacting a serious toll on the garrison.|$|E

25|$|On the {{day before}} Ash Wednesday, festivities begin at 10 {{in the morning with}} music and dance as well as fireworks. These wind through the streets {{on their way to the}} main square. The party {{continues}} in the square with music and food and rides and other attractions. However, the real festivities begin at sundown and continue until the stroke of midnight of Wednesday. Throughout the day and night, Chinelos can be seen dancing through the crowds. At its height, there are about 15,000 people <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> town center.|$|E
25|$|On 13 February, Bennett {{and other}} senior Australian {{officers}} advised Percival to surrender, {{in the interests}} of minimising civilian casualties. Percival refused but unsuccessfully sought authority to surrender from his superiors. The following day the remaining British Commonwealth units battled on. The Australians established a defensive perimeter to the north-west of the city centre around Tanglin Barracks, while preparations were made to mount a final stand. Meanwhile, civilian casualties mounted as civilians <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> area now held by the Allies and bombing and artillery attacks intensified. Civilian authorities began to fear that the water supply would soon give out. Japanese troops killed 200 staff and patients after they captured Alexandra Barracks Hospital.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} {{stone was}} laid at 1.30pm on Monday 26 July 1869. A large crowd {{gathered at the}} site, so that the area reserved for the ceremony had to be roped off. Countess Augusta of Dartmouth and Rev. Richard Collins, vicar of Kirkburton, led the procession, followed by the Earl of Dartmouth and the Rev. R.B. Thompson who {{was to be the}} first incumbent of Thurstonland Church. Then came more than 20 clergymen, churchwardens and a dozen or more VIPs who all <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> enclosure. Among the VIPs were Lieutenant-Colonel Bradbury JP, William Brooke JP, Captain Legge, Adjutant Legge, Major Brooke, George Wood Jenkinson (1838–1898) the Thurstonland churchwarden, and W.S. Barber the architect. In the newspaper reports, James Mallinson is not mentioned as being present. The choir, the band, the Sunday School children and the spectators arranged themselves outside the ropes.|$|E

25|$|The Stamp Act Congress met in New York in October 1765 as the Sons of Liberty {{organized}} in the city, skirmishing {{over the next ten}} years with British troops stationed there. The Battle of Long Island, the largest battle of the American Revolutionary War, was fought in August 1776 within the modern-day borough of Brooklyn. After the battle, in which the Americans were defeated, the British made the city their military and political base of operations in North America. The city was a haven for Loyalist refugees and escaped slaves who joined the British lines for freedom newly promised by the Crown for all fighters. As many as 10,000 escaped slaves <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> city during the British occupation. When the British forces evacuated at the close of the war in 1783, they transported 3,000 freedmen for resettlement in Nova Scotia. They resettled other freedmen in England and the Caribbean.|$|E
25|$|City {{organizers}} {{had set up}} a two-block long fan zone on six-lane Georgia Street {{near the}} Rogers Arena. Two big screen TVs were set up for fans to watch the game. Temporary fences and gates were set up to provide checkpoints where police could control access to the area and check for alcohol (which police generally poured out when found). Following recommendations stemming from the 1994 riot, all liquor stores in the area were closed earlier in the day. Crowds had been generally well-behaved in the fan zone for the previous six games, with roughly 70,000 attending each event. Similar though smaller events had been very successful during the 2010 Winter Olympics. For the final game, an estimated 100,000 people <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> area, and people found ways to enter the zone without being checked for alcohol. Planned corridors to allow movement of emergency vehicles became impassable.|$|E
25|$|Those {{sentenced to}} death before c. 1800 at the castle were usually taken to Lancaster Moor, near where the Ashton Memorial now stands, to be hanged. After the Georgian remodelling of the castle, it was {{decided it would be}} more {{convenient}} to perform executions nearer the castle. The spot chosen became known as Hanging Corner. Lancaster has a reputation as the court that sentenced more people to death than any other in England. This is partly because until 1835 Lancaster Castle was the only Assize Court in the entire county and covered rapidly growing industrial centres including Manchester and Liverpool. Between 1782 and 1865, around 265people were hanged at Lancaster; the executions were frequently attended by thousands of people <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> churchyard. The Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868 ended public executions, requiring that criminals be put to death in private, after which 6 executions were performed inside the castle, at first from the Chapel steps (5), then later (1) in a purpose-built execution shed, on the inside wall of Hanging Corner. This shed remained until the mid-20th Century, allegedly still containing the Gallows. The last execution (of Thomas Rawcliffe, wife-murderer) at Lancaster took place in 1910. The prison closed in 1916 due to a national {{decrease in the number of}} prisoners, although for part of the First World War it held German civilians and prisoners of war.|$|E

500|$|On 5 July George Thomas held {{a dinner}} in Denning's honour at the Speaker's House. Attending were Margaret Thatcher, Robert Runcie, Lord Hailsham, Geoffrey Howe, Lord Lane, William Whitelaw, Michael Havers and Christopher Leaver.

500|$|The {{leaders of}} the colony {{decided to leave the}} smaller Speedwell behind after {{numerous}} delays caused by leaking, which had caused them to return to port twice. The Standishes and most of the Speedwell passengers <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Mayflower, and the Speedwell went on to London to be resold, now with only a few passengers. (She subsequently made numerous successful journeys as a cargo vessel for her new owners, but never sailed to the New World.) The Mayflower passengers, meanwhile, sold some valuable supplies such as butter to pay the mounting port fees, and finally departed Plymouth, England on September 6, 1620, bound for {{the northern part of the}} Virginia Colony.|$|E
500|$|Joseph {{arrived in}} New York on July 7, 1888, and later that month preached his inaugural Sabbath sermon at Beth Hamedrash Hagodol. The speech {{attracted}} a huge crowd, with over 1,500 men <b>crowded</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sanctuary, and thousands more outside. The police {{had to call}} extra reinforcements to control the throng, and to escort Joseph into the synagogue. Though he had been chosen, in part, for his [...] "fabulous skills as an orator", his speaking style and sermons, which had been so beloved in Europe, did not impress New York audiences. According to Abraham Cahan, [...] "ome of {{the very people who}} drank in his words thirstily in Vilna left the synagogue {{in the middle of his}} sermon here." ...|$|E
