On 18-19 January 1992, Győrkös and six other members were arrested after perquisitions which found and confiscated large arsenal of Soviet-era firearms, training grenades, gas pistols and other light weaponry. Győrkös was charged with inciting hatred against minorities (Jews and Romani people) and foreigners, and the illegal possession of firearms. He was sentenced to a one-year suspended imprisonment in February 1993.

The measures taken by the social services to help the battered women consisted mainly of economic support and psychotherapy. The cooperation between the medical and social services and the police in cases of wife battering was very limited or non-existent. It is concluded that support given to battered women by the formal sources of aid is insufficient. The documentation of the cases is poor, there is a lack of practical measures and the cooperation between the authorities is limited. This study indicates that the social and medical services underestimate the importance of informal help sources like women's groups or shelters which often are the most valued resources by the battered women themselves.

40|$|<b>Cooperation</b> <b>between</b> <b>authorities</b> is {{of great}} {{importance}} for effective crisis management. A new crisis management system was introduced in Sweden in 2002 to enhance the ability of public authorities to manage accidents and extraordinary events. It expects authorities to cooperate with each other both before and while dealing with such situations. An important aspect of this cooperation is the exchange of information, which is hampered when authorities are obliged to observe secrecy rules even if this limits their ability to manage accidents and extraordinary events. It may be said, therefore, that the legislation governing the exchange of information by authorities, chiefly the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009 : 400), is essentially at variance with the rules that require cooperation. The thesis analyses legal requirements on authorities to cooperate and exchange information when dealing with accidents and extraordinary events and how these requirements relate to secrecy rules. The study does not merely examine the legal requirements placed on authorities to cooperate and exchange information and to observe secrecy rules when dealing with accidents and extraordinary events; it also undertakes a critical analysis of the current legislation, {{with the aim of}} identifying deficiencies and ambiguities, taking as its criteria that good legislation should be clear, coherent and well-balanced.

40|$|The {{research}} {{aim is to}} analyze the perspectives of the modelling of the Latvian local authorities and communities partnership at the context of sustainable urban development. In order to achieve the set aim the following research objectives were defined: to analyze the perspectives of the partnership development <b>between</b> the local <b>authority</b> and community at the context of sustainable urban development; to study the opportunities of the mutual <b>cooperation</b> <b>between</b> local <b>authority</b> and community; to evaluate links between the modelling of the partnership <b>between</b> local <b>authority</b> and community {{and the concept of}} sustainable development; to make conclusions and give recommendations for the promotion of the partnership <b>between</b> local <b>authority</b> and community in Latvia at the context of sustainable urban development. This paper focuses on the study of the opportunities of the modelling of the partnership <b>between</b> local <b>authority</b> and community which is an important competitive advantage of the national social, economic and spatial development at the context of sustainable development. The hypothesis of the research is local authority and community are creators of the economic, social, environmental, recreational values. The close partnership <b>between</b> local <b>authority</b> and community is vitally important for the evaluation of the distinction of the different regions of Latvia and their potential contribution to the society development {{as well as to the}} prosperity of the Republic of Latvia. Analyzing the processes of the promotion of the partnership development <b>between</b> local <b>authority</b> and community in Latvia, it is necessary to note, that very often political decisions about support for <b>cooperation</b> <b>between</b> local <b>authority</b> and community are contrary to the coherent development strategies and action plans. Lack of initiative of the state and local government and lack of the support of the scientific researches in area of modelling of the partnership <b>between</b> local <b>authority</b> and community very often prevent practical possibilities to realize the best experience of <b>cooperation</b> <b>between</b> local <b>authority</b> and community. This means that sustainable urban development is impossible without <b>cooperation</b> <b>between</b> local <b>authority</b> and society. For this reason local authorities must to aware their strengths and weaknesses, to assess the current situation and to create strong but also on understanding oriented relationship and discussions with the various groups of community as well as to involve them in active cooperation. It is important to remember that sustainable urban development is not only administrative regulatory provisions and limitations but also communication with local inhabitants about the place of their residence – urban development problems, tendencies and priorities. The research is based on the three methods: 1) logically constructive method – logical interpretation of the already published by the other author's data on the modelling of the partnership <b>between</b> local <b>authorities</b> and communities; 2) monographic method – interpretation of the data based on proven knowledge about the economic, social, environmental aspects of the partnership <b>between</b> local <b>authorities</b> and communities; 3) document analysis method – study and evaluation of the normative acts and scientific researches on interaction and partnership development <b>between</b> local <b>authorities</b> and communities at the context of the aim of this research. The results of this study showed that it is crucial to develop and to promote partnership <b>between</b> local <b>authorities</b> and communities on the basis of mutual benefit principle. It is important that urban areas become or remain attractive, both to residents and businesses. Their capacity to innovate and create new economic opportunities is a prerequisite to ensuring that these regions do not lose out in global competition...|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} pharmaceutical {{pricing and}} reimbursement policies in European countries {{with regard to}} their ability to ensure affordable access to medicines. A frequently applied pricing policy is external price referencing. While it provides some benchmark for policy-makers and {{has been shown to be}} able to generate savings, it may also contribute to delay in product launch in countries where medicine prices are low. Value-based pricing has been proposed as a policy that promotes access while rewarding useful innovation; however, implementing it has proven quite challenging. For high-priced medicines, managed-entry agreements are increasingly used. These agreements allow policy-makers to manage uncertainty and obtain lower prices. They can also facilitate earlier market access in case of limited evidence about added therapeutic value of the medicine. However, these agreements raise transparency concerns due to the confidentiality clause. Tendering as used in the hospital and offpatent outpatient sectors has been proven to reduce medicine prices but it requires a robust framework and appropriate design with clear strategic goals in order to prevent shortages. These pricing and reimbursement policies are supplemented by the widespread use of Health Technology Assessment to inform decision-making, and by strategies to improve the uptake of generics, and also biosimilars. While European countries have been implementing a set of policy options, there is a lack of thorough impact assessments of several pricing and reimbursement policies on affordable access. Increased <b>cooperation</b> <b>between</b> <b>authorities,</b> experience sharing and improving transparency on price information, including the disclosure of confidential discounts, are opportunities to address current challenges...|$|E

A qualitative approach has been applied and semi-structured interviews used. The sample consisted of five social workers in Örebro County involved in Barnahus’s cooperation. The result shows that the interaction works rather well considering the activity is relative new and the social workers are quite satisfied. The opportunities following cooperation, according to the social workers, are a faster process, the exchange of information, and different perspectives on the child's situation. Restrictions are, for example, the extended time the police’s process takes and the secrecy legislation.   The result indicates that the social workers believes that the children's rights are applied, some articles more than others.

Such a form may be represented by the sanitary and epidemiological audit as an independent objective assessment of reputable third parties. The audit is intended to check the compliance with the mandatory requirements of the economic entities, performing economic or other activities. The sanitary-epidemiological audit may be associated with a system of certification for compliance with sanitary requirements and may assume the documented confirmation of the compliance issued by the authorized persons. The sanitary-epidemiological audit and the compliance certification to mandatory sanitary requirements can make an alternative to the planned supervision activities on facilities attributed to the category of low and moderate risk of harm to human health. The Russian sanitary legislation does not recognize the sanitary-epidemiological audit as a form of conformity assessment. The analysis of the international experience shows {{that it is necessary to}} consolidate the general rules and regulations of the sanitary-epidemiological audit at the legislative level and to develop a set of sublegislative documents in order to implement these norms. The crucial is a creation of the national system capable to regulate the registration and functioning of the organization having a right to conduct the audit activities in the field of hygienic safety. It is reasonable to develop the regulation on the list-register of auditors and to create a special training system for the auditors, who possess the methodology for health risk assessment.
