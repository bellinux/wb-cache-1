Virtual Private Caches (VPCs) are an important element of VPMs, and VPC hardware consists of two major components: the VPC Arbiters, which manage shared resource bandwidth, and the VPC <b>Capacity</b> <b>Manager.</b> Both the VPC Arbiter and VPC <b>Capacity</b> <b>Manager</b> provide minimum service guarantees that, when combined, achieve QoS within a L 2 cache. Simulation-based evaluation shows that conventional cache management policies allow concurrently executing threads to affect each other significantly. In contrast, VPCs meet their QoS performance objec-tives and have a fairness policy for distributing excess resources that is amenable to general-purpose multi-threaded systems. On a CMP running heterogeneous workloads, VPCs improve throughput by eliminating negative interference, i. e., VPCs improve average performance by 14 % (harmonic mean of normalized IPCs) and by 25 % (minimum normalized IPC). 1...|$|E
40|$|Resource pools are {{computing}} {{environments that}} offer virtualized access to shared resources. When used effectively they can align {{the use of}} capacity with business needs (flexibility), lower infrastructure costs (via resource sharing), and lower operating costs (via automation). This paper describes the Quartermaster <b>capacity</b> <b>manager</b> service for managing such pools. It implements a trace-based technique that models workload (e. g., application) resource demands, their corresponding resource allocations, and resource access quality of service. The primary advantages of the technique are its accuracy, generality, support for resource access qualities of service, and optimizing search method. We pose general capacity management questions for resource pools and explain how the <b>capacity</b> <b>manager</b> helps to address them in an automated manner. A case study demonstrates and validates the method on empirical data from an enterprise application. We show that the technique exploits much of the resource savings to be achieved from resource sharing and is significantly more accurate at estimating per-server required capacity than a benchmark method used in practice to manage a resource pool. Finally, we explain how the problems relate to other practices regarding enterprise capacity management and software performance engineering. 1...|$|E

Virtual Private Caches (VPCs) are an important element of VPMs. VPC hardware consists of two major components: the VPC Arbiter, which manages shared cache bandwidth, and the VPC <b>Capacity</b> <b>Manager,</b> which manages the cache storage. Both the VPC Arbiter and VPC <b>Capacity</b> <b>Manager</b> provide minimum service guarantees that, when combined, achieve QoS for the cache subsystem. Simulation-based evaluation shows that conventional cache bandwidth management policies allow concurrently executing threads to affect each other significantly in an uncontrollable manner. The evaluation targets cache bandwidth because the effects of cache capacity sharing have been studied elsewhere. In contrast with the conventional policies, the VPC Arbiter meets its QoS performance objectives on all workloads studied and over a range of allocated bandwidth levels. The VPC Arbiter’s fairness policy, which distributes leftover bandwidth, mitigates the effects of cache preemption latencies, thus ensuring threads a highdegree of performance isolation. Furthermore, the VPC Arbiter eliminates negative bandwidth interference which can improve aggregate throughput and resource utilization...|$|E
30|$|Apart {{from these}} {{burstiness}} agnostic approaches, we also consider an approach used by practitioners {{that is based}} on setting a resource utilization threshold, e.g., a CPU utilization target, instead of SLOs based on response times. An advantage of this technique is its simplicity. The technique does not require a performance model to estimate application response times. An example of a utilization-based technique is the Quartermaster <b>capacity</b> <b>manager</b> service proposed by Rolia et al. [19]. Quartermaster allows resource utilization thresholds to be set as an indirect mechanism for achieving desired application response times.|$|E

Unlearning is emerging as an important element of change and innovation in organisations.

Two key scholars in this field have proposed models of unlearning however, little empirical research exists to further understanding of unlearning and the factors that may impact upon it. This paper reports on case study research aimed at further developing the concept of unlearning. A process model has emerged from the data that highlights inhibitors and enablers of the unlearning process. In an applied sense, the model provides managers with identifiable enablers and inhibitors of individual unlearning; issues which must then be addressed in change strategies at the organisational level...|$|R
40|$|Purpose This paper {{analyses}} {{the relationships}} between congenital learning and realized absorptive capacity and tries to identify whether absorptive capacity impacts on international organizational performance in today’s global business environment. Design/methodology/approach The research model and hypothesized relationships are empirically tested using the structural equation modelling approach, validated by factor analysis of 128 SMEs in the UK telecommunications sector. Findings Our findings suggest that, {{in order to achieve}} higher levels of realized absorptive <b>capacity,</b> <b>managers</b> need to create and support a congenital learning process. Furthermore, if an SME does not achieve the required realized absorptive capacity then international organizational performance is likely to deteriorate. Originality/value SMEs need to provide and support a learning process, which is customised and based on three sub-processes: 1) the framework for transferring knowledge; 2) the framework for transforming knowledge; and 3), an open organizational context. Based on these results, transferring and transforming are important sub-processes but are not sufficient for updating congenital knowledge...|$|R

40|$|We present CCM (Cloud <b>Capacity</b> <b>Manager)</b> – a {{prototype}} system, and, methods for dynamically multiplexing the compute capacity of cloud datacenters at scales {{of thousands of}} machines, for diverse workloads with variable demands. This enables mitigation of resource consumption hotspots and handling unanticipated demand surges, leading to improved resource availability for applications and better datacenter utilization levels. Extending prior studies primarily concerned with accurate capacity allocation and ensuring acceptable application performance, CCM also focuses on the tradeoffs due to two unavoidable issues in large scale commodity datacenters: (i) maintaining low operational overhead, and (ii) coping with the increased incidences of management operation failures. CCM is implemented in an industry-strength cloud infrastructure built {{on top of the}} VMware vSphere virtualization platform and is currently deployed in a 700 physical host datacenter. Its experimental evaluation uses production workload traces and a suite of representative cloud applications to generate dynamic scenarios. Results indicate that the pragmatic cloud-wide nature of CCM provides up to 25 % more resources for workloads and improves datacenter utilization by up to 20 %, compared to the alternative approach of multiplexing capacity within multiple smaller datacenter partitions. 1...|$|E

In agricultural regions with a predominance of private land, biodiversity outcomes will depend on the adaptive capacity of individual land managers, as well as their willingness to engage with conservation programs and actions. Understanding adaptive capacity of landholders is critical for assessing future prospects for biodiversity conservation in privately owned agricultural landscapes globally, given projected climate change. This paper is the first to develop and apply a set of statistical methods (correlation and bionomial regression analyses) for combining social data on land <b>manager</b> adaptive <b>capacity</b> and factors associated with conservation program participation with biophysical data describing the current and projected-future distribution of climate suitable for vegetation communities.

Unlearning is emerging as an important element of change and innovation in organisations. As the pace of change continues to increase, it is clear than normal processes of forgetting and transition may not be sufficient. Two key scholars in this area have proposed models of unlearning. Hedberg (1981) suggested that unlearning happens much like overwriting; new knowledge replaces or overwrites the old. Klein (1989) however proposed the parenthetic model, suggesting that the old knowledge remains (in parenthesis as it were), and may emerge in contexts where the new knowledge does not appear to apply. This paper reports on case study research aimed at further developing the concept of unlearning {{at the level of the}} individual to inform the consideration of unlearning at the organisational level. A process model has emerged from the data that highlights inhibitors and enablers of the unlearning process as identified by participants in the study.
