The paper also analyzes the following issues and challenges: a) assessing the impact of interventions conducted in communities including the difficulty of integrating <b>community</b> <b>initiatives</b> within the national responses; b) sustaining <b>community</b> <b>initiatives</b> where strategies and funding are uncertain, and where initiatives depend on volunteers; c) cost effectiveness; and d) ensuring adequate representation of marginalized groups. Finally, the paper presents issues and trends for external assistance to <b>community</b> <b>initiatives.</b> This includes examining the role of <b>community</b> <b>initiatives</b> within national strategies, donor strategies for assisting communities, decentralization and <b>community</b> HIV/AIDS <b>initiatives,</b> performance or output-based grants, and the nature and use of impact evaluations...|$|R

This process works as a double impact by not only providing housing but also giving homeless people employment income and work experience. One example of this type of initiative is the nonprofit organization Living Solutions, which is located in downtown San Diego, CA. This <b>community</b> <b>initiative</b> provides the homeless population with a source of housing as well as giving them jobs building affordable homes. The initiative also builds community empowerment by asking formerly homeless residents to help to maintain and repair these homes. Residents are responsible for all household duties, including menu planning, budgeting, shopping, cooking, cleaning, yard work, and home maintenance. The environment of responsibility over a living space fosters a sense of ownership as well as involvement {{in all parts of the}} decision-making process.|$|E

In 1993, however, Powell claimed that his policy could have worked. He claimed the criminally insane should have never been {{released}} and that the problem was one of funding. He said the new way of caring for the mentally ill would cost more, not less, than the old way because community care was decentralised and intimate as well as being [...] "more human". His successors had not, Powell claimed, provided the money for local authorities to spend on mental health care and therefore institutional care had been neglected whilst {{at the same time there}} was not any investment in community care.|$|E
