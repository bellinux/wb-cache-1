25|$|Labor {{unions in}} the United States are representatives {{of workers in}} many {{industries}} recognized under US labor law. Their activity today centers on collective bargaining over wages, benefits, and working conditions for their membership, and on representing their members in disputes with management over violations of <b>contract</b> <b>provisions.</b> Larger unions also typically engage in lobbying activities and electioneering {{at the state and}} federal level.|$|E
25|$|In October, Thruway {{insignia}} {{and signs}} indicating its maintenance responsibilities {{were removed from}} the roadway, and authority employees assigned to the road began transferring to jobs elsewhere, after the union waived several <b>contract</b> <b>provisions</b> to smooth the transfer. New York State Troopers who patrolled the road were reassigned from Thruway-based Troop T to Troop F in Orange County and Troop K in Dutchess and Putnam Counties, which cover the west and east sides of the Hudson respectively. At the DOT's request, the two state police substations in Wallkill and East Fishkill remained open.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} nominal <b>contracting</b> <b>provisions</b> on employment determination in union contracts. In most contracts, the nominal wage rate is wholly or partially predetermined. Real wage rates therefore contain unanticipated components that reflect unexpected price changes {{and the degree of}} indexation. The empirical analysis, based on a large sample of indexed and nonindexed contracts, suggests that unexpected real wage changes are associated with systematic employment responses in the opposite direction. The author concludes that nominal <b>contracting</b> <b>provisions</b> play a potentially important role in the cyclical properties and persistence of employment movements in the union sector.

25|$|The {{copyright}} law of 1993 also contained, {{similar to other}} European {{copyright law}}s, <b>contract</b> <b>provisions</b> regulating the transfer of copyrights. Contracts {{have to be in}} writing, except for contracts about the use of a work in a periodical, which may be concluded orally. Shrink-wrap licenses for software are allowed. The law distinguishes between exclusive and non-exclusive transfers of rights. Only patrimonial rights can be transferred, but not moral rights, the resale right, or the right to remuneration for home-copying. In any contract, only those rights explicitly mentioned are transferred, and a transfer is only considered exclusive if the contract explicitly says so. Any contract must specify for which uses the rights on a work are transferred, for which term this transfer is valid, for which territory it applies, and it must define the remuneration the author receives. If no term is specified, an author may revoke the contract after five years with six months notice. If the territory in unspecified, the contract applies only to the territory of the Russian Federation. The remuneration must in general be given {{as a percentage of the}} gross income (sale price) generated by the use of the work, if the contract does not contain a remuneration clause, government-defined minimum schedules apply. The law prohibits the transfer of rights on future works or for future methods of exploitations. Unless the contract explicitly includes a sub-licensing permission, a licensee may not transfer some or all of the licensed rights to a third party.|$|E

Restrictive provisions in contracts where the consumer has little negotiating power ("contracts of adhesion") attract consumer protection scrutiny.|$|E

2500|$|However, in most cases, an insurer's {{ability to}} [...] "re-underwrite" [...] an {{existing}} guaranteed renewable policy {{is limited by}} <b>contract</b> <b>provisions</b> and the Affordable Care Act (previously by state law). Even so, premiums fluctuated significantly for existing policies if the average health of the policyholders with a particular product deteriorated, as often happened when rising premiums drove healthier individuals (who were able to buy other policies on more favorable terms) out of the product, leaving those who were relatively less healthy. One factor that drove that is the increase in costs, as individuals who initially pass underwriting develop health problems. In general, claim costs rose significantly over {{the first five years}} that an individual health insurance policy is in force.|$|E
2500|$|Compliance {{requirements}} are series of directives provided by Federal agencies that summarize hundreds {{of laws and}} regulations applicable to federal assistance and {{are important to the}} successful management of such assistance. The OMB created 14 basic and standard compliance requirements for which recipients must always comply with when receiving and using federal assistance, and provided detailed explanations, discussions, and guidance about them in the OMB Circular A-133 Compliance Supplement. [...] These compliance requirements only serve as guidelines for compliance with the specific laws and regulations applicable to the assistance and their objectives are designed to be generic in nature, because of the amount of different federal programs provided by the government. For example, many federal programs have eligibility requirements for individuals or organizations to participate in such programs because they have been established by either laws, regulations, or <b>contract</b> <b>provisions.</b> However, while the criterion for determining eligibility varies from program to program, the objective of the Eligibility compliance requirement that [...] "only eligible and qualified individuals or organizations participate" [...] is consistent and universal across all federal assistance programs. This eligibility universal criteria is called the Eligibility compliance requirement.|$|E

2500|$|When {{people start}} work, there will almost {{always be a}} {{contract}} of employment that governs the relationship of employee and the employing entity (usually a corporation, but occasionally a human being). A [...] "contract" [...] is an agreement enforceable in law. Very often it can be written down, or signed, but an oral agreement is also a fully enforceable contract. Because employees have unequal bargaining power to almost all employing entities, most employment contracts are [...] "standard form". Most terms and conditions are photocopied or reproduced for many people. Genuine negotiation is rare, unlike in commercial transactions between two business corporations. This has been the main justification for enactment of rights in federal and state law. The federal right to collective bargaining, by a labor union elected by its employees, is meant to reduce the inherently unequal bargaining power of individuals against organizations to make collective agreements. The federal right to a minimum wage, and increased overtime pay for working over 40 hours a week, was designed to ensure a [...] "minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers", even when a person {{could not get a}} high enough wage by individual bargaining. These and other rights, including family leave, rights against discrimination, or basic job security standards, were designed by the United States Congress and state legislatures to replace individual <b>contract</b> <b>provisions.</b> Statutory rights override even an express written term of a contract, usually unless the contract is more beneficial to an employee. Some federal statutes also envisage that state law rights can improve upon minimum rights. For example, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 entitles states and municipalities to set minimum wages beyond the federal minimum. By contrast, other statutes such as the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, have been interpreted in a series of contentious judgments by the US Supreme Court to [...] "preempt" [...] state law enactments. These interpretations have had the effect to [...] "stay experimentation in things social and economic" [...] and stop states wanting to [...] "serve as a laboratory" [...] by improving labor rights. Where minimum rights do not exist in federal or state statutes, principles of contract law, and potentially torts, will apply.|$|E
