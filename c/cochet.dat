5|$|At mid-season, Zürich {{newspaper}} Sport {{ranked the}} top 15 European players, and listed <b>Cochet</b> first (Borotra second, Brugnon ninth). At that time <b>Cochet</b> {{was struggling with}} a shoulder injury. For the 50th anniversary of the Wiener Park Club of Vienna a tournament was organized with an international line-up. The two biggest contenders <b>Cochet</b> and Roderich Menzel met in the final, <b>Cochet</b> made a comeback from one set down to lift the trophy. He then toured Europe to give exhibitions in Cluj-Napoca, Budapest and Prague. Because of fever and a sore throat <b>Cochet</b> missed the French Championships. He did not recover from his illness before the second Italian International Championships but this did not prevent <b>Cochet</b> from signing up for the competition. With titleholder Tilden having turned professional and Cochet's condition, the championships went easily to George Patrick Hughes. <b>Cochet</b> entered the finals of the doubles too, but his partner André Merlin couldn't make up for Cochet's bad shape and they lost to Alberto Del Bono and singles victor Hughes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cochet</b> {{then set}} to compete across Europe. As the reigning champions the French Davis Cup team {{had only one}} {{scheduled}} challenge match during the season and could skip the preliminary rounds. Lacoste and <b>Cochet</b> entered the British Hard Court Championships. Pat Spence eliminated <b>Cochet</b> in the semifinal stage but lost to Lacoste in the final. <b>Cochet</b> and Bennett gained the mixed doubles title. In May he accepted a one-on-one and a doubles challenge with Béla von Kehrling and the Hungarian Davis Cup team in Budapest. In front of a local crowd of 3000, <b>Cochet</b> won in four sets against the home favorite. The doubles match between Von Kehrling – Jenő Péteri and <b>Cochet</b> – Roger Danet was indefinitely suspended due to bad light conditions at 6–2, 7–9, one set each. The next stop was in Vienna where he won the Austrian International Championships. Returning home he secured his French International Championships title by overcoming Lacoste in the final in four sets. The doubles were won by Jean Borotra and Jacques Brugnon {{despite the efforts of}} <b>Cochet</b> and René de Buzelet. <b>Cochet</b> and recurring partner Bennett added the French hard courts mixed title to their set of accolades after defeating Helen Wills, women's world champion, and Frank Hunter, the No. 2 USLTA player in a three-set championship match. On 6 July at the 1928 Wimbledon Championships Lacoste equalized with a victory over <b>Cochet</b> and deprived him of the title. <b>Cochet</b> and Bennett lost in the mixed quarterfinals. <b>Cochet</b> and Brugnon won the doubles again over Gerald Patterson and John Hawkes after their 1926 triumph. At the end of July in the Challenge round of the Davis Cup at Roland Garros the Musketeers, with the absence of Brugnon, defeated the United States to keep the trophy in French possession. <b>Cochet</b> won all three of his rubbers.|$|E
5|$|A {{couple of}} weeks later in late June in the Wimbledon singles he again {{suffered}} a surprise loss to Ian Collins in the second round. In the mixed event <b>Cochet</b> and Whittingstall lost in semifinal stage, this time to Enrique Maier and Elizabeth Ryan. The singles competition was won by Ellsworth Vines, his first non-American title. The American Davis Cup team traveled back to France to challenge the reigning holder at the Stade Roland Garros. The French Musketeers secured the cup for the sixth and final time after four rubbers, losing only the doubles match. <b>Cochet</b> and Vines met in the dead fifth rubber. The face-off between the two {{was one of the few}} encounters that later had a decisive effect on the rankings. Vines ameliorated his team's result by defeating <b>Cochet</b> in five sets. The two European major champions then met in the final of the U.S. National Championships final in September. Vines kept the national title home with his second win, a straight sets 6–4 victory over <b>Cochet.</b> Vines and Keith Gledhill subsequently beat <b>Cochet</b> and Marcel Bernard in the doubles final. <b>Cochet</b> and Virginia Rice were dropped out in the mixed semifinal while Vines reached the finals. These losses sealed the fate of the year-end rankings.|$|E
50|$|Delphine Depardieu (born 8 March 1979) is a French actress.She is Alain Depardieu's daughter, and Gérard Depardieu's niece. After her {{training}} at the École internationale de création audiovisuelle et de réalisation (EICAR), at the Cours Simon and Jean-Laurent <b>Cochet's</b> course, she was drawn to scene and cinematography. On stage, she has acted with Roland Giraud, Paul Belmondo and Alexandre Brasseur.|$|R
5000|$|We are able, {{thanks to}} <b>Cochet's</b> conclusions, {{to study the}} {{deliveries}} of three great servers {{of the past few}} years—Tilden, Vines and Doeg. Opinions will vary as to their comparative effectiveness {{as well as some of}} their other qualities. Certainly no one will deny that in their services the three players named possessed assets of tremendous value. It would be of great interest to obtain opinions of the varying degree of game winning value possessed by each.There was this difference between the three men: Doeg’s service was his chief weapon, and once he had broken through an opponent he was thought to be certain of winning that set. With Tilden and Vines the service was only one of many weapons, and it was employed intermittently and sometimes kept in reserve for time of need.|$|R
40|$|A {{sectional}} {{model for}} simultaneous flow convection and electrostatic force {{is presented to}} predict performance of a plate-wire electrostatic precipitator (ESP). The electric field distribution was gained by solving Poisson's equation and the current continuity equation, the particle charge was obtained by <b>Cochet's</b> equation, and the sectional approach was employed for simulating the evolution of particle-size distribution along the ESP. The mass efficiencies predicted by the present model are in good agreement with experimental data of Salcedo and Munz (1978, Proc. 3 rd Int. Conf: on Electrostatic Precipitation, Italy, pp. 343 - 359) at high applied voltages (greater {{than or equal to}} 30 kV). Under the same operating conditions the present model along with Deustch-Anderson, Feldman, Southern Research Institute (SoRI), and moment-lognormal models are tested to determine their relative abilities in predicting the Salcedo and Munz experimental data. The present model was also applied to provide insight into the evolution of particle-size distribution along a plate-wire ESP and its effects on the ESP performance. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

5|$|After the Davis Cup tie <b>Cochet</b> only {{played in}} minor tournament and doubles matches. He won the singles in La Baule against Raymond Rodel and the mixed doubles in Vals-les-Bains. Rodel, <b>Cochet,</b> Jacques Brugnon and Pierre Henri Landry, {{representing}} the Racing Club de Paris, sailed to Japan {{for a series}} of friendly matches against the Japanese Davis Cup team where <b>Cochet</b> suffered a surprise defeat against Takeichi Harada. They then visited India to face the Indian Davis Cup team in a series of exhibitions. <b>Cochet</b> won all of his matches. In 1929 <b>Cochet</b> was ranked number one by several journals and journalists most notably by A Wallis Myers, Hungarian tennis magazine Tennisz és Golf, edited by Béla von Kehrling and on the list of rival Bill Tilden. Evidently he led the French rankings as well. In December he was inducted as Honorary Member to the U.S.L.T.A. in New York.|$|E
5|$|After these losses <b>Cochet</b> {{took two}} weeks off to recover. Despite {{the rest in}} the 1931 Wimbledon Championships he shocked the tennis world by losing {{in the very first}} round to Nigel Sharpe. In the mixed doubles <b>Cochet</b> and Eileen Bennett Whittingstall were not more successful, falling in the fourth round. The doubles final {{remained}} unconquered for Brugnon and <b>Cochet</b> as the team of George Lott and John Van Ryn came back from 3–2 down in the fifth set to win the match. In July the Four Musketeers were ready to be challenged for the fifth time in the Davis Cup final. This time the opponent was the British Davis Cup team. In the first rubber <b>Cochet</b> was facing two set points for a two sets-love lead by Bunny Austin but fought back to claim the second set and won the next two for the match. Fred Perry battled through Borotra while the doubles were won by <b>Cochet</b> and Brugnon. Austin brought back the British hopes after a four set victory over the exhausted Borotra. The match was suspended multiple times due to rain, which made the court almost unsuitable for playing, which left its mark on the deciding rubber between <b>Cochet</b> and Perry. The recurring slight rain in the first set led Perry to drop the set from a 4–1 advantage. The second set went to Perry after he utilized passing shots as a counter for Cochet's net play. The third and fourth set however were taken by <b>Cochet</b> which gave the French team its fifth successive Davis Cup.|$|E
5|$|During 1932 <b>Cochet</b> {{restricted}} {{his schedule}} to appearances at Monaco Cups, the French Championships, Wimbledon, U.S. National Championships and the Davis Cup and a minor tournament in Paris. In Monaco the Butler Trophy were won by <b>Cochet</b> and Jacques Brugnon over the Czechoslovakian duo of Roderich Menzel and Ferenc Marsalek. The mixed doubles was granted to <b>Cochet</b> and Colette Rosambert following {{the retirement of}} Béla von Kehrling and Elizabeth Ryan prior to the match due to the leg pain of Ryan. After that good start <b>Cochet</b> was ranked number one by Pierre Gillou right ahead of Ellsworth Vines and Bunny Austin.|$|E
5|$|In July the French {{team was}} {{challenged}} by the United States team in the 1929 Davis Cup three-day final. On 26 July 12,000 people watched {{the first day of}} the encounter at the Roland Garros stadium. The French squad took the lead when Borotra beat George Lott. The second match was scheduled between <b>Cochet</b> and Tilden. The American started off poorly; he was not able to win one single point in the first game, hit many unforced errors, especially in the longer rallies, and <b>Cochet</b> pulled away and took the set. In the second Tilden forced a backhand game, but it did not pay off, and he lost that set as well, six games to one. Tilden relied on his serves but was only capable of winning six games in the whole match when he lost the third set six to two. According to contemporary statistics <b>Cochet</b> did not hit any unforced errors of faults during the match. The next day French captain Pierre Gillou sent <b>Cochet</b> and Borotra for the doubles rubber. <b>Cochet</b> was exhausted and showed the opposite form compared to the previous day. Despite all efforts by his partner Borotra, <b>Cochet</b> hit most of the balls out or into the net. The American duo of Wilmer Allison and John Van Ryn took a three-set win. The third day Tilden saved the hopes for his team when he beat Borotra in front of a capacity crowd of 15,000. The deciding rubber was between <b>Cochet</b> and George Lott. <b>Cochet</b> won in four sets and claimed the Cup for France for the third time.|$|E
5|$|In November <b>Cochet</b> only {{competed in}} the Toussaint tournament, held at the Tennis Club de Paris, {{alongside}} Colette Rosambert with whom he lost to Jean Borotra and his more skilled female partner Helen Wills Moody. The year 1932 {{marked the first time}} <b>Cochet</b> slipped {{off the top of the}} charts after switching places with Vines. In June 1933 <b>Cochet,</b> seeded first, relinquished his French Championships title to Australian Jack Crawford, who overwhelmed him in the final in three straight sets, becoming the first non-French player to possess it. In July the French team lost the Davis Cup for the first time since 1927. In front of their home crowd on the clay courts of Roland Garros, but without Lacoste and Borotra, the French team lost 3–2 to Great Britain. <b>Cochet</b> was defeated by Fred Perry and won against Bunny Austin, both in five sets. At the 1933 Wimbledon Championships first-seeded Vines conquered <b>Cochet,</b> who was seeded third, in straight sets in the semifinal. It was the third time in a row that Vines beat <b>Cochet.</b> These events marked the end of the Four Musketeers era.|$|E
5|$|In early 1934 Plaa and <b>Cochet</b> {{went on to}} {{showcase}} in Rio de Janeiro where they were challenged by the Pilo Facondi and Perico Facondi brothers, Chile's leading professionals, who both lost their matches against <b>Cochet</b> but managed to win at least one set. Plaa and <b>Cochet</b> returned in February to the Madison Square Garden where Vines and Tilden were already practising and waiting for them. In a three-day round robin indoors tournament Vines and Tilden outclassed <b>Cochet</b> in a four and five-set match respectively and the Americans were victorious in the doubles over the French pair as well. They then {{set out on a}} ten-city tour across the United States and Canada where the Tilden-Cochet match was always the main fixture. Tilden finished the tour as winner by an eight to two head-to-head margin against <b>Cochet.</b> In April in Providence <b>Cochet</b> was drawn to play Vincent Richards in singles and with Plaa played Barnes and Richards, both matches resulted in a French two straight sets victory. The first official knock-out tournament was held in May at the Park Avenue Tennis Club, New York and was called the Eastern Pro Championships. <b>Cochet</b> was eliminated in the semifinals.|$|E
5|$|In late May Philadelphia {{hosted the}} Middle States tournament at its Germantown Cricket Club; <b>Cochet</b> {{advanced}} to the semifinal where Tilden's superiority proved to be his undoing. <b>Cochet</b> then sailed home to France and consequently missed the US Pro Tennis Championships. He chose instead to gather money in exhibition matches in Havana, Haiti, and Martinique on his way home. In France the official tour continued in Bayonne in August, where <b>Cochet</b> dropped his two singles matches to Tilden and Keith Gledhill {{in front of a}} home crowd. A Marseilles team event was scheduled in September where <b>Cochet</b> lost to Tilden, equalized against Gledhill and lost again in the doubles with Plaa to the Americans, who took the final victory as well. Two weeks later in a single-elimination tournament at Cochet's native Lyon Football Club he almost delighted the crowd with home victory but Tilden stole the second and third set to spoil the feat. <b>Cochet</b> subsequently suffered from an illness and missed the following events. Throughout the season <b>Cochet</b> earned a total of $17.381.|$|E
5|$|Also in Paris in April <b>Cochet</b> {{failed to}} capture the International Championships title {{dropping}} it to Marcel Bernard. In the 1948–49 International Christmas Tournament of Barcelona <b>Cochet</b> met Masip in the doubles final, where the Spanish team of Masip-Carles granted a walkover to <b>Cochet</b> and Australian Jack Harper. In April 1949 <b>Cochet</b> knocked out Masip from the Paris International Tournament in the quarterfinals. They joined forces for the doubles contest, which they subsequently won. In May he faced Masip again in the championships match of the British Hard Court Championships, and lost to him in four sets. In August he was a singles and doubles finalist in the International Championships of Istanbul. In singles he was overcome by Gottfried von Cramm and in doubles by von Cramm and Harper. In December he finally acquired the Barcelona title by beating Harper in five sets.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cochet</b> married Germaine Desthieux on 16 April 1926. He {{taught her}} how to play tennis and later entered minor tournaments together. Apart from playing tennis <b>Cochet</b> was an amateur ice-hockey player. He ran a {{sporting}} goods store in Paris. <b>Cochet</b> was an occasional coach as well and in 1930 he coached the French junior tennis team once a week for free including his brother-in-law Georges Desthieux who won the New Malden tournament that year. He was awarded the Red Ribbon of the Legion of Honour for his sport merits in 1951. He died on 1 April 1987, aged 85, in Saint-Germain-en-Laye.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cochet</b> {{played one}} of his last matches at the Swiss covered courts championships in St. Moritz, {{returning}} to the scene of his very first tennis triumph after a 36-year hiatus. At the age of 56 with his partner Bernard Destremau he managed to pass {{the first round of the}} doubles contest with a 6–2, 6–1 win over locals D. Wegs and H. Flury. <b>Cochet</b> retired from tennis later that year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cochet</b> {{then set}} out for an {{exhibition}} tour through central Europe in June, playing in Budapest, Belgrade and Vienna.|$|E
5|$|In 1931 <b>Cochet</b> {{retained}} the Carlton L.T.C. doubles with Brugnon. In March he defeated George Lyttleton-Rogers {{for his third}} Monaco Cup crown. With Eileen Bennett Whittingstall they were crowned the mixed victors. <b>Cochet</b> became the Danish Covered Courts champion {{for the first time}} after defeating Danish national champion Einer Ulrich in Copenhagen. He won the mixed contest as well with Simone Barbier. He was invited by his hometown club F.C. Lyon to an interclub match with German Uhlenhorster Klipper. <b>Cochet</b> won all three of his matches. In the Moncean Club of Paris he partnered Paul Féret and Colette Rosambert and swept the doubles and mixed doubles respectively.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after he}} entered the amateur scene <b>Cochet</b> won every {{possible}} major tournament of the era. In February 1922 he traveled to the World Covered Court Championships in Saint Moritz in Switzerland where he defeated Borotra in a five-set final and formed a team with him to gain the doubles trophy against Jacques Brugnon and Marcel Dupont. He clinched a triple crown feat at the 1922 World Hard Court Championships in Brussels defeating Count Manuel de Gomar in the singles final and triumphing in the doubles events, partnering Jean Borotra and Suzanne Lenglen respectively. After his success abroad <b>Cochet</b> claimed the French Closed Championships by defeating defending champion Jean Samazeuilh in the final. Afterwards <b>Cochet</b> topped the French rankings. In June 1922 he debuted in the French Davis Cup team against Denmark and won both his singles and the doubles match. In the next round the team only composed of him and André Gobert {{and fell to the}} Australasian team. <b>Cochet</b> also found moderate success in the minor tournaments; at the South of France Championships he lost to Russian Count Mikhail Sumarokov-Elston. At the Côte d'Azur Championships <b>Cochet</b> warded off the Englishman Morgan for his first Riviera title.|$|E
5|$|The {{overseas}} {{campaign of}} <b>Cochet</b> {{started at the}} U.S. National Championships, which he kept for France {{for the third straight}} time. His opponent in the final was Frank Hunter with whom he fought a five-set battle. In October the French supremacy continued with him and Christian Boussus sharing the final Pacific Southwest Championships of Los Angeles, <b>Cochet</b> claimed that title as well. In early December Racing Club de Paris, Cochet's club, visited Hamburg for an inter-club match. The French team left with a landslide victory over the German top ranked players; the score was eleven to one. He finished the year with the Coupe de Noël in Paris during the last days of December. The final saw Jean Borotra forfeiting to <b>Cochet.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{playing tennis}} {{he took up}} {{volunteer}} coaching, training French children in Paris every Sunday. In the sixth straight United States–France Davis Cup final the American team had a great start thanks to Bill Tilden, who handed Borotra the first loss of the tie. <b>Cochet</b> equalized against George Lott, winning in straight sets. In the doubles Cochet—Brugnon were selected to compete against Wimbledon champions John van Ryn and Wilmer Allison. Contrary to expectations it was Borotra who was the engine of the French pair. He won every service game, except for the third set where <b>Cochet</b> {{made a lot of}} errors at the net, and the French pair took the victory. Borotra thrilled the French spectators by beating Lott and keeping the Cup in France for another year. The dead rubber between <b>Cochet</b> and Tilden was won by the former. At {{the end of the year}} <b>Cochet</b> was ranked number one by Wallis Myers and Pierre Gillou but came second in the unofficial list of Bill Tilden behind Borotra.|$|E
5|$|All these {{achievements}} were {{a prelude}} to the 1927 Wimbledon Championships where in successive rounds <b>Cochet</b> defeated two leading Americans Frank Hunter and Bill Tilden and finally Jean Borotra in remarkable five set matches, {{all of whom had}} a two-sets advantage against him. Tilden served for the match, leading 5–1 in the third set and had a match ball. In the final Borotra left six match points unconverted to open the route for Cochet's revival. With the latter one <b>Cochet</b> set a Wimbledon final comeback record that stands up to this day. He then again met Hunter and Tilden in the final of the doubles, this time he joining forces with Jacques Brugnon and lost the championship despite having a match point. This was the first of three consecutive encounters between the French and American teams as in early September the 1927 Davis Cup final took place in the United States where the US Davis Cup team led by Tilden and Hunter faced the challenging team of the Musketeers. France won 3–2 with <b>Cochet</b> victorious in the decider against Bill Johnston and reclaiming the Davis Cup for France the first time since 1920. A couple of days later the French troupe went to compete in the U.S. National Championships at the West Side Tennis Club in New York. <b>Cochet</b> and Eileen Bennett became the mixed doubles champions. When he returned home {{in the first week of}} October <b>Cochet</b> took revenge on Christian Boussus in their second meeting in the final of the Coupe Porée of Paris. The same week he was ranked third in the world for the second consecutive year although this time he finished ahead of compatriot Borotra. In November he won the Swiss Covered Courts Internationals in a short twenty-five-minute final against Donald Greig.|$|E
5|$|Born in Villeurbanne, Rhône, <b>Cochet</b> won ten amateur Majors (four French Championships, two Wimbledons, one U.S. Championship, one World Hard Court Championship and two World Covered Court Championships) and one {{professional}} Major (French Pro) {{during his}} singles career (achieving victory on three different surfaces). He was ranked as world No. 1 player for four consecutive years, 1928 through 1931 by A. Wallis Myers. <b>Cochet</b> turned professional in 1933, {{but after a}} less than stellar pro career he was reinstated as an amateur {{after the end of}} World War II in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{turbulent}} year <b>Cochet</b> {{was ranked}} number one by A Wallis Myers, Sport magazine of Zürich (both European and World rankings) and Pierre Gillou.|$|E
5|$|Henri <b>Cochet</b> {{was born}} on 14 December 1901 in Villeurbanne to Gustave <b>Cochet</b> and Antoinette Gailleton. His father was a groundkeeper at a Lyonnaise tennis club where Henri worked as a ball boy and thus {{had a chance to}} {{practise}} for free. He began playing at the age of eight along with his sister. The president of the club, a silk-factory owner and French-ranked player Georges Cozon, recognized his talent and volunteered to coach him. He entered his first local tournament in 1920 where he met his mentor in the final. <b>Cochet</b> then moved on to win a series of matches at Aix-les-Bains mostly scratch and handicap matches. In 1921 he decided to compete in Paris, which was the center of tennis life, and registered for the French Covered Courts tournament second-class draw, in which he reached the final where he beat Jean Borotra in five sets. That qualified him for entry at the 1921 French Closed Championships where he repeated his victory over Borotra and subsequently broke into the top ten French rankings {{at the end of the}} year. Also in 1921 he won the Military Championship of France. Meanwhile, his sister Aimée (Charpenel) <b>Cochet</b> also became a tennis player and competed in the main draw of the 1930 Wimbledon Championships.|$|E
5|$|In May at the 34th French Championships the men's doubles tournament {{took place}} first. With Lacoste – Borotra's victory over Tilden – Hunter and <b>Cochet</b> – Brugnon's easy win over Gregory – Collins {{in the semifinals}} secured the Four Musketeers their third doubles {{face-to-face}} final. Unfortunately for <b>Cochet</b> in the fifth set they were serving for the match and had thirty-love in the game, when Brugnon missed an easy ball when three match points were at stake. Lacoste and Borotra revived {{from that moment on}} and closed out the final set 8–6. In singles he was put out of the contest by Borotra in the semifinals and thus was unable to retain his title. However, <b>Cochet</b> did not leave without a trophy as the mixed championship was earned by him and Eileen Bennett Whittingstall.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} pre-World War II year Cochet's pro status {{allowed him to}} accept {{the request of the}} Hungarian Davis Cup team to become its trainer. He was then invited to the inaugural World Pro Championships, which was held at the Roland Garros in June–July. <b>Cochet</b> and Tilden were on the same half of the draw and it set up a {{semifinal}} clash which <b>Cochet</b> was forced out of the tournament in five sets. He and Ramillon had a shot at the doubles title but they came short against pro newcomer Don Budge and veteran Ellsworth Vines.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September 1933 <b>Cochet</b> turned professional, {{signing a}} {{contract}} with the Tilden Tennis Tour for a guaranteed annual payment of £25.000 and joined the team of Bill Tilden and Martin Plaa. Although he was still featured on the amateur world rankings published on the 20th of the month, where he was listed one spot behind Ellsworth Vines at number six, <b>Cochet</b> was also on Pierre Gillou's list in fourth place, also right after Vines. <b>Cochet</b> made his professional debut in a Franco-American match on 22 September and defeated Bruce Barnes. Three days later he lost to Tilden in straight sets. He also made appearances at the French Riviera with Plaa with back and forth matches across France. On 10 October Tilden signed Vines to the pro tour and from then Cochet's archrival and him competed within the same league again.|$|E
5|$|Post-war tennis life resumed at the 1945–46 International Christmas Tournament of Barcelona where Yvon Petra {{dismissed}} <b>Cochet</b> in four sets. They reunited for the doubles event, {{which went}} to the home favorite duo of Jaime Bartroli and Pedro Masip. At the time <b>Cochet</b> was the coach of Petra. In January the following year he reached the doubles final of the Estoril International Tournament partnering Robert Abdesselam. They met in singles competition in March at the Egypt International Championships where <b>Cochet</b> outplayed Abdesselam in straight sets. In July he celebrated his first Dutch championships title at Noordwijk with an overwhelming victory over Eustace Fannin. In 1948 a rivalry emerged between him and Spaniard Masip. They met in the French Covered Court Championship final where it took five sets to decide the outcome in favor of Masip.|$|E
5|$|The Four Musketeers were {{inducted}} simultaneously {{into the}} International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island in 1976. <b>Cochet</b> died in 1987 in Paris at age 85.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 a Closed French Championships was {{announced}} and the doubles was won by <b>Cochet</b> and Bernard Destremau. In 1943 {{he reached the}} singles finals in the same nationals losing it to Yvon Petra. He also participated in charity matches {{to raise funds for}} the prisoners of the Axis powers. The next year <b>Cochet</b> met Petra for the title and lost for the second consecutive time. In the last wartime championships of France he won the doubles title alongside Pierre Pellizza. Despite being a reinstated amateur he was still ranked 9th in the first official pro rankings published by the World's Professional Tennis Association in 1945. After the End of World War II in Europe he played his first international match in Paris against Bill Sidwell, which he easily won.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Courage Compétition {{began running}} their updated C60 Hybrid, whilst Pescarolo also updated their C60; {{the two teams}} were the fastest and second fastest {{respectively}} at the Paul Ricard test session. At the LMES season opener, which was the 1000km of Spa, the Courage-entered car, driven by <b>Cochet,</b> Christian Vann and Alexander Frei was eliminated in a pit-lane accident, whilst the Pescarolo entry, driven by Bouillon, Collard and Comas finished second. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, both teams entered two cars; Courage entered Frei, Vann and Dominik Schwager in one car, and <b>Cochet,</b> Shinji Nakano and Bruce Jouanny in the other, whilst Pescarolo ran Collard, Boullion and Comas {{in one of their}} C60s, with Ayari, Hélary and Sébastien Loeb in the other. One car from each team finished; Collard, Boullion and Comas took second for Pescarolo, whilst Schwager, Frei and Vann finished eighth for Courage. Both teams reverted to single-car entries for the 1000km of Monza, which Collard and Boullion won for Pescarolo; the Gounon/Vann/Frei combination in the Courage finished sixth overall, and fourth in the LMP1 category. For the 1000 km of Silverstone, it was Frei, Vann and <b>Cochet,</b> driving for Courage, who were the fastest C60; they took 14th, and 13th in class, whilst Collard and Boullion had problems and finished 34th, and 17th in class. The 1000km of Nürburgring saw Boullion and Collard take fourth for Pescarolo, whilst Frei and <b>Cochet</b> took eighth for Courage. At the final round of the season, which was the 1000 km of Istanbul, Collard and Boullion took another victory for Pescarolo, whilst the Courage of Gounon and Frei took 21st overall, and eighth in class. This result meant that Pescarolo had won their first ever team's championship, whilst Courage finished seventh.|$|E
5|$|In 1937 he did {{not succeed}} in {{defending}} his French Pro title as Hans Nüsslein took it from him in three sets. The doubles final was played betweenStoefen–Tilden and Cochet-Ramillon with the former team crowned champions in the end. <b>Cochet</b> then repeated the Soviet tour and missed the German Pro and the Bonnardel Cup. He returned to the tour at the Wembley Pro where he only won one match before having been knocked out in the semifinal stage. <b>Cochet</b> then was a part of a rather fruitless Italian tour, his only notably victory came in the Foro Italico against Tilden. The next year was spent mostly with Cochet-Tilden headlined trips to India and Ireland. He also returned to the Soviet Union for the third straight time to accept a coaching venture, {{which turned out to be}} a short-term assignment as the Soviet government accused him of espionage and expelled him.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 France was {{overrun by}} Nazi Germany {{and for a}} brief period of time <b>Cochet</b> fell into war captivity. After his release he wasn't allowed to leave the country. He {{launched}} his own sporting goods store in Paris and lived on a farm in the outskirts. He gave tennis broadcasts, and accepted the Vichy government's offer to head its youth tennis program and after that to become a sports commissioner, who organized sport programmes for the deported French armament workers. In December 1940 the first open tennis tournament, combining amateur and professional players, was organized in Paris where <b>Cochet</b> lost to Paul Féret. In December 1941 he regained his amateur status granted by the French Tennis Association. This was in line with the sports policy of the Vichy regime which opposed professionalism. The policy was administered by Borotra who had been appointed General Commissioner for Education and Sports in August 1940.|$|E
5|$|The {{winner of}} the men's singles event {{receives}} the Coupe des Mousquetaires, named after The Four Musketeers of French tennis: Jean Borotra, Jacques Brugnon, Henri <b>Cochet,</b> and René Lacoste.
