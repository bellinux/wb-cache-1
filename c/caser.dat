The determination of magnetic depole and electric quadrupole moments of these nuclei is also the aim of the paper. As a result it has been shown, that in some <b>casers</b> RMSCR may not be nescribed satisfactorily in frameworks of a drop model with the account of deformation parameters. The account of additional effects, the modification of a surface layer thickness, for example, is necessary for the best coordination with an experiment. The plant created may be used for the investigation of RMSCR and nuclei moments of a wide class of elements and also for the isotopic and element analysis. The new experimental data obtained for RMSCR of the nuclei investigated and also new optical data may be the table data in further investigations in the field of nuclear and atomic physics, optics. The palnt created has been introduced into operation. The experimental results obtained have been used in the processing of experimental data.

5000|$|The ruling dynasty of East Anglia, the Wuffingas, {{were named}} for Wuffa, son of Wehha, who is made the {{ancestor}} {{of the historical}} Wuffingas dynasty, and given a pedigree from Woden. Wehha appears as Ƿehh Ƿilhelming (Wehha Wilhelming - son of Wilhelm) in the Anglian Collection. According to the 9th-century History of the Britons, his father Guillem Guercha (the Wilhelm of the Anglian Collection pedigree) was the first king of the East Angles, but D. P.

From Wilhelm the pedigree is continued back through Hryþ, Hroðmund (a name otherwise only known from Beowulf), Trygil, Tyttman, <b>Caser</b> (Latin Caesar, i.e. Julius Caesar) to Woden.

40|$|Abstract. An {{adaptation}} phase {{is crucial for}} a good and reasonable Case-Based Planning (CBP) system. The {{adaptation phase}} is responsible for finding a solution in order to solve a new problem. If the phase is not well designed, the CBP system may not solve the desirable range of problems or the solutions will not have appropriate quality. In this paper, a method called <b>CASER</b> – Case Adaptation by Segment Replanning – is presented as an adaptation rule for case-based planning system. The method has two phases:. the first one completes a retrieved case as an easy-to-generate solution method. The second phase improves {{the quality of the}} solution by using a generic heuristic in a recursive algorithm to determine segments of the plan to be replanned. The <b>CASER</b> method does not use any additional knowledge, and it can find as good solutions as those found by the best generative planners. ...|$|E

40|$|Geographic routing {{protocols}} {{are the most}} preferred {{routing protocols}} for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) since they rely on geographic position information. Hence we propose geography based Resource Constraint Secure routing (RCS) protocol. The existing routing protocol named Cost Aware SEcure Routing (<b>CASER)</b> allows messages to be transmitted using random walking routing strategy. In the Random walking method, {{there is a chance}} of choosing low energy node as a relay node. RCS protocol overcomes this by transmitting the data via energy aware route only and it provides authentication by using Modified ElGammal Signature (MES) scheme on Elliptic curve algorithm. For security purposes, the content of each message can also be encrypted by using a symmetric key encryption technique and decoded at the sink node by knowing the same secret key used by the source. So, unauthenticated person cannot access the original data. Therefore the protocol ensures a secure message delivery option to maximize the message delivery ratio under adversarial attacks. The performance evaluation results show that RCS performs better than <b>CASER</b> with respect to Packet Delivery Ratio, Energy Balance Factor and End-to-End Delay, Throughput and Routing overhead...|$|E

The authentication solves the problem of outside hackers and uses of <b>caser</b> cryptography solve the problem of hacker within the organization.

40|$|Part 4 : Engineering of Enterprise Software ProductsInternational audienceEnergy {{efficient}} routing is {{the main}} challenge of the researchers {{in the field of}} wireless sensor network for a long decade. Resource constrained sensor nodes demand energy consumption as less as possible. Energy efficiency can be achieved by localization and clustering technique. Localization is used to find out the location of sensor nodes without the help of GPS and avoids broadcasting of too many messages to save energy. Event based clustering approach can reduce data redundancy in order to avoid wastage of energy. The proposed approach LAVCA has used both of the techniques in order to diminish energy consumption and increase network lifetime up to a great extent. Packet loss has also been reduced by involving an anti-void approach, called rolling ball technique.

The appearance and microstructural evolution of the SrF 2 crystals in the resulting glass ceramics were investigated using X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission microscopy. The SrF 2 crystals are similar to 15 mu m in size and are uniformly distributed throughout the fluorophosphate glass matrix. The glass ceramics achieve an average transmittance of 75 % in the visible region and more than 85 % in the near-IR region. The high transmittance of the glass ceramics results from matching the refractive index of the SrF 2 {{with that of the}} precursor glass.

The finding of this research shows that, after theimplementation of the policy, fertilizer distribution system becomes shorter (simpler) andfertilizers are distributed through many channels, so that farmers can buy fertilizers easily andat relatively low prices. Because of capital constraint, KUDs can not compete with nonCooperation of Village Unit Cooperation (non-KUDs) distributors.
