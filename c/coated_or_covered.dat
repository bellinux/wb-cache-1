50|$|Reference Point Indentation (RPI) {{refers to}} a {{specialized}} form of indentation testing. RPI utilizes a unique method of measurement by establishing a relative reference point {{at the location of}} measurement. This unique capability makes it possible to measure materials that are in motion, oddly shaped, visco-elastic, or that may be <b>coated</b> <b>or</b> <b>covered</b> by another, softer material.|$|E
5000|$|To {{discourage}} {{chewing on}} an object, {{it can be}} <b>coated</b> <b>or</b> <b>covered</b> with something to make it distasteful: for instance a soft cloth doused with chili pepper paste or powder. Capsaicin and Ro-pel are other forms of repellent. To remain effective, the coating must be renewed regularly, especially if it is exposed to the weather. Poisoning squirrels can be problematic because of the risks to innocent parties, [...] and because the odor of a dead squirrel in an attic or wall cavity is very unpleasant and persistent.|$|E
50|$|In {{a theater}} fly system, a rope lock is a device {{used to prevent}} a rope, and the line set it controls, from moving. A rope lock is {{controlled}} by a steel handle that engages the lock when vertical and releases it when horizontal. The handle is typically red powder <b>coated</b> <b>or</b> <b>covered</b> by a red rubber grip. A steel, oval-shaped safety ring encircles both the rope and the handle {{to ensure that the}} lock cannot be accidentally released. Rope locks are mounted to a locking rail, which provides structural support and holds them at a convenient level for the stage crew.|$|E

50|$|Elkington {{was born}} in Birmingham, {{the son of a}} {{spectacle}} manufacturer. Apprenticed to his uncles' silver plating business in 1815, he became, on their death, sole proprietor of the business, but subsequently took his cousin, Henry Elkington, into partnership. The science of electrometallurgy was then in its infancy, but the Elkingtons were quick to recognize its possibilities. They had already taken out certain patents for the application of electricity to metals when, in 1840, John Wright, a Birmingham surgeon, discovered the valuable properties of a solution of cyanide of silver in potassium cyanide for electroplating purposes. The Elkingtons purchased and patented Wright's process (British Patent 8447 : Improvements in <b>Coating,</b> <b>Covering,</b> <b>or</b> Plating certain Metals), subsequently acquiring the rights of other processes and improvements. In 1843 Elkingtons acquired the rights to Werner von Siemens's first invention, an improvement to the gold and silver plating process.|$|R
40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} of the apical zone of lactating rat mammary {{epithelial cells}} was studied {{with emphasis on}} vesicle coat structures. Typical 40 - 60 nm ID "coated vesicles" were abundant, frequently associated with the internal filamentous plasma membrane <b>coat</b> <b>or</b> in direct continuity with secretory vesicles (SV) or plasma membrane proper. Bristle <b>coats</b> partially <b>or</b> totally <b>covered</b> membranes of secretory vesicles identified by their casein micelle content. This coat survived SV isolation. Exocytotic fusion of SV membranes and release of the casein micelles was observed. Frequently, regularly arranged bristle coat structures were identified in those regions of the plasma membrane that were involved in exocytotic processes. Both coated and uncoated surfaces of the casein-containing vesicles, as well as typical "coated vesicles", were frequently associated with microtubules and/or microfilaments. We suggest that coat materials of vesicles are related or identical to components of the internal coat of the surface membrane and that new plasma membrane and associated internal coat is produced concomitantly by fusion and integration of bristle coat moieties. Postexocytotic association of secreted casein micelles with the cell surface, mediated by finely filamentous extensions, provided a marker for the integrated vesicle membrane. An arrangement of SV with the inner surface of the plasma membrane is described which is characterized by regularly spaced, heabily stained membrane to membrane cross-bridges (pre-exocytotic attachment plaques). Such membrane-interconnecting elements may represent a form of coat structure important to recognition and interaction of membrane surfaces...|$|R
50|$|The {{difference}} in expansion characteristics between rubber and braided stainless steel brake lines {{is a result}} of differences in hose construction. Where rubber hoses typically consist of a rubber inner hose wrapped in a textile reinforcement braid then covered in an additional rubber outer sheath, braided stainless steel hoses typically consist of a Teflon® or generic PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) inner hose wrapped in a braid consisting of stainless steel wire. The stainless wire braid more effectively resists expansion due to pressure inside the hose core. This improves brake system effectiveness by more directly transferring operator input (hydraulic pressure) to brake friction surfaces. While available without a coating, the stainless braid is typically <b>coated</b> <b>or</b> <b>covered</b> with a clear or colored material such as PVC (polyvinyl chloride) to protect the wire and inner hose from the elements and chemicals, to protect the vehicle or machine from abrasion, and for an improved appearance. Coated braided stainless steel hoses have the same essential construction as rubber hoses in terms of an inner hose wrapped in a braid followed by an outer layer, but the different materials in the braided stainless steel hoses offer substantially different and arguably better characteristics. To more thoroughly explain why, it is helpful to understand the basics of a hydraulic brake system.|$|E
40|$|Metallic surface {{roughness}} in a nominally smooth surface {{is a potential}} indication of material degradation or damage. When the surface is <b>coated</b> <b>or</b> <b>covered</b> with an opaque dielectric material, such as paint or insulation, then inspecting for surface changes becomes almost impossible. Terahertz NDE is a method capable of penetrating the coating and inspecting the metallic surface. The terahertz frequency regime is between 100 GHz and 10 THz and has a free space wavelength of 300 micrometers at 1 THz. Pulsed terahertz radiation, can be generated and detected using optical excitation of biased semiconductors with femtosecond laser pulses. The resulting time domain signal is 320 picoseconds in duration. In this application, samples are inspected with a commercial terahertz NDE system that scans the sample and generates a set of time-domain signals that are {{a function of the}} backscatter from the metallic surface. Post processing is then performed in the time and frequency domains to generate C-scan type images that show scattering effects due to surface non-uniformity...|$|E

40|$|International audienceTo {{quantify}} the flow rate through multicomponent geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs), three different meter-sized specimens from different manufacturers were characterized in a dedicated experimental column. This study allows quantification of the interface transmissivity of multicomponent GCLs when the <b>coating</b> <b>or</b> attached film is damaged over an area {{large enough to}} make edge effects negligible. For all multicomponent GCLs characterized, the <b>coating</b> <b>or</b> attached film was less than 0. 7 mm thick. Steady-state results indicated flow rates ranging from 4. 61 × 10 &# 8722; 12 to 3. 01 × 10 &# 8722; 11 m 3 /s with interface transmissivities ranging from 1. 20 × 10 &# 8722; 11 to 7. 59 × 10 &# 8722; 11 m 2 /s, which are broadly in line with flow rates obtained from conventional geomembrane (GM) -GCL composite liners.
