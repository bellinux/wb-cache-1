5|$|Compared to Final Fantasy XI, where party-based {{gameplay}} is forefront at all times, the gameplay in XIV is adjusted so {{that players}} <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> longer periods without joining a party. There is no auto-attack option, with each action needing a manual input while an enemy is targeted. Each action uses up a stamina bar. Through defeating monsters, crafting items, and completing quests, players accumulate EXP which, when a certain threshold is reached, automatically increments the player's level. The player's level affects attributes such as HP (health/hit points), MP (magic/mana points), {{and the number}} of abilities available to them.|$|E

500|$|Several critics {{felt that}} {{events in the}} episode—particularly the terrorist-caused blackouts in major cities around the world, and the public relegitimization of S.H.I.E.L.D.—were {{problematic}} due to the series' connection to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Meslow felt it was questionable for the series to feature a crisis such as the blackouts, given they [...] "would surely {{attract the attention of}} at least one Avenger". Valentine felt that the S.H.I.E.L.D. announcement would fall alongside other events on the series that [...] "will never be reflected in the [...] movies ... it does sometimes make you aggravated when the series <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> such broad strokes to the universe without any mention in the movies themselves".

Dublin first round auditions returned in 2010 with the auditions held on 28 June. In 2011, The X Factor did not hold auditions in Ireland, instead replacing them with a new audition city, Liverpool. A source from The X Factor said: [...] "There are only so many places we <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> auditions.

2500|$|Brownsville has a humid {{subtropical}} climate (Köppen Cfa), just outside a hot semi-arid climate with winter temperatures just slightly cooler than would {{qualify for a}} tropical savanna climate (Aw). Years with above-average temperatures are not rare and occasionally land the city in a tropical climate.

At the other extreme, there is an average of one to two nights per year with freezing temperatures. Average monthly rainfall demonstrates a strong September maximum; the next-wettest month is October, with a slight May–June peak across the rest of the year. Generally, November through April represents a marked drier season, and Brownsville <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> weeks with minimal, even negligible, rainfall, especially over the cooler season.
