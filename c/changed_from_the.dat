It {{was developed}} for Microsoft Windows personal computers using Eclipse Entertainment's open-source game engine Genesis3D along with the Reality Factory development kit. The source code was not substantially <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original. Instead, the developers simply plugged in images and sounds that they had created in freely available editing programs.|$|E
5|$|Gump's core {{character}} and personality are also <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> novel; {{among other things}} his film character is less of an autistic savant—in the novel, while playing football at the university, he fails craft and gym, but receives a perfect score in an advanced physics class he is enrolled in by his coach to satisfy his college requirements. The novel also features Gump as an astronaut, a professional wrestler, and a chess player.|$|E

5|$|In 1930, a {{group was}} created whose {{objective}} was to channel the Senne into subterranean tunnels for nearly its entire course through the Brussels metropolitan area. This was done in order to expand the benefits that the covering achieved in the old city. In the centre, {{the course of the}} river was to be <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> central boulevards to the peripheral boulevards of the small ring. The project, delayed by war and the work being done on the North–South connection, was only finished in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Kentucky {{is one of}} {{only five}} U.S. states to hold gubernatorial {{elections}} in odd-numbered years—commonly called an off-year election. Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia, and New Jersey also hold off-year gubernatorial elections. The general election for governor and lieutenant governor is held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The governor and lieutenant governor are inaugurated on the fifth Tuesday after their election. This was <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fourth Tuesday after the election by the 1850 constitution.|$|E
5|$|Land warfare <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> static {{front lines}} of World WarI to {{increased}} mobility and combined arms. The tank, which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon. In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced {{than it had been}} during World War I, and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed, armour and firepower.|$|E

5|$|After the Hollywood {{theme was}} decided on, the design team {{drew up a}} map and {{assigned}} objects and puzzles to different areas. The game was originally designed for the ZX Spectrum and then ported to the Amstrad CPC, due to the systems' similar architecture. However, the team struggled to port the game to the Commodore 64 due to it being a different machine altogether. The finished game is significantly <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> incomplete Movieland Dizzy, which featured only film sets as locations, the surrounding film studio and backlots were not present. The real-world studio elements were added after Dizzy was disassociated from the game.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the team}} name of Eastern Michigan University <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Hurons to the Eagles in 1991, the change {{remained}} controversial as some students and alumni sought to restore it.

However, {{the return of the}} Hurons logo has prompted protests from Native Americans at the university and in the local community, who state that the old mascot promotes stereotypes and hostility.|$|E

However, with the introduction of the Champions Hockey League, this has <b>changed.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> 2015–16 season, the top 2 teams in the EIHL will participate in the CHL, with either the team who wins the post-season playoffs, or the team finishing third if the playoffs winner {{is one of the top}} two, entering the Continental Cup.|$|E

5|$|Resident Evil: Extinction began {{principal}} {{photography in}} Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico in May, 2006 after filming locations {{had to be}} <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Australian Outback to Mexico, causing production dates to be pushed back repeatedly from November 2005 to May 2006. Numerous sets were designed by production designer Eugenio Caballero including Umbrella's underground laboratory, the Las Vegas Strip, the New York-New York Hotel & Casino, Paris Las Vegas, Realto Ponte, Luxor Hotel and the replica of the Spencer Mansion. The film entered post-production in late July 2006 with details about production being kept secret and with the film's special effects being covered by Tatopoulos Studios and Mr. X Inc., whom both worked on the 2006 film Silent Hill.|$|E
5|$|The combat was {{generally}} well-received, with some reviewers noting {{that it is}} mostly unchanged from the original Knights of the Old Republic. GameSpot compared the combat from the first Knights of the Old Republic to the second, saying that it isn't well-balanced in both; however, the reviewer wrote that it helps the combat remain spontaneous. GameZone said that the combat is not <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first Knights of the Old Republic to the second, but {{that this is a}} good thing since the combat in the original was enjoyable. IGN praised the game's AI, saying that it is easy to control the main character alone without controlling the party members. GameSpy's reviewer, on the other hand, said that he encountered problems with the combat AI that were not present in the original Knights of the Old Republic.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} {{found that}} the CMF was a hollow shell of its former self, depleted in numbers and in equipment and unable to adequately fulfil its tasks. However, it still {{found that the}}re was a role for the CMF to play in the strategic environment that existed at the time, although it would no longer be called upon to provide the base upon which mobilisation {{in a time of war}} would be built, instead it would be used to augment the Regular Army. This was the first step in creating the concept of a total force, in which the differing virtues of the citizen soldier and the regular soldier would be used to complement each other, and in this vein the Millar Report recommended that the name be <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> CMF to the Australian Army Reserve.|$|E

5|$|The game is set during World War II and the {{campaign}} mode is experienced through the perspectives of four soldiers: one in the Red Army, one in the United States Army, and two in the British Army. It contains four individual campaigns, split into three stories, {{with a total of}} twenty-seven missions. Activision officially announced the game on April 7, 2005 in a press release. Many features were added and <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original Call of Duty. The most notable change is the regenerating health. Additions include an icon that indicates a nearby grenade about to explode.|$|E
5|$|The {{story behind}} the episode was {{inspired}} by several wars and occupations in the past, including the Quartering Acts and the Iraq War. Several parts of the episode <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> script, more predominantly the scenes involving a suicide bombing. The producers were worried that the Sci Fi Channel would not allow {{the inclusion of the}} scene. The episode was seen by 2.2 million viewers and attracted generally positive reactions from critics. In addition, Moore's writing of the episode was nominated for an Emmy and a Writers Guild of America award.|$|E
5|$|Various {{changes were}} made in the second edition. Some of the social {{commentary}} regarding the poor treatment of Native Americans by the government was toned down. The name of the Native tribe was <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Orteils Ficelés ("Tied Toes") to the Pieds Noirs ("Black Feet"). Perhaps because Al Capone's power had diminished in the intervening years, Hergé depicted Capone's scarred face in the 1945 version. He removed the reference to Mary Pikeford from the ceremonial dinner scene and deleted two Chinese hoodlums who tried to eat Snowy. References to Belgium were also removed, allowing the story to have a greater international appeal.|$|E
