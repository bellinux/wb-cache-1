40|$|The {{evidence}} for {{interactions between the}} ionosphere and troposphere is reviewed {{as a first step}} in establishing the role of electrical coupling between two regions. Upward processes appear to include the transfer of energy through gravity waves, or through the transmittance of VLF radio waves induced by lightning. In each case, the excitation of the upper atmosphere by tropospheric sources can stimulate feedback processes returning to the troposphere. Downward coupling involves changes in the global and local electrical structure of the atmosphere, and is often induced by solar activity. These effects are more direct and may possibly bypass the stratosphere. The responses in the atmospheric circuit to local changes are nearly instantaneous, and therefore are looked on with promise for possible influences on weather systems. Emerging experimental evidence indicates that atmospheric electric fields, especially at high latitudes and in the upper atmosphere, are responsive to solar and geomagnetic phenomena. <b>Corpuscular</b> <b>radiations</b> are known to strongly enhance the local atmospheric electrical conductivity and ionizations at stratospheric and mesospheric altitudes.

The increase in global temperature during the past 100 years is in relatively good coincidence with the increase in geomagnetic (corpuscular) activity.

40|$|The high {{sensitivity}} of the lead 210 measurement through the polonium 210 enables to date the neve layers of the Antarctic continent. Thus, appear some correlations between the concentration of lead 210 {{in the snow and}} the solar activity. The study of the atmospheric concentration of lead 210 above the oceans having proved the stratospheric origin of this nuclide in these regions, the former correlations are therefore due to a possible action of the sun’s <b>corpuscular</b> <b>radiations</b> on the stra-tosphere-troposphere transfers. 1. The interest of measuring the concentra-tion of lead 210 in various environments has been stressed by many authors and particularly in the studies made by PICCIOTO & WILGAIN (1963) and PICCIOTO, CROZAZ & DE BREUCK (1964) on the Antarctic continent neves. These authors have shown that, if the snow is suffi-ciently cold to avoid fusion phenomena, the elements contained in the ice crystals remain fixed therein. Thus, lead 210 captured by falls, under the Antarctic climatic conditions, remains fixed inside the neve layers. The measurement of its concentration decay as a function of depth, as compared to its radioactive period, makes it possible to determine the time which has been necessary for the accumulation of a given height of the neve. This method does not need such a continuous and minute marking as it is necessary for stratigraphic methods, even when they are associated with the measurement of isotopic ratios O 1 s/O 1 s; or D/H. However, it assumes the hypothesis, certainly a non-strict one, that the yearly fallout of lead 210 is con-stant. Variations in snow accumulation rate may then cause slight fluctuation on the ob-served concentrations. The difficulty of these measurements lies in the very low p radiation energy of this nuclide (0. 017 MeV). In fact, lead 210 has mostly been measured by means of its daughter product, bismuth 210, which is always in radioactive equilibrium with the lead owing to its half-lif...|$|R

Besides solar gravity, also solar electromagnetic and <b>corpuscular</b> <b>radiation,</b> and, fast interstellar gas flow are important forces influencing motion of the particles. The solar electromagnetic radiation {{is represented by the}} Poynting-Robertson effect and the solar <b>corpuscular</b> <b>radiation</b> corresponds to the solar wind. Time-variability of the non-radial solar wind can significantly increase dust lifetime in the zone. The average time for the particle stay in the zone is more than 30 -times greater than the conventional case of constant (time independent) radial solar wind offers, for the particles of tens micrometers in size. This holds for the most realistic material properties of the particles: Q̅'_pr = 1, where Q̅'_pr is the dimensionless efficiency factor for electromagnetic radiation pressure. If Q̅'_pr = 1 / 2, then the average time of the particle stay in the zone is only 4 -times the conventional value. The approach used in the paper illustrates the relevance of the solar wind action in comparison with the Poynting-Robertson effect.
