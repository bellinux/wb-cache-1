40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{this work}} is to {{determine}} the proton affinities of (deoxy) nucleoside 5 ′- and 3 ′-monophosphates (mononucleotides) using the kinetic method with fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The proton affinities of the (deoxy) nucleoside 5 ′- and 3 ′-monophosphates yielded the following trend: (deoxy) adenosine monophosphates > (deoxy) guanosine <b>monophosphates</b> > (deoxy) <b>cytidine</b> <b>monophosphates</b> ≫ deoxythymidine/uridine monophosphates. In all cases the proton affinity decreases or remains the same with the addition of the phosphate group from those values reported for nucleosides. The proton affinity is dependent on the location of the phosphate backbone (5 ′- vs. 3 ′-phosphates) : the 3 ′-monophosphates have lower proton affinities than the 5 ′-monophosphates except for the thymidine/uridine monophosphates where the trend is reversed. Molecular modeling was utilized to determine if multiple protonation sites and intramolecular hydrogen bond formation would influence the proton affinity measurements. Semiempirical calculations of the proton affinities at various locations on each mononucleotide were performed and compared to the experimental results. The possible influence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the nucleobases and the phosphate group on the measured and calculated proton affinities is discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{chemical}} {{interaction between}} DNA macromolecules and hard tissues in vertebrate is of foremost importance in paleogenetics, as bones and teeth represent a major substrate for the genetic material aftercell death. Recently, the empirical hypothesis of DNA ‘‘protection’’ over time {{thanks to its}} adsorption on hard tissues was revisited from a physico-chemical viewpoint. In particular, {{the existence of a}} stronginteraction between phosphate groups of DNA backbone and the surface of apatite nanocrystals (mimicking bone/dentin mineral) was evidenced on an experimental basis. In the field of nanomedicine, DNA orRNA can be used for gene transport into cells, and apatite nanocarriers then appear promising. In order to shed some more light on interactions between DNA molecules and apatite, the present study focuses on the adsorption of a ‘‘model’’ nucleotide, <b>cytidine</b> 50 <b>monophosphate</b> (CMP), on a carbonated biomimetic apatite sample. The follow-up of CMP kinetics of adsorption pointed out the rapidity of interaction with stabilization reached within few minutes. The adsorption isotherm could be realistically fitted to the Sipsmodel (Langmuir–Freundlich) suggesting the influence of surface heterogeneities and adsorption cooperativity in the adsorption process. The desorption study pointed out the reversible character of CMP adsorption on biomimetic apatite. This contribution is intended to prove helpful in view of better apprehending the molecular interaction of DNA fragments and apatite compounds, independently of the application domain, such as bone diagenesis or nanomedicine. This study may also appear informative for researchers interested in the origins of life on Earth and the occurrence and behavior of primitivebiomolecules...|$|R

In addition, nucleotide-coordinated Ln 3 + ions form useful nanoparticles. However, the thermodynamic basis of their interaction is still lacking. In this work, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is used to study the binding between nucleotides and 14 different Ln 3 + ions. Ln 3 + interacts mainly with the phosphate of <b>cytidine</b> and thymidine <b>monophosphate</b> (CMP and TMP), while the nucleobases in adenosine and guanosine monophosphate (AMP and GMP) are also involved. Phosphate binding is fully entropy driven since the reactions absorb heat. Nucleosides alone do not bind Ln 3 + and the purines need the phosphate for chelation. With increasing atomic number of Ln 3 +, the binding reaction with GMP goes from exothermic to endothermic. The entropy contribution starts to increase from Gd 3 +, explaining the ‘gadolinium break’ observed in many Ln 3 +-mediated RNA cleavage reactions. This study provides fundamental insights into the Ln 3 +/nucleotide interactions, and it is useful for understanding related biosensors, nanomaterials, catalysts, and for lanthanide separation.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Molecular {{genetic and}} enzymological {{techniques}} have been employed to study secondary metabolite biosynthesis. These investigations {{have focused on}} two projects: the cloning and heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters from unculturable marine organisms and the characterization of individual enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the antifungal agent blasticidin S. The marine environment {{is proving to be}} a valuable source of biologically active compounds, but problems associated with sustainable harvest, laboratory culture, and organic synthesis make obtaining sufficient quantities of compounds for drug development both difficult and expensive. A method has been developed for the isolation of biosynthetic gene clusters from complex marine microbe/invertebrate associations. Using this method a mixed polyketide synthase (PKS) and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene cluster has been cloned from the marine sponge Jaspis splendens. The cloned gene cluster was found to code for a PKS with three extension modules and an NRPS with three extension modules. In addition, several open reading frames (ORFs) were identified that may be involved in the biosynthesis of the PKS starter molecule. Partial characterization of catalytic domains from the NRPS was also completed. The second project centers on the characterization of enzymes involved in blasticidin S (BS) biosynthesis. Two ORFs were identified in the BS gene cluster encoding gene products predicted {{to be involved in the}} early steps of BS biosynthesis. The blsG gene product has sequence similarity to lysine 2, 3 -aminomutase and is believed to be involved in the formation of the β-arginine moiety of BS. A series of heterologous expression studies were undertaken to determine the function of B 1 sG. The product of blsM exhibits sequence homology with several nucleosidetransferases. blsM was cloned from the BS gene cluster, heterologously expressed in E. coli, and shown to catalyze the formation of cytosine using <b>cytidine</b> 5 '- <b>monophosphate</b> as the preferred substrate. Point mutations were introduced in blsM to generate three B 1 sM mutant enzymes: S 92 D, E 98 A, and E 98 D. All three mutants lost cytidine 5 '-monophosphate hydrolysis activity.

40|$|Cells require deoxyribonucleotides to {{synthesize}} DNA. Structurally modified precursors of deoxyribonucleotides, i. e. nucleoside analogs, {{are used as}} anti-viral and anti-cancer compounds. The deoxyribonucleosides and the nucleoside analogs are phosphorylated to the triphosphate form in three subsequent phosphorylation steps, that are catalyzed by nucleoside kinases, nucleoside monophosphate kinases and nucleoside diphosphate kinases. Five of these enzymes have been cloned and characterized in this thesis. Deoxyribonucleoside kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of deoxyribonucleosides to deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates. We have cloned and expressed the cDNA of the Drosophila melanogaster deoxyribonucleoside kinase. This enzyme showed a broader substrate specificity and higher catalytic rate compared to the human enzymes and the herpes simplex virus type- 1 thymidine kinase. The enzyme phosphorylated all four natural deoxyribonucleosides {{as well as several}} nucleoside analogs. The broad substrate specificity and high catalytic rate of Dm-dNK makes this enzyme an interesting candidate for suicide gene therapy. Two human uridine-cytidine kinases (UCK) were cloned and shown to catalyze the phosphorylation of uridine and <b>cytidine</b> to their <b>monophosphate</b> forms. UCK 1 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in twelve different human tissues, whereas human UCK 2 mRNA was detected only in placenta. The genes encoding UCK 1 and UCK 2 were mapped to chromosome 9 q 34. 2 - 9 q 34. 3 and lq 22 -lq 23. 2, respectively. We tested 28 cytidine and uridine nucleoside analogs and several of these were shown to be substrates of the enzymes. UCK 1 and UCK 2 were overexpressed in a Chinese hamster ovary cancer cell line to determine the importance of UCK mediated nucleoside analog phosphorylation. The transfected cells showed a nuclear and cytosolic location for UCK 1 and UCK 2, respectively. The UCK 1 and UCK 2 overexpressed cell line exhibited increased sensitivity to several analogs. Our data imply that UCK 1 and UCK 2 activity are ratelimiting for the efficacy of some ribonucleoside analogs in the cell line investigated. Nucleoside monophosphate kinases catalyze the second phosphorylation step, from the monophosphate to the diphosphate form. A novel human adenylate kinase, AK 5, was cloned and shown to be predominantly expressed in brain. The enzyme phosphorylated AMP and dAMP with ATP as phosphate donor. The gene that encoded this cytosolic enzyme was localized to chromosome 1 p 3 1. The cytosolic human UMPCMP kinase was cloned and characterized. The UMP-CMP kinase phosphorylated CMP, dCMP, UMP and dUMP and also the nucleoside analogs dFdC-MP, AraC-MP and ddC-MP. UMP-CMP kinase mRNA was ubiquitously present in human tissues. The human UMP-CMP kinase gene was localized to chromosome 1 p 34 1 - 1 p 33. The cloning, recombinant expression and characterization of these five nucleoside and nucleotide kinases will allow the pathways of nucleoside and nucleoside analog metabolism to be outlined in more detail. Knowledge of the metabolic pathways will be important for the development of novel ribonucleoside- and deoxyribonucleoside analogs and for the characterization of their pharmacological activation in different tissues...|$|R

50|$|The steps {{contributing}} {{to the production of}} primary transcripts involve a series of molecular interactions that initiate transcription of DNA within a cell's nucleus. Based on the needs of a given cell, certain DNA sequences are transcribed to produce a variety of RNA products to be translated into functional proteins for cellular use. To initiate the transcription process in a cell's nucleus, DNA double helices are unwound and hydrogen bonds connecting compatible nucleic acids of DNA are broken to produce two unconnected single DNA strands. One strand of the DNA template is used for transcription of the single-stranded primary transcript mRNA. This DNA strand is bound by an RNA polymerase at the promoter region of the DNA.In eukaryotes, three kinds of RNA—rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA—are produced based on the activity of three distinct RNA polymerases, whereas, in prokaryotes, only one RNA polymerase exists to create all kinds of RNA molecules. RNA polymerase II of eukaryotes transcribes the primary transcript, a transcript destined to be processed into mRNA, from the antisense DNA template in the 5' to 3' direction, and this newly synthesized primary transcript is complementary to the antisense strand of DNA. RNA polymerase II constructs the primary transcript using a set of four specific ribonucleoside monophosphate residues (Adenosine monophosphate (AMP), <b>Cytidine</b> <b>monophosphate</b> (CMP), Guanosine monophosphate (GMP), and Uridine monophosphate (UMP)) that are added continuously to the 3' hydroxyl group on the 3' end of the growing mRNA.|$|E

A purely equilibrium thermodynamic analysis gives a correct account of this behaviour and allows to simulate calorimetric curves. It is thus possible to obtain, in an indirect manner, information about the thermodynamic parameters concerning the binding process, namely the association constant and the binding enthalpy.

IspF {{is found in the}} protozoan Plasmodium falciparum, a parasite that causes cerebral malaria, as well as in many Gram-negative bacteria such as Burkholderia cenocepacia. IspF represents a potential target for development of broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs since it is proven or inferred as essential in these pathogens and absent from mammals. Structural studies of IspF from these two important yet distinct pathogens, and comparisons with orthologues have been carried out to generate reagents, to support and inform a structure-based approach to early stage drug discovery. Results: Efficient recombinant protein production and crystallization protocols were developed, and high-resolution crystal structures of IspF from P. falciparum (Pf IspF) and B. cenocepacia (Bc IspF) in complex with cytidine nucleotides determined. Comparisons with orthologues, indicate a high degree of order and conservation in parts of the active site where Zn 2 + is bound and where recognition of the cytidine moiety of substrate occurs. However, conformational flexibility is noted in that area of the active site responsible for binding th e methylerythritol component of substrate. Unexpectedly, one structure of Bc IspF revealed two molecules of <b>cytidine</b> <b>monophosphate</b> in the active site, and another identified citrate coordinating to the catalytic Zn 2 +. In both cases interactions with ligands appear to help order a flexible loop at one side of theactivesite.

We show that microcin C-like compounds carrying terminal cytosines are biologically active and target aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, and that the carboxymethyl group prevents resistance that can occur due to modification of the warhead. The results expand the repertoire of known enzymatic modifications of peptides {{that can be used to}} obtain new biological activities while avoiding or limiting bacterial resistance. status: publishe...|$|E

Objectives: To assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of nucleotides (UTP and CMP) and vitamin B 12 in patients presenting with neuralgia arising from neural compression associated with degenerative orthopedic alterations and trauma, and to compare these effects with isolated administration of vitamin B 12. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial, consisting of a 30 -day oral treatment period: Group A (n= 200) receiving nucleotides + vitamin B 12, and Group B (n= 200) receiving vitamin B 12 alone. The primary study endpoint was the percentage of subjects presenting pain visual analog scale (VAS) scores ≤ 20 at end of study treatment period. Secondary study endpoints included the percentage of subjects presenting improvement ≥ 5 points on the patient functionality questionnaire (PFQ); percentage of subjects presenting pain reduction (reduction in VAS scores at study end in relation to pretreatment); and number of subjects presenting adverse events. Results: The results of this study showed a more expressive improvement in efficacy evaluations among subjects treated with the combination of nucleotides + vitamin B 12, with a statistically significant superiority of the combination in pain reduction (evidenced by VAS scores). There were adverse events in both treatment groups, but these were transitory and no severe adverse event was recorded during the study period. Safety parameters were maintained throughout the study in both treatment groups. Conclusion: The combination of uridine, cytidine, and vitamin B 12 was safe and effective in the treatment of neuralgias arising from neural compression associated with degenerative orthopedic alterations and trauma.

40|$|Recently {{there have}} been {{developed}} various activators of the brain metabolism as therapeutic agents {{for the treatment of}} functional deficiency of the brain in residual lesions due to traumatic and vascular disturbances of the head and in geriatric mental disorders. I have investigated the effects of these agents on brain glucose metabolism, cerebral blood flow, systemic blood pressure, EEG, cerebral oxygen consumption, cerebral carbon dioxide production, cerebral lactic acid release, and cerebral glucose uptake by means of the brain perfusion and in vivo chronic administration of these agents. The agents studied were four in all; namely, 1) 5 'Cytidine monophosphate- 2 Na, 2) CDP-choline, 3) Pyrithioxin, and 4) Meclophenoxate. For the brain perfusion I used the method which has advantage of studying the direct effect of the agents on the brain tissue only without involvement in the metabolism of organs other than brain, in which the brain circulation is shunted from the systemic circulation and artificial blood of known composition is perfused. Furthermore, since the constant radioactivity through the experiments of 〔U-(14) C〕 glucose in the blood always maintained, it is easy to know its involvement in the brain metabolism. The results may briefly be summarized as follows. 1) When the brain perfusion is done with the blood containing <b>Cytidine</b> <b>monophosphate,</b> the incorporation of the blood 〔U-(14) C〕 glucose into the cerebral metabolites is enhanced as comp-ared to the perfusion of blood without <b>cytidine</b> <b>monophosphate.</b> 2) In the experiments where Pyrithioxin or Meclophenoxate is acutely administered, there can be observed no effect on the metabolic rate of the brain nor on the incorporation of blood 〔U-(14) C〕 glucose into cerebral glucose related substances. 3) There can be seen no effect of chronic administration of Pyrithioxin or Meclophenoxate on the 〔U-(14) C〕 glucose metabolism of mouse brain. 4) When the brain is perfused with the blood containing CDP-choline, the rate of incorporation of 〔U-(14) C〕 glucose (RSA) into the cerebral glucose metabolites is enhanced and it acts as to activate the brain glucose metabolism, when compared with the standard perfusion corresponding to the EEG level. 5) To the rate of cerebral blood flow, CDP-choline acts as to increase it temporarily, while Pyrithioxin or Meclophenoxate has no effect at all. 6) The systemic blood pressure is raised temporarily by Pyrithioxin or Meclophenoxate, while it is decreased temporarily by CDP-choline...|$|E
40|$|Inherited {{pyrimidine}} 5 -nucleotidase type I (P 5 N- 1) deficiency is {{the third}} most common erythrocyte enzymopathy that causes hemolysis. Fourteen different mu-tations have been identified to date. We have investigated the molecular bases of the disease by studying the biochemical properties of the recombinant wild-type human enzyme and 4 variant proteins (D 87 V, L 131 P, N 179 S, and G 230 R) bearing missense mutations found in patients af-fected by nonspherocytic hemolytic ane-mia. P 5 N- 1 is a relatively stable protein and has essentially identical catalytic effi-ciency toward <b>cytidine</b> <b>monophosphate</b> (CMP) and uridine monophosphate (UMP). All investigated mutant proteins display impaired catalytic properties and/or re-duced thermostability, providing a ratio-nale for the pathological effects of the mutations. Despite the substantial changes in the kinetic and thermostability parame-ters, the enzyme activity detected in the red blood cells of patients homozygous for mutations L 131 P and G 230 R exhibits moderate alterations. This suggests that P 5 N- 1 deficiency is compensated, possi-bly by other nucleotidases or alternative pathways in nucleotide metabolism. Therefore, nucleotidase activity may {{not be considered a}} prognostic indicator in patients affected by the enzymopathy...|$|E
40|$|Human adenoviruses {{can cause}} serious disseminated infections {{including}} death in immunosuppressed patients, especially pediatric allogeneic hemato-poietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) patients. There are no drugs approved to treat such infections. Cidofovir is used intravenously in many transplant clinics, probably with some effect, but controlled trials {{have not been}} com-pleted. Cidofovir is an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analog of <b>cytidine</b> <b>monophosphate.</b> Following conversion to its diphosphate form within cells, cidofovir is a preferred substrate for the adenovirus DNA polymerase, leading to viral DNA chain termination. Problems with cidofovir include poor cellular uptake and nephrotoxicity. Brincidofovir, a lipid-linked derivative of cidofovir which is active against five families of double-stranded DNA viruses, represents a major advance in anti-adenovirus therapy. It is administered orally, taken up readily by cells followed by release of cidofovir within cells, and is not nephrotoxic. Brincidofovir, under development by Chimerix, Inc., is being evaluated against adenovirus infections in transplant patients includ-ing allo-HSCT patients in a phase III clinical trial (AdVise Study). Preliminary results indicate that brincidofovir is safe and very effective at decreasing adenovirus viremia and adenovirus-induced pathogenicity and mortality. Anti-adenovirus adoptive T cell therapy is another very promising approach to treating allo-HSCT patients as demonstrated in clinical studies...|$|E
