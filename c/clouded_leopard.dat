5|$|The jaguar, Panthera onca, is {{the only}} extant New World member of the genus Panthera. DNA {{evidence}} shows the lion, tiger, leopard, jaguar, snow leopard, and <b>clouded</b> <b>leopard</b> share a common ancestor, and that this group is between six and ten million years old; the fossil record points {{to the emergence of}} Panthera just two to 3.8 million years ago. Phylogenetic studies generally have shown the <b>clouded</b> <b>leopard</b> (Neofelis nebulosa) is basal to this group. The position of the remaining species varies between studies and is effectively unresolved.|$|E

5|$|According to {{a survey}} in 1989â€“90, Tripura hosts 90 land mammal species from 65 genera and 10 orders, {{including}} such species as elephant (Elephas maximus), bear (Melursus ursinus), binturong (Arctictis binturong), wild dog (Cuon alpinus), porcupine (Artherurus assamensis), barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak), sambar (Cervus unicolor), wild boar (Sus scrofa), gaur (Bos gaurus), leopard (Panthera pardus), <b>clouded</b> <b>leopard</b> (Neofelis nebulosa), and many species of small cats and primates. Out of 15 free ranging primates of India, seven are found in Tripura; this is {{the highest number of}} primate species found in any Indian state. The wild buffalo (Bubalus arnee) is extinct now. There are nearly 300 species of birds in the state.|$|E
50|$|On Sumatra, Sunda <b>clouded</b> <b>leopards</b> occur most {{probably}} in much lower densities than on Borneo. One {{explanation for this}} lower density of about 1.29 individuals per 100 km2 might be that on Sumatra <b>clouded</b> <b>leopards</b> co-occur sympatrically with the tiger, whereas on Borneo <b>clouded</b> <b>leopards</b> are the largest carnivores.|$|R

40|$|<b>Clouded</b> <b>leopards</b> are a {{striking}} and elusive cat species whose secretive nature {{has made it}} difficult to gather information on population statistics and behavior in the wild, where the population is in decline. While captive populations are intended as a hedge against extinction, breeding <b>clouded</b> <b>leopards</b> ex situ has been a challenge, primarily due to extreme male aggression toward females. Despite the importance of aggression in this species, there has as yet been no systematic study characterizing the basis of aggressive episodes. Two mechanisms seem to underlie the aggressive behavior in clouded leopards: degree of anxiety and circulating testosterone levels. Three studies were conducted to characterize mechanisms modulating aggression in male <b>clouded</b> <b>leopards.</b> In Study 1, sixteen adult male <b>clouded</b> <b>leopards</b> were categorized as `anxious' or `calm' using a keeper questionnaire and fecal endocrine (androgen and glucocorticoid) profiles; these measures were correlated with behavior rates and frequencies before, during, and after a series of behavioral reaction tests aimed at assessing an individual's response to stress-inducing situations. In Study 2, the behavioral and endocrine responses to the same tests were compared in the same <b>clouded</b> <b>leopards</b> following three treatments: 1) an anxiety-reducing psychotropic drug (clomipramine, n = 4); 2) a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (deslorelin, n = 5), or 3) no treatment (n = 4). In Study 3, the long-term effects of the drug treatments on spermatogenesis and hormone concentrations were compared in <b>clouded</b> <b>leopards</b> (n = 2 /treatment) and domestic cats (n = 5 /treatment), a model for non-domestic felid reproduction. Studies revealed important findings about the basis of aggressive behavior in male <b>clouded</b> <b>leopards.</b> First, two of the behavioral reaction tests - `mirror image stimulation' and `unfamiliar people' - were effective tools for evaluating temperament and eliciting a behavioral response. Second, treatment with both clomipramine and deslorelin reduced anxious and aggressive behaviors (e. g. `tail flicking' and `growling') indicating multiple physiological mechanisms likely modulate aggression in this species. Finally, deslorelin temporarily suppressed hormone concentrations and reproductive function, while clomipramine had no clear effect on either. Ultimately, this information provides important tools for improving male-female pairing success and the overall management of captive <b>clouded</b> <b>leopards...</b>|$|R
50|$|Sunda <b>clouded</b> <b>leopards</b> are {{probably}} {{restricted to the}} islands of Borneo and Sumatra in Indonesia. In Borneo, they occur in lowland rainforest, and at lower density, in logged forest. Records in Borneo are below 1500 m. In Sumatra, {{they appear to be}} more abundant in hilly, montane areas. It is unknown if there are still Sunda <b>clouded</b> <b>leopards</b> on the small Batu Islands close to Sumatra.|$|R

500|$|A {{short and}} stocky limb {{structure}} makes the jaguar adept at climbing, crawling, and swimming. The head is robust and the jaw extremely powerful, {{it has the}} third highest bite force of all felids, after the tiger and lion. A 100kg (220lb) jaguar can bite with a force of 503.6 kgf (1110lbf) at canine teeth and 705.8 kgf (1556lbf) at carnassial notch. This strength adaptation allows the jaguar to pierce turtle shells. A comparative study of bite force adjusted for body size ranked it as the top felid, alongside the <b>clouded</b> <b>leopard</b> and ahead of the tiger and lion. It {{has been reported that}} [...] "an individual jaguar can drag an [...] bull [...] in its jaws and pulverize the heaviest bones". The jaguar hunts wild animals weighing up to 300kg (660lb) in dense jungle, and its short and sturdy physique is thus an adaptation to its prey and environment.|$|E

50|$|Early captive-breeding {{programs}} involving <b>clouded</b> <b>leopards</b> {{were not}} very successful, largely due to ignorance of courtship activity among them in the wild. Experience has taught keepers that introducing pairs of <b>clouded</b> <b>leopards</b> {{at a young age}} gives opportunities for the pair to bond and breed successfully. Males have the reputation of being aggressive towards females. Facilities breeding <b>clouded</b> <b>leopards</b> need to provide the female with a secluded, off-exhibit area. Modern breeding programs involve carefully regulated introductions between prospective mating pairs, and take into account the requirements for enriched enclosures. Stimulating natural behavior by providing adequate space to permit climbing minimizes stress. This, combined with a feeding program that fulfills the proper dietary requirements, has promoted more successful breeding in recent years.|$|R

[...] Kaziranga formally became a tiger reserve in 2006. According to Dr. Melvin Sunquist of University of Florida, who himself conducted a field study and measurement of Bengal tigers in Chitwan National Park, Nepal in the 1970s, a recent camera trap surevey inside Kaziranga National Park has revealed some very large looking tigers, in fact, the largest Bengal tigers he's ever come across.
