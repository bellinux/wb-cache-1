5|$|Kovalainen's car had {{apparently}} been fitted with mismatched tyres {{at the front of}} the car during the first stint, meaning that the tyres spun in the opposite direction to which they were designed, causing his understeer. At his first pit stop his team, not realising the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> had adjusted his front wing to compensate for the understeer and replaced the tyres correctly. This caused further handling problems, and eventually led to his retirement.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> was that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although {{it was probably the}} most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E

5|$|Media {{attention}} {{centred on}} sabotage, while other speculation ranged from clear-air turbulence to {{an explosion of}} vapour in an empty fuel tank. The Abell Committee focused on six potential aerodynamic and mechanical causes: control flutter (which had led {{to the loss of}} DH 108 prototypes), structural failure due to high loads or metal fatigue of the wing structure, failure of the powered flight controls, failure of the window panels leading to explosive decompression, or fire and other engine problems. The committee concluded that fire was the most likely <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> and a number of changes were made to the aircraft to protect the engines and wings from damage that might lead to another fire.|$|E
5|$|Complaints of {{low back}} pain {{are one of the}} most common reasons people visit doctors. For pain that has lasted only a few weeks, the pain is likely to subside on its own. Thus, if a person's medical history and {{physical}} examination do not suggest a specific disease as the cause, medical societies advise against imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. Individuals may want such tests but, unless red flags are present, they are unnecessary health care. Routine imaging increases costs, is associated with higher rates of surgery with no overall benefit, and the radiation used may be harmful to one's health. Fewer than 1% of imaging tests identify the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> Imaging may also detect harmless abnormalities, encouraging people to request further unnecessary testing or to worry. Even so, MRI scans of the lumbar region increased by more than 300% among United States Medicare beneficiaries from 1994 to 2006.|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{contacted}} Chien-Shiung Wu, {{who identified}} the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> as neutron poisoning from xenon-135, {{which has a}} half-life of 9.2 hours. Fermi, Woods, Donald J. Hughes and John Archibald Wheeler then calculated the nuclear cross section of xenon-135, {{which turned out to}} be 30,000 times that of uranium. Fortunately, DuPont engineer George Graves had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added an additional 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this overengineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium. Reactor D was started on 17 December 1944 and Reactor F on 25 February 1945.|$|E

5|$|In August 2012, oxygen {{levels in}} the river {{were found to be}} low, {{following}} the death of thousands of fish. The Environment Agency were notified and aerated the water while they investigated the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> This was thought to result from naturally occurring algae, which deplete the oxygen on which the fish depend, and may also have been affected by a reaction between hydrogen peroxide, which is used to improve oxygen {{levels in the}} water, and traces of detergent. The reaction results in an unpleasant-looking foam building up on the surface, although the foam is not hazardous. The Winsford and District Angling Association, who use the river for fishing, believe it will take many years to restore the six species of fish affected by the incident.|$|E

25|$|Madhva, {{the founder}} of the Dvaita school, another sub-school of Vedanta, on the other hand, {{believes}} that there must be a root cause for variations in karma even if karma is accepted as having no beginning and being the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of evil. Since jivas have different kinds of karma, from good to bad, all must not have started with same type of karma from the beginning of time. Thus, Madhva concludes that the jivas (souls) are not God's creation as in the Christian doctrine, but are rather entities co-existent with Vishnu, although under His absolute control. Souls are thus dependent on Him in their pristine nature and in all transformations that they may undergo.|$|E

25|$|The {{proximate}} <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> lay in Byzantium's numerous enemies, who combined {{during the}} course of the 14th century to overwhelm what remained of the empire's core territories. With each passing decade, the Byzantine Empire became weaker and lost more land. There were fewer resources available to deal with the Empire's opponents. Her power base was consequently ruined. Whilst the empire had experienced difficulties before (in the 8th century much of Byzantium's lands were occupied by Avars and Arabs), by the later 14th century the empire no longer possessed any significant territories (such as Asia Minor) to form the basis of a recovery. As a result, many attempts at driving back the Ottomans and Bulgarians failed, while the lack of territory, revenue and manpower meant that Byzantium's armies became increasingly obsolete and outnumbered.|$|E

There was no paperwork indicating that this was done, and the entire maintenance crew {{was killed in the}} crash. The number three engine and propeller were not found. The generators were found to be working, so there was sufficient electrical power to retract the landing gear. No crew members recalled hearing the landing gear motors. The switches could not be checked due to the degree of destruction of the aircraft, but the fuse was intact. It was noted that there were only six seat belts for the ten men in the forward compartment.|$|E
25|$|The main {{argument}} against the concept of reservation is that it goes against the idea of merit and would dilute the IITs {{as one of the}} basic reasons behind their success is the excellent students they get via IIT-JEE.

Also, the primary education provided by the government to the economically poor is highly inadequate, and this negligence by the government is the root <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> Statistics across the IIT's reveal that while about 4–5% of general category students do not complete their degree program, the number goes up to about 20% for reserved category students.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways used to treat loneliness, social isolation, and clinical depression. The first step that most doctors recommend to patients is therapy. Therapy is a common and effective way of treating loneliness and is often successful. Short term therapy, {{the most common form}} for lonely or depressed patients, typically occurs over a period of ten to twenty weeks. During therapy, emphasis is put on understanding the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem,</b> reversing the negative thoughts, feelings, and attitudes resulting from the problem, and exploring ways to help the patient feel connected. Some doctors also recommend group therapy as a means to connect with other sufferers and establish a support system. Doctors also frequently prescribe anti-depressants to patients as a stand-alone treatment, or in conjunction with therapy. It may take several attempts before a suitable anti-depressant medication is found. Some patients may also develop a resistance to a certain type of medication and need to switch periodically.|$|E

The planned spectacular climax to the ceremony was delayed by the technical glitch of a computer switch which malfunctioned, causing the sequence to shut down by giving a false reading.

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{incident}} CERN reported that the most likely <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> was a faulty electrical connection between two magnets, and that– due to {{the time needed to}} warm up the affected sectors and then cool them back down to operating temperature– it would take at least two months to fix. CERN released an interim technical report and preliminary analysis of the incident on 15 and 16 October 2008 respectively, and a more detailed report on 5 December 2008. The analysis of the incident by CERN confirmed that an electrical fault had indeed been the cause. The faulty electrical connection had led (correctly) to a failsafe power abort of the electrical systems powering the superconducting magnets, but had also caused an electric arc (or discharge) which damaged the integrity of the supercooled helium's enclosure and vacuum insulation, causing the coolant's temperature and pressure to rapidly rise beyond the ability of the safety systems to contain it, and leading to a temperature rise of about 100 degrees Celsius in some of the affected magnets. Energy stored in the superconducting magnets and electrical noise induced in other quench detectors also {{played a role in the}} rapid heating. Around two tonnes of liquid helium escaped explosively before detectors triggered an emergency stop, and a further four tonnes leaked at lower pressure in the aftermath. A total of 53 magnets were damaged in the incident and were repaired or replaced during the winter shutdown. This accident was thoroughly discussed in a 22February 2010 Superconductor Science and Technology article by CERN physicist Lucio Rossi.|$|E
