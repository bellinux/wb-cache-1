30|$|It is {{important}} to stress that, among the deposited lamellae, there are small voids, such as pores, cracks and regions of incomplete bonding. Due to such inhomogeneous structure, the deposits can have properties {{significantly different from the}} initial bulk materials (Fauchais 2004). In addition, due to both very high processing temperatures (leading to dehydroxylation of HA and partial decomposition of any other material) followed by rapid solidification, various admixtures and metastable phases are usually present in the deposits. For example, in the case of plasma spraying of calcium orthophosphates, complicated mixtures of various phases (high temperature ACP, α-TCP, β-TCP, HA, OA, TTCP) with other compounds, such as <b>calcium</b> pyrophosphates, <b>calcium</b> <b>metaphosphates,</b> CaO, etc. are obtained (Cao et al. 2010 a; Zyman et al. 1993; Weng et al. 1993; Zyman et al. 1994; Tong et al. 1995; McPherson et al. 1995; Yang et al. 1995; Tong et al. 1998; Park et al. 1998; Gross et al. 1998 a; Gross et al. 1998 b; Heimann and Wirth 2006; Roy et al. 2011). Thus, the chemical and phase compositions of the final coatings, films and layers are dependent on the thermal history of the powder particles. This leads to variable solubility of the deposited coatings, films and layers, dictated by the amounts of more soluble phases, such as ACP. Furthermore, the distribution of by-product and metastable phases in the coatings, films and layers appears to be inhomogeneous. For example, the coating crystallinity was reported to be lower at the interface with the Ti substrate than at the surface of the coating. This happened because metals had a higher rate of thermal diffusivity than calcium orthophosphates and, thus, the cooling rate of the first layer was faster (Gross et al. 1998 b). Besides, residual stresses in the plasma sprayed coatings, films and layers were found and measured (Valter et al. 1997; Tsui et al. 1998; Yang et al. 2000; 2003 c; Yang and Chang 2005; Carradó 2010; Yang 2011).|$|R
40|$|In an {{experiment}} {{to ascertain the}} degradability of <b>calcium</b> sodium <b>metaphosphate</b> (CSM) fiber in vitro, 32 P-labeled CSM fiber was incubated in media with or without rat lung epithelial cells (LEC) or rat alveolar macrophages (RAM).

LEC and RAM cells increased the degree of dissolution two- and sevenfold, respectively, compared to their respective media controls in a 7 -day time period. In a separate experiment, male Fischer rats were given 32 P-labeled CSM fiber either by intraperitoneal injection or by intratracheal instillation and the amount of radioactivity appearing in the urine and feces was measured over a period of 60 days.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of doping a high <b>calcium</b> oxide {{containing}} <b>metaphosphate</b> glass series (CaO) (40) (Na 2 O) (10) (P 2 O 5) (50) with TiO 2 (1, 3, and 5 mol%). TiO 2 incorporation increased the density and glass transition temperature while reduced the degradation rate (5 mol% in particular) by twofold compared with (CaO) 30 system reported previously. This has been confirmed by ion release and the minimal pH changes. TiP 2 O 7, NaCa(PO 3) (3) and CaP 2 O 6 phases were detected for all TiO 2 -containing ceramics. XPS showed that the surface is composed of Ca, h, and Ti. Ti was recognized mainly as TiO 2, but its total amount was lower than theoretical values. P- 31 magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR showed a downfield shift of the P- 31 lineshape with increasing TiO 2, interpreted as an effect of the titanium cation rather than {{an increase in the}} phosphate network connectivity. FTIR showed that incorporation of TiO 2 increased the strength of the phosphate chains, and the O/P ratio while introducing more Q(1) units into the structure {{at the expense of the}} Q(2) units. There were no differences, however, in surface topography roughness and free energies between these glasses. These results suggested that TiO 2 and CaO were acting synergistically in producing glasses with controllable bulk and structural propertie...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of the {{structural}} arrangement of the atoms in a solid is an important prerequisite to a detailed understanding of physical and chemical properties. In this work, structural investigations of phosphate (Ca-P-O) and aluminofluorophosphate (Na/Ba-Al-P-O-F) glasses with and without nitridation were performed. Nitrogen was introduced via metal nitrides (AlN, Ba₃N₂, or Ca₃N₂) or ammonia gas treatment of the melt. These glasses were characterized by chemical, thermal and optical techniques. Infrared, Raman, and MASS NMR spectroscopies {{were used to determine}} the local coordination and atomic structure of these glasses. The presence of peaks corresponding to P-O-P and PO₂ molecular vibrations in Ca-P-O glasses provided a basis for proposing a <b>calcium</b> <b>metaphosphate</b> glass structure comprised of long chains. As calcium oxide is added to <b>calcium</b> <b>metaphosphate</b> glasses, the long chains are broken up into shorter pyrophosphate units, as indicated by the presence of PO₃²⁻ terminal groups. MASS NMR of Ba-Al-P-O glasses showed that Al occurs as Al(4), Al(6), and either Al(5) or Al(6) linked through Al-O-Al bonds (such as in α-Al₂O₃). The addition of F in both the Ba-Al-P-O-F and Na-Al-P-O-F systems increases the relative abundance of Al(6). The ³¹P peak maxima in the MASS NMR spectra at about - 5 to - 10 ppm for Ba-Al-P-O-F-N glasses and - 9 to - 17 for Na-Al-P-O-F-N glass, indicate that pyrophosphate units dominate the structure of these glassy solids. Raman spectroscopy of a series of Al(PO₃) ₃-NaF glasses showed that an increase in NaF content causes a shortening of the P-O-P chains and a more disrupted structural network. The presence of P-O-F units were observed only at the higher (> 80 mole %) NaF contents. While the complexity of the Raman spectra make it difficult to confirm the presence of P-N bonding, glasses prepared in an ammonia atmosphere (nitrogen content of 1. 6 wt%) suggest the possibility of P-N bonding {{on the basis of a}} vibrational peak at 826 cm⁻¹...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. To {{develop a}} {{suitable}} scaffold for tissue-engineered bone regeneration, {{we compared the}} efficiency of tissue-engineered bone regeneration according to the porous structure of <b>calcium</b> <b>metaphosphate</b> (CMP) ceramic scaffolds. Each scaffold was prepared with a sponge method and a foam-gel method, respectively. Both scaffolds, having either interconnected trabecular pores formed by the sponge method or fully interconnected globular pores formed by the foam-based technology, were not cytotoxic and elicited neither an immune nor an inflammatory response regardless of geometry and fabrication method. The fully interconnected globular porous scaffold showed more favorable compression strength and facilitated osteogenic repair by favoring cellular attachment and osteogenic differentiation with good osteoconductivity compared to the interconnected trabecular pore structured scaffold. These {{results suggest that the}} fully interconnected globular porous structure would be more suitable for both a bone substitute and scaffold for bioactive material-based or cell-based tissue bone regeneration...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of calcium polyphosphate (CPP) were greatly affected by its polymerization degree. A series of CPP with different polymerization degree were prepared by polymerization of calcium phosphate monobasic monohydrate (MCP) at different temperatures. Polymerization degree was analyzed by liquid state 31 P {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} ( 31 P―NMR). The effect of different temperature on polymerization degree and structure of CPP was discussed. MCP was analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry―thermmogravimetry (DSC―TGA) and possible mechanism of the polymerization reaction was proposed. The results show that polymerization of MCP mainly produces CPP. When the elevation temperature is below 1000 ¡æ, polymerization degree increases; however {{the opposite is true}} when the polymerization temperature exceeds 1000 ¡æ. Additionally, the formation of a ring―structure phosphate, namely <b>calcium</b> <b>metaphosphate</b> (CMP), is also promoted with increasing polymerization temperature.

The concentrations of PDGF-AB and TGF b- 1 are measured. After PRP treated with HA and CMP, the concentrations of PDGF and TGF b- 1 are not significantly different from the concentration of them in PRP alone. The concentrations of PDGF in PRP with collagen-grafted HA and collagen-grafted CMP are significantly higher than that of PRP with HA and CMP. The concentrations of PDGF and TGF b- 1 in PRP with collagen-grafted CMP are higher than with collagen-grafted HA.

40|$|Abstract. As {{a part of}} {{the effort}} to develop a {{suitable}} scaffold for tissue-engineered bone regeneration, we modified <b>calcium</b> <b>metaphosphate</b> (CMP) ceramic with Na 20 and evaluated its efficiency as a scaffold. We incorporate 5 % Na 20 into pure CMP and prepare for an average pore size of 250 or 450 µm average pore sizes. The incorporation of 5 % Na 2 O caused reduced compressive strength and there was no change in biodegradability. The in vitro cellular attachment and proliferation rate, however, were slightly improved. The 5 % Na 2 O-incorporated macroporous CMP ceramic-cell constructs treated with Emdogain induced ectopic bone formation more effectively than those without Emdogain treatment.

40|$|Porous calcium {{phosphate}} ceramics {{are used in}} orthopedic and craniofacial applications to treat bone loss, or in dental applications to replace missing teeth. The implantation of these materials, however, does not induce stem cell differentiation, so suitable additional materials such as porous {{calcium phosphate}} discs are needed to influence physicochemical responses or structural changes. Rabbit adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) and mouse osteoblastic cells (MC 3 T 3 -E 1) were evaluated in vitro by the MTT assay, semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and immunoblotting using cells cultured in medium supplemented with extracts from bioceramics, including <b>calcium</b> <b>metaphosphate</b> (CMP), hydroxyapatite (HA) and collagen-grafted HA (HA-col). In vivo evaluation of the bone forming capacity of these bioceramics in rat models using femur defects and intramuscular implants for 12 weeks was performed. Histological analysis showed that newly formed stromal-rich tissues were observed in all the implanted regions and that the implants showed positive immunoreaction against type I collagen and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The intramuscular implant region, in particular, showed strong positive immunoreactivity for both type I collagen and ALP, which was further confirmed by mRNA expression and immunoblotting results, indicating that each bioceramic material enhanced osteogenesis stimulation.

The Ca/P ratio of the mixture was set to be 0. 50 to produce stoichiometric CMP sol. At least 5 hrs of pre-hydrolysis of phosphorus precursor were required to obtain β-CMP phase. Viscous solutions for the electrospinning {{were made by the}} mixing of CMP sol and high-molecular weight polymeric solution at various ratios.

As-electrospun CMP nanofibers were dried in a drying oven at 70 °C for 24 hrs and then heat-treated at various temperatures at a ramp of 1 °C/min in air for 1 hr. The as-electrospun and heat-treated CMP nanofibers were characterized using X-ray analysis, FT-IR, TG-DTA and SEM techniques.

The identification of crystalline phases in Na 2 O-CaO-P 2 O 5 - ZrO 2 bioglass–ceramics were detected as calcium phosphate (ß-Ca (PO 3) 2), sodium pyrophosphate (Na 4 P 2 O 7), calcium pyrophosphate (ß-Ca 2 P 2 O 7), Sodium meta phosphate (NaPO 3), Sodium <b>calcium</b> <b>metaphosphate</b> (Na 4 Ca(PO 4) 6) and sodium zirconium phosphate (Na 5 Zr(PO 4) 3) by X-ray diffraction analysis.

40|$|There {{is ongoing}} {{research}} into calcium phosphate glasses as possible candidates {{for use in}} dental restoration and {{in the field of}} bone implants. This {{is due to the fact}} that calcium phosphate glasses have many useful properties such as bioactivity, biocompatibility, bioresorbability and non toxicity. However, on the other hand they are also known to fail catastrophically and therefore cannot be used in load bearing applications and are limited as coatings to metallic substrates. Calcium phosphate glasses with different types of oxides such as magnesium, [27 - 28, 30 - 34] sodium, [14, 36 - 40] fluorine [41 - 42] in the presence of titania have been used in research to investigate whether addition of these oxides can help improve the properties of the glasses. It has been shown that calcium phosphate glasses containing fluorine have shown to produce fluoroapatite which is beneficial as it is known to be one of the ways in order to improve chemical durability of calcium phosphate glass-ceramics. [41 - 42] In the present study, type A glass and glass-ceramics demonstrated the effect of TiO 2 addition with reduction of calcium to phosphorus ratio and type B glass and glass-ceramics demonstrated the effect of TiO 2 addition with constant calcium to phosphorus ratio on the structure of fluorine containing calcium phosphate glasses and glass-ceramics. The TiO 2 addition in type A took place in 5 %, 15 % and 20 % molar content of TiO 2 and in type B, TiO 2 was added to glasses in 4. 76 %, 11. 11 %, 16. 66 % and 20 % molar content of TiO 2. FTIR, DSC, XRD, ESEM and TGA (performed only on amorphous glasses) were used to characterise the glasses and glass-ceramics produced. DSC and density measurements showed that when 15 mol % TiO 2 was added in type A; it caused disruption in the glass network which was confirmed by a reduction in the Tg. When TiO 2 was added into the glass in type B, there was a general increase in Tg observed which confirmed that TiO 2 might strengthen the glass network. XRD results showed that in both type A and type B glass-ceramics, crystal phases corresponding to <b>calcium</b> <b>metaphosphate,</b> calcium pyrophosphate and titanium pyrophosphate were present. No phase however corresponding to fluorine was found. FTIR results of type A and type B glasses showed peaks corresponding to metaphosphate, pyrophosphate and orthophosphate groups. In the FTIR spectra of both the glass-ceramics however, peaks corresponding to the metaphosphate and pyrophosphate groups were decomposed into several narrow peaks. ESEM images demonstrated the presence of different crystal phases in the glass-ceramics. Titanium pyrophosphate was seen mainly at the surface of the glass-ceramics but in the bulk of the glass-ceramics, crystals corresponding to metaphosphate and pyrophosphate were observed. TGA and EDX analysis confirmed that unfortunately only some fluorine was retained in the amorphous glass and there was no crystalline phase that contained fluorine...|$|E
