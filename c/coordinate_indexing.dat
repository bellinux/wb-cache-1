5000|$|Mortimer Taube {{also worked}} heavily with documentation, the {{literature}} {{pertaining to the}} new scientific innovation. He was a consultant and Lecturer on Scientific Documentation and was even the editor of American Documentation in the years 1952-1953. In 1952, Taube founded his own company, Documentation, Inc. with Gerald J. Sophar and two others. [...] Documentation, Inc. was the “largest aerospace information center” and did work for NASA. [...] Here Taube developed <b>Coordinate</b> <b>Indexing,</b> and important innovation {{in the field of}} Library Science. Taube defines <b>Coordinate</b> <b>Indexing</b> as, “the analysis of any field of information into a set of terms and the combination of these terms in any order to achieve any desired degree of detail in either indexing or selection." [...] <b>Coordinate</b> <b>Indexing</b> used “uniterms” to make storing and retrieving information easier and faster. [...] Uniterms “constitute a special set of rules and requirements which makes both the analysis into terms and the combination of the terms in order to specify items of information a remarkably simple and efficient process.” Taube had split <b>coordinate</b> <b>indexing</b> into two categories, item and term indexing. [...] It used punch cards and a machine reader to search for specific items or documents by terms or keywords. [...] Documentation, Inc. also brought forth the IBM 9900 Special Index Analyzer, also known as COMAC. COMAC stood for “continuous multiple access controller.” This machine handled data punch cards, used for information storage and retrieval. [...] It made “logical relationships among terms.” [...] Even though Documentation Inc. started as a small company, it soon grew to well over 700 members.|$|E

He is on {{the list}} of the 100 most {{important}} leaders in Library and Information Science of the 20th century. [...] He was important to the Library Science field because he invented <b>Coordinate</b> <b>Indexing,</b> which uses “uniterms” in the context of cataloging. It is the forerunner to computer based searches. In the early 1950s he started his own company, Documentation, Inc. with Gerald J. Sophar. Previously he worked at such institutions as the Library of Congress, the Department of Defense, and the Atomic Energy Commission. American Libraries calls him “an innovator and inventor, as well as scholar and savvy businessman.” [...] Current Biography called him the “Dewey of mid-twentieth Librarianship.” [...] Mortimer Taube was a very active man with varying interests such as tennis, philosophy, sailing, music, and collecting paintings.|$|E

Users can be offered a far greater range of possibilities, however, if documents are <b>indexed</b> with <b>coordinated</b> <b>index</b> concepts. <b>Coordinated</b> <b>index</b> concepts are compound index concepts that express a relation between concepts that function as simple subject descriptors, as in cures(headache, aspirin). We show the point by giving a functional specification of a query engine that can handle both simple and <b>coordinated</b> <b>index</b> concepts, Boolean combinations, and superconcept expansion. The Condorcet Query Engine, a prototype query engine that can be run over the World Wide Web (WWW), demonstrates the feasibility of these ideas. The combination of known and novel techniques ensures a smooth migration path from existing query engines to more advanced engines that handle <b>coordinated</b> <b>index</b> concepts...|$|R

The cards were sorted and run through a printer to produce the final result. Ohlman named this result a [...] "permutation index" [...] (or Permuterm for short) because the words went through a cyclic permutation process.The first actual permutation index was issued later that year as a subject guide to SAGE programming documents—based on 1,800 documents (2/3 from the Lincoln Laboratory).In 1958 Ohlman submitted a paper titled [...] "Subject-word letter frequencies with applications to superimposed coding" [...] to the International Conference on Scientific Information (ICSI) in Washington, DC.

40|$|More {{and more}} {{applications}} require peer-to-peer (P 2 P) systems to support complex queries over multi-dimensional data. For example, a P 2 P auction network {{for real estate}} frequently needs to answer queries such as “select five available buildings closest to the airport”. Such queries are not efficiently supported in current P 2 P systems. Towards an efficient and scalable P 2 P system capable of processing complex multi-dimensional queries, we first propose a comprehensive framework for sharing, indexing, and querying multi-dimensional data, where (i) peers with more computational power <b>coordinate</b> <b>indexing</b> and query processing, and (ii) other peers participate in part of the computation {{in order to achieve}} scalability and loadbalance. Based on this framework, we propose Network-Rtree (NR-tree), a P 2 P adaptation of the dominant spatial index- R*-tree. NR-tree, indexing spatial data at clustered peers, is capable of processing complex queries such as range queries and k-nearest neighbor queries. We propose query processing algorithms for range and k-nearest neighbor queries and experimentally prove the effectiveness of proposed techniques with real data. 1...|$|E

40|$|Indexing is a model-based {{recognition}} technique, {{in which}} unknown objects are identified using lookup tables. <b>Indexing</b> <b>coordinates</b> are extracted from sensed features, and the <b>indexing</b> <b>coordinates</b> specify a table entry containing the object's identity.

40|$|The article {{highlights}} {{a relevant}} problem of fuzzy information search in local databases. A {{choice of the}} hash signature method {{was based on the}} existing analysis of <b>coordinate</b> <b>indexing</b> methods for global search. When searching, it provides the least time characteristics. Analysis of using this method in local databases has shown {{that there are a number}} of shortcomings such as a large size of the signature index, an unjustified distribution of the alphabet symbols in groups, the uneven number of terms corresponding to one signature. Some of the shortcomings were eliminated in the course of research activities. It is shown that to eliminate the drawback of a large size of the signature index the linguistic and statistical methods of text processing can be used. This allows you to reduce the number of terms involved in the analysis, reduce the size of the index and the number of terms that correspond to one signature. A task of the fuzzy search is to search for possible errors in the query. The article draws special attention to the analysis of possible situations when there is a difference in indices of the query and the image of the term in the database in one bit. Based on the results of the theoretical analysis, it was concluded that when conducting the fuzzy search a problem of comparing bit sequences often arises. The currently implemented algorithms for bitwise index comparisons do not consider this type of tasks. In this connection, a target function to compare indices has been developed on the basis of the branch and boundary method. Note that the problem of obtaining bit sequences of terms was not considered. A theoretical analysis of the target function has shown that the optimal time and computational costs are attainable for a given set. A constraint (boundary) has been developed. It allows us reduce time costs and in many cases not compare indices of the query and the image terms completely. All the steps in the study were aimed at reducing the time and computational costs, which in the conditions of local search is relevant. In conclusion, it was noted that the target function developed by the branch and boundary method can be further investigated for the application of constraints. Also, as a direction for studying, a possible probabilistic analysis of the distribution of terms in groups for the hash signature method was chosen. </p...|$|E
