A typical pugmill consists of a horizontal boxlike chamber with a top inlet and a bottom discharge at the other end, 2 shafts with opposing paddles, and a drive assembly.

The speed of the mixer is controlled, as well as air flow to help mix the batter.

40|$|Continuous {{granular}} mixing {{provides an}} alternative to traditional batch blending operations employed by pharmaceutical, food, mining, and construction industries. For large throughput operations, continuous mixing is more economical as labor costs associated with loading, unloading, and cleaning can be reduced. Moreover, issues pertaining to process scale-up can be avoided as continuous mixers can be operated for longer durations to obtain a larger quantity of blended material. Characterization {{of the influence of}} operating conditions and material properties is necessary if the performance of a <b>continuous</b> <b>mixer</b> is to be optimized. Such parametric and optimization studies can be performed in a computational framework using modeling tools such as the discrete element method (DEM). ^ Since DEM is a computationally expensive method, large scale parametric studies using the full continuous blender geometry is not feasible. A more efficient modeling approach is to use periodic slice sub-models representing sections of the full blender. Even though inlet and outlet effects are not captured accurately using periodic slice sub-models, comparisons of flow microdynamics show that the periodic slice approach reproduces the flow inside a full blender reasonably well. ^ Using periodic slice sub-models, parametric studies investigating the influence of impeller speed, fill level, particle cohesion, and particle size in a <b>continuous</b> <b>mixer</b> are performed. The optimal mixing strategy for blending non-cohesive and cohesive particles is found to be similar, even though mixing rates for cohesive materials are generally smaller. A large impeller speed at a small fill level (small inlet feed rate) leads to fluidization of granular bed, which results in best mixing performance. Varying the size of particles has a weak influence on advective flow but strongly affects mixing rates. Mixing rates measured from periodic slice simulations are also used in the advection-diffusion equation in an attempt to develop an hybridized DEM-continuum mixing model. ^ The periodic slice approach significantly reduces simulation time when used instead of a full continuous blender DEM model. Useful information regarding flow patterns and mixing mechanisms inside a <b>continuous</b> <b>mixer</b> is obtained from periodic slice simulations {{at a fraction of the}} computation cost. Periodic slice sub-models of the continuous blender can be used to further study other parameters of interest not discussed in this work, such as mixer design and material properties of particles. The periodic slice approach described in this work may also be applicable for modeling other continuous granular operations such as continuous granulation and continuous coating. ...|$|E
40|$|Initial {{mixing of}} viscous {{immiscible}} liquids occurs by stretching and folding of large blobs {{on a global}} scale; later stages are controlled by repeated stretching, folding, breakup, and coalescence of individual filaments or drops at local or homogeneous flow scales. There is little hope of accounting for every detail as the mixing process evolves from the initial to final stages. Two models are presented: the first model (Mixing I) is suited for batch systems where decomposition into weak and strong flow regions is appropriate; the second model (Mixing II) is suited for continuous flow systems and {{is intended to be}} used in conjunction with a fluid mechanical model of the flow. The models presented here use only the most important physics of the local processes while making a connection between the overall global flow and the local dominated processes. The models calculate changes in morphology or drop size distribution due to changes in material and process parameters. Two aspects previously ignored are highlighted: formation of satellite drops upon breakup and distributions of stretching leading to wide distributions of length scales. Similar trends are obtained for both Mixing I and Mixing II models. Results indicate that there is an exponential decrease in the volume average size with time (or distance along the mixer {{in the case of a}} <b>continuous</b> <b>mixer).</b> The average drop size decreases with increase in drop viscosity or the dispersed phase viscosity and with decrease in the interfacial tension.

Encapsulation involves processing thermoplastic and waste materials into a waste form product by heating and mixing both materials into a homogeneous molten mixture. Cooling of the melt results in a solid monolithic waste form in which contaminants have been completely surrounded by a polymer matrix. Heating and mixing requirements for successful waste encapsulation can be met using proven technologies available in various types of commercial equipment. Processing techniques for thermoplastic materials, such as low density polyethylene (LDPE), are well established within the plastics industry. The majority of commercial polymer processing is accomplished using extruders, mixers or a combination of these technologies. Extruders and mixers are available in a broad range of designs and are used during the manufacture of consumer and commercial products as well as for compounding applications.

Periodic fluctuations were approximated by a Fourier Series and the amplitude reduction of rectangular periodic impulses were computed and compared with the measured amplitude reduction.
