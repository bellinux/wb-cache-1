The proposed method {{consists of a}} multi-stage classification scheme based on random forest (RF) classifier. Both low level and mid level image features are used to determine meaningful cell regions. Pixel-wise RF classification is first carried out to categorize pixels into 4 classes (dark cell, bright cell, halo artifact, and background) and generate a probability map for cell regions. K-means clustering is then applied on the probability map to group similar pixels into <b>candidate</b> <b>cell</b> regions.

However, {{there is a lack}} of study on supporting ranking queries in data warehouses where ranking is on multidimensional aggregates instead of on measures of base facts. To address this problem, we propose a query execution model to answer different types of ranking aggregate queries based on a unified, partial cube structure, ARCube. The query execution model follows a candidate generation and verification framework, where the most promising <b>candidate</b> <b>cells</b> are generated using a set of high-level guiding cells.

Initially, we performed mapping studies to identify <b>candidate</b> colony-forming <b>cells.</b> Subsequently, using a microma-nipulator, we transferred single cells individually to 35 -mm dishes for analysis of colony formation. Cellular composition of the colony was determined by identifying all of the cells in the May-Grunwald-Giemsa stained preparation. Of 150 single <b>candidate</b> <b>cells</b> replated, 63 produced colonies. The incidences of single lineage colonies included 19 erythroid, 17 monocyte-macro-phage, and 9 eosinophil colonies.

40|$|Abstract Background Genome-scale {{studies of}} {{psoriasis}} {{have been used}} to identify genes of potential relevance to disease mechanisms. For many identified genes, however, the cell type mediating disease activity is uncertain, which has limited our ability to design gene functional studies based on genomic findings. Methods We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with altered expression in psoriasis lesions (n[*]=[*] 216 patients), as well as candidate genes near susceptibility loci from psoriasis GWAS studies. These gene sets were characterized based upon their expression across 10 cell types present in psoriasis lesions. Susceptibility-associated variation at intergenic (non-coding) loci was evaluated to identify sites of allele-specific transcription factor binding. Results Half of DEGs showed highest expression in skin cells, although the dominant cell type differed between psoriasis-increased DEGs (keratinocytes, 35 %) and psoriasis-decreased DEGs (fibroblasts, 33 %). In contrast, psoriasis GWAS candidates tended to have highest expression in immune cells (71 %), with a significant fraction showing maximal expression in neutrophils (24 %, P[*]<[*] 0. 001). By identifying <b>candidate</b> <b>cell</b> types for genes near susceptibility loci, we could identify and prioritize SNPs at which susceptibility variants are predicted to influence transcription factor binding. This led to the identification of potentially causal (non-coding) SNPs for which susceptibility variants influence binding of AP- 1, NF-κB, IRF 1, STAT 3 and STAT 4. Conclusions These findings underscore the role of innate immunity in psoriasis and highlight neutrophils as a cell type linked with pathogenetic mechanisms. Assignment of <b>candidate</b> <b>cell</b> types to genes emerging from GWAS studies provides a first step towards functional analysis, and we have proposed an approach for generating hypotheses to explain GWAS hits at intergenic loci...|$|E
