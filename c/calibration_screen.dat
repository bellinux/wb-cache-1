40|$|Abstract—Vicarious <b>calibration</b> data <b>screening</b> method {{based on}} the {{measured}} atmospheric optical depth and the variance of the measured surface reflectance at the test sites is proposed. Reliability of the various calibration data has to be improved. In order to improve the reliability of the vicarious calibration data, some screenings have to be made. Through experimental study, it is found that vicarious <b>calibration</b> data <b>screening</b> would be better to apply with the measured atmospheric optical depth and variance of the measured surface reflectance due to the facts that thick atmospheric optical depth means that the atmosphere contains serious pollution sometime and that large deviation of the surface reflectance from the average means that the solar irradiance has an influence due to cirrus type of clouds. As the results of the screening, the uncertainty of vicarious calibration data from the approximated radiometric calibration coefficient is remarkably improved. Also, it is found that cross calibration uncertainty is poorer than that of vicarious calibration.

50|$|A pinscreen is a {{white screen}} {{perforated}} with thousands of pins in small holes. Light shines {{from the side of}} the screen causing each pin to cast a shadow. Each pin, being able to slide back and forth through the holes, can cast different shadows.

The pins' motion resistance depends on the pinscreen <b>calibration.</b> The white <b>screen</b> becomes darker the farther the pins are pushed out, protruding from the surface. The more the pins are pushed in less shadows are cast, the lighter the screen becomes, giving a grayish tone and eventually an all-white screen again.|$|R

We will specifically address the <b>calibration</b> and cloud <b>screening</b> issues, consider the suitability of existing satellite data sets to detecting short- and long-term regional and global changes, compare preliminary results obtained by several research groups, and discuss the prospects of creating an advanced retroactive climatology of aerosol optical thickness and size over the oceans...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of {{increasing}} attention paid to aerosols in climate studies, numerous global satellite aerosol products have been generated. Aerosol parameters and underlining physical processes are now incorporated in many general circulation models (GCMs) in order to account for their direct and indirect effects on the earth's climate, through their interactions with the energy and water cycles. There exists, however, an outstanding problem that these satellite products have substantial discrepancies, that must be lowered substantially for narrowing {{the range of the}} estimates of aerosol's climate effects. In this paper, numerous key uncertain factors in the retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD) are articulated for some widely used and relatively long satellite aerosol products including the AVHRR, TOMS, MODIS, MISR, and SeaWiFS. We systematically review the algorithms developed for these sensors in terms of four key elements that influence the quality of passive satellite aerosol retrieval: <b>calibration,</b> cloud <b>screening,</b> classification of aerosol types, and surface effects. To gain further insights into these uncertain factors, the NOAA AVHRR data are employed to conduct various tests, which help estimate the ranges of uncertainties incurred by each of the factors. At the end, recommendations are made to cope with these issues and to produce a consistent and unified aerosol database of high quality for both environment monitoring and climate studies...|$|R

Such devices have become ubiquitous in daily life and are moving into the clinical space.

Previously we have conducted such tests on the iPad 3. Here we extend our investigations to 2 other devices and outline a protocol for calibrating such screens, using standardised methods to measure the gamma function, warm up time, screen uniformity and the effects of viewing angle and screen reflections.

40|$|We present {{empirical}} calibrations that estimate stellar metallicity, {{effective temperature}} and surface gravity {{as a function}} of Lick/IDS indices. These calibrations have been derived from a training set of 261 stars for which (1) high-precision measurements of [Fe/H], T_eff and log g have been made using spectral-synthesis analysis of HIRES spectra, and (2) Lick indices have also been measured. Our [Fe/H] calibration, which has precision 0. 07 dex, has identified a number of bright (V < 9) metal-rich stars which are now being screened for hot Jupiter-type planets. Using the Yonsei-Yale stellar models, we show that the calibrations provide distance estimates accurate to 20 % for nearby stars.

40|$|Introduction: In this study, we reviewuated and {{compared}} three routine methods for {{the measurement of}} urinary protein concentrations {{with a view to}} find a suitable method to prevent, diagnose and monitor renal disease under circumstances with limited resources. Materials and Methods: Two modifications of the Trichoroacetic acid (TCA) turbidimetric method read at 405 and 620 nm and the sulfosalicylic acid (SSA) turbidimetric method were considered. The reviewuated was carried out using a variety of control materials, calibrators and patients urine samples. Results: The result indicated that the TCA method read at 405 nm is appropriate for the measurement of protein in the range of 25 - 700 mg/L and the TCA " 620 nm method" is appropriate for the measurement of protein concentration in the range of 100 - 1000 mg/L. Of the two methods, the TCA at 405 nm was minimally influenced by the type of calibrator. The SSA method showed unacceptable performance in the measurement of protein, specially at lower concentration, in addition the results showed a large variation {{depending on the type of}} <b>calibration.</b> Conclusion: For <b>screening</b> of high-risk populations e. g. diabetics and early diagnosis of microproteinuria the recommended method is the TCA at 405 nm calibrated with a serum-based mixed Albumin/Globulin standard. For routine testing the TCA method at 620 is suggested regardless of type of calibration, although the limitations at lower concentrations should be remembered...|$|R
40|$|Metamodeling of {{large-scale}} simulations {{consisting of a}} large number of input parameters can be very challenging. Neural Networks have shown great promise in fitting these large-scale simulations even without performing factor screening. However, factor screening is an effective method for logically re-ducing the dimensionality of an input space and thus enabling more feasible metamodel <b>calibration.</b> Ap-plying factor <b>screening</b> methods before calibrating Neural Network metamodels or any metamodel can have both positive and negative effects. The critical assumption for factor screening under investigation involves the prevalence of two-way interactions that contain a variable without a significant main effect by itself. In a simulation with a large parameter space, the prevalence of two-way interactions and their contribution to the total variability in the model output is far from transparent. Important questions there-fore arise regarding factor screening and Neural Network metamodels: (a) is this a process worth doing with today’s more powerful computing processors, which provide a larger library of runs to do metamod-eling; and (b), does erroneously screening these buried interaction terms critically impact the level of metamodel fidelity that one can achieve. In this paper we examine these questions through the construc-tion of a case study on a large-scale simulation. This study projects regional homelessness levels per county of interest based on a large array of budget decisions and resource allocations that expand out to hundreds of input parameters. ...|$|R
40|$|Mg-Ca carbonates are an {{important}} group of industrial minerals, which frequently occur intimately intermixed in natural settings and are traditionally assessed for phase purity by X‑ray diffraction (XRD). In this study Raman spectroscopy is employed to quantify the modal abundance of hydromagnesite [Mg 5 (CO 3) 4 (OH) 2 · 4 H 2 O], huntite [CaMg 3 (CO 3) 4], dolomite [MgCa(CO 3) 2], and magnesite [MgCO 3], in powdered mixtures constructed from fabricated reference materials. Particle size distributions were assessed by scanning electron microscopy and laser diffraction. Raman analyses performed using a portable instrument were conducted at 25 °C and at atmospheric pressure. XRD was employed to validate the accuracy and precision of Raman measurements. Monovariable and multivariable methods were employed to provide quaternary quantification from the spectroscopic data. For monovariable calibration the amplitude of the peaks was plotted against the measured weight ratios of the four mineral phases. Overlapping bands were resolved using the Gaussian Lorentzian method. Chemometric methods were used to perform the multivariable calibration. The overall lowest error on component values was obtained by principal component regression with application of standard normal variate correction. The quantifications derived by Raman spectroscopy and XRD show close agreement. Hence, evidence suggests that a reliable four-way <b>calibration</b> program to <b>screen</b> the purity of carbonate assemblages can be constructed, providing particle size effects are constrained and spectroscopic operating conditions are uniform...|$|R

For this deployment our primary result was columnar water vapor (CWV) obtained from continuous solar transmittance measurements in the 0. 94 -micron band. In addition, we simultaneously measured aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 380, 450, 525, 864 and 1020 nm. During the IOP, preliminary results of CWV and AOD were displayed in real-time.

Determination of resource quality attributes using current laboratory methods is both timely and costly. This study tested visible and near-infrared (wavelengths from 0. 35 2. 50 ?m) reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) for rapid prediction of quality attributes for a diverse range of organic resources. A spectral library was constructed for 319 samples of oven-dried, ground plant material originating from green leaf (186 samples), litter (33), root (25), and stem (21) samples from 83 species including tropical crops and trees used for agroforestry and manure samples (39). Organic resource attributes were calibrated to first-derivative reflectance using regression trees with stochastic gradient boosting, and screening tests were developed for separating various organic resource quality classes using classification trees. Validation r 2 values for actual vs. predicted values using a 25 % holdout sample were 0. 91 for N, 0. 90 for total soluble polyphenol, and 0. 64 for lignin concentration. Screening tests gave validation prediction efficiencies of 96 % for detecting samples with high N concentration, 91 % for low total soluble polyphenol, and 86 % for low lignin concentration.

This study shows the results of shikimic acid accumulation in Brachiaria plantaginea, an abundant, grassy plant found in Brazil and other countries in Africa and America, after glyphosate spraying at three different doses. B. plantaginea plants harvested after 6 days {{of exposure to the}} herbicide showed that shikimic acid accumulation increased by 345 %, on average, compared to unsprayed plants. The combination of near infrared spectroscopy and multivariate analysis using partial least square regression was applied for the quantification of shikimic acid in B. plantaginea. Spectra of 44 samples were obtained using the diffuse reflectance mode in the range of 4000 to 10000 cm- 1 with 4 cm- 1 resolution. Different mathematical pretreatments were applied to the spectra. As preprocessing, the data were mean-centered. The calibration model with seven factors on twenty-nine samples (training set) exhibited a coefficient of determination = 0. 9930 and a standard error of calibration = 84. 05. For external validation (11 samples on the test set), the coefficient of determination = 0. 9317 and the standard error of prediction = 154. 91. The percent calibration error range was 1 to 10 % for most of the samples and only two samples presented an error greater than 20 %.

40|$|An {{atmospheric}} pressure chemical ionization source {{has been used}} to enhance the potential of gas chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometry (MS) for screening and quantification purposes in pesticide residue analysis. A screening method developed in our laboratory for around 130 pesticides has been applied to fruit and vegetable samples, including strawberries, oranges, apples, carrots, lettuces, courgettes, red peppers, and tomatoes. Samples were analyzed together with quality control samples (at 0. 05 mg/kg) for each matrix and for matrix-matched <b>calibration</b> standards. The <b>screening</b> strategy consisted in first rapid searching and detection, and then a refined identification step using the QTOF capabilities (MSE and accurate mass). Identification was based on the presence of one characteristic m/z ion (Q) obtained with the low collision energy function and at least one fragment ion (q) obtained with the high collision energy function, both with mass errors of less than 5 ppm, and an ion intensity ratio (q/Q) within the tolerances permitted. Following this strategy, 15 of 130 pesticides were identified in the samples. Afterwards, the quantitation capabilities were tested by performing a quantitative validation for those pesticides detected in the samples. To this aim, five matrices were selected (orange, apple, tomato, lettuce, and carrot) and spiked at two concentrations (0. 01 and 0. 1 mg/kg), and quantification was done using matrix-matched calibration standards (relative responses versus triphenyl phosphate used as an internal standard). Acceptable average recoveries and relative standard deviations were obtained for many but not all pesticide–matrix combinations. These figures allowed us to perform a retrospective quantification of positives found in the screening without the need for additional analysis. Taking advantage of the accurate-mass full-spectrum data provided by QTOF MS, we searched for a higher number of compounds (up to 416 pesticides) in a second stage by performing extra data processing without any new sample injection. Several more pesticides were detected, confirmed, and/or tentatively identified when the reference standard was unavailable, illustrating in this way the potential of gas chromatography–QTOF MS to detect pesticides in addition to the ones targeted in quantitative analysis of pesticides in food matrices...|$|R
