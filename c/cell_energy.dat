25|$|The {{group of}} algae {{known as the}} diatoms {{synthesize}} their cell walls (also known as frustules or valves) from silicic acid (specifically orthosilicic acid, H4SiO4). The acid is polymerised intra-cellularly, then the wall is extruded to protect the cell. Significantly, relative to the organic cell walls produced by other groups, silica frustules require less energy to synthesize (approximately 8%), potentially a major saving on the overall <b>cell</b> <b>energy</b> budget and possibly an explanation for higher growth rates in diatoms.|$|E
25|$|Solar cell {{efficiencies}} {{vary from}} 6% for amorphous silicon-based solar cells to 44.0% with multiple-junction concentrated photovoltaics. Solar <b>cell</b> <b>energy</b> conversion efficiencies for commercially available photovoltaics are around 14–22%. Concentrated photovoltaics (CPV) may reduce cost by concentrating up to 1,000 suns (through magnifying lens) onto a smaller sized photovoltaic cell. However, such {{concentrated solar power}} requires sophisticated heat sink designs, otherwise the photovoltaic cell overheats, which reduces its efficiency and life. To further exacerbate the concentrated cooling design, the heat sink must be passive, otherwise the power required for active cooling would reduce the overall efficiency and economy.|$|E

25|$|Solar cell {{efficiencies}} {{vary from}} 6% for amorphous silicon-based solar cells to 44.0% with multiple-junction production cells and 44.4% with multiple dies assembled into a hybrid package. Solar <b>cell</b> <b>energy</b> conversion efficiencies for commercially available multicrystalline Si solar cells are around 14-19%. The highest efficiency cells {{have not always}} been the most economical — for example a 30% efficient multijunction cell based on exotic materials such as gallium arsenide or indium selenide produced at low volume might well cost one hundred times as much as an 8% efficient amorphous silicon cell in mass production, while delivering only about four times the output.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of silicon}} by diatoms is {{believed}} by many researchers {{to be the}} key to their ecological success. In a now classic study, Egge and Aksnes (1992) found that diatom dominance of mesocosm communities was directly related to the availability of silicic acid — when concentrations were greater than 2 µmol m−3, they found that diatoms typically represented more than 70% of the phytoplankton community. Raven (1983) noted that, relative to organic cell walls, silica frustules require less energy to synthesize (approximately 8% of a comparable organic wall), potentially a significant saving on the overall <b>cell</b> <b>energy</b> budget. Other researchers have suggested that the biogenic silica in diatom cell walls acts as an effective pH buffering agent, facilitating the conversion of bicarbonate to dissolved CO2 (which is more readily assimilated). Notwithstanding the possible advantages conferred by silicon, diatoms typically have higher growth rates than other algae of a corresponding size.|$|E
2500|$|AMPK is {{regulated}} allosterically mostly by competitive binding on its gamma subunit between ATP (which allows phosphatase access to T172) and AMP or ADP (each of which blocks access to phosphatases). [...] It also appears that AMPK is a sensor of AMP/ATP or ADP/ATP ratios and thus <b>cell</b> <b>energy</b> level. Regulation of AMPK by CaMKK2 requires a direct interaction {{of these two}} proteins via their kinase domains. The interaction of CaMKK2 with AMPK only involves the alpha and beta subunits of AMPK (AMPK gamma is absent from the CaMKK2 complex), thus rendering regulation of AMPK in this context to changes in calcium levels but not AMP or ADP.|$|E

2500|$|The Buteyko {{method is}} based on the concept that [...] "hidden" [...] or undiagnosed {{hyperventilation}} is the underlying cause of numerous medical conditions, including asthma. [...] It is known that hyperventilation can lead to low carbon dioxide levels in the blood (or hypocapnea), which can subsequently lead to disturbances of the acid-base balance in the blood and lower tissue oxygen levels. [...] Advocates of this method believe that the effects of chronic hyperventilation would have even wider effects than is commonly accepted. [...] These effects include widespread spasms of the muscle in the airways (bronchospasm), disturbance of <b>cell</b> <b>energy</b> production via the Krebs cycle, as well as disturbance of numerous vital homeostatic chemical reactions in the body. [...] The Buteyko method is a purported method of [...] "retraining" [...] the body's breathing pattern to correct for the presumed chronic hyperventilation and hypocapnea, and thereby treat or cure the body of these medical problems.|$|E

5000|$|The {{regulation}} of 1-phosphofructokinase occurs primarily by allosteric effectors, {{and is based}} on the <b>cell's</b> <b>energy</b> needs. There are two ATP binding sites; a substrate site where the phosphate transfer occurs, and an allosteric site where allosteric regulation occurs. ATP acts as an allosteric inhibitor and when cellular concentrations of ATP are high, and the <b>cell's</b> <b>energy</b> needs are low, the reaction catalyzed by 1-phosphofructokinase is inhibited. When the cell is actively consuming ATP and stores deplete, the concentration of ATP lowers while the concentrations of AMP and ADP increase. AMP and ADP are both positive effectors of 1-phosphofructokinase and bind allosterically to activate the reaction. This activation encourages glycolysis and ATP production. [...] Inhibition can also occur via citrate, a product of glycolysis and intermediate in the citric acid cycle. An increased concentration of citrate indicates the cell is meeting current energy needs, and therefore encourages allosteric inhibition of 1-phosphofructokinase allosterically via ATP.|$|R

NASA GRC, in conjunction with JPL and JSC, is leading efforts to develop High Energy and Ultra High <b>Energy</b> <b>cells</b> for three primary Constellation customers: Altair, Extravehicular Activities (EVA), and Lunar Surface Systems. The objective of the High <b>Energy</b> <b>cell</b> development is to enable a battery system that can operationally deliver approximately 150 Wh/kg for 2000 cycles. The Ultra High <b>Energy</b> <b>cell</b> development will enable a battery system that can operationally deliver 220 Wh/kg for 200 cycles. To accomplish these goals, cathode, electrolyte, separator, and safety components are being developed for High <b>Energy</b> <b>Cells.</b> The Ultra High <b>Energy</b> <b>cell</b> development adds lithium alloy anodes to the component development portfolio to enable much higher cell-level specific energy. The Ultra High <b>Energy</b> <b>cell</b> development is targeted for the ascent stage of Altair, which is the Lunar Lander, and for power for the Portable Life support System of the EVA Lunar spacesuit.
