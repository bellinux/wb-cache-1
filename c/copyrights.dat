25|$|Australian <b>copyright</b> law has {{historically}} been influenced by British <b>copyright</b> law and International <b>copyright</b> agreements.

5|$|Despite the {{settlement}} recognising {{his claim to}} Morley's music patent, Barley seemingly {{found it difficult to}} enforce his rights, even with his new role as a stationer. Less than half of the known music books published from 1606 to 1613 recognised Barley's rights on the imprint. Barley took Thomas Adams to the Stationers' court in 1609, challenging the <b>copyrights</b> of the music books Adams had published.

40|$|This Essay {{studies the}} effect of Eldred v. Ashcroft on the {{treatment}} of aggressive <b>copyright</b> claims. Aggressive <b>copyright</b> claims test the boundaries of <b>copyright</b> by urging courts to adopt unconventional or novel readings of doctrine that would extend <b>copyright</b> well beyond its core of preventing individuals from reproducing the <b>copyrighted</b> works of others. Accordingly, aggressive <b>copyright</b> claims are often made against defendants who have done more than simply "parrot" a <b>copyrighted</b> work. These defendants have generally added meaningful work of their own, whether {{in the form of}} comment and criticism, significant reworking of the plaintiff's material, or new material unrelated to the <b>copyrighted</b> work. At their most extreme, aggressive <b>copyright</b> claims assert that almost any borrowing from a <b>copyrighted</b> work constitutes actionable infringement. Aggressive <b>copyright</b> claims are interesting because they illustrate the tension between <b>copyright</b> and the First Amendment. A defendant who combines original speech with material borrowed from a <b>copyrighted</b> source may commit infringement, but {{this does not mean that}} no free speech problems exist. <b>Copyright</b> judgments generally include injunctions that effectively prevent the defendant from publishing or disseminating any original speech contained in the infringing work. Aggressive <b>copyright</b> claims often raise significant First Amendment problems because they tend to be brought against defendants whose alleged infringements contain a significant amount of new speech. Unfortunately, courts have been overly receptive to aggressive <b>copyright</b> claims, at least in part because conventional wisdom states that courts can safely ignore First Amendment concerns in <b>copyright</b> because <b>copyright</b> doctrine somehow "naturally" takes account of First Amendment values. The Essay criticizes this conventional wisdom because it supports the success of aggressive <b>copyright</b> claims that do little to advance <b>copyright's</b> fundamental purposes. It goes on to argue that conventional wisdom must be changed, and that the Supreme Court has begun this process by recognizing the First Amendment's importance to <b>copyright</b> in the Eldred opinion. The Essay concludes by showing how proper recognition of the First Amendment in <b>copyright</b> affects the treatment of aggressive <b>copyright</b> claims. intellectual property law, <b>copyright</b> claims, Eldred v.
