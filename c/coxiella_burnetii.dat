He was also involved in two projects that were not viral, the characterisation of the causative agents of psittacosis and Q fever. After finding that parrots and cockatoos were infected with psittacosis and were responsible for transmission, he lobbied the government for a ban {{in order to prevent}} human infection, but he was rebuffed and later came to agree with the government position that there was not much danger. During the time he worked on Q fever with Australian scientist E.H. Derrick, the causative organism of which was named <b>Coxiella</b> <b>burnetii</b> in Burnet's honour, he became the first person to acquire the disease in the laboratory.

40|$|Q fever is {{a disease}} that can be {{transmitted}} from animals to humans. This zoonotic disease {{is caused by the}} bacterium <b>Coxiella</b> (C.) <b>burnetii.</b> Signs of the disease may appear as slight flu-like symptoms, but also as high fever, accompanied by strong head and muscle aches. It can also occur as pneumonia and other severe disease processes. In the Netherlands, coin-ciding with infection in dairy goat herds an increase of Q fever cases in humans was re-ported. The causative agent, <b>Coxiella</b> (C.) <b>burnetii,</b> was not only found in animals such as goats, sheep and cattle, but also in foods of animal origin such as raw milk, raw milk cheese, butter from raw milk and the meat of infected animals. The risk for humans to contract Q-fever from contaminated food, was estimated in a previously published preliminary opinion from the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) of June 17 th 2003. Humans are infected with <b>Coxiella</b> (C.) <b>burnetii</b> primarily by inhaling dust and droplets through the respiratory tract. This assumption is also confirmed by more recent publications. The risk of contracting a food-borne infection with Q fever is still assessed as low. However, infection from food sources is not completely ruled out and still under discussion. The causative agent of Q fever is now well detected using molecular biological methods such as PCR from raw milk samples as template. However, these methods do not differentiate between viable and dead pathogens present in the food matrices. For other matrices such as cheese or meat, there is still no routine detection method available. As preventive measure, BfR generally recommends a heat treatment of milk obtained from infected herds.

40|$|Abstract Background Current {{epidemiological}} {{data on the}} situation of <b>Coxiella</b> (C.) <b>burnetii</b> infections in sheep are missing, making risk assessment and the implementation of counteractive measures difficult. Using the German state of Thuringia as a model example, the estimated sero-, and antigen prevalence of C. burnetii (10 % and 25 %, respectively) was assessed at flock level in 39 / 252 randomly selected clinically healthy sheep flocks with more than 100 ewes and unknown abortion rate. Results The CHECKIT™ Q-fever Test Kit identified 11 (28 %) antibody positive herds, whereas real-time PCR revealed the presence of C. burnetii DNA in 2 (5 %) of the flocks. Multiple-locus variable number of tandem repeats analysis of 9 isolates obtained from one flock revealed identical profiles. All isolates contained the plasmid QpH 1. Conclusions The results demonstrate that C. burnetii is present in clinically inconspicuous sheep flocks and sporadic flare-ups do occur as the notifications to the German animal disease reporting system show. Although C. burnetii infections are not a primary veterinary concern {{due to the lack}} of significant clinical impact on animal health (with the exception of goats), the eminent zoonotic risk for humans should not be underestimated. Therefore, strategies combining the interests of public and veterinary public health should include monitoring of flocks, the identification and culling of shedders as well as the administration of protective vaccines. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRuminants are {{the main}} source of human infections with the obligate {{intracellular}} bacterium <b>Coxiella</b> (C.) <b>burnetii.</b> Infected animals shed high numbers of C. burnetii by milk, feces, and birth products. In goats, shedding by the latter route coincides with C. burnetii replication in epithelial (trophoblast) cells of the placenta, which led us to hypothesize that epithelial cells are generally implicated in replication and shedding of C. burnetii. We therefore aimed at analyzing the interactions of C. burnetii with epithelial cells of the bovine host (1) at the entry site (lung epithelium) which govern host immune responses and (2) in epithelial cells of gut, udder and placenta decisive for the quantity of pathogen excretion. Epithelial cell lines [PS (udder), FKD-R 971 (small intestine), BCEC (maternal placenta), F 3 (fetal placenta), BEL- 26 (lung) ] were inoculated with C. burnetii strains Nine Mile I (NMI) and NMII at different cultivation conditions. The cell lines exhibited different permissiveness for C. burnetii. While maintaining cell viability, udder cells allowed the highest replication rates with formation of large cell-filling Coxiella containing vacuoles. Intestinal cells showed an enhanced susceptibility to invasion but supported C. burnetii replication only at intermediate levels. Lung and placental cells also internalized the bacteria but in strikingly smaller numbers. In any of the epithelial cells, both Coxiella strains failed to trigger a substantial IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and TNF-α response. Epithelial cells, with mammary epithelial cells in particular, may therefore serve as a niche for C. burnetii replication in vivo without alerting the host’s immune response...|$|R
40|$|Most human Q fever infections {{originate}} from small ruminants. By contrast, highly prevalent shedding of <b>Coxiella</b> (C.) <b>burnetii</b> by bovine milk rarely results in human disease. We hypothesized that primary bovine and human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) represent a suitable in vitro {{model for the}} identification of strain-specific virulence properties at the cellular level. Twelve different C. burnetii strains were selected to represent different host species and multiple loci variable number of tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) genotypes. Infection efficiency and replication of C. burnetii were monitored by cell culture re-titration and qPCR. Expression of immunoregulatory factors after MDM infection was measured by qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. Invasion, replication and MDM response differed between C. burnetii strains but not between MDMs of the two hosts. Strains isolated from ruminants were less well internalized than isolates from humans and rodents. Internalization of MLVA group I strains was lower compared to other genogroups. Replication efficacy of C. burnetii in MDM ranged from low (MLVA group III) to high (MLVA group IV). Infected human and bovine MDM responded with a principal up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL- 1 β, IL- 12, and TNF-α. However, MLVA group IV strains induced a pronounced host response whereas infection with group I strains resulted in a milder response. C. burnetii infection marginally affected polarization of MDM. Only one C. burnetii strain of MLVA group IV caused a substantial up-regulation of activation markers (CD 40, CD 80) {{on the surface of}} bovine and human MDM. The study showed that replication of C. burnetii in MDM and the subsequent host cell response is genotype-specific rather than being determined by the host species pointing to a clear distinction in C. burnetii virulence between the genetic groups...|$|R

40|$|The recent Q fever {{epidemic}} in the Netherlands {{raised concerns about}} the potential risk of outbreaks in other European countries. In Switzerland, the prevalence of Q fever in animals and humans has not been studied in recent years. In this study, we describe the current situation with respect to <b>Coxiella</b> (C.) <b>burnetii</b> infections in small ruminants and humans in Switzerland, {{as a basis for}} future epidemiological investigations and public health risk assessments. Specific objectives of this cross-sectional study were to (i) estimate the seroprevalence of C.  burnetii in sheep and goats, (ii) quantify the amount of bacteria shed during abortion and (iii) analyse temporal trends in human C.  burnetii infections. The seroprevalence of C.  burnetii in small ruminants was determined by commercial ELISA from a representative sample of 100 sheep flocks and 72 goat herds. Herd-level seroprevalence was 5. 0 % (95 % CI: 1. 6 - 11. 3) for sheep and 11. 1 % (95 % CI: 4. 9 - 20. 7) for goats. Animal-level seroprevalence was 1. 8 % (95 % CI: 0. 8 - 3. 4) for sheep and 3. 4 % (95 % CI: 1. 7 - 6) for goats. The quantification of C.  burnetii in 97 ovine and caprine abortion samples by real-time PCR indicated shedding of > 10 (4) bacteria/g in 13. 4 % of all samples tested. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting C.  burnetii quantities in a large number of small ruminant abortion samples. Annual human Q fever serology data were provided by five major Swiss laboratories. Overall, seroprevalence in humans ranged between 1. 7 % and 3. 5 % from 2007 to 2011, and no temporal trends were observed. Interestingly, the two laboratories with significantly higher seroprevalences are located in the regions with the largest goat populations as well as, for one laboratory, with the highest livestock density in Switzerland. However, a direct link between animal and human infection data could not be established in this study...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} mixed species {{exhibits}} increasingly becomes important in European zoos. Nowadays, {{they are a}} common type of exhibitry, especially for ungulates. In zoological gardens and precisely in mixed exhibits, different types of species live in close direct and indirect contact with each other. There {{are a series of}} infectious agents that can be transmitted between them. Depending on the infected species, these infectious agents might possess a different degree of pathogenicity. Especially herpesviruses are often apathogenic for the natural host but may cause serious disease in other species. In the present study, the rate of exposure of bovids, cervids, and camelids against such infectious agents was analysed. Therefore, eleven zoological institutions with a preferably high number of mixed species exhibits and a high number of ungulates were choosed: Berlin Zoo, Berlin Tierpark Friedrichsfelde, Dortmund Zoo, Dvúr Králové Zoo (Czech Republic), Gelsenkirchen Zoo, Hagenbeck Tierpark, Hamburg, Hannover Zoo, Karlsruhe Zoo, Leipzig Zoo, Tiergarten Nürnberg and the Wilhelma Zoological-botanical Garden, Stuttgart. The infectious agents were selected for the following criteria: (1) They should be transmissible between different ungulate species. (2) They should be relevant for zoo ungulates. In order to find out the relevance of infectious agents for zoo ungulates, {{the first part of the}} study included a retrospective overview of the archived veterinary data from 1998 to 2004 of all zoological gardens. It was found out that in the last six years the main emphasis was placed on the diagnosis of Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (M. pt.), <b>Coxiella</b> (C.) <b>burnetii</b> and Clamydophila (C.) psittaci and that Chlamydia and Coxiella (resp. specific antibodies) were detected the most often. In the second part of the study, a total of 926 blood samples were tested by means of Virus Neutralisation Test or by ELISA for the presence of antibodies against selected infectious agents. Specific antibodies could be detected against all eight agents. The seroprevalences were as follows: 1, 5 % (14 / 926) for Bovine Herpesvirus 1 (BHV- 1); 0, 2 % (2 / 926) for Caprine Herpesvirus 1 (CHV- 1); 0, 2 % (2 / 926) for Cervid Herpesvirus 1 (HVC- 1); 21, 2 % (180 / 850) for Malignant Catarrhal Fever Virus (BKFV); 1, 4 % (13 / 926) for Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV); 19, 6 % (165 / 843) for C. psittaci; 0, 1 % (1 / 754) for C. burnetii; 2, 8 % (19 / 667) for M. pt. The results revealed the following:  The prevalence of antibodies against both Alpha Herpesviruses (BHV- 1, CHV- 1, HVC- 1) and BVDV is less than 3 % (n= 926). This means that zoo ungulates are currently not exposed to a significant degree to these infectious agents.  The prevalence of antibodies against MCFV is 21 % (n= 850) and is highest in the subfamily caprinae (54 %; n= 219). This means that zoo ungulates are exposed to a significant degree to MCFV and that especially sheep and goats might be a source of MCF infection for susceptible species.  The prevalence of antibodies against C. psittaci is 20 % (n= 843) and is highest in the family camelidae (32 %; n= 74). This means that zoo ungulates are exposed to a significant degree to C. psittaci and that especially camelids might be a source of C. psittaci infection for susceptible species.  The prevalence of antibodies against C. burnetii and M. pt. is less than 3 % (n= 754 resp. 667). However, due to the limited available diagnostic tools for exotic ungulates we can not affirm their actual state of infection. Particularly animals infected with M. pt. remain seronegative until an advanced state of infection. Therefore, we can not define the risk of exposure of zoo ungulates against C. burnetii and M. pt. In addition to the taxonomy (family, subfamily, species), age, sex, and origin of the animals, the influence of the following factors on the rate of exposure against infectious agents were examined: Type of husbandry (single species exhibit, different types of mixed species exhibits, petting zoo), exhibit size, population density, and season. Evidence suggests that both exhibit type and population density have an important influence on the seroprevalence against MCFV. The highest seroprevalence was found in petting exhibits (61 %; n= 66) and in exhibits with a high population density (less than 45 m² per animal) (50 %; n= 109). The seroprevalence against C. psittaci showed no major differences between the different exhibit types. Based on the results of this study, the following conclusions have been reached: Infectious agents that can be transmitted between different cohabitant species do also spread across different enclosures. The risk of interspecies transmission between animals of a mixed species exhibit is not higher than between animals of different exhibits of the same zoological collection. Therefore each zoological garden should be regarded and treated as one single epidemiological unit...|$|R

2500|$|Pasteurization is a {{sanitation}} {{process in}} which milk is heated briefly to a temperature high enough to kill pathogens, followed by rapid cooling. While different times and temperatures may be used by different processors, pasteurization is most commonly achieved with heating to 161 degrees Fahrenheit (71.7 degrees Celsius) for 15 seconds. Milk is tested following pasteurization to confirm that bacteria have been killed to an acceptable level. Pasteurization kills pathogenic bacteria which occasionally may be present in milk, including those causing tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), listeriosis (Listeria monocytogenes), Q fever (<b>Coxiella</b> <b>burnetii),</b> brucellosis (Brucella), campylobacteriosis (Campylobacter), salmonellosis (Salmonella), and several other foodborne illnesses (e.g., [...] ).
