50|$|Will Rogers World Airport {{recorded}} {{an estimated}} 11.6 inches of snow, smashing the all-time daily snowfall {{record for the}} month of February for Oklahoma City (the previous record was 6.5 inches on February 7, 1986). Tulsa also set an all-time snowfall record for the storm for February 1 and the month of February, as the Tulsa International Airport received 14 inches of accumulated snowfall (the previous February snowfall record for the city of Tulsa was 10.5 inches in February 2003, and the previous record for snowfall in a single 24-hour period in Tulsa was 12.9 inches on March 8-9, 1994).Owasso, Oklahoma received the most snowfall accumulation in Oklahoma with 21 inches. Ironically days earlier on January 29, wildfires had burned parts of central and south-central Oklahoma, and ten central and south-central Oklahoma counties were placed under a burn ban due to very dry, wildfire-prone conditions. State Insurance Commissioner John Doak issued an emergency order to allow licensed <b>claims</b> <b>adjustors</b> outside of Oklahoma to help assess damages and losses from the storm for 90 days. On February 2, Governor Fallin asked the White House to approve an emergency disaster declaration request for all 77 Oklahoma counties. In a statement by Fallin, state and local governments would receive 75% reimbursement for expenses associated with responding to the storm if the declaration is approved, including overtime costs, costs associated with operating shelters and clearing snow and ice-covered roads. That evening, President Barack Obama granted Fallin's federal emergency request, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA to coordinate disaster relief efforts in the state of Oklahoma.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} which factors are most influential to farmers' crop insurance purchasing decisions in northern Illinois. Design/methodology/approach – A mail survey method was used to collect information from farmers in a 42 county region of Illinois. Findings – Of the factors analyzed, price had the most significant effect on crop insurance purchase decisions. While acres farmed had statistically significant impact on most of the crop insurance purchase decisions, different factors played a role in purchase decisions based on types of insurance and types of crops covered. Research limitations/implications – The results of this study warrant additional research relative to crop insurance purchase decisions. Analyzing the affect of varying degrees of government subsidization across crop insurance plans and coverage levels on purchase decisions is recommended. Questions regarding the relationship between crop insurance subsidization, farm program payments, and ad hoc disaster payments would be relevant in light of World Trade Organization and federal budget discussions. Also, asking participants to indicate if they have a written grain marketing plan and if that plan leverages crop insurance coverage to support forward contracting or pre-harvest pricing would provide additional insights in determining how crop insurance purchase decisions are made. Questions regarding the claims process should be incorporated into future studies on this topic. The timeliness of claims payments, as well as the farmer's level of satisfaction with the <b>claims</b> <b>adjustor</b> and <b>claims</b> process may factor into the decision-making process. Practical implications – Illinois farmers and crop insurance agencies could benefit from this study. Findings could improve the crop insurance products and services available to Illinois farmers and make the federal crop insurance program more effective in enhancing farmers' ability to manage crop production risk. Originality/value – This paper identified the factors that are most influential to farmers' crop insurance purchasing decisions in northern Illinois.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} secure the policyholders against losses due to {{earthquakes}} that are common natural calamities in Taiwan, the government launched a residential earthquake insurance system several years ago. Policyholders can be indemnified by total loss claim for quake-related losses of property. Despite {{there are many other}} professionals involved in the assessment procedure for total loss <b>claim,</b> the qualified <b>adjustors</b> from underwriters are pivotal to the assessment of total loss <b>claims.</b> The qualified <b>adjustors</b> are personnel of non-life insurance companies that underwent training courses for earthquake building damage assessment {{and many of them are}} not professionals in civil engineering. Their determination of total loss claims are based on claim standard operation procedure (SOP) established by Taiwan Residential Earthquake Insurance Fund (TREIF) and mainly relies on personal experience and knowledge of earthquake building damages. Furthermore, considering that reinforced concrete buildings account for more than 76 % effective policies in Taiwan, a quantified loss model for total loss claim determination for RC buildings has been developed in 2009. In this paper, we developed an information system based on the quantified loss model and claims SOP that includes a total loss claim determination system (TLCDS) for qualified adjustors of insurance companies and a centralized database management system (TLDBMS) for TREIF. Claims handling procedure, related forms and the quantified model for determining total loss claims are discussed in the paper. It is believed the proposed information system will be helpful to enhance the efficiency and quality of damage assessment and total loss claim handling operation...|$|R
