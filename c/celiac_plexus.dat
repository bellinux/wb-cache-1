40|$|Median arcuate {{ligament}} syndrome (MALS) {{is a rare}} disorder {{resulting from}} extrinsic compression and narrowing of the celiac artery, and—less often—the superior mesenteric artery, by the relatively low insertion of the ligament and/or prominent fibrous bands or ganglionic periaortic tissue of the <b>celiac</b> nervous <b>plexus.</b> We report on {{a young woman who}} after three consecutive attempts of endovascular therapy with balloon angioplasty and stenting for MALS, each followed by gross symptom recurrence and a cumulative weight loss of 10 kg, underwent open surgical division of the ligament and reconstruction of the celiac artery. Despite the initial response of MALS to endovascular therapy, the extrinsic pressure exerted on the celiac artery by the surrounding dense fibrous/ganglionic tissue resulted in slippage of the stents and/or failure of their material. These findings militate against the use of balloon angioplasty and stenting primarily in patients with MALS without prior release of the extrinsic compression on the celiac (and/or superior mesenteric) artery by dividing the surrounding median arcuate ligament and/or ganglionic tissue with open or laparoscopic surgery...|$|R
40|$|Endothelin (ET) type B receptors (ETBR) are {{expressed}} in multiple tissues and perform different functions depending on their location. ETBR mediate endothelium-dependent vasodilation, clearance of circulating ET, and diuretic effects; all of these should produce a fall in arterial blood pressure. However, we recently showed that chronic activation of ETBR in rats with the selective agonist sarafotoxin 6 c (S 6 c) causes sustained hypertension. We have proposed that one mechanism of this effect is constriction of capacitance vessels. The current study was performed to determine whether S 6 c hypertension is caused by increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or activation of the sympathetic nervous system. The model used was continuous 5 -day infusion of S 6 c into male Sprague-Dawley rats. No changes in superoxide anion levels in arteries and veins were found in hypertensive S 6 c-treated rats. However, superoxide levels were increased in sympathetic ganglia from S 6 c-treated rats. In addition, superoxide levels in ganglia increased progressively the longer the animals received S 6 c. Treatment with the antioxidant tempol impaired S 6 c-induced hypertension and decreased superoxide levels in ganglia. Acute ganglion blockade lowered blood pressure more in S 6 c-treated rats than in vehicle-treated rats. Although plasma norepinephrine levels were not increased in S 6 c hypertension, surgical ablation of the <b>celiac</b> ganglion <b>plexus,</b> which provides most of the sympathetic innervation to the splanchnic organs, significantly attenuated hypertension development. The results suggest that S 6 c-induced hypertension is partially mediated by sympathoexcitation to the splanchnic organs driven by increased oxidative stress in prevertebral sympathetic ganglia...|$|R
40|$|Background. Management of {{branch duct}} type IPMNs (BD-IPMNs) largely relies on imaging finding. In {{particular}} Sendai guidelines propose surgical treatment in symptomatic BD- IPMNs or asymptomatic lesions with a diameter > 3 cm, in presence of mural nodules or Wirsung caliber > 6 mm. The International Consensus guidelines published in 2012 still suggest a conservative approach, even for lesion larger than 3 cm, without other imaging findings of malignancy, removing the recommendation for surgical resection based on size alone. However, these indications have been strongly challenged by recent {{studies showing that}} small BD-IPMNs could be associated with malignancy; moreover surgical BD-IPMN treatment is confined to lesions evolved to invasive cancer, losing {{the possibility of a}} preventive therapeutic approach, especially in younger patients (< 65 years). Our study aims to recognize CT signs predictive of evolution to malignancy in BD-IPMN. Our study aims to recognize CT signs predictive of evolution to malignancy in BD-IPMN. Methods and materials. We included 43 patients affected by BD-IPMN. For each patient we evaluated the first and the last CT exams performed in the follow-up (mean follow-up period: 37 months, range: 18 months- 7 years). Post-contrastographic CT study included the pancreatic (35 ”), venous (70 ”) and late (180 ”) phases. The following CT parameters were examined: localization, morfology (unilocular/multilocular), Wirsung caliber, baseline attenuation, parietal and septal enhancement, neural <b>plexus</b> (<b>celiac</b> and AMS) and celiac ganglia involvement, size of the main cystic lesion. Results. In 26 patients no significant changes in CT findings were found (confirmed by imaging follow-up). Other 17 were submitted to surgical resection because of clinical symptoms or CT signs suggestive for malignant degeneration, that was confirmed at pathology in 16 cases (10 / 16 with a diameter 5 mm (p< 0, 0001), perineural <b>plexus</b> and <b>celiac</b> ganglia involvement (p< 0, 0001). No correlation was found considering lesion dimension (p= 0. 4644). Conclusions. Even if current guidelines propose follow-up in asymptomatic BD-IPMNs less than 3 cm (or 4 cm) in diameter, the event of malignant degeneration in small lesion has been described, suggesting the need of considering further imaging parameters predictive of malignancy...|$|R

40|$|Pancreatic {{cancer has}} a very poor {{prognosis}} resulting {{in the death of}} 98 % of patients. Pain may be severe and difficult to treat. Management of pain includes chemotherapy, radiotherapy, pharmacologic treatment, and neurolytic <b>celiac</b> <b>plexus</b> block. Recent reviews of the efficacy of neurolytic <b>celiac</b> <b>plexus</b> block however, have reached conflicting conclusions.

In 12 patients, a neurolytic <b>celiac</b> <b>plexus</b> block with alcohol, administered via an indwelling celiac catheter, was performed. To evaluate the efficacy, visual analog scale scores were recorded every day. Quality of life scores were registered before and 4 weeks following the procedure. Alterations in opioid consumption, and the time between the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and the performance of the block, were registered. All patients were followed until they died. Two patients remained without pain after the first neurolytic <b>celiac</b> <b>plexus</b> block. In all other patients a second block was administered which provided only temporary relief. Additional intermittent administration of bupivacaine through the catheter was necessary to provide adequate pain relief in these patients. Quality of life increased significantly during the treatment. Opioid consumption decreased significantly in all patients.

40|$|Neurolytic <b>celiac</b> <b>plexus</b> {{block is}} a {{recognised}} treatment for visceral abdominal pain due to malignancy. The {{need for a}} diagnostic <b>celiac</b> <b>plexus</b> block prior to neurolytic blockade is of questionable value, as it may not predict a positive response and may incorrectly predict a lack of response. Our objective is to evaluate the efficacy of diagnostic <b>celiac</b> <b>plexus</b> block. The records of 59 patients treated with <b>celiac</b> <b>plexus</b> block during 1994 - 2000 were retrospectively reviewed. Diagnostic block was performed on 32 patients prior to the decision for subsequent neurolytic block (Group 1). Another 27 patients were directly treated with a neurolytic <b>celiac</b> <b>plexus</b> block (Group 2). Response of Group 1 to diagnostic and neurolytic blocks was compared. Data from Group 2 was used to project the response of Group 1 should those patients with negative response to diagnostic block proceeded to neurolytic block. A two-by-two table was then constructed. The diagnostic <b>celiac</b> <b>plexus</b> block predicted a positive response with a sensitivity of 93 % and a specificity of 37 %. The positive predictive value was 85 % and the negative predictive value was 58 %. The estimated 'number needed to test' before a 'true' nonrespondent to lytic block to be detected was 16. 7. Therefore, a positive response to diagnostic block correlates positively with neurolytic <b>celiac</b> <b>plexus</b> block for abdominal visceral pain due to malignancy. However, diagnostic block is a poor predictor when the response is negative. Hence, its clinical role is questionable {{and may not be}} warranted for patients with terminal malignancy. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
