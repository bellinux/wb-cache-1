40|$|Paper No. 37 Extensive {{research}} has been performed previously on assessing the out-of-plane (OOP) performance of unreinforced masonry (URM) walls and retrofitting URM load-bearing and infill walls for OOP capacity. However, little {{research has}} been performed within New Zealand pertaining to clay brick masonry walls with cavities, despite their prominence in the building population. Hence, further research was pursued with an emphasis on retrofitting URM cavity walls so as to form composite behaviour efficiently. This research was based on an experimental testing approach wherein walls were loaded OOP using inflatable air bags. Testing was performed on ten URM cavity walls in two separate buildings. The intended outcomes of the research reported herein were as follows: Determine the behaviour of cavity walls in vertical flexure when bordered by rigid moment-resisting reinforced concrete (RC) frames; Determine the improvement in drift levels in cavity walls prior to loss in strength and prior to collapse, using a variety of <b>cavity</b> wall <b>ties</b> at different spacings; Determine which <b>cavity</b> <b>ties</b> are most effective in improving OOP cavity wall performance; Determine how the load-based capacities of the test walls correspond to design basis earthquake demands in Auckland (area of moderate seismicity) and in Hastings, New Zealand (area of high seismicity); and Determine what effective solid wall thickness should be assumed for cavity walls with various retrofit ties conditions for use in existing models regarding the OOP flexure of URM wallsKevin Walsh, Dmytro Dizhur, Jalil Shafaei, Hossein Derakhshan and Jason Ingha...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{research}} has been performed previously on assessing the out-of-plane (OOP) seismic performance of unreinforced clay brick masonry (URM) walls and the retrofitting of URM load-bearing and infill walls having a solid wall thickness. However, comparatively little {{research has}} been performed pertaining to URM walls with cavities (i. e., continuous air gaps separating wythes of brick from one another), despite the prominence of cavity masonry construction {{in various parts of the}} world. Hence, research was pursued with an emphasis on efficiently retrofitting URM cavity walls to enable the formation of composite behavior when subjected to simulated seismic OOP loading. The research reported herein was based on an experimental testing approach wherein walls were loaded OOP using inflatable airbags. Ten tests total were performed on nine separate URM cavity wall panels located in two separate buildings. The intended outcomes of the research reported herein included determining the OOP behavior of cavity walls in one-way vertical flexure both when bordered and not bordered by rigid moment-resisting reinforced concrete frames; to quantify the improvement in drift levels of cavity walls prior to loss in strength and prior to collapse using a variety of <b>cavity</b> wall <b>ties</b> at different spacing; to establish an effective solid wall thickness for cavity walls with various retrofit tie conditions for use in existing OOP predictive models; and to estimate how the semi-composite action generated by the retrofitting of cavity walls with stiff <b>cavity</b> <b>ties</b> may be predicted.

50|$|This is an {{increasing}} problem with <b>cavity</b> wall <b>ties</b> made from galvanised steel. It arises when the galvanising is not of sufficient quality and the outer leaf of the cavity wall allows water penetration, usually due to porous brick/blockwork. If the tie rusts, the swelling effect may cause horizontal, external cracks {{to appear in the}} wall. Frost action can swiftly enlarge these cracks to cause damage.|$|R
40|$|Brick and Block Masonry - Trends, Innovations and ChallengesThe seismic {{vulnerability}} of unreinforced masonry (URM) walls to out-of-plane loading is widely acknowledged. Much {{research has been}} undertaken to develop practical techniques to provide ade-quate flexural strength for these URM walls which are often {{an integral part of}} the gravity load resisting struc-ture. In solid URM walls, the surface treatments that provide tensile capacity to the wall have been shown to be very effective flexural retrofit techniques. Cavity wall construction, on the other hand, has received little attention and surface treatments are not possible to the inner faces of the two leaves of construction. This pa-per presents the results of preliminary tests of two techniques with the aim of enabling near surface mounted FRP reinforcement on the external faces of unreinforced clay brick cavity walls to work under full reverse cy-clic loading. In these experiments, one system used expanding foam in the cavity to maintain the cavity di-mension and prevent the <b>cavity</b> <b>ties</b> from buckling under compression forces and the second system investi-gated the use of heavier duty metal connecters that could withstand the compression forces without buckling.

40|$|Background: The Hartmann {{procedure}} {{is a standard}} life-saving operation for acute left colonic complications. It is usually performed as a temporary procedure {{with the intent to}} reverse it later on. This reversal is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality by open method. The laparoscopic reestablishment of intestinal continuity after Hartmann procedure has shown better results in terms of decrease in morbidity and mortality. Materials and Methods: The laparoscopic technique was used consecutively in 12 patients for the reversal of Hartmann procedure in the last 3 years. The adhesiolysis and mobilization of the colon was done under laparoscopic guidance. The colostomy was mobilized and returned to abdominal <b>cavity</b> after <b>tying</b> the anvil in the proximal end. An end-to-end intracorporeal anastomosis was performed between the proximal colon and the rectum using the circular stapler. Results: Mean age of the patients was 40 years and the mean time of restoration of intestinal continuity was 130 days. Two patients were converted to open. The mean time of operation was 90 min. There were no postoperative complications and mortality. The mean hospital stay was 5 days. Conclusion: Laparoscopic reversal of Hartmann is technically safe and feasible...|$|R
50|$|Because the masonry veneer is non-structural, {{it must be}} {{tied back}} to the {{building}} structure to prevent movement under wind and earthquake loads. This is usually accomplished by a means that does not interrupt the drainage plane and does not compromise <b>cavity</b> insulation. Brick <b>ties</b> are used for this purpose, and may {{take the form of}} corrugated metal straps nailed or screwed to the structural framing, or as wire extensions to horizontal joint reinforcement in a fully masonry veneer system. Although the veneer is vertically self-supporting, shelf angles are often used in multi-story buildings, typically at floor edges, to provide a horizontal expansion joint that allows expansion of the brick and potential shrinkage of the frame. In multi-story buildings, such a system may be called a curtain wall.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Fatigue S-N {{relations}} are investigated experimentally on the grade B cast steel for Chinese railway freight car bogie frames. Group test method was employed. Results {{reveal that the}} fatigue cracks were initiated from the material cast shrinking <b>cavities</b> with hot <b>ties.</b> Distinct fatigue striations, river-like flowers, and second cracks appeared on the fracture surface in perpendicular to the fatigue crack path. Lots of dimples in the transient fracture district indicate that present material is ductile. Considering both the scattered S-N relations and no fatigue limits under variable loads, the S-N {{relations are}} measured probabilistically in terms of continuous declined probabilistic S-N curves including super-long life regime (SLLR) of> 107 cycles. Affordable novel approach, i. e. concurrent probability extrapolation method, was applied. The test S-N data in mid-long life regime (MLLR) and conventional fatigue limits are used. The curves are established by extrapolating the conventional S-N curves crossing the fatigue limits, in a concurrent probability manner, into the SLLR. Appropriate measurements have been given for the test data of the present material...|$|R
40|$|The {{wood duck}} is North America’s most widely {{distributed}} endemic species, {{and most of}} its wintering and breeding range falls within the 48 contiguous states (Fig. 1). The wood duck inhabits forested wetlands and, because of its need for nest <b>cavities,</b> is closely <b>tied</b> to North America’s remaining forest resources. Habitat destruction, market hunting, and liberal hunting seasons contributed to drastic declines and, in some cases, regional eradication of local wood duck populations. Subsequent implementation of hunting restrictions and the high reproductive rate of the species are responsible for the recovery of wood duck populations to current stable levels. As prairie duck populations continue to decline, hunting pressure on the wood duck continues to increase. The wood duck is popular with hunters and consistently ranks high among species in Atlantic and Mississippi flyway duck harvests. Harvest pressure and continued degradation of riparian and lowland hardwood forests increases the need for a thorough understanding of wood duck population dynamics. Equally important to sustaining current wood duck population levels is an understanding of annual life cycle events and requirements...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of both cavity and veneer wall systems is critically dependant on the effective {{performance of}} the ties which connect the outer and inner leaves. In veneer construction the ties are the principal means of support of the external masonry leaf as they transfer the veneer loads to the structural back-up frame. In <b>cavity</b> construction, the <b>ties</b> allow the sharing of load between the two masonry leaves, with the tie forces being influenced by the relative stiffness of the leaves {{and the nature of}} the support for each leaf. In recent years there have been attempts to model this behaviour analytically with varying degrees of sophistication. These studies have shown that the distribution of forces in the ties is dependant on a range of factors, with the tie force certainly not just being a function of the tributary loading area for the tie. The Masonry Research Group at the University of Newcastle is involved in an on-going study of wall tie behaviour with a view to developing more realistic wall tie design rules. Some results on the behaviour of <b>ties</b> in <b>cavity</b> walls have been presented previously. This paper reports a study on typical Australian brick veneer walling systems which has concentrated on developing techniques to accurately monitor individual tie forces in veneer walls subjected to lateral loads. A convenient method for measuring individual tie forces is presented, together with confirmation that tie force redistribution occurs in veneer systems once ties reach their individual capacity...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of Adaptive Shock Control Bumps (SCB) {{presented in this}} work {{is a result of}} an investigation into transonic flow control devices. The primary application is on transonic passenger jet aircraft during cruise and within supersonic intakes. It is in these locations that normal shocks of strength Mach 1. 2 - 1. 5 typically occur which SCB aim to manipulate and exploit. The original concept was developed by [Ashill et al., 1992] featured a flexible plate with actuators beneath the surface. The complex fluid-structure interaction (FSI) between the shock and plate has been a focus of this work with panel flutter studies heavily supplementing traditional SCB design methods. Adaptive SCB represent a required approach in order to negate poor off-design performance of static SCB. A coupled 2 D aero-structural solver was developed using OpenFOAM [2017] and ABAQUS [2007] which provides a tool to evaluate the effects of varying plate proper- <b>ties.</b> <b>Cavity</b> pressure, plate length, thickness and material stiffness were found to be influential in the overall performance with four test cases developed. With lengths, lb = 150 − 200 mm and thicknesses t = 0. 4 − 0. 6 mm using Al- 7075 -T 6, experimental models were produced and tested in a Mach 1. 4 blowdown supersonic wind tunnel. These were sized using the coupled solver to deform passively and trigger the bifurca- tion of the shock. This new type of device showed potential for a passive adaptive SCB however all suffered from varying amounts of reacceleration over the rear surface. An aero-structural optimisation procedure is performed to position displacement con- straints beneath the flexible plate to control surface curvature. This was {{the driving force behind the}} detrimental reacceleration. The optimiser used a new performance metric which focussed upon smearing the adverse pressure gradient across the SCB which reduced the likelihood of plastic deformation. Optimal SCB have been shown to deploy and retract beneath an unsteady shock and successfully bifurcated the shock on demand. Open Acces...|$|R
