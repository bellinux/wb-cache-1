5000|$|The name <b>cuckoo</b> <b>wrasse</b> {{comes from}} Cornish {{fishermen}} who associated the blue markings with bluebell flowers. In the Cornish language, a bluebell is bleujenn an gog, literally [...] "the cuckoo flower".|$|E

50|$|The Porcupine Abyssal Plain {{which has}} an average depth of 4,774 m is on the {{continental}} margin southwest of Ireland. It is the habitat for many deep sea fish and was first investigated in the summers of 1868 and 1869 by Charles Wyville Thomsons H.M.S. Porcupine expedition. Other notable fish include the basking shark, ocean sunfish, conger eel, hagfish, boarfish (Capros aper), large-eyed rabbitfish, lumpsucker, <b>cuckoo</b> <b>wrasse,</b> and the thresher shark.|$|E

50|$|The <b>cuckoo</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Labrus mixtus) is {{a species}} of wrasse native to the eastern Atlantic Ocean from Norway to Senegal, {{including}} the Azores and Madeira. It {{is also found in}} the Mediterranean Sea. They can be found amongst the algae on rocky shores at depths from 2 to 200 m, though mostly between 40 and 80 m. This species is an important food fish for local populations and is also popular as a game fish. It is also a popular fish for display in public aquaria.|$|E
40|$|The <b>cuckoo</b> <b>wrasse,</b> Labrus mixtus, {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in the moderate warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean, including the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas. Generally, labrids are small inshore coastal species susceptible to anthropogenic habitat degradation and, although without commercial importance, they make up {{a significant part of}} the by-catch and discard. Also, these fishes are intensively caught in recreational and subsistence fisheries. Basic biological information is required for their stock assessment and conservation. Studies of the age, growth, reproduction and feeding of L. mixtus have not been undertaken previously in the Adriatic Sea. The observed maximum age of the <b>cuckoo</b> <b>wrasse</b> was 10 years, although most of the sampled fish were 7 years old. The estimated parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth model suggested that the growth of L. mixtus was relatively fast in the first four years of life. L. mixtus is a protogynous hermaphrodite and sex change occurred at 26 cm, while the greatest increase in gonadosomatic index in April confirmed spring as the spawning period. The <b>cuckoo</b> <b>wrasse</b> is an opportunistic predator, feeding primarily on crustaceans, gastropods and fishes. The information provided on biological indices is necessary for life history pathways and future conservation measures of this population in the Adriatic Sea...|$|E
40|$|In {{aquarium}} and {{sea cage}} experiments four wrasse species from Norwegian waters {{were identified as}} facultative cleaners, with lice infested salmon (Salmo salar) as the host: goldsinny (Ctenblabrus rupestris), rock cook (Centrolabrus exoletus), female <b>cuckoo</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Labrus ossifagus) and corkwing wrasse Crenilabrus melops). In this assumingly artificial cleaning symbiosis the wrasses played the active role while the salmon showed little response, neither aggressiveness nor invitation to cleaning. Experiments in sea cages have shown that wrasse might be utilized to control sea lice infestation on salmon postsmolts, {{as an alternative to}} treatment with chemicals...|$|E
