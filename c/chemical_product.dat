25|$|Solubility is a {{property}} of interest in many aspects of science, including but not limited to: environmental predictions, biochemistry, pharmacy, drug-design, agrochemical design, and protein ligand binding. Aqueous solubility is of fundamental interest owing to the vital biological and transportation functions played by water. In addition, to this clear scientific interest in water solubility and solvent effects; accurate predictions of solubility are important industrially. The ability to accurately predict a molecules solubility represents potentially large financial savings in many <b>chemical</b> <b>product</b> development processes, such as pharmaceuticals. In the pharmaceutical industry, solubility predictions form part of the early stage lead optimisation process of drug candidates. Solubility remains a concern {{all the way to}} formulation. A number of methods have been applied to such predictions including quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSAR), quantitative structure–property relationships (QSPR) and data mining. These models provide efficient predictions of solubility and represent the current standard. The draw back such models is that they can lack physical insight. A method founded in physical theory, capable of achieving similar levels of accuracy at an sensible cost, would be a powerful tool scientifically and industrially.|$|E

2500|$|Section 8 of the Act covers {{reporting}} requirements. All employers must {{report to}} OSHA within eight hours if an employee dies from a work-related incident, {{or three or}} more employees are hospitalized {{as a result of}} a work-related incident. Additionally, all fatal on-the-job heart attacks must also be reported. Section 8 permits OSHA inspectors to enter, inspect and investigate, during regular working hours, any workplace covered by the Act. Employers must also communicate with employees about hazards in the workplace. By regulation, OSHA requires that employers keep a record of every non-consumer <b>chemical</b> <b>product</b> used in the workplace. Detailed technical bulletins called material safety data sheets (MSDSs) must be posted and available for employees to read and use to avoid chemical hazards. OSHA also requires employers to report on every injury or job-related illness requiring medical treatment (other than first aid) on OSHA Form 300, [...] "Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses" [...] (known as an [...] "OSHA Log" [...] or [...] "Form 300"). An annual summary is also required and must be posted for three months, and records must be kept for at least five years.|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} about <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> from {{the construction industry}} which are {{being used by the}} company Bostads AB Mimer (Mimer), owned by the municipality Västerås in Sweden. The company owns apartments and houses around the city. The aim of this bachelor thesis is to do a simplified risk assessment of the <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> from a health and  environmental point. The report also gives suggestions of substitutional products. The thesis work consists of a literature study, an analysis of how other companies within the housing sector are working with <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> and a case study, in addition to the simplified risk assessment. The case study contains a selection of Mimer's <b>chemical</b> <b>products.</b> In order to succeed with the simplified risk assessment, the <b>chemical</b> <b>product’s</b> risks and hazards has been identified through safety data sheets (SDS). Different aspects have been taken into account in the simplified risk assessment. The selection of the <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> were made after existence frequency and legislative product labeling. The report's results gave 16 selected <b>chemical</b> <b>products,</b> that are risk assessed. Of the 16 <b>chemical</b> <b>products,</b> eight products have a high risk score from a heath point. Suggestions of less hazardous <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> are given to nine <b>chemical</b> <b>products.</b> The essay's conclusions are that some of the selected <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> are hazardous to the health and the environment, due to their chemical substances. The staff at Mimer's has a high frequency of use of the <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> in general. Most of the other companies in the housing sector that  were investigated in the analysis, had a systematic work on chemicals...|$|R

The use of the other single <b>chemical</b> <b>products</b> is also correlated to the performance of the treatment process, where, for example the better the quality of the final product (i.e. treated/filtered water), the lower the cost with the rest of the <b>chemical</b> <b>products,</b> namely hexafluorosilicic acid, chlorine and calcium oxide.|$|R
