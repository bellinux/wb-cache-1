The primary focus is on the amount of cash in the bank, and the secondary focus is on making sure all bills are paid. Little effort is made to match revenues to the time period in which they are earned, or to match expenses to the time period in which they are incurred.

Following the announcement, the Accountants General Department (AGD) of Malaysia has been appointed as the agency to head and responsible for the implementation of accrual accounting system in the public sector. The shift from <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accounting</b> to accrual accounting represents the fiscal management change in the Malaysian public sector. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} transition process from <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accounting</b> to full adoption of accrual accounting was not easy. Countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada and United Kingdom took a long period of time to fully adopt the accrual accounting system. The Malaysian government however, has directed the agency to complete the full adoption of accrual accounting system within a period of only 8 years. In order to ensure the implementation success of the accrual accounting system, there is a need to examine the acceptance level of accrual accounting system among the personnel in the public sector. This study examines the acceptance level of accrual accounting system among public sector accounting personnel. Subsequently, this study examines whether the acceptance level of accrual accounting system among the public sector accounting personnel influence their motivation, job satisfaction and job performance. This study found that the public sector accounting personnel are ready for accrual accounting due to the high rate of acceptance level among them. This study also shows that the acceptance of accrual accounting system among the public sector accounting personnel significantly influences their motivation, job satisfaction and job performance. Further analyses show that employees' motivation has significant influence on job satisfaction and job performance. The results in this study indicates that acceptance of a technology leads to positive attitude among the public sector accounting personnel and this consequently influence their motivation, job satisfaction and job performance.

50|$|There {{are certain}} {{advantages}} in tax planning when the cash method of accounting is used: for instance, payment of business expenses may be accelerated before year end, {{in order to}} maximize tax deductions, whereas billings for services may be postponed to after year end, so that payments won't be received until the new year, thus postponing tax payments on such income. Because of these advantages and the manipulations that can occur with it in order to minimize taxable income, the IRS has discouraged (although not prohibited entirely) the <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> of <b>accounting</b> for tax purposes. For instance the companies that use the <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> of <b>accounting</b> may not report any inventory in their financial statements, in fact reporting of any inventory at year end can lead to manipulation of taxable income to an enormous extent.|$|R

40|$|The {{adoption}} of {{accrual basis of accounting}} by governments {{is an important}} element to transform the bureaucratic administrative cash-based system to a more informative financial management system to ensure the supply of comprehensive, reliable, and meaningful financial information for appropriate accountability and decision making. Yemen is engaged in such reform, with advent of the E-Government, Information and Telecommunication Technologies era. This study describes the Yemen Central Government’s accounting and reporting system, its institutional framework, its policy characteristics and the environmental conditions that are in favour and unfavourable of such reform change. It also investigates the relationships between attitudes, innovative and organisational factors, as well as the {{adoption of}} accrual basis of accounting barriers and its implementation. Additionally, it investigates the moderating effects of E-Government between the abovementioned relationships during the face of change. This is to test if E-Government interaction will influence the strength and direction of the mentioned relationships in the model, and if the predictive power of that model would be increased. Finally, it examines the feasibility of accrual basis of accounting in Yemen. This study applied multiple theories, multi-method approaches (mixed-methods), and utilised qualitative and quantitative methodologies for data (analysis), collected from questionnaires and interview surveys. Twenty hypotheses are tested. The findings show that innovative and organisational factors have a positive relationship with an attitude toward change, while barriers have a negative relationship with an attitude toward change, but E-Government has a positive relationship with an attitude toward change. The results show that institutional frameworks such as the current Yemen governmental accounting and reporting framework, have an acceptable level of moving towards accrual basis of accounting, while accounting system objectives and reporting policy specifications reveal acceptable level of objectives and insufficient level of reporting policy. Even though the Yemen government officially announced the adoption of accrual basis of accounting and performed several alterations on the accounting system toward accrual basis, central government accounting officials are still using (modified) <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accounting.</b> Computer integration, across governmental departments, is not complete. Environmental factors that contributed to change from cash basis to accrual basis of accounting are reform stimuli, pressures related to other reforms, and forces of globalisation. The contextual variables are in favour of moving toward accrual basis of accounting. Attitudes toward change were found to have a full mediation effect between innovation factors, organisational factors, barriers, and E-Government, emphasising the important role of accountants, financial managers, and others in the feasible adoption and implementation of accrual basis of accounting. E-Government shows a moderating effect on the relationships between all independent variables and the mediating variable of attitude toward change. This study found Government officials' attitude toward change from <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accounting</b> to accrual basis of accounting to be very critical for the adoption and implementation of such change. Government financial officials have to be in line with the change process and their support is crucial for a successful adoption.

However, the suitability of accrual-based accounting in the public sector are debatable based on the experience of pioneer countries of accruals. This study explores the perceptions of Malaysian public managers on the applicability of accrual accounting concept in the public sector and the usefulness of accrual-based governmental financial reports towards the public managers in discharging their duties. Besides, this study also highlights the neutral response upon the study. This study finds that there are significant differences between the responses from three different level of government sector on the reporting entity of a consolidated report, the definition and concept of controlled assets by public entities and the use of accumulated surplus and equity as a financial performance indicator. In addition, the study indicates that familiarity and experience over time will contribute to higher perceptions towards the usefulness of accrual-based information. Furthermore, the neutral response from the respondents suggests that an in-depth discussion between the public sector managers and experts from the accounting field to improve the understanding among the Malaysian public sector managers. Hence, this study provides useful insights to the standard setters in the process of MPSAS formulation with regards to the general purpose financial reporting model for the public sector in Malaysia.

The out come of the research shows that the accounting method used in recording financial transactions for Pasar Turi as a Perusahaan Daerah Imajinasi can give more detail information in the financial report than the information provided by the financial report of pasar Turi as a UP- 4. The reference used to rearrange the financial statement of Perusahaan daerah Pasar Turi Imajinasi is the financial statement of Perusahaan Daerah Pasar Surabaya.

Such effects are "pro-cyclical": they worsen deflation that, after 2008 depression, is nowadays markedly ongoing. The statistical analysis already carried out shows a clear differentiation of effects on territories. In the Centre-North of Italy, a trend to the reduction of municipalities' expenditure and to the alleviation of tax burden prevail structurally. In the South of Italy, on the contrary, it appears to prevail an opposite trend. This causes a considerable reduction of the gap between available resources (such a gap, in 1999, was equal to 30 % and, in the long run, it has been gradually reducing up to 10 %); this reduction, {{both in terms of}} accrual basis accounting and of <b>cash</b> <b>basis</b> <b>accounting,</b> is the effect of a worsening of life conditions of employees, due to considerably higher taxes; such an increase of tax burden has caused a trend increase of revenue, which since 1999 has been equal to 25. 4 %, in terms of accrual basis accounting, in the South of Italy, compared to 16. 9 % in the Centre-North of Italy. Secondly, the serious risks that such a current situation entails for the financial sustainability of the Municipalities are shown.
