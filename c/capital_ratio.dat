40|$|Empirical studies provide {{evidence}} that bank <b>capital</b> <b>ratios</b> exceed regulatory requirements. But why do banks maintain capital levels above regulatory requirements? We use data for more than 2, 600 banks from 10 European countries to test recent theories suggesting that competition incentivises banks to maintain higher <b>capital</b> <b>ratios.</b> These theories also predict that banks that engage in arm's length lending have lower <b>capital</b> <b>ratios,</b> and that shareholder rights and deposit insurance characteristics affect <b>capital</b> <b>ratios.</b> Consistent with these theories, our evidence robustly indicates that competition increases capital holdings. Banks that lend at arm's length exhibit lower <b>capital</b> <b>ratios,</b> whereas banks in countries with strong shareholder rights operate with higher <b>capital</b> <b>ratios.</b> We also show some evidence that generous deposit protection schemes that exclude non-deposit creditors are associated with higher <b>capital</b> <b>ratios.</b> Our results have important policy implications.

40|$|Does the {{combination}} of inflation and high corporate taxes explain the increase in bank leverage in the 20 th century? Inflation automatically increases bank debt, while high corporate taxes hinder <b>capital</b> accumulation. <b>Capital</b> <b>ratios</b> therefore drop, until leverage-induced returns are sufficient to uphold them at constant levels. This theory was confronted with Swedish bank data 1870 – 2001. Bank <b>capital</b> <b>ratios</b> dropped when inflation and corporate tax rates were high, during WWI and in 1940 – 1980. The theory can explain the sinking bank <b>capital</b> <b>ratios</b> during these periods, but also their relative stability since the early 1980 s.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{evaluate}} the impact of Basel III on Czech banks and to compare the effectiveness of <b>capital</b> <b>ratios</b> in predicting bank distress. After a short introduction, in the second chapter we estimate the impact of tightened Basel III capital regulation on lending spreads in the Czech banking sector. In this chapter we conclude that the tightened capital regulation will not lead to more expensive borrowing in the Czech Republic mainly because the banking sector has been well-capitalized. In the third chapter we identify the strategies that Czech banks adopted in order to significantly increase their <b>capital</b> <b>ratios</b> between 2009 and 2013. Our analysis shows that retained earnings have {{played a major role}} in increasing the average capital adequacy of Czech banks.

40|$|In recent decades, {{despite the}} Basel Committee’s {{effort to develop}} internationally uniform {{regulatory}} capital standards, the <b>capital</b> <b>ratios</b> of banks across countries continue to exhibit significant differences.

The results of the theoretical model suggest that even with an internationally uniform risk-based capital requirement, {{it is unreasonable to}} expect banks in different countries to hold similar <b>capital</b> <b>ratios.</b> This occurs, in part, because regulators have discretion in how they apply the risk-based capital standards. Furthermore, the results suggest that a necessary condition for banks to exhibit similar <b>capital</b> <b>ratios</b> is that uniform capital requirements must be accompanied by a uniform stringency and application of regulatory supervision...|$|R

30|$|Going over Table  7 {{leads to}} three conclusions: First, the optimal <b>capital</b> <b>ratios</b> for Swiss G-SIBs are about 2.5 {{percentage}} {{points higher than}} the required Swiss TBTF <b>capital</b> <b>ratios</b> of 14.3 % (Basel III Tier 1) and 10 % (CET 1). Second, a similar picture emerges for the large banks of other countries. The optimal <b>capital</b> <b>ratios</b> are always above the minimum equity requirements of the BCBS. Third, results vary across studies. With the exception of Brooke et al. (2015), all studies estimate optimal <b>capital</b> <b>ratios</b> above 15 %. This difference mainly results from a different understanding of loss-absorbing bank capital. As in all the other studies, Brooke et al. (2015) estimate the optimal <b>capital</b> <b>ratios</b> {{on the basis of}} going concern equity capital because bank equity is the only reliable loss absorber in financial crises. Other forms of capital, in particular hybrid capital, failed in the financial crisis of 2007 / 2008. Nevertheless, Brooke et al. (2015) make a general downward adjustment of their optimal <b>capital</b> <b>ratios</b> to reflect the regulatory requirement that banks have to meet gone concern capital in addition to the going concern bank equity. 31 Gone concern capital is equity-like capital such as subordinated debt subject to bail-in. Its intention is to provide capital for failed banks in order to recapitalize, restructure, or wind them down without using taxpayer funds. Moreover, from a conceptional point of view, it is not appropriate to mix going and gone concern capital considerations as it would imply not only a different cost curve but also a benefit curve that includes two objectives: (i) the reduction of crisis probability due to higher equity capital and (ii) the benefits of an orderly resolution due to gone concern capital.|$|R
