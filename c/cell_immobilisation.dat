40|$|Although the {{xanthan gum}} has been {{produced}} {{as a commercial}} commodity, the biomass isolation and its recovery are still challenging. This study revealed the xanthan gum production by fermentation of Xanthomonas campestris DSMZ using glucose as a carbon source in an immobilised batch and a continuous recycled packed fibrous-bed bioreactor-membrane (CRPBFBM). The pure cotton fibre was used to immobilise the microbial cell biomass and to isolate from the liquid phase containing medium and xanthan gum. The cellulose acetate membrane with 0. 45 µm was used to recover the xanthan gum. The batch fermentation showed that the immobilisation technique gave higher xanthan gum concentration at 20 g/L than the free moving <b>cell</b> without <b>immobilisation</b> at 18 g/L. The CRPBBM produced the highest xanthan gum concentration at 18. 7 g/L at the dilution rate of 1. 44 d- 1. The highest production rate of CRPBFBM was 0. 475 g/L-h. Further {{research needs to be}} conducted to ascertain the stability of the Xanthomonas Campestris DSMZ during a long period of continuous fermentation as well as up scaling the CRPBFBM...|$|R

The focus of this study was to investigate the <b>immobilisation</b> of yeast <b>cells</b> onto carbon nanotubes, using a flocculation method, for possible use in fermentation processes. Carbon nanotubes, which are long thin cylinders of carbon, were used as artificial agents to induce flocculation of yeast <b>cells.</b> The <b>immobilisation</b> experiments on carbon nanotubes were conducted under different process conditions and compared with control experiments done on free cells. The resultant immobilised cells or flocs were recovered and freeze dried before analysis was performed. The flocculated cells were characterised by scanning electron microscopy to confirm that flocculation had occurred. Conditions that gave optimum flocculation on carbon nanotubes were found to be: a pH between 5. 0 and 5. 8, a temperature between 25 °C and 30 °C, an agitation speed of about 110 rpm, and a concentration of carbon nanotubes (in powder form) of between 44 mg/mL and 54 mg/mL. The addition of calcium ions and glucose decreased the rate of flocculation and delayed the onset of flocculation.

40|$|<b>Cell</b> <b>immobilisation</b> in {{alcoholic}} fermentation {{has been extensively}} studied {{during the past few}} decades because of its technical and economical advantages over those of free cell systems. A biocatalyst was prepared by immobilising a commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain (baker yeast) on corn stem ground tissue for use in {{alcoholic fermentation}}. For this purpose, the yeast cells were submitted to the batch tests 'in situ' adsorption onto pieces of the corn stem ground tissue. Cells immobilisation was analysed by optical microscopy. It was determined that the addition of the corn stem ground tissue led to an increase of the pH value, total dissolved salts content, and sugar content in fermentation medium. The addition of 5 and 10 g of the corn stem ground tissue per liter of medium, increased ethanol yield, decreased amount of residual sugar and the cells immobilisation was effective. Corn stem is one of the abundant, available, inexpensive, stable, reusable, nontoxic celulosic biomaterial with high porosity, which facilitates the transmission of substrates and products between carrier and medium. The prepared immobilised biocatalyst showed higher fermentation activity than free cells. The results indicate that corn stem might be an interesting support for yeast <b>cell</b> <b>immobilisation,</b> and also a cheap alternative recourse of mineral components with possibility of application for improving ethanol productivities...|$|E

40|$|Sodium {{alginate}} has applications as {{a material}} for the encapsulation and immobilisation {{of a variety of}} cell types for immunoisolatory and biochemical processing applications. It forms a biodegradable gel when crosslinked with calcium ions and it has been exploited in cartilage tissue engineering since chondrocytes do not dedifferentiate when immobilised in it. Despite its attractive properties of degradability, ease of processing and <b>cell</b> <b>immobilisation,</b> there is little work demonstrating the efficacy of alginate gel as a substrate for cell proliferation, except when RGD is modified. In this study we investigated the ability of rat bone marrow cells to proliferate and differentiate on alginates of differing composition and purity. The mechanical properties of the gels were investigated. It was found that high purity and high G-type alginate retained 27 % of its initial strength after 12 days in culture and that comparable levels of proliferation were observed on this material and tissue culture plastic. Depending on composition, calcium crosslinked alginate can act as a substrate for rat marrow cell proliferation and has potential for use as 3 D degradable scaffold...|$|E

MethodsWe used a covalent method of gentamicin sulphate immobilisation to polyethylene terephthalate prosthesis sealed with gelatin. Antibacterial activity was assayed in Luria-Bertani medium against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. Prosthesis endothelialisation was performed using bovine aorta endothelial cells (BAEC). ResultsGentamicin {{was bound to}} vascular prostheses {{in the amount of}} 12 g per kg of prosthesis. Ninety-seven percent of antibiotic bound in covalent way and remained on the biomaterial for at least 30 days during shaking in PBS solution. Gentamicin-modified prostheses exerted bactericidal or bacteriostatic effect on growth of clinical and reference bacterial strains, prevented biofilm formation and were highly susceptible to endothelialisation. BAEC viability exceeded 90 %, which indicated that gentamicin-vascular prostheses were not toxic for these <b>cells.</b> ConclusionsCovalent gentamicin <b>immobilisation</b> resulted in effective antibacterial protection of vascular prostheses against clinical and reference strains of S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa and allowed for a strong adherence of endothelial cells to antibiotic-modified prostheses...|$|R
40|$|Important {{aspects of}} ethanol {{production}} from undetoxified dilute acid lignocellulose hydrolysate {{are covered in}} this thesis, which primarily focuses {{on the use of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) as the biocatalyst. Nine different strains of S. cerevisiae were compared for fermentation of dilute acid lignocellulose hydrolysate with batch and fed-batch methodology and the one found to be best, ATCC 96581, was used in further studies involving S. cerevisiae. Cultures of this strain could stay viable during extended continuous cultivations with low cell growth, achieved with cell recirculation, and consumed more than 99 % of the available glucose. However, the ethanol yield was not significantly affected neither by excessive nitrogen limitation nor microaerobic conditions. Importantly, microaerobicity stabilised cell survival during these cumbersome conditions. Cell retention was also applied to ferment dilute acid lignocellulose hydrolysate in a continuous reactor, which increased the cell concentration and improved both the utilisation of hexoses and the intracellular conversion of at least one inhibitory compound in the hydrolysate (5 -hydroxymethyl furfural). Cell retention by filtration, as a method to improve fermentation of lignocellulose hydrolysate supplemented with wheat hydrolysate, ammonium sulphate and biotin, was furthermore compared to alternative methods of <b>cell</b> retention: <b>immobilisation</b> and sedimentation. All cell retention methods were useful for improving hexose utilisation at a dilution rate of 0. 10 h - 1, but washout occurred in all systems except for the immobilised system when the dilution rate was increased to 0. 20 h - 1. In a study on M. indicus, an 'alternative' fermenting organism, which can ferment also pentoses, it was shown that this organism is suitable for fed-batch fermentation of dilute acid lignocellulose hydrolysate. With an initial dilution rate of 0. 20 h - 1, the sugar consumption and the ethanol yield were satisfactory. Moreover, the troublesome filamentous growth of M. indicus was circumvented...|$|R

Plasmid stability of both free and immobilised cells was studied The percentage of plasmid-containing cells in suspension culture decreased to 24 % in 96 hours. The plasmid stability of <b>cells</b> throughout the <b>immobilisation</b> matrix was measured. It was found that cells in the centre of the gel beads retained the recombinant plasmid to a greater degree than free cells, or cells at the surface of the matrix. Continuous stable production of p~glucanase by free cells in non-selective medium was not possible. Enzyme production by the immobilised yeast strain, however, was stable for 10 days, with no sign of decrease. The enzyme productivity for immobilised cells in a continuous reactor (using non-selective medium), was 48 U/ml/h, compared to 3 6 U/ml/h for free cells in batch culture using nonselective medium...|$|R

It was shown that under typical immobilisation conditions yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has no affinity to HAP ceramics. A novel method for yeast immobilisation was developed. This new method includes the joint incubation of a carrier with the cells, the sedimentation and adhesion of cells on the carrier and the dehydration of obtained preparations. It was shown that the sedimentation and adhesion stages strongly depend on the value of the electron work function of the HAP ceramics surface. An increase in this value, which corresponds to a higher negative charge on the ceramics surface, correlates with higher <b>cell</b> <b>immobilisation.</b> The dehydration stage strongly and stably fixes cells on the ceramics.

In {{order to provide}} greater control of an overall colour removal process and to give {{a basis for the}} effective recovery of the cell culture species, <b>cell</b> <b>immobilisation</b> has been established on chemically modified cellulose. The modification was achieved by chemically inducing the graft copolymerisation of methacrylic acid onto cotton fabric. The immobilised cells were able to decolorise the dye. The immobilisation methods, physical adsorption, “growing-in” and chemical coupling, were compared. Each of the methods was effective to some extent. However, the latter two immobilisation methods provided the greater effect in decoloration. Each of these immobilised systems is relatively simple to achieve, whether by adsorption, physical interlocking or covalent coupling. The graft copolymer is able to offer versatility in use. The decoloration was shown to be rapid under relatively simple processing conditions. Thus, compared with the established controls, complete decoloration of solutions of Remazol Black B was observed.

40|$|An {{effect of}} permeabilisation and {{lyophilisation}} of the yeast cells Hansenula polymorpha on their electrochemical behaviour {{in the presence}} of mediators, substrates (formaldehyde, glucose, methanol, ethanol), and cofactors (NAD(+), NADP(+), NADH, NADPH, glutathione) has been studied. Two amperometric techniques differing in the <b>cell</b> <b>immobilisation</b> methods were applied. The cells of a wild strain (356) and mutant strains (C- 105 and KCA 33) of the yeast, grown {{in the presence of}} glucose or methanol, were used in the experiments. The intact cells revealed the highest reduction rates of mediators, 2, 6 -dichlorphenolindophenol (DCIP) and 2, 4 -benzoquinone (BQ) as measured by amperometry. The addition of formaldehyde significantly enhanced the response, if the cells were grown in the presence of glucose. The permeabilised cells showed the lowest current level in the presence of DCIP and BQ and no response to the addition of formaldehyde and NAD(+). However, the addition of NADH gave significant current surge. All these phenomena imply that the permeabilised cells lost cofactors and the activity of dehydrogenases producing NADH, but they remained the activity of NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase and of some components of the electron transport chain. The electrochemical behaviour of the lyophilised cells shows they are heterogeneous. The partial degradation of the outer membrane of the cells after their lyophilisation was electrochemically confirmed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Surface exposed cysteines were genetically {{engineered}} {{in the structure}} of recombinant horseradish peroxidase (rHRP). Recombinant forms of HRP with either a His-tag or a Strep-tag at the C-terminus were produced, which additionally had cysteines at positions 57, 189 or 309 (C-terminus) of the polypeptide chain. An E coli expression system was exploited. The effect of these mutations on the direct electron transfer (ET) between An and the enzyme was studied in the reaction of the bioelectrocatalytic reduction of H 2 O 2, at - 50 mV versus AgAgCl, on rHRP-modified Au electrodes placed in a wall-jet flow-through electrochemical <b>cell.</b> Adsorptive <b>immobilisation</b> of rHRPs on pre-oxidised Au from the protein solution at pH 6. 0 provided a high and stable current response to H 2 O 2 due to its bioelectrocatalytic reduction based on direct (mediatoriess) ET between Au and the active site of the rHRPs. Comparative analysis of the direct ET rate constants, estimated from the amperometric data on direct and mediated ET in the presence of catechol at pH 7. 4 and 6. 0, gave evidence that the introduction of the His-tag or cysteine in the C-terminal area of the enzyme resulted in an increased efficiency of direct ET due to a favourable coupled electron and proton transfer pathway. Due to the high efficiency of direct ET, the sensitivity was independent on the addition of the mediator or change of pH indicating that the response to H 2 O 2 is determined solely by the mass transfer of the analyte to the active site of HRP. The sensitivities obtained for the Au electrodes modified with rHRPs (2. 0 +/- 0. 1 A M- 1 cm(- 2)) and the low detection limit for H 2 O 2 (10 nM) paves the way to develop the P-chip (peroxidase chip) - a biosensors system of a microscopic size for a mediatorless detection of H 2 O 2 based on direct ET between Au and the recombinant forms of HRP.

40|$|The {{ability of}} the NAR- 2 {{bacterial}} consortium, consisting of A 1, C 1, and L 17, to degrade the azo dye model, Remazol Black B (RBB), was studied in an upflow packed-bed reactor for continuous sequential micro- aerophilic–aerobic batch operations. Continuous decolourisation was performed in a borosilicate glass col- umn (12 mm 9 20 mm) packed with surfactant-modified clinoptilolite immobilised by the NAR- 2 bacterial consor- tium. In column bioreactor studies, decolourisation was observed at 45 ° C and {{was carried out by}} varying the flow rates and dye concentrations in a modified P 5 medium with pH 7. 0 under microaerophilic conditions. A decolourisation of 95. 87 % of 0. 1 g/L RBB was achieved at a flow rate of 0. 2 mL/min under microaerophilic conditions by the immobilised NAR- 2 bacterial consortium. An analysis of the decolourised and biodegradation products of the RBB using total aromatic amines showed that a reduction in the RBB resulted in the formation of aromatic amines. On further aerobic degradation for 15 days, the concentration of the amines dropped significantly, from an initial con- centration of 34 to 11 mg/L, following the aerobic batch treatment experiment. The findings of this study showed that SMC can be a support material for bacterial <b>cell</b> <b>immobilisation</b> in a single upflow reactor with intermittent microaerophilic–aerobic operations, and it was found to be suitable and eco-friendly for the degradation of azo dyes...|$|E
40|$|Fermentation and {{maturation}} are {{the most}} time consuming steps {{in the production of}} beer, the duration of which is typically between 5 – 7 and 7 – 30 days, respectively. The continuous fermentation process based on immobilised yeast cell technology allows producing an acceptable end product within as little as 2 – 3 days. In spite of the economic advantages that continuous beer fermentation offers, difficulties of technical and economic origin have retarded the implementation of the process at industrial scale so far. For example, the total investment costs depend significantly on carrier costs and applied technology. Thus the use of cheap carrier materials in a suitably designed bioreactor could favour the economics of the immobilised process, inspire researchers and encourage brewing engineers. Among the available yeast <b>cell</b> <b>immobilisation</b> techniques, flocculation of micro-organisms, due to its simplicity and low cost, is very attractive because there are no complex mechanical devices needed as well as any supporting material in this technique. This can be an advantage over other immobilisation techniques since {{it is well known that}} a support represents a major cost in immobilisation procedures. Flocculation of yeast cells usually observed at the end of fermentation and is of great importance in beer brewing. It can occur naturally or it can be artificially induced by different agents. The focus of the study was to investigate the immobilisation of yeast cells onto Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) using flocculation method. CNTs; long, thin cylinders of carbon; can be used as artificial agents to induce flocculation of yeast cells because they are increasingly being recognised as promising materials for catalysis, either as catalysts themselves, as catalyst additives or as a catalyst support. CNTs are inert and positively charged which enable them to attract negatively charged yeast cells to form flocs. The use of CNTs to improve yeast flocculation for fermentation processes has not been reported yet in literature. CNTs were synthesised by Swirled Floating Catalyst Chemical Vapour Deposition (SFCCVD) method. The optimum conditions required to synthesise the best samples of CNTs were temperature of 800 oC, acetylene flowrate of 844 ml/min for a reaction time of 20 minutes. The synthesised CNTs were characterised by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Raman Spectroscopy to obtain the type of nanotubes, morphology and their purity. The yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain NRRL Y 2084, a dry brewer’s yeast obtained from National Food Products, Emmarentia, Johannesburg) were immobilised onto CNTs by flocculation method to produce a immobilised cells. The flocculation process was measured by two methods: a qualitative process of using the naked eye to rank the flocs as either -, +, ++ or +++ and a quantitative method of measuring the floc weight recovered using a centrifuge and dried in an oven at 40 oC for 24 hours. The flocculation of the immobilised cells was compared with a control experiment which had free cells. The immobilised cells and free cells were both recovered and dried using a freeze dryer for analysis and use in fermentation. Conditions required for the flocculation process were an agitation speed of 110 rpm, pH 5. 60, a temperature of 30 oC and concentration of 53. 57 μg/ml of CNTs. Addition of calcium ions at 5. 49 mM resulted in good flocculation but the presence of glucose delayed onset of flocculation by 4 – 5 days. The flocculated cells were characterised by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Optical Microscopy. The flocculation conditions used in the study were comparable with those in literature. The immobilised cells and the free cells were introduced into malt extract for fermentation at 15 and 30 oC. The fermentation rates observed were compared with those found in literature by comparing the final ethanol concentration observed. Free cells produced more ethanol, 2. 49...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} immobilise biomolecules on solid {{surfaces}} whilst retaining their function {{is the foundation}} of microarrays, biosensors and other miniaturised assays that provide convenient ways of analysing binding reactions of molecules with their ligands. The stability, sensitivity, cost and ease of use are important considerations when designing these systems, with the immobilisation of the biomolecule to a surface being the key to success. Miniaturised assays can allow multiplex analysis of various samples from protein interactions, carbohydrate recognition events, DNA hybridisation and <b>cell</b> <b>immobilisation.</b> They can enable fast, high-throughput and efficient testing for diagnostics, environmental testing and research purposes, as well as enabling production of whole-cell arrays to tissue engineering. The drive to miniaturisation and integration has advanced the need for effective and stable attachment of biomolecules to solid surfaces which allow high probe density and high signal to noise ratio whilst maintaining the activity of the molecule. KODE™ technology is a surface engineering technology that enables modification of a cell or virion surface without causing harm. This is achieved with Function-Spacer-Lipid (FSL) constructs that embed into the membrane. They contain a functional head group that conveys a desirable attribute to the cell or virion, which include carbohydrate or peptide antigens, fluorescent markers, whole proteins or useful molecules for attachment, e. g. biotin. This research set out to determine if FSL constructs could modify non-biological surfaces as well as biological ones. The aims of this research were to establish whether FSL constructs could be attached to non-biological surfaces, and if so what the mechanisms of attachment and the limitations might be and what methods could be used to deliver the molecules to the surface. Inkjet printing was investigated as the primary delivery method, as it is becoming a popular approach to apply biological molecules to surfaces. It is a non-contact, precise, flexible and fast technique which lends itself well to this field where precise patterning, sample and waste volume and cost are important factors. The water soluble advantages of FSL constructs make their use as a “bioink” attractive and this method proved to be successful at applying FSLs to surfaces. FSL constructs were successfully applied to various surfaces including papers, polymers, metals, modified cellulose materials and natural fibres. All surfaces were able to attach the FSLs. The stability of the attachment was shown to be unchanged after 8 months at room temperature. Some detergents and solvents were able to remove the FSLs from the surface, indicating particular limitations of the attachment. Variations of the FSL structure gave insights into the attachment mechanisms which indicated that the amphiphilic nature of these constructs is important, with hydrophobic forces causing adsorption of these constructs onto solid surfaces. Investigations into possible applications of FSL modified surfaces included mapping monoclonal antibodies against different blood group antigens, assessing disease markers in solid phase and attaching recombinant proteins to surfaces. The surface selected as optimal for bioassays was paper due to low background staining and high sensitivity when used in immunoassays. FSL constructs appear to allow orientated immobilisation of biomolecules, spaced away from the surface. Good correlation to serological results using the same constructs was observed, indicating the solid phase FSL assays can provide accurate results. Cells and kodecytes were also shown to be immobilised onto solid surfaces through FSL attachment. Through linker molecules, red blood cells were attached to microspheres, paper, plastic and other surfaces which themselves were modified with FSLs. This is a potential novel method for producing cellular arrays, cellular bandages and for other applications needing precise attachment of cells. Further research will reveal other types of cells able to be used in this way. In summary it was discovered that FSL constructs were able to modify non-biological surfaces with carbohydrate antigens, peptide markers and biotin, adding functionality {{to a wide variety of}} surfaces. This now opens up the potential to use FSLs as a universal surface modification technology by providing a fast, simple and easily controlled approach for biomolecule immobilisation...|$|E
