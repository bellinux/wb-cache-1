25|$|Neuroethics {{encompasses}} the myriad {{ways in which}} developments in basic and clinical neuroscience intersect with social and ethical issues. The field is so young that any attempt to define its scope and limits now will undoubtedly be proved wrong in the future, as neuroscience develops and its implications continue to be revealed. At present, however, we can discern two general categories of neuroethical issue: those emerging from what we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> those emerging from what we know.|$|E
25|$|The {{mathematical}} biologist Stuart Kauffman {{and other}} structuralists {{have suggested that}} self-organization may play roles alongside natural selection in three areas of evolutionary biology, namely population dynamics, molecular evolution, and morphogenesis. However, this {{does not take into}} account the essential role of energy in driving biochemical reactions in cells. The systems of reactions in any cell are self-catalyzing but not simply self-organizing as they are thermodynamically open systems relying on a continuous input of energy. Self-organization is not an alternative to natural selection, but it constrains what evolution <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> provides mechanisms such as the self-assembly of membranes which evolution then exploits.|$|E

25|$|An {{individual}} {{must be able}} {{to connect}} in order to achieve enhancement of social and cultural capital and achieve mass economic gains in productivity. Even though individuals in the United States are legally capable of accessing the Internet, many are thwarted by barriers to entry such as a lack of means to infrastructure or the inability to comprehend the information that the Internet provides. Lack of infrastructure and lack of knowledge are two major obstacles that impede mass connectivity. These barriers limit individuals' capabilities in what they <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> what they can achieve in accessing technology. Some individuals have the ability to connect, but have nonfunctioning capabilities in {{that they do not have}} the knowledge to use what information ICTs and Internet technologies provide them.|$|E
500|$|Blood {{was written}} and {{recorded}} {{in the same way}} as the first two OSI albums. Matheos and Moore worked together on the album long-distance, mainly by emailing each other files. Matheos would send Moore song ideas, [...] "from just a guitar riff to elaborate, almost completed songs," [...] Moore said. [...] "Then I ask what I <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> I mess around, complete a verse and add a chorus, do editing, add some vocals, and send it back to him." ...|$|E
500|$|Much of what {{characters}} <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> {{how well}} they do it, {{is determined by the}} game's eighty-three distinct character skills. A skill is a numerical representation of a character's proficiency in an area of skill, starting at zero. As players kill computer-controlled enemies, they gain experience points for their character. After gaining enough points, the character levels up. The current maximum level is 220. At each new level, the character is given some [...] "skill points", which are used to increase any combination of the eighty-three skills that they choose.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in December 1970, but did not sell as much as The Least We <b>Can</b> <b>Do,</b> <b>and</b> did not reach the album charts in the UK. Charisma hoped the group could produce another single like [...] "Refugees", released earlier in the year. There was some interest in releasing [...] "Killer" [...] as a single, but the band rejected this as {{they might have been}} pigeonholed as a hard rock band. The group felt there was some conflict of interest by having Tony Stratton-Smith both as manager and record company owner.|$|E
500|$|Hammill wanted King Crimson's guitarist and bandleader Robert Fripp {{to play on}} [...] "The Emperor In His War Room". Fripp {{had never}} played as a session {{musician}} at that point, but had enjoyed listening to The Least We <b>Can</b> <b>Do...</b> <b>and</b> was persuaded to take part by Anthony. Jackson recalled that Fripp [...] "set up all of his stuff, put his headphones on, and started searing away." [...] Fripp played the guitar part twice, having never heard the track before, and a composite of both takes appears on the final recording. Fripp has subsequently introduced Anthony as [...] "the guy who gave me my first session" [...] at events. Fripp would collaborate again with Van der Graaf Generator on their next album, Pawn Hearts, released the following year.|$|E

Her Campuss Kelly Tierney noted the enthusiasm displayed by Oliver's fans during the segment and wrote: While John Oliver simply considers himself a comedian, it is apparent that he is doing much more than comedy. [...] He informs us of real issues we otherwise wouldn't hear or think deeply about, which in and of itself is brilliant, but what really sets him apart is his way of calling his audience to action about these issues. He shows us that there really is something we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> helps us to see how we can enact change.|$|E

500|$|Executive {{producer}} Al Jean {{notes that}} in The Simpsons writing room, [...] "everyone loves writing for Homer", {{and many of his}} adventures are based on experiences of the writers. In the early seasons of the show, Bart was the main focus. But, around the fourth season, Homer became more of the focus. According to Matt Groening, this was because [...] "With Homer, there's just a wider range of jokes you <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> <b>And</b> there are far more drastic consequences to Homer's stupidity. There's only so far you can go with a juvenile delinquent. We wanted Bart to do anything up to the point of him being tried in court as an adult. But Homer is an adult, and his boneheaded-ness is funnier. [...] Homer is launching himself headfirst into every single impulsive thought that occurs to him." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Cissé's two goals, {{there had}} been {{speculation}} linking Liverpool with re-signing Michael Owen, who had left the club for Real Madrid a year earlier. Liverpool fans had even chanted Owen's name during the match, singing, [...] "There's only one Michael Owen." [...] Cissé underlined the importance of scoring twice with speculation rife: [...] "It is clear scoring two goals in the Super Cup is important for me, {{because there has been}} a lot of speculation about me of late and about my position within the club." [...] Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher stated the importance of the two goals for Cissé: [...] "Cissé wanted to prove a point – he wanted to show everyone what he <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> great credit to him. We're the players – it's up to us to play and the management decides which players we have." [...] Carragher confirmed that Liverpool missed their captain Gerrard, but was delighted to win the match despite this.|$|E
500|$|Donen made {{a host of}} {{critically}} acclaimed and popular films. His most important contribution {{to the art of}} film was helping to transition movie musicals from the realistic backstage settings of filmed theater to a more cinematic form that integrates film with dance. Eventually film scholars named this concept [...] "cine-dance" [...] (a dance that can only be created in the medium of film), and its origins are in the Donen/Kelly films. [...] Film scholar Casey Charness described [...] "cine-dance" [...] as [...] "a melding of the distinctive strengths of dancing and filmmaking that had never been done before" [...] and adds that Donen and Kelly [...] "seem to have elevated Hollywood dance from simplistic display of either dancing or photographic ability into a perception that incorporates both what the dancer <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> what the camera can see... developed a balance between camera and dancer that... encouraged both photographer and choreographer to contribute significantly to the creation and final effectiveness of dance." ...|$|E

500|$|When Steven S. DeKnight {{was writing}} the episode [...] "Run" [...] {{for the first}} {{official}} appearance of Bart Allen, {{he knew he had}} to give the character certain characteristics that embodied his comic book counterpart. DeKnight knew Bart had faster than Clark, because in the comic, that is one advantage Flash has over Superman. DeKnight also featured Bart as a [...] "smart-ass", after being inspired by the sarcastic Flash that appears in the animated television series, Justice League. DeKnight's belief is that Bart enjoys his powers, and would not exhibit the more [...] "somber or serious" [...] characteristics of other character. As Gallner pointed out, Bart accepts who he is, and what he <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> he even abuses his gifts somewhat. The difference between him and Clark is that Bart is not afraid to show the world what he can do. Gallner also suggested that in his character's initial appearance, Bart is living in a [...] "confused" [...] state, because he has developed these extraordinary powers, his parents do not accept him, and he ends up turning to thievery just to take care of himself.|$|E
500|$|... "Harvest Festival" [...] was {{the first}} episode of the season written and {{produced}} separately from the second season. The previous six episodes from the third season were filmed almost immediately after the second season ended {{as part of an}} early shooting schedule to accommodate Poehler's pregnancy. Series co-creator Michael Schur described it as a particularly empowering episode for the Leslie Knope character: [...] "When you see this episode [...] it makes you love her even more. This episode is about Leslie being noticed for the incredible hard work she does." [...] Schur also said he believed the subplot with April and Andy was one that several young people in their situation have faced in real life: [...] "Andy is put into a situation {{that a lot of people}} have been put into in our lives and he does the exact wrong thing you <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> <b>And</b> that's sort of the template for them going forward is what's the wrongest thing you can do? That's sort of how we follow them." [...] Chris Pratt said he believed the conflict provided strong romantic and comedic potential for the characters: [...] "There definitely will be conflict in their relationship [...] there's still a lot of room for comedy in there, because we have good writers." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the series}} finale, the Los Angeles Times {{characterized}} the series as [...] "an epic poem, with Jack Bauer {{in the role}} of Odysseus or Beowulf. Which means he needed to be fighting monsters, not essentially decent people who have made one very bad decision." [...] The critic {{went on to say that}} villain Charles Logan encapsulated all that [...] "Jack and 24 fought against for so long: political corruption and cowardice, narcissism and megalomania, ruthlessness and stupidity." [...] One reviewer for BuddyTV said that [...] "I'll remember the legacy of 24 as an action drama that redefined what serialized television <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> provided many shocking twists and turns along the way—the biggest one being the very real impact the show had on American foreign policy." [...] The New York Times said [...] "24 will live on, possibly as a feature film, and surely in classrooms and in textbooks. The series enlivened the country's political discourse in a way few others have, partly because it brought to life the ticking time-bomb threat that haunted the Cheney faction of the American government in the years after 9/11." [...] The show was declared the sixth highest rated show for the first ten years of IMDb.com Pro (2002–2012).|$|E

500|$|Ritchson {{described}} Arthur Curry {{as someone}} who will [...] "do anything to save what he loves". The actor {{goes on to say}} that Arthur is [...] "passionate about nature, about the earth, and about the seas", and is not afraid to use his abilities to save those things that are dear to him. When comparing his character to Clark, Ritchson stated that Arthur is more confident in his abilities, and already knows what he <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> what his path is in life. Another big difference the actor pointed out is that unlike Clark, Arthur is willing to sacrifice people and things if it means preserving the greater good. When he first appears, one of Victor Stone's key characteristics is that both he and Clark can relate to the fact that they feel their abilities inhibit them from having a true relationship with the women they love. The writers tried to create parallels between the characters to emphasize this more, like Victor's fear of telling his girlfriend the truth about what LuthorCorp did to his body, and Clark's fear of Lana Lang discovering he is an alien. Writer Tracy Bellomo characterized Oliver as a guy that does not take himself very seriously, and enjoys making fun of people that try to take him that way. Bellomo believed that this is one of the reasons that Oliver is attracted to Lois, with the other being that Lois provides a challenge for him. Oliver's relationship with Clark is designed to [...] "broaden Clark's rather limited horizons", and to teach Clark that a world exists beyond Smallville.|$|E
