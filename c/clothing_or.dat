5|$|All Operation Crossroads {{operations}} {{were designed to}} keep personnel from being exposed to more than 0.1 roentgen (R) per day. At the time, this {{was considered to be}} an amount of radiation that could be tolerated for long periods without any harmful effects on health. Since there was no special <b>clothing</b> <b>or</b> radiation shielding available, the protection plan relied on managing who went where, when, and for how long.|$|E
5|$|Benefitting {{from the}} advent of postcards, Mary Willumsen (1884–1961) photographed women in scanty <b>clothing</b> <b>or</b> nude at the Helgoland beach {{facility}} in Copenhagen. Between 1916 and 1920, she took many such photographs which she sold at a nearby kiosk. The operation was discontinued when the police began to take an interest. Many of the compositions are now considered to have considerable artistic merit.|$|E
5|$|Military {{camouflage}} patterns {{have been}} popular in fashion and art from {{as early as}} 1915.

In fashion, many major designers have exploited camouflage's style and symbolism, and military <b>clothing</b> <b>or</b> imitations of it have been used both as street wear and as a symbol of political protest.|$|E

In his biography, Chrisye noted that he enjoyed eating at roadside foodstalls well after his marriage and would be perplexed when people stared at him. Guruh recalled that Chrisye would sleep anywhere during extended planning sessions, including under the piano.|$|E
5|$|Halkett was {{an amateur}} inventor, and during {{his spare time}} whilst serving in the navy he worked on solving {{the problem of how}} to design a boat that would be small and light enough to {{transport}} easily on foot through wilderness, but robust enough to carry people in safety across wide bodies of water. His solution was to design a boat in which all components would double as items of <b>clothing,</b> <b>or</b> accessories that Halkett assumed the user would be carrying in any event.|$|E
5|$|The P90 can {{be fitted}} with a sling for greater ease of carry, and since the weapon has a fixed stock (as opposed to having a {{collapsing}} or folding stock), it can be quickly deployed when needed. The weapon's smooth, rounded contours prevent it from snagging on the shooter's <b>clothing</b> <b>or</b> equipment, and a small vertical protrusion is provided at {{the front end of}} the weapon's frame to prevent the shooter's hand from accidentally slipping in front of the muzzle while shooting. A hollow compartment inside the rear of the weapon's frame—accessed by removing the buttplate—allows for convenient storage of a cleaning kit.|$|E

5|$|The imprisoned {{soldiers}} {{received two}} {{meals a day}} of steamed rice, occasionally accompanied by fruit, soup, or meat. To supplement their diet, prisoners were able to smuggle food and supplies hidden in their underwear into the camp during Japanese-approved trips to Cabanatuan. To prevent extra food, jewelry, diaries, and other valuables from being confiscated, items were hidden in <b>clothing</b> <b>or</b> latrines, or were buried before scheduled inspections. Prisoners collected food {{using a variety of}} methods including stealing, bribing guards, planting gardens, and killing animals which entered the camp such as mice, snakes, ducks, and stray dogs. The Filipino underground collected thousands of quinine tablets to smuggle into the camp to treat malaria, saving hundreds of lives.|$|E
5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} who have little shall have less, and {{that those who have}} much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor; therefore they ought to be starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be beaten. They work hard; therefore they ought to be treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to be allowed to feel that they want food, or <b>clothing,</b> <b>or</b> rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E
5|$|As Styles was {{examining}} the ricochet marks, Alison Cahn {{was approached by}} an elderly woman, who led Cahn to a nearby apartment building. There, the woman introduced Cahn to her daughter—Carmen Proetta—who told Cahn that she had witnessed the shooting at the petrol station; although initially reluctant, she was persuaded by Cahn to give her account of the events in an affidavit. Proetta asserted that, immediately before McCann and Farrell were shot, she saw a police car travelling north on Winston Churchill Avenue with its siren activated; as she watched, the police car stopped abruptly and four men—one uniformed police officer and three men in civilian clothes—jumped out. She stated that the three men in plain clothes, all carrying pistols, leapt across the central reservation barrier, at which point she saw McCann and Farrell raise their hands. Proetta believed that all three men then opened fire, while McCann and Farrell had their hands in the air, and that neither suspect made any movements towards their <b>clothing</b> <b>or</b> Farrell's handbag. She went on to state that she witnessed {{one of the men}} crouch over McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, and continue to shoot them. According to Styles, Proetta's account of the shooting tallied with the bullet marks he examined at the petrol station; he also found her description of the bullets striking the bodies particularly convincing, believing that only somebody who had witnessed such an event would be able to describe it so vividly. The journalists also discovered that Proetta's account of the soldiers arriving in a police car matched some of the newspaper reports from the day after the shootings.|$|E
