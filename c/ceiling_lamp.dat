After the war he studied architecture in Brno and Vienna and worked as an architect in Brno until the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. He was deported to Theresienstadt in 1942, where he worked as an architect for the Jewish self-adminstration of the camp, and produced works of art as well. In 1944 he was imprisoned by the Gestapo, and was sent to Auschwitz later that year. After liberation, he lived briefly in Cracow, and then reopened his architectural business in Prague and Brno. He emigrated to the United States in 1948 and worked for the National Jewish Welfare Board in New York designing Jewish community centers, before opening his own practice. He died in 1981. updatedDigital imag...|$|E

The full text may be available through the publisher links provided above. In an office room, many factors affect the pattern of airflow, thermal comfort, indoor air quality and energy saving. In this study, the effects of the location of exhaust diffusers where the warm and contaminant air is extracted and their relation to room heat sources on thermal comfort and energy saving were investigated numerically for an office served by a displacement ventilation system. The indoor air quality in the breathing level and the inhaled zone were also evaluated. The contaminants were released from window and door frames in order to simulate the contaminants coming from outside. The amount of energy consumption and the indoor thermal environment for various exhaust locations were investigated numerically using the computational fluid dynamics techniques. The results showed that the thermal indoor environment, thermal comfort, quality of indoor air and energy saving were greatly improved by combining the exhaust outlets with some of the room’s heat sources such as <b>ceiling</b> <b>lamps</b> and external walls. In particular, a 25. 0 % of energy saving was achieved by combining the exhaust diffuser with room’s <b>ceiling</b> <b>lamps.</b> In addition, locating the exhaust diffuser near the heat sources also reduced the cooling coil load by 13. 8 %. The risk of a large difference in temperature between the head and foot levels, increased particle concentration in the occupied zone, as well as increased energy consumption was also clearly demonstrated when the exhaust and recirculated air outlet (return opening) were combined in one unit in the occupied boundary area that is located at 2 m away from the occupants. Thus, for the optimum energy saving and better indoor environment, the combination of the indoor heat sources with the exhaust outlet is necessary. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R

40|$|Efficient and {{realistic}} mm-wave channel models are of vital {{importance for the}} development of novel mm-wave wireless technologies. Though many of the current 60 GHz channel models are based on the useful concept of multi-path clusters, {{only a limited number of}} 60 GHz channel measurements have been reported in the literature for this purpose. Therefore, there is still a need for further measurement based analyses of multi-path clustering in the 60 GHz band. This paper presents clustering results for a double-directional 60 GHz MIMO channel model. Based on these results, we derive a model which is validated with measured data. Statistical cluster parameters are evaluated and compared with existing channel models. It is shown that the cluster angular characteristics are closely related to the room geometry and environment, making it infeasible to model the delay and angular domains independently. We also show that when using ray tracing to model the channel, it is insufficient to only consider walls, ceiling, floor and tables; finer structures such as <b>ceiling</b> <b>lamps,</b> chairs and bookshelves need to be taken into account as well...|$|R
40|$|Ultraviolet {{germicidal}} irradiation (UVGI) lamps {{are used}} in biological safety cabinets and laboratory containment rooms as methods of surface decontamination. Although some organizations have discouraged the use of UVGI for disinfection, many scientists continue to request this method. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the reliability of using UVGI produced from UV <b>ceiling</b> <b>lamps</b> as an effective method to decrease microbial agent contamination from floor surfaces in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. Actively growing Bacillus cereus and B. anthracis vegetative cells or spores (Sterne strain-Veterinary Vaccine Formula) were used as biological indicators to assess UVGI effects within the containment laboratory. Studies were conducted using UVGI exposure times ranging from 15 minutes to 2 hours with varying inoculums ranging from 10 3 to 10 9 colony-forming unit per sample. Later in the study an UVGI radiometer was used to determine the UVGI intensity and to measure the correlation between the biological indicator results and mechanical instrument data. Study results showed that ceilingmounted UVGI lamps were effective in reducing the viability of both B. cereus and B. anthracis vegetative cells and spores after a minimum UVGI exposure time of 1 hour at an intensity as low as 8 uW/cm 2. Additionally, an UVGI radiometer could be used to determine UVGI effectiveness and a UVGI intensity of 8 uW/cm 2 to 42 uW/cm 2 corresponded with the increased disinfection observed...|$|R

40|$|Both well-designed {{equipment}} and trained employees {{are required to}} maintain a high standard of animal welfare during slaughter. When McDonald's Corporation started auditing U. S. beef and pork slaughter plants in 1999, there were great improvements in handling and stunning. They used a numerical objective scoring system. It contained five basic measurements: (1) the percentage of animals stunned on the first attempt, (2) percentage rendered insensible prior to hoisting, (3) percentage vocalizing during handling and stunning. (4) percentage that fall down and (5) percentage moved with an electric goad. Each variable was scored on a simple yes/no basis. Baseline data was collected prior to the McDonald's audits in 1996. The most striking improvements were in beef. The average effective first shot stunning score was 89. 5 % in 1996, 96. 2 % in 1999 and 98. 6 % 5 years later in 2003. The average percentage of cattle vocalizing during stunning and handling was 8 % in 1996, 2. 4 % in 1999 and 2. 0 % in 2003. A total of 50 plants were audited. Most plants were able to greatly improve welfare by improving stunner maintenance; installing non-slip floor gratings in stun boxes and better training. They also had to make simple, low cost changes to eliminate distractions that cause animals to balk and refuse to move. The most common ways to improve animal movement were: (1) install a lamp on a dark race entrance, (2) move <b>ceiling</b> <b>lamps</b> to eliminate sparkling reflections, (3) muffle air hissing, (4) install shields and solid sides on races to prevent animals from seeing moving people up ahead and (5) eliminate air drafts that blow {{in the faces of}} approaching animals. A major remaining problem area is in plants that are not in a program of yearly audits by restaurants. Serious animal abuse has occurred in some of these non-audited plants. 1...|$|R
