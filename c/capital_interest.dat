25|$|George {{noted that}} most debt, though bearing the {{appearance}} of genuine <b>capital</b> <b>interest,</b> was not issued {{for the purpose of}} creating true capital, but instead as an obligation against rental flows from existing economic privilege. George therefore reasoned that the state should not provide aid to creditors in the form of sheriffs, constables, courts, and prisons to enforce collection on these illegitimate obligations. George did not provide any data to support this view, but in today's developed economies, much of the supply of credit is created to purchase claims on future land rents, rather than to finance the creation of true capital. Michael Hudson and Adair Turner estimate that about 80 percent of credit finances real estate purchases, mostly land.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the {{argument}} of the Government, {{in a variety of}} forms, runs the fundamental error already mentioneda failure to appraise correctly the force of the term [...] "income" [...] as used in the Sixteenth Amendment, or at least to give practical effect to it. Thus, the Government contends that the tax [...] "is levied on income derived from corporate earnings," [...] when in truth the stockholder has [...] "derived" [...] nothing except paper certificates which, so far as they have any effect, deny him [...] present participation in such earnings. It [...] contends that the tax may be laid when earnings [...] "are received by the stockholder," [...] whereas he has received none; that the profits are [...] "distributed by means of a stock dividend," [...] although a stock dividend distributes no profits; that under the Act of 1916 [...] "the tax is on the stockholder's share in corporate earnings," [...] when in truth a stockholder has no such share, and receives none in a stock dividend; that [...] "the profits are segregated from his [...] former capital, and he has a separate certificate representing his [...] invested profits or gains," [...] whereas there has been no segregation of profits, nor has he any separate certificate representing a personal gain, since the certificates, new and old, are alike in what they representa <b>capital</b> <b>interest</b> in the entire concerns of the corporation.|$|E
