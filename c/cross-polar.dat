50|$|The {{standard}} symmetrical, parabolic, Cassegrain reflector {{system is}} very popular in practice because it allows minimum feeder length to the terminal equipment. The major disadvantage of this configuration is blockage by the hyperbolic sub-reflector and its supporting struts (usually 3-4 are used). The blockage becomes very significant when {{the size of the}} parabolic reflector is small compared to the diameter of the sub-reflector.To avoid blockage from the sub-reflector asymmetric designs such as the open Cassegrain can be employed. Note however that the asymmetry can have deleterious effects on some aspects of the antenna's performance - for example, inferior side-lobe levels, beam squint, poor <b>cross-polar</b> response, etc.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the late}} 1940s Pan Am and other {{airlines}} had scheduled a few nonstop flights from New York to Europe, but westward nonstops against the prevailing wind were rarely possible with an economic payload. The L1049G and DC-7B {{that appeared in}} 1955 could occasionally make the westward trip, but in summer 1956 Pan Am's DC-7C finally started doing it fairly reliably. BOAC was forced to respond by purchasing DC-7Cs rather than wait on the delivery of the Bristol Britannia. The DC-7C {{found its way into}} several other overseas airlines' fleets, including SAS, which used them on <b>cross-polar</b> flights to North America and Asia. The DC-7C sold better than its rival, the Lockheed L-1649A Starliner, which entered service a year later, but sales were cut short by the arrival of Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 jets in 1958-60.|$|E

The <b>cross-polar</b> cap potential difference was set according to the relation Δ Φ = 26.4 + 13.3 × Kp (kV) (Feshchenko and Maltsev, 2003) at geomagnetic latitudes ± 75 °. Using the morphological results of Iijima and Potemra (1976) and Kikuchi et al.

We also have included the 30 min time delay of R 2 FAC variations with respect to the variations of the <b>cross-polar</b> cap potential difference during the storm (Kikuchi et al., 2008). The flux of precipitating auroral electrons is increased and their spectrum becomes harder with growth of geomagnetic activity.

The predicted and measured VSWR plots shown in Figure 4 showed an excellent impedance match, 1. 17 at a frequency of 1 GHz with usable bandwidth of 29 % at VSWR 2.

CONCLUSION This work has shown {{that it is possible to}} achieve fixed beam tilt with the use of a stepped-diameter circular-loop antenna without compromising VSWR. The antenna takes the form of a circular-wire loop antenna with 4 : 1 balun, and the reactive load was included by the increased wire diameter of a section of the loop circumference. Fixed beam steer of 7. 5 ° was achieved in the E field with a VSWR of only 1. 17 at a frequency of 1 GHz, and an operational bandwidth of 29 % for VSWR 2.
