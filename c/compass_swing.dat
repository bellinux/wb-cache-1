50|$|The Bore Sight Range and <b>Compass</b> <b>Swinging</b> Platform remain {{substantially}} {{intact and}} {{are important in}} demonstrating the principal characteristics of their types. The bore sight range retains its concrete hardstand, cleared range and earth butt. The circular concrete slab of the <b>compass</b> <b>swinging</b> platform remains adjacent to the wartime runway, and retains its compass rose inscription.|$|R
50|$|The Bore Sight Range and <b>Compass</b> <b>Swinging</b> Platform are a heritage-listed pair of {{aircraft}} testing facilities at Charters Towers Airport, Charters Towers, Charters Towers Region, Queensland, Australia. They were built from 1942 to 1943. They are {{also known as}} Charters Towers WWII Airfield Gun Firing Range and <b>Compass</b> <b>Swinging</b> Station. They {{were added to the}} Queensland Heritage Register on 14 May 2010.|$|R
50|$|Charters Towers Airport has a {{heritage}} listing for the Bore Sight Range and <b>Compass</b> <b>Swinging</b> Platform established during World War II.|$|R
50|$|The Bore Sight Range and <b>Compass</b> <b>Swinging</b> Platform at Charters Towers Airfield {{were listed}} on the Queensland Heritage Register on 14 May 2010 having {{satisfied}} the following criteria.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Compass</b> <b>Swinging</b> Platform {{is located}} about 850m {{south-east}} of the Bore Sight Range's hardstand (in the suburb of Columbia), {{on the northern}} side of the wartime NE- SW runway, near its central point. It comprises a circular concrete slab 120 feet 6 inches (36.7 metres) in diameter with a compass rose inscribed on the surface.|$|R
50|$|It was {{probably}} during this early period of 1943 that a <b>compass</b> <b>swinging</b> station, or platform, was constructed {{on the northern}} side of the NE-SW runway near its central point. No record of the date of construction has been located. The platform was a circular concrete slab, 120 feet 6 inches (36.7 metres) in diameter with a compass rose inscribed on its surface. Aircraft were pushed onto the platform and aligned {{with each of the}} 16 main cardinal points of the compass, starting with north. Variations in aircraft compass bearings were noted and compass magnets were adjusted.|$|R
50|$|Charters Towers Airfield was {{constructed}} for the United States Army in early 1942 to provide dispersal facilities {{for the main}} Townsville air base at Garbutt, {{in the event of}} Japanese air raids during World War II. During 1942 the US 3rd Bombardment Group was based at Charters Towers while undertaking strikes against Japanese bases in the south-west Pacific. From 1943 the airfield served as a US aircraft replacement and training centre. Facilities constructed during this period which remain include a bore sight range (a gun firing range used to check the alignment of the fixed guns of an aircraft) and a <b>compass</b> <b>swinging</b> station (used to check for magnetic deviation in an aircraft compass).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm for calibrating strapdown magnetometers in {{the magnetic field}} domain. In contrast to the traditional method of <b>compass</b> <b>swinging,</b> which computes a series of heading correction parameters and, thus, is limited to use with two-axis systems, this algorithm estimates magnetometer output errors directly. Therefore, this new algorithm {{can be used to}} calibrate a full three-axis magnetometer triad. The calibration algorithm uses an iterated, batch least squares estimator which is initialized using a novel two-step nonlinear estimator. The algorithm is simulated to validate convergence characteristics and further validated on experimental data collected using a magnetometer triad. It is shown that the post calibration residuals are small and result in a system with heading errors on the order of 1 to 2 degrees. ...|$|R
50|$|Gimbaled stove/compass-a {{pivoting}} {{apparatus that}} allows a stove or <b>compass</b> to <b>swing</b> in two planes {{at the same time}} so that it remains more or less level. This makes the compass needle steady and easier to read and allows food to be cooked (carefully) in seaway.|$|R
5000|$|An AGIR railway {{engineer}} at Rouen reported in 1943 unusual constructions in Upper Normandy, and Michel Hollard's report of September 1943 to the British Secret Intelligence Service identified six V-1 flying bomb facilities: [...] " [...] le Faubourg, , Totes, Ribeaucourt, Maison Ponthieu and Bois Carré". A more detailed report in October about Bois Carré claimed it had [...] "a concrete platform with centre axis pointing directly to London". AGIR reconnoitered 104 V-1 facilities and helped pinpointing the Watten bunker, the first V-2 launching site. AGIR also provided sketches of V-1 launching {{sites such as}} one by André Comps of Bois Carré (square woods) labeled [...] "La position de Maisons" [...] and B2. Hollard had the site infiltrated by Comps, who copied [...] "the blueprints"—a copy of the <b>compass</b> <b>swinging</b> building blueprint and the Bois Carré sketch were published in 1978.|$|R
6000|$|Then, {{as every}} one stared in blank amazement and nobody said anything, I {{found time to}} look about me, marveling at the oddly {{familiar}} appearance of the town. As I looked, the houses, streets, and everything seemed to undergo a sudden and mysterious transposition {{with reference to the}} points of the <b>compass,</b> as if <b>swinging</b> round on a pivot; and like one awakened from a dream I found myself among accustomed scenes. To be plain about it, I was back again in Swan Creek, as right as a trivet! ...|$|R
5000|$|If {{the true}} heading {{is set at}} the lubber's line, true {{bearings}} are observed directly. Similarly, compass bearings can be observed if the compass heading is set at the lubber's line, etc. However, the vessel must be on the heading to which the pelorus is set if accurate results are to be obtained, or else a correction must {{be applied to the}} observed results. Perhaps the easiest way of avoiding error is to have the steersman indicate when the vessel is on course. This is usually done by calling out [...] "mark, mark, mark" [...] as long as the vessel is within a specified fraction of a degree of the desired heading. The observer, who is watching a distant object across the pelorus, selects an instant when the vessel is steady and is on course. An alternative method is to have the observer call out [...] "mark" [...] when the relative bearing is steady, and the steersman note the heading. If the <b>compass</b> is <b>swinging</b> at the moment of observation, the observation should be rejected. The number of degrees between the desired and actual headings is added if the vessel is {{to the right of the}} course, and subtracted if to the left. Thus, if the course is 060° and the heading is 062° at the moment of observation, a correction of 2° is added to the bearing.|$|R
