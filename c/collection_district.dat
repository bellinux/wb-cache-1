6000|$|At the {{break-up}} {{of the great}} Rebellion I found myself at Selma, Alabama, still {{in the service of}} the United States, and although my duties were now purely civil my treatment was not uniformly so, and I am not surprised that it was not. I was a minor official in the Treasury Department, engaged in performance of duties exceedingly disagreeable not only to the people of the vicinity, but to myself as well. They consisted in the collection and custody of [...] "captured and abandoned property." [...] The Treasury had covered pretty nearly the entire area of [...] "the States lately in rebellion" [...] with a hierarchy of officials, consisting, as nearly as memory serves, of one supervising agent and a multitude of special agents. Each special agent held dominion over a <b>collection</b> <b>district</b> and was allowed an [...] "agency aide" [...] to assist him in his purposeful activity, besides such clerks, laborers and so forth as he could persuade himself to need. My humble position was that of agency aide. When the special agent was present for duty I was his chief executive officer; in his absence I represented him (with greater or less fidelity to the original and to my conscience) and was invested with his powers. In the Selma agency the property that we were expected to seize and defend as best we might was mostly plantations (whose owners had disappeared; some were dead, others in hiding) and cotton. The country was full of cotton which had been sold to the Confederate Government, but not removed from the plantations to take its chance of export through the blockade. It had been decided that it now belonged to the United States. It was worth about five hundred dollars a bale--say one dollar a pound. The world agreed that that was a pretty good price for cotton.|$|E

30|$|When {{analyzing}} {{and processing}} spatial data, several statistical problems may arise that are amplified by their visual representation in vulnerability maps. One {{of the most}} discussed issues {{is the definition of}} data <b>collection</b> <b>districts</b> or analytical spatial units. As for census data, the boundaries of the <b>collection</b> <b>districts</b> have to be constant, but the population may vary heavily; thus it is difficult to achieve homogeneity regarding population numbers or equality (King 2001; Fekete 2012), though some (theoretical) approaches have been proposed to overcome this difficulty (Openshaw 1984; Madelin et al. 2009). The arbitrariness of the analytical units’ definition is mostly pragmatically motivated, but may sometimes be politically motivated also. However, it almost inevitably leads to a statistical bias called “modifiable areal unit problem” (MAUP). The issue was described in detail by Openshaw (1984, p. 4): “Whereas census data are collected for essentially non-modifiable entities (people, households) they are reported for arbitrary and modifiable areal units (enumeration districts, wards, local authorities).” Recognition of the MAUP has resulted in a number of proposed solutions, such as interpolation and smoothing, the visualization of size effects in cartograms, gridding-methods, and interactive cartography (Madelin et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|Recruiting control {{subjects}} who {{are representative of}} the population from which the cases are drawn is a challenge in case–control studies. This paper examines the performance of random digit dialling (RDD) in obtaining a control sample, and the sample's representativeness of the population with respect to socio-economic status. The study subjects were recruited from 2003 to 2006 for a national, population-based case–control study investigating causes of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in children < 15 years of age in Australia. Control families' addresses were linked to Australian Bureau of Statistics Census 2006 <b>Collection</b> <b>Districts</b> and thus to Socio-Economic Indexes for Area scores, which are area-based measures of socio-economic status. These scores were compared with those of all <b>collection</b> <b>districts</b> where families lived. We estimate that 55 % of eligible families in the RDD sample {{agreed to participate in the}} study. Participation was directly related to socio-economic status with those of highest economic status most likely to participate. Completeness of participation in the components of data collection was similarly related to socio-economic status. This evidence of selection according to socio-economic status indicates that there may also be selection with respect to other factors potentially important in the aetiology of ALL...|$|R

This study investigated whether access to retail outlets is similar across areas of varying socioeconomic disadvantage in an Australian urban setting, in terms of distance, the numbers of local shops, and their opening hours. This ecological cross-sectional study used 50 randomly sampled census <b>collection</b> <b>districts</b> and their nearby shopping environment (i. e. within 2. 5 km), and generally found minimal or no socioeconomic differences in shopping infrastructure.

40|$|Background: Walkability {{describes}} {{the capacity of}} the built environment to support walking for various purposes. This paper {{describes the}} construction and validation of two objective walkability indexes for Sydney, Australia. Methods: Walkability indexes using residential density, intersection density, land use mix, with and without retail floor area ratio were calculated for 5, 858 Sydney Census <b>Collection</b> <b>Districts</b> in a geographical information system. Associations between variables were evaluated using Spearman’s rho (ρ). Internal consistency and factor structure of indexes were estimated with Cronbach’s alpha and principal components analysis; convergent and predictive validity were measured using weighted kappa (κw) and by comparison with reported walking to work at the 2006 Australian Census using logistic regression. Spatial variation in walkability was assessed using choropleth maps and Moran’s I. Results: A three-attribute abridged Sydney Walkability Index comprising residential density, intersection density and land use mix was constructed for all Sydney as retail floor area was only available for 5. 3 % of Census <b>Collection</b> <b>Districts.</b> A four-attribute full index including retail floor area ratio was calculated for 263 Census <b>Collection</b> <b>Districts</b> in the Sydney Central Business District. Abridged and full walkability index scores for these 263 areas were strongly correlated (ρ= 0. 93) and there was good agreement between walkability quartiles (κw= 0. 73). Internal consistency ranged from 0. 60 to 0. 71, and all index variables loaded highly on a single factor. The percentage of employed persons who walked to work increased with increasing walkability: 3. 0 % in low income-low walkability areas versus 7. 9 % in low income-high walkability areas; and 2. 1 % in high income-low walkability areas versus 11 % in high income-high walkability areas. The adjusted odds of walking to work were 1. 05 (0. 96 – 1. 15), 1. 58 (1. 45 – 1. 71) and 3. 02 (2. 76 – 3. 30) times higher in medium, high and very high compared to low walkability areas. Associations were similar for full and abridged indexes. Conclusions: The abridged Sydney Walkability Index has predictive validity for utilitarian walking, will inform urban planning in Sydney, and will be used as an objective measure of neighbourhood walkability in a large population cohort. Abridged walkability indexes may be useful in settings where retail floor area data are unavailable...|$|R
