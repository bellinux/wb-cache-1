25|$|I {{wanted to}} make a Flash Gordon movie, with all the trimmings, but I couldn't obtain the rights to the characters. So I began researching and went right back and found where Alex Raymond (who had done the {{original}} Flash Gordon comic strips in newspapers) had got his idea from. I discovered that he'd got his inspiration from the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of Tarzan) and especially from his John Carter of Mars series books. I read through that series, then found that what had sparked Burroughs off was a science-fantasy called , written by Edwin Arnold and published in 1905. That was the first story in this genre that I have been able to trace. Jules Verne had got pretty <b>close,</b> <b>I</b> suppose, but he never had a hero battling against space creatures or having adventures on another planet. A whole new genre developed from that idea.|$|E

According to musicologist Melanie Lowe, [...] "Spears shows a different side of her personality [...] than she does in her other songs." [...] Both of them also commented the song [...] "lacks rhythmic drive and the backing track is fuller, with smoother and rounder synthsized instruments", while describing Spears' vocals as more natural when compared to [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy".|$|E
500|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1850, Fuller wrote to a friend: [...] "It has long seemed that in the year 1850 I should stand on some important plateau in the ascent of life... I feel however no marked and important change as yet." [...] Also that year, Fuller wrote: [...] "I am absurdly fearful and various omens have combined {{to give me a}} dark feeling... It seems to me that my future upon earth will soon <b>close...</b> <b>I</b> have a vague expectation of some crisis—I know not what". A few days after writing this, Fuller, Ossoli, and their child began a five-week return voyage to the United States aboard the ship Elizabeth, an American merchant freighter carrying cargo that included mostly marble from Carrara. They set sail on May 17. At sea, the ship's captain, Seth Hasty, died of smallpox. Angelino contracted the disease and recovered.|$|E

500|$|Spears {{originally}} envisioned [...] "Sheryl Crow music, but younger more adult contemporary", {{but felt}} {{all right with}} her label's producers, since [...] "It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me." [...] The album opens with the first single [...] "...Baby One More Time", a teen pop and dance-pop song that begins with a three-note motif in the bass range of the piano. The opening was compared to many other songs, such as [...] "We Will Rock You" [...] (1977), [...] "Start Me Up" [...] (1981), [...] "These Words" [...] (2004) and the theme song of the film Jaws {{due to the fact}} the track [...] "makes its presence known in exactly one second". According to magazine Blender, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] is composed by [...] "wah-wah guitar lines and EKG-machine bass-slaps". Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, authors of Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide (2008), observed that the lyrics of the song [...] "gesture toward [...] longing for the return of an ex-boyfriend." [...] The next song and third single, [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy" [...] runs through a moderately slow dance beat, and has a rhythm and blues melody mixed with edgy synthesized instrumentals. The third track and second single [...] "Sometimes" [...] is a ballad, that Spears begins with [...] "You tell me you're in love with me/That you can't take your pretty eyes away from me/It's not that I don't wanna stay/But every time you come too <b>close</b> <b>I</b> move away". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted the song has [...] "a catchy hook and endearing melody, with a reminiscent euro-dance rhythm." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout her career, Ayola {{has been}} outspoken {{on the subject}} of racial {{discrimination}} in the entertainment industry. Describing her motivation, she states: [...] "I am not an overtly political person. I just want fairness". Ayola believes that black actors receive less recognition than their white counterparts, explaining; [...] "If you get a show with six stars and one is black you are more likely to see interviews with the five white actors. [...] They are not being sold as a reason to watch." [...] She believes that her career would have taken her in a different direction were she not of ethnic origin, stating: [...] "I could not have played any of the roles I have played on TV if I was white [...] I am very aware of where the glass ceiling is and it's still very low and expectations are still very low". She has noted having casting directors accept the notion of characters being both black and Welsh to be a particular problem, explaining that: [...] "I get offered a lot of very different roles, but they're never Welsh. [...] The one time I was asked to play a Welsh character on screen was in Tiger Bay for BBC Wales, but I know if that series had been called Radyr Park or Cyncoed <b>Close</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't have been in it". In 2001, Ayola founded a production company and directed a short film entitled Persephone's Playground. She presented the film at the Cannes film festival, using it as part of her campaign for increased black representation in theatre, films and television. The project, however, was largely unsuccessful, with Ayola stating: [...] "it just made me decide that if there's anything I don't want to do, it's produce films, because I'm rubbish at it. I was so bad with the budget that I just said yes to everything and then had to worry about how to pay for things at the end." [...] In 2008, Ayola offered her support to the [...] campaign Dignity! Period, aiming to provide affordable sanitary protection to Zimbabwean women.|$|E
