500|$|The {{anterior}} ASV is more anterior {{than the}} ASV and {{is outside the}} femoral vessels plan. The two veins terminate in a <b>common</b> <b>trunk</b> near the groin, the sapheno-femoral junction. Here, the ASV can be located [...] aligned with the femoral vessels at the [...] "alignment sign". Also, at the groin {{it can be seen}} at the outside of the great saphenous vein, and together with the common femoral vein (CFV) these three create an image, the so-called [...] "Mickey Mouse sign". Some authors, inspired by this sign (presented {{for the first time at}} CHIVA's 2002 meeting in Berlin), described a [...] "Mickey Mouse view" [...] at the groin, an image formed by the common femoral vein, the GSV and the superficial femoral artery. When the ASV is incompetent, its flow becomes retrograde and tries to drain in the superior fibular perforator, at the side of the knee, or sometimes it runs down towards the ankle to drain in the inferior fibular perforator.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND:Coronary artery (CA) stems {{connect the}} {{ventricular}} coronary tree with the aorta. Defects in proximal CA patterning are {{a cause of}} sudden cardiac death. In mice lacking Tbx 1, <b>common</b> arterial <b>trunk</b> is associated with an abnormal trajectory of the proximal left CA. Here we investigate CA stem development in wild-type and Tbx 1 null embryos. RESULTS:Genetic lineage tracing reveals that limited outgrowth of aortic endothelium contributes to proximal CA stems. Immunohistochemistry and fluorescent tracer injections identify a periarterial vascular plexus present {{at the onset of}} CA stem development. Transplantation experiments in avian embryos indicate that the periarterial plexus originates in mesenchyme distal to the outflow tract. Tbx 1 is required for the patterning but not timing of CA stem development and a Tbx 1 reporter allele is expressed in myocardium adjacent to the left but not right CA stem. This expression domain is maintained in Sema 3 c(-/-) hearts with a <b>common</b> arterial <b>trunk</b> and leftward positioned CA. Ectopic myocardial differentiation is observed {{on the left side of}} the Tbx 1 (-/-) <b>common</b> arterial <b>trunk.</b> CONCLUSIONS:A periarterial plexus bridges limited outgrowth of the aortic endothelium with the ventricular plexus during CA stem development.

40|$|ObjectiveA <b>common</b> {{arterial}} <b>trunk</b> is {{a solitary}} trunk that exits the heart through a common ventriculo-arterial junction and supplies directly the systemic, pulmonary, and coronary arterial pathways. It {{remains to be}} determined, however, how best to subclassify those hearts fulfilling this definition. The time-honored classification {{is based on the}} morphology of the pulmonary arteries, but an alternative approach also places emphasis {{on the nature of the}} systemic pathways. We evaluated our experience to establish whether these different approaches can be reconciled. MethodsWe examined 28 autopsied hearts with common arterial trunks; the specimens were drawn from the archives of three institutions. Based on our analysis, we simplified classification into hearts with aortic or pulmonary dominance. We used this approach to categorize 42 patients who had undergone surgical correction at Children’s Memorial Hospital in Chicago. ResultsAll autopsied hearts could be assigned to groups with either aortic or pulmonary dominance of the <b>common</b> arterial <b>trunk,</b> with 20 and 8 specimens, respectively, fitting into these categories. Pulmonary dominance was found only when the aortic component of the trunk was hypoplastic and an arterial duct supplied the majority of flow to the descending aorta. Only in this setting did we observe pulmonary arteries arising from the sides of the major pathway, and only in this setting was the aortic component discrete from the pulmonary component within the pericardial cavity. ConclusionsThis simple approach to classification reconciles the existing disparate categorizations of patients having <b>common</b> arterial <b>trunks</b> and it emphasizes the principal morphologic determinant of surgical outcome...|$|R

40|$|Elhmidi {{and colleagues}} {{are to be}} congratulated for the {{successful}} closure of a muscular ventricular septal defect by transventricu-lar placement of an expandable occlusion device under echocar-diographic guidance in their patient with <b>common</b> arterial <b>trunk.</b> 1 It is unusual {{that it is not}} possible to see evidence of the leaflets of the common truncal valve in any of the figures, which show the arrangement both before and after insertion of the occluder. The right-hand panel of Figure 3 is, perhaps, most instructive in this regard. As I interpret this figure, it shows the occluder is placed almost at the apex of the muscular ventricular septum. Could it be that our colleagues from Munich used the occluder to close an additional defect within the substance of the muscular septum and then closed the more usual juxta-arterial defect during the surgical repair of the <b>common</b> arterial <b>trunk?</b> If so, this is surely not quite the same thing as ‘‘transcatheter clo-sure’’? I would question the advisability of seeking to close, using a device inserted on a catheter, the directly juxta-arterial hole between the ventricles that is typically found in this setting. It seems likely that the workers from Munich used the transven-tricular approach to place a device in an apical muscular defect and then closed a juxta-arterial defect with a surgically placed patch in the course of repairing the <b>common</b> arterial <b>trunk</b> with cardiopulmonary bypass support. If so, then this should be stated clearly, lest others seek to emulate their achievement by choos-ing to close the juxta-arterial defect by means of catheter intervention...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESTo {{determine}} {{rates of}} reintervention after repair of <b>common</b> arterial <b>trunk</b> in the neonatal and early infant periods. BACKGROUNDWith improving {{success in the}} early treatment of <b>common</b> arterial <b>trunk,</b> the need for reinterventional procedures in older children, adolescents and adults will become an increasingly widespread concern {{in the treatment of}} these patients. METHODSWe reviewed our experience with 159 infants younger than four months of age who underwent complete primary repair of <b>common</b> arterial <b>trunk</b> at our institution from 1975 to 1998, with a focus on postoperative reinterventions. RESULTSOf 128 early survivors, 40 underwent early reinterventions for persistent mediastinal bleeding or other reasons. During a median follow-up of 98 months (range, 2 to 235 months), 121 reinterventions were performed in 81 patients. Actuarial freedom from reintervention was 50 % at four years, and freedom from a second reintervention was 75 % at 11 years. A total of 92 conduit reinterventions were performed in 75 patients, with a single reintervention in 61 patients, 2 reinterventions in 11 patients and 3 reinterventions in 3 patients. Freedom from a first conduit reintervention was 45 % at five years. The only independent variable predictive of a longer time to first conduit replacement was use of an allograft conduit at the original repair (p = 0. 05), despite the significantly younger age of patients receiving an allograft conduit (p < 0. 001). Reintervention on the truncal valve was performed on 22 occasions in 19 patients, including 21 valve replacements in 18 patients and repair in 1, with a freedom from truncal valve reintervention of 83 % at 10 years. Surgical (n = 29) or balloon (n = 12) reintervention for pulmonary artery stenosis was performed 41 times in 32 patients. Closure of a residual ventricular septal defect was required in 13 patients, all of whom underwent closure originally with a continuous suture technique. Eight of 16 late deaths were related to reintervention. CONCLUSIONSThe burden of reintervention after repair of <b>common</b> arterial <b>trunk</b> in early infancy is high. Although conduit reintervention is inevitable, efforts should be made {{at the time of the}} initial repair to minimize factors leading to reintervention, including prevention of branch pulmonary artery stenosis and residual interventricular communications...|$|R
