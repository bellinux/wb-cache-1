The DFT [92] and ab initio [93] calculations indicate that the CB of MWO 4 consists of W 5 d orbitals in tungstates, as in WO 3, while the O 2 p orbitals only comprise {{the upper part of}} the VB because the bivalent metal cation in tungstates contributes differently to the VB and <b>CB</b> <b>positions</b> given different outer electronic arrangements [55].|$|R

30|$|Desired photocatalysts {{should have}} a {{suitable}} band gap to achieve a high harvesting efficiency of sunlight, sufficient quantum yield, and an appropriate position of the band edge to trigger redox reactions [40, 41, 42]. For an ideal photocatalyst, the conduction band (CB) edge should be sufficiently negative to drive the photo-reduction reaction. In contrast, the valence band (VB) edge should be sufficiently positive to trigger the photo-oxidation reaction [43]. For example, in photocatalytic water splitting, when the VB edge position of the semiconductor photocatalyst is more positive than the potential of H 2 O/O 2 (1.23  V vs. NHE) and the <b>CB</b> <b>position</b> is more negative than the potential of H 2 /H 2 O (0  V vs. NHE), the water splitting reaction can occur [44, 45, 46, 47].|$|R

40|$|Thin-film {{solar cells}} based on Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 contain a thin buffer layer of CdS in their {{standard}} configuration. In {{order to avoid}} cadmium in the device for environmental reasons, Cd-free alternatives are investigated. In this thesis, ZnO-based films, containing Mg or S, grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD), are shown to be viable alternatives to CdS. The CdS is an n-type semiconductor, which together with the n-type ZnO top-contact layers form the pn-junction with the p-type Cu(In,Ga) Se 2. From device modeling {{it is known that}} a buffer layer conduction band (<b>CB)</b> <b>position</b> of 0 - 0. 4 eV above that of the Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 layer is consistent with high photovoltaic performance. For the Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 /ZnO interface this position is measured by photoelectron spectroscopy and optical methods to – 0. 2 eV, resulting in increased interface recombination. By including sulfur into ZnO, a favorable <b>CB</b> <b>position</b> to Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 can be obtained for appropriate sulfur contents, and device efficiencies of up to 16. 4 % are demonstrated in this work. From theoretical calculations and photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, the shift in the valence and conduction bands of Zn(O,S) are shown to be non-linear with respect to the sulfur content, resulting in a large band gap bowing. ALD is a suitable technique for buffer layer deposition since conformal coverage can be obtained even for very thin films and at low deposition temperatures. However, deposition of Zn(O,S) is shown to deviate from an ideal ALD process with much larger sulfur content in the films than expected from the precursor pulsing ratios and with a clear increase of sulfur towards the Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 layer. For (Zn,Mg) O, single-phase ZnO-type films are obtained for Mg/(Zn+Mg) < 0. 2. In this region, the band gap increases almost linearly with the Mg content resulting in an improved CB alignment at the heterojunction interface with Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 and high device efficiencies of up to 14. 1 %...|$|R

Using Factor Scores, each viewing point within 14 progressively changing positioning patterns, and 14 progressively changing height patterns were then plotted in a semantic space composed of the three dimensions : Pleasantness, Potency and Unity. Second, the viewing points were configured to two dimensional space by Multidimensional Scaling, and their relations were investigated. As a result of these anlyses, the influence on visual effects of changes of building lengths, the space width between buildings, building configulations, angular relationships between buildings and building heights were made clear...|$|R

40|$|Custom {{designed}} analogs of {{the natural}} anti-bacterial peptide cecropin B (CB) have been synthesized; cecropin B- 1 (CB- 1) was constructed by replacing the C-terminal segment (residues 26 to 35) with the N-terminal sequence of <b>CB</b> (<b>positions</b> 1 to 10 which include five lysine residues). The second analog, CB- 2, is identical to CB- 1 except for the insertion of a Gly-Pro residue pair between Pro- 24 and Ala- 25. These peptides were used to investigate their anti-liposome, anti-bacterial and anti-cancer activities. The strength of anti-liposome activity is reduced two-to three-fold when the analogs are used instead of natural CB based on DL 50 analysis. Similarly, the potency of these analogs on certain bacteria is about two-to four-fold {{lower than those of}} CB based on LC measurements. In contrast, on leukemia cancer cells, the potency of CB- 1 and CB- 2 is about two-to three-fold greater than that of natural CB based on IC 50 measurements. All CB, CB- 1 and CB- 2 peptides have comparable helix contents according to CD measurements. These results indicate that the designed cationic lytic peptides, having extra cationic residues, are less effective in breaking liposomes and killing bacteria but mon effective in lysing cancer cells. The possible interpretations for these observations are discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R

On the Packers first drive of the game they seemed to move the ball quite effectively and highlighted the drive with a 17-yard run by struggling RB Ryan Grant. However, on 3rd and 9 Ryan Grant was tackled for a 3-yard loss and the Packers were forced to punt. The Seahawks second drive of the game was another 3 and out and were again forced to punt. The Packers next drive was highlighted by a 7-yard pass to WR Donald Driver on 2nd and 6 {{as well as a}} nice 14-yard catch by rookie WR Jordy Nelson on 1st and 15. On 3rd and 10 on Seattle's 20-yard line Aaron Rodgers completed a 9-yard pass to Jordy Nelson which was marked a-yard short of the 1st down marker. Green Bay settled for the 29-yard Mason Crosby field goal to take a 3-0 lead.

40|$|Abstract: We {{compared}} structure alignments {{generated by}} several protein structure comparison programs {{to determine whether}} existing methods would satisfactorily align residues at a highly conserved position within an immunogenic loop in ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs). Using default settings, structure alignments generated by several programs (CE, DaliLite, FATCAT, LGA, MAMMOTH, MATRAS, SHEBA, SSM) failed to align the respective conserved residues, although LGA reported correct residue-residue (R-R) correspondences when the beta-carbon (<b>Cb)</b> <b>position</b> {{was used as the}} point of reference in the alignment calculations. Further tests using variable points of reference indicated that points distal from the beta carbon along a vector connecting the alpha and beta carbons yielded rigid structural alignments in which residues known to be highly conserved in RIPs were reported as corresponding residues in structural comparisons between ricin A chain, abrin-A, and other RIPs. Results suggest that approaches to structure alignment employing alternate point representations corresponding to side chain position may yield structure alignments that are more consistent with observed conservation of functional surface residues than do standard alignment programs, which apply uniform criteria for alignment (i. e. alpha carbon (Ca) as point of reference) along the entirety of the peptide chain. We present the results of tests that suggest the utility of allowing user-specified points of reference in generating alternate structural alignments, and we present a web server for automatically generating such alignments...|$|R
