5000|$|Saber is {{most famous}} for an {{exceptionally}} large piece {{he did on}} the <b>concrete</b> <b>bank</b> of the Los Angeles River in 1997. The full color piece took 97 gallons of paint and 35 nights spread out {{over the course of}} a year to complete. The final work, measuring 250 x 55 feet has been called [...] "the largest graffiti painting ever." [...] The work was viewable from satellite. Highly visible from the East LA interchange near downtown Los Angeles, it was seen by millions of drivers. A photo taken upon completion of the work shows the full scale; Saber can be seen sitting in the upper portion of the letter B, and above the <b>concrete</b> <b>bank</b> several trains show the relative length. The global reputation of the work within the graffiti world was further spread when that same photo was used as the splash screen for artcrimes.org, the first graffiti art website. In 2004, Saber recreated the piece in a diorama of the river for the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County exhibit, L.A.: light / motion / dreams. In 2007, the piece was included in the KCET project Departures: LA River. Remarkable not only for sheer size, Saber's LA River piece remained for 12 years. On September 1, 2009, a sub-contractor of the Army Corps of Engineers, BJD Resourcing, removed the work by painting over it.|$|E
5000|$|Because HUD had {{mandated}} for {{new developments}} {{to include a}} shopping center, Greenwald's partners built the present-day shopping center (originally called [...] "Towers Plaza"), which originally featured a two-story <b>concrete</b> <b>bank</b> building with windows that called back to the Lafayette Tower Penthouse and an L-shaped pedestrian mall. The bank building was demolished in 2002, despite historic district designation, and in the mid-2000s, the shopping center's appearance was changed {{to make it look}} more like the Mies townhouses. At all stages in its existence, the shopping center was a significant departure from Mies's original design, which featured a hat-shaped shopping center with parking adjoining Orleans and now the Dequindre Cut.|$|E

5000|$|Tivoli Pond {{is located}} in the {{circular}} plateau of the CR 3/1 (part) Tivoli arrangement area. The area is situated in the southwestern part of Tivoli Park in the immediate vicinity of the Cekin Mansion, along an avenue that was planted in the 1860s. On the western bank of the pond, there are two wooden peninsulas, frequently occupied by young people. A cafe operates at the northwestern end of the pond, in a half-wooden half-concrete building of a former changing-area. It is the only restaurant {{in this part of the}} park. On a lawn besides the pond, an open-air library operates in warm weather and a workshop on recycling books and other printed matter, called [...] "The Read Ones." [...] There is a small bronze plastic next to the middle of the western bank of the pond, named [...] ("Fish"). It is a depiction of two vertically standing fish, created by the expressionist sculptor France Kralj in 1935 and put in the pond in 1994. At the northern end of the pond stands a drinking fountain. Access to water is prevented by trees of the species such as the alder, the willow, the hornbeam, and shrubs. [...] In the vicinity, a staircase leads towards Tivoli Castle. On the steep eastern bank right next to the water grows the hornbeam, preventing erosion. On its upper edge, a wooden fence stands and a barberry hedge has been planted. Besides it, there is a footpath. Next to it, a children's playground has been arranged. On the southern bank, there are a <b>concrete</b> <b>bank,</b> two wooden peninsulas, marsh plants and climbers, a wooden fence and a paved lookout plateau behind it. There are also some shrub species.|$|E

40|$|Understanding money {{requires}} that we first grasp what makes money so significant—so valuable—to us. The article thus examines the sociology outlined by Geoffrey Ingham and criticises its ontology of money {{as a measure of}} value underpinned by state authority. By contrast, it argues that money ought to be primarily intended as value in itself. Accordingly, money’s most specific attribute is none of its canonical functions but rather purchasing power: the power not to pay, or else the power to buy time. The latter is not the mere product of state (fiscal) agency, but is entangled from the start with the production of liquidity and the construction of speculative markets for debt. Thus the paper emphasises the importance of <b>concrete</b> <b>bank</b> discounting vis-à-vis abstract accounting in concrete processes of monetisation, and shows how modern money, far from cancelling debts, is historically constructed within liquid financial relations so as to “buy time” and systematically procrastinate the final “rendering of accounts” for debtors. As a result, money cannot exist without the simultaneous existence of a debt that it will never discharge...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} Bachelor's Thesis is {{comparative}} analysis of non-bank loan institutions in the Czech Republic from the consumer perspective. It also intends to put them into context with other related topics and to evaluate the hypothesis of disadvantageousness of non-bank credits in comparison with bank credits. The theoretical part deals with financial literacy, differences between bank and non-bank institutions and results of previous qualitative research of their credit services. Attention is paid to the ethical problem represented by usury. Pawn shops and presentation events are mentioned as well. The thesis focuses on property seizure, personal bankruptcy and debt consultancy of non-profit organisations too. The practical part of the thesis contains comparison of selected non-bank institutions and comparison of a loan product of a <b>concrete</b> <b>bank</b> and one of non-bank company. The practical part also contains comparison of important non-profit debt counselling centres in the Czech Republic {{in terms of their}} services and their way of funding.

40|$|The {{main reasons}} and motivations which cause the {{withdrawal}} of Ukrainian popu lation’s money from deposit accounts at bank institutions are examined in the article. The author describes characteristics of savings behavior of Ukrainian citizens {{during the period of}} financial crisis. According to data of the “Tsentr” analytical group opinion poll (2009), the structure of population’s savings preferences has not gone through noticeable changes. Obtaining a positive savings experience as bank institu tions clients, people keep on considering such form of money savings as the best one. Even the fact that accounts of many Ukrainian depositors have been frozen at some credit and savings banks found on verge of bankruptcy did not ward them off. In such a case, people are disappointed rather in a <b>concrete</b> <b>bank</b> agency than in a hole banking system. The impacts which can attract the population’s deposit money to problematical banks after their “sanation” are also studied in the article. The author carries out an operational classification of motivational structure of population’s deposit activity. In particular, the deposit savings of population can serve not only as the mean of resolving both current and future financial problems, but as a kind of stabilizing factor regarding social and psychological state of a concrete person...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 53 - 55). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This thesis investigates the effects of urban development on two small streams near Madisonville, Texas. One stream is natural and used as a control against which Town Branch, the urbanized stream, is compared. Changes in width, depth, and channel capacity with drainage are evaluated for both creeks. When compared with the natural stream, the urbanized stream shows a complex response characterized by changes in capacity, width, and depth that are different from expected. These differences reflect the influences of urban features including earthen impoundments, <b>concrete</b> <b>bank</b> reinforcements, and encroachment of urban development. Channel capacities are larger than expected in the headwaters of the urbanized creek, but decreases through the urban area, before resuming a more natural trend in the lower reaches toward the basin outlet. Sediment analysis reveals possible disturbance of the natural trend due to urbanization. Overall, the results of this research show that channel responses to urbanization are spatially varied in Town Branch. These findings suggest that the management of urban channels needs to consider spatially distributed responses in the area around Madisonville, Texas, and elsewhere...|$|E
