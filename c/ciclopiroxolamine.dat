"Combining {{data from}} 2 trials of <b>ciclopiroxolamine</b> versus placebo found {{treatments}} failure rates of 61% and 64% for <b>ciclopiroxolamine.</b> These outcomes followed long treatment times (48 weeks) and this makes <b>ciclopiroxolamine</b> a poor choice for nail infections. Better results were observed {{with the use}} of amorolfine lacquer; 6% treatment failure rates were found after 1 month of treatment but these data were collected on a very small sample of people and these high rates of success might be unreliable." ...|$|E
5000|$|... ==Efficacy in {{treating}} nail infections== In addition to other formulations, ciclopirox {{is used in}} lacquers for topical treatment of onychomycosis (fungal infections of the nails). A meta-analysis of the six trials of nail infections available in 2009 concluded that they provided evidence that topical <b>ciclopiroxolamine</b> had poor cure rates and that amorolfine might be substantially more effective, but more research was required.|$|E
50|$|Therapy {{regarding}} deep {{fungal infections}} {{should be provided}} with amphotericin B therapy. Oral ketoconazole with topical enilconazole {{has been found to}} help treat skin lesions. Animal treatment is usually done with itraconazole or ketoconazole; most European countries use off label terbinafine in cats and dogs. However the most common antifungal drug used for systemic use is griseofulvin because it’s often the cheapest; treatment is usually on a common dose regimen of 50 mg per kg every twelve to twenty four hours. Most of these administered drugs are variants of imidazoles. The treatment of onychomycosis involves the administration of itraconazole with systemic griseofulvin in combination with topical enilconazole, sometimes a <b>ciclopiroxolamine</b> solution and systemic terbinafine is used. The mistreatment of fungal pathogens is due to the thought of bacterial infection and the administration of corticosteroids. This causes a change in appearance of the lesion and can lead to a harder diagnosis. Mycological examination should form the basis of diagnosis before the administration of antibiotics or corticosteroids.|$|E

The infection had a 2 -year history, occurring in {{the site of a}} nail trauma sustained in a fall from a horse.

40|$|Fifty dermatophyte strains, {{recently}} {{obtained from}} clinical material, belonging to 4 different species were examined for their susceptibility to 5 systemic or topical antimycotic agents using both an agar macrodilution and a broth microdilution test. Antimycotics compared were griseofulvin, itraconazole, sertaconazole, terbinafine and <b>ciclopiroxolamine.</b> A {{comparison of the}} minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) clearly showed {{differences between the two}} test methods applied. For all 5 antimycotics, MIC data were three- to seventyfold lower in the microdilution test system. These differences, depending on the test method, have {{to be taken into account}} when comparing MIC data in the literature or when relating the in vitro data to the tissue concentrations determined in vivo. ...|$|E
40|$|Cladophialophora boppii {{is a black}} yeast-like fungus that up to now {{has been}} only rarely {{described}} {{as a cause of}} human infection and whose role as a pathogen was not established despite its repeated isolation and genetic identification in these reports. Here we report the first case of a verified toenail infection caused by this fungus in a woman without any systemic disease or evidence of immunodeficiency. Identical dark molds were isolated from the same toenail at three points of time. Species identification was performed by scrutinizing the isolates morphologic, physiologic and genetic characteristics which resulted in their identification as Cladophialophora boppii. Oral treatment with terbinafin plus topical <b>ciclopiroxolamine</b> was effective. Read More: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Background {{the success}} of a {{dandruff}} treatment depends not only on the ability of a shampoo to control dandruff, but also on patient compliance, which is closely linked to the cosmetic attributes of the product. Aim the aim {{of this study was to}} compare efficacy, tolerance, and cosmetic properties of a LHA Shampoo [containing 0. 1 % lipohydroxy acid (LHA) and 1. 3 % salicylic acid] to a CPO shampoo [containing 1. 5 % <b>ciclopiroxolamine</b> (CPO), 3 % salicylic acid, and 0. 5 % menthol] in subjects with seborrheic dermatitis (SD) of the scalp. Methods One hundred subjects with mild to moderate scalp SD were randomized to receive either the LHA shampoo or the CPO shampoo every 2 days for 4 weeks. Efficacy and tolerance were evaluated at days 0, 14, and 28. Results the LHA and the CPO shampoo both decreased symptoms of scale, erythema, itching, cutaneous discomfort, and dryness from baseline to day 28. A higher percentage of patients showed improvement in the group treated with the LHA formulation than in the group treated with the CPO formulation, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. At day 28, the tolerance and the global efficacy of the LHA shampoo were significantly better (P = 0. 03 and P = 0. 01, respectively) than those of the CPO shampoo. Furthermore, the cosmetic acceptability was better or significantly better for all the endpoints evaluated for the LHA shampoo (P = 0. 02 for cleaning, P = 0. 04 for lathering). Conclusion in conclusion, these results demonstrated that the lipohydroxy acid shampoo evaluated in this study is a more convenient, efficient, safe, and well-tolerated cosmetic treatment for mild-to-moderate seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp than a <b>ciclopiroxolamine</b> shampoo.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIM: Prostate {{cancer is}} the most common cancer in the Western world. A bi-functional peptide was {{combined}} with wingless-related integration site (WNT) inhibitors to determine if there is an additive therapeutic effect when they are used against prostate cancer, since their efficacy has already been proven when used alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A bi-functional peptide (TP-LYT) was designed with a target domain (LTVSPWY) and a lytic domain (KLAKLAK) 2, and a second peptide with the same lytic domain but a random sequence instead of the target domain was used as a negative control. Two different WNT inhibitors were used, ethacrynic acid and <b>ciclopiroxolamine.</b> They were tested on prostate cancer cells using the WST- 8 assay. RESULTS: A synergistic effect of peptides and WNT inhibitors was demonstrated, increasing the toxicity against cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings potentially allow safer treatment since lower concentrations of WNT inhibitors can be used in combination with this bi-functional peptide...|$|E
40|$|Therapy {{of chronic}} {{recurrent}} vulvovaginal can- didiasis (VVC) caused by Candida glabrata is still rare {{in comparison to}} C. albicans infection, but therapy remains more difficult. Combination therapy with topical antifungals may improve therapy outcome, but still standard agents as fluconazole or itraconazole often fail. Posaconazole is a new systemic triazole with a wide antifungal spectrum including rare Candida species. Up to now, no clinical trials with posa- conazole in chronic recurrent VVC have been undertaken. Here, first results of {{the application of a}} new therapy regimen consisting of oral posaconazole in combination with topical <b>ciclopiroxolamine</b> are presented. 15 patients with chronic recurrent VVC caused by C. glabrata have been treated. 14 of these patients experienced successful therapy, clinical and mycological cure 30 days after begin of therapy has been observed. Long-term results are promising, as in 4 patients clinical and mycologic cure persists for more than 1 year up to now...|$|E
