40|$|This {{paper offers}} an ethical {{framework}} {{for the development of}} robots as home companions that are intended to address the isolation and reduced physical functioning of frail older people with capacity, especially those living alone in a noninstitutional setting. Our ethical framework gives autonomy priority in a list of purposes served by assistive technology in general, and carebots in particular. It first introduces the notion of “presence” and draws a distinction between humanoid multi-function robots and non-humanoid robots to suggest that the former provide a more sophisticated presence than the latter. It then looks at the difference between lower-tech assistive technological support for older people and its benefits, and contrasts these with what robots can offer. This provides some context for the ethical assessment of robotic assistive technology. We then consider what might need to be added to presence to produce care from a companion robot that deals with older people’s reduced functioning and isolation. Finally, we outline and explain our ethical framework. We discuss how it combines sometimes conflicting values that the design of a <b>carebot</b> might incorporate, if informed by an analysis of the different roles that can be served by a companion robot...|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} twenty-first century, we {{stand on the}} {{threshold}} of welcoming robots into domains of human activity that will expand their presence in our lives dramatically. One provocative new frontier in robotics, motivated by a convergence of demographic, economic, cultural, and institutional pressures, is the development of “carebots”—robots intended to assist or replace human caregivers in the practice of caring for vulnerable persons such as the elderly, young, sick, or disabled. I argue here that existing philosophical reflections on the ethical implications of <b>carebots</b> neglect a critical dimension of the issue: namely, the potential moral value of caregiving practices for caregivers. This value, I argue, gives rise to considerations that must be weighed alongside consideration of the likely impact of <b>carebots</b> on care recipients. Focusing on the goods internal to caring practices, I then examine the potential impact of <b>carebots</b> on caregivers by means of three complementary ethical approaches: virtue ethics, care ethics, and the capabilities approach. Each of these, I argue, sheds new light on the contexts in which <b>carebots</b> might deprive potential caregivers of important moral goods central to caring practices, as well as those contexts in which <b>carebots</b> might help caregivers sustain or even enrich those practices, and their attendant goods...|$|R
40|$|Growth of {{the elderly}} {{population}} and nursing shortage place increased pressure on our health care systems. One possible response is to let care robots or <b>carebots</b> take over care tasks. Some of these robots appear human in some way (humanoid robots), or look and act like a pet (pet robots). As personal robots they ‘share physical and emotional spaces with the user’ (Cerqui and Arras 2001) and {{play a role in}} daily life. They can assist ill and elderly people by monitoring them, by delivering drugs, by moving them around, by helping them with domestic tasks. They can be used for therapeutic aims, or to entertain and accompany people. How can we evaluate such a near-future scenario in terms of its contribution to ‘the good life’, given that <b>carebots</b> would often replace real humans or pets...|$|R
50|$|Also various robots {{have been}} {{developed}} to cater for increasing number of elderly persons. Examples include robots designed to elicit emotional responses or enhance communication such as robots Paro or Pepper as well as physical assistant robots, mobile servant robots, and person carrier robots. Those robots that are specifically designed to assist elderly people are also known as <b>carebots,</b> and their development has been heavily funded by the Japanese government.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Robots come in {{a variety}} of shapes and sizes, from {{manipulators}} in the industrial assembly line, to house cleaners, and to <b>carebots</b> of the elderly and sick. In recent years entertaining robots have been developed to engage adults and children into playing and learning. There are however no robots that have been specifically designed to entertain pets. The purpose of this paper is to present a prototype developed to engage pets into outdoor playing. Design/methodology/approach – A prototype that can engage a dog or a cat into playing was designed, built, and tested by a group of senior students. The enclosure of the prototype has the shape of a round shell. Within this shell there is a sensor interfacing unit, which can interpret sounds generated by the animals, and a light and sound system designed to interact with the animals. Findings – The testing results showed that the prototype was able to fulfill requirements for outdoor playing, such as being waterproof and able to travel through grass. Testing of the individual sensor interfacing circuits demonstrated the interactive capability. Dogs were chosen to be the subjects to be entertained. However, it is envisioned that a smaller version of this prototype can be suitable for cats. Originality/value – This is the first prototype that explores ways to entertain pets when their human owners are absent or busy. The prototype developed is a good start for any intelligent robotic systems specifically designed to entertain pets...|$|R
