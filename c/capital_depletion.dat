5000|$|If the {{degradation}} of natural and social capital has such important consequence the question arises why action is not taken more systematically to alleviate it. Cohen and Winn point to four types of market failure as possible explanations: First, while the benefits of natural or social <b>capital</b> <b>depletion</b> can usually be privatised, the costs are often externalised (i.e. they are borne not by the party responsible but by society in general). Second, natural capital is often undervalued by society since we are not {{fully aware of the}} real cost of the depletion of natural capital. Information asymmetry is a third reason—often the link between cause and effect is obscured, making it difficult for actors to make informed choices.

40|$|Includes bibliographyWithin Latin America, Uruguay {{stands out}} by its equalitarian income distribution, the {{solidity}} of its democratic institutions, and its {{level of social}} integration. Over the last decade, however, there have been signs of cracks in this desirable image which adversely affect the harmony of social relations. These cracks {{take the form of}} marginal behaviour: i. e., types of behaviour which are not governed by socially accepted patterns. In this study, the explanation for these types of behaviour has been sought in the divergences between cultural goals, the structures of opportunities for attaining those goals, and the shaping of individual capacities for taking advantage of them. A central premise of the approach adopted is that the factors determining marginal forms of behaviour build up their effects in a cyclical manner throughout the different stages of individual lives and from generation to generation. In view of this cyclical character, no decisions on the priorities to be followed in tackling situations of marginality can be fully effective unless an overall view is taken. Hence, the design of an integrated social policy that seeks to restore the links of marginal persons with society must, at the very least: i); assemble the fullest possible picture of situations of marginality {{in the course of a}} person's life; ii); identify, in each stage, the conditions that help to build up and consolidate marginality, and iii); identify points of intervention which, because of their cost-benefit ratios, are of crucial importance for breaking the links that make possible the individual accumulation and intergenerational reproduction of situations of marginality. The article highlights the differences between poverty and marginal poverty, not because it assumes that marginality is confined to the poor, but because it is in that sector that the forms of marginality of greatest individual and social cost are concentrated. It is suggested that the key element in this differentiation is social <b>capital,</b> the <b>depletion</b> of which is due mainly to the break-up of the family and to processes of segmentation such as housing segregation [...] the most extreme example of which is the shanty towns [...] and deterioration of the integrative function of the educational system...|$|R

40|$|The {{adjusted}} {{net saving}} rate, initially {{known as the}} genuine saving rate, was first published by the World Bank in the late 1990 s as a more comprehensive measure of national saving and one more indicative of sustainable development. The adjusted net saving rate incorporated not just physical capital depreciation, but natural <b>capital</b> <b>depletion</b> and environmental damage, as well as including some human capital formation. In this paper, using a cross‐section of developing economies for 2001 – 2006, determinants of the adjusted net saving rate are estimated. For comparison, the same determinants for the gross national saving rate are estimated. Also, a basic Solow growth model is extended to incorporate natural resources and to justify a more comprehensive measure of savings, such as the adjusted net saving rate, for modeling economic growth. The two measures of savings are then compared as determinants in estimations of economic growth. Understanding the determinants of the adjusted net saving rate is useful for policies to promote sustainable development. sustainable development, adjusted net saving rate, genuine saving rate, economic growth, Q 01, E 21, O 47, O 57,...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{resources}} are typically subject both to taxation under {{the income tax}} system and to special resource taxes. Properly designed income taxes attempt to include capital income on a uniform basis. But in most countries the income tax treats resource industries more favorably than most other industries - through favorable treatment of such <b>capital</b> expenses as <b>depletion,</b> exploration and development, {{and the cost of}} acquiring resource properties. The case for special resource taxes is precisely to tax resource rents over and above the levies implicit in general income taxes. There are two justifications for this: (a) the efficiency-based argument that a tax on resource rents is nondistorting and complementary; and (b) the equity argument that the property rights to resources ought to accrue to the public at large rather than to private citizens since the rents represent the bounty nature has bestowed on the economy rather than a reward for economic effort. If the main purpose of a resource tax is to capture rents for the public sector, the base of resource taxes should be economic rents (or their present value equivalent), contend the authors. Actual resource taxes differ from rent taxes in significant ways. Unlike a general income tax - which allows the resource industries to understate capital income - resource taxes often overstate rents. This is because they typically do not offer full deductions for all costs, especially capital costs. Some systems tax revenues without allowing any deductions for costs; others allow the deduction of current costs only. As a result, they discourage investment activity in resource industries, encourage the exploitation of high-grade relative to low-grade resources, and make it difficult to impose high tax rates for fear of making the marginal tax rate higher than 100 percent. The authors discuss three alternative ideal ways for the government to divert a share of rents to the public sector: levy a tax on rents, ideally {{in the form of a}} cash flow tax; require firms to bid for the rights to exploit resources; and take a share of equity in the firm. They discuss these options in terms of their implications for the ability of firms to obtain finance, the allocation of risk, the share of rents accruing to the public sector, the extent of involvement of foreign firms, and other factors. The time has come in many countries, they say, when gains from further refinement of imperfect existing taxes on {{resources are}} less than replacing them with simpler, more efficient forms of pure rent taxes.

40|$|Resource {{management}} {{has been an}} important area of development economics for the last few decades as, a growing number of countries to large extent have relied on natural resource rent. These resources, namely, oil and later gas have been the major growth factor of the Azerbaijani economy since the sign of the country s first biggest oil contract in 1994. Significant revenue flow led to remarkable growth rate in mid 2000 s but also causing contractions in the non-oil sector. Although the share of oil sector was expanding gradually before the establishment of the state oil fund, SOFAZ has become the crucial part of the economy with an upsurge of lump sum transfers which is still following an unconstrained expenditure pattern. The government aimed to increase the socio-economic performance by injecting the oil proceeds to the economy via annual state budget expenditures. This type of policy is arguably consistent with economic literature which advocates the use of resource rent domestically, generally, in the form of public investment with proper administrative and institutional arrangements to assure long run sustainability of growth in capital scarce developing countries. This thesis aims to discuss the Azerbaijani case, thereby answering questions how, through what channels, those arrangements have been successful and to what extent the spending of the large oil revenues contributed to non-oil economic growth. As the resource rent constitutes the largest share of the revenue source of the public expenditure, the thesis presents the investment strategy of SOFAZ along with the governance issues and then compares it with two other wealth funds to make relevant appraisals over international practices in administrative and value creation contexts. The comparison shows that SOFAZ s investment strategy is inefficient in terms of its risk choices and there are no prospects that oil proceeds can be replaced with <b>capital</b> income upon <b>depletion</b> of the natural resources. The thesis further investigates how far the petroleum sector has been involved in economic progress, whether announced and implemented policies match and what future perspectives look like in the light of current economic situation. Inspection of the fiscal budget formulations reveals some important information. It turns out that the initially declared spending rule has not been followed and also the amount of transfers has become the major fiscal instrument for the government. Moreover, the disaggregation of total tax revenues shows that the share of the oil sector in state budget formulation as well as in GDP is much higher than those that are shown in government s annual reports. A gradual decrease in production accompanied by increase in transfers to the state budget {{in order to meet the}} non-oil primary deficit will exhaust reserves of SOFAZ much faster thereby leaving no scope for upholding consumption profile. The spending of the resource rent is intended to affect the growth of non-oil sector positively. As there is no previous empirical work discussing the government expenditure and its impacts on growth rate of Azerbaijani non-oil aggregate output, the thesis presents empirical method to capture this relationship by use of time-series data over 1994 - 2014. Although Johansen cointegration tests shows no long run relations among the variables of interest thereby rejecting the use of vector error correction model (VECM) using a vector autoregressive (VAR) model exhibits the short run causality among government expenditure, exports and non-oil economic growth. The results of the Granger Causality tests with single lag choice indicate no causality running from government expenditure towards the non-oil economic growth at 10 % significance level. Furthermore, non-oil GDP growth is found to affect the government expenditure at the 5 % significance intervals thereby demonstrating the signs of Wagner s law for the Azerbaijani economy. It should also be noted that the VAR analyses, in general, are able to capture approximate relations of the variables of interest...|$|R
40|$|D. Comm. (Economic and Management Sciences) The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to examine the}} dynamics of Mexico's external economic relations during the period 1968 - 1995. Since the early seventies, the workings of the international monetary system has been governed Illore by implicit rules and conventions based on sound market principles than rules as were the case under the fixed exchange rate system of Bretton Woods. These "rules of the game" dictated that if a country {{wanted to be part of}} the global village and reap the benefits thereof, such a country should adhere to market forces and administer its monetary-fiscal policy in such a way as to ensure that the delicate balance between the domestic and international economic environment is maintained. In the event of a deviation from these rules, a country, in this instance Mexico, would fmd itself in a. position where it is heavily penalised for not playing according to the rules of the game. Starting in 1976, the Mexican economy was characterised by ongoing exchange rate crises, which seemed to be a recurring phenomenon repeating itself more or less every six years. Time and again a misalignment in Mexico's monetary-fiscal policy led to a build-up of pressures and tensions in the external accounts of the country, especially the balance of payments and eventually disruption of the economic growth process and relations with the external world. The Mexican economy was time and again subject to a rapidly growing current account deficit, rising external foreign debt, a rising overall fiscal deficit fuelled by - xiii - expansionary government expenditure policies and the slavish adherence to a fixed exchange rate regime. The growing fiscal deficit was in all instances financed by either increased short-term, highly volatile portfolio <b>capital,</b> or a <b>depletion</b> of the country's gold and foreign reserve holdings. The discovery of large oil reserves in 1978 lessened the need for structural adjustment and the following of more prudent policy measures. Rising domestic inflation and the fixed exchange rate gave rise to an ongoing real appreciation of the peso, which undermined the competitiveness of the domestic economy and distorted the balance between domestic savings and consumption. The appreciation of the peso and the high import propensity of the domestic households led to sharp increases in imports and rather static export earnings. The vulnerability of the domestic economy was exacerbated by developments in the country's external environment. These exogenous shocks took the form of either a decline in the international oil-prices and/or a more hostile international financing environment characterised by higher. interest rates and stricter borrowing requirements. The combination of domestic financial tensions and negative developments in the country's external environment were often, especially in 1994, accompanied by domestic political upheavals.. Time and again the apparent unsustainable domestic and external disparities and the heavy reliance on speculative foreign funding led to a change in investor views of the future of the Mexican peso. Capital flights and continued speculation eventually led to a situation where the authorities could no longer manage to maintain the parity of the peso. The market subsequently forced a devaluation and/or depreciation of the peso. The exchange rate crises of 1976, 1982, 1986 - 87 and 1994 appear to have been the result of a monetary-fiscal policy stance in which the government played a relatively central role. The role of the government and its hold over the Bank of Mexico led to a situation where the Mexican economy was out of touch with developments in its external economic and financial environment. Interesting though, is the way in which the government, especially the Salinas administration, refused to follow a more marketoriented macroeconomic policy with reference to the exchange rate regime and monetary-fiscal policy in general. As the events that led to the collapse of the peso in - XIV - 1994 unfolded, it became evident that the overvalued peso was maintained solely for non-economic reasons. The manner in which the new Zedillo administration reacted to the sharp depreciation of the peso in 1994 and 1995 greatly influenced the further deterioration of the peso and Mexico's international position. The main {{objective of}} the international assistance provided to Mexico by the United States, the International Monetary Fun~ and other international institutions during the course of 1995 was to underpin the continued deterioration of the peso and the overall well-being of the Mexican economy. Although the Mexican authorities are bound by the conditions tied to the foreign fmancial assistance provided and are at this stage following a more market-oriented, less regulated economic policy, it remains to be seen whether the authorities will in future adhere more closely to the rules of the game of the international monetary system as embodied in the conventions dictated by the global village market...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{importance}} of the SME sector is recognized worldwide. The contribution of this sector is particularly important for the achievement of several socio-economic goals such as employment generation, contribution to national production and exports, and encouraging entrepreneurship. However, the access of SMEs to financial resources is rather limited. Financing {{has been a problem}} that troubles SMEs for a long time, which restrains them from sustainable development and international competitiveness in the long run. As a result, a common challenge for all governments and financial institutions address the questions: how to provide enough financial support to SMEs, facilitate access to the necessary finance, how to innovate financing pattern and promote their sustainable development. Nowadays, the problem of financing SMEs is further exacerbated as a result of serious financial and economic crises facing the world economy. The current global economic crisis has resulted in <b>capital</b> <b>depletion,</b> risk aversion and credit contraction. Since the financial market can not function properly as a source of funding, and the credit crisis continues to increase pressure on the cost of financing, companies are now left with virtually no access to finance, which seriously undermines their survival and development. In the case of small and medium enterprises, the situation is even worse. Many small and medium enterprises will be forced to go bankrupt, due to lack of finance. Therefore, financing of SMEs is a pressing issue for all economies, particularly developing economies, like ours. Key words: financial crisis, SME, problems, financing...|$|E

We have established the strategic models by which the enterprises could be ranked following the change of ownership or management. From among the four types, the asset depleting and the surviving strategies are definitely disadvantageous, but they {{accounted for more than}} 56 % of the cases. The frequency of occurrence of the negative strategic models increased remarkably {{in the second half of}} the period between 1992 and 2006, while the occurrence of the positive strategies – optimising and push forward – dropped to half. It was established that any available reserves of the Hungarian food industrial structure were exhausted in the actual social and economic environment. Withdrawal of foreign capital from the country will continue. A further decrease of the registered <b>capital,</b> <b>depletion</b> of the assets and deterioration of the competitiveness are unavoidable. In the short term, supporting retention of the foreign capital, while in the medium and long term, encouraging expansion of the small and medium size enterprises may grant the opportunity for improvement. food industry, structure, ownership, capital, strategic model Introduction, Industrial Organization, Institutional and Behavioral Economics,...|$|E
40|$|The rate {{at which}} the Earth’s surface {{receives}} high-utility energy from the Sun is 11, 000 times as great as the {{rate at which}} humans use commercial energy. Despite this, 88 percent of the commercial energy used comes from non-renewable, fossil-fuel sources. Fossil fuel use each year adds 3 percent more carbon-dioxide to the atmosphere than natural sinks can remove. The task for humans is to find ways to obtain utility from a greater portion of solar radiation. The one natural process that achieves this goal is photosynthesis, which is neutral to carbon-dioxide accumulation and which provides all the human food on Earth. Past efforts to enhance the productivity of human-managed photosynthesis systems have involved energy inputs in non-solar forms – mainly from fossil fuel sources – causing such systems to be non-sustainable from the long-term perspective. There exist both technological and sociological opportunities to make non-fossil-fuel energy more economically feasible. These include accounting systems that link costs associated with atmospheric pollution avoidance and with natural <b>capital</b> <b>depletion,</b> to the market prices of fossil fuels, and also include the use of information-intensive processes (so that less energy of any type is needed) to manage high-productivity photosynthetic systems. The long-term goal is to bring high productivity achievement to all the World’s citizens, while using sustainable energy forms. This productivity level is expected to be associated with reduced rates of population increase and with increased attention to global pollution reduction. Resumen...|$|E
40|$|Forests {{contribute}} to the economy in several ways. While forests {{are a source of}} timber with market values, they also influence local and regional climate, preserve soil cover on site, {{and in the case of}} watersheds, protect soil downstream from floods –functions, which are not in the production boundary of SNA. Further, the net value added in forestry sector does not reflect sustainability of forest resources, because it ignores the consumption of natural <b>capital</b> (<b>depletion)</b> that occurs when forests are harvested or converted to other uses. The only costs of depletion considered in the national accounts are the extraction costs and records the potential loss in forest wealth as other changes in assets that have no effect on Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The study tries to incorporate forest resources into the national accounts and adjust the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the depletion of forest capital, using the Satellite System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA). The value of net accumulation (positive or negative) of forests is calculated and the net Domestic Product is adjusted for the depletion of the forest resources to get Environment adjusted Domestic Product (EDP). The results show that the EDP equals 98. 4 % of the adjusted net domestic product in 1993 – 1994. A proper accounting framework would better reflect not only the long term value of the state's natural wealth but also its immediate contribution to the state economy in the current accounts.

40|$|The {{scientific}} {{data about the}} state of our planet, presented at the 2012 (Rio+ 20) summit, documented that today's human family lives even less sustainably than it did in 1992. The data indicate furthermore that the environmental impacts from our current economic activities are so large, that we are approaching situations where potentially controllable regional problems can easily lead to uncontrollable global disasters. Assuming that (1) the majority of the human family, once adequately informed, wants to achieve a "sustainable way of life" and (2) that the "development towards sustainability" roadmap will be based on scientific principles, one must begin with unambiguous and quantifiable definitions of these goals. As will be demonstrated, the well known scientific method to define abstract and complex issues by their negation, satisfies these requirements. Following this new approach, it also becomes possible to decide if proposed and actual policies changes will make our way of life less unsustainable, and thus move us potentially into the direction of sustainability. Furthermore, if potentially dangerous tipping points are to be avoided, the transition roadmap must include some minimal speed requirements. Combining the negation method and the time evolution of that remaining natural capital in different domains, the transition speed for a "development towards sustainability" can be quantified at local, regional and global scales. The presented ideas allow us to measure the rate of natural <b>capital</b> <b>depletion</b> and the rate of restoration that will be required if humanity is to avoid reaching a sustainable future by a collapse transition.

40|$|In {{recent years}} economists have {{recognized}} that, along with physical and human capital, environmental resources {{should be viewed}} as important economic assets, which can be called natural capital. However, the services provided by natural capital are unique. They include the use of resources for material and energy inputs, the "assimilative capacity" to absorb waste, and the provision of ecological services. The latter services are particularly not well understood, and {{lie at the heart of}} the debate over the role of natural capital in sustainable development. That is, does the environment have a unique or "essential" role in sustaining human welfare, and if so, are special "compensation rules" required to ensure that future generations are not made worse off by natural <b>capital</b> <b>depletion</b> today? A further debate has emerged over whether environmental degradation in an economy may initially increase, but eventually declines, as per capita income increases. This hypothesis, called the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) has led to a number of attempts to estimate empirically an "inverted U" shaped relationship between a variety of indicators of environmental pollution or resource depletion and the level of per capita income. Finally, recent economic theories and empirical evidence have questioned whether poorer economies that are endowed with abundant natural resources develop more rapidly than economies that are relatively resource poor. It is possible that resource abundant economies are not reinvesting the rents generated from natural resource exploitation into productive assets, or that resource booms actually divert economic resources from more productive and innovative sectors. The result is a "boom and bust" pattern of economic development. There is evidence of this phenomenon particularly with regard to economic development and land expansion, especially in Latin America. Overall, although our understanding of the role of natural resources in economic development has improved markedly in recent decades, there is still much to learn. How natural resource depletion is affecting the ecological services provided by the environment is one concern. In the case of the poor economies, there is increasing evidence that their prospects for economic "take off" are being adversely affected by the lack of efficient and sustainable management of their natural resource base. Yet the "underpricing" and "undervaluing" of natural capital makes it difficult to design appropriate policies for ensuring that natural resource rents are reinvested in other productive assets of the economy.
