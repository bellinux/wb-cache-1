5000|$|The {{engine thrust}} acts along the engine centreline. The {{aircraft}} [...] "holds" [...] the engine {{on the outer}} <b>casing</b> of the <b>engine</b> at {{some distance from the}} engine centreline (at the engine mounts). This arrangement causes the <b>engine</b> <b>casing</b> to bend (known as backbone bending) and the round rotor casings to distort (ovalization). Distortion of the engine structure has to be controlled with suitable mount locations to maintain acceptable rotor and seal clearances and prevent rubbing. A well-publicized example of excessive structural deformation occurred with the original Pratt & Whitney JT9D engine installation in the Boeing 747 aircraft. The engine mounting arrangement had to be revised with the addition of an extra thrust frame to reduce the casing deflections to an acceptable amount.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of propulsion engine systems {{is sensitive to}} weight and volume considerations. This can severely constrain the configuration {{and complexity of the}} control system hardware. Distributed Engine Control technology is a response to these concerns by providing more flexibility in designing the control system, and by extension, more functionality leading to higher performing engine systems. Consequently, there can be a weight benefit to mounting modular electronic hardware on the <b>engine</b> core <b>casing</b> in a high temperature environment. This paper attempts to quantify the in-flight temperature constraints for <b>engine</b> <b>casing</b> mounted electronics. In addition, an attempt is made at studying heat soak back effects. The Commercial Modular Aero Propulsion System Simulation 40 k (C-MAPSS 40 k) software is leveraged with real flight data as the inputs to the simulation. A two-dimensional (2 -D) heat transfer model is integrated with the engine simulation to approximate the temperature {{along the length of the}} <b>engine</b> <b>casing.</b> This modification to the existing C-MAPSS 40 k software will provide tools and methodologies to develop a better understanding of the requirements for the embedded electronics hardware in future engine systems. Results of the simulations are presented and their implications on temperature constraints for <b>engine</b> <b>casing</b> mounted electronics is discussed...|$|R

40|$|A thermal tip {{clearance}} control system provides a robust and flexible means of manipulating the closure between the casing and the rotating blade tips in a jet engine, reducing undesirable tip leakage flows. This may be achieved using an impingement cooling scheme on the external <b>casing</b> of the <b>engine</b> in conjunction with careful thermal management of internal over-tip seal segment cavity. For a reduction in thrust specific fuel consumption, the mass flow rate of air used for cooling must be minimised, be at as low a pressure as possible and delivered through a light weight structure surrounding the rotating components in the turbine. This thesis first characterises {{the effectiveness of a}} range of external impingement cooling arrangements in typical <b>engine</b> <b>casing</b> closure system. The effects of jet-to-jet pitch, number of jets, inline and staggered alignment of jets, arrays of jets on flange, on an <b>engine</b> representative <b>casing</b> geometry are assessed through comparison of the convective heat transfer coefficient distributions in a series of numerical studies. A baseline case is validated experimentally. The validation data allowed the suitability of different turbulence closure models to be assessed using a commercial RANS solver. Importantly for each configuration the thermal contraction of an idealised <b>engine</b> <b>casing</b> is predicted using thermo-mechanical finite element models, at a series of operating conditions representing engine idle to maximum take-off conditions. Cooling is provided by manifolds attached to the outside of the engine. The assembly tolerance of these components leads to variation in the standoff distance between the manifold and the casing. For cooling arrangements with promising performance, the study is extended to characterise the variation in closure with standoff distance. It is shown that where a sparse array of non-interacting jets is used the system can be made tolerant of large build misalignments. The casing geometry itself contributes to the thermal response of the system, and, in an additional study, the effect of casing thickness and circumferential thermal control flanges are investigated. Restriction of the passage of heat into the flanges was seen to be dramatically change their effectiveness and slight necking of the flanges at their root was shown to improve the performance disproportionally. High temperature secondary air flowing past the internal face of the <b>engine</b> <b>casing</b> tends to heat the casing, causing it to grow. Experimental and numerical characterisation of a heat transfer within a typical over-tip segment cavity heat transfer is presented in this thesis for the first time. A simplified modelling strategy is proposed for casing and a means to reduce the casing heat pickup by up to 25 % was identified. The overall validity of the modelling approach used is difficult to validate in the engine environment, however limited data from a test engine temperature survey became available {{during the course of the}} research. By modelling this engine {{tip clearance}} control system it was shown that good agreement to the temperature distribution in the <b>engine</b> <b>casing</b> could be achieved where full surface external heat transfer coefficient boundary conditions were available. </p...|$|R

40|$|Mapped wave-envelope {{elements}} of variable radial order are presented for the computation of time-harmonic, unbounded, three-dimensional acoustical fields.
