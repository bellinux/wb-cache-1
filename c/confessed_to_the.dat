5|$|The {{police were}} {{initially}} aware {{of only three}} killings, those of Edward Evans, Lesley Ann Downey and John Kilbride.

5|$|Although Brady and Hindley had <b>confessed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{murders of}} Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) decided {{that nothing would}} be gained by a further trial; as both were already serving life {{sentences}} no further punishment could be inflicted, and a second trial might even have helped Hindley's case for parole by giving her a platform from which to make a public confession.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} a six-day trial, she {{was convicted}} and sentenced to death after a jury of matrons {{rejected}} her last-minute attempt to avoid the death penalty by pleading pregnancy.

The case attracted huge public interest and was widely covered by the press in Great Britain and Ireland.

A non-commissioned officer later <b>confessed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crimes and was found guilty, but an officer who claimed he had only been following orders was acquitted.|$|E

A suspect was arrested in October 2012 and publicly <b>confessed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> murder, while the Mexican authorities concluded that the motive of the murder was theft. But the suspect later retracted his confession and stated that he had been tortured and threatened by officials to lie and admit to the murder. Investigators have relied solely on the suspect's confession to incriminate him; the DNA and fingerprint samples collected at the murder scene did not match the suspect's according to sources close to Committee to Protect Journalists.|$|E

A similar explosive had detonated 50 minutes earlier at King's Cross. The Metropolitan Police had received a three-minute warning and were unable to evacuate the station completely, but British Transport Police evacuated much of the area just before the explosion. In 1974, the mentally ill Judith Ward <b>confessed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bombing and was convicted of this and other crimes despite the evidence against her being highly suspect and Ward retracting her confessions. She was acquitted in 1992, and the culprit has not been found.|$|E
5|$|Garza, {{troubled by}} what he had done, <b>confessed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> police that he acted as a {{middleman}} in Fischer's murder.

Cisneros and Garza were eventually {{sentenced to life in}} prison by a state court in 1994, but Cisneros' sentence was overturned due to a legal technicality. She was convicted again in 1998 by a federal court and {{sentenced to life in prison}}. Martínez was given a 20-year sentence after pleading guilty and testifying against the two in court. Though U.S. officials tried to have the two assassins extradited, the hitmen never faced trial in Texas. They were prosecuted in Mexico and given a 15-year sentence.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, {{when the}} Duchess {{was staying at}} Ednam Lodge, {{the home of the}} Earl of Dudley, some of her jewels were stolen. There were rumours that the theft had been masterminded by the royal family as an attempt to regain jewels taken from the Royal Collection by the Duke, or by the Windsors {{themselves}} as part of an insurance fraud—they made a large deposit of loose stones at Cartier the following year. However, in 1960, career criminal Richard Dunphie <b>confessed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crime. The stolen pieces were {{only a small portion of}} the Windsor jewels, which were either bought privately, inherited by the Duke, or given to the Duke when he was Prince of Wales.|$|E

B. indicated that he understood and then proceeded to provide further details about the crime, including the location of the stolen property. J. D. B. wrote a statement at the investigator's request. He was allowed to leave to catch the bus home.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Desha left Kentucky {{and assumed}} an alias. He went to New Orleans. From there, he {{traveled}} {{with a man}} named Thomas Early to San Antonio, Texas. When Early went missing during their travels, Desha fell under suspicion. A former Kentuckian living in Texas recognized Desha. Arrested soon after Early's body was found, Desha <b>confessed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> murder after being recognized by a second man from Kentucky. A day before his trial was to start, Desha died of a fever. A legend soon arose that he had faked his death and fled to Hawaii, where he married a native woman and fathered several children. Later historians have debunked that myth.|$|E
5|$|Sumaji {{withdrew his}} confession, then alleged that police had {{encouraged}} him to confess after plying him with alcohol and bribing him with money, a prostitute, and a better job if he <b>confessed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crime.

5|$|Hindman's assassins {{were never}} caught, and many {{theories}} regarding their identities have circulated throughout the years. In 1869, a white prisoner at the Phillips County jail told officials that he overheard two black inmates, Sip Cameron and Heyward Grant, discussing the crime. Grant supposedly <b>confessed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crime, saying the murder {{was part of}} a larger plot to seek revenge for the killing of Lee Morrison, a black person from Helena who had been hanged on September 27, 1868. Grant's claims did not fit with the facts of the murder, and his statements were dismissed from the investigation. No further leads ever developed, so the case was never reopened. Hindman was buried at Evergreen Cemetery (later named Maple Hill Cemetery) in Helena, near the grave of his friend Patrick Cleburne.|$|E
5|$|Lace <b>confessed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{murder on}} 17 September 1983.

He first knocked on the window and asked the time but then forced his way into the driver's seat beside her and locked the doors to prevent her escaping. Once inside he sexually assaulted her and strangled her using the passenger seatbelt in the car. He then took her handbag and jewellery, and hid for approximately 10minutes before heading to Southampton Central station and catching a train back to Portsmouth.|$|E
