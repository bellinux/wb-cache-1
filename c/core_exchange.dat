Also new is the ability to drop inbound e-mail before being fully processed, thus preventing delays in the message routing system. There are also improved message and mailbox management tools, which allow administrators to execute common chores more quickly. Others, such as Instant Messaging and Exchange Conferencing Server have been extracted completely in order to form separate products.

Reformulating the coalitional voting game by Serrano and Vohra [Information transmission in coalitional voting games, J. of Economic Theory (2007), 117 - 137] so that an informed agent proposes an allocation, we define a notion of the informational core. A coalition has an informational objection to the status-quo allocation if and only if there exists an equilibrium rejection in the coalitional voting game. We present a non-cooperative sequential bargaining game in which coalitional voting games are repeated, and prove that a refinement of a sequential equilibrium of the bargaining game necessarily yields an allocation in the informational core. <b>core,</b> <b>exchange</b> economy, incomplete information, information transmission, non-cooperative bargaining...|$|E

It seems economically reasonable that our knowledge and our possibility to make decisions depend on the coalition we belong to. We define a coalitional exchange economy by considering a pure exchange economy in which the individual consumption sets of consumers within a coalition depend on the membership of the coalition. Our definition includes as a particular case the classical definition of pure exchange economy. We adapt the core concept to a coalitional exchange economy, and we show the non-emptiness of the core. Finally, we discuss more general setting where individual preferences are also depending on the coalitions. Cooperative game, <b>core,</b> <b>exchange</b> economy, consumption possibility. ...|$|E

40|$|Hydrochemical and isotopic {{investigations}} of ground water at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, {{site of a}} potential permanent national nuclear-waste repository, demonstrate that younger rocks are dominated by calcium-sulfate or calcium-chloride water and that older rocks contain sodium-carbonate or sodium-bicarbonate water. Furthermore, unsaturated-zone pore water has significantly larger concentrations of major ions and dissolved solids than does the saturated-zone water. Recharge of perched or saturated-zone water, therefore, requires rapid flow through fractures or permeable regions in the unsaturated zone to avoid mixing with the chemically concentrated water in the unsaturated zone. This conceptual model is consistent with observations of rapidly moved post-bomb (post- 1954) tritium and chlorine- 36 in the deep unsaturated zone at Yucca Mountain. Presence of post-bomb tritium in matrix water away from fracture zones further indicates that parts of the fast-flow water that moves through fractures have been diverted laterally into nonwelded units. Experimental data show that different lithologic units require specific water-extraction methods for stable-isotope analyses of hydrogen and oxygen to ensure accurate characterization. Vacuum-distillation and compression-extraction methods both can yield accurate data but must be used with specific lithologies. Column experiments demonstrate that percolating water can exchange with pore water of the core as well as water held in zeolite minerals in the <b>core.</b> <b>Exchange</b> rates range from days to months.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we exploit a novel {{setting for}} Cognitive Radio (CR) {{networks}} to enable multiple operators to involve secondary users (SUs) as cooperative relays for their primary users. In return, SUs get {{an opportunity to}} access spare channels for their own data transmission. Initially, we assume that the CR network supports payment transfer. Then, we formulate the system as a transferable utility coalitional game. We show that there is an operating point that maximizes the sum utility over all operators and SUs while providing each player a share such that no subset of operators and SUs has an incentive to break away from the grand coalition. Such operating points exist when the solution set of the game, the core, is nonempty. Subsequently, we examine an interesting scenario where there is no payment mechanism in the network. This scenario can be investigated by using a nontransferable utility coalitional game model. We show that there exists a joint action to make the core nonempty. A general method with exponential computational complexity to get such a joint action is discussed. Then, we relate the core of this game to a competitive equilibrium of an exchange economy setting under special situations. As a result, several available efficient centralized or distributed algorithms in economics can be employed to compute a member in the core. In a nutshell, this paper constitutes the design of new coalition based dynamics {{that could be used in}} future CR networks.

Due to the presence of a chiral centre in the ligand <b>core,</b> <b>exchange</b> labelling of each of the MAG 3 derivatives results in the formation of two diastereomeric technetium complexes.

40|$|Although the {{prevalence}} and burden of chronic illness is immense and growing, national {{studies have found}} minimal use of evidence-based practices to improve the management and care provided for patients with these conditions. A productive body of work has identified facilitators and barriers {{to the use of}} care management processes (CMPs) in large physician practices using an organizational capabilities and external incentives framework. Physician groups enter into multiple affiliations in order to best position themselves to achieve economic success and to maintain professional autonomy. To date, little is known regarding the impact of these interorganizational networks on CMP use in physician groups and many experts have called for the incorporation of social network methods to explore this area. This study examines the relationships between network contagion and structural influences and CMP use among physician organizations in a managed care network. Specifically, the study addresses three main questions: 1) Do interorganizational ties influence the use of CMPs in physician organizations?; 2) Do external relationships influence how CMPs are used to treat patients with chronic conditions?; 3) Does change in network relationships influence change in CMP use in the practice setting? To address these questions, the study examined the managed care network in California during 2001 and 2006. Two unique datasets were merged to allow network analyses of the entire network of physician organizations, hospitals and hospital systems, and health maintenance organizations (HMOs) that participated in the network during this timeframe. An exchange perspective was employed to examine interorganizational relationships and network position based on the functions and exchange needs of the various actors in the market. Statistical and visual representations of the entire network were accomplished for both years. Cross-sectional statistical analysis was performed to test for the influence of network contagion and structural effects on CMP use in 347 physician organizations and in homogeneity of CMP use among almost 30, 000 pairs of physician groups in their treatment of four chronic conditions. Finally, a longitudinal analysis was performed to test for the effects of change in network affiliations on CMP homogeneity among almost 4, 000 cohort pairs. This is the first known study to employ this methodology in the study CMP use in physician organizations. &# 8195; Network analysis results highlight several important changes in exchange relation attributes among physician organizations in the California managed care network from 2001 to 2006. First, the overall size of the network {{in terms of the number}} of physician organizations participating in managed care declined considerably. Almost 25 percent of physician groups in 2001 had exited the network five years later. The majority of these organizations had closed due to financial hardships. The surviving physician organizations appear to be gaining network advantage in relationships with hospital systems and HMOs as these organizations have fewer structurally equivalent physician groups to meet their exchange needs. Empirical results supported the influence of contagion effects on CMP availability and use in the physician organization. A physician group's portfolio of direct interorganizational ties with hospitals and physician organizations was associated with greater odds of CMP use at the organizational level. Results of the cross-sectional pairwise analysis found strong support for the contagion influence of shared physician group ties and shared affiliations with hospital systems on homogeneity in CMP use for four chronic conditions (asthma, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and depression). Network structural effects were found to influence homogeneity in CMP use among physician organizations occupying similar locations within the network space. Physician groups sharing space within the core were found to be more homogeneous than groups occupying separate locations in the network. Conversely, CMP homogeneity declined over the five year period for among groups sharing space in the periphery. CMP use appears to be concentrated within the core of the managed care network and results of the cohort analysis failed to find evidence of diffusion toward the periphery. The findings suggest that peripheral physician organizations with few ties to <b>core</b> <b>exchange</b> partners may be at a structural disadvantage when it comes to obtaining the resources necessary to implement CMPs. This study found that jointly interdependent exchange relationships are influential in {{the prevalence}} of CMPs in physician practices and in how they are used for chronic illness care. Implications of these findings suggest that current discussions surrounding the development of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) should be expanded in order to establish more linkages between core and periphery organizations in the health care network...|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{investigation is}} reported into {{the influence of}} the counter cations on the optical, electrical and electroluminescent properties of polyelectrolytic conjugated polymers and of their cyclodextrin-threaded rotaxanes. We compare conjugated polyelectrolytes with sulfonated side groups where the anionic charge is balanced by Li+, K+, Cs +, tetramethylammonium (Me 4 N+) and cryptate-encapsulated potassium (K+ at [2. 2. 2]). Narrowing (for the unthreaded analogues) and a slight red-shift of the absorption spectra (for the rotaxanes) are found upon exchange of Li+ for larger cations, together with a blue-shift and an efficiency enhancement of the luminescence. These effects are similar in nature to those induced by rotaxination, and are therefore assigned to a marked reduction of intermolecular interactions between the conjugated <b>cores.</b> <b>Exchange</b> of Li+ for K+, Cs +, or Me 4 N+ results in a higher electroluminescence external quantum efficiency (EQE) for both polyrotaxanes and unthreaded polymers.
