40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} an ESP textbook {{in terms of}} McDonough and Shaw (2003) based on external and internal evaluation. The ESP textbook was Special English for <b>Computer</b> <b>Sciences</b> (2010) by Hojjat Baghban. This study also discussed the external evaluation and a detailed evaluation of a chapter of the ESP textbook. This ESP textbook was designed for teaching to students of <b>computer</b> <b>sciences</b> {{in the department of}} <b>computer</b> <b>sciences</b> inÂ  Islamic Azad University, Larestan Iran. This evaluation revealed that the ESP textbook would be appropriate with some modifications and also with some additional materials {{to meet the needs of}} the students of <b>computer</b> <b>sciences...</b>|$|R
5|$|Turing {{was highly}} {{influential}} {{in the development of}} theoretical <b>computer</b> <b>science,</b> providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer.

5|$|Brin {{attended}} {{elementary school}} at Paint Branch Montessori School in Adelphi, Maryland, but he received further education at home; his father, {{a professor in}} the department of mathematics at the University of Maryland, encouraged him to learn mathematics and his family helped him retain his Russian-language skills. He attended Eleanor Roosevelt High School in Greenbelt, Maryland. In September 1990 Brin enrolled in the University of Maryland, where he received his Bachelor of Science from the Department of <b>Computer</b> <b>Science</b> in 1993 with honors in <b>computer</b> <b>science</b> and mathematics, which is part of the University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences.|$|E
5|$|Brin {{immigrated to}} the United States with his family from the Soviet Union {{at the age of}} 6. He earned his bachelor's degree at the University of Maryland, {{following}} in his father's and grandfather's footsteps by studying mathematics, as well as <b>computer</b> <b>science.</b> After graduation, he enrolled in Stanford University to acquire a PhD in <b>computer</b> <b>science.</b> There he met Page, with whom he later became friends. They crammed their dormitory room with inexpensive computers and applied Brin's data mining system to build a web search engine. The program became popular at Stanford, and they suspended their PhD studies to start up Google in a rented garage.|$|E
