30|$|But {{the fact}} that the {{regional}} <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> does not possess monetary incitements (ownership) towards the PTA, is used by the PTA as an argument against involving the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> in all matters. For example in situations in which the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> agenda differs from that of the county council, the PTA excludes the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> from involvement and, approaching the county council and certain municipalities.|$|E
30|$|The {{regional}} <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> has a non-financial {{relationship with}} the PTA and is responsible for strategic regional traffic planning in the county.

30|$|The {{relationship}} between the county council and the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> seems to have changed due to the election in 2006. The PTA president stated that before the 2006 election, political dialogue between the PTA, regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body,</b> and county council was very productive. Before 2006, the political orientation of the majority was the same in both the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> and the county council; according to the PTA president, both the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> and county council chairs were good friends. After the 2006 election, the political majorities of the different organizations changed, and now the county council was governed by a Conservative block, whereas the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> had a Social Democratic chair. According to the PTA president, the dialogue between the county council and the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> had become “frosty”. Due to these frosty relations, the PTA president almost exclusively discussed policy issues with the county council as a single part [31]. In addition, civil servants working in the municipalities stated in interview that their main dialogue was with PTA directly, not via the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> (see, e.g., [32]).|$|E

30|$|This section {{deals with}} the {{regional}} organization, the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body.</b> The regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> has no budgetary influence over the PTA, so its financial resources are weak {{compared with those of}} the municipalities and the county council. Despite this, in the studied case, the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> managed to mobilize other resources to influence the planning process. The main strategies the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> used were the mobilization of informational resources and political mobilization by seeking cooperation with powerful individual actors. This section describes how resource exchange occurs horizontally, compared with the former case in which resource dependency occurred via hierarchal delegation chains.|$|E
30|$|Despite the quite modest {{influence}} the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> can exert on the municipalities, county council, and PTA, the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> civil servant managed to become {{very involved in}} the procurement planning process. This prompted different reactions from the PTA and the municipalities. I will use this example to illustrate how informational resource mobilization in combination with political resource mobilization may be effectively used by an actor, {{in this case the}} regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body,</b> that is subordinate to other principals.|$|E
30|$|At this time, the PTA {{presidium}} set up {{a meeting}} with the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> presidium. The aim of the meeting was to clarify the planned round of consultations and the procurement schedule, what role the consultant’s report should play in relation to the procurement document, and the report’s possible consequences [45]. The consultant’s report had directly affected the procurement process, resulting in an extra meeting between the PTA and the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> at which the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> had a chance to discuss the on-going schedule of the procurement process.|$|E

30|$|However, several {{also stated}} that the {{division}} between the county council and the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> had positive effects; for example, the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> had raised certain issues, such as environmental ones. The county council must prioritize between health care and traffic, and traffic often comes in second place (see, e.g., [35]).|$|E
30|$|It is thou {{important}} to point out that there is an exchange of resources between the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> and the county council, in terms of planning and financial responsibility of the regional traffic questions. As presented in the material, the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> and the county council had a good dialogue between each other during the time when the two organisations were governed by politicians with the same political colour (before the election in 2006). This may indicates two things. Firstly, in times when the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> and the county council’s political colour are the same, it is most likely that the resource exchange between the two organisations is larger, presumably the county council may also take in account power resources that the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> uses (for example monitoring the PTA by direct participation in the technical traffic group) to control and influence the PTA. Further studies are thou needed before it is possible to determine if so the case is. Secondly, the change of political colour in one organisation at the county level may also change the strategy used by the PTA. As the material show, before the election in 2006 the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> was to a greater extent included in dialogues that were taken place between the PTA and the county council.|$|E
30|$|Another {{strategy}} of PTAs attempts {{to keep the}} power over the process regards the actions the PTA takes towards the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body.</b> There examples where the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> are managing to mobilize political and informational resources that influence the game played by the PTA. Political resources were gathered on an individual, horizontal level by strategically selecting powerful people to form a steering committee.

30|$|In {{late fall}} 2006, during {{the round of}} consultation; the {{regional}} <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> tried to became more active in the procurement process. It did this using various strategies to mobilize informational resources. One strategy was to involve an independent consulting firm. This firm was asked to produce recommendations regarding the future development of public transport system in the county, and to present its analyses and suggestions in a report. This report was then to be printed {{on behalf of the}} regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> and sent to all municipalities and the county council. The consulting firm made four alternative suggestions regarding the new traffic routing system, but was also required to analyse the alternative that the PTA had proposed in the procurement document (this was a fifth alternative [43]). Thus, the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> had hired a consulting firm to evaluate the alternative that the PTA had designed.|$|E
30|$|The consultant’s {{report was}} {{published}} {{at the same}} time as the PTA conducted its round of consultations regarding the procurement content. The regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> sent the consultant’s report to the PTA, municipalities, and county council.|$|E
30|$|Another PTA {{strategy}} was to enrol municipal and regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> civil servants more directly. This meant that the PTA was mobilizing political resources via the civil servants, not directly from the politicians. For example, the PTA attempted to approach the civil servants by holding meetings with the “traffic technical group”. This group consists of civil servants from each municipality, the county council, the regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> and the PTA [35]. 3 In this group, the PTA informs the civil servants regarding current issues; some civil servants have a mandate to make decisions at the meeting, while others gather information and {{pass it on to}} their politicians before making any decisions [36].|$|E

30|$|The {{empirical}} data {{is based on}} a case study of a single procurement process in a Swedish county. The choice of case was strategic and based on several criteria. The first criterion was made according to achieve representation, i.e. it was important to chose an procurement that was made in a context that could be seen as representative for the institutional features of the Scandinavian model in Sweden. The procurement should therefore have to have occurred in a county where the public transport authority is 50 % county council owned and 50 % municipally owned. The county should also have a regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body.</b> This was important though joint ownership and an additional regional <b>cooperation</b> <b>body</b> is the most common organisational structure in this context in Sweden. Based on this first criteria, other criterion were then used to narrow down the selection, for example, due to the tendency criterion, it was important to choose an procurement that was recently conducted [24].|$|E

40|$|The {{diminutive}} size of many municipalities is {{an ancient}} and major problem for the Italian system of local government. In 2010 - 2012, {{under the pressure of}} the financial crisis, several laws have been passed to address this problem by forcing municipalities with 5000 inhabitants, or less, to establish cooperation networks. The essay focuses on the execution of the 2012 legislation, and on the further modifications which have been, or are being, approved by the Parliament: the normative framework apparently goes toward a stabilization, although it is still undergoing changes, and may be questioned in some points. The essay also surveys the principles which may be deducted from constitutional case law on the problematic relationships between statutorily prescribed cooperation and the constitutional guarantee of municipal autonomy: only municipalities may receive a direct democratic mandate by the citizens; inter-municipal <b>cooperation</b> <b>bodies</b> may be established, and also imposed on smaller municipalities, but the latter must have an effective role both in founding these bodies, and in deciding on their policies; at any rate, cooperation is not merely an economic or financial issue, and therefore should not belong to the State competence for financial coordination (as questionably ruled by the Constitutional Court in two recent judgments). Indeed, inter-municipal cooperation choices, as most decisions on administrative geography, have a distinct political character, and must be taken in accordance with the democratic and autonomist principles underlying the Italian Constitution...|$|R
