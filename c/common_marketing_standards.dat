40|$|Anglerfish are {{valuable}} commercial species for the Spanish otter-trawl fisheries operating in ICES Sub areas VI-VII and Divisions VIIIabd. Nevertheless, discard data {{of these species}} have never been used in stock assessment. Most of the specimens discarded are juveniles, and the motive argued by skippers, interviewed on board about the reasons for discarding anglerfish, are the small fish size and little market value (Project 98 / 095). The Council Regulation (2406 / 96) laying down <b>common</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>standards</b> for certain fishery products, set a minimum landing weight of 500 g for anglerfish. As this regulation was implemented in 2000, an increased anglerfish discard in trawl fleet should be expected since that year. Total estimates and causes of anglerfish discard are presented in this poster. Discard data were obtained by observers on board in different discard programs carried out by two Spanish Research Institutes, and are available for the periods 1988 - 1989, 1994, 1999 - 2000 and 2003 - 2006 (Table 1). Total discard (weight and number) and discard length distribution, were estimated by fishing unit. Preliminary total discard was estimated for both anglerfish by sampling trip...|$|E

Consequently, we argue that, the EU eastern enlargement has, by and large, been understood by citizens of new EU countries as primarily a process of economic adjustment to the <b>common</b> <b>market</b> <b>standards</b> with limited impact on political dimension of European integration, i. e. finalite politque of the EU institutional design or, more generally, the model of future democratic order in Europe. The main conclusion that could be drawn from the analysis of dynamics of collective identity formation {{in the context of the}} EU enlargement is that the inclusive paradigm of European democracy which constituted the identitarian foundation of European integration process since the establishment of first European Communities turned out to be self-defeating in the context of the EU eastern enlargement at least in short term perspective.

50|$|The {{primary reason}} {{at that time}} for the {{introduction}} of a common environmental policy was the concern that diverse environmental standards could result in trade barriers and competitive distortions in the <b>Common</b> <b>Market.</b> Different national <b>standards</b> for particular products, such as limitations on vehicle emissions for the lead content of petrol, posed significant barriers to the free trade of these products within the Economic Community (EC). An additional motivation driving the EU’s emerging environmental policy was the increasing international politicisation of environmental problems and the growing realisation {{from the beginning of the}} 1970s that environmental pollution did not stop at national borders, but had to be addressed by cross-border measures. At that time there was no mention of environmental policy in the founding treaties of the EU and therefore no explicit Treaty basis which underpinned EU environmental policy. However, the Treaty text was interpreted dynamically, enabling environmental policy to be regarded as an essential goal of the Community, even though it was not explicitly mentioned. It was not until the middle of the 1980s and the signing of the Single European Act in 1986 that economic and ecological objectives were put on a more equal footing within the Community.|$|R

Ex ante policies {{in each of the}} prospective members are the result of direct democracy, and equilibrium outcomes may include both import restrictions as well as subsidies. The decision to join a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> is modelled as a simultaneous move game between the two prospective members. Several interesting results emerge. First, ex ante differences in subsidies do not affect the attitude of the median voter. Second, for a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> to emerge, ex post factor flows between prospective members have to be balanced. Third, the likelihood that a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> emerges increases with the number of factors enjoying ex post enhanced protection.

40|$|We {{consider}} a setting of two firms and one capacity agent. Each firm serves a primary market, {{and the capacity}} agent sustains a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> to draw demand for capacity from the external firms. The firms can partner with the capacity agent under her contract to serve the <b>common</b> <b>market.</b> When they use the <b>common</b> <b>market</b> mainly as an outlet for their unused capacities, the capacity agent will only specify a variable fee for each capacity unit deployed through her, and prefer to partner with one firm in most circumstances. When the firms adjust capacities to accommodate the businesses created by serving the <b>common</b> <b>market,</b> the capacity agent will specify a lump-sum payment and a variable fee, and {{will be more likely}} to incentivize only one firm to partner with her, when the <b>common</b> <b>market</b> is sufficiently large or the demands in the <b>common</b> and primary <b>markets</b> are strongly correlated. She will always use a fixed fee to extract, while not necessarily all, the profit gains to the firms serving the <b>common</b> <b>market,</b> but will use a variable fee only when partnering with both firms.

40|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} that a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> between two or more countries improves overall well-being, but it creates winners and losers in each country. Recent empirical findings also show that the overall impact of a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> on per capita income depends on the similarity of economic development between member countries. A <b>common</b> <b>market</b> among developed countries results in the convergence of per capita income while a <b>common</b> <b>market</b> among developing countries results in the divergence of per capita income. The difference in outcome, some economists suggest, is due to variations in comparative advantage between member states {{and the rest of}} the world. But the theory of comparative advantage does not fully explain the results of the de facto <b>common</b> <b>market</b> between Ethiopia and Eritrea (1991 - 1998). The empirical findings of this study demonstrate that the Ethio-Eritrea preferential trade arrangement benefited Eritrea and harmed Ethiopia. The main reason for these asymmetric consequences was acceptance by the Ethiopian government of the unfavourable terms of the preferential trade arrangement between the two countries...|$|R
