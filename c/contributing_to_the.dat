5|$|Although the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are {{generally}} considered {{the starting point}} of the modern gay liberation movement, a number of demonstrations and actions took place before that date.

The early actions have been credited with preparing the gay community for Stonewall and <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> riots' symbolic power.|$|E
