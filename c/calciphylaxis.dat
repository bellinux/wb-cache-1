5000|$|The {{cause of}} <b>calciphylaxis</b> is unknown. It {{does not seem}} to be an immune type reaction. In other words, <b>calciphylaxis</b> is not a {{hypersensitivity}} reaction (i.e., allergic reaction) leading to sudden local calcification. Clearly, additional factors are involved in <b>calciphylaxis.</b> It is also known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy; however, the disease is not limited to patients with kidney failure. The current belief is that in end-stage kidney disease, abnormal calcium and phosphate homeostasis result in the deposition of calcium in the vessels, also known as metastatic calcification. Once the calcium has been deposited, a thrombotic event occurs within the lumen of these vessels, resulting in tissue infarction. It is unknown what the triggers are that cause the thrombotic and ischemic event. [...] Reported risk factors include female sex, obesity, elevated calcium*phosphate product, medications such as warfarin, vitamin D derivatives e.g. calcitriol, calcium-based binders, or systemic steroids, protein C or S deficiency, low blood albumin levels, and diabetes mellitus.|$|E

50|$|The first skin {{changes in}} <b>calciphylaxis</b> lesions are {{mottling}} {{of the skin}} and induration in a livedo reticularis pattern. As tissue thrombosis and infarction occurs, a black, leathery eschar in an ulcer with adherent black slough are found. Surrounding the ulcers is usually a plate-like area of indurated skin. These lesions are always extremely painful and most often occur on the lower extremities, abdomen, buttocks, and penis. Because the tissue has infarcted, wound healing seldom occurs, and ulcers {{are more likely to}} become secondarily infected. Many cases of <b>calciphylaxis</b> end with systemic bacterial infection and death.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{who receive}} kidney transplants also receive immunosuppression.

50|$|Vitamin D- Normally, {{the kidney}} changes vitamin D into its active form, vitamin D3, which helps you absorb calcium. Many {{dialysis}} patients have low intakes of calcium due to avoidance of foods containing phosphorus and potassium. Lack of calcium {{can lead to}} renal osteodystrophy (bone weakening). On the other hand, too much calcium can cause calcification or <b>calciphylaxis</b> (calcium deposits {{in places such as}} the heart.

5000|$|There is no {{diagnostic}} test for <b>calciphylaxis.</b> The diagnosis is a clinical one. The characteristic lesions are the ischemic skin lesions (usually with areas of skin necrosis). The necrotic skin lesions (i.e. the dying or already dead skin areas) typically appear as violaceous (dark bluish purple) lesions and/or completely black leathery lesions. They can be extensive. The suspected diagnosis can {{be supported by}} a skin biopsy. It shows arterial calcification and occlusion {{in the absence of}} vasculitis.

5000|$|Typically, {{coronary}} artery disease occurs when part of the smooth, elastic lining inside a {{coronary artery}} (the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle) develops atherosclerosis. With atherosclerosis, the artery's lining becomes hardened, stiffened, and swollen with calcium deposits, fatty deposits, and abnormal inflammatory cells - to form a plaque. Deposits of calcium phosphates (hydroxyapatites) in the muscular layer of the blood vessels appear to play not only {{a significant role in}} stiffening arteries but also for the induction of an early phase of coronary arteriosclerosis. This can be seen in a so-called metastatic mechanism of <b>calciphylaxis</b> as it occurs in chronic kidney disease and haemodialysis (Rainer Liedtke 2008). Although these patients suffer from a kidney dysfunction, almost fifty percent of them die due to {{coronary artery disease}}. Plaques {{can be thought of as}} large [...] "pimples" [...] that protrude into the channel of an artery, causing a partial obstruction to blood flow. Patients with coronary artery disease might have just one or two plaques, or might have dozens distributed throughout their coronary arteries. A more severe form is chronic total occlusion (CTO) when a coronary artery is completely obstructed for more than 3 months.|$|E

BackgroundWe conducted a {{case control study}} to determine risk factors and mortality associated with <b>calciphylaxis</b> in end-stage renal disease. MethodsCases of <b>calciphylaxis</b> diagnosed between December 1989 and January 2000 were identified. Three controls were identified for each hemodialysis patient, with <b>calciphylaxis</b> matched to the date of initiation of hemodialysis. Laboratory data and medication doses were recorded during the 12 {{months prior to the}} date of diagnosis and at the time of diagnosis of <b>calciphylaxis.</b> Conditional logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for <b>calciphylaxis.</b> Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the risk of death associated with <b>calciphylaxis.</b> ResultsNineteen cases and 54 controls were identified. Eighteen patients were hemodialysis patients, and one had a functioning renal allograft. Diagnosis was confirmed by skin biopsy in 16 cases. Women were at a sixfold higher risk of developing <b>calciphylaxis</b> (OR = 6. 04, 95 % CI 1. 62 to 22. 6, P = 0. 007). There was a 21 % lower risk of <b>calciphylaxis</b> associated with each 0. 1 g/dL increase in the mean serum albumin during the year prior to diagnosis and at the time of diagnosis of <b>calciphylaxis</b> (OR = 0. 79, 95 % CI, 0. 64 to 0. 99, P = 0. 037, and OR = 0. 80, 95 % CI, 0. 67 to 0. 96, P = 0. 019, respectively). There was a 3. 51 -fold increase in the risk of <b>calciphylaxis</b> associated with each mg/dL increase in the mean serum phosphate during the year prior to diagnosis (95 % CI, 0. 99 to 12. 5, P = 0. 052). At the time of diagnosis of <b>calciphylaxis,</b> for each 10 IU/L increment in alkaline phosphatase, the risk of <b>calciphylaxis</b> increased by 19 % (OR = 1. 19, 95 % CI, 1. 00 to 1. 40, P = 0. 045).

Most {{research in the field}} of <b>calciphylaxis</b> is focused on hemodialysis (HD) patients; however, data on <b>calciphylaxis</b> incidence, risk factors, and mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients are limited. Methods: In this cohort study, we examined data from adult patients who initiated PD for ESRD management at our institute’s PD unit from January 2001 to December 2015. Associations with the development of <b>calciphylaxis</b> were examined for clinical, laboratory, and medication exposures. Incidence of <b>calciphylaxis</b> and mortality in PD patients who developed <b>calciphylaxis</b> were analyzed. Treatments administered to treat <b>calciphylaxis</b> in PD patients were summarized. Results: In this cohort of 63 patients, 7 patients developed <b>calciphylaxis</b> (incidence rate: 9. 0  per 1, 000 patient-years). Median age of PD patients who developed <b>calciphylaxis</b> was 50 years, 57 % were white, 71 % females, and 71 % were previously on HD. Female sex, obesity, HD as a prior dialysis modality, recurrent hypotension, elevated time-averaged serum phosphorous levels, reduced time-averaged serum albumin levels, and warfarin therapy were associated with increased <b>calciphylaxis</b> risk in univariate logistic regression analyses. Intravenous sodium thiosulfate was administered in 57 % of PD patients who developed <b>calciphylaxis.</b> One-year mortality in PD patients who developed <b>calciphylaxis</b> was 71 % despite multimodal treatment including sodium thiosulfate, hyperbaric oxygen, cinacalcet, and wound debridement.

Our study provides critical early insights into <b>calciphylaxis</b> incidence, risk factors, and prognosis in PD patients.
