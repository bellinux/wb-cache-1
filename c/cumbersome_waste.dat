40|$|This {{experimental}} work investigates {{the impact of}} substituting part of the conventional aggregates with rubber aggre-gates on certain characteristics of the cement concretes. This incorporation of rubber aggregates resulting from cutting worn tires in practical sizes decreases the mechanical resistances of the concretes while improving slightly the fluidity of the tested mixtures. The effect of these aggregates on the shrinkage of the concretes {{at an early age}} is appreciable and even very interesting for the concretes used, for example, in road construction. This technique of cutting worn tires without any further treatment makes it accessible to everyone which helps not only in saving the environment by getting rid of this <b>cumbersome</b> <b>waste</b> but also in saving traditional aggregates...|$|E
40|$|Ashes from {{municipal}} solid waste incineration (MSWI) may be a <b>cumbersome</b> <b>waste</b> to handle. Some ash fractions contain organic pollutants, such as dioxins, as well as heavy metals. Additionally, some of the metals have a high value and are considered as critical to the industry. Recovery of e. g. copper and zinc from MSWI ashes will not only recover valuable metals that would otherwise be land filled, but also reduce the toxicity of the ash and thereby make it less cumbersome to handle. Such processes are presently being investigated by the Industrial Materials Recycling group at Chalmers University of Technology. The processes are primarily based on acid leaching of the ash combined with selective solvent extraction. The work on recovery process development is supported by investigations of the chemical speciation of metals, i. e. identification of metal compounds, in ashes by, e. g. synchrotron based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The presentation will give an introduction to the validation of an optimized leaching process for MSWI and speciation results for Cu and Zn, as well as discuss the promising results that have been obtained using the suggested recovery processes for these metals...|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of valorization of the worn tires and environment preservation, several techniques exist in many fields. In Algeria, and since 2005, about 19 facilities are carried out using the so-called `Pneusol ' technique. Currently, researches {{are interested in the}} use of rubber fine powder (RFP) that results from worn tires crushing. The letters constitute a <b>cumbersome</b> <b>waste.</b> [1, 2] The present work presents, beginning from an experimental investigation, the possible using of tire scrap in road coating. The main purpose of such mixture is to improve certain mechanical properties, and also to reduce waste materials in the urban or agricultural zones leading to environmental and human damage. The mean study approach refers to the behavior of asphaltic concrete containing fine powders. The latter is produced by crushing of rubbery products and worn-out tires through dry and wet processes. Changes in rheological laws and in mechanical properties of the bituminous powder mixture are checked by means of experiments. The present study highlights the influence of fine powder content, size distribution and mixing conditions on some product properties such as deformation modulus, compactness and creep. The experimental results of the whole survey lead to interesting correlations. In addition, the rubber fine powder (RFP) is recognized taking into account road and environment interests. This appears to be, economically, interesting. 1...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of welfare state {{policies}} in the 20 th century, public institutions grew, diversified, and the field of public administration expanded considerably {{in terms of public}} services. This has brought about <b>cumbersome,</b> resource <b>waste,</b> paperwork and similar problems in public administration. But especially after the economic crisis of the 1970 s, the debate about public administration's fundamental change and transformation has been intensified. These debates, which also constitute the foundations of the New Public Management, led to a re-questioning of the public administration and a radical transformation. Changing systems have foreseen a state that provides faster and more efficient services and the state has to adopt a structural transformation that limits its activities to provide efficient services instead of operating in every field. In this transformation process, it is being argued that the private sector and the public sector are not different from each other and that the techniques successfully applied in the private sector can also be implemented by the public administration. In this context, the most important tool that comes out to provide effective and efficient service in public administration is performance concept and performance management process. But management tradition and culture have a great influence in the implementation and success of this technique. AngloSaxon state tradition, which attaches importance to organizational understanding and practice, is more inclined to adapt modern management techniques to public administration; Continental Europe state tradition seems to be more distant from these techniques by giving more importance to theory and public institutions...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{municipal}} solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash has increased {{in many parts of the}} world in recent years. Ashes from {{municipal solid waste}} incineration (MSWI) may be a <b>cumbersome</b> <b>waste</b> to handle since containing significant amounts of leachable hazardous metal species and must be landfilled in special sites at high costs. Recovery of e. g. copper, zinc and lead from MSWI ashes may not only recover valuable metals that would otherwise be land filled, but also reduce the toxicity of the ash and thereby make it possible to use a less expensive landfill option or perhaps even to utilize the ash residue as a construction material. The work presented here discusses the development and evaluation of a metal recycling process for MSWI fly ash based on acid leaching and solvent extraction; fly ash and bottom ash from an MSWI facility was used for studying and optimization of metal leaching using different solutions (nitric acid, hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid) and parameters (temperature, controlled pH value, leaching time, and liquid/solid ratio). It was shown that hydrochloric acid is relatively efficient in solubilizing copper (75. 3 ± 3. 0 %), zinc (80. 8 ± 5. 3 %) from the fly ash in less than 24 hours at 20 °C. Efficient leaching of cadmium and lead (over 92 % and 90 % respectively) was also achieved. After leaching, a selective solvent extraction to recover Cu using an oxime (LIX 860 -I) followed by a Zn extraction with phosphine oxides (Cyanex 923) were carried out sequentially. Both extraction reagents gave good yields and stripping of Cu and Zn is also possible in a single step using sulfuric acid or nitric acid respectively. The extraction of Cu was selective but a significant amount of other metals, such as Fe, were co-extracted together with Zn. It was shown that it is possible to decrease the contamination of Fe by adjusting the extraction parameters (e. g. adjusting the concentration of nitric acid solution for stripping) or by cleaning the final solution by cementation. A metal recycling process for MSWI fly ash is suggested based on the results from this study...|$|E
