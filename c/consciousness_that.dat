5|$|Icke {{combines}} New Age philosophical {{discussion about}} the universe and consciousness with conspiracy theories about public figures being reptilian humanoids and paedophiles. He argues in favour of reincarnation; a collective <b>consciousness</b> <b>that</b> has intentionality; modal realism (that other possible worlds exist alongside ours); and the law of attraction (that good and bad thoughts can attract experiences).|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{prosperity}} and modernization PedroII {{left to the}} nation, {{there was also a}} heritage of political and personal values. Many of his reforms and achievements had become {{so much a part of}} the national <b>consciousness</b> <b>that</b> they were accommodated by successor regimes. These formed the foundation for Brazilian democratic ideals. Historians have also largely agreed that PedroII's reign was not merely benign, but rather, exceptionally constructive and progressive. He has also consistently been ranked by scholars as the greatest Brazilian.|$|E
5|$|The social {{rigidity}} of the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s encountered a backlash as social movements {{to improve the}} standing of African Americans, the poor, women, and gays all became prominent. Of the latter two, the gay rights movement and the feminist movement connected after a violent confrontation occurred in New York City in the 1969 Stonewall riots. What followed was a movement characterized by a surge of gay activism and feminist <b>consciousness</b> <b>that</b> further transformed the definition of lesbian.|$|E

5|$|Kirk takes {{command of}} the ship citing his experience, angering Captain Willard Decker, who had been {{overseeing}} the refit as its new commanding officer. Testing of Enterprises new systems goes poorly; two officers, including the Vulcan Enterprise science officer Sonak, are killed by a malfunctioning transporter, and improperly calibrated engines almost destroy the ship. Kirk's unfamiliarity with the new systems of the Enterprise increases the tension between him and first officer Decker. Commander Spock arrives as a replacement science officer, explaining that while on his home world undergoing a ritual to purge all emotion, he felt a <b>consciousness</b> <b>that</b> he believes emanates from the cloud.|$|E
5|$|The head {{is celebrated}} as {{a mark of}} {{identity}} as well as source of the seed. Thus, the self-decapitation represents removal of maya (illusion or delusion), physical attachment, false notions, ignorance, and egoism. The scimitar also signifies severance of these obstacles to moksha (emancipation), jnana (wisdom), and self-realization. The goddess also denotes discriminating perception. Chhinnamasta allows the devotee to gain a <b>consciousness</b> <b>that</b> transcends the bonds of physical attachment, the body, and the mind by her self-sacrifice. One interpretation suggests that her three eyes represent the sun, the moon, and fire while another links the third eye to transcendental knowledge. Unlike other Hindu deities who are depicted facing the devotee, Chhinnamasta generally looks at herself, prompting the devotee to look within him- or herself.|$|E
25|$|The Mahāsāṃghika coupled {{this idea}} of the {{luminous}} mind {{with the idea of}} the mulavijnana, the substratum <b>consciousness</b> <b>that</b> serves as the basis consciousness.|$|E

50|$|Higher-order {{theories}} of <b>consciousness</b> postulate <b>that</b> <b>consciousness</b> consists in perceptions or thoughts about first-order mental states. In particular, phenomenal consciousness {{is thought to}} be higher-order representation of perceptual or quasi-perceptual contents, such as visual images.|$|R

25|$|The Institute for Circlework organizes {{workshops}} in Israel that unite Jewish and Arab women, {{with a particular}} focus on women leaders.

25|$|Vallée {{proposes that}} there is a genuine UFO phenomenon, partly {{associated}} with a form of non-human <b>consciousness</b> <b>that</b> manipulates space and time. The phenomenon has been active throughout human history, and seems to masquerade in various forms to different cultures. In his opinion, the intelligence behind the phenomenon attempts social manipulation by using deception on the humans with whom they interact.|$|E
25|$|Eugene Linden, {{author of}} The Parrot's Lament {{suggests}} {{there are many}} examples of animal behavior and intelligence that surpass what people would suppose to be the boundary of animal consciousness. Linden contends that {{in many of these}} documented examples, a variety of animal species exhibits behavior that can only be attributed to emotion, and to a level of <b>consciousness</b> <b>that</b> we would normally ascribe only to our own species.|$|E
5000|$|Overall, Rohmer {{stated that}} he wanted the [...] "Six Moral Tales" [...] "to portray in film what seemed most alien to the medium, to express {{feelings}} buried deep in our <b>consciousness.</b> <b>That's</b> why {{they have to be}} narrated in the first person singular...The protagonist discusses himself and judges his actions.

25|$|Tulving has seminally defined {{three key}} {{properties}} of episodic memory recollection. These are a subjective {{sense of time}} (or mental time travel), connection to the self, and autonoetic consciousness. Autonoetic consciousness refers to {{a special kind of}} <b>consciousness</b> <b>that</b> accompanies the act of remembering which enables an individual {{to be aware of the}} self in a subjective time. Aside from Tulving, others named the important aspects of recollection which includes visual imagery, narrative structure, retrieval of semantic information and the feelings of familiarity.|$|E
25|$|Children {{living in}} mixed {{immigration}} status households live with fear of deportation threats of parents or themselves. They often feel scared, sad {{and worried about}} possible separation. This can be traumatic and have negative effects on the children’s well-being. As a result, children may interpret their reality as depriving and cruel. They may process their experiences with a <b>consciousness</b> <b>that</b> mirrors that of their undocumented parents, even though many are U.S. born citizens {{with all of the}} benefits rights, and privileges that U.S. citizenship carries.|$|E
25|$|Consciousness is {{described}} as a state of being, very closely related to God. The consciousness within the normal person is said to be 97% asleep. Consciousness asleep is <b>consciousness</b> <b>that</b> is subconscious, unconscious, or infraconscious, which are various levels of psychological sleep. Psychological sleep is a way to describe the lack of self-awareness, meaning that the common and ordinary person is not aware of 97% of what constitutes the ordinary state of being. A consciousness asleep is caused by what Aun Weor calls identification, fascination, or the incorrect transformation of impressions, which all imply a type of <b>consciousness</b> <b>that</b> is not aware of its own processes. It is said that to awaken consciousness one must understand that his or her consciousness is asleep. This implies that one must begin to understand every impulse, action, thought and movement one makes, a feat that is said to be accomplished through the mental discipline of meditation and self-observation. Furthermore, it is stated that the awakening of consciousness {{is the only way to}} acquiring gnosis and achieve a true and radical change by removing the spurious psychological aggregates that cause unnecessary suffering. The awakening of consciousness goes hand in hand with the transmutation of sexual energy because the higher states of consciousness depend upon the energy of sexual transmutation.|$|E

5000|$|Theorists {{differ in}} how they relate {{consciousness}} to electromagnetism. Electromagnetic field theories (or [...] "EM field theories") of <b>consciousness</b> propose <b>that</b> <b>consciousness</b> results when a brain produces an electromagnetic field with specific characteristics. Susan Pockett and Johnjoe McFadden have proposed EM field theories; William Uttal has criticized McFadden's and other field theories.|$|R
25|$|Hinduism has no {{traditional}} ecclesiastical order, no centralized religious authorities, no governing body, no prophet(s) nor any binding holy book; Hindus {{can choose}} to be polytheistic, pantheistic, monistic, or atheistic. Within this diffuse and open structure, spirituality in Hindu philosophy is an individual experience, and referred to as ksaitrajña (Sanskrit: क्षैत्रज्ञ). It defines spiritual practice as one's journey towards moksha, awareness of self, the discovery of higher truths, true nature of reality, and a <b>consciousness</b> <b>that</b> is liberated and content.|$|E
25|$|When {{preliminary}} nibbana with substrate occurs (that is, nibbana of {{a living}} being), constructive <b>consciousness,</b> <b>that</b> is, the house-builder, is completely destroyed and no new formations will be constructed. However, sankharas {{in the sense of}} constructed consciousness, which exists as a 'karmically-resultant-consciousness' (vipāka viññāna), continue to exist. Each liberated individual produces no new karma, but preserves a particular individual personality which {{is the result of the}} traces of his or her karmic heritage. The very fact that there is a psycho-physical substrate during the remainder of an arahant's lifetime shows the continuing effect of karma.|$|E
25|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of Chaitanya's 16th century bhakti movement in Bengal, Haridasa Thakur and other born Muslims {{as well as those of}} various faiths joined together to spread love of God. This openness received a boost from Bhaktivinoda Thakura's broad-minded vision in the late 19th century and was institutionalized by Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati in his Gaudiya Matha in the 20th century. A disciple of Bhaktisiddhanta, Srila A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, is the founder of the International Society for Krishna <b>Consciousness,</b> <b>that</b> celebrates festivals memory of Haridasa Thakura in India and worldwide.|$|E

25|$|In that spirit, Nearing {{moved through}} a series of secessions—from Christianity, from politics, and finally from American society itself. He voyaged to the {{wilderness}} as if on a pilgrimage to a sacred place. His experience, along with a deeper understanding of American culture, led to the inescapable <b>consciousness</b> <b>that</b> capitalist cultural dominance was too strong to eliminate and therefore too powerful to control or mold to liberal purposes. The secessions in his life were progressive repudiations of American canons of moral conduct as well as indications of Nearing's perception of the fragmented, segmented, discontinuous nature of American society. Only in the isolated private sphere provided by homesteading could a radical resistance and constructive challenge to capitalist culture be nurtured.|$|E
25|$|Objectivism's central tenets {{are that}} reality exists {{independently}} of <b>consciousness,</b> <b>that</b> {{human beings have}} direct contact with reality through sense perception, that one can attain objective knowledge from perception {{through the process of}} concept formation and inductive logic, that the proper moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness (rational self-interest), that the only social system consistent with this morality is one that displays full respect for individual rights embodied in laissez-faire capitalism, and that the role of art in human life is to transform humans' metaphysical ideas by selective reproduction of reality into a physical form—a work of art—that one can comprehend and to which one can respond emotionally.|$|E
25|$|Stax {{was located}} in Memphis, Tennessee, which was still a {{segregated}} city, where Martin Luther King, Jr., {{a leader of the}} civil rights movement, was assassinated in 1968. Whilst there was much racism around the artists, the Stax recording studio seemed to be an escape from the turmoil of the real world. When the artists got into the studio, they were there for one reason only, and that was to make hit music, some of which had the social <b>consciousness</b> <b>that</b> became a soundtrack for the civil rights movement. On their 1967 tour in Europe, some of the Stax artists were taken aback by the welcome that they received, enjoying a better reception in parts of Europe than in the United States.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{will present}} a new {{argument}} based on revised quantum dynamics (Ghiradi et al, 1986; Pearle, 1989; Diosi, 1989; Ghiradi et al, 1990; Penrose, 1996; Gao, 1999 a, 1999 b; Gao, 2000), which is generally taken as the promising complete version of present quantum theory (Penrose, 1989; 1994), and {{has been used to}} construct a consciousness theory (Hameroff et al, 1996 a; 1996 b). It is shown <b>that</b> <b>consciousness</b> may help to distinguish the nonorthogonal single states in the framework of revised quantum dynamics, while the usual physical measuring device can't (Gao, 1999 c; Gao, 2000). We further analyze the possible inferences of this unusual conclusion, and demonstrate that it strongly implies that the physical world is not causally closed without <b>consciousness.</b> The fact <b>that</b> <b>consciousness</b> violates the basic physical principle also reveals <b>that</b> <b>consciousness</b> is a fundamental property of matter, and a complete theory of matter must involve <b>consciousness.</b> We conclude <b>that</b> the above argument provides a possible quantum basis for panpsychism...|$|R
