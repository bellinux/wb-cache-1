2500|$|The first {{continuous}} use of chlorine in the United States for disinfection {{took place in}} 1908 at Boonton Reservoir (on the Rockaway River), which served as the supply for Jersey City, New Jersey. [...] Chlorination was achieved by controlled additions of dilute solutions of chloride of lime (calcium hypochlorite) at doses of 0.2 to 0.35 ppm. [...] The treatment process was conceived by Dr. John L. Leal and the <b>chlorination</b> <b>plant</b> was designed by George Warren Fuller. [...] Over the next few years, chlorine disinfection using chloride of lime were rapidly installed in drinking water systems around the world.|$|E
50|$|In 1884 the Frampton United Company {{was formed}} {{in an attempt to}} {{establish}} a <b>chlorination</b> <b>plant</b> but the following year Wattle Creek on which the crushing operations depended dried up and crushing operations were halted. In 1886 five reverberatory furnaces were set up at the Frampton United Company lease, to be operated in conjunction with a <b>chlorination</b> <b>plant</b> for gold retrieval. Frampton United Company then erected a barrel <b>chlorination</b> <b>plant</b> and with the 5 reverberatory furnaces achieved a throughput capacity of 60 tons per week at a cost of £3,000.|$|E
5000|$|On June 19, 1908, Leal hired George W. Fuller to {{construct}} a <b>chlorination</b> <b>plant</b> at Boonton Reservoir to disinfect the water for Jersey City as a representation of [...] "other plans or devices". At the time, Fuller was, perhaps, the most respected sanitary engineer in the U.S.. In 99 days, Fuller designed the <b>chlorination</b> <b>plant</b> and supervised its construction. Dilute solutions of chloride of lime were accurately fed by gravity to the water being treated. Fuller based his design on the successful aluminum sulfate feed system that he had built at the Little Falls Water Treatment Plant in 1902. The <b>chlorination</b> <b>plant</b> at Boonton Reservoir treating an average of 40 million gallons per day went on-line on September 26, 1908. Since then, water from this source has been continuously chlorinated, making it the water supply with the longest history of disinfection.|$|E

50|$|The mined ore was roasted, or {{converted}} into an oxide, in a kiln, {{and then run}} through a chlorination process {{before it could be}} extracted. From 1882 to 1889, Garden City had several <b>chlorination</b> <b>plants</b> and formed the Garden City Chlorination Works, causing a brief period of boom. Later, the ore was treated using the cyanide process. The ore produced from the mines and mill sold for $30 per ton. However, the gold ore was not pure; it also contained trace amounts of copper, arsenic, silver, bismuth, and antimony. In 1890, a forest fire threatened Garden City, and the mine's explosives were briefly evacuated.|$|R
40|$|Residues from rutile <b>chlorination</b> <b>plants</b> often contain {{relatively}} {{high concentrations of}} critical metals, essential for energy devices. Ironically, the conventional method of extraction of niobium and zirconium is quite energy demanding and detrimental to the environment. In this investigation, the kinetics of dissolution of niobium and zirconium from titania waste in hydrochloric acid solutions are investigated. The thermodynamic stability of minerals demands the use of chlorination, carbothermic reduction or alkaline fusion for breakdown of their mineral concentrate and upgrading before leaching in acid, usually hydrofluoric acid. Reclamation of niobium and zirconium values from titania waste presents {{an opportunity for a}} low energy process to be utilised. The effects of parameters leaching temperature (25 - 90 oC), acid concentration (0. 5 - 2. 5 M), stirring speed and solid-to-liquid ratio were determined in the experiments. Leachates were analysed by ICP OES, using which the models for the leaching processes and activation energies were determined...|$|R

50|$|Problems {{continued}} with dioxin emission from the works incinerator which burned residues from the <b>chlorination</b> <b>plant.</b> This caused further public protest and instigated official investigations {{that culminated in}} prosecution and a fine of £150,000 for contamination of the river Doe Lea and surrounding farmland in 1996.

40|$|A brief {{review of}} the effects of {{halogenated}} organic compounds on the fluvial ecosystem is folloed by results from a detailed monitoring of these substances in all the Marches region rivers. The results show generally modest concentrations, except for sporadic peaks for chloroform. Sites revealing significant concentrations of halogenated organic compounds also manifested a worsening of the waters with lessening of E. B. I. Attention is drawn to the negative effects of indiscriminate <b>chlorination</b> of purification <b>plant</b> outputs, as this practice often fails to resolve infective problems and in itself adds toxicity to the watercourses...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{toxicity}} of chloroform to four species {{of freshwater fish}} was studied in flow-through 96 -hr toxicity tests. Chloroform is toxic to fish {{in the tens of}} parts per million, a concentration well above that which would be expected to be produced under normal power <b>plant</b> <b>chlorination</b> conditions. Investigations of acute {{toxicity of}} chloroform and the bioaccumulation of chlorinated compounds in tissues of fish revealed differences in tolerance levels and tissue accumulations. Mean 96 -hr LC{sub 50 }s for chloroform were 18 ppm for rainbow trout and bluegill, 51 ppm for largemouth bass and 75 ppm for channel catfish. Mortalities of bluegill and largemouth bass occurred during the first 4 hr of exposure while rainbow trout and channel catfish showed initial tolerance and mortalities occurred during {{the latter half of the}} 96 -hr exposure. Rainbow trout had the highest level of chloroform tissue accumulation, 7 {micro}g/g tissue, catfish the second highest, 4 {micro}g/g tissue, followed by bluegill and largemouth bass which each accumulated about 3 {micro}g/g tissue. Accumulation of chloroform was less than one order of magnitude above water concentrations for all species...|$|R
40|$|<b>Chlorination</b> {{of power}} <b>plant</b> cooling water is {{extensively}} {{used as a}} means of controlling biofouling. This practice presents the potential for formation of halogenated organic compounds hazardous to man and his environment. Accordingly, the organic composition resulting from the chlorination of natural waters (northern Olympic Penn 1 sula sea water and the Columbia River in Washington State} has been investigated. Nonpolar lipophilic organic halogens were extracted by passing large volumes of water over columns of XAD- 2 macroreticular resins. Examination of ether extracts from the resin columns using capillary gas chromatography revealed the presence of halogenated methanes, as well as other electron-capturing components~ that were not found when unchlorinated water was sampled. Examination of the chlorinated water extracts using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed complex mixtures which generally were not separable into individual components~ even when high efficiency WCOT capillary columns were used. The samples were separated into fractions of increasing polarity using a water-deactivated silica gel column. Fractions were thus obtained which were more amenable to GC/MS investigation. Haloforms were identified as the major halogenated product from chlorination of the waters studied. Other halogenated products were found at much lower concentrations...|$|R
5000|$|In 1888 a 10-head stamper and a [...] "dry crusher" [...] were {{installed}} but these proved a failure. In 1889 the Advance Company went down 400 ft and erected roasting and <b>chlorination</b> <b>plant</b> but following an unsuccessful attempt to treat 70 tons of ore this plant was abandoned in 1890. The continued failure was {{probably due to}} a high amount of calcite in the ore.|$|E
50|$|Operated by the Metropolitan Utilities District, the Water Works {{operates}} the intakes and pumps that draw {{water from the}} Missouri River for the city. It {{is the site of}} a <b>chlorination</b> <b>plant,</b> sedimentation and storage basins, and a filter plant that has a daily capacity of 72 million gallons.

His later writings gave no credit to Leal and, by inference, Johnson took the credit for the decision to use chlorine on the Jersey City water supply.

40|$|Before {{reclaimed}} {{water is}} used more widely within the current United States (U. S.) wastewater treatment infrastructure, {{it is important}} to examine the potential public health impacts of this emerging, alternative freshwater resource. My dissertation evaluated antibiotic concentrations and the composition of bacterial communities in conventionally treated municipal wastewater and resulting reclaimed water. I also evaluated the efficacy of a point-of-use filtration system in reducing antimicrobials present in reclaimed water. My objectives were to: 1) Assess the fate of antibiotics and; 2) Characterize the total bacterial community structure of differentially treated wastewater, and reclaimed water that has undergone on-site treatment and storage; and 3) Evaluate zero-valent iron (ZVI) -biosand filtration as a potential point-of use treatment technology for the reduction of antimicrobials from conventionally treated reclaimed water. I extracted nine antibiotics and total genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from differentially treated wastewater and reclaimed water samples from two Mid-Atlantic and two Midwest WWTPs, and one associated Mid-Atlantic spray irrigation site. I quantified the presence of antibiotics using high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), and characterized total bacterial community structure using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. I also used HPLC-MS/MS to quantify the reduction of thirteen antimicrobials from conventionally treated reclaimed water after ZVI-biosand filtration. Statistical analyses included the Kruskal Wallis test, paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and differential abundance using normalization achieved by cumulative sum scaling. Activated sludge treatment used at all four WWTPs resulted in the reduction of some antibiotics and the increase of genera containing potentially pathogenic bacteria (Mycobacterium and Legionella). Treatment <b>plant</b> <b>chlorination</b> and spray irrigation site ultraviolet radiation (UV) treatment and open-air storage reduced the concentration of azithromycin and increased the relative abundance of Mycobacterium. ZVI-biosand filtration achieved significant reductions in azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, linezolid, oxolinic acid, pipemidic acid, penicillin and vancomycin. This research provided additional scientific evidence that activated sludge treatment and chlorination alone may not be sufficient for the removal of antimicrobials and potentially pathogenic bacteria from municipal wastewater and resulting reclaimed water. However, ZVI-biosand filtration may be an efficient reuse site technology for the reduction of antimicrobials from conventionally treated reclaimed water...|$|R

50|$|Worcester {{originally}} drew {{its water}} from the Hex River. The early water distribution method was very primitive. The water ran in over Joubert's Mill and then flowed in open channels through the town. The first reservoir and distribution pipes were built in 1875. In 1910 a diversion and storage dam had been constructed in Fairy Glen, followed by {{the completion of a}} filtration and <b>chlorination</b> <b>plant</b> in 1936. By 1945 Worcester started planning to build a proper water impounding scheme. Construction of the Stettynskloof Dam started in 1952. The work was undertaken by Beton und Monierbau Aktiengesellschaft of Düsseldorf, Germany. Dr. Heinz Schulze was the head engineer and work was completed in 1955.|$|E
50|$|The ore {{was crushed}} in a fifteen-stamp mill. The weight of stamps was seven {{hundred and fifty}} pounds, {{dropping}} seven inches 90 times per minute, and crushing through No. 5 round-punched screens. The duty per stamp was one and two-thirds tons per day. No rockbreakers or self-feeders were used, but {{the introduction of the}} same was contemplated. Steel shoes and iron dies were used. The sulphurets were saved on six Frue concentrators. The <b>chlorination</b> <b>plant</b> owned by the mine was formerly the property of the Merrifield Company. It contained one roasting furnace 75 x 10 ft inside measurement. It had a capacity of four tons per day; when sufficient sulphurets had accumulated, a run is made. The sulphurets of the Mountaineer Mine was usually treated in these works. The cost of treatment was $8 per ton. The mine was provided with water power throughout; three Pelton wheels were used: a 5 ft for plunger, and an 8 ft for hoisting. Power for the mill was obtained from a 5 ft wheel. Altogether a total of 75 inches of power water was used under a head of 120 ft feet.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{the end of}} {{occupation}} in June 1945 the government passed a law on the reconstruction and development of PFZA in {{the scope of the}} national program of fertiliser production for agriculture. The machines and devices removed from Mościce, with involvement of the crew, were successfully found - e.g. in Brzeg Dolny in Silesia. In 1945 the production of methanol on the small scale was started. In November 1946 the half-technological formalin installation was commissioned for public use and the law on the reconstruction of the <b>chlorination</b> <b>plant</b> was passed. Years 1947-1949 are the period of Three-Year Plan. The recovery of the stolen equipment allowed for commissioning of the installation for iron-chromic catalyst for carbon oxide conversion as soon as in May 1947 and in July - the installation for synthetic ammonia, next, the installation for technological nitric acid production and nitro-chalk (20.5% N). The installation of lime saltpetre was reconstructed in 1948 and launched a year later. In summer 1948 upon 8 months of reconstruction, the chlorine plant was commissioned. Chlorine obtained from salt electrolysis was the base material for production of chlorinated lime, hydrochloric acid, chlorobenzenes and chloronaphthalene waxes.|$|E
5000|$|In 1905, a {{swimming}} pond was excavated by manual labour {{as part of}} an unemployment relief scheme. It was located {{to the north of the}} Hollow Pond, close to the junction of Lea Bridge Road and Snaresbrook Road. It was locally known as [...] "the Batho", but it became notorious for being muddy and unhygienic. In 1923, the borough councils of Leyton and Walthamstow jointly agreed to fund its improvement, and in May 1932, a new lido or open-air swimming pool was opened by the Lord Mayor of London. At a cost of £6,000, it was an irregular oval shape with a 100 yd straight section for racing; a paved surround and changing rooms were built and the pool was fed by an underground spring. However, the new lido was closed in the following September, after a water sample had shown it to be [...] "unfit for bathing purposes". After another rebuilding, including the sealing of the floor of the pool with concrete and the installation of a <b>chlorination</b> <b>plant,</b> Whipps Cross Lido reopened in 1937. It was a very large pool, 300 ft long by 130 ft wide, with a connected circular diving pool 30 ft deep. By 1981, attendances had fallen to 20,000 per annum and the decision was taken to close the lido on 4 September 1982. By December 1983, the site had been levelled and returned to forest land; only part of the access road remains.|$|E

40|$|I n a Journal AWWA article {{published}} in 2006, the history of disinfection in the United States was explored {{in the context of}} eight revolutions representing major milestones in the protection of the public from waterborne diseases (McGuire, 2006). Included in the account of the first revolution was a short description of how Dr. John L. Leal conceived and implemented the first continuous use of chlorine in a US drink-ing water supply. At the beginning of the 20 th century, it took a court dispute and a legal deadline to clear away the objections and to apply what was until then only an experimental treatment method in the United States [...] John L.

40|$|Many {{cities across}} the country have {{experienced}} extreme water problems. The City of Portland has issued several water boiling advisories due to E. coli contamination. Additionally, there has been incidents of serious contaminants like lead leaching in water systems (Flint, Michigan). The Portland Water Bureau does not use a water treatment plant due to the quality of our water sources; a <b>chlorination</b> <b>plant</b> is used to chlorinate the water from the Bull Run Watershed (our main water source). Not having a water treatment plant makes Oregon more prone to a prolonged absence of potable water should the supply be contaminated. Up until three months ago, Portland had open reservoirs that exposed clean and treated water to the open-air environment, which allowed for recontamination. Despite those now being closed and not in use, Portland’s water system still has various gaps where water can be contaminated. Portland’s water usage peaks during the summer and tapers off just before kids go back to school. As a result of that decline in usage, a lot of water sits in pipes just waiting to be pumped to homes. The weather is still quite warm all the way through mid-September and possibly well into October. As a result the unused water sitting in pipes heats up with the weather and serves as a breeding ground for a plethora of bacteria and contaminants that pose putative short and long term health risks to the citizens of Portland. The city is equipped to detect E. coli and other contaminants—although not as quickly as we (the Water Bureau and the citizens) would hope. As of right now, we still test for E. coli the basic way: grow it in a LB petri dish, which takes up to three days. Should another outbreak occur, more people will get sick before the Bureau can call a city-wide water shutdown. Our current system simply is not practical, nor is it completely secure...|$|E
