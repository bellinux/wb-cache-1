40|$|Collection, storage, and {{ultimate}} land disposal of livestock feedlot runoff {{is becoming a}} more common practice {{as a result of}} increasing state and federal regulations prohibiting uncontrolled discharge of runoff. As a result of chemical, physical, and biological actions during the storage phase, the runoff applied to land from storage is often greatly different from that entering storage directly from the feedlot. This study was designed to observe those changes in the runoff during storage, and to evaluate their effect on land disposal practices. Six concrete paved feedlots with runoff control systems were studied, with emphasis on variations in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in holding ponds used for storing runoff. Seasonal variations in nutrient <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holding</b> ponds result from precipitation patterns, nutrient losses, and other factors. Early spring dewatering of the holding ponds, followed by frequent summer dewatering if possible, will result in the best conservation of nutrients. Large differences in nutrient content of holding ponds were observed for different species of livestock, with stored swine feedlot runoff containing nearly eight times as much nitrogen as stored beef feedlot runoff...|$|E

It is pointed that the identification of varieties is carried by the morphological characteristics description as presented in the table. Being standard these characteristics comply with ones requirements. An characteristics explanation with an asterisk (*) is given, their importance for the international harmonization of variety descriptions by States UPOV Members is indicated. The article presents {{an explanation of the}} grouping characteristics with documented revealing conditions. As it is commonly determined any characteristic begins with the plants or plants parts identification, which after a colon is followed by the body or its part nomination or by observed peculiarity. The requirements to the formulation of characteristics nomination are performed. It should be clear enough for understanding and without conditions determining. The degree of every characteristic nomination manifestation for its defining and making harmonizing descriptions is set. The corresponding numeric code, which facilitates the entry of data, drafting descriptions and their exchanging is given to each revealing degree. The morphological code configuration of variety phenotype is formed by the codes. It is emphasized that the features are divided into qualitative, quantitative and pseudo qualitative. The presentation order of the features in the table corresponds to the botanical or chronological order. It is noted that the Test guidelines should contain all the features suitable for holding examination at BOC and that there should not be any restrictions on their being included into Methods. Every feature can be used from a complete features list...|$|E

Taken utterly by surprise, the Danes could offer no effective resistance.

40|$|In <b>the</b> view <b>of</b> massive <b>content</b> {{explosion}} in World Wide Web through diverse sources, {{it has become}} mandatory to have content filtering tools. <b>The</b> filtering <b>of</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> web pages <b>holds</b> greater significance in cases of access by minor-age people.

DLAs are more metal rich than LLSs, although the metallicities in the LLS column density range (NHI = 10 ^ 17 - 10 ^ 20 cm^- 2) are relatively flat, evolving from a median HI-weighted metallicity of Z< 10 ^- 2 Zsol at z = 3 to ~ 10 ^- 0. 5 Zsol by z = 0. <b>The</b> metal <b>content</b> <b>of</b> HI systems tracks <b>the</b> increasing stellar <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universe, <b>holding</b> ~ 5 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> integrated total metals released from stars at z = 0.

40|$|This week’s written portion {{will give}} you {{practice}} with formalizing data structure invariants, as well as heaps and priority queues. You can either type up your solutions or write them neatly by hand, and you should submit your work in class on the due date just before lecture begins. Please remember to staple your written homework before submission. 1. 1 Hash Tables, Revisited Refer to the code (below) from the hash table interface we wrote in lecture. We wrote a specification function, is_ht, to check that a given ht is actually a hash table. bool is_ht(ht H) if (H = = NULL) return false; if (!(H->size> 0)) return false; //@assert H->size = = (H->A); return true; An obvious invariant of our hashtables is that every element of a chain hashes to <b>the</b> index <b>of</b> that chain.
