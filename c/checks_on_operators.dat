40|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the European Union Timber Regulation (EUTR) in March 2013, the Confederation of European Forest Owners (CEPF) carried out a survey, aimed at gathering the experiences, expectations and views of its members on the implementation process from a private forest owners’ perspective. The aim {{of this study is to}} stimulate the discussions within CEPF and to provide input to the forthcoming European Commission evaluation on the EUTR to be carried out in the course of 2015. This synthesis report entails the outcome of an online-based questionnaire, which includes the responses of fourteen CEPF members and was conducted between October and November 2014. Even though private forest owners are not the main concern of the EUTR and the impacts on their activities are expected to be limited, the results of the survey show that there are some critical issues that need further attention and consideration. In some CEPF Member States implementing the EUTR is a reason for concern from a private forest owners’ perspective. Overall, the respondents expect that the Regulation will bring an increase in bureaucracy and administrative costs for forest owners when selling timber, while not leading to desirable positive effects on the sales and value of domestic timber. In addition, the role and awareness of forest owners and their preparedness to comply with their new obligations has also emerged as a key concern, highlighted together with the need for further support, information and simplification of the processes. The results show further that the competent authorities enforce the EUTR to a varying extent and intensity, causing a great level of incoherency and inconsistency. Only in few cases the <b>checks</b> <b>on</b> <b>operators</b> to investigate possible non-compliance have started. This demonstrates that in many EU Member States the EUTR is still at an early stage of implementation...|$|E

40|$|We obtain all Dirichlet spaces Fq, q ∈ ℝ, of {{holomorphic}} functions on {{the unit}} ball of ℂN as weighted symmetric Fock spaces over ℂN. We develop the basics of <b>operator</b> theory <b>on</b> these spaces related to shift operators. We do a complete analysis {{of the effect of}} q ∈ ℝ in the topics we touch upon. Our approach is concrete and explicit. We use more function theory and reduce many proofs to <b>checking</b> results <b>on</b> diagonal <b>operators</b> <b>on</b> the Fq. We pick out the analytic Hilbert modules from among the Fq. We obtain von Neumann inequalities for row contractions on a Hilbert space with respect to each Fq. We determine the commutants and investigate the almost normality of the shift operators. We prove that the C∗-algebras generated by the shift <b>operators</b> <b>on</b> the Fq fit in exact sequences that are in the same Ext class. We identify the groups K 0 and K 1 of the Toeplitz algebras on the Fq arising in K-theory. Radial differential operators are prominent throughout. Some of our results, especially those pertaining to lower negative values of q, are new even for N = 1. Many of our results are valid in the more general weighted symmetric Fock spaces Fb that depend on a weight sequence b. © World Scientific Publishing Company...|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Two strips of U- 2 RC- 10 images were analytically triangulated and adjusted. Control points and pass points were marked on glass plates made from B&W copy negatives of IR color transparencies. A wild PUG- 3 and TA 1 /p monocomparator {{were used to}} mark and measure the points on the glass plates. Each plate was measured twice in the same orientation for a <b>check</b> <b>on</b> accuracy and <b>operator</b> error. The 22 photographs were adjusted to 41 ground control and tie points and the block adjustment was performed in a secant plane coordinate system to eliminate the effect of earth curvature. Standard deviations of the residuals of the control and tie points were 12. 8 m, 10. 8 m, and 4. 5 m for the X, Y, and Z coordinates respectively. The 12. 8 m and 10. 8 m figures correspond to an identification accuracy of 0. 1 mm on the U- 2 RC- 10 plates. The standard deviations of the residuals encountered in the ERTS- 1 resectioning were: (1) 0. 16 mm assuming uncorrected perspective geometry and (2) 0. 12 mm when the polynomial adjustment was added in. These results indicate a reduction of 0. 11 in the square error due to the polynomial adjustment...|$|R
