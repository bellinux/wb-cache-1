While the underlying pattern suggests better fit of risk profile to setting and a better fit of risk profile to the choice for interventions, the introduction of an extra hospital-based facility did not represent an up- or downward pressure towards <b>intervention</b> <b>rates</b> in general. Previous studies on birth centres showed lower <b>intervention</b> <b>rates</b> combined with an equal, or even better, performance (Gottvall et al. 2004; Gottvall et al. 2011; Laws et al. 2010). These studies, however, did not or only partially adjust for case mix differences (Gottvall et al. 2004; Gottvall et al. 2011; Laws et al. 2010).

While involuntary hospitalisation is established in practice around the world, the use of <b>compulsory</b> <b>interventions</b> outside of hospital â so called community treatment orders (CTOs) â is a more recent development. Three randomised controlled trials of CTO effectiveness have been conducted to date finding no benefits for patients in terms of reduced relapse and readmission to hospital. However, these trials have been relatively short (11 - 12 months) and focused almost exclusively on CTO effects on clinical functioning and service use. Little {{attention has been given}} to patients' social outcomes and broader welfare despite their recognised importance. A sub-sample (n = 121) from the Oxford Community Treatment Order Evaluation Trial (OCTET) were interviewed 48 -months after randomisation to assess whether the duration of the CTO intervention was associated with more or less favourable social outcomes at follow-up. Social outcomes were assessed using three main concepts: social networks (Study 1), social inclusion (Study 2), and capabilities (Study 3). No significant associations between the duration of the CTO intervention and social outcomes at follow-up were found. The association between involuntary hospitalisation and social outcomes was also tested but no significant associations were found. Because the field of social outcome measurement is relatively undeveloped, a further aim was to contribute to the validation and testing of two recently developed instruments: the Social and Community Opportunities Profile (SCOPE) (Study 4) and the Oxford Capability Questionnaire for Mental Health (OxCAP-MH) (Study 5). The SCOPE performed well overall as a measure of social inclusion but questions were raised about its feasibility (length) and the reliability of one of its sub-scales. The OxCAP-MH demonstrated good psychometric properties (reliability and validity) and represents a promising new multi-dimensional patient-reported outcome measure for use in mental health research. </p...|$|R

40|$|Discretion {{limits in}} cases about <b>compulsory</b> <b>interventions</b> is the Stein Rokkan Center for Social Studies first {{report from the}} {{evaluation}} of the Social Service Act Sections 6 - 2, 6 - 2 a and 6 - 3, funded by the Norwegian Directory of Health. The report studies the role of the social services in cases on <b>compulsory</b> <b>intervention</b> towards adult substance abusers, under Sections 6 - 2 and 6 - 2 a. In Norway, the formal decision for compulsory drug treatment is made by the County Board for Social Cases (Fylkesnemnda), a local board of social welfare. The municipality handles the cases through the social security office. Section 6 - 2 requires that the social services commit a substance abuser to treatment if the person, due to ongoing misuse, is seriously jeopardizes his/her physical or psychological health. Section 6 - 2 a makes it possible to institutionalize a pregnant substance abuser by force for the whole period of the pregnancy. Compulsory action may be implemented if it seems highly probable that the child would be born with injuries {{as a result of the}} mother’s substance abuse, and when voluntary efforts are insufficient. Though compulsory detention has been used in restricted manners, there has been a significant increase in the number of cases during the last ten years. In this report we explore this development by investigating how the social service agencies handle these cases and how coercion is justified during the decision-making process. In matters regarding application of Sections 6 - 2 and 6 - 2 a we found great differences both between counties, municipalities, social services offices and among the social workers. Variations in organizational factors such as leadership, human recourses, division of labour and administrative tools determine and limit the extent to which compulsory commitment is initiated. The social workers are positive when it comes to detention of pregnant substance abusers (Section 6 - 2 a), and they have no difficulties in interpreting or practicing the law. In Section 6 - 2 cases, however, we found that they gained a more positive attitude towards compulsory detention of adult substance abusers, although this varies. The most decisive factor in the application of the law is that to help individuals in a life-threatening situation. Detention of pregnant clients is justified by the consequences of the substance abuse on the foetus. An understanding of the law which focuses on diagnosed drug and alcohol related illness, gives the Specialist healthcare service a powerful role, because of their medical and psychiatric expertise. Also the social workers find it easier morally to intervene when they have a medical justification for the intervention, even though they risk damaging the relation with their clients. The problem with applying Section 6 - 2 as a way to intervene in emergency cases to prevent serious health damage and/or deadly outcome, is that the laws long-term goal to overcome misuse and motivate to further voluntary treatment fails. People with severe health problems does not necessarily profit from compulsory detention in the long term. The management of the actual detention is often challenging and represents a critical point, with sometimes fatal outcomes. Assistance by uniformed police, handcuffs, remand into custody and extensive use of force occurs often, and leads to unnecessary violations and has negative effects for the institutionalization of the substance abusers. Gendered practices in the social services are also highlighted in the report. While women constitute only between 25 and 30 % of the injection drug users in Norway, they stand for more than half of the <b>compulsory</b> <b>interventions</b> under Section 6 - 2. The fact that women are overrepresented can be explained by the fact that they more frequently are in contact with the social- and health care system. While the majority of the social workers are women themselves, there are more likely to occur gender specific identifications and more intimate communication with female clients than others. This gendered client–helper relation produce more worries for drug addicted women’s life situation and construct them as less autonomous and more vulnerable than men. The relation between the social services and the Specialist Healthcare Service can overall be characterized as tensed. A well developed collaboration between the two services is crucial in cases concerning <b>compulsory</b> <b>intervention.</b> However, the study reveals lack of and problematic collaboration in most regions and municipalities, although with some variations. Remarkably many social workers know very little about what the nearby institutions have to offer for different groups of clients. A significant problem between the two service levels is that economic barriers between the different health regions prevent free flow of patients. Some of the substance abusers do not have any offer to further treatment on voluntary basis when the <b>compulsory</b> <b>intervention</b> is finished, even though they are motivated. If there are no arrangements that secure the patients rights to further treatment, the purpose of the detention fails. However, the most critical factor under the present conditions, is the legal protection of patients with dual diagnoses. A «blame game» has developed between the social services – the psychiatric specialist healthcare services and the specialist substance abuse services, fighting over which services are responsible for these patients. This especially vulnerably group of clients often experience problems in getting admission at all, and if they are admitted, they suffer from a lack of treatment addressing their specific needs...|$|R

40|$|Summary: This article {{uses the}} concept of {{citizenship}} to explore the recent mental health statutes within England and Wales and within Scotland. It argues that differences in the content, and practice context, herald a parting {{of the ways in}} mental health social work in the United Kingdom. Findings: The author focuses on three key differences: the reciprocity principle, the grounds for compulsory treatment and the place of social work within <b>compulsory</b> <b>intervention</b> to demonstrate how the statutes have led to more limited legal, procedural and social rights in England and Wales than in Scotland. The result for social work is that the practice context created in England and Wales may become more risk averse and that social work services may have a more residual role within statutory mental health work. The differences described in this article may also reflect increasing post-devolution divergence in the provision of social work services across the four countries that make up the United Kingdom. Applications: Further research is needed to explore if these divergences, within mental health law and policy, are in practice supporting or limiting citizenship...|$|R
40|$|Most {{patients}} with acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage are managed conservatively or with endoscopic intervention but some ultimately require surgery {{to arrest the}} haemorrhage. We have conducted a population-based multicentre prospective observational study of management and outcomes. This paper concerns the subgroup of 307 patients who had an operation because of continued or recurrent haemorrhage or high risk of further bleeding. The principal diagnostic group was those with peptic ulcer. Of 2071 {{patients with}} peptic ulcer presenting with acute haemorrhage, 251 (12 %) had an operative intervention with a mortality of 24 %. In the non-operative group mortality was 10 %. The operative <b>intervention</b> <b>rate</b> increased with risk score, ranging from 0 % in the lowest risk categories to 38 % in the highest. Much of the discrepancy between operative and non-operative mortality was explainable by case mix; however, for high-risk cases mortality was significantly higher in the operated group. In 78 % of patients who underwent an operation for bleeding peptic ulcer {{there had been no}} previous attempt at endoscopic haemostasis. For patients admitted to surgical units, the operative <b>intervention</b> <b>rate</b> was about four times higher than for those admitted under medical teams. In patients with acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage operative intervention is infrequent and largely confined to the highest-risk patients. The continuing high mortality in surgically treated patients is therefore to be expected. The reasons for the low use of endoscopic treatment before surgery are not revealed by this study, but wider use of such treatments might further reduce the operative <b>intervention</b> <b>rate.</b> Physicians and surgeons have not yet reached consensus on who needs surgery and when...|$|R
30|$|One of the {{concerns}} raised regarding the Dutch Perinatal Care System is whether the small additional risk on adverse perinatal outcome (perinatal mortality and intrapartum related neonatal morbidities) of home deliveries is of fact by the claimed advantage of lower <b>intervention</b> <b>rates</b> compared to planned hospital births (Ackermann-Liebrich et al. 1996; Hutton et al. 2009; Janssen et al. 2002; Lindgren et al. 2008; Olsen 1997; Wiegers et al. 1996; van der Kooy et al. 2011). Birth centres adjacent to hospitals have been proposed a new setting that combines the advantages of both home and hospital, resulting lower <b>intervention</b> <b>rates</b> with equal safety (Chervenak et al. 2013; Hodnett et al. 2005; Hundley et al. 1994; Waldenstrom et al. 1997). They are designed to provide an intermediate option of care between home and hospital birth for low risk women. Despite existing organization differences, birth centre care generally includes a homelike, nonclinical environment, a rather autonomous midwifery practice, {{and a commitment to}} and belief in normal, physiologic birth (Hodnett et al. 2005; Hundley et al. 1994; Coyle et al. 2001).|$|R
