40|$|Increasing {{longevity}} {{and the growing}} proportion of the aged in the population in most countries have served {{to focus on the}} question of how governments and older people can finance living, health, and care options in retirement.

40|$|Outreach has a {{long history}} in health and social service {{programs}} as an important method for reaching at-risk persons within their communities. One method of "outreach" is based on the recruitment of networks of community members (or "networkers") to deliver HIV prevention messages and materials {{in the context of their}} social networks and everyday lives. This paper documents the experiences of the AIDS <b>Community</b> <b>Demonstration</b> Projects in recruiting networkers to deliver HIV prevention interventions to high-risk populations, including injecting drug users not in treatment; female sex partners of injecting drug users; female sex traders; men who have sex with men but do not self-identify as gay; and youth in high-risk situations. The authors interviewed project staff and reviewed project records of the implementation of community networks in five cities. Across cities, the projects successfully recruited persons into one or more community networks to distribute small media materials, condoms, and bleach kits, and encourage risk-reduction behaviors among community members. Networkers' continuing participation was enlisted through a variety of monetary and nonmonetary incentives. While continuous recruitment of networkers was necessary due to attrition, most interventions reported maintaining a core group of networkers. In addition, the projects appeared to serve as a starting point for some networkers to become more active in other community events and issues...|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that homeless individuals&mdash;particularly those {{with substance abuse}} problems or mental illness&mdash;are unable to access {{the full range of}} available benefits and com-munity services on their own. In recent years, community service providers have increasingly looked toward case management as the intervention of choice for solving this problem. Yet the evaluation findings of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism <b>Community</b> <b>Demonstration</b> Program, which included three case management projects, showed few clear indications of case management effectiveness. The results of these studies&mdash;which focused on homeless clients with alcohol and other drug problems&mdash;are consistent with studies of case management services for the homeless mentally ill. This article identifies several phenom-ena that potentially explain the apparent lack of positive effects and suggests that the reasons for negative findings may lie as much with the evaluations as with the interventions. These phenomena include bias due to differential attrition from measurement, lack of intervention intensity, lack of distinction between groups, contextual factors, and additional design and measurement issues. Suggestions for improving future evaluations of case management effec-tiveness are offered. It {{is generally}} believed that homeless individuals-particularly thoseI with substance abuse problems or mental illness-are unable to access the full range of available benefits and community services on thei...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the adoption, by the New Labour government, of a mixed communities approach to the renewal of disadvantaged neighbourhoods in England. It argues that while there are continuities with previous policy, the new approach represents a more neoliberal policy turn in three respects: its identification of concentrated poverty as the problem; its faith in market-led regeneration; and its alignment with a new urban policy agenda in which cities are gentrified and remodelled as sites for capital accumulation through entrepreneurial local governance. The article then draws on evidence from the early phases of {{the evaluation of the}} mixed <b>community</b> <b>demonstration</b> projects to explore how the new policy approach is playing out at a local level, where it is layered upon existing policies, politics and institutional relationships. Tensions between neighbourhood and strategic interests, community and capital are evident as the local projects attempt neighbourhood transformation, while seeking to protect the rights and interests of existing residents. Extensive community consultation efforts run parallel with emergent governance structures, in which local state and capital interests combine and communities may effectively be disempowered. Policies and structures are still evolving and it is not yet entirely clear how these tensions will be resolved, especially in the light of a collapsing housing market, increased poverty and demand for affordable housing, and a shortage of private investment. ...|$|E
40|$|The AIDS <b>Community</b> <b>Demonstration</b> Projects are multicenter {{prevention}} projects directing community-based {{interventions to}} members of hard-to-reach groups at risk of infection from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The projects are supported by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Interventions are derived from theories of behavior change and have as their goal reducing HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in the communities. The current objectives, intentionally narrow to improve the project's specificity and clarity, are to increase the use of condoms in sexual activity {{and the use of}} bleach to clean injecting drug equipment. Additional objectives may be added. The impact of the interventions is seen in increases in the use of HIV counseling and testing services, decreases in all or specific sexual and drug-use risk behaviors, and requests for related social and public health services. A quasi-experimental research design is being used to evaluate the projects. Multiple evaluation measures are used, including a street-based interview with randomly identified respondents in both intervention and control communities. Success in facilitating HIV and AIDS risk reduction is being measured using a model of behavior change describing stages of change. Upon successful completion of these projects in 1994, CDC may be able to offer models of effective, feasible, and easy-to-monitor State and local health departments and community-based organizations...|$|E

The TETD included a much larger sample of beneficiaries than did STETS (745 versus 467) in 13 <b>demonstration</b> <b>communities,</b> which allowed for a more rigorous evaluation of program impacts.
