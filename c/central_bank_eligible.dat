40|$|In a dual {{liquidity}} crisis, {{both the}} government and the banking sector are under severe funding stress. By nature, dual crises have the potential of being particularly disruptive and damaging. Thus, understanding their mechanics, how they unfold and how they can be addressed under various monetary and international financial regimes, is crucial. We capture the logic of a dual crisis through a new, rigorous approach. A closed system of financial accounts allows for a systematic comparative review of underlying liquidity shocks as well as built-in liquidity buffers, including their limits beyond which a credit crunch materializes. Based on this we are able to (i) make precise the otherwise vague interpretations of liquidity flows and policy options; (ii) compare capacities to absorb shocks under alternative international financial systems; (iii) explain how various constraints interact; (iv) draw lessons for achieving higher resilience against self-fulfilling confidence crises. Most importantly, we analyze the role of a number of potential constraints to an elastic central bank liquidity provision, namely the availability of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> <b>eligible</b> assets, limits deliberately imposed on the central bank`s ability to lend to or purchase assets of banks and governments (including monetary financing prohibitions), and limits in a fixed exchange rate regime relating to the gold or foreign currency reserves of the central bank...|$|E

40|$|The {{endogenous}} {{theory of}} money, developed by Basil Moore, {{argues that the}} supply of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> money in modern economies is not {{under the control of}} the <b>central</b> <b>bank.</b> According to this view, a <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> typically supplies cash reserves automatically on demand at its minimum lending rate, resulting in a clearly horizontal money supply function. While the paper agrees with Moore that the supply of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> money cannot be determined exogenously by the <b>central</b> <b>bank,</b> it wonders whether the supply is determined completely by the demand of the commercial banks. The paper suggests that the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> has some exogenous power to control the quantity of its supply by rationing. More importantly, the <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> is forced to do so! The <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> cannot not merely exist as an automat responding to the wishes of the commercial banks.

The GFC highlighted the need for a broader responsibility for and oversight of financial stability, not only in domestic economies, but in the world as a whole (G- 20, 2010). This responsibility may become the primary responsibility of <b>central</b> <b>banks,</b> as they may be the best institutions to oversee financial stability generally, or at least play an important or lead role in financial stability.
