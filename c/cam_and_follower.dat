40|$|Elastohydrodynamic {{lubrication}} is {{the phenomenon}} {{that occurs when}} a lubricant is introduced between surfaces that are in rolling contact such as rolling bearing. Elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) is an important branch of the lubrication theory, describing lubrication mechanisms in non conformal contacts widely found in many mechanical components such as various gears, rolling bearings, <b>cams</b> <b>and</b> <b>followers,</b> metal-rolling tools, traction drives, and continuous variable transmissions. In present work, the elastohydrodynamic (EHD) lubricant film thicknesses for bearings 6007, 6207, 6307 and 6407 are calculated by the formula based on Hertz’s contact theory.

50|$|A <b>cam</b> <b>and</b> <b>follower</b> {{is formed}} by the direct contact of two {{specially}} shaped links. The driving link is called the cam (also see cam shaft) and the link that is driven through the direct contact of their surfaces is called the follower. The shape of the contacting surfaces of the <b>cam</b> <b>and</b> <b>follower</b> determines {{the movement of the}} mechanism. In general a cam follower mechanism's energy is transferred from cam to follower. The cam shaft is rotated and, according to the cam profile, the follower moves up and down. Now slightly different types of eccentric cam followers are also available in which energy is transferred from the follower to the cam. The main benefit of this type of cam follower mechanism is that the follower moves a little bit and helps to rotate the cam 6 times more circumference length with 70% force.|$|E

50|$|A {{mechanism}} is a device designed to transform input forces and movement into a desired set of output forces and movement.

50|$|The engine {{normally}} {{operates the}} valves by pushing on the stems with <b>cams</b> <b>and</b> <b>cam</b> <b>followers.</b> The shape <b>and</b> {{position of the}} cam determines the valve lift and when and how quickly (or slowly) the valve is opened. The cams are normally placed on a fixed camshaft which is then geared to the crankshaft, running at half crankshaft speed in a four-stroke engine. On high-performance engines, the camshaft is movable <b>and</b> the <b>cams</b> have a varying height so, by axially moving the camshaft in relation with the engine RPM, the valve lift also varies.

50|$|This system {{consists}} of a cam lobe that varies along its length (similar to a cone shape). One end of the cam lobe has a short duration/reduced lift profile, and the other end has a longer duration/greater lift profile. In between, the lobe provides a smooth transition between these two profiles. By shifting area of the cam lobe which is {{in contact with the}} follower, the lift and duration can be continuously altered. This is achieved by moving the camshaft axially (sliding it across the engine) so a stationary follower is exposed to a varying lobe profile to produce different amounts of lift and duration. The downside to this arrangement is that the <b>cam</b> <b>and</b> <b>follower</b> profiles must be carefully designed to minimise contact stress (due to the varying profile).|$|E
