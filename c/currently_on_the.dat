5|$|Construction officially {{began in}} October 2013, {{with the new}} spans being built {{to the north of}} the {{existing}} bridge. The new bridge will connect to the existing highway approaches of I-87 and I-287 on both river banks. The northbound/westbound span opened on August 25, 2017. Southbound/eastbound traffic remained on the old bridge until October 6, 2017. At that point, southbound/eastbound traffic shifted to the westbound span of the new bridge and the old bridge closed. When completed in 2018, including the new eastbound span (to carry lanes <b>currently</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> westbound span), the new Tappan Zee Bridge will be one of the longest cable-stayed spans in the nation.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Richard Bellman {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} a database to solve chess and checkers endgames using retrograde analysis. Instead of analyzing forward from the position <b>currently</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> board, the database would analyze backward from positions where one player was checkmated or stalemated. Thus, a chess computer would no longer need to analyze endgame positions during the game because they were solved beforehand. It would no longer make mistakes because the tablebase always played the best possible move.|$|E

5|$|The WWE Championship is a {{professional}} wrestling championship in WWE, <b>currently</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> SmackDown brand. It is the first world title established in WWE, having been introduced in 1963 as the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) World Heavyweight Championship. The promotion was renamed World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1979 and ended its affiliation with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) in 1983, with the title also renamed to reflect the changes.|$|E
5|$|The second series {{takes place}} {{some time after}} the events of series one. It is {{mentioned}} that John, Medley and Lioba help lead an uprising of the rogue avatars which resulted in Planet B declaring all rogues to be outlaws. Lioba has changed her appearance and voice and is <b>currently</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> run from the Planet B corporation. The whereabouts of John are unknown, and it is implied that Medley has been killed by Cerberus, who has since lost his job and is now killing both rogue and human controlled avatars as he sees fit.|$|E
5|$|Carlisle is an {{ambassador}} for the Kick It Out scheme, which campaigns for inclusion and equality in football. He is also <b>currently</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Management Committee of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), {{and it was}} announced on 17 November 2010 that Carlisle would succeed Chris Powell {{as the chairman of}} the PFA. As part of his work with the PFA, he collects the views of his fellow professionals and reports back to the committee. He also visits local schools to give talks to the students. Carlisle was among those who criticised FIFA president Sepp Blatter following his comments in November 2011 that racism was no longer a problem in football. In February 2012, he was part of a PFA delegation that met with British Prime Minister David Cameron to discuss the issues of racism and homophobia in the sport.|$|E

5|$|In the Pacific Northwest {{there is}} a stark {{contrast}} in Riesling production. The grape is <b>currently</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rise in Washington State but on the decline in neighboring Oregon. Riesling from this area ranges from dry to sweet, and has a crisp lightness that bodes well for easy drinking. Often {{there will be an}} easily detectable peach and mineral complex. Some Washington State winemakers, such as Chateau Ste. Michelle, are adapting German-style Riesling production methods, and even partnering with well-known German vintners like Dr. Ernest Loosen to create specialty wines such as the Eroica Riesling. With annual productions of over 2,000,000 cases a year, Chateau Ste. Michelle is the worldwide leader in the production of Riesling wines by volume. In 2007 Pacific Rim Winemakers, another Pacific Northwest winery and owned by Randall Grahm of Bonny Doon, has built the first wine facility in Red Mountain AVA dedicated completely to Riesling production.|$|E
5|$|The {{team also}} faced {{uncertainty}} relating to {{who would be}} the starting quarterback. While it was expected that Tate Forcier would retain his starting job, the build-up to the season led to a quarterback controversy that turned into a three way battle between Forcier, Denard Robinson, and highly touted recruit Devin Gardner. On defense, Michigan installed a new 3–3–5 formation that the coaches hoped would better suit the players <b>currently</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team. Michigan lost several key players from the previous season, including DE Brandon Graham, the 2009 Big Ten defensive Most Valuable Player, RB's Brandon Minor and Carlos Brown, LB Stevie Brown, and CB Donovan Warren. Michigan suffered a severe blow to its defensive secondary during fall practice, as starting CB Troy Woolfolk suffered a dislocated ankle that ended his season before it began.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{categories}} of Antoinists: desservants who perform worship, people who wear the religious clothing, regular faithful who attend the service every week, and occasional members or visitors. As its {{aim is to}} heal and comfort through faith, Antoinism does not seek to convert new people. The number of followers is difficult to assess as there are no statistics established by the religion. After a period of rapid growth in Belgium, the number of followers is <b>currently</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> decline {{in the country and}} some temples were forced to close due to lack of money or faithful; for example, in 2003, Human Rights Without Frontiers counted less than 150 worshipers in the country. In France, however, the religion remains active and counts about 2,500 regular members. Estimates of the worldwide membership vary from few thousand to 200,000. The future growth of the number of followers, however, can be affected by certain rules of the group. As it does not practice proselytism, Antoinism suffers from a lack of social visibility and many people are unaware even of Antoinist temples in their neighborhood. Moreover, because of the availability required for worship and the absence of income in the religion, dressed members and desservants are often old-age retired people.|$|E
