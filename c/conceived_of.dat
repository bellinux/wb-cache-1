50|$|Another {{argument}} for the substance theory is the argument from conception. The argument claims {{that in order to}} <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> an object's properties, like the redness of an apple, one must <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> the object that has those properties. According to the argument, one cannot <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> redness, or any other property, distinct from the substance that has that property.|$|R

Chan is a detective for the Honolulu police, though many stories feature Chan traveling the world as he investigates mysteries and solves crimes.|$|E
5|$|Deodato said he <b>conceived</b> <b>of</b> {{the film}} while {{talking to his}} son about news {{coverage}} of the terrorism of the Red Brigades.

50|$|Individuals who <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> an {{authoritative}} God and a benevolent God both see God as taking an interventionist role in believers lives.They differ, however, {{in how they}} see God intervening.Those who <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> {{an authoritative}} God imagine God intervenes to punish those who lapse from his rules, {{and are likely to}} be white males.Those who <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> a benevolent God imagine God intervenes to rescue and present alternatives, and are likely to be female.|$|R
50|$|Regardless {{of their}} description, Platonic realism holds that {{universals}} do {{exist in a}} broad, abstract sense, although not at any spatial or temporal distance from people's bodies.

40|$|In {{addition}} to <b>conceiving</b> <b>of</b> such imaginary scenarios as those involving philosophical zombies, we may <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> such things being conceived. Call these higher order conceptions ‘meta-conceptions’. Sorensen (2006) holds {{that one can}} entertain a meta-conception without thereby <b>conceiving</b> <b>of</b> the embedded lower-order conception. So it seems that I can meta-conceive possibilities which I cannot conceive. If this is correct, then meta-conceptions provide a counter-example to the claim that possibility entails conceivability. Moreover, some of Sorensen’s discussion suggests the following argument: if the conceivability of some proposition entails its possibility, then the meta-conceivability of some proposition entails its possibility; but we can meta-conceive impossibilities; so conceivability doesn’t entail possibility. In this paper, I’ll argue that one cannot entertain a meta-conception without thereby <b>conceiving</b> <b>of</b> the embedded lower-order conception. And so we can neither meta-conceive impossibilities nor meta-conceive possibilities of which we cannot thereby conceive...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Framing {{prostitution}} as {{an economic}} exchange, this paper evaluates some of the consequences <b>of</b> <b>conceiving</b> <b>of</b> sex as a commodity {{rather than as an}} aspect of an intimate interpersonal relationship among the customers of prostitutes. Subjects were 700 men arrested while trying to hire street prostitutes. Questionnaires were administered prior to intervention programs designed to discourage re-offense in San Francisco, California (N= 588); Portland, Oregon (N= 82); and Las Vegas, Nevada (N= 30). Significant predictors <b>of</b> <b>conceiving</b> <b>of</b> sex as a commodity included being unmarried, having served in the military, and more frequent visits to prostitutes. <b>Conceiving</b> <b>of</b> sex as a commodity significantly predicted rape myth acceptance, attraction to violent sexuality, less frequent use of condoms while with prostitutes, support for prostitution, and the attitude that prostitution is positive for women. We argue that that <b>conceiving</b> <b>of</b> sex as a commodity has a number of negative implications for the men involved, their sexual partners, and for gender relations in general...|$|R
5|$|After the {{unexpected}} loss of Armendáriz, production proceeded, experiencing complications from uncredited rewrites by Berkely Mather during filming. Editor Peter Hunt set about editing the film while key elements were {{still to be}} filmed, helping to restructure the opening scenes. Hunt and Young <b>conceived</b> <b>of</b> moving the Red Grant training sequence {{to the beginning of}} the film (prior to the main title), a signature feature that has been an enduring hallmark of every Bond film since. The briefing with Blofeld was rewritten, and back projection was used to re-film Lotte Lenya's lines.|$|E
5|$|Among several {{projects}} for memorials, Zvi Hecker designed the solemn Page Memorial (1996) with Micha Ullmann and Eyal Weizman. This site-specific memorial commemorates the Jewish community of Kreuzberg, and their Lindenstrasse synagogue {{which was designed}} in 1891 by architects Cremer & Wolffenstein. What was {{once one of the}} largest religious buildings in Berlin, with a capacity of 1800; was ruined by the Nazis in the 1938 Kristallnacht pogrom. On the original floor plan, the benches of the synagogue were recreated in concrete, and where the bimah stood, trees are now planted. The designers <b>conceived</b> <b>of</b> the benches as sentences on the pages of the Talmud.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20thcentury, the teachings of Tenrikyo's foundress Oyasama became popular throughout Japan. In the following decades, the most devoted followers coalesced around Oyasama's residence in rural Nara, which she had perceived as the birthplace of the world, or Jiba. The six villages surrounding the Jiba slowly became filled with Tenrikyo ministers, mystics, and evangelists, and the area was urbanized. A popular international school (now Tenri University) and Tenri Central Library, built by followers, were also attracting a variety of people to the area. It was around this time that Tenrikyo's Second Shinbashira (community leader) Shōzen Nakayama <b>conceived</b> <b>of</b> creating a grand construction project as a testament to the loyalty of Oyasama's followers.|$|E

He started work in 1787, composing the first two quartets in February. In April, Haydn received a letter from King Frederick William II of Prussia, praising Haydn for the copies of the Paris symphonies that he had sent. The letter enclosed a golden ring. Haydn sought to return the favour by dedicating the Opus 50 set to the King, and Artaria acceded to Haydn's request to do so.|$|E

Although the team played 107 matches, including 74 in the British Isles, Warbrick took part in only 21 matches due to injury. The tour, the first from the Southern Hemisphere to visit Britain, remains the longest in rugby's history. In 2008 Warbrick and the Natives were inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame.|$|E

40|$|A natural {{resource}} is not given, but depends on human knowledge for its exploitation. Thus a 'unit of resource' is, {{to a significant}} degree, a 'unit of meaning', and education is potentially important {{not only for the}} use of resources but also for their creation. The paper draws on poststructuralism to confirm the intuition that it would be misleading to <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> 'units' of meaning. However, it is commonly acceptable to <b>conceive</b> <b>of</b> 'units' of resource, as in much discussion around sustainability; but, if the latter concept is suspect, then so is the former. The error seems to arise from the assumption of identifiable points in space-time, already problematised by quantum mechanics and poststructuralism. <b>Conceiving</b> <b>of</b> 'now' as a moving in and with time, rather than as a point in time, human survival is construed as an ongoing process of meaning-making constrained though not determined by the carrying capacity of the planet. The Second Nature conception of John McDowell is critiqued with respect to this...|$|R
5|$|Inspired by {{the mundane}} sight of pebbles {{rolling in the}} Baltic Sea surf {{in the summer of}} 1921, Döblin began writing Berge Meere und Giganten that fall, {{conducting}} extensive research into various natural and human sciences in the process. Although he had originally <b>conceived</b> <b>of</b> it as a hymn to the city and technology, over the course of writing the novel it evolved into a tribute to the power of nature.

5|$|Jains {{believe that}} karma is a {{physical}} substance that is everywhere in the universe. Karma particles are attracted to the soul {{by the actions of}} that soul. Karma particles are attracted when we do, think, or say things, when we kill something, when we lie, when we steal and so on. Karma not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also <b>conceived</b> <b>of</b> as an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (leśyā). Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in various states of existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.|$|E
5|$|Lars' {{inclusion}} in Naruto Shipuuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 was initially <b>conceived</b> <b>of</b> by CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama. In 2009, Matsuyama {{read in a}} Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine that Lars' third costume had been designed by Kishimoto and thought he {{should be included in}} Ultimate Ninja Storm 2. As a result, Matsuyama approached Tekken 6 producer Suguru Sasaki and his team and asked them to include Lars in the game using Kishimoto's outfit. Once this was approved, the Tekken staff started assisting CyberConnect2 to adjust Lars' moves to fit the other characters in the Naruto game. When the work was concluded, Matsuyama was surprised at how well Lars fitted in with the game's cast.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{reallocation}} {{of authority}} upwards, downwards, and sideways from central states has drawn attention from {{a growing number}} of scholars in political science. Yet beyond agreement that governance has become (and should be) multi-level, there is no consensus about how it should be organized. This article draws on several literatures to distinguish two types of multi-level governance. One type <b>conceives</b> <b>of</b> dispersion of authority to generalpurpose, non-intersecting, and durable jurisdictions. A second type <b>of</b> governance <b>conceives</b> <b>of</b> task-specific, intersecting, and flexible jurisdictions. We conclude by specifying the virtues of each type of governance. ...|$|R
