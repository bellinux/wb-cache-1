40|$|According to EU’s Innovation Union Scoreboard from 2015, Norway is a {{moderate}} innovator performing below the EU average for most dimensions and most indicators of innovation. Furthermore, {{according to research}} conducted by BI Norwegian Business School, less than 4 out of 100 Norwegian companies are exporting goods and services abroad; which implies that internationalization {{is not on the}} agenda for the majority of Norwegian companies. This is further supported by Global Entrepreneurship Monitor which highlights that Norwegian entrepreneurial companies are distinguished by a very low score (5 %) compared to other innovation-driven countries in relation to having ambitions of employing more than 19 employees in 5 years. In other words, Norwegian entrepreneurs have extremely low growth ambitions. Based on this, in addition to the downturn in the Norwegian oil industry which has resulted in more than 35 000 jobs being cut since 2014, Norway is now, more than ever, dependent on finding new business opportunities in order to secure the future economy. In accordance with this necessity, and the lack of international growth ambitions among Norwegian companies, we formulated the following research question: How <b>can</b> <b>Norwegian</b> entrepreneurial companies become international “growth champions”? With emphasis on marketing communication within the B 2 B technology sector. Based on the issues presented above, we have chosen to further study the following underlying areas of importance: Norway as an inferior innovator compared to our neighboring countries; the framework conditions of Norway, the importance of marketing communication in relation to achieving international expansion, and the development of an effective marketing communication. To gain the necessary and sufficient data in order to conduct this research, we have carried out a qualitative study consisting of 15 in-depth interviews with individuals we believe are very knowledgeable and relevant for our area of research. These individuals include successful Norwegian entrepreneurs and advisors within the field of entrepreneurship and internationalization. Throughout our analysis and discussion, we linked the theoretical framework towards our findings from both primary and secondary sources. Through extensive interpretations, analysis and discussion of our collected data, several discoveries were made; enabling us to draw conclusions. Based on our conducted research, we discovered that the framework conditions among the Nordic countries are rated as approximately equivalent, despite the fact that Norway is {{a moderate}} innovator while Sweden, Denmark and Finland are all innovation leaders. This implies that Norway’s shortcomings related to innovative performance may be a result of other factors, e. g. global ambitions and marketing knowledge. In addition, our findings stress that Norwegians, in general, have insufficient export and growth ambitions and low willingness to pursue entrepreneurship. In other words, the Norwegian entrepreneurial culture and ambitions are inadequate; implying that the main obstacle towards international entrepreneurship is the entrepreneurs own psychological barriers. In order to become an international growth champion, a drastic change of the Norwegian culture and mindset towards entrepreneurship and international expansion is therefore necessary. Furthermore, our research has clearly stated the importance of conducting marketing communication in order to achieve international success. Even though marketing communication is both product- and industry-dependent, our research indicates that it is critical for rapid global growth. As the heart of business lies in marketing, focus on, and the creation of, solid marketing communication is invaluable. In this regard, we established the 10 commandments for international growth champions, which we believe will function as an effective “toolbox” in order for Norwegian entrepreneurial companies to internationalize faster and better; i. e. achieve international success...|$|R

However, with climate change, economic vulnerability {{and the increase in}} sustainable alternatives to oil in mind, there is now an opportunity to move away from oil. Previous oil-discourses that the {{oil industry}} and pro-oil politicians promote can be considered as slowing down this change. This master’s thesis aim is to discover emerging discourses that are critical to the Norwegian oil industry and discourses that are counter to the positive oildiscourses. Discovering such discourses <b>can</b> enlighten <b>Norwegians</b> about the flaws of the oil industry and give reasons to move away from oil. Letters to the editor published in three national newspapers, Aftenposten, Dagens Næringsliv and Verdens Gang, were examined throughout the year 2013. In these newspapers emerging discourses were discovered through a critical discourse analysis. With the thesis objective Understand and identify discourses critical to the oil industry produced by the Norwegian people in Norwegian media during 2013 seven emerging discourses were discovered: Division of the Norwegian economy, Pro-oil politics, A happy ending to the oil adventure, Oil is bad for the environment, Listen to the global community, Turning a blind eye (Climate sinners with a good conscience) and Spewing oil onto global markets. Some of these discourses are fairly new and others are based on thoughts that have been circulating for a while.

We are exposing our remaining natural areas around the world to a tremendous pressure. Taking care of our natural resources is more important than ever. Interpretation can contribute to increased visitor knowledge, enhance visitor experience and create a desire in the tourists to preserve nature. The national parks in the United States are pioneers in interpretation and facilitation. This thesis focuses mainly on why and how Denali National Park and Preserve uses interpretation. Considered the US’ long tradition, knowledge and research on interpretation, is it also natural to consider whether there is a transfer value to other national parks, for instance, the Norwegian national park system. My research objectives were (1) why and (2) how Denali National Park and Preserve is using interpretation, (3) which benefits interpretation gives Denali, (4) how they measure and evaluate the benefits of interpretation, and finally (5) if Denali’s interpretation strategy can benefit others, for instance, Norwegian national parks. I used document analysis as method, based on a case study of Denali National Park and Preserve. The results show that the main reason for using interpretation in Denali is the benefits it provides. Interpretation can improve the visitor experience, provide knowledge and increase the visitor’s appreciation of a place or a resource, which can improve the protection of vulnerable resources. This corresponds with the benefits Denali claims their interpretation achieves. Denali uses interpretation in many different ways, and includes interpretation in many elements of the park. Evaluation and measuring of the interpretation is performed through questionnaires, observation and conversations with visitors. Several elements from Denali National Park and Preserve's interpretation strategy <b>can</b> benefit <b>Norwegian</b> national parks if implemented correctly. However, differences in management, traditions and economy limits the degree of transferability. Overall, the results correspond well with the theory, and this analysis can give inspiration and knowledge to other national parks...|$|R
