The usefulness of <b>competing</b> <b>risks</b> analysis in engineering reliability has been recognized since the 1960 s, and several important models in <b>competing</b> <b>risks</b> analysis were developed in the context of reliability modeling [e. g., Marshall-Olkin (1967) model].

40|$|The present paper makes a {{link between}} the {{literature}} on competing risks and that of opportunistic maintenance. Three models for <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> involving censoring through opportunistic maintenance are discussed. One is an existing opportunistic maintenance model, one is a new opportunistic variant on an existing <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> model, and the third is a new model that captures the notion of opportunistic informative maintenance. These models show that even though opportunities may occur according to a process that is independent of the failure process, the appropriate <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> models may still involve dependencies. This work was motivated by observation of practices in a coal-fired power plant consisting of four generating units, which is briefly described. Through simulation examples it is shown how these <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> models can be used to support decision making about maintenance rules, and the identifiability issues associated with the models are discussed. <b>Competing</b> <b>risk</b> theory addresses statistical estimation problems which are a common concern in much of the maintenance literature, and focuses attention on non-age-related information available to maintainers...|$|E

Patients with type 2 diabetes participating in the observational ZODIAC study were included. Prediction models for (micro) albuminuria and 50 % increase in serum creatinine (SCr) were developed using Cox regression and <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> analyses. Model performance was assessed by discrimination and calibration. During a total follow-up period of 10 years, 183 out of 640 patients (28. 6 %) with normoalbuminuria developed (micro) albuminuria, and 22 patients (3. 4 %) died without developing (micro) albuminuria (i. e. experienced the competing event).

In the context of censoring that occurs at least in part from competing risks, this assumption is rarely tenable. For that reason, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using a discrete-time failure model for death as the censoring event. The approach used in these analyses created two models for the informative censoring mechanism as a function of covariates and then used predicted probabilities of censoring to derive adjustment weights (2, 3). Modeling the censoring mechanism. The first model used pooled regression to estimate the risk of censoring from the <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> as a function of time and all possible baseline covariates (and interactions) that predict the <b>competing</b> <b>risk.</b> To achieve this result, in a discrete-time failure model with time as a covariate, patients censored for reasons other than competing risks were included in the dataset until the time of censoring. The time interval was from the start of follow-up until the patient had the <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> or was censored for another reason. Time was grouped to reduce model complexity. The outcome in this model was the binary indicator for the <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> event.

This model is widely studied in the medical, actuarial, biostatistics and so on, under the assumption of independent <b>competing</b> <b>risks.</b> It is common that a failure is associated {{with one of the}} several competing failure modes. Previous studies have mostly considered the competing failure modes to be independent even when the interpretation of the failure modes implies dependency.

40|$|Abstract It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that patients enrolled in clinical trials frequently have a large degree of variation in their baseline risk for the outcome of interest. Thus, {{some have suggested that}} clinical trial results should routinely be stratified by outcome risk using risk models, since the summary results may otherwise be misleading. However, variation in <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> is another dimension of risk heterogeneity that may also underlie treatment effect heterogeneity. Understanding the effects of <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> heterogeneity may be especially important for pragmatic comparative effectiveness trials, which seek to include traditionally excluded patients, such as the elderly or complex patients with multiple comorbidities. Indeed, the observed effect of an intervention is dependent on the ratio of outcome risk to <b>competing</b> <b>risk,</b> and these risks – {{which may or may not}} be correlated – may vary considerably in patients enrolled in a trial. Further, the effects of <b>competing</b> <b>risk</b> on treatment effect heterogeneity can be amplified by even a small degree of treatment related harm. Stratification of trial results along both the competing and the outcome risk dimensions may be necessary if pragmatic comparative effectiveness trials are to provide the clinically useful information their advocates intend. </p...|$|E

This work first presents two new distributions which are well-suited for modeling <b>competing</b> <b>risks</b> data. In existing inference procedures for <b>competing</b> <b>risks</b> data, it appears that the correlation between failure time distributions of competing events are fixed as a constant. In the second part of this dissertation, a novel approach is proposed which allows researchers to model <b>competing</b> <b>risks</b> data by taking the correlation into account by estimating it.
