5|$|At {{the ends}} of the linear {{chromosomes}} are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres. The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase, as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot <b>copy</b> <b>the</b> extreme 3′ ends of chromosomes. These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the DNA repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected. In human cells, telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.|$|E

5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of World WarII, the SS had consolidated into its final form, which comprised three main organizations: the Allgemeine SS, SS-Totenkopfverbände, and the Waffen-SS, {{which was founded in}} 1934 as the SS-Verfügungstruppe (SS-VT) and renamed in 1940. The Waffen-SS evolved into a second German army alongside the Wehrmacht and operated in tandem with them, especially with the Heer (German Army). Although SS ranks generally had equivalents in the other services, the SS rank system did not <b>copy</b> <b>the</b> terms and ranks used by the Wehrmacht's branches. Instead it used the ranks established by the post-World War I Freikorps and the SA. This was primarily done to emphasize the SS as being independent from the Wehrmacht.|$|E

5|$|Cell {{division}} {{is essential for}} an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to <b>copy</b> <b>the</b> antiparallel strands of the double helix. In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.|$|E

5|$|Discussions {{over the}} sale of the Su-35 proved {{protracted}} due to concerns over intellectual property rights. Since China had reverse engineered the Su-27SK and Su-33 to create the J-11B and J-15, respectively, there were concerns that China would <b>copy</b> <b>the</b> airframe and offer the copied design on the export market. At one stage Rosoboronexport demanded that China provided a legally-binding guarantee against copying. However, industry sources believed that Chinese industry was interested in the AL-41FS1 engine and Irbis-E radar. According to The Diplomat, China was specifically interested in the engine of the Su-35, as the country was already test flying the J-11D. While the aircraft reportedly has less range, payload and manoeuvrability than the Su-35, the J-11D has an active electronically-scanned array radar, instead of the less-advanced PESA radar as found on the Su-35. Various reports have drawn attention to the need for Chinese industry to close the technological gap between its engine industry and those of the US, Europe and Russia.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the new millennium, {{president}} Joan Laporta, a supporter of Catalan nationalism, repeatedly expressed his support of Catalonia's secession from Spain and characterised the club as the symbol for Catalan separatism.

By 2003 Barcelona had 1,200 penyes around the world, causing other Spanish clubs to <b>copy</b> <b>the</b> concept. With each individual peña (Castillian Spanish spelling) having different names and rules, it has become a custom in Spain to name a new peña after their favourite player or match, and in turn the player usually attends to the inaugural supper.|$|E

Britain's Alvis-Staussler negotiated for a production license from September 1938 until March 1939 when the Nazi occupation made an agreement impossible. The Soviets were also interested so Škoda shipped the S-II-a prototype and one production LT vz. 35 to the proving grounds at Kubinka for evaluation. The Soviets were only interested in buying the prototype, but Škoda refused to sell unless a license was purchased as well, believing that the Soviets would simply <b>copy</b> <b>the</b> design and build it without paying any royalties.|$|E
