Presumably, {{many of the}} events were inspired by Barbauld's experiences of teaching her own adopted son, her nephew Charles, as the events correlate with his age and growth. Although there are no surviving first edition copies of the works, children's literature scholar Mitzi Myers has reconstructed the probable publication dates from Barbauld's letters and the books' earliest reviews as follows: Lessons for <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> two to three (1778); Lessons for <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> three, part I (1778); Lessons for <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> three, part II (1778); and Lessons for <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> three to four (1779).
