THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN <b>COMPUTER-ASSISTED</b> READING <b>INSTRUCTION,</b> COMPREHENSION AND LEARNING APPROACHES BY PUPILS IN THE SENIOR PRIMARY PHASE. The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was primarily to determine in which way, if any, the reading comprehension of learners with a surface and a deep learning approach, is influenced differently" by using a specific <b>computer-assisted</b> reading <b>instruction</b> programme. Secondly, it was established to which extent the programme influenced the reading ability of learners in the senior primary school phase as manifested in reading comprehension and word recognition, in comparison with classical reading instruction using exclusively printed text. As basis of the empirical research, Solomon's four group design was used. A standardised test was used to determine the reading comprehension of pupils who were used, and their learning approach was measured by means of an existing questionnaire which was adapted. Observations in {{the research}}, as well as quantitative results were qualitatively analysed and discussed. Several factors, however, obviated that a meaningful connection between <b>computer-assisted</b> reading <b>instruction</b> with the specific programme and the learners' learning approach, could not be found with absolute certainty. Meaningful correlations, however, were found in the reading comprehension achievement of learners with a surface approach, and who had received <b>computer-assisted</b> reading <b>instruction,</b> in comparison with the other groups in the experiment. Learners with a deep approach, who had received <b>computer-assisted</b> reading <b>instruction,</b> showed statistically meaningful improvement within the group as regards feelings and achievement. No statistically meaningful improvement in reading comprehension achievement took place in the group who received extra reading instruction without the use of a computer. Resulting from these findings, and on the basis of effective reading instruction, practice-orientated recommendations have been made as regards the use of <b>computer-assisted</b> reading <b>instruction</b> and learning approaches.

40|$|In this paper, {{high school}} {{mathematics}} teachers’ views on <b>computer-assisted</b> mathematics <b>instruction</b> and on computer algebra systems (CAS) were explored in two stages, {{before and after}} they were trained on it. This study {{is based on the}} case study model of the qualitative research method. Semi-structured interview forms constitute the data of the study. Some codes and themes were established with the descriptive and content analyses of the data. The results show that teachers had positive opinions about <b>computer-assisted</b> mathematics <b>instruction</b> before they were trained, yet a majority of them was not able to use it in their classes for several reasons. However, it is seen that none of the teachers except for one knew about computer algebra systems (CAS). It is understood after the training that all the teachers wanted to use <b>computer-assisted</b> mathematics <b>instruction</b> in their classes, and thus they needed to use Mathematica, which is a computer algebra system, during the process. Likewise, while most of the teachers did not want their students to interact with computers or tablets in their classes before the <b>computer-assisted</b> mathematics <b>instruction</b> training, almost all of them had a favorable opinion of it after the training...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} <b>computer-assisted</b> <b>instructions</b> and flight simulations to enhance procedural and perceptual motor task training. Attention is called {{to the fact that}} incorporating the accident and incident data contained in reports filed with the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) would be a valuable training tool which the learner could apply for other situations. The need to segment the events is emphasized; this would make it possible to modify events in order to suit the needs of the training environment. Methods were developed for designing meaningful scenario development on runway incursions on the basis of analysis of ASRS reports. It is noted that, while the development of interactive training tools using the ASRS and other data bases holds much promise, the design and production of interactive video programs and laser disks are very expensive. It is suggested that this problem may be overcome by sharing the costs of production to develop a library of materials available to a broad range of users...|$|R
