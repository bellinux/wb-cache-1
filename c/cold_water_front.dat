30|$|An {{important}} feature {{of the system is}} production temperatures staying above the initial values, meaning that the stored 90  °C water constantly keeps warming up the reservoir around the P 1 well. This means elevated energy production for the entire storage cycle. The slowing rate of increase indicates that the reservoir is approaching a steady, elevated temperature which is maintained by the annual storage phase and could potentially go on for decades, barring pressure increase above safety limits and potential interference from the <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>front.</b>|$|E

The model can beused to design the flow rates and location of injection wells in suchsystems. The results obtained using the model show that initially thecold water will move very rapidly through the fracture system away fromthe well. Later on, conductive heat transfer from the rock matrix blockswill retard the advancement of the <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>front,</b> and eventuallyuniform energy sweep conditions will prevail. Where uniform energy sweepconditions are reached the cold waer movement away from the injectionwell will be identical {{to that in a}} porous medium; consequently maximumenergy recovery from the rock matrix will be attained.

30|$|Reservoir {{temperature}} {{increase is}} minuscule after 3 cycles and production temperature settles around 76.4  °C, which is 1.5  °C {{higher than in}} the beginning. This ambient temperature is then maintained throughout the simulation {{until the end of the}} 10 th cycle. Based on these results, we can see no significant losses occurring in the reservoir, and the <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>front</b> from I 1 apparently has no effect on production temperature. Buoyancy flow does not seem to be a factor, most likely due to the small difference in reservoir and injection temperature. This suggests that the energy recovery might improve after several years of operation as was the case for Drijver et al. (2012). Compared to their findings of close to 20 % increase in recovery efficiency, however, our model only produces a mere 1 % more energy in the 10 th year of operation than in the first year.|$|E

40|$|We {{discussed}} the short-term fluctuations of the Tsushima Current, using ADCP (acoustic Doppler current profiler) data {{taken by the}} quadrireciprocal method (Katoh, 1988) for removing tidal currents from observed currents. Transects were set in waters northwest of Yamaguchi Prefecture to capture {{the first and second}} branches of the Tsushima Current. Along the transects, ADCP and STD (salinity-temperature-depth recorder) measurements were repeated in May to July 1989. The velocity of the first branch fluctuated considerably in a short period, while the direction and position of its axis were steady. The stability of its axis position probably results from the topographic β effect. The baroclinic transport, which is based on calculations of geostrophic current with assuming zero velocity near the bottom, of the first branch was almost equal to the barotropic one. The range of fluctuation in the barotropic transport was much larger than that in the baroclinic transport. The barotropic fluctuation was correlated with the difference in atmospheric pressure between the east and west sides of the Tsushima Strait. As for the second branch, not only the velocity but also the position of its axis changed noticeably in a short period. There was such a case where the axis was hardly recognized. The changeability of the axis position for the second branch seems to result from that of the <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>front.</b> The baroclinic transport of the second branch was much larger than the barotropic one, but the ranges of their fluctuations were very similar with each other. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{lifetime}} of geothermal projects mainly {{depends on the}} thermal breakthrough (thermal breakthrough occurs when a <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>front</b> reaches the producer). Currently, geothermal-energy production is marginally economical because of its uncertainties and risks associated with the subsurface such as lifetime, flow rate, temperature. Lifetime of a geothermal reservoir plays the most {{important role in the}} use of geothermal energy because it mainly determines whether or not geothermal-energy production is economically viable. Through optimization of the well positions from one or more geothermal doublets in a homogeneous or heterogeneous reservoir, the profitability of the project, which is largely dependent on the time of compositional breakthrough, temperature breakthrough and the rate of temperature decline, can be improved. This thesis studies optimization of the well positions such that the Net Present Value (NPV) of a project is maximized in a 2 D geothermal reservoir for the selected heterogeneity structure. For this purpose an automated, gradient-based optimization method is used. The approach is based on the concept to surround the wells, whose locations have to be optimized, by so-called pseudo-wells. The reservoir simulations are performed using the Finite Element Method in the program COMSOL Multiphysics 4. 2 a. The major features of the simulation results are discussed in detail. The compositional front moves faster than the thermal front (the ratio of these two is the thermal retardation factor). Breakthrough of water with altered composition will therefore occur at an early stage in the doublet lifetime. Reservoir heterogeneities influence the time at which thermal and compositional breakthrough occur and also determine the rate at which temperature and composition decline after breakthrough. The temperature and compositional decline curves after breakthrough are generally steeper in a homogeneous reservoir than in a heterogeneous reservoir. Therefore, the thermal breakthrough does not necessarily mean the end of the {{lifetime of}} a doublet. It is also shown that the effect of heterogeneities on the thermal retardation factor is small. Three successful optimization sequences in two different reservoirs are described in this thesis. It is shown that, from an economical standpoint, is makes little sense to assume a doublet lifetime of more than 30 years. Furthermore, the effectiveness at which a geothermal doublet is able to deplete a reservoir (recovery factor) and profitability of a geothermal doublet are closely interlinked. However, a higher recovery factor {{does not necessarily mean that}} the doublet is more profitable and vice versa. There exists an optimum well spacing for doublets positioned in homogeneous reservoirs, such that additional gain of later breakthrough (when placing the production well further away from the injector) is negated by the loss in pressure support of the injection well. This optimum well spacing is found to be an important factor, influencing the profitability in homogeneous and heterogeneous reservoirs. In addition, it is found that the optimum well spacing of a doublet for greenhouse heating is the same as the optimum well spacing of a doublet for spatial heating. The heat production from an aquifer can be maximized through the usage of multiple doublet layouts. It is found that, even in a heterogeneous reservoir, it is best to use a checkers-board well arrangement, which is more effective than a tramrail well arrangement.

Further, by the help of these methods we have succeeded in solving important problems which {{would otherwise have been}} insoluable by only using the material obtained from the cruises. An example has been described above as to how the distribution of air pressure well in advance, can influence the herring fishery along the west coast.

By maintaining two permanent oceanographic stations in the spring herring fishery district, one off Egersund and one off Bømlo, we will together with the oceanographic observations taken by the Flødevigen Hatchery near Arendal, the permanent station on the Sognesjø, and the temperature registrations taken on the line steamers, have at our disposal material that will allow of our being able to follow the movements of the front fairly well, and also decide the thickness of the penetrating watermass.
