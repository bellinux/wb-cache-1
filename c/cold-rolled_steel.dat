The latter are almost universally called [...] "barrels" [...] in {{preference}} to drums in the United States. They cannot efficaciously either dispense or be filled with powdered goods, though they might store them very well, so are not used for such goods, being reserved for liquids transport and storage. Plastic drums are manufactured using injection blow moulding technology and have either a separate lid (similar to those on fiber drums) or a welded type top with the bung holes molded in. Metal drums are manufactured with <b>cold-rolled</b> <b>steel</b> sheets, welded themselves into long pipe-like sections then forged on a stamping press into drum bodies. A rolled seam is then made for the drum bottom, or bottom and top both.|$|E
50|$|Cold-formed steel (CFS) is {{the common}} term for {{products}} made by rolling or pressing steel into semi-finished or finished goods at relatively low temperatures (cold working). Cold-formed steel goods are created by the working of steel billet, bar, or sheet using stamping, rolling (including roll forming), or presses to deform it into a usable product. Cold-worked steel products, such as <b>cold-rolled</b> <b>steel</b> (CRS) bar stock and sheet, are commonly used {{in all areas of}} manufacturing of durable goods, such as appliances or automobiles, but the phrase cold-formed steel is most prevalently used to describe construction materials. The use of cold-formed steel construction materials has become more and more popular since its initial introduction of codified standards in 1946. In the construction industry both structural and non-structural elements are created from thin gauges of sheet steel. These building materials encompass columns, beams, joists, studs, floor decking, built-up sections and other components. Cold-formed steel construction materials differ from other steel construction materials known as hot-rolled steel (see structural steel). The manufacturing of cold-formed steel products occurs at room temperature using rolling or pressing. The strength of elements used for design is usually governed by buckling. The construction practices are more similar to timber framing using screws to assemble stud frames.|$|E

The diffraction data were analyzed using the Rietveld structure refinement method. The analysis shows that for all specimens, the martensite particles are closely in compression and the austenite matrix is in tension. Both the martensite and austenite, for a sample reducing 34 % in thickness (containing of about 1 % martensite phase) the average lattice strains are anisotropic and decrease approximately exponential with an increase in the corresponding percent reduction (essentially phase content). It is shown that this feature can be qualitatively understood by taking into consideration the thermal expansion mismatch between the martensite and austenite grains. Also, for all <b>cold-rolled</b> stainless <b>steel</b> specimens, the diffraction peaks are broader than the unrolled one (instrumental resolution), indicating that the strains in these specimens are inhomogeneous. From an analysis of the refined peak shape parameters, the average root-mean square strain, which describes the distribution of the inhomogeneous strain field, was predicted. The average residual stresses in <b>cold-rolled</b> 304 stainless <b>steel</b> plates showed a combination effect of hydrostatic stresses of the martensite particles and the austenite matrix...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} the problem of shape (or flat-ness) control for Sendzimir 20 -roll <b>cold-rolling</b> <b>steel</b> mills. Such mills, with a variety of shape actuators, offer the control {{engineer}} considerable choice in the configuration and design of a shape con-trol system. In addition, the Sendzimir mill is a reversing mill, with shape measurement devices {{at either end of the}} mill, providing a facility for feedforward of incoming shape disturbances. The mul-tivariable problem presented by the mill has a significant singu-larity problem, which is tackled in this paper using a variety of ap-proaches, motivated by both practical (operational) considerations and formal theoretical procedures. A final challenge lies in the de-sire to economize on the number of controllers required to cover the mill over its wide range of operating conditions. The paper compares and contrasts various controller possibilities and is in-tended to provide a “cookbook ” of shape control tools and strate-gies for Sendzimir mills.
