5|$|The pig-faced women {{exhibited}} at fairs were not genuine. Showmen would drug a bear into a stupor by feeding it {{large amounts of}} strong beer, and then shave it. Once shaved, the drunken bear would be fitted with padded artificial breasts, and dressed in women's clothing and a wig. Shoes would {{be attached to the}} bear's hind paws, and stuffed gloves to the front paws. The bear would then be placed in a <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hole in the back, and securely tied to the chair.|$|E
5|$|Anne was crowned on St George's Day, 23 April 1702. Afflicted with gout, she {{was carried}} to Westminster Abbey {{in an open}} sedan <b>chair,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> low back to permit her train to flow out behind her. On 4 May, England became embroiled in the War of the Spanish Succession, in which England, Austria and the Dutch Republic fought against France and Spain. Charles II of Spain had died childless in 1700, and the {{succession}} was disputed by two claimants: the Habsburg Archduke Charles of Austria and the Bourbon Philip, Duke of Anjou.|$|E
5|$|The cover art for Perfectionist, which depicts Kills {{sitting on}} an exam <b>chair,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> red cross {{covering}} her eyes, was unveiled by Cherrytree on 11 March 2011. In Austria, Germany and Switzerland, {{the album was}} released by Universal Music as a CD and digital download {{on the first day}} of April, while in Poland it was issued on 14 April. The American release proceeded on 16 August, as well as for Canada. That day, Kills performed songs from the album at the New York City-based building Atlas, accompanied by a keyboardist. On 19 September, it was released in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The family disapproves of {{his first}} few inventions, {{including}} a make-up shotgun, electric hammer, alarm that never stops beeping, and reclining <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> built-in toilet, making Homer more depressed. However, they like one particular invention, a chair with two hinged legs on the back, {{making it impossible to}} tip over backwards. Homer is encouraged until he notices his poster of Edison shows him sitting in the same type of chair. Bart points out that the chair is not featured on a list of Edison's inventions, meaning he never told anyone of this invention.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} {{cinematic}} black bars expanding {{to reveal the}} scenery, which {{is set in a}} beach. Individual takes of the girls are shown momentarily as Dinah sings the chorus. The camera shifts to Fetty Wap, who is sitting down in a <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> guitar next to him. As he sings, the girls are seen dancing in the water, with Lauren kicking the water as the video goes into a slow-motion take for less than a second. Several of the scenes include Normani alone in a rock cliff, a close-up of Dinah singing and a shot of the girls together near the water.|$|E
5|$|Morsell {{found it}} {{challenging}} to film a scene {{near the end}} of the game, in which Adrienne is pleading with Don while getting strapped into the <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> guillotine overhead. Several different versions of the scene had to be filmed, and Morsell said it was difficult for her to work up the genuine emotion she needed take after take. The torture devices featured in the game were scale models made by local craftsmen. During one scene, the mansion roof starts to collapse, causing beams and chunks of debris to fall around the actors. To achieve this, the crew built lightweight beams out of hollow cardboard, which had to fall in the correct sequence. In another scene, Adrienne crawls along a water pipe that breaks. To film the scene without damaging equipment, the crew built a giant plastic box with a plastic tray underneath for the shoot. Three hoses ran through the pipe so water would spray in multiple directions.|$|E

However, Jones's son Stephan believes his father may have directed someone else to shoot him. An autopsy of Jones's body also showed levels of the barbiturate Pentobarbital, {{which may have been}} lethal to humans who had not developed physiological tolerance.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} an Escape section, {{the player}} {{needs to take}} a stance in a moral decision; one such decision involves one character being locked into a <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gun next to it and another character inside an incinerator. To stop the incinerator, the player needs to choose to pull the trigger, which has a 50% possibility of firing a live bullet, killing the character in the chair. The way the decisions are made varies: some involve choosing between options, and some have the player input their own answer.|$|E
25|$|As a consequence, certain traditions {{stated that}} popes {{throughout}} the medieval period {{were required to}} undergo a procedure wherein they sat on a special <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hole in the seat. A cardinal would have the task of putting his hand up the hole to check whether the pope had testicles, or doing a visual examination. This procedure is not taken seriously by most historians, {{and there is no}} documented instance. It is probably a scurrilous legend based on the existence of two ancient stone chairs with holes in the seats that probably dated from Roman times and may have been used because of their ancient imperial origins. Their original purpose is obscure.|$|E

25|$|On July 27, 2004, American cable {{television}} network TV Land unveiled a life-sized statue of Newhart on the Magnificent Mile {{in his native}} Chicago, depicting Dr. Robert Hartley from The Bob Newhart Show. The statue depicts Dr. Hartley sitting in his therapy practice <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pencil held between his hands, and a patients' sofa next to him. After an initial temporary installation in front of 430 North Michigan Avenue, the building used for exterior establishing shots of Hartley's office, the bronze set is now permanently located in the sculpture park in front of Chicago's Navy Pier entertainment complex. Visitors routinely {{sit on the couch}} and pose for photographs as Bob's patients.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} woman in a fine white and blue satin dress with gold trimmings. She sits on a platform a step higher than the black and white marble floor, her right foot on a terrestrial globe and her right hand on her heart as she looks up, adoringly, at a glass sphere hung from the ceiling by a blue ribbon. Her left arm rests {{on the edge of a}} table which holds a golden chalice, a large book, and a dark-wood crucifix. Behind the crucifix is a gilt-leather panel screen. Beneath the book is a long piece of cloth, possibly a priest's stole. Resting on top of the book is a crown of thorns. All of these items are on the platform, which is covered by a green and yellow rug, the edge of which is on the floor. At the bottom of the picture, nearer the viewer, is an apple, and nearer still a snake which has been squashed by a cornerstone. On the dim, far wall behind the woman, a large painting of Christ's crucifixion is hung on the wall behind the woman. To the viewer's left is a multicolored tapestry, pulled back at the bottom and seemingly the closest thing in the painting to the viewer. A <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> blue cloth on it is immediately beneath and behind the tapestry and to the left of the snake and cornerstone.|$|E

However one Cerambyx beetle was up to 3 inches (7.5cm) long, with antennae up to 5 inches (12.5cm) in length. He is amused at himself for finding his simple hut comfortable, once {{he has made a}} rough table and is in his rattan <b>chair,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mosquito net and [...] "large Scotch plaid" [...] to form a [...] "little sleeping apartment". He gets 17 new (at least for the Moluccas) species of bird including a new Pitta bird.|$|E

The throne is a <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{footstool}} (more akin to its European counterparts) with two high tables to its sides. The throne is topped by another Royal Nine-tiered Umbrella. This throne is used during {{the main part of the}} coronation ceremony, where the King is presented with the various objects, which make up the Royal Regalia. The king will crown himself, then be ceremonially presented with the objects of the regalia by the Royal Brahmins. These include: the Great Crown of Victory, the Sword of Victory, the Royal Staff, the Royal Flywisk, the Royal Fan and the Royal Slippers.|$|E

500|$|Gardner was {{executed}} on June 18, 2010, at 12:15am Mountain Daylight Time by a firing squad at Utah State Prison in Draper. He {{was placed in}} restraints on a black metal <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hood covering his head. Sandbags were arranged around him to absorb ricochets. The firing squad {{was made up of}} five anonymous volunteers who were certified police officers. The officers stood about [...] from Gardner, aiming at a white target positioned over his heart. One of their [...]30-caliber Winchester rifles was selected at random and loaded with a non-lethal wax bullet so that they would not know with certainty who fired the fatal shots. According to the Utah Department of Corrections, the squad used a countdown cadence beginning with five and simultaneously firing right before two. His dark blue jumpsuit made it difficult to see the blood from his wounds. A medical examiner removed Gardner's hood to reveal his lifeless face. After verifying Gardner's lack of pulse at the neck and pupillary light reflex, the medical examiner pronounced him dead at 12:17am. He {{was the first person to}} be executed by firing squad in the United States since the execution of John Albert Taylor 14 years earlier. A commemorative coin was commissioned for prison staff who participated in the execution.|$|E

500|$|During {{the second}} verse, a mad scientist, portrayed by Kinney, {{seemingly}} tortures Gaga, who {{is wearing a}} yellow dress with glasses made of barbwire, as another version of the singer, with teal-colored hair, performs a dance routine with her backup dancers in a barn. As the chorus begins for the second time, Gaga appears as Yüyi the Mermaid, with gills {{on her face and}} neck, as she lies in a tub filled with dirty water. At the end of the chorus, the camera zooms to a brunette Gaga inside a water tank while she sings [...] "You and I" [...] in the desert scene, and in the cornfield with Calderone. Interspersing scenes again show Gaga having her wedding, Yüyi in her tub, and Gaga seated on a <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> conveyor belt. During May's guitar solo, Gaga dances in the cornfield with other dancers dressed in the same white dress, as Yüyi and the scientist kiss. While singing the chorus for the final time, Gaga kisses Calderone in one sequence and runs across the field in another. As the video reaches its conclusion, the tortured Gaga is being slid down as the conveyor belt turns on. The video ends with Yüyi and the scientist together in the bath tub, as a depiction of their dream wedding flashes across, before a last shot of the barn as the screen turns black.|$|E
500|$|Jackson had {{a troubled}} {{relationship}} with his father. In 2003, Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped him as a boy. Joe was also said to have verbally abused his son, often {{saying that he had}} a [...] "fat nose". Jackson stated that he was physically and emotionally abused during incessant rehearsals, though he credited his father's strict discipline with playing a large role in his success. In an interview with Martin Bashir for the 2003 documentary Living with Michael Jackson, Jackson recalled that Joe often sat in a <b>chair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, and that [...] "if you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, really get you." [...] Jackson's parents have disputed the longstanding allegations of abuse, with Katherine stating that while whipping is considered abuse today, it was a common way to discipline children at the time. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have also said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. Speaking openly about his childhood in an interview with Oprah Winfrey broadcast in February 1993, Jackson acknowledged that his youth had been lonely and isolating. His deep dissatisfaction with his appearance, his nightmares and chronic sleep problems, his tendency to remain hyper-compliant, especially with his father, and to remain childlike in adulthood are consistent with the effects of the maltreatment he endured as a child.|$|E
