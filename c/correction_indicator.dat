Period from 2015 till present:In May 2015 the President {{introduced}} “Plan of the Nation - 100 Concrete Steps of Implementation of Five Institutional Reforms of the Head of State”, {{which had}} an impact on the civil service too. The purpose of this plan is to accept the global internal challenges and to enter the top-30 most developed countries in the world. One of the five institutional reforms is “formation of contemporary state apparatus”, which is directly about civil service system of Kazakhstan. This chapter includes 15 innovations or steps (out of 100 steps of the plan) in civil service. In fact it covers all aspects that were introduced in the previous phases (Reference: Plan of the nation, Chapter 1): 1) Admission to the civil service must begin from the lower positions.2) Selection of candidates to lower positions and further career promotion must be implemented on the basis of the competence approach.3) Centralization of the selection procedure of the applicants joining the civil service for the first time. It should be implemented through the strengthening the role of the Ministry of Civil Service Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Introduction of the three-tier selection system. 4) Mandatory probationary period for new employees in the civil service according to the formula 3+3 (evaluation of appropriateness in three months and six months respectively. 5) Increase of the salary of civil servants depending on their performance results. 6) Transition to the payment according to results: for civil servants, public bodies, ministries and akims, members of the Government. 7) Introduction of the regional <b>correction</b> <b>indicators</b> to the basic salary of civil servants.8) Mandatory provision of on-duty accommodation without the right for privatization for rotated civil servants for the period of performance of official duties.9) Legislative consolidation of the system of regular training for civil servants at least once every three years. 10) Transition to the competitive selection for career promotion of civil servants. Strengthening the principle of meritocracy. 11) Allowance of foreign managers, individual specialists from private sector and citizens of the Republic of Kazakhstan - employees of the international organizations to the work of civil service. Their appointment can be implemented by specific requirements and separate list of positions. This step makes civil service open and competitive system. 12) Introduction of new ethical rules. Design of new Code of ethics of civil service. Introduction of the position responsible for the issues of ethics. 13) Strengthening the fight against corruption, including the development of new legislation. Creation of specialized department for systematic prevention of corruption offenses. 14) Adoption of new Law on civil service15) Conduction of a comprehensive attestation of the current civil servants after the adoption of new law on civil service.|$|R

This study aimed to analyse {{the influence of the}} age distribution on the ranking of small areas by socioeconomic status and on the association between their socioeconomic status and standardised mortality. DESIGN [...] The ranking of small areas by socioeconomic status indicators (educational level, income, and unemployment) was compared with crude values and after correction for their age structure. The age and gender standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) of these areas for the age group 1 - 64 years was then rank correlated with both crude and age standardised measures {{of socioeconomic}} status. SETTING [...] This study used data for all (n = 22) boroughs of Amsterdam for the period 1986 - 91. MAIN RESULTS [...] <b>Correction</b> of <b>indicators</b> of socioeconomic status for the age structure of the population hardly affects the ranking of Amsterdam boroughs by socioeconomic status. All rank correlations between crude and age standardised socioeconomic status measures are above 0. 95. Rank correlations between SMR and these socioeconomic status measures also hardly change after correction for the age structure of boroughs except for education. Mean income per earner is the socioeconomic status indicator most strongly associated with the SMR. CONCLUSIONS [...] This study shows that the age structure of Amsterdam boroughs has almost no influence on their ranking by socioeconomic status and a limited influence on the association between their socioeconomic status and SMR, except for educational level. The latter indicator has the strongest association with age. This result and theoretical considerations indicate that a correction for the age structure of the population will be more important if small areas differ little with regard to socioeconomic status, if they vary considerably in age structure, or if a given indicator of socioeconomic status shows a strong cohort effect or age association...|$|R

40|$|Seafloor {{segmentation}} and characterization {{based on}} local textural properties of acoustic backscatter {{has been a}} subject of research since 1980 s due to the highly textured appearance of sonar images. The approach consists of subdivision of sonar image {{in a set of}} patches of certain size and calculation of a vector of features reflecting the patch texture. Advance of multibeam echosounders (MBES) allowed application of texture-based techniques to real geographical space, and predicted boundaries between acoustic facies became experimentally verifiable. However, acoustic return from uncalibrated MBES produces artifacts in backscatter mosaics, which in turn affects accuracy of delineation. Development of Geocoder allowed creation of more visually consistent images, and reduced the number of factors influencing mosaic creation. It is intuitively clear that more accurate backscatter mosaics lead to more reliable classification results. However, this statement has never been thoroughly verified. It has not been investigated which corrections are important for texture-based characterization and which are not essential. In this paper the authors are investigating the Stanton Banks common dataset. Raw data files from the dataset have been processed by the Geocoder at different levels of corrections. Each processing resulted in a backscatter mosaic demonstrating artifacts of different levels of severity. Mosaics then underwent textural analysis and unsupervised classification using Matlab package SonarClass. Results of seafloor characterization corresponding to varying levels of corrections were finally compared to the one generated by the best possible mosaic (the one embodying all the available <b>corrections),</b> providing an <b>indicator</b> of classification accuracy and giving guidance about which mosaic corrections are crucial for acoustic classification and which could be safely ignored...|$|R
40|$|In {{climate change}} impact research, the {{assessment}} of future river runoff {{as well as the}} catchment scale water balance is impeded by different sources of modeling uncertainty. Some research has already been done in order to quantify the uncertainty of climate 5 projections originating from the climate models and the downscaling techniques {{as well as from the}} internal variability evaluated from climate model member ensembles. Yet, the use of hydrological models adds another layer of incertitude. Within the QBic 3 project (Qu´ebec-Bavaria International Collaboration on Climate Change) the relative contributions to the overall uncertainty from the whole model chain (from global climate 10 models to water management models) are investigated using an ensemble of multiple climate and hydrological models. Although there are many options to downscale global climate projections to the regional scale, recent impact studies tend to use Regional Climate Models (RCMs). One reason for that is that the physical coherence between atmospheric and land-surface 15 variables is preserved. The coherence between temperature and precipitation is of particular interest in hydrology. However, the regional climate model outputs often are biased compared to the observed climatology of a given region. Therefore, biases in those outputs are often corrected to reproduce historic runoff conditions from hydrological models using them, even if those corrections alter the relationship between temperature and precipitation. So, as bias correction may affect the consistency between RCM output variables, the use of correction techniques and even the use of (biased) climate model data itself is sometimes disputed among scientists. For those reasons, the effect of bias correction on simulated runoff regimes and the relative change in selected runoff indicators is explored. If it affects the conclusion of climate change analysis in 25 hydrology, we should consider it as a source of uncertainty. If not, the application of bias correction methods is either unnecessary in hydro-climatic projections, or safe to use as it does not alter the change signal of river runoff. The results of the present paper highlight the analysis of daily runoff simulated with four different hydrological models in two natural-flow catchments, driven by different regional climate models for a reference and a future period. As expected, bias correction of climate model outputs is important for the reproduction of the runoff regime of the 5 past regardless of the hydrological model used. Then again, its impact on the relative change of flow indicators between reference and future period is weak for most indicators with the exception of the timing of the spring flood peak. Still, our results indicate that the impact of bias <b>correction</b> on runoff <b>indicators</b> increases with bias in the climate simulations. ...|$|R

40|$|Background. Though many Russian {{and foreign}} {{studies have been}} devoted {{to the study of}} {{self-control}} in educational activity, most of the research has been limited to the use of questionnaires or psychodiagnostic methods. The neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the process of cognitive control in the context of learning have still not been sufficiently understood, despite the obvious significance of controlling action for academic success. Objective. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the psychological and neurophysiological features of cognitive control in the process of learning activity, for students with different levels of academic success. Design. This study investigates the control function in first-year students who have varying degrees of academic success. The research design is interdisciplinary and integrates three different approaches: the neurophysiological, psychological, and pedagogical. In the empirical part, 31 first-year students at Saint Petersburg State University (SPbSU) participated in the research. We measured the personal characteristics of the subjects (using the five-factor personality questionnaire as modified by A. B. Khromov), their self-management ability (Peysakhov’s SMA test), characteristics of the event-related potentials of the brain in response to presentation of stimuli in the solving of problems that require searching for an error in a word (electroencephalographic method), response time, and number of errors and corrections. Four types of stimuli were used: the correct spelling of a word, the replacement of a letter with one that is written similarly or sounds similar, or by one that is not similar. The indicators used to measure academic success were the results of the Unified State Examination (USE) and the first (winter) term of the 2016 – 17 academic year. The data were analyzed by correlation analysis and analysis of variance. Results. Comparison of groups of students with lower and higher levels of academic success showed significant differences in all the measured groups of variables — personality traits (Emotionality–Restraint factor), components of the system of self-management (Goal-Setting and Forecasting scales), behavioral data from the experiment (number of <b>corrections),</b> and neurophysiological <b>indicators</b> of cognitive control (the components P 200, N 200, P 300, and N 400). The results of the study revealed that students with greater academic success are characterized by less emotionality, a higher capability for goal-setting, and a lower capability for forecasting, as well as greater attention and greater engagement in solving the task of finding mistakes. Such students flexibly distribute their efforts depending on the difficulty of the task and are less likely than the less successful students to change their initial answer to the experimental task. Conclusion. A high level of development of the self-regulation and self-management system potentially improves the process of finding an error which is necessary for better academic success...|$|R
