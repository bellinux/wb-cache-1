50|$|It is a cake {{filled with}} cake crumbs, nougat {{chocolate}}, apricot jam and then soaked with rum. The cake is <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> 1-1/2 <b>inch</b> square cubes, covered with so called Punschglasur (punch icing), a thick pink rum sugar glazing often drizzled with chocolate and a cocktail cherry on top. Nowadays, {{there are also}} Punschkrapfen in cylindrical form.|$|R
50|$|Pork {{tenderloin}} is <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> 1 <b>inch</b> {{slices and}} pounded with mallet {{until it becomes}} thinner and soft. Eggs and spices are combined on a separate plate and lightly beaten. The meat is dipped in flour, then in egg, and then covered in breadcrumbs. The oil is heated in a frying pan till it starts to sizzle and the meat is placed onto it, then turned {{over a couple of}} times. Served hot. Kotlet schabowy can be served with cooked potatoes, mashed potatoes, fried mushrooms, cooked vegetables (seared cabbage), with salads or with coleslaw.|$|R
60|$|Who betrayed William Wallace in the end, is {{not quite}} certain. That he was betrayed--probably by an attendant--is too true. He {{was taken to the}} Castle of Dumbarton, under SIR JOHN MENTEITH, and thence to London, where the great fame of his bravery and {{resolution}} attracted immense concourses of people to behold him. He was tried in Westminster Hall, with a crown of laurel on his head--it is supposed because he was reported to have said that he ought to wear, or that he would wear, a crown there and was found guilty as a robber, a murderer, and a traitor. What they called a robber (he said to those who tried him) he was, because he had taken spoil from the King's men. What they called a murderer, he was, because he had slain an insolent Englishman. What they called a traitor, he was not, for he had never sworn allegiance to the King, and had ever scorned to do it. He was dragged at the tails of horses to West Smithfield, and there hanged on a high gallows, torn open before he was dead, beheaded, and quartered. His head was set upon a pole on London Bridge, his right arm was sent to Newcastle, his left arm to Berwick, his legs to Perth and Aberdeen. But, if King Edward had had his body <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>inches,</b> and had sent every separate <b>inch</b> <b>into</b> a separate town, he could not have dispersed it half so far and wide as his fame. Wallace will be remembered in songs and stories, while there are songs and stories in the English tongue, and Scotland will hold him dear while her lakes and mountains last.|$|R
50|$|Ridgway {{published}} Color Standards and Color Nomenclature {{himself in}} 1912, financed {{in part by}} a loan from his friend and colleague Zeledón. The work became a standard reference used by ornithologists for decades after Ridgway's death, as well as specialists in such wide-ranging fields as mycology, philately, and food coloring. The book named 1,115 colors, illustrated with painted samples reproduced on 53 plates. Special care was taken to ensure consistency of color reproduction across the edition, as well as the prevention of fading. The color samples were printed as large sheets by A. Hoen & Co., <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> swatches one <b>inch</b> by one-and-one-half <b>inches,</b> and pasted <b>into</b> each bound book.|$|R
25|$|Given the {{versatility}} of both vegetables, {{they were}} usually boiled or steamed, and eaten by itself or as ingredients in soups and strews. Without {{the need for}} advanced agricultural technology, taro and sweet potatoes were a prime preference for farming. Canadian missionary George MacKay said of 19th century Taiwan: ‘the bulb of the sweet potato is planted in March. In about six weeks the vines are <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> pieces eight <b>inches</b> long, which are planted in drills, and from these vine-cuttings the bulbs grow and are ripe {{about the end of}} June. A second crop is planted in a similar way in July and is ripe in November.’ (Ibid). The influence of sweet potatoes and taro has been vast. They are still widely present in modern-day Taiwan, be it on the streets, night markets, or in successful food chains like ‘Meet Fresh’ (or 鮮芋仙).|$|R
5000|$|Doron Plate is {{a strong}} fiberglass-based {{laminate}} that was first used by the United States military as personal body armor for infantry in the Battle of Okinawa in 1945. The plates were approximately [...] <b>inch</b> thick and <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> five <b>inch</b> squares then inserted into pockets on a nylon vest that covered {{the front and back}} portions of the torso as well as the shoulders. The vest weighed approximately 8 pounds. The plates consist of fiberglass filaments bonded together with resin under pressure. The plates could be molded to fit the contours of the chest or back. Dow Company discovered the technology for the doron plate in May 1943 because a shortage of metal during World War II had stimulated research into non-metallic forms of body armor. The doron plate could not stop direct fire from bullets but was effective at stopping relatively slow moving flak and shrapnel. The plates were named after General G. F. Doriot who was chief of the Research and Development Branch, Office of the Quartermaster General of the Army during World War II. The doron plates were used in the Korean War in the M-1951 and T-52-2 vests and the Vietnam War in the M-1952 and M-1955 vests. Stronger and lighter materials such as Kevlar-based body armor eventually superseded the doron plate.|$|R
50|$|The {{process for}} making the {{americium}} used in the buttons on ionization-type smoke detectors begins with americium dioxide. The AmO2 is thoroughly mixed with gold, shaped into a briquette, and fused by pressure and heat at over 1470°F (800°C). A backing of silver and a front covering of gold (or an alloy of gold or palladium) are applied to the briquette and sealed by hot forging. The briquette is then processed through several stages of cold rolling to achieve the desired thickness and levels of radiation emission. The final thickness is about 0.008 inches (0.2 mm), with the gold cover representing about {{one percent of the}} thickness. The resulting foil strip, which is about 0.8 inches (20 mm) wide, is <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> sections 39 <b>inches</b> (1 meter) long. The sources are punched out of the foil strip. Each disc, about 0.2 inches (5 mm) in diameter, is mounted in a metal holder, usually made of aluminium. The holder is the housing, which is the majority of what is seen on the button. The thin rim on the holder is rolled over to completely seal the cut edge around the disc.|$|R
50|$|For {{short-range}} weapons, each warrior's sword {{was tested}} against ballistics gel torsos. The ninjato {{was able to}} <b>cut</b> six <b>inches</b> <b>into</b> the shoulder, lacerating the arm's blood vessels and the lung, and causing death by bleed-out {{within a matter of}} seconds. The velocity of the ninjato was measured and while the results were not specifically stated on the show, it was stated that the ninjato's velocity surpassed that of the Spartan's dory spear. The Spartan xiphos short sword was thrust six or seven <b>inches</b> <b>into</b> the torso just below the ribcage, but hit the metal rod supporting the torso with enough force to bend the sword, preventing an accurate reading, but according to Spartan expert Barry Jacobsen, it would have severed a real spinal cord. It was also explained in the Ninja/Spartan episode of the Aftermath that the blow had already severed the main aorta, cause rapid death. Both weapons were also tested on pig carcasses. The ninjato was able to cut clean through the pig in two slices (cutting through the pelvis and the spine) as well as the short sword. The edge was given to the ninjato due to its power, lightness, superior range, and quickness.|$|R

50|$|To {{make the}} filling for bindae-tteok, soaked bracken is <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> short pieces, mixed with ground pork, and {{seasoned}} with soy sauce, chopped scallions, minced garlic, ground black pepper, and sesame oil. Mung bean sprouts are washed, blanched, <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> short pieces and seasoned {{with salt and}} sesame oil. Kimchi is unstuffed and squeezed to remove its fillings and excess juice, then <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> small pieces. The ingredients are then mixed.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from being}} a staple-food, millet was always {{produced}} as wine. Not just for drinking, millet wine {{played an important role}} in being used as offerings during festivals, births and weddings. Millet wines are all made in the homes of the Aborigines. Sticky rice is put into a wooden steamer after being soaked in water. Once cooled, the rice is put into a pot of water, then pulled out and combined with rice yeast. After four or five days of being placed in a large jar, the rice is placed in a sieve or rice bag, whilst the alcoholic liquid drips out and is stored away. Also important to the Indigenous Taiwanese people’s cuisine are the sweet potato and taro, favoured for their perennial nature and low maintenance. The cultivation of root vegetables rather than typical seedling plants was notably prominent, with archaeological evidence suggesting as early as fourth millennium BC, from the Dapenkeng site, in Guanyin Mountain, New Taipei City. Given the versatility of both vegetables, they were usually boiled or steamed, and eaten by itself or as ingredients in soups and strews. Without the need for advanced agricultural technology, taro and sweet potatoes were a prime preference for farming. Canadian missionary George MacKay said of 19th century Taiwan: ‘the bulb of the sweet potato is planted in March.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a generalized cake-cutting problem {{in which we}} seek to divide multiple cakes so that two players may get their most-preferred piece selections: a choice of one piece from each cake, allowing {{for the possibility of}} linked preferences over the cakes. For two players, we show that disjoint envy-free piece selections may not exist for two cakes <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> two pieces each, and they may not exist for three cakes <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> three pieces each. However, there do exist such divisions for two cakes <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> three pieces each, and for three cakes <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> four pieces each. The resulting allocations of pieces to players are Pareto-optimal with respect to the division. We use a generalization of Sperner’s lemma on the polytope of divisions to locate solutions to our generalized cake-cutting problem...|$|R
