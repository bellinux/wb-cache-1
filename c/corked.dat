25|$|In 2010, Deadspin {{reported}} Rose used <b>corked</b> bats {{during his}} 1985 pursuit of Cobb's record.

25|$|When Dusty Baker, the Cub {{manager was}} interviewed later, he stated any use of <b>corked</b> bats {{on his team}} is {{strictly}} prohibited. On June 6, Sosa was suspended for eight games. However, the suspension was reduced to seven games after appeal on June 11. Sosa finished the season with 40 home runs, and he hit two more in the 2003 NLCS against the Florida Marlins, which the Cubs led 3 games to 1 before ultimately falling in seven games.|$|E
25|$|At {{seven points}} {{along the length of}} the boat, {{thickness}} gauges were cut, usually at the bottom of the boat. Those holes were bored from outside the log after the outside of the boat was formed. The depth of the holes equated to the required thickness of the boat bottom. In the Hasholme logboat, however, the thickness gauges were bored not at the bottom but at the turn of the bilge, and later <b>corked</b> by oak tree-nails.|$|E

25|$|Following the Wallabies first Test defeat, the Australian team {{management}} planned to move Campese to the fullback {{position for the}} second Test, replacing Andrew Leeds. However, Australian flyhalf Michael Lynagh injured himself with a badly <b>corked</b> thigh {{in the second half}} of Queensland's 12-27 loss to the All Blacks, leaving Australia without a recognised goal-kicker. Randwick player Lloyd Walker was then selected at flyhalf, Leeds was reinstated at fullback so Australia could have a goal-kicker to replace Lynagh, and Campese moved back to the left-wing position.|$|E

This marked the earliest exit from a finals series by a team that Franklin has played in (excluding 2015, when he missed the finals series) since 2010.

2500|$|In , the Cubs won the National League Central Division title. The {{year was}} not all good news for Sosa, however. In May, he spent his first period on the {{disabled}} list since [...] after having an injured toenail removed. On June 3, 2003, Sosa was ejected from a Chicago Cubs-Tampa Bay Devil Rays game in the first inning when umpires discovered he had been using a <b>corked</b> bat. [...] Major League Baseball confiscated and tested 76 of Sosa's other bats after his ejection; all were found to be clean, with no cork. Five bats he had sent to the Hall of Fame in past years were also tested, and were all clean as well. Sosa stated that he had accidentally used the <b>corked</b> bat, which he claimed he only used during batting practice.|$|E

The pressure in the bottle forces out the ice containing the lees, and the bottle is quickly <b>corked</b> to maintain the carbon dioxide in solution.

Belle later moved to the White Sox in 1997, making the rivalry even more intense.|$|E

In 1999, he had a mild asthma attack while warming up for a game against Melbourne, then fainted while at a restaurant after the game. West Coast's football manager, Rod Lester-Smith, said Cousins may have been affected by asthma, low blood pressure from playing the game earlier, and a <b>corked</b> leg that caused some internal bleeding. He was taken to Murdoch Hospital and recovered quickly.|$|E
2500|$|Crandon used a {{trick in}} an attempt to fool psychical {{researchers}} that the [...] "spirit" [...] voices in her séances did not come from her own mouth.

2500|$|In the 1840s and '50s, William Henry Lane and Thomas Dilward {{became the}} first African Americans to perform on the {{minstrel}} stage. All-black troupes followed as early as 1855. These companies emphasized that their ethnicity made them the only true delineators of black song and dance, with one advertisement describing a troupe as [...] "SEVEN SLAVES just from Alabama, who are EARNING THEIR FREEDOM by giving concerts {{under the guidance of}} their Northern friends." [...] White curiosity proved a powerful motivator, and the shows were patronized by people who wanted to see blacks acting [...] "spontaneously" [...] and [...] "naturally." [...] Promoters seized on this, one billing his troupe as [...] "THE DARKY AS HE IS AT HOME, DARKY LIFE IN THE CORNFIELD, CANEBRAKE, BARNYARD, AND ON THE LEVEE AND FLATBOAT." [...] Keeping with convention, black minstrels still <b>corked</b> the faces of at least the endmen. One commentator described a mostly uncorked black troupe as [...] "mulattoes of a medium shade except two, who were light. ... The end men were each rendered thoroughly black by burnt cork."
