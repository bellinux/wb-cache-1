30|$|In {{the lower}} arch, {{self-drilling}} 1.6 [*]×[*] 6  mm Aarhus™ (MediconeG, American Orthodontics) TADs were placed at an approximately 30 ° apical angle. Insertion was complete when {{the head of}} the TAD was flush with the labial mucosa. The TADs chosen for the palatal placement were 2  ×  9  mm Mondeal™ (GAC) TADs. The area of the palatal TAD placement was marked with a periodontal probe. Pilot 1.5 -mm holes were then created using a surgical hand-piece (speed 800  rpm) under sodium chloride irrigation until engagement was achieved. The palatal TADs were then placed using a <b>contra-angle</b> <b>handpiece</b> (torque setting of 35  Ncm, speed 30  rpm). A minimum clearance of 5  mm between the two palatal TADs was chosen to enable the placement of the impression caps. Healing caps were then placed on the palatal TADs, and a 0.12 % chlorhexidine mouth rinse was prescribed for daily use (Savacol, alcohol-free, Colgate).|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} low-temperature aging on the surface topography, phase transformation, biaxial flexural strength, and structural reliability of a ground Y-TZP ceramic. Disc-shaped specimens were manufactured and divided according to two factors: "grinding" - without grinding (as-sintered, Ctrl), grinding with an extra-fine diamond bur (25 µm Xfine) and coarse diamond bur (181 µm Coarse); and "low-temperature-aging" (absence or presence). Grinding was performed using a <b>contra-angle</b> <b>handpiece</b> under water-cooling. Aging was performed in an autoclave at 134 °C, under 2 bar, {{over a period of}} 20 h. Surface topography analysis showed an increase in roughness based on grit-size (Coarse>Xfine>Ctrl), and aging promoted different effects on roughness (Ctrl Ag Coarse). Grinding and aging promoted an increase in the amount of m-phase, although different susceptibilities to degradation were observed. Weibull analysis showed an increase in characteristic strength after grinding (Coarse=Xfine>Ctrl); however, distinct effects were observed for aging (Ctrl Coarse Ag). Weibull moduli were statistically similar. Grinding promoted an increase in characteristic strength {{as a result of an}} increase in m-phase content; when the Y-TZP surface was ground by coarse diamond burs followed by aging, characteristic strength was reduced, meaning the low-temperature degradation appeared to intensify for rougher Y-TZP surfaces...|$|E
50|$|In 1941, the {{brothers}} Karl and Wilhelm Dürr founded a precision mechanics workshop in Stuttgart-Feuerbach. After {{the end of}} the war, the workshop was reopened in Ludwigsburg. Articles for household use were produced, and they entered the field of compression technology. They entered the dental field in 1946 with the manufactured replacement parts for straight and <b>contra-angle</b> <b>handpieces.</b> The development and production of handpieces and angled instruments with water cooling was carried out a year later. In 1949, the company was registered at the IHK as the trading company K. u. W. Dürr Dental-Fabrikation, based in Ludwigsburg.|$|R
50|$|W&H has {{a history}} of over 120 years in the {{manufacture}} of dental products:The initials W&H refer to the Group’s two founders, Jean Weber and Hugo Hampel. In 1890, these two precision engineers founded a company in Berlin for the manufacture of straight and <b>contra-angle</b> <b>handpieces.</b> The fact that the initials of the two founders are the same as the German initials of their products (Handstück and Winkelstück) was perhaps an added incentive to use the letters W&H as the central element of the company’s logo.The company was restructured several times between 1920 and 1930. W&H became part of DEGUSSA and acquired international status through its global sales network. In 1944, W&H moved from Berlin (Germany) to Bürmoos (Austria). In March 1946, the Allies installed Peter Malata to administer the company. In 1958, W&H was acquired by the family of Peter and Hilde Malata, since when it has been a family-owned concern. During the Seventies, the company began the steady rise and expansion through which it has achieved its current status as a global player. For example, W&H Germany opened in 1964, followed by branches in France, Italy, Sweden and Great Britain. Peter Malata junior has been the Group’s CEO since 1996.|$|R
40|$|Dental handpieces {{are often}} {{difficult}} to disinfect. This {{is one of the}} main reasons for the considerable risk of cross-infections in dental offices. The aim of the present study was the evaluation of the disinfectant property of a recent, commercially available, automatic instrument, described as capable to clean, disinfect and lubricate dental handpieces. The following experimental evaluations were made: 1) antimicrobial activity of the disinfectant (glyoxalaldehyde) used. The method described by the European Committee for Standardization was followed. Test microorganisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. 2) disinfection of dental <b>handpieces</b> (69 <b>contra-angles</b> and 97 turbines of different marks). They were naturally infected using them on patients for 30 minutes at least. 3) disinfection of dental handpieces infected with bacterial suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes (beta-haemolyticus, group A), Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results of the first experiment showed a strong bactericidal power of the disinfectant with both the tested strains, after a contact time of only 1 minute. A great proportion of the dental handpieces tested during the second experiment were found disinfected: from 84 % through 89 % out of the various models of turbine handpieces; from 89 % through 100 % out of the models of <b>contra-angle</b> <b>handpieces.</b> Even though bacterial contamination level was low (about 10 (3) microorganisms per handpiece), a satisfactory disinfectant ability in natural conditions was found. The results of the third experiment were unclear. The tested instrument reduced 10 (5) - 10 (8) times the original bacterial count when the gram positive microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes) were used. On the other hand, when Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans were used, the results were different: the bacterial count was reduced 10 (6) - 10 (7) times in some cases, and only 10 (2) times in other cases. This difference was found in the tests made using the same attachment and in those made using various attachments. In conclusion, the tested instrument showed, in most cases, a good disinfectant property, but the presence of unclear results suggests that some technical modifications are required...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and objective: This study aims {{to analyze}} the {{influence}} of degree of curvature in the occurrence of apical deviations after the oscillatory preparation. Material and methods: Twenty simulated root canals of 21 mm in length {{were divided into two}} experimental groups according to the degree of curvature: 20 ° and 40 °. The canals were prepared using stainless steel instruments connected to a 10 : 1 speed reducing <b>contra-angle</b> <b>handpiece</b> with an automatized system of oscillatory movement. When analyzing the deviation, canals were filled with India ink and photographed in a standardized way {{with the aid of a}} platform, before and after the accomplishment of the preparation. In sequence, the images obtained were manipulated in Photoshop® Adobe program, preoperative and postoperative images were overlapped,and the deviation was measured with a ruler within 1 mm of working length and in the halfway of curvature. Data were submitted to analysis of variance (Anova) with a significance level of 5 %. Results and conclusion:Through the results obtained, it was possible to see that the greater the degree of curvature, the greater the deviation. In relation to the place of analysis,it was possible to realize that there was more deviation in the region of 1 mm of working length than in the halfway of curvature...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} study {{aimed to}} evaluate the effect of grinding and low-temperature aging on the fatigue limit of Y-TZP ceramics for frameworks and monolithic restorations. Disc specimens from each ceramic material, Lava Frame (3 M ESPE) and Zirlux FC (Ivoclar Vivadent) were manufactured according to ISO: 6872 - 2008 and assigned in accordance with two factors: (1) “surface treatment”-without treatment (as-sintered, Ctrl), grinding with coarse diamond bur (181 µm; Grinding); and (2) “low-temperature aging (LTD) ” – presence and absence. Grinding was performed using a <b>contra-angle</b> <b>handpiece</b> under constant water-cooling. LTD was simulated in an autoclave at 134 °C under 2 -bar pressure for 20 h. Mean flexural fatigue limits (20, 000 cycles) were determined under sinusoidal loading using stair case approach. For Lava ceramic, it was observed a statistical increase after grinding procedure and different behavior after LTD stimuli (Ctrl<Grinding; Ctrl<Ctrl Ltd; Grinding=Grinding Ltd); while for Zirlux, grinding and low-temperature aging promoted a statistical increase in the fatigue limit (Ctrl<Grinding; Ctrl<Ctrl Ltd; Grinding<Grinding Ltd). An important increase was observed in m-phase content after both stimuli (grinding and LTD), although with different intensities. Additionally, fatigue test did not promote increase of m-phase content. Thus, tested grinding and low temperature aging did not damage the fatigue limit values significantly for both materials evaluated, even though those conditions promoted increase in m-phase...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effects of grinding with diamond burs and low-temperature aging on the mechanical behavior (biaxial flexural strength and structural reliability), surface topography, and phase transformation of a Y-TZP ceramic for monolithic dental restorations. Disc-shaped specimens (Zirlux FC, Ivoclar Vivadent) were manufactured according to ISO 6872 (2008) and divided in accordance with two factors: “grinding — 3 levels” and “LTD — 2 levels”. Grinding was performed using a <b>contra-angle</b> <b>handpiece</b> under constant water-cooling with different grit-sizes (extra-fine and coarse diamond burs). LTD was simulated in an autoclave at 134 °C, under a pressure of 2 bar, {{over a period of}} 20 h. Surface topography analysis showed an increase in roughness based on surface treatment grit-size (Coarse > Xfine > Ctrl), LTD did not influence roughness values. Both grinding and LTD promoted an increase in the amount of m-phase, although different susceptibilities to degradation were observed. According to existing literature the increase of m-phase content is a direct indicative of Y-TZP degradation. Weibull analysis showed an increase in characteristic strength after grinding (Coarse = Xfine > Ctrl), while for LTD, distinct effects were observed (Ctrl < Ctrl LTD; Xfine = Xfine LTD and Coarse = Coarse LTD). Weibull moduli were statistically similar between all tested groups. Within the limits of this current study, it was feasible to notice that both aging in autoclave for 20 h (LTD) and grinding showed not to be detrimental to the mechanical properties of Zirlux FC Y-TZP ceramic...|$|E
30|$|In the {{conventional}} caries removal method, the carious dentin tissue was mechanically removed using a round tungsten-carbide bur (H 1 SE ISO 016, Komet, Brasseler, Lemgo, Germany) mounted in a <b>contra-angle</b> slow-speed <b>handpiece</b> (micromotor and <b>contra-angle,</b> KaVo Dental, Biberach, Germany) with air as the coolant. Each bur {{was replaced with}} a new one after every five preparations. In the chemomechanical caries removal method, Carisolv system (Carisolv gel multimix, MediTeam Dental, Göteborg, Sweden) was used by using specifically designed hand instruments for this procedure. Carisolv gel was applied on the carious dentin surface for 30  s according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the softened dentin was excavated with # 2, # 3 and # 4 instruments. When the gel became cloudy it was rinsed with water and removed together with the dissolved carious dentin. Fresh gel was then applied and the cavity floor was repeatedly scraped until the gel became clear. For the laser caries removal technique, an Er:YAG laser (KaVo, Biberach, Germany) was applied with No: 2060 non-contact treatment (KaVo, Biberach, Germany) and in defocused mode under 15  ml/min water-cooling {{in accordance with the}} recommended parameters by the manufacturer (KaVo Key Laser 1243). The laser treated for removal of the carious dentin tissue had a 30.86  J/cm 2, pulse energy 250  mJ and pulse frequency 4  Hz. The diameter of the laser beam treated from laser tip to dentin surface was 0.9  mm. The laser handpiece was mounted in a micro-manipulator (KITE-TB-L, World Precision Instruments, London, UK) to ensure that the laser beam was delivered perpendicular to the dentin surface at constant working distance of 10  mm.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: This study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} {{the design and}} dimensions of five different brands of orthodontic mini-implants, {{as well as their}} influence on torsional fracture strength. Methods: Fifty mini-implants were divided into five groups corresponding to different manufactures (DEN, RMO, CON, NEO, SIN). Twenty-five mini-implants were subjected to fracture test by torsion in the neck and the tip, through arbors attached to a Universal Mechanical Testing Machine. The other 25 mini-implants were subjected to insertion torque test into blocks of pork ribs using a torquimeter and <b>contra-angle</b> <b>handpiece</b> mounted in a surgical motor. The shape of the active tip of the mini-implants was evaluated under microscopy. The non-parametric Friedman test and Snedecor’s F in analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to evaluate the differences between groups. Results: The fracture torque of the neck ranged from 23. 45 N. cm (DEN) to 34. 82 N. cm (SIN), and of the tip ranged from 9. 35 N. cm (CON) to 24. 36 N. cm (NEO). Insertion torque values ranged from 6. 6 N. cm (RMO) to 10. 2 N. cm (NEO). The characteristics that most influenced the results were outer diameter, inner diameter, the ratio between internal and external diameters, and the existence of milling in the apical region of the mini-implant. Conclusions: The fracture torques were different for both the neck and the tip of the five types evaluated. NEO and SIN mini-implants showed the highest resistance to fracture of the neck and tip. The fracture torques of both tip and neck were higher than the torque required to insert mini-implants...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to {{evaluate}} and compare the efficiency of four protocols of adhesive remnant removal and polishing after bracket debonding on enamel surfaces using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and to compare the time spent to remove resin remnants. Materials and Methods: The present study was a comparative study, in which brackets were bonded on forty freshly extracted human premolar teeth. They were debonded after 24 h and removal of remnant adhesive to {{as close as possible}} to the original condition using tungsten carbide burs (TCBs) (30 flutted) with low-speed <b>contra-angle</b> <b>handpiece,</b> Super Snap ® discs (course, medium, fine, and superfine), TCB + Brownie and Greenie (BG) polishers, and TCB + Super Snap ® discs. The surfaces were evaluated under SEM and graded according to the modified surface roughness index. Time taken to remove the residual adhesive was recorded using a stopwatch. Results were subjected to statistical analysis. Results: Super Snap ® discs showed a smooth surface with minimal scratches. TCB resulted in an irregular enamel surface in SEM evaluation, showing horizontal scars with a consistent pattern and left remnants on the enamel surfaces. TCB followed by Super Snap ® discs produced some scratches on the enamel surface. The mean time was significantly higher in Group I than the other three groups (P = 0. 000). The mean time was significantly lower in Group II than the other three groups (P = 0. 000). TCB took the least amount of time followed by TCB + stainless steel and TCB + BG polishers. Conclusion: Enamel surface was restored as close to the original using the Super Snap ® discs. TCB produced a very rough surface, but it is an efficient and least time-consuming procedure. The resultant enamel surface with enamel scars needs to be finished by other polishing techniques after bulk removal using TCB as the sequential use of Super Snap ® discs and polishers is less aggressive in removing residual bonding resin and results in apparently better surface finish causing less damage to the enamel...|$|E
