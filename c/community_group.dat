5|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{destruction}} of the Quino checkerspot butterfly were raised by the <b>community</b> <b>group</b> Preserve South Bay. That group sued the developer as well as Caltrans and SANDAG in August 1999, following the latter's approval for the project. Early the next year, an environmental impact report suggested that Bonita might face negative effects from the freeway, such as noise and having the roadway divide the community. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) allowed the project that year, even though the Environmental Protection Agency objected to it. A contractor for the project was soon retained by California Transportation Ventures. Another group, Citizens for 125, obtained 7,000 signatures in support of the road.|$|E

People may turn to friends, kin or community members for assistance in times of hardship and need.

50|$|The {{analytical}} {{subject of}} the RVMI is an analysis of local <b>community</b> <b>groups</b> that are formed within a specific area. The RVMI focusses on local <b>community</b> <b>groups</b> {{because they are the}} origin and the basis of ‘vibrancy’, being the organisational form of people that act jointly. Depending on the actions the <b>community</b> <b>groups</b> take (e.g. cooperation) they can make a place more or less vibrant. On the basis of this pattern the RVMI proposes a ‘catalogue’ of quantitative and qualitative questions on the role of <b>community</b> <b>groups</b> that can be visualized and interpreted. The first field tests are scheduled for early 2013.|$|R
5|$|In 1999, {{the nonprofit}} {{organization}} Friends of the High Line {{was formed by}} Joshua David and Robert Hammond, residents of the neighborhood that the line ran through. They advocated for the line's preservation and reuse as public open space, {{so that it would}} become an elevated park or greenway, similar to the Promenade Plantée in Paris. The organization was initially formed as a small <b>community</b> <b>group</b> to advocate for the High Line’s preservation and transformation {{at a time when the}} historic structure was under the threat of demolition during Rudy Giuliani’s second mayoral term.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Presentation College {{went into}} administration. It {{was taken over}} by the Society of Licensed Victuallers and renamed The Elvian School. The school closed in 2010. Following its closure, Taylor Wimpey applied to build 193 new homes on the site, {{competing}} with a proposal by a <b>community</b> <b>group</b> (the West Reading Education Network) to reopen the site as a free school known as the WREN. The housing plan was rejected, but Taylor Wimpey then appealed to Reading Borough Council and submitted a revised plan for 120 homes, which left room for the school. The appeal was taken to the High Court, which ruled that the site should be used solely for education; the school opened for Year Seven pupils on 7 September 2015.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} Wiesenthal's protests, in late 1963 his centre in Vienna {{was taken over}} by a local <b>community</b> <b>group,</b> so he {{immediately}} set up a new independent office, funded using donations and his stipend from the Mossad. As the 20-year statute of limitations for German war crimes was about to expire, Wiesenthal began lobbying to have it extended or removed entirely. In March 1965 the Bundestag deferred the matter for five years, effectively extending the expiration date. Similar action was taken by the Austrian government. But as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions. Witnesses grew older and {{were less likely to be}} able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, as the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.|$|E
30|$|An {{interesting}} insight {{from this}} study is the discrepancy between the issues identified through interviews with the <b>community</b> <b>groups,</b> and the issues revealed in the participatory processes (section 6.1). The interviews with the <b>community</b> <b>groups</b> allowed uncovering specific social needs that were not addressed in the participatory processes. The findings thus suggest that <b>community</b> <b>groups</b> can be an appropriate vehicle for addressing the social dimension of transport and representing marginalized populations.|$|R
50|$|Some organisations, {{such as the}} Centre for Policy Studies, want to keep {{charities}} and <b>community</b> <b>groups</b> out of politics. Many NGOs and <b>community</b> <b>groups</b> are wary of campaigning. They worry about being political or offending their funders.|$|R

The club returned to Raydale Park in May 2009 which it now leases from the Raydale Partnership, a <b>community</b> <b>group</b> of which Gretna Supporters Society is a member.|$|E
30|$|As a result, {{transport}} {{is often}} “neglected” in {{the agenda of}} the <b>community</b> <b>groups.</b> The lack of interest and resources was thus seen, together with the approach of the borough to the participatory process, as a main reason for the low involvement of the <b>community</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R

The race became an annual tradition, although it ceased during World War I.|$|E

25|$|The Arlington Baths Club is {{the oldest}} {{swimming}} club in the world, founded in 1870. The Club in Arlington Street, in the Woodlands area {{of the city is}} still thriving today.

The Arlington inspired other Swimming Clubs and the Western Baths, which opened in 1876, is also still in existence in nearby Hillhead. Most of Glasgow's Victorian and Edwardian Municipal Pools have been closed or demolished, with the city council investing in large new leisure centres such as Tollcross, Springburn, Gorbals, Scotstoun and Bellahouston.
