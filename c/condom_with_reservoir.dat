40|$|Abstract Background Although HIV {{prevalence}} {{has remained}} low in Laos thus far, {{there is reason}} to be concerned that Lao male-to-female (MtF) transgender persons (kathoy) and their partners may facilitate the spread of HIV. Little is known about how to most effectively reach kathoy with HIV prevention programming. This paper evaluates an intervention with Lao kathoy with the objective of increasing safe sex with regular and casual partners. Methods Quantitative surveys were administered in November 2004 (n = 288) and June 2006 (n = 415) using time location sampling at venues where kathoy were known to congregate. Respondents were aged 15 - 35 and from three urban centers in Laos. UNIANOVA tests were used to compare baseline and follow-up survey data and to evaluate the impact of PSI's kathoy-specific interventions on items that changed significantly over time. Results Exposure to the intervention was associated with higher levels of condom use at last anal sex with casual partners and greater use of water-based lubricant. Exposure was also linked to improved perceptions of product availability for condoms and water-based lubricant. Knowledge about the importance of consistent condom use improved over time as well as the need to use <b>condoms</b> <b>with</b> regular partners. Some HIV knowledge decreased over time and the intention to use <b>condoms</b> <b>with</b> casual partners when water-based lubricant is available also declined. Conclusions Study results demonstrate the feasibility of reaching kathoy with an integrated social marketing approach; combining product promotion, peer education, and other types of interpersonal communication. The approach was successful at increasing <b>condom</b> use <b>with</b> casual partners and water-based lubricant use, but the importance of using <b>condoms</b> along <b>with</b> water-based lubricant must be emphasized and modified strategies are required for improving <b>condom</b> use <b>with</b> boyfriends. Future messages should emphasize consistent <b>condom</b> use <b>with</b> all types of partners as well as improve knowledge and correct misconceptions about HIV and AIDS, STIs, condom use, and lubricant use. It is also important that authorities create an enabling environment to support such interventions and help foster behavior change. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audience: French Guiana is the French {{territory}} {{that is most}} affected by HIV. AIDS incidence {{is much higher than}} in mainland France and sex work seems to be an important driver of the epidemic. The objective {{of this study was to}} describe consistent condom use among female sex workers with their clients and their intimate partners and to identify determinants of non-use of condoms. An HIV/AIDS Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviours and Practices survey was conducted in 2009 - 2010 among sex workers in French Guiana. A total of 477 sex workers were interviewed. Female sex workers were more likely to use <b>condoms</b> <b>with</b> their clients (97 %) than with their intimate partners (45 %). The factors associated <b>with</b> non-consistent <b>condom</b> use <b>with</b> the intimate partner were having had an abortion, feeling at risk for HIV, not evaluating one's own risk for HIV, living as a couple, being Dominican, not feeling comfortable asking intimate partners to use condoms. Although a high proportion of female sex workers declared using <b>condoms</b> <b>with</b> commercial partners, there is still room for improvement in the prevention of transmission with both commercial and intimate partners...|$|R

Aims and Objective: The study was undertaken {{with the objective}} to find any association between self reported condom use and incident STIs/ RTIs among High Risk Group such as Female Sex Workers. Methodology: It is a cross sectional study design carried out from August 2009 â&# 8364;&# 8220; June 2010, comprising of 519 Female Sex Workers of Surat City who are the beneficiaries of SAHYOG MAHILA MANDAL and EKTA MAHILA MANDAL (CBOs) and PARAS-PSM Project.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: To better {{understand}} trends in {{sexually transmitted infection}} (STI) prevention, specifically low prevalence of <b>condom</b> use <b>with</b> temporary partners, {{the aim of this}} study was to examine factors associated <b>with</b> <b>condom</b> use and perceptions of STI risk amongst individuals at risk, with the underlying assumption that STI risk perceptions and STI prevention behaviors are correlated. METHODS: A national population-based survey on human papillomavirus (HPV) and sexual habits of young adults aged 18 - 30 was conducted in Sweden in 2007, with 1712 men and 8855 women participating. Regression analyses stratified by gender were performed to measure <b>condom</b> use <b>with</b> temporary partners and STI risk perception. RESULTS: Men's condom use was not associated with STI risk perception while women's was. Awareness of and disease severity perceptions were not associated <b>with</b> either <b>condom</b> use or risk perception though education level correlated <b>with</b> <b>condom</b> use. Women's young age at sexual debut was associated with a higher risk of non-condom use later in life (OR 1. 95 95 % CI: 1. 46 - 2. 60). Women with immigrant mothers were less likely to report seldom/never use of <b>condoms</b> <b>with</b> temporary partners compared to women with Swedish-born mothers (OR 0. 53 95 % CI: 0. 37 - 0. 77). Correlates to STI risk perception differ substantially between sexes. Number of reported temporary partners was the only factor associated for both men and women <b>with</b> <b>condom</b> use and STI risk perception. CONCLUSIONS: Public health interventions advocating <b>condom</b> use <b>with</b> new partners could consider employing tactics besides those which primarily aim to increase knowledge or self-perceived risk if they are to be more effective in STI reduction. Gender-specific prevention strategies could be effective considering the differences found in this study...|$|R

Based on descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses, the authors also demonstrate to a degree not previously shown in the current literature that married men from most countries report using <b>condoms</b> <b>with</b> extramarital partners about as frequently as unmarried men. However, married women from most countries included use <b>condoms</b> <b>with</b> extramarital partners less frequently than unmarried women. This result is especially troubling because marriage usually ensures regular sexual intercourse, providing more opportunities to pass HIV from extramarital partner to spouse than an unmarried person who may also have multiple partners but not as regular sexual intercourse.

40|$|Commercial sex plays a {{critical}} role in rapidly increasing heterosexual transmission of HIV in China. Low-paid female sex workers (FSWs) are especially vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Because of the illegality and stigma associated with sex work, FSWs may constantly live with fears in their daily life. Based on cross-sectional study of 794 low-paid FSWs in China we described their psychological fears related to commercial sex and examined the associations between fears and HIV-related behaviors. Fear of HIV infection was significantly associated with consistent use of <b>condoms</b> <b>with</b> clients. However, fear of breaching sex worker identity significantly prevented the FSWs from consistently using <b>condoms</b> <b>with</b> clients and taking HIV tests. Fear of being arrested by the police was positively associated with consistent use of condoms but negatively associated with accessing HIV prevention services.
